annihilator
of space

  to be within arms reach of distant
cities it is only necessary to be within
arms reach of a bell telephone it
annihilates space and provides instanta-
neous communication both near and far

  there can be no boundaries to a tele-
phone system as it is now understood
and demanded every community is
a center from which people desire com
nunication in every direction always
with contiguous territory often with
distant points each individual user
may at any moment need the long
distance lines which radiate from his
local center

  an exchange which is purely local
has a certain value if in addition to
its local connections it has connections
with other contiguous localities it has
a largely increased value

  if it is universal in its connections and
inter-communications it is indispens-
able to all those whose social or business
relations are more than purely local

  a telephone system which under-
takes to meet the full requirements of
the public must cover with its ex-
changes and connecting links the whole
country

            the bell telephone system annihilates space for
            the business man to-day it brings him and any of
            his far-away social or business interests together

railroad men who are members

of congress

among the leading law-makers of the nation are men who began with
the section-gang and the roundhouse crew whose early
struggles led them to success

when a man starts in life as a tallow-pot and looks forward to the time
when he will be elected to either the senate or congress of the united
states there is a gaping chasm between the two extremes yet we pub-
lish in this issue of the railroad mans magazine the personal stories of
some of the most noted men now in our congress who began life in some of the
lowliest positions known to railroading and at a time when the work was not
so well advanced nor promotion so certain as it is to-day

    some of these personal narratives read more like romance than truth
they tell of hardships and of those seemingly insuperable obstacles that block
the way of all men who are not born a tag on a money-bag but must work
their way by their own efforts to the top

    have you ever been a railroad man we asked these various men now
representing us in washington and the invariable reply was  have i ever been
a railroad man accompanied by a smile and a far-away look as if the speaker
was taking himself back to the days that were dear to him-days that he can
never forget

    so here boys are the true stories of senator carter of montana senator
cummins of iowa senator warren of wyoming senator shively of indiana
senator perkins of california senator lorimer of illinois senator nixon of
nevada congressman martin of colorado congressman anderson of ohio
congressman norris of nebraska congressman murphy of missouri and con-
gressman cassidy of ohio all of whom are proud of the fact that they are ex-
failroad men we are proud indeed to be able to record such a list there is
something about the rough-and-ready life along the right-of-way that puts
stamina into men who have undergone its seasoning influence and makes them

the railroad mans magazine

pay little heed to the smaller trials and tribulations that so often prove stum-
bling-blocks on the uneven road to success railroads from the beginning
have proved poor places for quitters and the men who have climbed from the
ranks and finally won their way to executive seats at the nations capital are
frank in admitting that they have gained much from association with their fellow
workmen and were in the habit of taking hard knocks with a smile

senator carter

dra-u from a iliotogriith cotyrighted by harris  ewing

began as fireman

by thomas henry carter united states senator
from montana

at y railroad career was not of much im-
portance or of long duration i be-
gan by driving a mule team on the grade of
a new road extending west from clinton illi-
nois and later on the illinois and south-
eastern railroad

  following this i drove a team hauling
stone timber etc for the roundhouse and
small machine-shop built at pana i had
fully made up my mind that railroading
should be my lifes work but fate and the
master mechanic willed it otherwise i never
got any higher in railroad work although i
had strong ambition to become a locomotive
fireman

  while plowing corn near the illinois cen-
tral tracks i envied the lot of the men on
the passing engines who seemed to be stir-
ring up a cool breeze and having a good
time i thought it all out whileworking on
the farm and finally decided that i would
be much happier railroading-then i could
see the world

   even concluded that i would like to be-
gin my career as fireman in my imagina-
tion i lived over the joys that were to come
when with the engineer i would be flying
over the miles of wild west prairies the glare
of the hot embers scorching my cheek as i
fed the engine with coal and then the wind
of the fresh outdoors cooling my face as we
flew over the rails

  oh it would be life real and earnest-
and one day when a shower made the ground
too wet to plow i laid off and walked to the
roundhouse in the village to make my appli-
cation

  i was bent on securing a position as fire-
man but the formidable appearance of the
master mechanic and the distant attitude of
every one about the place reduced my self-
confidence to such a degree that i finally
concluded it would be safer to ask for a job
wiping engines

  with this reduced purpose in mind i
stayed about the place for half an hour or so
while the master mechanic talked with some
important-looking persons

  finally when the conversation was ended
he stepped aside to look over some detached
work and i accosted him and with much
timidity many misgivings and a husky voice
said

  mister i want a job wiping

  he turned looked me over from head to
railroad men who are members of congress



foot and walked away without making any
reply

  this apparently scornful inspection made
me conscious of my lack of style the truth
is my clothes were very meager consisting
of a rough straw hat check shirt and blue
overalls rolled up pretty well to the knees to
keep them out of the mud

  i was barefooted freckle-faced and bash-
ful the first blush of confusion over i be-
came deeply conscious humiliated and an-
gry but i could do nothing save suffer and
walk away

  mr ladd the master mechanic was un-
doubtedly a capable man in his line of busi-
ness but he had the brusk manner of the
old-time railroader

  ke subsequently went to brazil to take
employment as master mechanic of the gov-
ernment railway system and never returned
to this country

  he did not mean to treat me with contempt
nor to hurt my wounded feelings-but he did
both he also put an end to my quest for
railroad employment i never made another
trial in that direction

  mr ladd unconsciously did me a great
service for i have ever since treated people
with the utmost consideration we cannot
always justly measure the motives of men
and we often judge too harshly but i have
always felt inclined to lend a sympathetic ear
to the request of a boy even if i did not
grant his petition

  a boy is supersensitive particularly dur-
ing the period of doubtful status when he is
neither a man nor a boy then he feels awk-
ward ungainly and out of place he lacks
the experience which leads to a philosophical
view and every slight inflicts pain and hu-
miliation

the happiness of hardship

by francis e warren united states senator
from wyoming

e arly in the spring of  i was fore-

   man of the tie-gang of the advance
party of men building the rock island from
des moines iowa westward

  there were from two hundred and fifty to
five hundred men working in the gang and
after building out twenty miles to the rac-
coon river i left the business on a call west
to mi present home cheyenne wyoming
and took charge of a place made vacant by
the illness of a man who had to travel for a
year

  years after that i was made a member of
the board of directors and later was ad-
vanced to the position of president of the
cheyenne and northern railroad running
one hundred odd miles northward from
cheyenne which afterward became a branch
of the ltnion pacific

   railroading in those pioneer days afforded
few comforts but more unexpected compen-

drawn from a photograph

sations in the way of amusements than you
find to-day but i can truthfully say that i
recall with pleasure the real happiness that
we got out of the hardships

   i have an abiding belief that railroading
is an excellent vocation for a wide-awake
and ambitious american boy

  i consider any young man lucky to-day
who is able to secure employment with a
railroad

facing danger and death

by john a martin representative from
colorado

    was born and brought up on the right-of-
way at home ive got tucked away the
overalls and jumper that constituted my uni-
form as a tallow-pot i am the first member of
the brotherhood of locomotive firemen ever
elected to congress and i am just as proud
of my membership in the brotherhood to-day
as when i fired an engine

  friends have frequently remarked to me
that if they had my railroad story to tell they
would never tire in telling it my father was
a railroad man and i have two brothers who
are locomotive engineers for four years i
worked for the santa fe in colorado as a
fireman having been promoted to that posi-

tion from engine-wiper prior to that time
i had had several years experience in grading
and track-laying and as a boy helped to
build the colorado midland the first stand-
ard-gage railroad across the rocky moun-
tains in colorado since i became a grown
man i worked a year on the section at 
per day but my railroad life terminated in
 as a result of the pullman strike

  there is as much difference between riding
on a locomotive and in a passenger-coach as
there is between a saddle horse and an auto-
mobile you never lose the sense of exhila-
ration caused by the motion of a good engine
traveling at high speed you feel the vi-
bration the throb and the life of her

  i have also been in some accidents the
first on the colorado midland was a disas-
trous one i was riding down the mountain
on a work-train engine drawing two cars on
which were three hundred men

  suddenly the track slipped off the dump
and i can still see the terrible scene a half-
dozen of the men were killed and fully
twenty crippled for life the engine was
no  and the accident occurred on a fri-
day september 

  as i got out of it in fairly good shape
although not exactly with a whole skin i
have since claimed that thirteen was my lucky
number i am not a bit superstitious about
thirteen

  everybody has read more or less about
railroad accidents in which it was said the
engine and trainmen had warnings or pre-
monitions of impending disaster i believe
there is very little superstition in my make-
up and yet for eighteen years i have car-
ried the firm conviction that i escaped death
in a collision as the result of some such fore-
warning

  it was a winter night i had forebodings
of danger before we started i was firing a
fast passenger-train which was several hours
late we were following an ore-train which
had orders to run ahead of us until overtaken
we overtook her backing in on a curve side-
track with no flag out plunging right into
the middle of the freight-train at a speed of
forty miles an hour

  glimpsing out of the left cab-window i
saw a red light ahead of us and with a
shout to the engineer i sprang to the right
gangway and out into the darkness

  ninety-nine times out of a hundred i
would have looked out of the left gangway
which was on the inside of the curve in
order that i might see ahead but as the
result of my nervous condition or whatever
railroad men who are members of congress



you call it i accurately apprehended the
exact condition and made the move that
saved my life

  had i even thrust my head out of the left
gangway i never would have drawn it back
as the engine struck on that side

   in making this trip i relieved another man
who confessed afterward that he laid off be-
cause of a like premonition he said to me

    when you climbed up in the cab to relieve
me i had a hunch that i was getting out of
it and you into it

  i told him the same thing

  at that time i was only firing extra and
had been on this engine several trips the last
trip in before the accident the regular man
reported the run did not go out until about

	pm arriving in denver about  am

  when i went over to the roundhouse to
clean the engine and get her ready for the
trip i scented danger ahead and was relieved
to see the regular man marked up for her

  notwithstanding this i continued more or
less uneasy all day and was sitting on my
bed about  pm when the train which
this engine would take out whistled in i
nearly jumped with delight at the thought of
not going out on her but my relief was short-
lived for in about fifteen minutes the call-
boy knocked at the door and said that the
train was being held an hour and that the
regular man had decided to lay off

  the danger really was ahead of me all the
time which explains why i did not feel re-
lieved even after the other fellow had report-
ed you can take it from me not only as the
result of my own experience but from life-
long association with railroad men that many
of them go knowingly into danger and death

  i know personally of cases where railroad
mens wives have begged them not to go out
when they too felt that they should not go
yet they went never to return alive

his modest chronicle

by benjamin f shively united states senator
from indiana

vfy railroad experience was really too
-	short to chronicle i worked only at

the foundation grading road-beds in st jo-
seph county indiana

  i did this work to tide me over a rough
place while studying and preparing to be a
teacher but my experience was too limited to
consider myself these days in the light of a

how i stalled a strike

by william lorimer united states senator from
illinois

hphirty-nine years ago i came to chi-
cago and the first job i held in the
line of railroading was on a street railroad
i began as conductor and i want to say that
it is the best school in the world for study-
ing humannature

  you can learn more about people and their
grievances on the end of a street-car than in
any otlier way in those days we had to work
from sixteen to eighteen hours a day and were
paid one-half as much money as the men are
now paid who work only twelve hours a day

  i was deeply interested in the social life
of the railway orders and organized the
street railway mens benevolent association


the railroad mans magazine

 our association was really a union to look
 after the general welfare and to settle any
 disputes or difficulties that might arise be-
 tween the members and the company

   we were a flamboyant lot of boys when any
 one of us was unjustly treated and it took
 a lot of persuasion to establish peace in the
 club or to quiet the spirit of indignation over
 such a procedure on the part of the company

    at midnight i used to call at the association
 headquarters and enjoyed talking over the
 news with the boys who had finished their run
 for the day our brotherhood was in a way
 what the union is to-day the least excuse
 against the company was sufficient to enlist
 the sympathies of the agitators

   i recollect one member of the association
 who had been discharged because his accounts
 did not tally the men were all up in arms
 to fight his battles and determined to demand
 that the company reinstate him

   i also remembered a little experience that i
 had had with the same conductor it is im-
 possible after having served in this capacity
 to board a street-car and not watch the con-
 ductor collecting fares it becomes second
 nature and i also claim that it is utterly
 impossible to keep an exact accounting

   one may be as honest as he can and still
 make mistakes by listening to a question
 asked and in some way be interrupted so that
 he will forget to ring up the fare

   but the man who had been discharged i
 had every reason to believe was crooked on
 more than one occasion i had detected him
 but i had said nothing however when the
 question of our association became involved
 in a fight with the company as a consequence
 of his championship i felt that it was time to
 interfere

   the boys were unanimous in their de-
 mands if that conductor were not rein-
 stated then the whole lot of us were to walk
 out on the principle of this injustice the
 discharge did not rankle their honest hearts
 so much as the thought of a dishonorable dis-
 charge which had blacklisted his name

   all kinds of socialistic speeches had been
 made and a majority of the members were
 so stirred that if a vote had been taken many
 families would have suffered in consequence

   i saw the trend of opinion in the mean-
 time the discharged man was proud of the
 good-fellowship that the club showed toward
 his trouble and unmindful of the suffering
 which would be meted out tc them and theirs
 as a direct outcome of their loyalty to him
 i think it was his selfish attitude that im-
 pelled jne to act as i did

  just when the feeling of bitterness was at
its height i went up to this man and whis-
pered 

   if you dont get up and ask these mem-
bers to drop this question and make a quiet
appeal to their reason you will force me to do
so if you do i shall tell them why the as-
sociation as a body should not exonerate
you i have watched your course for some
time and have done a little sleuthing on my
own account

  he changed color and in the course of the
evening made the speech that i suggested he
told them he was going to leave town any-
how and that it would be folly for them to
take up the fight to the extent of a strike and
more to that effect

  i am a railroad man too i build railroad
tunnels i have worked for the milwaukee
and st paul i have just completed the re-
building of a section of the pennsylvania i
built the illinois central the great western
the chicago burlington and quincy and in
fact there is nothing i cannot do in the con-
struction line myself i can truthfully state
that i am proud of my railroad experience

an early builder

by george c perkins united states senator
from california

t have been mixed up with the transporta-
 tion business pretty nearly a lifetime
but i have not been identified with the rail-
road end of it yet i had some experience
in that line too when i built a railroad in
california in 

  we built this short road of thirty miles or
so to connect with the pacific coast compa-
nys line of boats at port hartford califor-
nia the extension began at san luis obis-
po california that was my first successful
venture in railway building

  in the year  i made a survey in cali-
fornia from oroville to quincy along the
feather river but all my time was in vain
we were never able to finance the scheme and
it fell through to be taken up later and built
to connect with denver it is now known as
the western pacific company

  nothing has interested me so much as
transportation i guess my love for it was the
outcome of my boyhood spent before the mast
at seven dollars a month at any rate the life
appealed to me even in home ports and i set
about to make it a business the railroad
experience was but to further my interest in
steamboat transportation

an old-time express messenger

by albert b cummins united states senator
from iowa

tust after leaving the academy i became
a deputy surveyor and after a little
time spent as a civil engineer i became a vic-
tim of wanderlust and decided to go to iowa
for the west called me

  there i had my first experience in rail-
roading i secured employment as an express
messenger on the run between mcgregor and
st paul i grew tired of the work for our
route lay through a sparsely settled coun-
try and there was but little in the monot-
onous scenery to satisfy the imagination of
a roving boy so i resigned and once again
decided that i would make my fortune in the
east

  i stopped in indiana on my way back and
went to work as division engineei on the
cincinnati richmond and fort wayne rail-
road in  afterward i was promoted
to assistant chief engineer of the same road
at that time the road was in the course of
construction

  in the beginning i knew but little about-
railway construction but i believed that ones
success in life depended upon making up
ones mind to reach a certain goal and then
going ahead

  a short time after when the chief engi-
neer was summoned to an important position
with an eastern system his position was of-
fered me this was the first big problem i
had to wrestle with but i spent all that
night studying the construction of a new
bridge just completed that represented the
general type of construction of the others yet
to be built and which was the only hard
place on the line

  then the chief gave me two days which
he devoted to practical lectures on curves
gradients and bridge construction after
which i wrote a letter saying that i would
finish the road

  i did and put it into operation in the
limited time necessary to earn certain bo-
nuses

  then i built a road in michigan acting
as assistant chief engineer within three
years from the beginning of my railroad ex-
perience i was offered the position of chief
engineer of a road which has since then de-
veloped into the santa fe system but i

drawn from a thotograth by david b edmonston
washington d c

three years to it i have always valued the
education and the association

  twenty years after my experience as a
messenger while campaigning in iowa i
met the old crew - engineer fireman and
conductor-who were on my run in those
early days we had a pleasant hour in re-
calling old memories as we stood leaning
against a lunch-counter at the eating station
swapping yarns of bygone years

my longest hour

by arthur phillips murphy representative from
missouri

t was just seventeen years old when i be-
a gan railroading as a section-hand on the
st louis and frisco railroad of missouri
in the beginning my work was laying ties
putting new ties under the track tamping
them down surfacing the track laying rails
spiking them down etc and i did this for a
year or so carrying my nose-bag until i
thought i had saved enough to stop and go to
school in the daytime and study telegraphy
at night

  i procured a position as night operator
and three or four years later was promoted
to train-despatcher on the frisco and texas
and santa fe

  during my service as train-despatcher i
studied law and later resigned my position
with the santa fe to finish my law course
i was admitted to the bar at waynesville
missouri six months after severing my con-
nection with the railroad

  railroading is attractive work and has a
fascination all its own the- higher you get
in the service the greater becomes your re-
sponsibilities

  i distinctly remember one very trying hour
as train-despatcher-one that i shall not soon
forget

  i made a meeting-point for two trains in
the opposite direction and gave a freight-
train until a certain time to make a station
the operator disobeyed my orders and let
the trains out without delivering them

  after waiting sufficient time to hear from
the operator i called him on the wire and
asked him where the passenger-train was

  he answered theyre gone

  my hair began to raise i pictured the
disaster that would follow

   what are you going to do about those
two orders you have for them  i next
called

  i tried to raise him on the wire but i
could not

  he had closed his key and left the office
never to come back

  i at once ordered the wrecking outfit with-
out waiting to see whether they hit or not
then i began to conjecture how many people
had been killed fortunately they did not
strike having sighted each other on the main
track but i had a most uncomfortable hour
until i knew the truth i can most emphat-
ically state that it was the longest hour of
mv life

thirteen years of age and rose to bill-clerk
of the lake shore road when i was fifteen
at seventeen i was cashier of the lake erie
and western and agent of the same road at
nineteen

  railroading is a good educational founda-
tion for young men and the only drawback
seems to me that the service is only for the
men who are young however the educa-
tional advantage is helpful to a man through-
out his life and the force and discipline of
railroading surely equips a man for gradua-
tion from the university of hustle

  i was baggage-master at fremont on the
wheeling and lake erie with ambitions to
become superintendent when i gave it up for
commercial work but to railroading more
than all else i owe the foundation of what i
have accomplished

railroading in a mining-camp

by george s nixon united states senator
from nevada

af y railroad instruction began as a tele-
graph-operator at newcastle califor-
nia in february  i paid the station-
agent twenty dollars a month for my board
and received nothing for my services although
i was on duty from five oclock in the morning
until midnight

  but i learned telegraphy and the railway
and express business

  my parents chaffed me for my long hours
without pay but i replied  i am not work-
ing for the agent i am going to school and
working for myself

  my parents spent six months coming from
arkansas to california in a  prairie schoon-
er at the end of their journey with a few
pieces of furniture and an ox they started
ranching on fifteen acres of land which
they planted in plums peaches and apples

  my first useful work i remember was in
that orchard expert fruit-packers must
have sensitive fingers else they bruise every-
thing they touch and i first showed an apti-
tude for fruit-packing and worked like a
streak of chain lightning but my useful- 
ness did not end here and this led to my ac-
quaintance with the station-agent - and to
my railroad career

  the birds ate our fruit and father pur-
chased an old shotgun which he taught me
to fire with the reminder that i was not to
shoot the birds while they were in the trees
and thereby do more harm to the fruit and
foliage than the birds could do but to shoot
them on the wing

  i soon had a reputation as a wing shot
which attracted the attention of the agent at
newcastle who asked me to supply him with
quail for the mining-camps at one dollar
and fifty cents a dozen

  some days i shot six dozen quail but it
was long and tiresome work from early dawn
until late at night often covering a forty-mile
tramp to get my game

  my season began in the middle of october
and lasted until late in the winter and so
between quail-hunting and fruit-packing
there was little time to go to school

  i had saved four hundred dollars and my
station-agent friend advised me to learn tel-
egraphy i was delicate having malaria
and was glad when after fifteen months ap-
prenticeship as a telegrapher i was sent over
to the dry climate of nevada and put to
work at the station called browns

  this station one of the most forlorn spots
on earth was located in the center of the  old
forty-mile desert

  i was there just three months when i was
transferred to humboldt a dinner - station
which somewhat relieved the lonesomeness

  i recollect the first telegram i sent from
here and have a copy of it to-day the
english style of signing the writers name
first was followed by the sender it was
dated-

  oscar wiide

   cisco 

  a dreadfully dull journey good-by i have
  written

  i worked in humboldt until  and
went down to the old carson bell road one
night about eleven oclock i was writing by

congressman murphy

the railroad maxs magazine

a students lamp with a green shade which
to all appearances darkened the room from
the outside

  the blinds were down and all was as
quiet as a desert house can be when i heard
a rustle at the window

   i lowered my light still more and waited
for developments soon the rustling of the pa-

drawn ran a fhotograth -copyrighted by harris 
ewing washington d c

per blind began again there was a glass
out of one of the window-panes which left
an opening big enough for a slender body
and presently a mans foot was visible

   there was about twenty-five thousand dol-
lar in silver bullion in the safe and i knew
it was up to me to guard it the robber was
at a great disadvantage thinking i had gone
up-stairs to bed and that he had everything
to him-elf

  i stood for a minute wondering if i should
grab my wells-fargo shotgun and fire or
scare him off i decided on the latter course

  the intruders leg was inside the window
i crept up and gave it a dreadful wrench
there was a screech never in my life have
i seen quicker action than that man demon-
strated before i could raise the shade he
was scurrying across the sand-hills

  i aimed over his head and fired just to
remind him that i was on the job if lie ever
contemplated a future call but i was not
bothered by him again

  i was transferred to bellville a mining-
canip with a population of five hundred
this was a pretty wide-open town and there
were no officers each man was a law unto
himself

  i had been here just a week when a chap
came into the office and asked for an express
package addressed to him

  yes here it is i said and threw the
package before the little window where the
stranger stood leaning on his elbows

  i turned to get the bill for the package
was sent  collect and handed him the
book to sign this he did and started for
the door without paying me seven dollars and
fifty cents the amount of the bill

  you havent paid for this  i cried

  he stopped for a minute looked at me over
his shoulder and said

  look here sonny take your medicine
like a man its up to you to understand
your own way of doing business but in these
here parts i think it would be better for you
to collect your money before you give up the
goods

  he was gone before i had a chance to
think of my wells-fargo gun i could see
the force of his argument i must make
good the amount and i resolved to profit by
my lesson

  it was noon i closed the office and went
into the restaurant for my dinner in a very
unpleasant frame of mind there i met the
secretary of the mining company who had
just organized a gun club for the amusement
of shooting glass balls shot up from a trap

  he asked me to go into the field to see the
sport and having an hour to spare i agreed

  to my surprise i found the stranger who
had just cheated me one of the most enthu-
siastic members of this club i looked
him over without comment and when i was
asked to shoot five balls i accepted the in-
vitation

  my quail-hunting served me in good stead
and i hit every ball
railroad men who are members of congress



  then the stranger said ill bet you ten
dollars that you cant hit another five in suc-
cession

  i wont bet with you i answered but
i can break the balls

   after some persistence on his part i agreed
to bet with him provided that if he lost the
money should go to the club

  i broke the balls and he looked his admi-
ration and was game

   ill bet you twenty that you cant break
ten in succession

  he lost again

  now said i ill bet you thirty that
i can hit thirty balls ill leave my gun on
the ground uncocked and you may throw
five balls up at a time and i promise you to
reach for my gun cock it and smash the five
before they hit the earth

  he put up his money and the club won
that bet also

  after that fun i went back to the office
with the information that the stranger was a
tin-horn gambler and had always boasted of
his prowess with the gun to gain a point
i had gone through my shooting stunts with
all of the antics of long-practised skill to
make him lose his money to the club

  two weeks later the gambler came into the
office and said

  well sonny i guess it is about time to
get anotiier package i guess theres another
about due to-day eh  

  i looked over the packages and told him
he was right he handed me a twenty-dol-
lar bill i took the money found the old
bill and handed him five dollars change

  youve short-changed me  he began
ripping out a volley of sage-brush oaths

  my hand was on the wells-fargo gun and
i raised it my how he did get out of that
station i chuckled to myself after he was
out of sight on his way to the hotel and was
more than surprised to see him returning half
an hour later

  he had changed his clothes and was wear-
ing a tight-fitting pair of mexican trousers
and a thin shirt that wrapped his slim body
without a wrinkle

  i cocked the gun and was waiting for him
as he came nearer i could see that he was
unarmed and had dressed himself in that at-
tire to show me i had nothing to fear

  he paused outside the station and called
me to come out and hear what he thought of
me he put his hands up over his head and
asked me to search him if i thought it neces-
sary after looking at his scanty wardrobe

  i could see that he was sincere he

grabbed me by the hand and swore his admi-
ration for a kid who could get what belonged
to him in his own way

    i knew it was in you all right and was
just trying you out old man

   after that little altercation that man be-
came one of the best friends i ever had the
friendship has lasted all of these years

tf years devoted to the office side of the
business fits a man to enjoy the appella-
tion of railroader then i think i deserve some
consideration i served an apprenticeship of
fourteen years beginning as office-boy on the
l s and m s at cleveland ohio

i remained in the claims department during


the railroad mans magazine

that period i spent my evenings while in
this office studying and at night-school and
concluded to become a lawyer my hours in
the office made it easy for me to study

  i remained with the company until i was
admitted to the bar then i resigned to prac-
tise law i had no strenuous or exciting ex-
periences as the office end of it does not fur-

nish material of that kind but i do remem-
ber a siege of long hours that once fell to my
lot on the occasion of a wreck with a fast
freight-train at zanesville ohio

  i was sent out to take charge of the stock
of freight which had to be sorted and sent
along on its way or else replaced with new
stock i worked for thirty-six hours without
stopping food was brought to me from
time to time and i managed to keep awake
until the track was cleared

on the floating gang

by george w norris representative from
nebraska

jvfy experience as a railroad man has not
been extensive i was only employed
as a section-hand but i have often wondered
if i would not have reaped a better reward
if i had remained at that vocation and
worked my way up

  i worked as a section-hand on the wabash
railroad in ssq for a period of three
months in what is known as the  floating

gang-

  i had been studying at the state normal
school at valparaiso indiana to prepare
myself as a teacher when the school closed
i had no money to pay for my fare to toledo
ohio where i had been promised a place on
the following term

  i had been boarding myself in a cheap
haphazard way known only to students who
fight their battles for a coveted education

  i had a small grip-sack for my clothing
and concluded the best way i could reach
toledo to pass my examination was to beat
the railroads

  i started on a freight at night i crawled
into an empty car but by some bad luck i
was discovered and put off however i
managed to hide on the same train before it
pulled out which was easy to do at night
but my luck again deserted me

   this time i saw the little red caboose dis-
appear in the distance while i trudged wear-
ily along the track until i boarded another
freight bound eastward

  dead-beating is not as easy to accomplish
as some people claim and i was ignomin-
iously fired from three different freight-
trains before i succeeded in reaching my
destination

  when i arrived there i passed the exami-
nation all right but three months must pass
before my school would begin and i was
broke

  then it was that i applied for work in the
 floating gang whose work consisted chief-
ly in tamping up tracks and putting in new
steel

  in my judgment there was then and al-
ways has been an opportunity in railroad
service for advancement to good positions by
commencing in the section provided that the
applicant has sufficient education to perform
the duties of higher positions

  the railroad man who comes up this way
learns minute details that are of great value

running a blazer on hagan

by robert fulkerson hoffman

                   a sorry attempt at backbiting in
                   which the biter got badly bitten

am fully acquainted with mr
snivelys ability and with his
overzealousness

  that was the saving clause in
a letter which the general man-
ager wrote to the general super-
intendent and which that officer in turn
forwarded to masters the signal engineer
it should have saved snively but it did not
he was not big enough to properly assimi-
late it

   however the letter in total had the effect

of saving his job for the time being as mas-
ters had frankly recommended his removal
to some other sphere of usefulness in ful-
filment of what he saw as his duty he called
in snively from the line and laid the letter
before him without comment

  masters really did this from sheer good-
ness of heart and just there is where snivelys
salvation from himself should have resulted
instead a dull flush of mortification and
anger dyed his angular face an ugly red
and he walked out of the office after tossing

walked out of the office
after tossing the letter
back upon his superiors
desk




the railroad mans magazine

the letter back upon his superiors desk with-
out so much as a thank you

  that performance alone would have won
for him an instant discharge if masters had
held an entirely free hand in the matter but
the lamentable fact is that masters was not
thus free there were reasons chief of which
was that snively was the son of a professor
in a pine-stump college and the professor
long years ago had been the able teacher of
the present general manager the general
manager in turn felt that lie was paying an
unwritten obligation by trying in every
legitimate way to teach the younger snively
the science of railroading he intended only
that snively should have his chance fairly
and fully it is true but he did not yet under-
stand as did masters that snively was a
failure before he ever enlisted in the service

   so snivelys little bluff of tossing the let-
ter back disdainfully worked apparently
with masters and the youngster flounced
into the drafting-room and took his place
at his drawing-board

  he was a scrawny little runt he could
not help that three generations of escape
from the wholesome physical stimulus of the
anvil and the plow had dwarfed his body
and sharpened his wits more than goff on
one hand and bulldog pipes filled with over-
rented tobacco on the other could counter-
act in one generation

  filled with the petty prejudices of school
and campus he was now being badly upset
by the stirring practical applications of the
hurrying life about him just now he was
bitterly detesting with a hatred his eyes had
made no attempt to conceal the men whom
he had learned glibly to classify as muck-
ers chief of these being masters upon
whom he mentally assured himself he had
just run a beautiful blazer

  with that his self-esteem again took the
ascendant he thrashed over in his mind
the wording of the general managers letter
while he savagely jammed down the thumb-
tacks in preparation for a drawing that had
been assigned him by the time he had the
work well laid out he had reached the satisfy-
ing conclusion that the word overzealousness
was a stenographers error which had escaped
the notice of the writer at signing and the
reference to his ability fell like a healing dew
upon his wounded sensibilities

   therefore he straightened his small height
importantly before his drafting-table rolled
his shirt-sleeves higher upon his golf-browned
arms of pitiful meagerness hitched his small
trousers higher by the belt and glared quite

disdainfully round at the backs of those who
labored at the tables about him

  meanwhile masters returning the letter
to the general superintendent just across the
hallway was saying in conclusion of a very
serious-faced conversation

   oh yes hes smart as the rest of them
--but hes little little beyond helping

   well said the general superintendent
dubiously  give him another chance and
keep a tight rein on him

   put him out with graves on some of that
surprise test work graves can hold him
level maybe there is something worth while
in him if there is id like to find it for the
old mans sake-and so would you

  yes said masters quite-fieartily

  and that with the best intentions in the
world is the way the situation finally cul-
minated in a crisis for hagan very soon
afterward

  half an hour after the conference in the
general superintendents office the signal en-
gineers office-boy laid a folded note still
damp from the letter-press upon snivelys
drawing-board and was turning away with-
out comment when snively halted him
harshly

   here whats this   said he

   don know said the boy  mr mas-
ters said copy it in the letter-book and you
bet i copied it 

  properly addressed and dated the plain
and brief instruction read

    train no  will drop you off at babbler
   meet mr graves there to-night and work sub-
   ject to his orders on surprise signal tests untii
   recalled

  now be it known that these surprise tests
the setting of false signals surreptitiously
against engineers and firemen at unexpected
times and untoward places had been the sub-
ject of much acrimonious discussion before
its adoption but spirited as that official
discussion had been it was nothing as com-
pared with the bitter denunciation which the
practise had brought out among the train-
crews since its inauguration and the result-
ing discipline which had been applied from
time to time as the result of its disclosures

   it is too much like a low-down conspir-
acy the general superintendent had said in
the beginning of its consideration

   it is tempting a man to steal when he
is hungry hungry for time on his schedule
and a man who is not carrying that kind of
appetite is no good on an engine hes got
to eat up every minute on the face of his
running a blazer on hagan



watch or he is no good to us and it dont
seem fair to lay out behind a rock and hand
him that kind of loaded bun when hes doing
his busy best to make time honestly

that is all very good on the face of it
the general manager had replied  i will

  jim hagan big rough-spoken capable
jim with his bone-stirring laugh and steady
nerve and clear judgment that had carried
the mail through on time against almost in-
human odds on more than one occasion
hagan who had growled some and swore a

admit - to you - that

i	dont feel altogether
proud of the plan my-
self but we have had
entirely too many close
calls to collisions late-
ly and even though
there may be a point of
unwritten law that
where you conspire to
have a man commit
an offense you become
equally guity i want this thing tried out
for a while at least until we get some idea
of what is really to be expected

  that of course had closed the discussion
as far as officialdom was concerned and the
hateful and hated spy-system of signaling
had immediately gone into effect

little and laughed
more but who had al-
ways come through on
time had been the first
m a n caught running
past a red home-signal
when he had reason to
believe that the block
would clear before he
struck trouble

the block had
cleared safely enough
but somebody had lain behind the bank of a
near-by cut and made the first serious dent in
hagans spotless record of six years of ban-
ner engine-running

  hagan was indignant disgusted eloquent
fighting mad by turns after the record was
posted and the punishment applied but it

if i ever catch you monkeying a
semaphore light against me
youll get about six months
under water 


the railroad mans magazine

thats one of the most dangerous ruffians on
that engine ive ever seen

all availed nothing for him he had to take
his medicine his clean record was gone
after that he never ran by a red light of a
horizontal semaphore - arm no matter how
good the chances seemed and that was as it
should have been

  but from the night on which he was caught
stealing he never saw a man climb a signal-
mast or paint a switch - target without ma-
king uncomplimentary remarks about his
antecedents and his probable eternal welfare
hagan was mad in short deep down and all
the way through

  therefore when young snively sauntered
up alongside of hagans engine on the eve-
ning that he received orders to meet graves
at babbler hagan lowered uis head and
charged around the point of the pilt with
the manner of a man who is forcibly tearing
himself away from his dearest vice he

wanted to thrash spank snively on
sight and of course he knew that would
not do so he fled to the farther side of
the engine and snively made the mis-
take of following him up

  snively was blissfully unaware of the
smoldering fires of wrath which the
signal-departments spy system had kin-
dled he had fixed ideas about holding
hard for ideals and saw nothing very
stirring about trapping a proud old vet-
eran as hagan had been trapped or in
putting the resultant smirch upon a vet-
eran record in fact the job was just
about up to snivelys measure

  he liked it and was so free of all
question of shame in the premises that
he did not in the least understand that
hagan and every other engineer on the
line knew every man in the signaling
department and hated them all so far
as they could see them

  he followed hagan around the pilot
quite confidently therefore somewhat
patronizingly it must be confessed and
when the engineer could find no further
excuse for prodding over and between
the engine-frames with torch and oiler
he turned and faced him savagely

   ill ride out to babbler on the en-
gine with you to-night said snively
handing out a card-pass for hagans in-
spection  guess i will take a look at
the signals going out

  maybe you will replied hagan
depositing torch and oiler on the broad
top of the guides

  he examined the pass carefully as
though hoping to find a defect find-
ing none after a careful search of both sides
of the card he returned it jerkily and said
well i guess youll have to get aboard
so youre smelling around after signals eh
um-huh well mebbe we can show you
some between here and babbler but theyll be
moving some 

  he picked up his torch and tools with
that and started toward the engine-step at
the gangway while snively trailed in silence
at the rear

  then just when he had raised his foot to
mount to the cab hagan had a vision of that
one dark blot recently fallen uppn his rail-
road escutcheon his foot dropped with a
thud to the ground and he turned upon
snively with the sort of smile that those
who knew hagan best never liked to see

   climb up bub said he stepping aside
with a wide flourish of his torch in the sur-
wbtm 

running a blazer on hagan	

rounding blackness  and while you are
climbing let me tell you this

  if i ever catch you monkeying a sema-
phore light against me youll get about six
months under water if theres a borrow-pit
handy and to stand committed until com-
plied with he added with a slight tighten-
ing of the smile

  thats no threat son you can tell your
parents he continued in the same counter-
feit of good-humor when they had mounted
to the cab

   just a fair promise that your services
will be recognized and rewarded if i can
help you out of the bushes any

  what snively said is of very little conse-
quence

   in fact he had no clear recollection imme-
diately afterward of having said anything
the whole thing was to him so incompre-
hensible so utterly treasonable and absurd
that he did not get the sting of it fairly fixed
in his mind until hagan had whirled the
west-bound mail over its prescribed course
and upon its particular minute had dropped
him on the little platform at babbler

  then as he stood in the yellow glow that
fell from the bay window of the telegraph-
office and watched the triangle of red tail-
lights following the roar of hagans receding
engine farther and farther into the lonesome
night the sting of the affront that had been
put-upon him began to rankle in his small
mind and he soon gave the proof of the
littleness that masters had discovered by plot-
ting a cheap sort of revenge upon hagan

    bub borrow-pit six months  why
the fellow had talked to him as though he
were an immature tramp 

  he astonished the operator by entering a
sudden interruption into the wire report of
the passage of the mail

   say thats one of the most dangerous
ruffians orf that engine ive ever seen 
who queried the operator in mild
surprise when he had finished his report to
the despatcher

  who hagan oh hagans all right
quess you never saw very many did you  
hazarded the operator good-naturedly he
was hauling out a pipe in great unconcern
the mail west was safely through his baili-
wick once more which seemed to him to be
the main issue of present importance

   well hed better be replied snively
evasively  when does he come back  

   makes a turn-around at kansas city
and comes through here again at midnight
on the mail east why 

 	rr	

                      

  oh nothing special has mr graves
been here to-day

   kansas city replied the operator briefly

  oh no replied snively with an air of
superior knowledge  i was to meet him
here to-night

   you will if you wait until hagan comes
east with the mail

   how do you know i will   demanded
snively

   read it on the side of a box car replied
the operator shortly turning to the papers
that littered his desk

  his good-humor had yielded and vanished
before the persistent churlishness of snively
the sullen roar of the water among the piers
of the bridge over big babbler drifted in
through the open windows and emphasized
the silence that followed the operators last
announcement

  snively stood for a moment longer looking
in through the window upon the operator
who paid him no further attention in the
drear loneliness of the isolated station and
the hostile atmosphere that he had created
the world seemed suddenly grown a very
cold and soulless place he was aching with
a sense of self-pity and unreasonable wrong

  turning then from the window he
walked the short length of the platform and
stood in the darkness at its end looking away
to where the recently installed distant signal
brightly showed the beginning of the bab-
bler block nearer the home-signal sent up
its mast into the night and both he knew
were blazoning forth their silent messages to
the line that the block was clear and all was
well

  likewise he scanned the signals home and
distant upon the paralleling double track
then definitely his half-matured plan to run
a blazer on hagan was formed why wait
for the arrival of mr graves he knew
the process quite as well as graves did how
to manipulate the magnets drop the disk to
show red on the home-signal after hagan had
passed the distant at clear and then restore
the clear of the home-signal when hagan
stopped or failed to stop

  capital hagan had to stop anyway to
drop graves no reason why he should not
be tried out on a stop short of the station and
let the record be turned in by graves with
the other reports

  yes snively knew the process but what
he did not know was that for reasons suffi-
cient to the operating department hagan
would return that night upon the left-hand
track instead of the right and that upon the


the railroad mans magazine

parallel right-hand track a heavy freight
was even then bowling toward him through
the darkness from the same direction

  had he known those things he would also
have known that hagan with his fast mail
would be running the freight a close race
when later they arrived at the babbler block
but he kept widely clear of the obnoxious
operator and loitered out to the river and
back before making his preparations near the
home-signal mast

  when finally he heard the distant sound
of an engine whistle and saw the faint up-
ward glow of a headlight hidden among the
bluffs he established himself behind a high
barricade of cord-wood that stood on the apex
of the curve between the tracks and the water-
filled borrow-pits which had earlier contrib-
uted to the filled approach to the bridge

  presently the full glare of a headlight
broke clear in the last notch of the bluffs
across the river and the bright shaft of light
came driving and blinking through the slant
of the bridge over the big babbler

  close up behind it in the cab was dave
tate with the recollection of a clear distant
signal just passed and with the home-signal

showing high and clear before him when
his engine shot out of the end of the bridge
following the engine were fifteen cars of light
freight fitted with air-brakesand back of
them rolling rapidly were twelve cars of
heavy dead freight-non-air

  it was a bad make-up but dave took them
as he got them with a final look at the
clear home-signal he opened out fully as he
cleared the bridge and the engine responded
with a rising stammering roar from the stack
then the home-signal suddenly went red

  daves hand dropped the throttle shut at
a single shove and fell swiftly upon the
brake-valve with no time for thought of air
or non-air the brakes crashed home upon
the fifteen forward cars and the twelve free
loads behind them lunged forward against
them and hunched and crowded and groaned
in their interrupted flight

  the dark crowding line stood the fright-
ful strain until tate and his engine with
nearly half of the train had been crowded
bucked pounded past the home-signal mast
with its light again turned suddenly to clear

  then the three light box cars at the middle
of the train were suddenly lifted and cata-

towered higher than the cord-wood behind which snively had secreted himself
running a blazer on hagan



pulted into the air they fell a splintered
and cluttered mass upon the opposite track
and mounted to a ragged pyramid of broken
timbers and twisted trucks that towered
higher than the cord - wood behind which
snively had secreted himself

  while the ruin was grinding its way into
final silence a second bright swifter gleam
had been racing toward it among the bluffs
across the river

   no friendly bar of steel or vagrant truck
in all the ruin had so fallen as to set the dis-
tant signal of the parallel track to warning
position hagan with the mail shot past
the distant saw the home at clear saw the
tail-lights of the freight all safe and intact
upon the opposite track and he swept
through the bridge and dashed into the wreck
with only a futile movement of his left hand

  he had not a chance the time was too
short and the curve too sharp his engine
plowed into the clutter of freight-cars
writhed for an instant among them and then
leaped with a sharp crash of steam escaping
from broken pipes into the crest of it all

  she toppled and hung and glided outward
across the curve for a single instant and
then engine crew and the mail-cars dashed
down with a grinding roar among the flying
cord-wood the borrow-pits sent up a yel-
low wash of waters and took the mail into
their depths

  that night and the following day the clay-
pits held their secrets grudgingly on the
second night of fierce laboring they began
to give them up under the pitiless search of
the wrecking-cranes

  hagan came first then they bore his
fireman away and laid him on the little sta-
tion platform beside hagan

  well thats all i guess said the
wrecking foreman

  he surreptitiously smeared a vagrant tear
or two across his browned cheeks with the
back of his hand while he sloshed carefully
back and forth in hip-boots upon the cord-
wood which was beaten into the bottom of
the pits like a crude floor

  no said the night operator quite posi-
tively  there is one more

  he had been quietly comparing notes with
tate who had been doing sleepless duty on
the engine of the wreck-train

   how do you make that out   challenged
the wreck-master instantly all business again
with not a trace of sentiment

   i found this on the edge of the clay-pit
last night replied the operator  and unless
the fellow that owned it is running yet hes
here 

  he drew from his pocket and held upon
his open palm a dainty bit of a brier pipe
with a slender curving stem of amber

  there was a young fellow smoked that
pipe at my window a while before this thing
started he went away and didnt come back
tate here says the home-signal- went from
clear to red and back to clear all after his
engine came out of the bridge

   what do you say dave  

  thats what i say replied tate with
not a trace of venom

   somebodv monkeyed the home - signal
where is he 

  the strange floor of the pits came up
stick by stick finally there came with it
the pitiful last of snivelys running of a
blazer on hagan

  his offense was great and his conception
of things was very small but somehow when
the veterans had laid him beside hagan and
the fireman and looked down upon his poor
bedraggled little shape they found no room
in their hearts for bitterness-only pity

bill nyes railway pass

a melancholy missive written by the great humorist when he returned
the precious pasteboard to the genial giver

from an old scrap book

hudson wis march  

wf white esq general agent atchi-
 son topeka and santa fe railroad
topeka kansas

dear sir-i enclose herewith annual pass no
q  for self and family over your justly celebrated
road for the year 

 i also return your photograph and letters you
 have written me during the past five years will
 you kindly return mine

 and so this brief and beautiful experience is to
 end and each of us must go his own way hereafter

 alas

 to you this may be easy but it brings a pang to


the railroad mans magazine

 my heart which your gentle letter of the st inst
 cannot wholly alleviate

  whenever hereafter you look upon this tear-
speckled pass will you not think of me remem-
ber that you have cast me from you and that i am
wandering across the bleak and wind-swept plains
sadly enumerating the ties on my way to eternity

  i do not say this to reproach you for i fear that
you care for another and so we could not be happy
again together	

  but oh do you pause to fully comprehend the
pang it costs me to return this pleasant-faced little
pass with its conditions on the back could you
see me even now as i write these lines turning
away ever and anon laying aside my trembling pen
to go and sit by the grate and shudder and weep and
put out the fire with my bitter tears your heart
would soften and you would say

   return o wanderer return	

  you do not say in your letter that i have been
false to you or that i have ever grown cold you
do not charge me with infidelity or failure to pro-
vide you simply say that it would be better for
each to go his several ways forgetting that my sev-
eral ways are passing away passing away

  it is well enough for you to talk about going your
several ways you have-every facility for doing so
but with me it is different several years ago a
large northwestern cyclone and myself tried to pass
each other on the same track when the wrecking-
crew found me i was in the crotch of a butternut-
tree with a broken leg since that time i have
walked with great difficulty and to go my several
ways has been a very serious matter with me

  but i do not want you to think that i am mur-
muring i accept my doom calmly yet with a
slight tinge of unavailing regret

  sometimes perhaps in the middle of the dark and
angry night when the cold blasts wail through the
telegraph wires and the crushing sleet rushes with
wild and impetuous fury against the windows of
your special car as you lie warmly ensconced in
your voluptuous berth and hear the pitiless winds
with hoarse and croupy moans chase each other
around the kansas haystacks or shriek wildly away
as they light out for their cheerless home in the bad
lands will you not think of me as i grope on
blindly through the keen and pitiless blasts stum-
bling over cattle-guards falling into culverts and
beating out my rare young brains against your
rough right-of-way will you not think of me i
do not ask much of you but i do ask this as we
separate forever

  as you whiz by me do not treat me with con-
tumely or throw crackers at me when i have turned
out to let your haughty old train go by i have
always spoken of you in the highest terms and i

hope you will do the same by me life is short at
the best and it is especially so for those who have
to walk walking has already shortened my life a
great deal and i wouldnt be surprised if the expo-
sure and bunions of the year  carried me off
leaving a gap in american literature that will look
like a new cellar

  should any one of your engineers or trackmen
find me frozen in a cut next winter when the grass
gets short and the nights get long will you kindly
ask them to report the brand to your auditor and
instruct him to allow my family what he thinks
would be right	

  i hate to write to you in this dejected manner but
you can not understand how heavy my heart is to-
day as i pen these lines

  i wish you and your beautiful road unmitigated
success it is a good road for i have passed over it
and enjoyed it how different the country will
look to me as i go bounding from tie to tie slowly
repeating to myself the trite remark once made by
the governor of north carolina to the executive of
south carolina

  i hope you may never know what it is to pull into
the quaint little- city of la junta with the dust of
many a mile upon you and the thirst of a long un-
eventful journey in your throat

  i hope that congress will not pass a law next
year which will make it a felony for a railroad man
to say  gosh  without a permit i hope that your
life will be chockful of hurrah and halleluiah even
if mine should be always bleak and joyless

  can i do your road any good either at home or
abroad can i be of service to you over your right-
of-way by collecting nuts bolts old iron or other
bric-a-brac 

  i would be glad to influence immigration or pull
weeds between the tracks if you would be willing to
regard me as an employee

  i will now take a last look at the fair young fea-
tures of your pass before sealing this letter how
sad to see an annual pass cut down in lifes young
morning ere one-fourth of its race has been run
how touching to part from it forever what a sad
year this has been so far earthquakes fires storms
railway disasters and death in every form have
visited our country and now like the biting blasts
from siberia or the nipping frosts from manitoba
comes the congressional cut-worm cutting off the
early crop of flowering annuals just as they had
budded to bloom into beauty and usefulness

  i will now close this sad letter to go over into the
vacant lot behind the high board fence where i
can sob in an unfettered way without shaking the
glass out of my casement

 locomotives while you wait

by arno dosch

  filling rush orders for locomotives is a problem with gigantic proportions
  that staggers the minds of those not acquainted with the workings of a huge
  locomotive plant and unfamiliar with the herculean undertakings evolved
  there to the average person whether the output of such a works is one loco-
  motive a day or only one a month is very much a matter of guesswork but
  when a firm like the american locomotive works can turn out four engines
  every day in theweek it helps to clear any existing uncertainty

       four locomotives a day  a month  a year-atlantic or pacific
  type passenger-engines as you choose moguls prairies and even a mallet with
  often less than thirty days elapsing in their evolution from mere billets of steel to
  proud speed-burning locomotives

       how do they do it mr dosch who has been delving into the mysteries of
  the great locomotive works describes the manner in which the work is ac-
  complished it is a story of brain and brawn of multitudinous details and
  brobdingnagian undertakings 

the huge locomotive works at schenectady new york where rush orders
for all types of steam engines are filled with the sim-
plicity of a well-equipped store

killets of iron and steel tremen-
dously heavy and giving an
overpowering sense of unlimited
strength lay in the dust at one
end of the schenectady shops of
the american locomotive works
at the other end they were becoming living
breathing monsters of the rail at the rate of
four a day

  it sounds big to see it is remarkable
and after you have followed the process
through you feel as if you had been present
while the earth gve birth to giants you

can talk about it only in circus-poster adjec-
tives

  i was there to find out how they set to
work when they are called upon to furnish
fifty locomotives in a hurry an order which
they were just now striving to fill a round-
house on an important railroad had been
burned and fifty locomotives were out of com-
mission the whole system had been tied up
and the general manager was a mile in the
air refusing to talk to anybody

  what was there for him to do he asked
he couldnt buy locomotives in a store




the railroad mans magazine

there wasnt a stock of them for him to go
and choose from nowhere was there a loco-
motive he could beg borrow or buy

a rush order

  aften ten minutes he got the american
locomotive works on the wire and asked
them what they could do to help him out of
the hole the answer came immediately

   if you are willing to take established
types you can have them in thirty days de-
livered four at a time until the order is filled
if necessary you can have them even faster
on that basis we can deliver you fifty or five
hundred

  in making that promise the sales-manager
was aware of the fact that the iron and steel
out of which some of those locomotives would
have to be built had not even been bought
but in an emergency he knew that they could
get the material somehow it might take some
scrambling but it could be done

  the order was even then being shoved
through the shops it called for half a dozen
widely divergent types from switch-engines
to a mallet articulated compound but as
regularly as clockwork four engines were
being shoved out into the world each day i
asked william dalton the chief consulting
engineer how this rush order could be filled
so readily

saving time

   half the work was already done before
the order came in he replied  they were
willing to take our standardized types and
saved two-thirds of the time as soon as the
order arrived it was possible to turn the work
in the shops directly over to it time is
consumed not only in the actual construction
of the engines but in planning them out on
paper if conditions on all railroads were
the same so that they could all use a limited
number of established models the manufac-
ture of locomotives would be as quick and
easy as the movement of one machine as it
is however every railroad has particular
conditions to meet and presents certain speci-
fications to meet these requirements an
engineering department of  men is neces-
sary we have filed away in our library
over  variations in the types of en-
gines

   sometimes the variations are small some-
times great but a locomotive is such a per-
fectly balanced structure that a change in
any part means the readjustment of the whole
locomotive our ordinary orders require

weeks of figuring before the work begins
and in some cases the plans for a locomotive
remain months in the- drafting-room be-
fore they are turned over to the shops when
c j mellin evolved the first big mallet that
was ever built he figured on it steadily for
five months before he was able to get the
proper adjustment

   when he had finished he had found a way
to distribute the weight evenly between the
forward and the rear drivers but when a
railroad orders mallets and asks for changes
here and there it is necessary to figure the
whole engine in its every part to bring that
weight distribution just right

  he led the way into a big room where
most of his staff were at work over desks
figuring sizes weight and strength

    those men he said  are all laying out
an engine each of the three hundred in
this room has a share in it and the thoughts
of all are constantly centered on the final
result

   outside in the shops you will find the
counterpart of each one of these men but it
will be a hammer machine or forge each
man in this room must make his part fit into
the whole to meet the exact requirements of
the engineer in charge of the work in the
same way the product of each hammer ma-
chine and forge must be exactly right when
it arrives at the assembling-floor where the
engines are put together

  in a hurry order this half of the work
has been done it probably took months of
figuring to arrive at the model used but it is
all on record to start the work it is only
necessary to send out the blue-prints to the
shop and the order-books to the purchasing
agents that is why we can make locomo-
tives while you wait

  but since this preliminary work is essen-
tial i stopped to learn how it was done be-
fore following the rush order in its rapid
progress through the shops

plans and specifications

  orders are all received through the new
york office and are forwarded immediately
to the engineering department at schenectady
which plans the work for the ten separate
shops operated by the company with each
order comes specifications made by the rail-
road and it is very seldom that two railroads
make the same demands three things de-
cide the size and form the grades on the
road the speed required and the weight of
trains the locomotives will have to haul
locomotives while you wait



  orders of any size are rarely- all for one
type of engine in an order for thirty loco-
motives there will probably be five or six
different styles and in the case of each as
far as the engineering departments labor is
concerned there is as much work as if each
style were a distinct order by itself

  each requires an entirely separate set of
figures roughly the chief points covered
are the weight of the engine the diameter of
the cylinders the stroke of the piston the size
of the wheels that can go with these specifi-
cations and the boiler capacity to furnish
steam for cylinders of that size

  each set of these figures must bear an ex-
act relation to all the others and no one of
them can be absolutely determined upon
from the start the only fixed considerations
are the physical features of the railroad for
which the engine is intended these cannot
be changed the grades must be coped with
and the railroad has determined on the size
of trains and the speed at which it expects
them to travel

  in making this nice adjustment and at
the same time getting all the power and speed
the railroad requires there is always the
danger of putting too great a weight on the
axles aside from this the eigineers always
succeed in meeting the specifications but to
do so requires a corps of high-priced con-
sulting engineers whenever an order comes
in requiring a variation in type dalton
their chief assigns to one of them the duty
of arriving at the desired end as best he can
this happened in the case of the first big
mallet referred to mellin who evolved it
is one of the consulting engineers and as
part of the days work he figured out the
engine that has revolutionized the hauling of
freight

diverse designs

  in this case the work happened to be par-
ticularly hard as there was an engineering
problem to be solved that had never been met
with before it required his constant atten-
tion and he figured out the whole engine
pactically by himself ordinarily his
duties are more general

  from his varied experience he knows
what style of engine is necessary to do cer-
tain work and the average order that comes
before him is usually but a variation of some
model that has become standardized it is
only necessary for him to establish the larger
proportions in a general way he has always
at hand a whole body of assistants ready to

seize upon the details and work them out
but as there must be a head he places in
charge an elevation man

  the general proportions he has established
bear about the same relation to the finished
locomotive as an artists model to the com-
pleted painting the elevation man
wields the brush he is the engineers paint-
ing arm he must know exactly what the
engineer is driving at and to have that in-
formation must be a first-rate engineer him-
self

  he draws a general outline of the engine
and then begins the intricate and delicate
task of building a locomotive on paper it
goes on in two directions at once and involves
all of the three hundred men in the room

figuring and refiguring

  on one side of the broad central aisle are
the draftsmen figuring on the parts decid-
ing on the necessary size of rods to meet the
strain the thickness of the boiler required
for a certain head of steam and all the thou-
sands of details each one of which must be
varied to meet the requirements of the whole
all the time they are working on these details
the calculating department is paralleling their
work comparing one part with another and
noting the necessary variations in the differ-
ent parts in order to arrive at the required
design

  during this process which may take a few
weeks or many months no one portion of
the engine is absolutely fixed as to size
and the temporary results arrived at by the
calculating department are being constantly
transmitted to the busy draftsmen who as
rapidly are forced to change their drawings
and figure over again the strain on the rods
the thickness of the boiler and all the other
details

  usually after each detail has been figured
again and again and the calculating depart-
ment has got down to a basis of estimate the
elevation man discovers that the nice balance
required has not been attained and it becomes
necessary again to alter the parts throughout
the whole engine

  in the mallet on account of the exact
distribution of weight necessary between the
forward and rear set of drivers this diffi-
culty is doubled but in any engine the weight
must be so evenly distributed that it will be
the same on all the drivers

  the process of figuring may be necessary
several times each new set of calculations
coming nearer to the requirements until


the railroad mans magazine

finally the exact size and weight for each
of the thousands of parts has been figured
down to the last degree then an expert
takes all the figures and verifies every detail

securing materials

  meanwhile if no attempt were being made
to push along the work weeks would be lost
in obtaining the material as it is long be-
fore the work has been turned over for the
scrutiny of the experts the material is under
way and by the time the blue-prints are
made from the drawings the- material is all
at hand so that the shops can begin work at
once

  getting things ready from the material side
demands constant attention from the start
as the work of figuring the size and weight
of parts begins to take form a pretty general
idea of the amount of material necessary can
be obtained

  in order to get the orders in as quickly as
possible there is an elaborate system which
moves forward day by day automatically it
involves the filling out of many forms and
the writing up of many books each of which
fills a definite part in the system and ad-
vances as of its own momentum this sys-
tem is far too elaborate to be more than out-
lined here

  some portions of the work take longer than
others and in order to get the greatest speed
work must be started on these first in other
portions there is difficulty in getting material
the steel mills are often slow in deliveries
or the brass foundries are far behind in their
orders the market for steel castings axles
or boiler-plate may vary from day to day
and the system must be constantly altered to
meet these outside conditions

  one date is always fixed-the day on
which delivery must begin it may be ninety
days sixty days or even thirty days or less
and all other dates must be figured with that
as a basis

the purchasing agent

  the men at work determining the size of
the parts have a certain date on which they
must have prepared the information for the
purchasing agent so that he can go out into
the market and buy what he needs delivery
from that point on depends on his ability to
get the material and as he is allowed only
enough time in which to make his purchases
that date is final as far as the engineering
office is concerned

  just to keep these orders up to date is a
whole system by itself but it is so simple that
the chief engineer can at any moment run
his finger down a column and tell exactly
what portion of all the vast amount of work
in the shop is behind time

  as long as the work is under his imme-
diate supervision he can keep it up to the
mark but the moment it gets beyond him he
has to contend with the inclination of all
things to go wrong not the least of which is
the tendency of cars to go astray ordinarily
enough time is allowed in the schedule for
the cars to arrive by the most devious and
roundabout way if they insist on being per-
verse but when there is a rush-order on
cars must come through on schedule

an army of inspectors

  to meet this emergency there is a large
body of men whose sole business is to climb
in with the material and conduct it person-
ally from the mills to the locomotive works
these material-chasers as they are called
have much the same duties as the super-
cargoes who used to be sent with cargoes of
merchandise on sea voyages

  as long as the cars keep on the move they
have nothing to do but the moment one is
side-tracked or shows an inclination to wan-
der from the prescribed path they set up a
howl that straightens things out in a jiffy

  in placing the orders the purchasing agent
sends with each an inspector to see that he
gets what is wanted in point of fact the
mills from which the concern buys are filled
with inspectors all the time orders follow
one another so rapidly that they never have a
chance to leave

  when the order leaves the mill it is as far
as the inspector can tell exactly according to
specificationsv but upon arrival at the shops
it must go through the hands of the testing
engineer he analyzes it chemically and
puts it to all sorts of tests and strains to see
that it is perfect then it is delivered at the
shops where it is worked over into the re-
quired parts

  the inspection does not even end there
but continues through every process even
those huge billets of steel and iron are ordered
in much larger sizes than necessary so they
can be sawed at the shops on the chance of
discovering possible flaws later i noticed
a small pile which had developed defects and
had been set aside to be shipped back to the
mill

the first half is now done the engine
locomotives while you wait



is built on paper and the material is at hand
for the actual construction it has taken the
constant intense efforts of five hundred men
but it is difficult to grasp the bigness of it
even after you have seen the backs bent over
desks and the minds strained in calculation
this is the point from which the work starts
when a rush order is received from now on
the magnitude of the task holds you fasci-
nated

  it lies before you like a panorama and
progresses with the rapidity of a moving-
picture film you go from shop to shop the
wonder of it growing on you until all at
once you are on the assembling-floor stand-
ing in a trance completely overwhelmed by
the work of creation that is going on before
your eyes while locomotive after locomotive
is built in all its naked strength

  in picturing the work my mind constantly
reverts to those billets of iron and steel i
feel as if i could not have understood the
size of the task if i had not seen them lying
there in the dust waiting to be given life

  first they are shoved into a white-hot fur-
nace then at the right moment steel hands
reach out and fling them under the steam-
hammers and the work of building an engine
is under way

  with a smash the hammers thunder down
tripping so fast that the sparks fly in a steady
shower they seem intent only on hitting
as hard as they can as they plunge wildly up
and down but behind thick masks close to
the red-hot metal stand some of the most
skilful and highest-paid men in the shops
watching the effect of the blows and direct-
ing the power behind the hammers with con-
summate skill and as the half-molten metal
is turned beneath the hammers they smash
or pat it as the occasion requires

  presently the steel begins to take form
with bends and curves here and there and
when the forgings are set aside to cool from
an angry red to black they have all the di-
mensions of size and shape indicated in the
blue-prints lying beside the hammers all
the- need now is to be planed smooth to take
their places in the frame that holds the boiler
solid to the axles

a weird spectacle

  across the way in another enormous shed
an even more spectacular process is under
way at first glance it is like one of the
scenes in theatrical pieces where the center
of the earth or the inhabitants of the moon
are produced with the exception that the

stage effects seem frauds while this looks
like the real thing

  through a dust that rises thick in the air
you can see earth-gnomes bending down over
molds into which molten metal is running
from some place far aloft like water out of a
hose under the strong light shining down
their bodies are distorted and dwarfed and
it is hard to believe that they are menjnaking
cast iron even later after the strange in-
fluence of the light on the dust has gone
when the castings arrive at the assembling-
floor they bring back vividly the picture of
their origin and seem hardly to have been
made by human hands

  all that was gigantic in those two sheds
becomes but a background however the
moment you step into the boiler-shed scat-
tered thickly over the whole extensive floor
surface lie hundreds of boilers in every stage
of construction from the solid sheets of steel
to the completed structures with the hoods
on tubes fitted and fire-boxes attached wait-
ing to receive their numberless fittings

in the boiler-shed

  the impression you get is that of a vast
collection of shells of some prehistoric lobster
bigger than a mammoth and that ruled the
land and sea if the billets of steel and iron
gave a sense of power derived from the earth
these huge boiler-shells increase it a hundred-
fold when you see the solid sheets of steel
bending unwillingly beneath the rollers you
get an undeniable impression of the life in-
herent in them which is only increased when
they have been bored full of holes that are
plugged with stout rivets through it all
is the deafening racket of the boiler-shop

  much of the less conspicuous work goes on
almost unappreciated by the visitor there
is so much of it that the mind cannot grasp
it all at once lathes cut constantly at one
surface tires are shrunk until they grip the
wheels in an everlasting hold smoothly work-
ing inconspicuous machines turned endlessly
on the lesser parts tenders and cabs appeared
as if by magic it was only among the steel
forgings that the bewilderment ceases

  here all those parts which must bear the
great strain are being made their number
is now much larger than it was a few years
ago in time they will practically supplant
all other forms of steel and iron with larger
engines and constantly increasing speed there
are now many parts made of forged steel
which were cast iron in the engines built only
a short time ago


the railroad mans magazine

  in the midst of all this work you see the
one thing you forget until your attention was
called to the little partitions at one side-the
local drawing-rooms in each are three or
four men constantly receiving orders from
the office of the chief engineer and inter-
preting the blue-prints to the pattern-makers
the molders the boiler-makers and the men
who are directing the countless machines
spelling out the orders in terms of steel

  among them move the inspectors the test-
ing engineers even inspectors in the employ
of the railroads for whom the work is being
done every part of every engine no matter
how great the hurry passes through the hands
of each of them whose duty it is to detect the
least imperfection and the slightest possible
flaw it makes no difference if it does cause
a delay nothing can pass their hands that is
not absolutely perfect

the assembling-floor

  at this point you begin to appreciate the
fact that you have been moving in a circle
and the product of each shop has been shoved
along toward a central point-the assembling-
floor in an hour you have caught up with
work that began two weeks before where you
did here on the assembling - floor the
boilers have found a solid seat in the saddle
between the cylinders the smoke-stacks are
being put in place as if the- were hats and
the work of connecting up the drivers with
all the many details that lay between the lever
and the piston progresses so rapidly that what
were mere skeletons a few days previously are
now ready to be sheathed and take the road

  the certainty with which each part finds
its place makes it appear as if the boilers
were great magnets that attracted what they
need fromthe surrounding shops until they
are completely outfitted with all their parts

  when the skeleton of the engine is yet un-
covered it gives an appearance of strength
it later disguises the very rivets studding
the boilers speak for the concentrated throb-
bing power about to be created within

  i was fortunate in seeing at this stage
several -pound mallets the biggest
locomotives the world has ever seen and
without their outer coverings they looked
several times as large as they really were
but even reducing them to their real pro-
portions it seemed as if there has never been
a road-bed constructed that could support
them

  they were in all conditions from the time
when the huge boiler-shells were being placed

on the trucks to that critical moment when
the monster first feels the breath of life of
all these stages the most impressive was to-
ward the end when the whole body of the
boiler was being swathed about with a white
heat-retaining compound preparatory to pla-
cing over it the sheathing that disguises its
crude strength

filling the bill

  a few final touches of paint a careful in-
spection of every joint and the trial engineer
was getting up steam in the one just com-
pleted slowly it began to throb with the
new life and carefully it was taken out and
put through its paces everything was in its
place every part true there was only one
serious danger-a hot box

  it was the fourth one that had gone out
that day and with each had gone a trial
engineer who remained with it until it had
entirely found itself in this case it was
going to help fill the rush-order but it might
have been going to chicago california peru
china argentina egypt persia or south
africa in any case the engineer would have
gone with it to teach it how to behave

  afterward when i saw other such engines
as those breathing heavily at stations or tear-
ing across the country with seventy-two solid
freight-cars behind their sleek sheathings no
longer hid their double-riveted boilers and
even the tread of the wheels only made me
conscious of the pressure behind the piston

  as i close this article the news reaches me
of a rush order for eighty-five locomotives
which has just been received by the baldwin
locomotive works philadelphia a powerful
competitor of the american locomotive
works with an equipment similar in every
detail to that of its rival this large engine-
building plant has been called upon to fur-
nish  worth of locomotives for the
harriman lines with deliveries to be made
during the months of october november and
december if the order is filled during the
time called for in the contracts and there
is every reason that it will e it means that
during the next six months the baldwin plant
will finish on an average a locomotive every
other day to be used over the divisions of the
harriman system

  the order is one of the largest on record
since the financial depression of -
and shows a tendency away from the policy
of retrenchment that it was feared that a
number of the railroads have been contem-
plating

chapter iii

put off the train

hese chronicles are not intend-
 hi ed to follow every detail of the
vllr exciting life-story that i shall
set frth herein i shall be
l content to relate only the most
graphic happenings-the most
blood-tingling and hair-raising that came to
me in my wild career as a wanderer

  on the day after my arrest in omaha as
red petes pal i was released by the police
judge he was willing to take my word that
i had never met my companion of the night
before until i awoke in that vermin-ridden
sleeping-house

  red pete for it was really he-a notori-
ous robber who had fallen into the clutches
of the police-very kindly offered the in-
formation that i was not in any way con-
nected with him and that he had no pals
whatsoever

  this evidently impressed the judge he
told me that i was free but he gave me
twenty-four hours in which to leave town

  i did not wait until the twenty-four hours
were up the first train that i could get
for the west i boarded it was not a freight
it was a passenger

i stowed away under a seat in a day

began in the july railroad mni

 coach and hid there successfully suffering
 more tortures than ever could have been
 meted out to any other man until the train
 stopped at a small town in western ne-
 braska

   a woman who had been sitting in the seat
 under which i was hiding dropped her bag
 as she was making ready to alight as she
 stooped to pick it up she spied me and
 set up the most frightful yell that ever i
 heard

   in a moment every other passenger in
the car came to her rescue they must have
thought that she was about to have a fit
for she seemed to be unable to utter a word

   heaven knows how i wish that it had been
 so but what she could not make up for in
 speech she accounted for in signs she
 pointed under the seat and-

   in a moment i was dragged out by rough
hands one passenger punched me in the
jaw-for what reason i do not know this
was a signal for the others to add to the
pummeling that i was in for and it seemed
that every other man that could crowd
around wanted to land on my jaw for good
measure

   i was so terribly cramped from my long
ride under the seat that i could not find
strength enough to punch back but i did
want to hit that fellow who hit me first

   i dont know what they would have done

to me if the conductor had not come along
at that moment

  he brushed some of the passengers aside
and asked me what i was doing i told him
the truth then he turned on the passengers
and said

   it would be a good thing to ask a man
who he is before doing him up in this man-
ner

  he had a kindly spirit he was human
he knew when a man was down he saw
by mj punched and bleeding face that i
had the worst of it and he was for teaching
those brutes a little lesson in human nature
there and then

   he lias told the truth he added

  the passengers began to move back
abashed

  where do you want to go asked the
conductor

   most anywhere i replied  i thought
that i would strike out for the west

  well im sorry he continued but i
must put you off here it is against the
rules you know

  no i did not know but somehow or other
i did not care

  he took me by the arm led me to the rear
platform and down onto the station by
this time the passengers had alighted and the
train evidently delayed by my discovery the
kind-hearted conductor waved a high-ball
and jumped aboard in another minute he
was out of sight

  there i was-left on the station of a
water-tank town it was evident that the
train did not stop there every day for the
place was thronged with a queer idle crowd
the populace had evidently come to the
depot when the train whistled that it was
going to stop

  when they saw the conductor politely de-
posit me in their midst they eyed me curi-
ously they were mostly farmers who had
driven into town there was a smattering
of cowboys and not a few women and chil-
dren

  one of the cowboys approached me i
must have been a sorrv-looking object one
of my eyes seemed to be closing and bulging
and it was mighty sore when i touched it
there were several places on my face and
neck that felt pretty raw and the blood was
trickling down my shirt

  a cowboy came up to me and the crowd
gathered around to hear what i had to say

  what happened cully he asked

    i was put off the train i replied  be-
cause i was stealing a ride

  i then noticed that one long lank in-
dividual in the bunch disappeared in a hurry
and started across the dusty pike

  what ye goin to do here asked a big
burly man with a heavy mustache

  his question was so foolish that i did
not answer i looked around to see if there
wasnt some water handy so that i could
bathe my face

  i moved around to the side of the little
station house when i noticed the long lank
man returning with a somewhat husky
black-bearded man who carried a short club
and wore a large star on his left breast

  my intuition-which had stood me in
such good stead all these years and which
seldom has failed me-told me that this man
was the police force of the place

  i was not wrong he came up to me like
a cyclone the crowd had gathered around
in such numbers that i was now hemmed in
and it was impossible to make any headway

   who are you   asked the bearded man
with the star

   who are you   i replied  i am a
stranger in this town i was put off the
train for not having a ticket i got badly
done up what are you   i asked again

  i marveled at my impertinence

   i am the county marshal he said and
without any further ceremony caught me by
the arm and dragged me off to the lock-up

  for the second time in my short career as
a free-born wanderer on the face of the
earth i was locked up just why i should
have been accorded such treatment i could
not understand but i was overjoyed when a
few hours later i was brought before the
town squire and released

  surely the judges have more to commend
them than the police

  this squire a young man evidently of
good breeding and education who i after-
ward learned owned a large ranch in the
vicinity asked the marshal why he had
arrested me

   he looked to me like a bum said that
worthy

  just because he had been put off a train
and was badly beaten he looked to you like
a bum it never occurred to you that this
man might be in pain and need assistance
did it if you had been in his place bleed-
ing and friendless in a strange town would
you have liked such treatment

  the county marshal looked then like a
whipped dog

   answer me  shouted the squire

  the marshal could make no answer he
the man who wasnt game



simply looked at me and walked out of the
court i was set free

  would that there were more men tempered
with such mercy as that young purveyor of
the law in that far western town should
he ever come across these lines he will know
who writes them

  i was at liberty again-as they say of the
prisoners who have served their terms i
walked out of the court and men came up to
me and congratulated me others sneered
and made remarks that dubbed me as an
unpopular candidate for further residence in
that town

  but i had one desire and that was to wait
and shake the hand of the man who had set
me free after such an ignominious arrest i
waited at what seemed to be the only en-
trance to the little court-house and soon was
rewarded by the appearance of the magis-
trate

  i walked up to him and held out my hand

  i want to thank you sir i said for
your kindness to me-for the justice of your
words

  he took my hand and shook it

  no one need be thanked for doing what
is right he replied  you seem to be in a
pretty bad way here go down to claw-
son and tell him that i said to fix you up for
the night

  he handed me a ten-dollar gold piece
then he bowed pleasantly and walked over
to his horse which he mounted with alacrity
and rode off

  i looked at the coin great scott but it
was welcome there was life in the old
land again

  clawsons was the only hotel in the vil-
lage-which i will name grinnell for obvi-
oureasons clawsons was to grinnell what
the main store post-office and saloon when
combined into one inharmonious whole are

lo	the average one-horse town it was the
waldorf-astoria of the place-it was also
the bowery retreat

  i made my way to its hospitable doors
and clawson himself met me he was lie-
hind the counter i guess some queer ones
had asked for lodgings in his time but per-
haps i gave him more cause for sudden
fright than anything that he had seen in
years

  he leaned over the ledger as i came to a
stop in front of him and before i had time
to utter a word he said

   youre the guy what was thrown ofl the
train this mornin aint you

  i nodded

  well he went on you dont get
nothin here

  squire oliver told me to come here i
said not without some feeling of resent-
ment  and told me to tell you to fix me up
squire oliver he drew back it was
evident that i had struck a vital spot but
he changed his facial expression and said
 that dont go down with me young
man any funny business around here and
i will have you up fore the squire to be sent
to jail

  squire oliver sent me here and if you
dont believe it ask him

  my ire was up  and if there is a law in
this state demanding that a hotel-keeper take
a man in when he has the money to pay ill
ask the squire to put it in force i an-
swered as i took the ten-dollar piece from
my pocket and rang it on the counter

  just then the county marshal ambled in
and noticed the argument he gave the
belligerent clawson the signal that it was
all right evidently for clawson turned the
register to me and i started to sign

   in advance he informed me before i
had time to write my name

  i passed over the gold coin he rung it
hard on the counter at its sound a red
grizzle-featured man who was sitting near
the stove looked up clawson took a key
attached to a huge brass disk from a board
over his safe and personally conducted me
to the top floor-the third-of his hostelry
down a long narrow hall at the end of which
he unlocked a door

  he took me into a small room and asked
me how long i intended to stay

   till the morning i replied not know-
ing how long i would stay

    all right he replied  i will send you
up your change in a few minutes

  he sent up nine dollars he had charged
me one dollar for that room for one night
that was going some and especially when
my capital was so very limited and uncer-
tain and still in view of the wishes of the
good young squire i could not have done
otherwise

  clawson had showed the way to a large
public bath at the end of the hall opposite
my room i was soon in there and in the
cooling welcome water great scott as i
look back now that bath felt so good that if
i had any adverse thoughts toward humanity
they were quickly dispelled

  the water did smart the chafed spots on
my face and neck but it eased my black and
swollen eye once clean i returned to my

room turned the key in the door and threw
myself on the bed for the first good sleep
i had known since i left my home

chapter iv

the night at clawsons

was suddenly awakened by a strange
sensation at my throat as i came to
my waking senses it dawned on me that i
was being throttled-a human hand was on
my throat and my head was being pushed
against the wall

  i opened mv eyes and they were blinded
by a sharp white light i struggled and
could see that it was night and save for the
sharp light that the attacking party tried to
blind me with there was no other light in
the room

  my assailant had a desperate grip on my
throat and he only used one hand but i
could feel that it was a very big hand for
i grasped it with my two in an effort to
release its clutch

  as soon as my assailant saw that i meant
fight he raised the lantern that he was hold-
ing and brought it down on my shoulders
he had aimed for my head but missed then
i began to realize that i was in a more
desperate corner than i had at first imagined

  he was evidently a burglar who had the
proper tools for the lamp was one of those
long round - shaped affairs that have an
electric attachment and throw a small pierc-
ing bulls-eye light as steadily as a ray of
the sun

  in the darkness i could feel my assail-
ant my hand now and then touched his
skin as i struggled to free myself it was
cold and clammy finally mine ran across
his face in an effort to get at his throat

  i managed to get a grip on his hair and
with more violence than i imagined i could
summon i threw him backward on the floor

  he went down heavily i groped about for
a light but before going to bed i had failed
to locate the matches it was daylight when
i had flopped on the bed now it was night

  who are you i shouted

  he made no answer

  presently i heard him fumbling he
seemed to be making for the door but in
that awful darkness it was impossible for
me to do anything the room was very
small and there was one window beside the
bed while the door was about three or four
feet from the foot

  i gathered my senses and said to myself

that it would be best to get into the hall and
make an outcry

  i made for the door but in the darkness
i stepped on the body of the intruder as i
stumbled forward he by some peculiar grip
on my wrist threw me to the floor i crashed
down bumping my head against the foot of
the bed

  in a moment he was up and had struck
a match as he did so i heard the click of
a revolver being cocked just as the match
flared up i saw the burglar standing over
me

   dont get up he said  or ill put a
load of this in you

  he stepped to a small table - the only
other article of furniture in the room besides
the bed-and lit a candle

  as its light filled the room i noticed the
red and grizzled features of the man who
was sitting by the stove when i paid claw-
son the money

  he was not typical of the west-not the
western man that i knew and was accus-
tomed to meet he was large and beefy
his face was particularly red andfreckled
and his hair was also red and somewhat
long he wore no mustache but his face
was covered with a stubble beard of the same
color as his hair

  where is that money he said come
be quick where is it

  what money do you mean i asked
you know and dont ask me any
questions the money that clawson handed
you this afternoon the nine dollars change
my fortune was going against that
muscular man armed with a six-shooter i
had no chance

  hand it over quick he shouted i
want to make my getaway 

  i dug into my pocket and took therefrom
the money-and handed it to him 

  he put it in his pocket and backed to-
ward the window

   dont you dare leave this place till day-
light if you do you will be killed there
is nothing for you to do but stay here 

  he went out of the window backward
it was evident that he entered by a ladder
i was not going to lose my coin so easily and
lie was not going to make his getaway with-
out some sort of a struggle

  just as his head disappeared below the
sill i blew out the candle and made for the
window

  i let out a cry that must have awakened
every man in grinnell for instantly there
was a crowd with lanterns and all manner
the man who wasnt game



of shooting-irons clawson came to the door
with a big lamp which shed a welcome light
on everything and after making what ex-
planation i could we went down to the
office which was now thronged with excited
cowboys and others

  in the midst of all stood my friend the
sheriff

  he was clad only in a suit of red under-
clothes he had gotten out of bed to be of
official service but he had not forgotten to
pin his- gleaming star on his shirt i won-
dered if he slept with it on in case of just
such an emergency

  being an officer of the law he was among
the first to be recognized finally he said
to clawson

   what has he done now  

  he says that he has been robbed re-
plied the hotel proprietor  i changed a
ten-dollar piece for him this morning in pay-
ment for a room and he claims that a man
broke in on him and robbed him

  the marshal was for disbelieving me i
could perceive that by the look that was com-
ing over his face i looked straight at him
and said

  youre going to tell me im a liar i
can see that in your face i dont care
whether you believe me or not you can go
around to the window and see the ladder
standing against it

  that dont go down with me he said
 i just think ill take you in as a suspicious
character squire oliver aint the only one
in this town and i guess we can prove
somethin

  hold on there marshal it was a sharp
clear voice-a voice that i had not heard
before the speaker had just entered and
he was somewhat fatigued it was evident
that he had been running fast

  what you got to say len said the
marshal addressing the newcomer

  i believe this man-and furthermore i
saw a fellow riding down the pike at a pret-
ty fast gait just a while ago he looked to
me like he was on your white mare i heard
the noise and i came up to see whats hap-
pened

  whoever len was his word evidently went
for something the marshal lost no time in
making his escape he rushed over to his
own home and in the early dawn which
was now just breaking he could see that his
white mare which usually had the run of a
small corral was missing

  i gave as good a description of the man
as i could and he was immediately recog-

nized by clawson then a posse was formed
and the bunch set out in the early morning
light to run down the robber

  they followed the road as far as the near-
est village-a distance of six miles-only to
find the marshals mare foam-flecked and
panting standing by the roadside nobody
in that village had heard anything of the
robbery or seen the man

  the only reason that could be given for
his escape was that he had arrived in time to
catch a freight that was just pulling out

  they brought the mare home and the
marshal was satisfied as to my innocence
but i could only think of the nine dollars
that had gone and wondered why fate had
willed to treat me so harshly

  clawson instead of turning me out on a
cold world gave me a job in his kitchen
 till something better turned up as he
put it

  i took the place gladly for i was strong
and willing but the work was of the filthi-
est nature imaginable it consisted largely
of cleaning all the utensils on the place
washing the dishes scrubbing the floors and
similar chores

  i was up every morning at five oclock and
at eight at night when the last bit of work
was done i was aching in every bone

  the hard couch in an outhouse back of
his ill-smelling kitchen on which he let me
sleep was oh so soft and welcome

  as i always determined to see anything
through to the end that i undertook i re-
solved to stick to this job until i had saved
enough to take me out of the town i had
always wanted to go to san francisco and
i learned that i could get a tourists ticket
to the california city for the sum of eighteen
dollars

  clawson was paying me the joyful wage
of three dollars a week and i figured that
if i held onto the job assiduously for a
period of three months i would save up
enough to buy the ticket to san francisco
and a new suit of store clothes so as to arrive
there looking somewhat respectable once i
struck that wonderful western metropolis
i thought i could get a start and make a
future

  t worked as carefully as a man knew how
i scrubbed the floors of clawsons hotel as
they had never been scrubbed before i
washed his dishes till the lye that i put in
the water ate into my hands and made them
sore he had no cause for complaint and
he complained not

  and each week i saved most every cent of


the railroad mans magazine

my hard-earned wages i took no chances
i put my money in the dollar savings-bank
of grinnell

  how pleased i was when the third month
passed and i found myself with sufficient
money to buy the ticket to san francisco

chapter v

shanghaied

the journey to san francisco was de-
void of any excitement i had put
up some cold meat and bread in an old cloth
which clawson kindly donated that is he
donated the cloth the food he sold me
and at the same price that he charged his
transient guests

  it would have been an easy matter to
have filched sufficient provender for the trip
from his larder but two things i absolutely
would not do i would not steal and i
would not lie

  i arrived in san francisco one morning
about five oclock a cold damp fog hung
ovei the city and we sat on the pier at the
oakland mole waiting for the first ferry to
start for san francisco i had never seen a
more forbidding sight it was before the
great quake so i must write of the city
by the golden gate as i knew it

  when i finally landed on the foot of its
most prominent thoroughfare i put my
hands in my pockets and thought of what
to do first

  i wandered up market street until i came
to a small coffee-house and went in as i
sat over a steaming cup of very good coffee
and a trio of the best doughnuts i had ever
eaten i took an account of my capital

  i found that i had just seven dollars and
eighty cents so it was  up to me  to find
work

  i was fairly presentable and it should be
an easy matter to get something to do the
man who waited on me and who was evi-
dently the proprietor of the place in re-
sponse to my question regarding a place to
put up at directed me to a boarding-house
near the shipping commonly known in san
francisco as  the water-front

  thither i went and after a short parley
of words with the landlord engaged a stuffy
ill-smelling room for two dollars a week-
paying him in advance at least i had a
place to lay my head at night

  when it seemed to be a reasonable hour
for the places of business to open i started
out in quest of work to relate the untiring

efforts on my part to find work and the re-
buffs and refusals on the part of the many
to whom i applied would only tell others
a story that they know too well

  i walked the streets of that big city for
three days and none would give me employ-
ment i asked for any position from a clerk
-for which i was ably fitted-to chore-boy
but there was nothing doing

  on the fourth day i managed to secure a
temporary place in a stable not far from the
lodging-house where i had my room the
stable-keeper wanted a man to arrive at his
place as early as five oclock every morning
and clean and harness the horses for the
various delivery wagons that were lodged in
his establishment

  the pay was small and the wrork hard
but it was a start and i would live inside
the income i was to receive four dollars a
week from him until i landed something
better that was my resolve

  i was making for my place of work the
second morning i had never felt so con-
tented i knew that the world was again
good to me-and i was confident that if i
did my work faithfully and kept sober i
would go ahead

  while engrossed in this dreaming a pow-
erful arm from behind slipped under my
chin and threw my head back

  a hand was clapped over my mouth and
a hoarse voice-commanded

  dont make any noise 

  it was still dark and it was impossible to
see around me

  there must have been two men at the
game for a pair of hands quickly manacled
mine behind my back and while my head
wasbeing held back and my eyes blinded a
sack was put over my head and tied tightly
about my waist

  then a handkerchief was tied over my
mouth indeed so tightly was it drawn that
it kept my mouth open and formed a gag

  a voice cautioned me not to speak i could
not have done so had i wanted to

  more quickly than it takes to tell it a man
caught me by either arm and i felt myself
being hustled along the street at a most un-
seemly gait twice i stumbled but my as-
sailants picked me up and pushed me along

   hurry him  i heard one of them say

 hurry hurry  they seemed to be in-
creasing their speed

  what new sort of attack was this i man-
aged to let whirl through my seething brain

  they hustled me along for a short dis-
tance i stopped once and let my feet drag
the man who wasnt game



but a sharp and stinging kick on my shin
told me that that sort of resistance would
not be tolerated

   they quickly pulled me onto my feet and
 i felt a kick or two administered to remind
 me that this was no time for fooling

   finally i felt myself being lowered into
 some place a rope was placed ardtmd my
 waist and i was let down a distance dragged
 a few feet-and my journey ended

   it all happened in such a short space of
 time that to tell it takes even twice as long

i became exhausted and sat down suddenly
a peculiar motion seemed to control every-
thing-a gentle motion as a swaying to and
fro it began to sicken me and besides the
place had a peculiar odor that was heavy
and oily

   i sat there wondering if i was being pre-
 cipitated to the bowels of the earth when i
 heard voices

    yes a good prize said some one

   then i felt the manacles that bound me
being loosened the gag was removed and i
could see

  i was in the hold of a ship-that was
plain as day

   i had been kidnaped-that was also evi-
dent but they do not call it by so juvenile
a term on the pacific coast i was being
shanghaied-carried away by force to serve
on shipboard

  three men stood over me one had a
cocked revolver

    a good husky lad said this one eying
 me  did you have much trouble landing
 liim 

  none said another he came easy
enough when we got the gag in

   i good work boys said the one holding
 the revolver  let him lie here till we get
 outside the heads make yourself comfort-
 able sonny well send you down some
 grub and water after a while

   they climbed up a little ladder pulled a
 covering over the compartment that i was in
 and left me there in the black darkness it
 was darker and blacker in that awful smell-
 ing place than i had ever imagined the
 vessel soon began to lurch and roll and my
 stomach could not stand it i became death-
 ly sick-so violently sick that i became

to be co

utterly helpless for once i asked the privi-
lege of dying

  i was conscious of one thing however
the place was infested with rats i could
hear them scampering over the board and
they squeaked so loudly that the sounds
made an almost uncanny vibration in the
darkness

  several times i am sure they ran over me
and touched my hands i was not too sick
to discern that

   i cried out i called to god to my mother
i cursed myself for ever having left home i
wondered just why one who really wanted to
do what was right should meet with so many
cruel misfortunes

   not long after that daylight entered again
and with it the three men who had visited
me earlier in the day

   come on deck said one

  i was really too sick to stir one of the
men came behind me and urged me to obey
with the toe of his boot i struggled to my
feet my head dizzy from the eternal motion
of the vessel and with the assistance of two
of the men i made my way up the ladder
along a narrow passage and onto the deck

  the fresh air did seem good-but i was
sick deathly sick desperate as those men
were they knew that i was unable to move-
that i would be unable to speak even until
the effects of the sea had passed away

    hes sicker n a dog said one

   drag him to the lee scuppers said an-
other  and let him stay there till hes all
right

  grab me they did they caught me by
the collar and fairly dragged me across the
deck then with their handy feet they
pushed my legs into a position to suit them

  there i lay - for how long i do not
know the hot sun burned into my brain
the sea seemed to be getting calmer i was
slowly getting my better senses i could
think more clearly but my legs were weak
and my muscles ached

  then the night breezes came up cool and
cooler i could hear the men going to and
fro and smell the odor of their evening meal
it had no attraction for me however i
wanted to sleep i closed my eyes wonder-
ing what awaited me on the morrow

of the railroads were distributed during that year	that go to stockholders and wall street indicated as

common carriers of this country	goes to make up the railroad mens pay-checks

   the huge railroad pie at the top of the page may	what the railroad men get represents a little

well be considered a toothsome morsel when the	over one-third of the whole pie but it may well be

reader stops to realize that it represents a total 	large for it is the share of the men whose hands

please explain the brown system of discipline
ds applied to railroads-a reader nevada

  this means discipline by record instead of being
actually administered in other words suspension
by record instead of actual suspension the record
is in the form of demerits and the system as a whole
is very similar to the form of discipline employed in
the public schools to simplify when a road
finally decides to inaugurate the brown system every
employee has his past offenses forgiven and every
employee affected by the system starts with what is
called a perfect record

  if a breach of rule should occur the offending
party after investigation is penalized with a num-
ber of demerit marks on his record equal to the
gravity of the case for instance leaving a termi-
nal without examining to note whether the tender-
tank contained water might result in five demerits
on the engineers record if a subsequent delay en-
sued running by a train standing at a station on
a double-track road might be punished by ten de-
merits and so on

  the brown system does not extend to shopmen
but includes practically every one in the train serv-
ice on the roads where it is employed as a rule
when the record contains fifty demerits the man is
warned and when one hundred demerits are in evi-
dence he is dismissed from the service the sys-
tem is also retroactive as every year with clean
records effaces so many demerits-say six or even
ten-and thus the incentive is afforded for a man to

wipe out previous bad marks by this elimination
process it is possible to return to a clear rec-
ord but it is not possible to return to a perfect
record as the latter is one which has never had a
mark set against it

  the brown system of which the above is the gen-
eral outline has been extensively employed by rail-
roads of this country the new haven uses it in
its full acceptance the erie in part and the santa
fe in part it has been found to be effective in
securing the ends of discipline more so in fact than
the former system of actual suspension in the lat-
ter a man could not wipe out a bad record but
this is thoroughly possible by two or three years
cautious work under the brown system

ae h brainerd minnesota-so far as we

	can learn there is no intention to change
either the name of the new york new haven and
hartford or the boston and maine no matter what
consolidation may be effected as you are probably
aware the general status of this entire matter is
imperfectly understood and we have not seen any
official statement issued by either company

what is the idea of an engineer having steam
on his engine while coming down about a
one-per-cent grade with a full line of
freight-cars behind him i have noticed particu-
larly that freight-trains in this country always ex-
haust the same as would take the engine up-hill




the railroad mans magazine

  	c p railroad passenger-engines have three
large wheels on each side but the connecting-rod or
rods are only connected to the two nearest wheels to
the cylinders the rear wheel is slightly smaller
than the others and runs free what is the idea

  	i have noticed engines on the c p montreal
line when steam is shut off it still escapes from
first one side and then the other with a noise like
cracking a whip please explain this also-a p
w toronto canada

  	running a freight-train is a fine arl and it
cannot be well explained from an editorial office as
there is always present some local condition in
which the engineer must take the initiative we
cannot say from here why in this instance he
should pull his train down a one-per-cent grade
as they will roll down plenty fast enough requiring
in fact very careful braking to hold them

  we shall endeavor to explain this question fully
in an article which we intend publishing in an early
number-the editor

  	your question suggests the atlantic or --
type having a four-wheel leading truck four con-
nected drivers and a trailing truck the latter being
the somewhat smaller pair of wheels to which you
refer the use of the trailing wheels is necessary
when the fire-box is widened -for additional grate
area and placed behind the driving-wheels the
trailing-wheels carry part of the weight of the en-
gine in that quarter and are generally designed to
have some side motion

  	this noise is occasioned by the escape from
the cylinder by pass valve this is one of two small
double-disk valves mounted in chambers bolted to a
steam-chest containing a piston-valve the larger
face of the by-pass valve is in communication with
the interior or steam cavity of the main piston-
valve while the smaller face is on the side toward
the cylinder if from any cause the pressure in the
cylinder should increase to a dangerous degree the
by-pass valve acts as a relief valve and opens com-
munication between the cylinder and the steam
chamber inside the main valve when running with
the throttle closed as your question suggests the
by-pass valves allow communication to be estab-
lished between both ends of the cylinder and the
interior cavity of the piston-valve equalizes the pres-
sure

any all-steel passenger-trains in operation

         	what is meant by the percentage of

  	they have none so far as we have been
advised

  	never heard of locomotive percentage

j

i a h wilmington delaware-we cannot re-

	call at this writing any publication devoted
exclusively to the consideration of steel cars whether
passenger or otherwise all the standard techni-
cal publications however devote ample space to
this subject when it warrants sufficient interest
the railroad age-gasette new york city can

always advise you on any point relating to this
construction if you will communicate with them

hm g williamsport pennsylvania-the late

	arrival of your query regarding the two
heavy mallet compounds which you recently noticed
prevents reply in this issue but we will have the in-
formation in the next number

what must be the proportions for a single-
riveted lap seam made of iron plates and
with iron rivets to get the maximum
strength-m b baltimore

  if the plates have a tensile strength and the
rivets a resistance to the shearing equal to fifty thou-
sand pounds per square inch the rivet holes not
the diameter of the rivets cold should be two and
a half times the thickness of the plates and the
pitch of the rivets from center to center should be
 times and the overlap of the plates  times their
thickness

   this is the very best rule of which we have ac-
knowledge and we are indebted for the same to
forneys  catechism of the locomotive which
although not revised for a long time is still a stand-
ard work for locomotive reference

fp fort bayard new mexico-the expense

	incidental to insulating iron box cars would
not be justified in fact the total cost of the car
would be raised to prohibitive figures all of the
experiments to which you refer have been made
long ago and very largely dropped as it was realized
that nothing was to be gained

can a telegraph sounder be worked on a tele-
graph line a ground-circuit line by l bridg-
ing in as in the instance of a telephone
withoyt cutting the wire between twto stations

  	about what per cent of telegraphers are
women 

   	do all railroads use the standard rules of the
american railway association especially the whis-
tle air-whistle and hand signals

   	can the air-brakes be applied on a passenger -
train aside from in the cab-l e garber mis-
souri

  	the ordinary sounder cannot be worked as
indicated and what is called a  main line  sounder
is required it might be possible to scrape the wire
and obtain clean points of contact by bridging but
much better results would be obtained by cutting
the line

   	there are no reliable statistics for this but
after looking into the matter from all angles we
are inclined to the opinion that not more than one
per cent represents the proportion at present it
appears from what information we can secure that
women have been gradually dropping out in this
profession during the past ten years

   	yes practically all of them

  	you will note the second cord in any pas-
by the light of the lantern



senger-car generally arranged lo run above the lop
window-frames and connecting with a valve placed
in one end of the car this valve surmounts a ver-
tical pipe which is connected with the brake-pipe
pulling the cord opens the valve and results in an
emergency application of the brakes provided the
valvefstield open

s

e monroe michigan-we regret that it is

	impossible to answer either of your interest-
ing questions in the form which they reached us
if you will advise in further detail regarding the
electric motor whether alternating or direct cur-
rent etc etc it will be quite easy to work it out
for you in full so far as the mallet articulated
compound which you mention is concerned it
should develop at least  horse-power under ideal
conditions

what is-tie approximate pay of each of the
following positions machinist roundhouse
foreman master mechanic and superin-
tendent of motive power-j w k taunton
massachusetts

  machinist from s cents an hour to  cents an
hour dependent on the section of the country and
the agreements in vogue between the machinists as-
sociations and the various railroad companies
roundhouse foremen receive from  to  per
month both this position and that of machinist
pay more west of the mississippi river the salary
of a master mechanic as a rule is about  per
month and it may reach  on some roads super-
intendents of motive power receive all the way from
 to  per year the position probably
runs a longer gamut in compensation than any
other in railroad service

jt

iat is the width of space that is required
between the tracks of a railroad i refer
to the space between the tracks of a two-
track system or a four-track system on the main
right-of-way-d e f new york city

  strictly speaking there is no universal standard
but the clearances generally used on trunk lines in
this country are  feet from center to center of
each track which with the standard -foot -inch
gage would imply  feet  inches for the space
between the tracks some railroads use  feet in-
stead of  feet but the latter will be found to apply
generally

what is armored brake-hose-b j b cleve-
land ohio

  this is brake-hose covered with a vvoven-wire
fabric to protect it from injury another form of
armored brake-hose is formed by winding a con-
tinuous wire spirally around it by a machine which
makes the spiral slightly smaller than the tube so
that it grips lightly vacuum brake-hose for
vacuum brakes is usually lined with coiled wires on

the inside to prevent collapsing but this is not prop-
erly termed armored brake-hose

vt

what is a radial stay 

 what is a stay-bolt

        	please give the accepted definition for
steam-w s baltimore

   	in many boilers the crown-sheet of the fire-
box is supported by a number of rods or stays pass-
ing through the outside of the fire-box and secured
by nuts these stays are set radially to the curva-
ture of the crown-sheet hence the name

  	a bolt with both ends threaded used for
staying the  inner and outer plates of a fire-box
the ordinary stay-bolt is screwed through both
plates and its projecting ends are hammered or
riveted over the plates flexible stay-bolts are used
to afford some elasticity between the inner and outer
fire-box sheets whose different rates or degrees of
expansion cause numerous breakages of stay-bolts
hollow stay-bolts are used for admitting air above
the fire it is usual to drill a one-eighth-inch hole
to a depth of about three-quarters of an inch in the
outer ends of stay-bolts in order to more easily dis-
cover a broken stay-bolt by the escape of steam and
water

  	steam is the vapor of water formed by its
ebullition when heat is imparted to it the tem-
perature of ebullition or at which water boils de-
pends upon the pressure to which it is subjected
at atmospheric pressure the boiling temperature is
 fahrenheit at  pounds per square inch it is
 degrees and at  pounds  degrees the
formation of steam in a locomotive boiler is a phys-
ical change caused by the application of heat but
there also occurs a chemical change due to the same
cause which results in precipitating the mineral
salts held in solution in the water when it entered
thejxiiler and forming a hard crust or scale on the
plates and tubes this scale is a bad conductor of
heat and when it forms on a plate to a thickness
of one-eighth of an inch more coal must be burned
to transmit the same amount of heat to the water
than before the scale formed and the fire-box espe-
cially the crown-sheet is overheated to a dangerous
extent

does the forward truck of an engine swing
laterally and does it follow a curve or do
the inside wheels slip in the same manner as
a driving-wheel

   	is there any patent on a device to make the
headlight follow the track on a curve would
such a device be of any value provided it was a suc-
cess-w k stillwater minnesota

   cl -with the exception of a few designs of rigid
trailing trucks all engine trucks are made to turn
about a central pivot or to allow for side displace-
ment to enable the locomotive to round sharp curves
in regard to the lateral motion this is provided for
in what is called the engine truck-swing bolster
which is a bolster from which the center plate of the
truck is swung or suspended by means of short links
hung on pivots or pins it enables the truck to


the railroad mans magazine

oscillale transversely to the center line of the engine
and thereby more readily adapt itself to the track
when running on uneven or curved track engine
trucks take curves readily in view of their very short
rigid wheel-base there is no  slip  to the wheels of
either side so far as we have observed

   	no doubt there are patents covering this be-
cause it has been much talked about as a possible
improvement such a thing however would be of
little practical value the view through a curve is
generally broken by the walls of a cut or objects
along either side of the permanent way and over
such obstacles a swing headlight would be unavail-
ing

sd vineland new jersey-an eye test is now
 generally a requisite for men entering the em-
ploy of railroads as telegraph operators therefore
we cannot quote any road where it is not practised
please read our reply to  f a c page  june
number which fully answers your query in regard
to the working hours for operators under the hours
of service act

mr j allegheny pennsylvania-you had
 best dismiss all idea of ever securing the
position of division master mechanic without pre-
vious experience in the subordinate grades we
fully appreciate that this advice is discouraging after
you have completed a college course with that spe-
cific end in view but there is really nothing for you
to do but enter the mechanical department of the
road of your choice in some subordinate position
the fact that you are a technical man would no
doubt help considerably in securing promotion but
the main thing to learn is how to handle men and
this can only be learned in the school of practical
experience

vt

jm k new london connecticut-the outer

	side or rail of a curve is raised so as to carry
the center of gravity of the moving object inward and
thus in a measure counteract the impulse to follow
the line of least resistance-a straight line raising
the outside rail counteracts the thrust or push of
the thing in motion converting it from a shearing
force into a downward pressure and does away with
the tendency in railroad engines to either ride over
the outside rail turn over the rail itself break it or
shear the spikes at the ties and push the rail from
its position

wh s benson illinois-we can add noth-

	ing to what has often been said in tjiese
columns in regard to the merits or demerits of any
correspondence school because we have no intimate
knowledge of the workings of any of them we
know however that they all include a thorough drill
in the theory of the railroad this is of unques-
tioned value as the time has now arrived in rail-
roading when a man is supposed to know something
of what the business is based on your height and
weight are about right for a brakeman but your age

twenty-seven years might possibly be objected to
you can readily find out however by applying to
any railroad in your immediate vicinity as there is
little variation now in requirements all over the
country

what is the quickest and surest method of
figuring the horse-power of an engine and a
boiler-r r p marfa texas

   the general formula for ascertaining the horse-
power of a locomotive is as follows

           p x l x a x n

---h p

                   

  in which

   p means effective pressure in pounds per square
inch  per cent of boiler pressure

   l length of stroke in feet

   a area of piston in square inches

  n number of strokes four times the number of
revolutions per minute

   h p indicated horse-power

   there is another  rule of thumb  that works out
pretty well in stationary engine practise but we
would scarcely recommend its employment save in
the roughest calculation viz  square the diameter
of the cylinder and divide by four it is astonish-
ing the closeness of the result so attained with that
from the more elaborate and accurate formula given
above a similar rough-and-ready rule for arriving
at some conclusion regarding the horse-power of a
boiler is to allow  square feet of the total heating
surface per horse-power

i g new york city-the tunnel portion of
v the pennsylvania railroads improvements
in new york is under the hudson river the city of
new york manhattan and under the east
river to long island between six and seven miles

  	the pennsylvania is double-tracked be-
tween philadelphia and washington district of
columbia and in many places where congested con-
ditions warrant it is a four-track road the latter
practically prevails over the entire distance from
new york to philadelphia

  	comparisons between the train performance
of railroads are generally unfair through the ina-
bility to secure full data hence we hesitate to make
any comment on the performance of either eighteen-
hour train the pennsylvania trains running daily
between jersey city and chicago in is hours make
the s miles at the sustained average speed of 
miles per hour and they were on time at destination
during the year ending june    times out
of  or  per cent of the trips of the year west-
bound and  per cent of the trips east-bound
of the  late arrivals at chicago  were not over
 minutes late

  the new york central reported for its trains a
somewhat less fa vocable record but the centrals
fast trains travel at a higher speed the distance be-
ing greater and the trains are often made up of
five six or seven cars for a part of the distance

to his raising a practical railroad man sir
a man with a sound scientific education both
in theory and practise sir

worry and dont go enticing the kid off
fishing and make him neglect his work
either if you do -he tried to look fierce-
 ill land on you

  i noticed among other things that he
wore a genuine alligator belt and ashirt
striped up and down in six audible colors
that he had buckles on his shoes as big as a

out here everything goes with us archie
my son- which was as far as he ever
did get

  archie my son opened his cylinder-cocks

coils sensitive instruments so finely adjust-
ed some of them that they had to be kept in
a vacuum-all junk men have died igno-
bly for lesser insults than that in this west-
ern country

  honk sat stunned and speechless while
sisterate and conversed he praised the
cooking and mentioned that his digestion
was perfect he related the history of his
young life and quoted statistics exhaustive
and intimate gleaned from the annals of
athletics beginning with the ancient heroes
of the prize-ring and ending with racing
aeroplanes for sweepstakes he had the
data right on tap

  football and baseball thrilled the harp-
strings of sisters soul when he wandered
verbally into that field his eyes glistened
with the moist glisten of the soul-rapt he
was a devotee when i agreed with him
that the man who knocked a high drive over
the right-fielders head when the bases were
full was greater than he that taketh a city
he chose me for his chum

   what we want to do right away now


the railroad mans magazine

he said  is toget busy and organize a team
ill pitch you can play short lengthy
here can hold down the initial pillow sa-ay
we wont need no outfield ill fan em just
as fast as they come to bat man i eat em
thats all chirk up old glumsy why so
sober you aint broke is you 

  this last to honk who was looking both
gained and fatigued

  the time passed jerkily that tuesday
sister led the conversation at a long gallop
taking the hurdles with ease he was a
steeplechaser with words railroading en-
gineering mechanics or the discussion of
arts and sciences the sordid pursuits of men
in winning the world from savagery he
vaulted lightly or side-stepped

  on the other hand the thought of turning
valhalla into one long athletic tournament
caused him to sound the view-halloo sister
was the original olympian gamester

  honk appointed me a committee of one
toshow sister around we went out to the
power - house first while there we signed
butch poteet for third base

  at the water-works pumping-station we 
took on two fielders and a catcher the re-
mainder of the requisite quota with six for
extra emergencies were acquired here and
there-at the cement-mill from the street-
cleaning corps the mercantile establish-
ments and the city hall

  ere twilight stole shadowy and athrill
with bug-music across the far - stretching
sweep of the plains he knew many many
citizens by their front names all the streets
had selected the site for the ball park
matched one of the stokers at the power-
house against a brick-molder for a ten-
round bout for points at an early date and
had aroused public sentiment to such an
extent that they were circulating a petition
to buy suits for the ball team

 we returned to the medicine-house sister
effervescing and yours truly a bit fagged
considering that he had the task of getting
supper staring him in the face but showing
strong and sound of wind

  honk heard our reports of progress with-
out comment he couldnt have inserted a
word anyhow into sisters solid stream of
talk without the use of a hypodermic

  once while our garrulous visitor was
wetting his dry pipes with a drink of ordi-
nary water honk slipped in a remark deftly

   well rise early to-morrow and get our
young friend lined up at his work he said

  whats that asked sister work
what kind o work 

   i thought you could carry a chain for
me said honk mildly  im going to
survey a plat in the west end

   wont have time to-morrow said sis-
ter  ive got to get the team under prac-
tise fatty here can help you out maybe
every day put in in practise now is that
much to the good to-morrowll be my busy
day i do reckon we got to get in shape
now in short order if we expect to make a
showing

  honk got out his letter from manning
senior and reread it carefully he looked
as if he harbored suspicions of having over-
looked a bet or two afterward he made a
pencil notation-it was useless to attempt
an audible comment while sister was in
eruption--and slipped the document to me
to peruse i went out and read the same
under an arc-light

   a bum steer honk had annotated
the letter went on to state in the sparkling
breezy style of a stock-riiarket report that
the consignment submitted was sound staple
and unadulterated if unripe it would mel-
low readily in time it was first-class ma-
terial all it needed was a few skilful
whacks with the chisel when lo

  there youd have a masterpiece it was
a chip-off the original chunk as it were
manning senior took occasion to fling a
few bouquets on his own lawn in passing
i suppose for the benefit of the fair one who
took the notes  m b was her initials
down in the corner

  i agreed with honk it was a bum steer
sister was raw material all right and of
standard brand but as a delver and digger
among delvers and diggers i feared that he
might quarrel with his tools work sis-
ter alas and ahum it was even as he
had said-he was too busy

  honk and i seized  an opportunity next
morning while sister was unpacking his
bats and balls catching-gloves and other ac-
couterments to confer about it

   why that old rummy told me that his
kid was a regular greedy worm after knowl-
edge that he made a hobby of mechanical
and engineering subjects fie said the young
ruffian set him back a tidy sum every month
for midnight gas consumed while studying
books on electricity steam-power and kin-
dred things

   ptt he was reading the sporting news
i bet you why that young barbarian dont
know a pin-valve from a monkey-wrench
make an all-round railroader out of him
ugh
sister



   hes only about nineteen i said
 just out of the top-spinning class what
do you want for a nickel 

   well let him go back and put up his
ping-pong court and his tiddly-wink table
at his pas then i dont want him around
here bothering he talks too much with his
mouth honk returned with gloomy pes-
simism

  so honk washed his hands of sister but
sister didnt pine away for all that no

 sometimes for hours this revel lasted
 honk began to wear a hunted look inas-
 much as the phonograph couldnt drown sis-
 ter out

 so he wired manning pere 

    your son spends his time playing ball and
 evading work instruct

 the old gent replied

 wont hurt him a bit he studies too hard
 anyhow glad hes taking a little relaxation

the old medicine-house had all the ear-
marks and outward semblance of a
hospital for the violently
unhinged

z

sir he gathered together his ball team and
practised them early and late from red
dawn till hen - roost time they clouted the
leathern sphere ran whooped made double
triple and even quadruple plays stole bases
and developed team work until the far hills
reverberated with their din

  sister showed up three times a day puff-
ing and sweat-streaked long enough to throw
in a few scoops full of sustenance then he
was off again gone again

  when he had a few minutes to spare he
organized a track team a basket-ball league
and arranged a swimming contest in the res-
ervoir evenings he regaled us with the
wild mad bewildering story of it all

  sister tore out one morning and caught
the motor-car for millardsville by a hundred-
yard sprint just after it pulled out and
valhalla seemed like a dream till afternoon

  at three-thirty however he returned to us
all safe and sound and announced that he
had matched a game with the millardsville
aggregation of swatters to be played on the
valhalla diamond saturday afternoon by
the grace of a benign providence and a
republican form of government for a purse
of one hundred dollars winner takes all
world without end sa-ay mister and what
do you think of that

  he got to rehearsing different varieties of
college yells and singing topical songs at the


the railroad mans magazine

top of his voice after supper until the old
medicine-house had all the earmarks and
outward semblance of a hospital for the vio-
lently unhinged honk finally fled wildly
into the night nor returned until morning
i think he slept out in some remote spot
where he could hear himself think

  i saw him for a brief period friday the
day before the big game he had an ex-
pression of gloom about him

   horace he muttered brokenly  im
taking a little trip south to look over the
sugar-beet prospects expect to be away sev-
eral days if-i mention it incidentally-
if anything should happen to this loud-
mouthed young chum of yours if he rup-
tures a blood-vessel while attacking some
worlds record or gets himself drowned or
electrocuted or blows up you may reach me
by heliograph about nine any evening not
that i apprehend any such good fortune
but i would like to know it if it should
occur

  what not staying for the game  i
asked

   nup he said  let chaos reign with-
out me i have already strangled on my cup
of joy and blew a bean up my nose figura-
tively

  he borrowed my bicycle and what tobacco
i happened to have and pedaled moodily
away

  saturday came cloudless and big with
portent likewise came the millardsville
team and two hundred rooters profligate of
noise and raucous it was a stubborn strug-
gle the millardsvillians had it in for val-
halla

  i couldnt say that i had noticed it before
but it appeared very clearly then that they
were frantically jealous of our progress
valhalla had outstripped them in the race for
supremacy and it stuck in their crops they
came over to belch up the venom of their
disgruntledness as the poet says

  well valhalla turned out freely to see the
sacrifice of our neighbors ill say that the
mayor declared a half-holiday and pitched
the first ball himself

  before proceeding further i may remark
that the particular swatter at the bat at that
juncture knocked that first ball high and far
and made a home run on it whereupon two
hundred odd voices rose in a clamor of
whoops jeers and ribald laughter

  sister pitched the rest of the game be-
sides that he coached at other and sundry
times he wrangled with the umpire certain
members of the opposing team and being

captain of the home outfit sassed his own
men mercilessly when things went wrong
things went wrong in disastrous succession 

  the millardsvillians busted the highly
elaborated curves of sister smack in the face
and knocked them in all directions it was
singles two - baggers home - scampers and
then gr-r-r-wow whee whoopee i
never saw a more persistent and irritating set
of yellers in my life

  valhalla got to bat after an interminable
time and lasted until three men could fan
wow wow it was  to   to   to 

 to   to -valhalla holding her own
nobly sisters team started without a score
and never went back of that

  nine delirious innings were played and
never once did a valhalla wigwagger get
to first butch poteet came the nearest but
he stubbed his toe and fell so they put it on
him before he got untangled sister got so
wild at the last that the catcher couldnt
reach his balls with a pole he lost his
temper made overtures to fight his baiters
frothed at the mouth grew hectic with rage
and had other symptoms of disintegration
all of which was greeted with  whoop 
whoopee wow

   whats he goin to do now  look at
that one roll it across whoever told him
he could pitch  oh mama  and other
compliments

  the visitors lambasted the ball into the
outfield and chased in five runs during the
ninth struck out the requisite number of
valhallas dispirited unfortunates to put
them out of business and the slaughter was
finished with a total score of twenty-eight
to what the goose hides in the hedge-row

  pandemonium came down off her perch
accompanied by all her riotous cohorts and
the ear-splitting uproar that resulted would
have awakened the inmates of an asylum for
the deaf and dumb they not only smeared
on the smartweed but they insisted on rub-
bing it in of course the valhalla backing
felt somewhat awearied especially those who
had put up the exchequer

  i knew the weather indications gather-
ing clouds ominous calm ruffled by inter-
mittent gusts a hurricane was brewing

  though i deeply admire a -fight-if i 
have a good seat well removed from behind
a post and the film is clear and properly
shown-i argued it over mentally and de-
cided to tear myself away getting whanged
over the coconut with a ball bat looks funny
but it jars on the man that furnishes the
coconut
sister



  well they got into it all right just as i
expected i found that i could see and en-
joy it far more perfectly from the roof of the
medicine-house aided by honks binoculars
than if present at the actual seat of the
struggle there were several rounds with
all the way from one to ten engaged nothing
studied or scientific about it just loud re-
crimination blows clinching kicking biting
butting and gouging

  it was the primitive struggle of the young
animal in which the sharpest teeth and the
longest claws prevailed millardsville being
the least removed from savagery whipped of
course

  those farmers fought like they flailed the
golden grain or cleared the forests-by main
strength and awkwardness all differences
that admitted of settlement by bloodying
noses and blacking eyes being adjusted the
tide of battle ebbed and the rabble friend
and foe alike turned its attention to sister

  perhaps he lacked that consummate tact
and aplomb that comes with age and ex-
perience maybe he
failed to say his say
in the right tone of
voice which the occa-
sion demanded any-
way the outfit mobbed
sister finally

  they mopped up the
ball-grounds with him
they rough-housed him
with horny ruthless
hands tore his new
ball - clothes scratched
mystic symbols on his
face with finger - nails
that had never been
properly sterilized and
clawed out snatches of
his hair for souvenirs
besides bruising and
pummeling him some-
thing scandalous to
see

   i was on sisters side
throughout never de-
serted him for a min-
ute others more in-
different to his fate
and less intrepid of
spirit might have
climbed down off that
car-roof and dismissed
the whole affair with
a snap of their fingers
but not me

  i watched until theyd pounded sister into
a pulp i never backed down an inch till
it got too dark to see

  sister limped in soon after sundown he
was contused and battered beyond recogni-
tion but unquenched of soul and filled with
a malignity worth paying admission to see
he held a four - hour autopsy with some
stunts in diagnosis vivisection post-mortem
examination and free clinic intermingled

   you saw how i put em over fatty
you know that catcher we had couldnt
catch a cold and them decisions of that
umpire waugh fatty waugh why
-and then about sixty-five of them pitched
onto me

    id have licked every one of em too if
theydve come one at a time as it was
they didnt put nothing on me i guess not

    sa-ay this is the star town for howlers
this is a yellow - dog settlement for true
cant play ball cant play nothing why-
ugh aint you got no kind of liniment
no court - plaster either lookee here
where i skinned my
knuckles on some
micks mug gee this
town gives me a pain
i wouldnt live here
if youd deed me the
whole bloomin grave-
yard why this town is
dead and dont know
it take it away
four hours of that
by the cuckoo - clock
clacked sister didnt
annoy me though i
slept through at least
half of it when it
came my regular bed-
time i roused up and-
found him packing his
steamer trunk

   dont be rushed
off i said yawning

   lor lumrae  he
said  i aint ive
stayed a terrible sight
longer now in this
dump than any-
bodydve thought i
would why man
sa-ay would you
think id waste very
many minutes in this
gone-to-seed noisome
putrid and sickening
hole 

i was on sisters side throughout


the railroad mans magazine

   well i dont think i should hope not
the only reason i aint on my way fatty
is because tiiere aint nothing moving youre
all right you and granddaddy longlegs i

how cheerful wouldnt that start your
nose to bleeding from sheer joy 

a letter we received after an interval from
sisters indulgent father came very near

aint saying anything against you but
youre easy to please if you stay in this
seed-wart of a town

   yes i agreed sleepily  youre right
this town wouldnt suit you for a perma-
nent home and i bade him good night

  sister and his luggage passed outward and
onward from valhalla while the forenoon
following was yet young and no pensive
band of admirers saw him off

  he had come like a comet out of the void
tarried in our midst briefly and with some
display now he was receding slightly dis-
figured but possibly not permanently
squelched oh no he would probably
break out in a new place like a pimple
thats had a backset

  that night i heliographed honk to come
back from the beet-fields the canary had
squeezed through the wires and flown he
came on foot trundling the bike which had
suffered a punctured tire as usual

  no disturbing shadow marred the peaceful
serenity of his smiling countenance however

  is he gone for good he grinned

causing a couple of heart-failures though
and thats a fact if i ever stated one

   i take this opportunity of thanking you
for what you did for the boy the old gent
had dictated to  m b again  while he
was but a short time with you his genius
seemed to need just that slight impetus the
boy inherits his talent of course but he
seemed to need the stimulating influence of
a mechanical environment such as he found
with you how is that for a neat way of
putting it eh

   to return to the subject my son has
devoted himself very assiduously to his ex-
perimenting and i have the pleasure of an-
nouncing that he has perfected and to-day
received his letters patent to an invention for
which the world has been waiting breath-
lessly i refer to no less a marvel than the
wireless telephone-perfect practicable and
complete-

  air air tried honk at that point
in the letter  gimme air where am
i and all that night he tumbled
wheezed and muttered in his sleep

dont shoot the paymaster hes doing his best-the grouchesof a ham

and them decisions of that umpire 
the greatest battle-ship in
the world

by arthur b reeve

in the building of a great battle-ship there are many points of parallel interest
to railroad men with the construction of a locomotive both are the crown-
ing features of the use of iron and steel as applied to motive force on land
and on sea respectively both typify in their respective spheres mans utmost
in speed and power essentially also their destinies are linked together the
one guaranteeing the safety of the mighty commerce built up by the other and
at the same time dependent on that commerce to originate the wealth that ren-
ders its own existence possible

the florida and a hundred articulated compound engines compared how
the mighty commerce protector compares with the
commerce creator

gether would make a pretty respectable pas-
senger-train

  ail average engine carries from twelve to
fifteen tons of fuel the coal to fill the
bunkers of this leviathan would be sufficient
for considerably over a hundred locomotives
it would require fifty gondolas loaded to
their full capacity of  pounds to
transport it besides that this ship will carry
four hundred tons of fuel oil which is about
thirty-five times that carried by the largest
oil-burning locomotive no  which
carries  gallons

  all the new vessels in the navy now have
provision for storing oil and in the future
it will be used extensively in emergency
the oil can be sprayed over the burning coal
but under ordinary circumstances the two
forms of fuel can be used interchangeably
as dictated by supply under full steam
the coal consumption will be over eighteen
tons an hour

  just to keep this great machine going for
an ordinary piping year of peace will re-
quire an expenditure that would suffice to
purchase sixty moguls or close to a million

i

fmagine a monster as heavy as a
hundred and two of the famous
southern pacific mallet com-
pounds-no  which holds
the record as the heaviest loco-
motive in the world let this
monster be nearly as long as eight mallets
as wide as ten as deep as three as costly as
two hundred and twenty-and then sup-
pose it floats

  there you have our great battle-ship flor-
ida which was recently launched at the
brooklyn navy-yard where she was built
the latest word in war-ships which for a
time at least will be the most powerful
fighting machine afloat on all the oseven seas
literally a mxr-super-dreadnought just to
get some idea of what she is here are a few
simple comparisons which will appeal to any
railroad man

  a railroad engine carries one engineer and
one fireman here is a great war engine
which will carry thirty or more altogether
her complement will include officers enough
to nearly fill two chair-cars and the crew
would fill fourteen day-coaches which alto-


the railroad mans magazine

dollars her coal alone will cost over a
dollar a second while she is running

  a broadside fired by the florida will be
nearly half the weight of a steel car and
will cost more than a pacific type passenger
engine with a couple of box cars thrown in
incidentally to average things up to be
more exact a single broadside will weigh
nearly  pounds and will cost over


  each of the big twelve-inch guns weighs
almost as much as a pullman and is almost
as long-fifty tons and fifty feet these
guns will throw a projectile weighing about
half a ton twelve miles with an elevation of
twelve degrees the highest on shipboard

  the muzzle velocity of such a projectile
is  feet a second one of the highest
speeds for a railroad train recorded for a
distance is given in the world almanac as
 miles an hour two miles a minute the
speed of the projectile is thirteen times as
great as that

  when such a weight traveling at such a
speed strikes something in range things are
likely to happen in fact such a projectile
will pierce fourteen inches of krupp steel
at  yards which is the equivalent of
forty-two inches of wrought iron

  one such projectile costs over five hundred
dollars torpedoes are five times as ex-
pensive and the smaller guns which can
throw hundred-pound shells at the rate of
fifteen a minute cost in proportion to sum
it all up the florida can throw twenty-five
per cent more than any other ship afloat in a
given time-she is a navy in herself

  yet they are not satisfied with making
even twelve-inch guns great britain is
building thirteen and one-lialf inch rifles
and we are experimenting with rifles of
fourteen inches

the floridas vitals

  tucked away down in the hold protected
on every side by the toughest armor made
are the boilers of the babcock  wilcox
type feeding ten four-screw parsons tur-
bines each turbine having over 
blades the engines of the florida are con-
structed to develop at least  horse-
power

  one of the erie mallet compounds worked
to its full capacity will haul  loaded
cars of fifty tons each on a level track at
fifteen miles an hour it would then be
exerting  liorse-power the horse-power
developed by the engines of the florida will

  be equal at the very least to seven of these
mallets

  if it were similarly applied to hauling
loaded cars as indicated above the train
would be twelve and a quarter miles long
as the north dakota the next largest new
ship to the florida really developed 
horse-power or over  more than was
the minimum requirement it is confidently
hoped that the florida when she makes her
trial trips will do as well and perhaps
reach  or more that would be eight-
een times the horse-power of the heaviest
of the new york centrals new electric loco-
motives which are among the most powerful
of their kind

her great speed

  as for the speed with which this vast mass
of steel will travel it is built to make twen-
ty-one knots an hour which is the equivalent
of about twenty-four miles but it is ex-
pected by the authorities that it will exceed
this speed just as the north dakota did
when she actually developed  knots
perhaps the florida which is designed to
be three knots faster than her predecessor
may develop up to twenty-five knots an hour
which would mean the equivalent of twenty-
nine or thirty miles when one considers
that such a great weight is being propelled
through a very dense medium-water-the
comparison of speed between a battle-ship
and a locomotive is not so greatly to the dis-
advantage of the battle-ship after all

  these comparisons will add interest to the
story of the putting together of such a huge
mass of steel and iron as the florida it
was an undertaking that could have been ac-
complished at only a very few places in the
world in some respects it was similar to
assembling the parts of a great locomotive
though it took over a year to do it and re-
quired a much more expensive plant

  perhaps the most crucial moment was
when this terrific mass slid down her mam-
moth tracks into the water at the brooklyn
navy-yard pn may  from the very out-
set those vital seconds had to be considered

  nowadays the launching of a great ship
has to be figured out completely long before
a single rivet is driven home just as the
tractive effort and weight on the drivers of a
locomotive are known before a dollar is laid
out on her every contingency must be
guarded against for the sagging of an inch
at this critical moment would endanger if
not ruin the ship
the greatest battle-ship in the world



   therefore first of all the ground under
the florida was made as solid as that under
a sky-scraper or the great new terminals of
the new york central or pennsylvania in
new york this was accomplished by dri-
ving in heavy piling and the use of plenty
of concrete and masonry

   on this base the keel-blocks were laid at
intervals of three or four feet rising at what
a railroad man would consider a frightful
grade from the waters edge-thirty-five feet
in less than six hundred that brought
the bow which pointed inshore high up in
the air the keel-plates were laid upon these
keel-blocks together with the parts immedi-
ately connected with them like a great back-
bone

  next the giant steel frames and ribs
seemingly sprouted out from the keel over-
night it was by adopting this idea from
shipbuilding that the new all-steel passen-
ger-cars of the pennsylvania were evolved
with their backbones and ribs of steel

   gradually the hull took its form the air
resounded with a rat-tat-tat of pneumatic
hammers and the clink of bolts as strip after
strip of steel was hoisted and fitted into
plape under the direction of the naval con-
structors

forts within a fort

  the gigantic traveling cranes two of
them which carried on this work were oper-
ated along an aerial cantilever viaduct in
the open air just as they are in a locomotive
or car shop these great carriers had a
hoisting capacity that would enable them to
pick up an ordinary locomotive and run
away with it perhaps toss it in the sea at
the sliore-end of the ship-yard

   to the ribs the binding ties of the bulk-
heads were riveted-the deck beams and the
various other parts the heavy red-painted
steel plates of the hull each lettered and
numbered were swung one by one to their
appointed positions sheathing this skeleton
in a skin of steel with almost magical quick-
ness

  the tremendous castings-such as the
stem that gives shape to the prow the stern-
post which carries the rudder and the pro-
peller-struts-were lifted into place and
riveted every one was as carefully tested
as the plates that go in to a boiler they may
have to resist an even greater pressure some
day when one of those twelve-inch projec-
tiles come in a head-on collision

meanwhile the double bottom was laid

    	rr

the great bulkheads built up and the many
compartments of the ship constructed in-
side the mass itself like a tower each turret
foundation rose upward to the level of the
deck simultaneously on the ground along-
side the ways the turrets themselves were
assembled

  each of them cost over four hundred thou-
sand dollars-about what would buy two
trains of  gondolas hauled each by an
articulated compound a large part of the
heavy belts of armor was also placed on the
ship before she was launched as it grew
the framework and the outside plating were
held upright by stout shores at innumerable
points each of which bore a part of the
enormous dead-weight and relieved the keel
of it

  day after day the great steam crane trav-
eled up and down beside the hull men
worked their shifts men of itll trades over
a thousand of them day after day naval
constructors followed every detail on their
blue-prints in the prim government offices
checking every minutest detail even to the
uttermost of the millions of bolts

  so the ship grew until the vast incoherent
network of plates and beams took on a co-
herent personality like that which grows
out of the plates and tubes that make a huge
locomotive something more than a mere copy
of blue-print no so-and-so-and at last
we have the florida

  here are a few of the figures translated
into railroad comparison-just some of the
more important for the whole mass in the
naval constructors office is a book almost
as thick as a dictionary and with almost as
many pages no one except the initiated is
allowed even a peep into it for though you
may go down and watch the ship building in
the yard the real and valuable facts are jeal-
ously guarded and you are permitted to copy
only certain selected items that book would
be worth thousands of dollars to a rival na-
tion 

  this was about all in the way of facts
that the naval constructor was willing to di-
vulge 

  the length of the water-line is feet
-about the length of an engine tender and
seven day-coaches

  breadth of load  feet i- inches-wide
enough for half a dozen railroad tracks

  mean draft  feet  inches which means
that the part under water is high enough for
the clearance of three sleepers one above the
other

  the ship is being fitted as a flag-ship and


the railroad mans magazine

among other things will carry metal furni-
ture

  the normal displacement is  tons
with a two-thirds full supply of stores and
fuel and a full supply of ammunition or a
full load displacement of  tons-some-
thing like the weight of two hundred consoli-
dation engines speed twenty-one knots

  indicated horse-power of propelling ma-
chinery on trial  - which will be
exactly seven times the horse-power of the
new pennsylvania electric locomotives typi-
fied by no 

  bunker capacity  tons of coal and
 tons of fuel oil to carry her at ten knots
an hour  knots in twenty-eighty days
-a run which if by a stretch of imagination
you can conceive as being made overland
would mean from new york to seattle to
san francisco and back to new york again
without taking on fuel

electricity the power

  almost everything except running the ship
is done by electricity the search-light and
electrical machinery alone costing 

  bearing in mind that guns are really noth-
ing but apparatus to propel projectiles
freight carriers each with its load of explo-
sive to be detonated at the end of its journey
the batteries will consist of

  main in turrets ten twelve-inch breech-
loading rifles costing  each and with
its mounts etc  equal to nine of
the eries articulated compounds in cost

  broadsides sixteen five - inch rapid-fire
guns which use up half the price of a flat-
car ever time they are fired

  secondary four three - pounders semi-
automatic two one-pounders semiautomatic
two three-inch field-pieces and two machine
guns

  torpedo tubes two twenty-one-inch sub-
merged

  in this connection it may be mentioned
that the new fourteen-inch gun has a muzzle
velocity of  feet a second sixteen times
the speed of a two-mile-a-minute train

  armor eleven inches thick

  two latticed masts used by range-finders
each worth  or about the cost of a
ten-wheel locomotive

  two funnels seventy feet high about as
long as a sleeping-car turned up on end and
with almost as great a diameter

  boilers babcock  wilcox with twelve
water-tubes

turbines four-screw parsons type ten

in all six for going ahead and four for going
astern they will make the great nickel-
plated propellers revolve  times a minute

  machinery and boilers cost as much as
ninety consolidation engines

  contract price for hull and machinery
 the average cost of locomotives
last year was  cents a pound the cost
per pound of the florida is twice that

  so much for the figures

  at last came may  the day for the
launching the day when the great ship was
practically two-thirds done everything had
been calculated out to a nicety nothing omit-
ted

  the launching itself was by far the most
ticklish piece of work of the whole business
for the larger the ship the more difficult it
is to get her into the water launching is
practically balancing this mass of metal on
two broad wooden tracks and sliding it down
into the water

  a word will not be amiss comparing the
florida with what the rest of the world can
offer in october  directly after the
russo-japanese war there was a most mys-
terious show of activity at the british navy-
yard at portsmouth england no one could
fathom what was doing

  there hedged in by the uttnost secrecy
the keel-plates of a new vessel were being
laid foreign navies tried their best to dis-
cover what the british admiralty was up to
gradually week by week hints and rumors
and facts leaked out great britain was
applying the lessons of the war

  for exactly one year after that date not
an important new ship in any navy in the
world was begun the world waited to see
what great-britain would dor

only the beginning

  then twelve months after the keel was
laid the great dreadnought slipped into the
water a huge -ton all-big-gun battle-
ship

  that was the lesson of the war-strength
plus simplicity at once every nation recog-
nized it germany absolutely revolutionized
her whole naval policy in a night from com-
plexity to simplicity france japan all fol-
lowed

  nor was america behindhand we began
slowly the michigan and south carolina
of  tons were begun in  then
in  the north dakota and the delaware
followed with  tons in  we be-
gan the florida and the utah of  tons

hen a railroad wants a
piece of real estate for
some improvement con-
tinued schwartz the
price goes up with a
whoop over at ren-
ner we wanted to erect a nice passenger-
station of stone and brick with curves min-
arets and porte cochere fancy enough to do
us credit and make the town proud to com-
plete the plans we had to have a house and
lot that was on die conrer of a street and the
railroad

  it wasnt much of a house and the owner
had had it in the hands of a real-estate shark
for sale for a number of years without a
buyer the owner would have sold it any
day to john doe or richard roe for a little
down and payments to run ten years he
would even have traded it for the semiarid
region of texas

  some way in the early formative stage of
our plans the owner got wise that the rail-
road would want that piece of property for its
new passenger-station and he doubled his
figures at once thereafter every morning
the first thing he did after getting out of bed
was to add another ten per cent tc the price

  a railroad cannot successfully conduct
real-estate transactions openly operations

series began in the july  railroad m

 are usually in the name of a third person
 and the railroad remains unknown until the
 deal is closed

   nothing compromises the intelligence of a
 good citizen so much or reflects on his native
 shrewdness so severely as to sell his property
 at his own figure and then wake up to find
 that a railroad company was the real buyer

   maud mullers  might have been  isnt
 a circumstance to the poignant regrets that
 rage in the breast of this upright citizen un-
 der such conditions

   when he sold to a private citizen he con-
 gratulated himself on a neat deal when he
 learned the transfer continued to the railroad
 he wsfs buncoed held up short-changed
 and whipsawed

   he could have gotten double if he had
 been wise enough thats a sad reflection
 so he kicks himself off the premises

    it isnt the matter of actual values but of
 the attitude of the owner

   in the eyes of hoi polloi all railroads
 are rich and powerful they not only pay
 fancy dividends and interest but their strong
 boxes are bulging with ducats and it is the
 sacred duty of the private citizen to relieve
 the pressure on the box in every way he can

   every town wants all the railroad improve-
 ments it can get it takes ground for im-

 ans mafiiine single copies  cents

provements and the individual owns the
ground the town boosts and helps along
collectively but the individual doesnt budge

  he has certain conceptions of patriotism
and of doing things for the good of the com-
munity but it does not reach his pocketbook
lessen his idea of the value of his private
holdings or his yearning for his countrys
coin so he holds tight

  his neighbors call him a hog and a
 fossil  for blocking an improvement they
argue with him then they abuse him for his
lack of public spirit

  he answers by raising his price another
twenty-five per cent

  no matter how valuable the proposed im-
provement is to the town or how badly it is
wanted some man must have his price out
of it

  this is the reason a railroad must cover up
its plans and operate by proxy

  i heard a sad story the other da of how
an ungrateful railroad  put one over  on
a trusting but thrifty attorney

  it was a case of building a second track
adding some sidings and widening the right-
of-way

  the attorney got into it in a professional
way that the railroad would have to have a
row of lots through his town some of them
improved

  the attorney did some work by proxy
he found the funds and had his nearest
friend buy the lots then he put them up
to the railroad at a handsome advance

  it was an artistic piece of work and shows
what a prudent man can do to a railroad
when he gets a piece of information in ad-
vance but there came an unfortunate hitch
the railroad did not like the figures

  it had another plan it was working out
that the attorney did not know of it made
a cut-off east of the town saved a half-mile
of running track and reduced the grahe

  the attorney still holds a row of properties
somewhat dilapidated and ill-kept abutting
the railroad he is still struggling for money
to pay the loan he made to buy them the
railroad will never need them

  the moral is that money should not be
invested on advance information of the im-
provements a railroad is to make for stuck
away in a certain pigeonhole is another plan
-and another so it isnt a dead shot until
the last minute and a wise man will never
speculate on anything but a dead shot

  schwartzs deals with farmers for narrow
strips along the right-of-way for the purpose
of the second track was a different proposi-

tion there was no secrecy about it all the
farmers concerned knew just what he wanted
and why so there was no chance for any-
thing only direct bargaining

  schwartz had one advantage if he could
not close the deal his company could take
the land anyway under condemnation pro-
ceedings that was the closing argument
even this was disputed and contested

  but in the miscellaneous assortment of
land-owners schwartz found some strange
characters with peculiar ideas and prejudices

  schwartz had no time for the fine art of
bargaining the railroad was in a hurry
construction work was pressing contract-
ors were coming on and it was up to schwartz
to produce the terra firma for them to op-
erate on

   it has always been the policy of schwartzs
road to be fair and just in its dealings with
all the people living along the line and
it prided itself on the good-will fostered

thereby

  schwartz is a pessimist he ranged up
and down among the railroads neighbors all
summer in close personal contact and he
has no faith in the friendship and good-will
the road had so assiduously cultivated

    its like the tail of haileys comet said
he  its diaphanously thin one cubic
mile of it can be packed into a snuff-box

  a few miles out a small farm touches the
railroad it is owned by a widow and her
son now a man of twenty-five the com-
pany wanted a twenty-foot strip of their
land

  on a warm day schwartz drove out to their
house

   the son was lying on the grass in the shade
of a fine oak-tree in the front yard he was
a pale anemic young man with only ten
or twelve red corpuscles to the fluid ounce
he had dreamy eyes a far-away look and
a lifeless indifference to worldly things

  schwartz extended a cordial greeting
the young man returned it with caution
a dog with a sniff of suspicion made a
close inspection of the visitor and seemed
to suspend judgment

  schwartz produced a blue-print and ex-
plained the object of his visit the young
man looked it over with about the same in-
terest that a man takes in looking over the
asset figures or the mortuary table produced
by a life-insurance agent

   well youll have to see ma he said at
length  its just as ma says but she
hasnt any land to sell to the railroad

  with this he relapsed into his former in-
observations of a country station-agent



difference and directed his attention to the
farm journal he had laid aside when
schwartz came up

  shes in the garden

 will you call her

 you had better go out there where she is
 if you want to see her

 ma was transplanting cabbage-plants

be the half-gallon can of sauerkraut he
would buy of his grocer during the christmas

week

   you see weve got to have the land
explained schwartz  we are double-track-
ing our line you know

  the woman transplanted with renewed in-
dustry but made no reply

these cabbage-plants have got to be set out to-day

she was an angular lady of sixty-five and
had a fighting face

  i aint got nothing to sell said she
tartly

  these cabbage-plants have got to be set
out to-day because the sign is right and i
havent any time to waste

  with this she gave an angry poke in the
dirt and placed a tiny sprout

  schwartz stood by and as there followed
an embarrassing silence he busied himself
making a mental calculation that in six
months hence that tiny wilting sprout would

   we can take it anyhow by having it
condemned by the court mrs weaver but
we dont want to resort to that

  schwartz paused but no response

   we want to come to an agreement in a
friendly way we do not want to go to
court if we can possibly avoid it there is
nothing in it for either of us mrs weaver
to pay big fees to lawyers and to be hauled
around by the sheriff

  with this lugubrious prospect schwartz
rested his case for a moment but the only
effect was to speed the cabbage-planting


the railroad mans magazine

  we want to be fair with you mrs
 weaver and we will pay you more than the
 land is actually worth we will build you
 a good new fence on the new line and will
 look out for the drainage

 the full details of schwartzs proposition
 carried him down one row and half-way up
 the next he explained and repeated and
 emphasized but he never drew a word or
 a hint

  ill come back again mrs weaver he
 said finally  you think it over a few days
 and you can let me know when i return

 schwartz paused a few moments with the
 son under the oak and talked of crops the
 weather and the prospects in general

 nice weather were having he ven-
 tured

 yes sir

  still we need a good shower

 a nod of the head

 we dont have any more real crop fail-
 ures in this country do we

 a negative shake

  a man who owns a piece of land like
 yours is well fixed for life continued
 schwartz with the air of a philosopher

  son  neither confirmed nor denied

  i told your mother i would be back again

next week i asked her to let me have her
answer we must know what we can do
you can talk it over with her i will see
you again good-day 

   good-day replied son listlessly

  schwartz drove away

  a week later to the moment he returned

  in the meantime son had gone to the old
leather trunk in the attic he searched
among the old papers of deeds and receipts
left by his father who had departed for
canaans shore some twenty years previous
at length he found the document

  it was written many years ago by the
father and was addressed to the son it
imposed upon the son a sacred injunction

  among the kentucky or tennessee hills
when a father solemnly enjoins his son or
sons before the final exit it is to perpetuate
the family feud-to shoot up the mcleods
or the robinsons wherever found or in what-
ever numbers and to die with their boots on

  old man weaver on contemplating his
final departure outlined no gory path for
his son nor imposed deeds of violence he
had no grudges against his fellow man and
he should and would have died in peace
had not his bosom been rankled by the in-
justice of the railroad

it imposed upon the son a sacred injunction
observations of a country station-agent



sammy did you tell him the railroad

 owed us already three hundred
and forty dollars  

  having no other troubles he borrowed
from the generation before him and passed
it to the generation that followed

  he wrote with a fine round flourish and
with an attempt at the literary grace and
elegance that were common in letter-writing
a generation ago

  my dear son

    this letter will be read by you after i am
  dead and gone and am reposing in the silent
  tomb i have lived in peace and tranquillity
  with my neighbors and t harbor no animosity
  toward any living man i never liked demo-
  crats but i forgive them one and all i am
  imposing on you my dear son the task of ob-
  taining justice from the railroad company that
  passes through our farm this road was built
  when my father owned the farm

    the company took a strip one hundred feet
  wide through his land and never paid him a
  cent there were no writings but there was
  a verbal agreement which in the light of jus-
  tice i consider to be morally binding on both
  parties my father promised to donate this
  right-of-way if the road was constructed within
  two years but it was two years and three
  months before it went through the road
  failed in the fulfilment of the stipulations by
  three months and the agreement became void

    my father sued them but they held him off
  the road became bankrupt it changed owner-
  ship a number of times he never got his pay
  he- left the account to me for collection i
  promised him on his dying bed to fight the
  railroad until it satisfied the obligation

    my son i have done everything in my power
  but i have not succeeded the railroad resorts
  to every known obstruction so my son i
  chronicle this to let you know that i have not
  like rip van winkle been sleeping on my
  rights but that i am awake to them and on

j mormam lvnd

  my death-bed i solemnly abjure you to continue
  the demand and if the opportunity ever conies
  to collect one hundred dollars and interest at
  six per cent

    my son always contest the railroads right
  and always oppose it in anything it undertakes
  with the further injunction that you always
  vote the republican ticket i bid you farewell
  my son until i meet you in the new jerusalem

            your loving father

                   israel obedtaii weaver

  with an almost religious fervor son com-
mitted this to memory and with filial affec-
tion placed upon himself the obligation im-
posed by the father

  schwartz returned

  the son was sitting under the same shade
languidly vengeful and ma was again in
the garden in silent memory of the gone
before  moralizing on the wickedness of the
world and propping up tomato-vines

 schwartz the railroad representative
saluted son with a sprightly nod and a
hopeful inquiry about his happiness and
welfare

  son did not seem to enthuse over either
nor did he waste any time in conventional
pleasantries nor adorn his proposition with
any qualifying persiflage


the railroad mans magazine

   you owe us three hundred and forty
dollars right now he said abruptly

   indeed  exclaimed schwartz in sur-
prise how is that

   you never paid for the original right-of-
way

   why explained schwartz  that wasnt
our company-and that was forty years ago
that should have been adjusted by the owner
of the land at that time you see clearly
we cant open a case of that kind at this late
date why we have been in possession
and we have had continuous use for forty
years and that alone establishes our rights
weve seen a lawyer said son he
tells us our demands are just we under-
stand that you can condemn and take the
twenty-foot strip you want now and the
court will accept the value placed on it by
three viewers ma and me have talked it
over we have made up our minds it will
cost you five hundred and forty dollars un-
derstand we sign no options when you
come along with five hundred and forty you
get your deed for all the land you are using
through our farm

  a tall form arose from the soil and leaned
over the garden fence

  sammy she called out shrilly did
you tell him the railroad owed us already
three hundred and forty dollars

  yes ma

   did you tell him we ask five hundred
and forty dollars

  yes ma

    not a cent less either 

   yes ma

   and weve seen a lawyer too 

  yes ma

  and that we dont sign no papers until
the come along with the cash  

  yes ma

  she subsided and resumed her tomato-cul-
ture at short range

   thats all there is to it sir said the
son picking up his farm journal and perusing
an article on the value of silos

   my dear sir said schwartz  we can-
not possibly entertain a proposition of this
kind it is entirely out of the question we
will have to go to court on this does your
mother realize they will drag her into court 
 they will probably let her walk in wont
they   asked son with apparent innocence
this nettled schwartz a little

   youll have a case in court all right and
youll lose money by it youll have to pay
lawyers and court costs and in the end you
will have less than i am prepared to offer you

right now which is two hundred dollars
you dont want any trouble neither does
your aged mother she is growing old
think what it means to her to be hauled into
court  schwartz added this half appeal-
ingly

  again mas tall form suddenly loomed
above the garden fence

   sammy she cried out  did you tell
him we aint goin to be bluffed

  yes ma

   and that well law em to-

   yes ma

  schwartz beat it there was nothing else
to do after a time he came back again
each time son confronted him with the same
languid doggedness and ma from over the
garden wall let fly many sizzling missiles of
censure and condemnation of schwartz the
railroad and mankind in general outside of
the honest farmer

  schwartzs fighting blood was up he
recommended that the company file action in
court at once to condemn

  but the real-estate department far re-
moved from the taunt and sarcastic reproaches
of the cabbage-patch coolly concluded it
would be about as cheap and make a better
title and be more satisfactory all around to
pay the amount asked and the road did it

  it was a great victory for israel obediah
weaver deceased and no doubt he twanged
his harp quite merrily and joined in the celes-
tial chorus with lusty exultation

  son wore his honors in the community
with becoming grace for he had put one
over  on the railroad mas cabbage and
tomatoes throve bountifully

  all of which goes to show how things are
divinely set and must come about

  while this was pending schwartz was
actively after other tracts

  miss arabella browning hoover owned
forty acres and schwartzs blue-print showed
that a twentv-foot strip had to be taken

  a woman landowner is usually a hard
proposition to deal with

  schwartz had misgivings and foresaw an-
other impossible ultimatum something like
he had gotten from ma and son

  at the gateway schwartz stopped long
enough to admire the vine-clad neatness that
surrounded the modest farmhouse

  the lady that met him at the door wore
large gold glasses and had her hair combed
straight back revealing a broad expanse of
super-thought area

  she was thin but spiritual-and no longer
young
observations of a country station-agent



  schwartz scented a strange and unusual
atmosphere he did not know the nature of
it so he outlined his errand as briefly and
directly as possible

  disappointment overspread the ladys face
 oh you are a railroad man she said
regretfully  i thought you were a pub-
lisher

   a publisher   ex-
claimed schwartz

   perhaps you do not
know you may not have
heard i am a literary
lady you may have
read some of my odes
never thinking you would
meet the author

  schwartz began to get
his bearings

   fiction 

   not yet but i may
in time i have com-
pleted a book of verse

   who are your pub-
lishers 

   the weekly clarion
printed them for me

i had them print me
five hundred copies it
is a collection of twenty-
five of my best short
poems every book has
my name written by
myself on the fly-leaf

i	have sold a number fo
them to my friends at
fifty cents each  do you
think that is too much  

   i think it is very
modest of you said schwartz gallantly  to
let them go at fifty cents why all the best
sellers are listed at one-fifty would you let
me look at one please i might take it
with me

  schwartz adjusted a pair of spectacles and
looked over the paper-backed volume with
the eye of a connoisseur

   i will take this one said he  my wife
will be delighted they are farm poems
railroad men everywhere love to think and
dream of the farm most of us came from
the farm and a poem that takes us back to
the meadow and the barn-yard touches the
heart indeed it does miss hoover

   that is it exclaimed the authoress
beaming in the ecstasy of full appreciation
that is what i write about-the common
things about the farm you will be pleased
take the second poem-there are twenty

verses let me read it to you she read
with feeling

 see the frisky spotted calf

 his antics fairly make you laugh-

 how merrily he kicks his heels

 showing how fine and sporty he feels

  hear the old cow softly moo-

 when sun is setting and day is through
 calling her calfie to her side

 in the dewy eventide

   did you write that  exclaimed schwartz
with a sort of startled amazement and adroit-
ly forestalling the remaining eighteen verses

  why say james whitcomb longfellow
couldnt do any better than that why youve
got rudyard reilly and john greenleaf poe
backed into a corner and yelping for help
indeed how figurative then you do
appreciate poetry

  i adore it

   how divine 

  why when i was only six years old i
could recite that famous poem beginning
 the boy stood for the cold-cold deck

    casabianca  


the railroad mans magazine

 thats it i could say it backward at
 seven 

   isnt that wonderful 

 schwartz struck a stage attitude   so
 live that when thy summons comes  that
 was a long one i recited that when i was
 eight

 what a splendid training

 quoth the buzzard never more i
 got that when i was ten

  the raven she corrected mildly

  why of course to be sure it was the
 raven how stupid of me

went on  i have two aunties out in oregon
that like poetry and two nieces in ohio going
to school and a number of my railroad
friends i think i will buy twenty-five of
your books

  the authoress was visibly affected
  schwartz seized the moment

 but this little business matter said he
 this twenty-foot strip of ground the rail-

  take number eighteen continued the
 authoress

   it is moonlight on the meadows

      and the mists are hanging low

   the cows are milked the chores are done
      soon will come clarindas beau

    a little jokefulness in poetry does not hurt
 the imagery do you think  

   why no agreed schwartz its just
 like wine with terrapin

    my favorite is number twenty-five  the
 woolly sheep 

   ill read that one to my wife schwartz
 hurriedly interposed let me see he

steeped his soul in music just as
he had in poetry

 

road wants we will allow you seventy-five
dollars for it i have the agreement all
written out you may sign it right there-
yes-on that line

   arabella browning hoover-i sign it in
full she said and repeating it with evident
pride  i am used to signing it in full in
my literary work all authors do that you
know

  schwartz paid cash  for twenty-
five volumes of bucolic rimes with the au-
thors autograph on each that went into
his expense account for he got the land dirt
cheap

  it was the most flattering appreciation and
the greatest sale the authoress had made she

itorman two-
observations of a country station-agent



was so delighted that the transfer of the real
estate was but an incident

  some retributive justice should compel
schwartz to read the twenty-five poems on
second thought and weighing to a hairs
balance he should commit them to memory

  schwartz solved another problem where
do all the phonographs go

  schwartz tells me he finds phonographs in
almost all the farmhouses that itinerant
pedlers make their monthly rounds to take
up exchange and distribute the records

  one farmer of whom the railroad wanted
a strip of land had just purchased a new
hundred-dollar machine and with it a hun-
dred records

  schwartz in a moment of weakness en-
thused over it so for two days he had to be
a sort of honored guest and hear the hun-
dred records through and back

  he steeped his soul in music just as he
had in poetry

  somewhere in between solos duets and full
choruses lincolns  speech at gettysburg
william jennings bryans  cross of gold
the  ravings of john mccullough the
shrill cries of piccolos the hoarse notes of
saxophones the rattle of xylophones to the
stirring music of regimental bands and wail-
ing orchestras schwartz succeeded in putting
through his real-estate deal even if he
couldnt get the sangerfest sound out of his
ears for a week after

   in that particular neighborhood said
schwartz  i was warned by all to look out
for  old hen loot i was told that i would
find him the toughest and ugliest proposi-
tion i had ever gone up against that no
one could deal with him without being bluffed
and abused and without losing the greater

part of his cuticle so i put off until the last
the disagreeable task of confronting loot
with our proposition

   i went to him expecting impossible con-
ditions

    he gave close and respectful attention to
my proposals he outlined the matter the
way it appeared to him within a half-hour
we had come to an understanding and signed
an agreement

     i have no prejudice against railroads
said loot  they are necessary to our pros-
perity they should be encouraged to im-
prove and develop it adds to the wealth of
every locality

    it was the most satisfactory experience i
had in that locality

  loot had a fine quality of good horse-
sense so the neighborhood couldnt under-
stand him

   i had encountered the concentrated op-
position of three generations of the weaver
family the pastoral verse of the lone spinster
and the hundred records of the farmer with
a phonograph but there were no frills to
loot just business

  all that bunch that had stood me off
double-crossed and whipsawed me warned
me against loot

  loot is on the square he knows em
all with their little knocks and sharp prac-
tise but they cant solve his delivery thats
all im glad i met loot

  no its not pleasant work buying real
estate for the railroad but we are done
this time if they propose running any more
tracks its me to the sawmill

   these stogies are not as good as them
you gave me last month been saving these
for me eh

what it costs manufacturers yearly to deliver machines and supplies to

their customers

the railroads of the country are making some-
thing out of the automobile business ac-
cording to a high authority on the subject the
railroads of the united states earn over eight million
dollars a year carrying automobiles and automobile
supplies

  he declares that an automobile factory pays for
ten times as many freight-cars and at a much
higher rate than a carriage factory producing an
equal number of horse-drawn vehicles and he esti-
mates that something like one hundred thousand
freight-cars leave the automobile factories a year

  the big factories that produce cars in large
quantities give the railroads each day for a large
part of the year enough loaded cafs to make up a
good-sized freight-train

  aside from this express companies earn nearly a
million dollars a year carrying tires and other fac-
tory supplies

red-painted station with its semaphore-pole
in front the barred windows of the gloomy
little telegraph-office in the center with a
battered door upon the left

  the latter bore the somewhat impressive
inscription of waiting room and some-
how managed to give the casual observer the
idea that the inhabitants of hansen were
ver impatient in their waiting and did a
great deal of it at the station there was a
water-tank on the other side of the tracks
with its big black spout drawn up at an
acute angle like some immense teapot and
the siding stretched away a half-mile or more
to another switch just in view from where
william stood

  all these with the trains that would pass
by in the night were to be the especial care
of william dobbs anderson aged seventeen

a newly graduated telegrapher from a well-
known school of telegraphy in his native
state and lately engaged by the l c and s
railroad to fill the position of night-operator
at hansen a position made vacant by the dis-
charge of an operator who had formed the bad
habit of whiling away the long hours of night
with the aid of a bottle of whisky

  behind the station the dusty street led
through the sleepy little cluster of houses
past the general store the post-office the
blacksmith-shop and then across a little
stream and out into the country

  when white had engaged william dobbs
anderson to fill the important post of night-
operator at hansen in spite of many mis-
givings as to williams ability none of
which william shared he had said to him
while writing out his pass  you wont find
very much work to do down at hansen dur-
ing the night but remember that what little
there is to do is mighty important and must
have your careful attention

   the company is not paying you to go
down there and sleep in the office nor to
entertain your friends with whisky and ci-
gars and i warn you that any slighting of
your duties will bring you harsher penalties
than if you had the possible excuses which
a busier job might offer attend strictly to
almost a

murderer



your duties and the company will speedily
find something better to offer you as you make
good

  all of which had impressed william that
the eyes of the whole l c and s railroad
company from the president and general
manager down would be continually focused
upon him at hansen and that when he had
shown them how attentive to his duties he
could be how skilful at the key he was and
what a cool brain and natural knowledge of
railroading were his there would be nothing
the company had that would be too good for
william dobbs anderson

  in his minds eye he could picture his
future meteoric rise like great men he had
read of from operator to despatcher then to
the positions of train-master superintendent
general manager in quick succession and
finally in a few years he would become
president of the very road which was now un-
wittingly buying his time at the rate of 
a month it occurred to him that when he
became general manager he would see that
the operators were better paid for had not
his professor told him that in the railroad
operator was the future railroad magnate
and of course he knew had he not taught
telegraphy to eight or ten of the present-day
magnates 

  boit while awaiting the realization of his
dreams he had formed a virtuous resolution
that he would give the strictest attention to
his duties and make a record for himself
upon which he would always lie proud to look
back when he became president of the l c
and s he would show that he was an op-
erator of no ordinary ability but cool quick-
witted and skilful as the best it was a
beautiful dream and had a most inspiring
effect upon the dreamer

  the tylerville accommodation had barely
disappeared in a cloud of smoke and dust
around the distant curve leaving william
staring about him on the station platform
when a young man appeared in the door of
the telegraph office and stared coolly at the
new arrival

   hallo pard guess you must be the new
owl-trick man arent you   and without
waiting for a reply continued  come in and
make yourself at home

  anderson picked up his brand-new suit-
case and walked into the office behind the
operator charley williams was a slim
ratlier undersized young man who judging
from general appearances one would con-
sider about twenty-three years of age but a
closer glimpse of his pale face sharp eyes

thin lips and hair worn slightly thin in
front left one somewhat in doubt as to his
real age he was known on the road as a
good man and to be depended upon in al-
most an- emergency an invalid mother had
heretofore embodied a reason why william
had on several occasions refused to take a
job a little higher up

  well what do you think of the city
he asked anderson when he had seen him
seated in the office you get a chance to
see about all there is of it from the platform
it isnt so large that you have to take a
trolley-car or a rubber-neck wagon to see the
principal points of interest are you going
to come on to-night or do you want to post
up first  

  mr white thought i had better take the
office to-night said anderson determined
not to make friends with williams too quick-
ly  i dont expect to have any trouble with
it

  oh no you wont have any trouble
there isnt anything much to do just to
block your trains and keep awake

  well perhaps i had better find a place
to board then can you tell me where i
can go  

  williams gave him directions and ander-
son started out to get settled in his new
quarters

   a ham-factory product if there ever was
one was williamss mental exclamation
well he struck a pretty easy berth to learn
in though and there may be the makings of
an operator in him somewhere cant always
tell by the looks of a frog guess ill have to
put the boys next wish i could be around
to hear the fun maybe ill come around
this evening and see how he hits it off he
may be all right

  when williams took his last order for no
 just before going off duty at six oclock he
said to the despatcher new man on to-
night

   whats his name  

   anderson i understand dont look
much may deliver the goods though

  all right thanks ill watch out for
him

  anderson came in just then with his lunch
and a look on his face which tried to say
 oh well its an old story to me ive been
in bigger jobs than this a good many times
but the look didnt deceive williams any
and he was particularly careful to explain
the duties to the new man the first shock
came to him and confirmed his worst fears
when he said to anderson  youll probably


the railroad mans magazine

get a  for the down drag about ten they
usually pull in here for water

  a   do you mean a train order 
williams gasped and stared at him a
man that didnt know one train order from
another  gee whiz i pity davis to-night
he gasped under his breath davis was the
night-trick despatcher and a good friend of
williams then he went patiently to work
and explained what a  was and how to
take it

   i may drop in and see how youre getting
along about nine or ten he said but be
careful and dont guess at anything and
hold your trains unless you are sure its all
right to let them go

  oh ill soon get on to the knack of it
replied anderson  of course theres some
things i dont quite understand yet but im
well grounded in first principles

  as williams walked home to supper he
groaned many times  hes well grounded
in first principles oh me oh my it would
be funny enough to make a cow laugh if it
wasnt likely to be serious gee i wouldnt
be in daviss shoes this night for a dollar
wont the fellows have a circus holy gee
lies well grounded in first principles hell
be blamed lucky if he aint grounded under
six feet of earth before morning im think-
ing

  back in the telegraph office william dobbs
anderson was making his debut in telegra-
phy no  came steaming in and the con-
ductor a little man all nerves came running
into the office

  got anvthing budd

   sir

  got any orders for this train your
blocks red

   oh yes i believe there is an order here
for no  is that your train

   well rather leastways it wuz when we
left morrisville

  anderson failed to recognize this pleas-
antry and handed over the  tearing it off
the pad

  the conductor read it

   humph uess you want our sigs dont
ye

   er-er-oh yes please sign it and he
laboriously placed the carbons back under
the three copies

  now he thought i have to send these
in to the despatcher

  he opened the kev and hesitatingly struck
off  gv-gv-hn

   i-i gv came back quick and clear
anderson stuttered a little then said in

a trembling shaky hand these are the
signatures for the order for no 

  ga go ahead snapped back the
despatcher

  burrows conductor brown engineer

  wt no what number

 how

  i say what number is the order the
despatcher asked spelling it all out slowly

  oh-its no-no  anderson man-
aged to gasp out

   wts ur name   whats your name 

  sir

  whats your name

  william made an interrogation-mark

  i say-w-h-a-t-s y-o-u-r n-a-m-e

   oh i didnt understand you its wil-
liam dobbs anderson

   complete  pm a s w ds came
back the reply and the wire was still until
another man began tareport a train

  nearly every man along the line had been
listening to the last of the conversation and
there wasnt many that didnt crack a smile
when that answer came  oh i didnt un-
derstand you its william dobbs ander-
son

  william dobbs anderson he was to all
the other men on the wire from that time
forth there was something in his reply
that night that tickled most of the men of the
key an experienced man would have re-
plied in just one word anderson and
would have abbreviated that if it were in any
way possible

  there is a tendency with telegraphers to
cut their conversation as short as possible or
rather to use the least number of words and
to abbreviate the words as much as possible

  to hear a man spell out his conversation
has somewhat the same effect as listening to a
man who stutters badly an experienced
man gets out of patience waiting for him to
say it and get done

  the abbreviations come with experience
and a person who was not used to them would
find some difficulty in figuring out what an
operator was saying even if it were written
down on paper if the operator were one who
had been in the business eight or ten years

  no  pulled out of hansen with a puff
and a snort the engine in some way con-
triving to express the opinion of the con-
ductor and engineer at the extra minutes
delay caused by the operator who didnt
know their signatures were needed on a 
order must be a bran new un was the
comment of bill brown the engineer  con-
siderable lack o sense 
almost a murderer



  back in the office at hansen william
dobbs anderson was soliloquizing to him-
self awfully rough fellows these train-
men but i suppose its natural cant
expect them to have the education and re-
finement of a clerical man er-operator
but his thoughts were cut short by a real-
ization that something was going on with the
instruments at his elbow the same repeti-
tion of dots and dashes were being clicked
off and half unconsciously he began to
think of what they might be

  funny sending wonder what it is

  and then suddenly it came to him  hn
-hn-hn gv hn-hn-hn gv
why thats my call he gasped and
quickly reached over and answered  h-n
 ty gn et  they gone yet

   who is it  he hadnt the remotest idea
what had been said to him or what was
wanted then followed a meaningless jum-
ble of dots and dashes an operators equiv-
alent of  oh blame it all cant you get
nothing 

  then slowand clear has number five
gone yet g-v

   oh yes sir just gone

  o s

   sir

   report them

  anderson had a faint idea that the des-
patcher was asking for the time they arrived
and departed and this he finally managed to
give him and upon receiving the despatchers
acknowledgment leaned back with a sigh of
relief

  thus the night passed a round cursing
by a train-crew who were stopped by his
red signal which he had forgotten to change
to clear for them though there was not an-
other train within fifty miles of hansen had
small dampening effect upon the self-satisfied
spirit of william dobbs the disrespectful
remarks of other operators along the line
were more effective but even these were for-
gotten when he had left the office in the
morning

  of jourse he soliloquized those fel-
lows are rather impudent but then of course
the- dont know me yet when i have had
an opportunity to show them how easily i
can do the work they will treat me with the
proper respect no doubt

  two weeks passed and william dobbs
anderson still ornamented the office at han-
sen during the hours of darkness his stu-
pendous ignorance of practical telegraphy
was being gradually made apparent to him
but on the other hand his increasing famili-

arity of the routine work to be handled during
his trick gave him sufficient satisfaction to
quiet any fears of his being unable to hold
the job

  that evening charley williams had re-
marked as he left the office  i hear there
will be a special down the line to-night a
party of the presidents going east look
out for them you will probably hear all
about it on the wire williams hardly real-
ized that anderson could learn scarcely any-
thing from the wire by listening to the talk
that went over it if an operator had some-
thing to tell william dobbs anderson it
must be told under difficulties

  therefore they seldom took the trouble tc
do it unless the necessity was great during
the evening william noticed the instruments
were making more noise than usual but his
interest did not take him far enough to find
out what it was all about a light drizzle
had set in and the wires were not working
very well like all beginners at his trade
he had had an inordinate desire to adjust the
instrument when he first came to hansen
but after williams had come on duty three
mornings in succession to find every instru-
ment entirely out of any sensible adjustment
he had cautioned anderson rather sharply
about monkeying with the adjustment but
the weather was fast making them heavy
and anderson final- ventured to monkey
and succeeded in making it sound much
clearer just then he heard his call

  try  he got after asking it to be
repeated

  what do you mean

  which way is  open

  anderson got the words  open and
holding his key open looked at the wire at
his right hand then he noticed it was
quiet he tried to adjust that as he had the
one upon which he was working he tried
pulling it up he tried turning it down he
tried the magnets close he tried them back
but in spite of all his efforts he couldnt make
it work

    yes its open i guess he said to him-
self and turned to the neglected wire at
which the chief was waiting he had been
adjusting nearly ten minutes and the
chiefs patience never of the best was quite
exhausted

   yes sir its open said anderson when
he got back to the wire

  what the chief said where he sat fuming
at the key is not recorded but it is sufficient
to say that even in an office where emphatic
language is far more common than any other


the railroad mans magazine

style his was strong enough to make every
operator and despatcher look up and grin
they did enjoy seeing old doc get in a rage
as long as they were not the cause of it

  but doc took another grip on himself and
tried again

   ground  west say when he said
slowly

   sir

  again he repeated slower than before

    i dont understand 

   do you know how to ground a wire  

   i dont believe i do but if you will
tell-

   do you see that strap that runs across
the top of your switchboard stick a plug
in the hole on the left-hand side of the wire
marked  and say when was all the
chief said not mentioning what he thought
business was being held up on the wire to
give this green operator a lesson in wire-
testing the presidents special was due to
leave the terminal in ten minutes and the
despatcher must get a line on things before
the special left considering which doc was
not in an engaging frame of mind to say the
least

  the wire lay open and he waited and
waited to hear the result of his instructions

    which plug shall i take sir  

  doc leaned back and groaned every one
in the office was listening by this time and
the groan had many echoes

  again he straightened up and slowly be-
gan to tick off

  never mind the wire kindly open the
window and say when

    now sir

  you got it wide open

    yes sir

  then kindly follow my directions jump
out head first and break your fool neck 
when he closed the key with a snap and
leaned back to recover his nerve while the
room echoed with the merriment of the force

  in the meantime anderson was recover-
ing what portion of his dignity he might
while he closed the window and again set- -
tied down in his chair to think it over and
plan what he would do when he became
president the instruments chattered away
drowsily the rain fell outside and streamed
down the window-pane and soon william
dobbs anderson was nodding in his chair
by and by he slumped down on his folded
arms on the table and was fast asleep he
had slept some time when it seemed he was
manager of the road sitting in his office next
to the despatchers room at grayville he

could hear the instruments as they pounded
away suddenly it pierced his consciousness
that they were calling him though it did not
seem strange that the call had been changed
to  hn

    i wonder whats the matter with those op-
erators that they dont answer he thought

  still the calling continued he tried to
shout to them to answer up but try as he
might he could not make a sound then he
jumped to his feet to go out and tell them
the movement woke him and he found him-
self back in the station at hansen some
one was calling hn steadily and persistently
he reached over and answered up

   coming yet was the query

  no sir

  are you sure they havent passed

   yes sir

  when they come give them the siding
be sure you dont let them get away from
you copy  copy 

  the order followed directing no  en-
gine  to take siding at hansen and meet
first no  and wait at marion till 
am for second no   anderson repeated
and got his  o k he noticed the other
order was directed to first no  at madison
the first station west of hansen a distance of
about twelve miles after the order was fin-
ished the despatcher called him again and
said

  first no  is regular train they are
making schedule time to keep out of the way
of presidents special-thats second  get
 in quick sos not to stop first 

  o k

  then he peered out the window again to
see if there were any sign of no  it was
black as ink he picked up his lantern got
up and put on his coat to be ready to run
out and open the switch when no  should
show up around the curve then he waited

  five minutes passed

  lucky i woke when i did to get that
order he thought

  then an awful thought occurred to him

  suppose  had passed while he slept
first  had already left madison he knew
the despatcher had said it was the regular
train regular no  was theiast midnight
passenger going east it usually had a day-
coach and two sleepers besides the smoking-
car and two baggage-cars probably a hun-
dred people were on it to-night

  he dashed out the door and peered up the
track toward madison trying to see the tail-
lights that must have passed fifteen minutes
ago if his fears were not groundless then
almost a murderer



 he hurried down die track to see if by any
 good fortune it was perhaps coming even
 then but no light showed through the fall-
 ing rain in either direction

   back to the key he rushed perhaps he
 could yet stop first  at madison he would
 confess everything he would admit he had
 been asleep on duty he would tell them
 anything if only he could stop that train if
 only he would not have on his conscience
 that awful crime-the crime of having
 brought death to hundreds of innocent men
 women and children oh the agony of it

   his eyes were bulging with terror the
 sweat was streaming down his face and his
 hand was trembling violently as he dived for
 the key

   but stop-his call-perhaps it was not so
 after all perhaps  had stopped up the
 road

    w says  left at  you sure they
 havent got by you are they there

   not here dont see them might have got
 by i was asle- he managed to stutter out
 with his trembling hand

   but the train-despatcher had snatched the
 wire away from him and was calling  mn 

   like mad and in the despatchers office there
  were oaths and hoarse cries

   mn-mn-mn

    i-i mn

   first 

   d  mn

   out of sight

   es r

   the wire went open as the nerveless hand

of the despatcher fell from the key and his
body slumped downward to the floor

  anderson his faculties sharpened by the
terror he felt had understood from the rapid
conversation of the despatcher and the man
at madison that first  had gone and 
had gone they would come together
nothing but a miracle could save them and
miracles did not happen in his day they
would smash together he could hear the
awful grinding roaring crash of it the
cries of the men the agonized shrieks of
the women the piteous wailing of little
children oh god he william dobbs
anderson had done it murderer the
feeling of the hunted took possession of him
he dashed through the open door and ran
he knew not where but ran blindly madly
desperately on anywhere to hide from the
sight of god and man murderer

  had he waited a moment more he would
have heard the key close as the operator in
the despatchers office jumped to his assist-
ance he would have heard mn call the
despatcher and report

  tail-lights showing up they are back-
ing up here will run them in-mn

  a long stretch of straight track the other
side of madison a kind providence that
brought the two trains to either end of this
stretch of track at the same time two watch-
ful and efficient engineers who saw each
others headlight in time to bring his train
to a standstill-these had saved the soul of
william dobbs anderson from the verdict of
murder

new cleveland to buffalo record

second section of twentieth century limited makes lake shore run of
 miles in  minutes

the long-mooted question as to whether the
distance between new york and chicago by
rail could be covcrcd in sixteen hours seems in a
fair way toward solution

  engine no  with combination-car two
sleepers and one buffet-car left cleveland over the
lake shore last month at  oclock thirty
minutes late and arrived at buffalo creek at -
rar making the run of  miles in  minutes

  considering the conditions of the run this time
is by far the best yet recorded at two points
along the route the work of track-raising is in prog-
ress and at other places culverts arc being built
a speed of fifteen mijcs an hour was made through
the ashtabula crossover also at erie while over
the derby culvert the speed had to be thirty-five

   	rr

miles an horn- the two sections of this train from
st louis and cincinnati come together at cleve-
land the second sections remarkable run of
much less than a mile a minute notwithstanding
slow-downs would seem to demonstrate the possi-
bility of a sixteen-hour run from new york to
chicago provided the track is in good shape

  with road-bed completed and in good shape the
time between cleveland and buffalo may eventually
be reduced to  minutes

  if this can be equaled on the other divisions a
sixteen-hour run from new york is as good as
assured

looking death in the face without batting an eye is a task which has fallen
to the lot of more than one railroad man many are the stories of hair-
raising episodes that have gone the rounds from one division to another
until they are finally forgotten in the routine of the days work

     what the layman calls bravery fearlessness and heroism the followers of
the rail are inclined to define as cool clean-cut nerve the man who hesitates
stops to think or draws back out of the path of danger when duty calls him is-
well he isnt in our class

     while some of mr seavers tales go to show that discretion is the better
part of valor there are plenty of incidents where nothing short of that dont-care-
a-whoop-what-happens spirit could have kept the eagle eye from giving her the
big hole

blood-tingling experiences of railroad men who calmly threw the dice
with death and won or lost with all the calmness
of their calling

ere comes old watson i say
  watson you can put up your
  dinner-can no  is aban-
  doned so that you are out
  this trip anyhow

     -well dont know as i
care much a rest is pleasant sometimes

   come over here and light up that dinky
little pipe and be sociable we were talking
about exhibitions of clean-cut nerve

   as far as exhibitions of nerve are con-
cerned there is not an engine turns a wheel
or a train crew that starts out on a run that
doesnt show samples of nerve most any
day theres  use in a man lying down
and crying because hes up against it if he
has piled them up theres no use in his pull-
ing his hair and crying  me che-ild me
che-ild like some of these biscuit-shooter
actorinas he is up against it and thats
all there is to it

  i see in one of the papers an account
of where a brave engineer went down to
death in his engine to save the passengers
when he could have saved himself

  more fool he the man who is fool

enough to stick to an engine when he can
save himself by jumping has no business
pulling the throttle after he has shut her
off and put on the air he has done all he
can and after that he is simply committing
suicide if he dont go overboard while he
has a chance

leaping for life

   why i knew a case on one of the west-
ern roads where by a despatchers mistake
no  passenger north bound got orders
to meet no  freight south bound at a
station that we will call larkin while no

	got orders to meet no  at stevens six
miles farther south as a result the two met
half-way between the stations and fortunate-
ly on a two-mile tangent no  was the
fast mail and  was a fast freight and the
two were getting over the iron pretty fast

   billy hawkins was the eagle-eye who was
pulling no  and as  swung into the tan-
gent ahead of him he knew they were bound
to mix now when an express running forty-
five miles an hour meets a freight running


told in the roundhouse



 thirty-five miles an hour on a two-mile tan-
 gent there is not much time to ask questions

    billy threw her over slammed on the air
 yelled to his fireman and went out the gang-
 way without stopping to catch the hand rail
 he hit the ground rolling charlie grey
 who was pulling the freight saw no  about
 the same time so he threw her over slammed
 on the air and tumbled overboard without
 waiting to pick a soft place to light

   the engines came together jammed in
 their front ends threw their headlights clear
 of the right of way and made a considerable
 fuss the passenger-engine being a ten-
 wheeler tried to mount and ride the big
 consul neither engine was very badly
 damaged their front ends were smashed in
 clear back to the flue sheet but the saddles
 were not hurt

    the express messenger and
 the postal clerk were shaken up
 and bruised somewhat but
 when they heard billy squeal
 they knew there was something
 doing and each of them jumped
 and caught the hand-rail in
 their cars and swung clear
 while boxes and other stuff was
 being shot around over the floor

   nobody was hurt both en-
 ginemen had done all that mor-
 tal men could do to avert the
 danger and when they went
 overboard they acted like sen-
 sible men there are instances
 where a man has no time or
  opportunity to jump the en-
 ginemans first instinct is to do
 all in his power to save his train
 and then look out for himself

 to see another train coming at
 you as fast as it can drive and
 you coolly sit there throw her
 over and put on your air re-
 quires cool hard nerve when
 you know that every second
 counts and that by putting on
 your air you may be losing your
 last chance to come clear yet i
 dont know a runner anywhere
 that is not just that kind of a
 fellow but theres few of them
 that would be fool enough to
 stay on an engine one second
 after he had done all that he
 could and knew that no power
 on earth could prevent them
 getting together what good
 does it do a man to have the

newspapers print columns about his bravery
when he is dead and gone

  there is another instance of cool hard
nerve that i heard of where an engineman
coolly and deliberately took the chances of
an almost certain smash yet escaped without
damaging a hair it was on the kansas
city southwestern the latham construc-
tion company was building the road from
beaumont to arkansas city at beaumont
connection was made with the frisco

over a tricky track

  latham the original contractor who
formed the construction company bearing
his name was a good contractor and a good
builder but he was not an engineer the

without waiting
to pick a soft
place


the railroad mans magazine

company had a chief engineer who was an
englishman latham had called for cross-
sections but the engineer said that cross-
sectioning was a useless expense that all
that was necessary in railroad building was
to  cut off the ills and fill up the oles

   so the location stakes were marked with
the amount of cut or fill and the subcon-
tractors turned loose the specifications
provided that the waste from the cuts should
be drawn out and used as far as might be
possible to make the fills and that no ma-
terial should be borrowed unless it was
absolutely unavoidable

   well that grade was a siglit for gods
and men at the foot of the liill the earth
was drawn out of the cut and piled up
until the crown was in some places twenty-
four feet wide while in the middle of the fill
the crown was not more than ten feet in
width at one place where the fill was
rather a long one the crown in the center
was less than eight feet wide so that the
ends of the ties when the track was laid
extended over the edge of the bank

  for some reason that i do not know
latham got up against it good and proper
financially and he had some twenty miles of
track down and no money to go farther so
he made a dicker with the frisco and they
finally agreed tc take over the line and com-
plete it to arkansas city

   they sent a man out to inspect the work
and latham had an engine and car ready to
meet the fellow at beaumont and take him
over the work now latham knew that if
the engineer saw this particular fill he would
condemn the work and that meant good-by to
the deal so he took frank randall the en-
gineer to one side and told him what he was
up against and said that when he got to that
fill he would contrive to attract the en-
gineers attention to something inside the car
and that when he struck that place he want-
ed him to go over it as fast as he dared
well randall was a reckless kind of a devil
and for that reason could not hold down a
regular run on any of the old roads

   he knew that if he hit that piece of
track which was on a new fill and not yet
surfaced with any sort of speed he would
go in the ditch as sure as a gun they
started out and for the first few miles it was
all right then latham when he saw that
he was nearing this fill called the engineers
attention to some blue prints and the en-
gineer thinking that he would see this por-
tion of the track on his return gave his at-
tention to the prints

  frank pulled her wide open and sailed
across that fill as though he had a solid
rock - ballasted track under him he ex-
pected every minute that the track would slip
and pile diem all down the bank but he sat
there just as unconcerned as though he was
standing on a siding

   luck was with him and they swung
around the curve into a cut and he shut her
off when they got to the front latham
kept the engineer busy looking at material
plans etc until dark and then they started
back to beaumont the deal was consum-
mated the road transferred and latham
went ahead with his work the first thing he
did being to get the work-train out and
widen that bank

   after that no grading was done without
cross-sectioning and when the road was com-
pleted it was up to the average of western
roads randall said that he wouldnt make
a run like that again for any man on earth

no money for the men

   i heard of another case of nerve which
while it was not an engineman this time was
as much a case of cool hard nervy work as
i ever heard of

   a little road out in kansas was being
built and they had fifty miles of grading
done thebridges in and about twenty-five
or perhaps thirty miles of track down for
some reason probably the fault of the under-
writers the supply of money suddenly ceased
and left the company with this piece of road
several hundred men with two or three
months pay due them and general dis-
satisfaction all along the line

   when the superintendent was advised
that there was no money available and none
in sight it was up to him to do something
it was all very well for fellows in kansas
city and chicago to instruct him to stop the
work until the funds were available but
they did not have to confront an angry mob
of the toughest men on earth who were not
only bad medicine on general principles but
who had a considerable show of right on
their side to justify any overt action that
might take place

   there was nothing for it but to tell
the men that there was no money for them
and that he did not know when there would
be and that he had been ordered to stop the
work until money should be forthcoming

   the superintendent was a young fellow
not long out of school but he was just as
cool and nervy as they make them he or-
told in the roundhouse



tiered out an engine and told the engineer
to run in the back motion down to the front
and that it might be necessary to make a
run for it fast running on a new and un-
settled road-bed and on a track only partial-
ly surfaced is a vast sight more risky than a
mile-a-roinute schedule on a solid road-bed
with track laid in two feet of rock ballast
thoroughly tamped

  the young fellow put a forty-four in
his side-pocket and a supply of loose cart-
ridges in the other
side - pocket of his
coat and the- went
to the front here the
superintendent took
his stand with his
back against a box
car that was used as
a cooking-house and
called the men up

he told them briefly
that the company was
at a standstill for the
time being owing to
financial complica-
tions that there was
no money available
for their wages and
he did not kno w
when there would be

   the engineer
backed his engine
two hundred feet
down a piece of
track that had only

been spiked at ends and centers in doing
so he was acting against the superintend-
ents instructions but he saw the temper of
the gang and he meant to be just as close to
the nervy young fellow who stood leaning
against the side of that box car as he could
get so that if it came to a mix-up the engine
would be in easy access

  for a moment there was silence then a
muttering began which increased to a roar
and some shouted to lynch the super

a little straight talk

  hold on there men said the superin-
tendent dont tear your shirts you arc
not going to do any lynching for you are too
darned cowardly and besides you know
that every man jack of you would be hunted
down to the death furthermore some of you
will go to the happy hunting-grounds before
you get me

i am not responsible for the companys

that meant good-by to the deal

failure to provide the money my wages are
due as well as yours but i am here to build
this road and to carry out orders i intend
to build this road i intend to carry out
orders you can go ahead with the work
and trust to the future for your pay or you
can stop work now just as you choose any
man that wants his time-check can have it

   a few men yelled to rush him but the
majority were silent

    come men he said  i want to know
what you intend to do i am going back
very shortly i am here to give time-checks
to such as want them you may be able to
get them discounted in the neighborhood i
dont know i am going to shove this work
ahead if i have to wait six months for the
money you will all get every dollar that is
coming to you but i cant say when

     ill take my pay out of your hide one
brawny irishman yelled and started for the
young fellow without moving or in the
least changing his careless lounging position


the railroad mans magazine

beside die car he shot through his pocket
the ball striking the fellow in the left shoul-
der turning him half around and the en-
gineer told me that he had never in his life
seen such a silly expression on a mans face
as came over that of the irishman

with the crack of the shot pande-
monium seemed to have broken loose many

think they are we can hold the gangways
against the whole gang

  the superintendent saw that the engi-
neer was wise in his day and generation
and thanking him he said that he would
not have thought of the engine being the best
place for him to stand off the mob and be-
sides if it became necessary they could pull

ill take my pay out of your hide  

of the terriers were for rushing the young
fellow but the majority were against it in
the meantime the engineer swung out of the
gangway and got the superintendent by the
collar of his coat and actually swung him
bodily on to the engine he told me after-
ward that he couldnt do it again to save his
life

  the superintendent turned toward him
rather angrily when the engineman said

    its all right for you to stand down
there in front of that- mob with your back to
a car but i am in this scrap too and i want
you here on the deck of this engine and if
they can take you off thty are better than i

out at any time and leave the hoboes to chew
the rag as long as they had a desire to

   the mob made another rush but the
superintendent saw that out of over two hun-
dred men there were only fifteen or twenty
who made the rush and he scanned their
faces closely so that he could identify them
later

   then he stepped to the left gangway
and called the time-keeper

    tom he said  hand me up your time-
books

   tom did so

    now men all who want their time-
checks sing out their names but remember
told in the roundhouse



that when i give you this time-check it is
your discharge from the work

    to perdition with the work we want our
money yelled some

    i told you that i had no money and that
t did not know when i would have i will
give all who want them time-checks which
will be cashed as soon as the company has
the money more than this i cannot do
sing out now i wont stay here all day

   slowly a dozen men came up and got
their time-checks

establishing credit

    now you fellows that have got your
time clear out-vamoose and dont let me
catch you on the work again now you
fellows that want to stay with the work i
dont think it advisable to resume work until
i have further advices but you will have
your chuck just the same and during the
time that you are not working i will have the
boarding boss charge your bills to the com-
pany and not against you so you will only
be out a few days which you can spend in
hunting and fishing and resting up

  the men cheered at this and one of
them the boss track-layer stepped forward
and said

     see here mr franklin if you will give
us your word that you will see us paid in
full we will go ahead with the work as long
as the material lasts

    i tell you obrien that i do not know
any more than you do when the company
will succeed in raising funds it may be next
week it may be three months but i will
pledge you my word that as soon as the
funds are available you will get every dol-
lar of your pay

     see here byes said obrien turning to
the crowd  what differ is it to us when we
get our money so lie as we gets it if yez
were paid eviry mont yez would only blow
it in yez can have a bigger blow-out wit
tree monts pay than only wan

  this was a new view of the case and it
appealed to the most of them with force
obrien mixed with the crowd a little while
and then he came back to franklin and said
  the byes have decided to go ahead wid
de work and want you to keep their money
till they call for it but they wont trust the
company

  very well i will hold all the wages as
soon as i get money until you call for it
well sir that fellow franklin went
ahead and kept the work going he rustled

among the local dealers and the farmers for
supplies and provisions so he kept the com-
missary supplied though in buying on
credit and uncertain credit at that he had
to pay at least twenty-five per cent more
than the value of the stuff but he went
ahead shoving the road right along and the
little combination that had been worked to
freeze out and squelch the enterprise failed
because a young fellow stood up before a
mob of hoboes and defied them and by sheer
nerve compelled them to go ahead because
of their admiration for his sand

   the engineer told me that it was the
nerviestpiece of work that he ever saw and
for the first hour he would not have given a
lead nickel for the lives of either of them

   i was told of a case that for cool calm
nerve went a little ahead of anything that
i have heard of for some time my inform-
ant did not give the name of the road or
the engineer and i did not ask it it was on
a line up in minnesota michigan or wis-
consin at any rate it was in the pine lum-
ber country

a relief expedition

  word came that a fire was raging in
the forest and that a camp of lumbermen
which was reached by a logging road was
in danger of being swallowed by the fire and
that the men had no way of escape for the
logging locomotive had broken down

  this young fellow was handling a work-
train and was on the siding at the station
where the logging road connected with the
railroad he said that lie was going after
the men and asked for some one to volunteer
to run out after them as the forest was
on fire between the station and the camp
they would have to run the gantlet only
one man volunteered to go with him and that
was his fireman

   they cut out a couple of boxes and
started at full speed for the camp now a
logging road is not built with any view to
speed and in many places one had to run
very carefully to avoid being ditched

  but this couple did not wait to consider
the condition of the road they went bump-
ing and thumping along and in an hour
had reached the canip the road was yet
free of the fire when they went in but it was
sweeping down rapidly and there was 
time to lose

  the lumbermen tumbled into the box
cars without attempting to save anything
all they cared for was to get out of there


the railroad mans magazine

the engine and cars were turned on the wye
and in fifteen minutes after he had reached
the camp they had started back

   on the return they found that the fire
had swept up to the logging road and was
then crossing it and for at least a quarter of
a mile they would have to run through a
veritable tunnel of fire the engineer and
firemen dipped their coats into the tank and
saturated them thoroughly and also wet some
gunnv-sacks that they had picked up at the
logging camp which they wrapped around
their heads leaving only a narrow opening
for their eyes

blazes on both sides

   all this time the engine was darting
ahead and coming nearer to the fire which
was raging like a furnace the engineer
hooked her down in the corner and pulled her
wide open at this point the track was exceed-
ingly rough and there were nine chances out
of ten that the engine would climb the rails
and turn over but they took that chance it
was a case of death either way and they
concluded they had rather die quickly in a
smash-up than to be roasted

   he caught a glimpse of the road occa-
sionally as the wind would sweep the flames
aside for an instant and he saw that in some
places the ties were burning he and the
fireman wrapped the gunny - sacks more
closely about their faces covering even their
eyes and both crouched down on the deck

behind the boiler-head leaving the engine
to drive ahead into the mass of fire and keep
the rails or go into the ditch it was all the
same for they could not avert the derail-
ment if it should occur and their only chance
was for a dash through the blazing trees

   the engine rocked and bounced and
they thought on two different occasions that
they felt the thump of the drivers on the
ties but in a few moments a breath of cool
air blew on them and unwrapping their eyes
enough to peep out they saw that the train
had run through the strip of blazing forest
and was now ahead of the fire

   he eased her off a little but the fire
driven by the strong wind was creeping up
behind them and burning brands would be
torn from the burning trees and thrown far
ahead and in an instant the dry pine needles
on the ground would be blazing like a pile
of straw but after running another mile they
found they were drawing out of the fire-zone
and the reckless speed was reduced until the
engine was running somewhere within the
limits of safety again

  they pulled up to the station and then
stopped the box cars were on fire and burn-
ing in half a dozen places while the engine
was a sight to behold she had been so
badly scorched and her smoke-box and jack-
et were so red where the scorching heat had
wiped away the paint that the engine looked
at first glance as though she was red-hot
from pilot-beam to cab

  the lumbermen tumbled out of the cars
all of them more or less
scorched and when the
fireman and engineer
climbed down out of the
cab and struck the depot
platform both of them
fainted fortunately nei-
ther were burned but the
heat had been so intense
that the gunny-sacks and
their coats were thorough-
ly dry and were smoking
in spots

   from the time they
wrapped the wet gunny-
sacks around their heads
until they came out of the
fire could not have been
more than fifteen minutes
yet each of them said aft-
erward that it seemed to
be a lifetime efforts were
made by the newspaper
men to get them to tell the

all this time the engine was darting ahead
told in the roundhouse



story but neither of them seemed to think
they had done anything remarkable and
would never talk about it if the subject could
be avoided

  at one time the  river got on a tear
and like many of the streams in northwest
missouri it did just what it was least ex-
pected to do never in the history of the
section had the  been so far out of her
banks for some ten days all train service
on the creston branch was abandoned then
dave winton who was superintendent sent
will craig who was a freight-conductor
and dempsey with engine no  pulling a
way-car to endeavor to get through with the
mails there were many places where the
track was under water for miles and no one
knew whether the roadbed was still there or
not

taking the mail through

  all went well until they reached bolck-
ow beyond that station and nearly all the
way to barnard the water was running over
the tracks the train stopped and craig
and dempsey held a consultation orders
were to get the mails through and they de-
cided to make the trial craig got a hoop-
pole and walked along the track sounding
with it as he went and thumping the ties
the train followed him slowly if the track

craig got a hoop-pole and walked along
the track sounding

was still there and the water was not deep
enough to reach the fire-box and kill the
engine they could get through

navigating by rail

   at times the water was up around
craigs knees and for a time it seemed as
hough they would have to wait where they
were until the flood had gone down but
fortunately the water proved to be low
enough and they finally got through demp-
sey and his fireman stood in the gangways
ready to jump is the track should slip and
throw the train down the bank and they ran
through at a rate considerably slower than
the average man would walk

   once or twice they thought they felt the
track slip but it proved to be nothing seri-
ous and they pulled into barnard safe and
sound between barnard and maryville the
roadbed was a little higher and the water
did not seem to have gotten over it so badly

ok


the railroad mans magazine

   on the return trip they found that though
the water had gone down the track had
slipped in several places and at one point
the wet rail was immediately over the edge of
the bank while the ends of the ties rested
on thin air neither craig nor dempsey ever
said much about the matter and neither of
them seemed to think that they had done
anything remarkable i doubt if craig in
his report even mentioned the fact that he
had to wade ahead and sound the depth of
water the old man had sent them to get
the mails through they got them through
but how they did it they did not consider
was anybodys concern it was all in the
days work and that was all there was to it

a civil war incident

   i do not know of any calling that re-
quires such cool calm nerve in all branches
of the service as railroading during the
civil war there were a great many railroad
men in both armies and they were frequently
employed in handling trains in cases of im-
minent danger not only from shot and shell
but none knew where a track might be
mined or a bridge wrecked we read lots
of stories of hairbreadth escapes and brave
actions but for some reason there is little
if any note made of the exploits of the rail-
road boys

   i was told some time ago of an instance
that occurred during the war the rebels
had a lot of supplies among others a quan-
tity of powder that was in serious danger of
falling into the hands of the federals during
shermans march from atlanta to the sea
it was at a little station on a road running
out of atlanta i believe it was called the
georgia great southern but of this i am
not sure anyhow the name of the road is
immaterial now

   among the men in the rebel army was
an engineer named spence i fired for him
after the war and he told me the story him-
self the rebel commander was in a great
stew about losing this stuff especially the
powder and he called on his men to know
if any of them were locomotive engineers
spence and another fellow named downey
stepped forward

  the colonel called them into his tent
and asked them if they would volunteer to
take that train of supplies out spence said
he would if he could get a good fireman
downey who had not had an opportunity to
speak first then spoke up and said that he
would fire the engine

   the only engine available was an old
mill named the tuscumbia engines being
named instead of numbered in those days
she was an antiquated old scrap-heap even
for that period spence and downey set to
work and after several hours of hard work
got her in shape so that they thought they
could get her over the road but her flues
were leaky and she was liable to die on them
at an minute if this should happen any-
where near the enemy it meant a northern
prison at the least

   they chose to go out at night and it was
one of those dark black rainy nights when
you couldnt see your smoke-stack they
had no headlight and it would not have done
to light it if they had

   the- pulled out about midnight the
third car in the train containing the powder
the federal troops were closing in and the
rebel soldiers had to be on the move just
before they were ready to start the colonel
came up and taking spence aside told him
that his scouts had brought in the informa-
tion that the federals had struck the rail-
road about ten miles below and had thrown
up earthworks at a point that would com-
mand a curve though the earthworks were
not erected with a view to that purpose and
that they would have to run the gantlet

a dangerous cargo

   wishing them good-by the colonel stepped
aside and after having taken farewell of
their comrades who considered that they
were going to certain death they started
shortly after the- pulled out the storm in-
creased in violence the rain came down in
sheets and poured against the cab windows
until it seemed as though they were almost
running through a stream of water the
lightning flashed incessantly and the roll of
the thunder was almost continuous the
noise of the storm was such that it effectually
drowned any sound made by the train but
the tuscumbia was a wood burner and she
threw a constant shower of sparks which
readily betrayed her presence

   after running a few miles they stopped
at a haystack and piled a quantity of the
wet hay upon the back of the tender as
they came near the spot where they believed
the federals were concealed downey who
had a hot fire threw in a lot of the wet hay
in the hope that it would stop the shower of
sparks it succeeded for a time but when
they were nearly opposite the federals they
saw a picket fire close to the track and knew
told in the roundhouse



the jacket of the tuscumbia was a perfect sieve

that they could not run much farther before
they were discovered

   at this instant the wet hay ceased to be
effective and the tuscumbia threw out a
shower of sparks they heard the alarm
shot fired by the picket and spence pulled
her wide open and then crouched down be-
side downey back of the boiler-head where
they would have the drivers and lockers on
either side as a protection against bullets
they heard the roar of a cannon and the
ball took the bell away

   the sharp crack of musketry was heard
and they could feel the thud of the bullets
as they struck the engine the cab windows
were shattered and fell in a shower of glass
over the two men a second cannon-ball
passed through the car of powder but fortu-
nately so high that it passed over the barrels

   they swept around the curve and into
the darkness beyond followed by a storm of
bullets as long as they were in range but
they got through and delivered the train and
supplies intact safely at their destination

  the jacket of the tuscumbia was a per-
fect sieve so full of bullet holes was it while
the cab which was of wood was riddled
and a mass of splinters spence heard after-
ward that when the jacket was removed the
wooden lagging was full of minie balls

   spence was called upon for engine serv-
ice several times after that but he never
again had such an exciting run as when he
ran that gantlet the colonel and the whole
regiment were captured so that spence never
had an opportunity to report to his com-
manding officer as to the result of the ex-
pedition

a steam-electric locomotive

anew steam-electric locomotive is being built
in england it comprises a steam turbine
which operates the dynamo-supplying current for
four series-wound motors the engine is being
designed to haul express-trains and will be tested
in actual service so as to show its efficiency as

compared with the ordinary steam-locomotive it
is pointed out that turbo-generators have proved so
efficient in stationary plants that a similar system
would very probably prove to be of value on rail-
ways to replace steam-locomotives particularly on
short suburban lines
ah those were the days

according to a report published eighty-five years ago a railroad cost
only ahout three times as much to build as a
good turnpike road

the american mechanics magazine of april
 s said

   the intention of the present scheme is to in-
troduce a more economical and expeditious mode of
conveyance than is now in use for vehicles of every
kind whether employed in the transportation of
persons or merchandise it is proposed to super-
sede entirely the necessity of horse-power in all
public wagons stages and mail-coaches post-
chaises etc and to employ in its stead the more
potent agency of steam a careful examination of
the drawings now presented to the public as a plan
of general iron railway will it is hoped clearly
demonstrate the ease safety and celerity with
which vehicles of every denomination for the con-
veyance of goods and persons may be propelled
by mechanical power    the value of rail-
roads as a medium of commercial communication
has not escaped the sagacity of dr young in his
lecture on natural philosophy he said

    it is possible that roads paved with iron may
hereafter be employed for the purpose of expe-
ditious traveling since there is scarcely any resist-
ance to be overcome except that of air and such
roads will allow the velocity to be increased al-
most without limit

  - iron railways are of two descriptions the flat
rail or tramroad consists of cast-iron plates about
three feet long four inches broad and half an
inch or one inch thick with a flattened or turned-
up edge on the inside to guide the wheels of the
carriage these plates rest at each end of stone
sleepers three hundred and four hunched weight
sunk into the earth and they are joined into each
other so as to form a continuous horizontal path-
way these of course are double and the dis-
tance between the opposite rails is from three to
four feet and a half according to the breadth of
the car or wagon to be employed

       when wrought iron is used which is found to
  be equally cheap with cast metal and greatly pref-
  erable in many respects the bars are made of
  smaller size of a wedge shape and twelve or eight-
  een feet long but they are supported by sleepers
  at the distance of every three feet the wagons
  used generally run upon four wheels of from two
  to three feet in diameter and carry from twenty tp
  fifty hundredweight    yet a railway costs
  only about three times as much as a good turnpike
  road it is obvious then that if railways are to
  come into general use two-thirds or more of the
  expense of transporting commodities would be
  saved

    that locomotive engines are not only capable
  of performing all that has been promised in some
  of the prospectuses for new railroads we are very
  ready to admit nor would we indeed wish to be
  hurled along at the rate of twenty miles an hour
  but that they are an important improvement in
  science and in their application of human means to
  the great purposes of commerce cannot we think
  be denied by any except those whose interest is di-
  rectly opposed to the adoption of them

     an enthusiastic correspondent of a providence
  rhode island paper who claimed to be- die inventor
  of the cheapest railroads yet devised gives the fol-
  lowing description of his invention with the costs
  of material etc

     only one english engine alone costs two thou-
  sand dollars which sum the whole of our apparatus
  does not much exceed as figures will prove for
  seven hundred chestnut rails at three dollars
  amounts to only twenty-one dollars and it ought
  to be remembered that this is all the expense we
  are at and the inference is conclusive in our favor
  we place our rails fifty to the mile by the side of
  the road to pry out the wheels when they get stuck
  and hoist behind when wanted

chapter x

surprising blander

 hen vincent wilson ac-
 costed the surprised blan-
 der in the auditorium of
 the continental hotel he
 looked unconcernedly at
 the man he had been wait-
 ing for and simply said 

  hallo blander 

 the man turned as white as a sheet

 he gulped a few incoherent remarks he
 appeared to be choking at one time he
 trembled and a flood of perspiration rushed
 to his face

 wilson was alone with him tom tracie
 and jimmie winters were in their seats taking
 in the extraordinary proceedings

 trades keen detective eye told him that
 wilson had found his man tracie had dealt

began in the may railroad man

too long with criminals not to know when one
was landed

  and as he afterward told a man when reci-
ting this incident  nothing so quickly brings
a man to his senses-especially one who has
absconded or is fleeing from justice under an
assumed monacher-as to call out his right
name there is something in the rigid twist
of the body there is a peculiar gleam in the
eye there is a telltale expression that comes
into the face that the trained detective can-
not let pass why i have come up behind
suspected men called out their right name
anti they have turned like a shot i never
knew it to fail

  blander was clivers and clivers was blan-
der

  wilson was keen enough not to let the
slightest suspicion enter into his meeting with
the man he was hunting as if it were the
most accustomed thing for him to meet the
officers of the mainland system at new york

hotels every day of his life he greeted the
newcomer 

  i didnt know that you were in new
york said wilson very quietly-just as
one old friend greets another he didnt
want to spoil his game he wasnt going to
let blander-for cliverss correct name was
stephen blander and he held the responsible
position of assistant auditor of the mainland
system-into the secret wilson was now
more convinced than ever that he had his
man but he was determined to get complete
proof before he made a charge

  why im pretty well-pretty well said
blander hesitatingly  you see i just ar-
rived i am in new york to look into some
of our securities

  the caught culprit always blunders by be-
ginning to make false excuses

  they must be a source of trouble to a
man who has as much on his mind as you
replied wilson with all the calmness of a
most disinterested acquaintance

  yes they are a good deal of trouble
but they constitute a large part of our busi-
ness and must be taken care of but what-
but what brings you to new york 

   oh answered wilson  i am here on a
little business of my own i have an old aunt
living here that i have wanted to visit ever
since my father died i promised him that
i would come to new york some day when i
had a chance and calpn her and as it is the
first time that i have ever been here i thought
that i would take a few days off and see some
of the sights

  pretty big place said blander seem-
ingly satisfied that all was right

    yes said wilson  its the biggest city
that i have ever seen a man could get lost
here and no one would know it

  wilson did not intend that there should
be anything significant in this remark he
was not looking straight into blanders face
when he uttered it if hehad he would have
noticed a peculiar reddish glow appear just
under the eyes

  their conversation was interrupted by a
bell-boy who said politely but with all the
shrill fervor of his youthful voice

   shall i take your bag to your room mr
clivers  

  blander caught the boy before he had time
to finish the sentence just as the lad was
uttering the  clivers blander quickly an-
swered 

  yes yes of course 

  but wilsons keen ears had caught it
naught else was needed to create any doubt

blander was undoubtedly the thief who had
stolen the funds of the mainland system

  all wilson had to do then and there was
to call tom tracie and make his charge but
-he was going to get his proofs first men
like blander must be caught with the goods

   you must excuse me i am tired and
must go to my room and blander extended
his hand in a formal farewell wilson took
it a good detective will always equal if not
exceed his quarry in politeness

  blander did not have to give himself-away
further-much to his solace the shrill-
voiced bell-boy was in waiting with bag and
key and with his well-developed dignity
escorted the magnate to the elevator-door and
called out the number of his room

   blander lived on the seventh floor in suite
 almost directly over the room that wil-
son occupied

  arriving at the seventh floor he was met
by another boy who insisted on carrying his
bag but blander was in no mood now for any
sort of attention

  on the journey up in die elevator some-
thing told him-some sinister spirit and his
own black conscience-that all was not well

  once he caught sight of himself in the
mirrors that walled the car and he was star-
tled at his own countenance

  he knew that he looked apoplectic and he
knew also that a sudden fright accentuated
its symptoms his face was flushed and
burning the conversation with wilson had
not done him any good his heart was
throbbing and his breath was coming short

  he was thoroughly frightened

  so he brushed the bell-boy aside roughly
and insisted on carrying his bag himself

  when he reached the door of suite llt he
paused on its threshold for a few moments
he wanted to gather his senses before he en-
tered it would not do for meriel to see
him in an excited state he must be calm

  he drew his hand across his face it was
still moist with perspiration taking his
handkerchief lie wiped it away

 then he shook himself as if it was possible
for a man to shake off the thing that is most
occupying his mind just as a dog shakes off
the water when it efnerges from a pond

  mustering up courage he entered meriel
was seated in a large easy chair whiling away
the time with a novel

   ah john she said back again

  there was not much of good cheer or wel-
come in her voice there never can be where
there is no love

   yes meriel here i am blanders tone
president of the line



was also that of the peevish bored-to-deatli
man

  he did not even kiss her he removed his
outer coat and without further parley said

   you must excuse me for a while dear i
have had some terrible business reverses to-
day-and my head is aching badly ring
for a whisky-and-soda  am going to rest
for a while

  he entered the bedroom and without re-
moving a stitch fell on the bed burying
his face in his hands he began to think

  think he did-good and hard-as a man
can only think when he has done that which
is dishonest and when his conscience tells
him that he is in danger of being found out

  blander felt that he was in a trap-that
the meshes were being drawn around him
tighter and tighter

  although vincent wilson had not given
the slightest clue that he entertained the
smallest suspicion yet something told him
that there was danger lurking near he was
convinced of it his bark was close to the
rocks

  and so he thought and his thoughts
burned deep into his brain

  he must find a way out of it

   i must i must  he said almost out
loud i must i cannot let these fellows
expose me and wind up in disgrace-or-
my god-jail 

  there was the account for steel rails that
he had so deftly manipulated for several
years by auditing fake orders for thou-
sands of tons of steel rails for branch roads
he had turned a nice sum into his own pocket

  there was the account for coal by the
duplicate bills of the central america coal
corporation he had charged up thousands
of tons that the mainland system never pur-
chased-and the price had gone to him

  there was the account for lubricating oil-

   here is your whisky-and-soda dear
meriel interrupted his reverie but blander
did not move he wanted her to think that
he was asleep-and he made good his point
meriel imagined that he was asleep she
placed the beverage on the table and tiptoed
out of the room

  he waited until she had probably seated
herself again and he jumped off the bed and
swallowed the liquor it was his intention
to order more and drown his feelings in
drink but his better self told him that he
needed all his will-power should anything
happen

  he thought a while longer and then meriel
came to him she reminded him that it was

nine oclock and that she had not had any
dinner

  he too was getting hungry but the
thought of going down to the dining-room
was too much for him

  he could not eat if he saw wilson again
he suggested that they order something to be
sent up to their rooms meriel was willing

  in her heart she somewhat feared the man
she had married him for his money-nothing
more-and women who marry men for their
money generally become as subdued as tabby-
cats on a hearth-rug

  but blander was frightened-purely and
unqualifiedly frightened

  there he was registered at the continental
as bertrand clivers-the name that he was
known by in new york-and there was a
man in the same hotel who knew him inti-
mately by his right name-stephen blander

  in new york bertrand clivers the emi-
nent promoter and capitalist supposed to
be worth millions in louisville stephen
blander assistant auditor of the mainland
system with a salary of five thousand dollars
a year bachelor churchman and conserva-
tive business man

  he had kept it up so successfully all these
years no one had found him out perhaps
no one had found him out now perhaps the
meeting with wilson was only a coincidence
and besides who was wilson that he could
do the assistant auditor any harm 

  pshaw it was only a coincidence after
all wilson had probably only spoken to him
because he was a stranger in a big city and
was looking for company that was all
after dinner he and meriel would go down-
town to some gay cafe and he would meet
some of the men whom he knew in wall
street and forget it

  the dinner was served and eaten in silence
and when blander started for the gay cafe
and the wall street friends he changed his
mind

  he was scared-just clean scared he
could not help thinking of wilson and
shortly after meriel had retired for the night
he went to the telephone called up the office
and in as cheerful a voice as possible asked
if mr vincent wilson of louisville was
staying at the hotel

  yes replied the clerk do you wish
to speak to him

  no-o responded blander he grabbed
the telephone-box to keep himself from fall-
ing he staggered across the room and
blindly aimed for a chair

  suddenly the room began to reel the


the railroad mans magazine

blood rushed in a seething flood to his brain
and seemed to blind him he tried to call to
his wife but he only choked

  meriel found him on the floor where he
had fallen without a moments loss she
called to the office for a doctor and not satis-
fied that the house physician was hurrying as
fast as possible she searched the telephone-
book for other doctors in the neighborhood
and called them too

  the house-physician arrived and with the
aid of a bell-boy lifted blander to a chair
restoratives soon brought him around the
other doctors who had been summoned soon
appeared and added to the clinic the con-
sensus of opinion was that their distinguished
patient had a stroke of apoplexy they add-
ed that it was nothing serious-

   still said an eminent medico in ex-
plaining the matter to meriel  it is just as
well to be careful that there is no second at-
tack you should insist that your husband
go away with you for a change he should
not think of business for a month he ate
a heavy dinner to-night and was shocked
probably by some bad news he heard

   our american business men work too
hard for their own good he added for good
measure in sentiment

  yes interrupted the unruffled meriel
poor bertrand has been working awfully
hard of late

  one young doctor who had been sum-
moned found a chance for a bit of adverti-
sing so he called up the newspaper offices and
told how he had been suddenly called in to
attend  the eminent financier mr bertrand
clivers and that is why all connected with
the affair were surprised to see it displayed
on the front pages the next morning

chapter xi

the man in 

hen blander left wilson and started
up in the elevator to his rooms as
told in the preceding chapter wilson crossed
the lobby to where tom tracie and jimmie
winters were sitting

  well said tracie as wilson took a
chair  i see that you got your man

  how do you know asked wilson with
a smile

    i could tell it by the expression that came
into his face the moment you spoke to him
it is an old failing of humanity the face
frequently tells more than the voice it takes
a pretty old and hardened criminal to

get away with it i have seen a man try to
control his face using all the power that he
could summon but there are some little mus-
cles that cannot be kept in leash yes wil-
son i had my eye glued to mr-whats his
name-blander when you spoke to him and
ill stake my professional career that you
have the right man

   i think that i have answered wilson

  are you going to do anything now
asked the detective

  no replied the young man i dont
think that he suspects anything if i take
any steps now he may crawl through some
loophole i want to catch him with the goods
on

  first i will run over to louisville and
see our president and tell him what has hap-
pened i want to ask you if you wont report
this matter to your chief and ask him to let
you keep an eye on blander and report what
he does while he is in new york just keep
him under surveillance if our president
wants him arrested i will advise you by wire
and you can go ahead however i think
that lie will agree with me that it is best to
grab him red-handed

   you can count on me replied tracie
 i am as good as on the case now all that
i have to do is to tell the chief what has hap-
pened this night and that it is the wish of
your road that i shall be assigned to shadow
your man and you can sleep easy that i am
on the job and if our friend winters here
he added laying a kindly hand on jimmies
knee  wants to learn something about sleuth-
ing in a big city he can come along with
me

  jimmie was willing the affair had ex-
cited him it gave him an insight into a
phase of life which he had believed could
only exist in the minds of romancers

  vincent wilson had decided to take the
first train for louisville and tell president
jones what had happened but on further
consideration he decided that he would not
plunge into the case too deeply

- on advice of tom tracie who agreed with
him that it would be best to nab the man
 with the goods he sent the wire telling
president jones that he had a clue and would
be home in a few days

   if you rush at jones with this he may
want the man arrested without delay said
the detective let us follow him around for
a day or so and see what he does then you
can carry the news to louisville

  they agreed finally on this plan they
were to meet at the hotel in the morning and
president of the line



wait until blander had his breakfast then
jimmie and vincent were to go to the latters
room while tracie who was an adept at fol-
lowing a man would trail blander

   if he found that the financier was engaging
in anything that might be used as evidence
against himself tracie was to telephone to
the continental and the other men would
join him

  but their plan met a sickening halt when
on the next morning each read on the front
page of his paper the story of blanders apo-
plectic stroke

  each laughed heartily at the sympathetic
tone of the attending doctors remarks in an
interview stating that the terrible manner
in which eminent business men of to-day in-
jure their health by so constant an application
to business mr cliverss sudden attack the
pill-prescriber further said  should be a les-
son to other of our great financiers not to over-
tax their brains with business details

  blander did not leave his bed that day
the three mer watched closely but there was
no sign of the auditor of the mainland sys-
tem or his pretty wife blander was advised
by a physician to keep quiet for several days
that he was willing to do but he could only
keep his body quiet

  the mind-the seat of the great complex
system that controls the human body-was ill
at ease blander could not keep it quiet he
tried to blind it to the things that were upper-
most in it but it would not be blinded

  his past arose to smite him he thought
that he was sufficiently clever to keep it
asleep so that it would never disturb him
but now it had been aroused by the most fatal
enemy that man has ever known-fear-and
it stood before him a mighty mountain that
seemed impossible to cross

  four years ago he took the first wrong
step with the mainland people that was
when he represented to the company that its
repair work could be done cheaper by an in-
dependent concern than in its own shops

  his figures were so plausible that his su-
perior officers agreed with him then he
formed a conspiracy with an equipment com-
pany and  pulled down  nearly forty thou-
sand dollars before he stopped-and he only
stopped because his partner in the criminal
transaction was afraid to go any further

  then blander thought of the overcharges
that he foisted through on false vouchers
every time that he was short and needed ready
coin then the whole system of black and
iniquitous graft that he hadput in operation
danced before him

  great scott but it was hideous-hideous
beyond the dream of a fiend

  it had all been so easy-it had given him
so much money-a position in the financial
world-but now it was a reeking loathsome
menace that he could never destroy

  he would have given every cent of the dis-
honest gains if-but it was too late

  fear had him in her clutch he was a
coward and he knew it if he had been
stronger-stronger and more fearless so that
he could face the world and snap his fingers
at wilson and any other man who might ac-
cuse him-but he was simply a coward a
moral low-down coward

  these were the thoughts that flashed
through the unfortunate mans brain as his
trained nurse flitted hither and yon in her
untiring effort to administer to his every wish
and his wife sat in the parlor of their suite
reading away the hours and dreadfully bored
that the conventionality of such a case kept
a society woman from lifes enjoyments

chapter xii

his black beast

tt dawned upon tom tracie as the day
wore on that it would be a good plan to
telephone to blanders rooms and find out
just how he was

  tracie said that he would do this under
the guise of an old friend so the three men
walked down fifth avenue to another hotel
and with tom tracie as the spokesman
were soon in connection with the sick mans
room

  is this mr cliverss room asked
tracie

  the trained nurse answered the call and
she replied that mr clivers was in but was
suffering from a severe illness

    so i read in the papers said the detec-
tive with a tremor of sadness in his voice

 i am an old friend and i was anxious to
find out if mr clivers is in a serious way

  not at all replied the nurse the
doctor says that he must stay in bed for about
a week and then go away to rest up we
are sure that he will be much better to-mor- i
row but he will be unable to see any one for
several davs shall i tell him who asked for
him

  just say mr jones said tracie taking
a long chance and hanging up the receiver

  it was evident then that vincent wilson
could be of little use in new york for a day
or so and he arranged to leave for louisville

	rr


the railroad mans magazine

on the first fast train tracie would be on
constant watch and jimmie would be close
to tracie

  harvey jones w-as a surprised railroad
president when he heard wilsons story

  the two men had gone to the presidents
club for luncheon there they could be quiet
-no one would break in on the recital of the
awful expose

  president jones listened to the character
of one of his most trusted officers being slowly
torn to pieces-an idol that he had placed
on the pedestal of honor being shattered
piece by piece

   are you sure   he asked finally

   ill stake my life on it replied vincent
wilson

   your enthusiasm to run this matter to
earth hasnt got the best of you asked the
president

   i would kill myself before i would ac-
cuse a man falsely said wilson  and to
prove that i am right i ask you not to take
any action until we have him where we can
bring the proofs of our suspicions right to
his face

  president tones did not answer for a mo-
ment he seemed to be terribly depressed
the fact that blander was a traitor had un-
nerved him

   i never thought that of blander he
finally said to me he was always the
soul of honor  you can never judge a book
by its cover

   or a dog by his bark added wilson

  what is your plan asked the presi-
dent

   i shall wait here until i hear from
tracie then i will take the first train to
new york if we find that blander changes
his plan and decided to come to louisville
then i will remain here i should prefer
that he comes here while i am certain that
he is operating in new york under another
name it will be more to our advantage to
catch him here

  were he arrested in new york he might
fight extradition and get away and we want

to be c

 to land him  wilson brought his fist down
 on the table with so much vehemence that
 the president was starded and then wilson
 realizing that he had overstepped the limits
 in a gentlemans club apologized

    you are pretty positive in your charges
 said the president  why do you seem so
 vindictive 

    i am only doing this for the good of you
 and the road he replied if i am wrong
 i will resign my position and you can fire a
 loaded pistol at my head

   several days passed and there were no
 developments wilson did not hear any-
 thing from tracie so he wired him

   the detective answered that blander had
 not left his room and sent a note by the night
 mail that he had telephoned as  friend
 jones several times and was told that the
 patient w-as getting on nicely and would be
 out and down-town soon

   but the patient was still thinking he had
 it firmly established on his mind now that
 there was something in the air-that he was
 being suspected and that sooner or later he
 would be brought to face his awful past

   he must do all in his feeble power to pre-
 vent it

   w ilson was the man who knew-the man
 who would be his dark shadow wilson
 would dig into his books and accounts until
 he found a vital spot and then-it would be
 all over wilson would keep at it until he
 could find an opening and then strike-and
 it would happen soon

   so there is only one thing to do thought
 blander get wilson out of the way

   but how

   he must be killed  yes wilson must be
 murdered sandbagged drowned-he didnt
 care only wilson must be put out of the

 way

   that would be his first duty when he was
 on his feet again

  he slept better that night

   wilson must be put out of the wray he
 would pay to have it done he knew where
 to find men who would do the trick

matters of vital interest which show that the railroads of the world are
keeping pace with the rush and advance of
modern industry

wireless telegraphy on the u p

the union pacific railroad lias commenced the
installation of a system of wireless telegraphy
along its road says the railway and engineering
review a powerful station already has been estab-
lished at omaha nebraska capable of communi-
cating with the smaller stations along the line and
towers will be erected now at sydney nebraska and
cheyenne wyoming

  the work of installation is under the direction of
dr frederick h millener experimental electrician
of the union pacific railroad who left omaha this
week to supervise the erection of the stations at the
places mentioned they will be finished and put
in operation as soon as possible the first work of
the towers will be to facilitate railroad telegraph
business during wind and snow storms and later
on efficient communication with moving trains

  dr millener has been conducting experiments at
the union pacific shops in omaha for nearly four
years and the new installation is the result of these
investigations

  miles of electrification

in an address made recently by professor john
w whitehead of johns hopkins university
it was pointed out that out of the two hundred
and twenty thousand miles of railroad in this
country only a thousand miles as yet have been
electrified attention was called to the fact that
the electrification of the elevated railroads of new
york city resulted in increasing the capacity of the
roads fifty per cent suburban express and freight
services all seem to improve under electrification
and it is always possible



largest plant ever moved

at the cost of a small fortune a giant palm fifty
feet high when in the ground twenty feet in
circumference at the base and weighing forty tons
in its case has been moved from the w j dingee
estate at redwood city california to santa cruz

  the palm was first cut out of the earth without
disturbing the dirt around the roots more than ab-
solutely necessary as a large frame or box resem-

bling the uncompleted first story of a large frame
house was built around dirt roots and trunk the
palm was slowly moved to the railroad tracks as a
house is moved on rollers and lifted to the flat cars
with powerful derricks

another railroad motor car

the independent gasoline-driven railroad motor-
car is still growing in favor a new car sev-
enty feet in length recently left the shops at omaha
for the buffalo rochester and pittsburgh railroad
this is the seventy-fourth car of the type to be
turned out from these shops and it is the sixth car
to be built for service east of the mississippi river

explains abc block system

alfred beamer formerly superintendent
of the idaho division of the northern pacific
railroad is now devoting his time to extending the
use of the abc block system of train-despatch-
ing of which he and t h langtry trainmaster of
the northern pacific in spokane are inventors and
patentees on lines in various parts of the united
states canada and mexico

  the device is a reversal of the system now in
use throughout the country instead of the train-
despatcher calling up the operators and giving them
orders the new system requires the operators to ask
for orders it has been used on the idaho division
of the northern pacific road the last three years
and no defects have been discovered thus far

   take three stations designated a b and c
said mr beamer in explaining the plan to the
railroad mans magazine

   when a train pulls out of a going in the direc-
tion of b the operator at a notifies the operator at
b that the train has passed his station the operator
at b then calls the despatcher and asks for a block-
card from p to c if the block shows clear on the
despatchers sheet he gives b instructions to issue a
block-card

   before the train leaves b the operator al that
station calls the operator at c and asks him to
pledge the block between their stations if the
block is busy the operator refuses to pledge it and
immediately calls the despatcher
gs

the railroad mans magazine

   no train can pass a station without first re-
ceiving its block-card and instructions are issued to
trainmen from station to station collision is im-
possible unless of course the three men make the
same mistake at the same time



larger locomotives

the ever-increasing weight of western passen-
ger-trains is being met by a steady growth in
the size and power of the locomotives the chi-
cago milwaukee and st paul have recently turned
out of their shops two types of six-coupled simple
locomotives with cylinders twenty-three inches by
twenty-eight inches one of which has seventy-nine-
inch drivers and a tractive effort of  pounds
and the other sixty-nine-inch drivers and a tractive
effort of  pounds

railroad has trees to give away

the detroit and mackinac railway has for the
last five years experimented with a forestry
nursery on its tawas beach property and at the
present time has on hand trees of the following kinds
for transplanting white pine scotch pine west-
ern yellow pine spruce and western white cedar
the company desires to dispose of these trees and
will give them to parties who will plant them and
see that they are properly taken care of

  the only charge made will be the expense of
packing and freight charges from east tawas to
destination the company especially requests that
farmers on and adjacent to the line of the detroit
and mackinac railway make requisitions for these
trees for reforesting some of the lands that they
have cut over on their farms

another fast mail train

by a new arrangement of schedules on the penn-
sylvania missouri pacific and santa fe rail-
roads a letter can now be sent from new york to
los angeles california in three days sixteen hours
and fifteen minutes

  this is a gain over the old schedule of about
eleven hours or nearly half a day this is another
instance which shows how thankful the american
public should be to the air-brake

a smokeless locomotive

the world is waiting for a smokeless locomo-
tive and one burning bituminous coal has
been developed in chicago says the springfield re-
publican a group of railroad men and members
of the smoke committees from several cities recent-
ly saw the  doylair smokeless locomotive draw a-
train of cars from the stock-yards in chicago a
distance of twenty-eight miles without any display
of smoke or gas and with but little firing necessary

  it is claimed that the device on the locomotive
produces something like perfect combustion and
thereby effects a saving in fuel consumption of be-
tween thirty-five and sixty per cent this seems
almost too good to be true and yet there is no in-
herent impossibility in the claim made the fact
that the outsiders who witnessed the demonstration
were greatly impressed by it is most encouraging

  this ought to be the beginning of a determined
public demand that this smokeless device be used
on all locomotives to the speedy retirement of the
smoke-emitting nuisances that not only detract from
the pleasure of traveling but sadly pollute the air

  it will be a great triumph for civilization when
results like those produced in this chicago experi-
ment have become commonplace

new santa fe engines successful

the giant freight-engine no  built for the
santa fe by the baldwin locomotive works
and described in our march issue is now at work
on the los angeles division and giving excellent
satisfaction her run is over the twenty-six-mile
hill from san bernardino to summit which runs

a car for invalids

america has given europe many valuable
ideas for the promotion of comfort and con-
venience in railroad travel this country first
used sleeping-cars and dining-cars occasionally
however other countries return the compliment by
setting the united states an example worth follow-
ing

  on one of the english lines the great northern
a special car has been provided for persons who are
ill or have been injured by accident and can afford
to pay for these exceptional accommodations while
traveling at one end of the car are two toilet-
rooms at the other end are two small compart-
ments with narrow passageways or corridors along
the side

  the central portion of the coach is spacious and
resembles a large parlor though it has long couches
and a bed for use at night there is room enough
for two or three armchairs and exceptionally large
windows afford a fine view of the country by day
during the hours of darkness the car is lighted by
electricity portable tables for meals and card-
playing are stored out of sight

  though the car is meant chiefly for an invalid
and the two or three companions whom a sick per-
son would be sure to have it can also be employed
as a parlor-car for a small party of travelers steam
heat when necessary rich carpets and elegant up-
holstery add further to the attractiveness of the
car-new york tribune farmer

                      i

             by katharine eggleston

           a bouquet two traveling bags a joke and some
           other things play their parts in this romance

   y v oo-too-to-toot too-too-
            too-toot 

  ii i ill ilk it was an imitation of brass
 jq i qt band and orchestra combined
 meant to suggest the impres-
 sive strains of the wedding
 march the performer held a big bunch of
 bridevroses high above his head to keep the
 appalling length of white ribbon from sweep-
 ing the platform

    a riotous volley of laughter greeted his ap-
 pearance

   the girl who was stirring up the excite-
 ment stood in the center of the group her eyes
 shining and her lips parted over her pretty
 teeth

   they were giving her the kind of send-off
 the most popular girl of the house-party
 ought to have particularly when she has the
 discretion to leave just as there begins to be
 a pressureon other girls toes and an uncer-
 tainty about the anchorage of other girls
 beaus

   jimmie linn presented his bouquet with a
flourish just as the train came in he seized
all the luggage about-two alligator bags
and umbrella-and went into the pullman

   by processes the girl detached herself
 from her friends while a would-be passen-
 ger waited to mount the steps she occupied

    at length she went in carrying her tell-tale
 bouquet and followed by the patient pas-
 senger

  there you are jimmie announced as
he set her umbrella up in the corner

   all aboard  followed by a chorus of
warning from his friends came from outside

  he seized the girls hand

   good luck happiness all the cream 
he shouted amiably

  then he plunged toward the door the
other passenger stood in the aisle a climax
to his joke suggested itself he grabbed the
surprised mans hand

  youre the lucky man all right all
right he said frantically wringing the
hand he had captured while the porter and
the other travelers grinned appreciatively at
the bridegroom

  then having done as much mischief as
the time allowed jimmie fell off the train

  gertrude fearon sank limply into her seat
the ridiculous bouquet cavorted into the
aisle

  the bridegroom with a hardened face
bolted toward the smoking-room leaving the
porter to render the service he should have
delighted in

   heahs youah bouquet madam joe said
shoving the terrible trophy into gertrudes
unwilling hands

   im not- she was beginning when the
conductor appeared and waked her to the
real extent of her difficulty

the railroad mans magazine

a groom who flagrantly deserted to leave his
bride to face the idle curiosity and the con-
ductor alone

   i-i have my ticket gertrude said
hurriedly as the conductor started away

 its a pass

  she took it from her purse with trem-
bling fingers if only she need not use it
if she had not counted on it and spent almost
all her money except enough for the small
expenses of her trip

  mrs lucien wallace the conductor re-
peated as he made the record

  the words sounded like a knell to ger-
trude she had accepted the pass with such
delight when mrs wallace offered it
unable to profit herself by the transporta-
tion that came to her husband from adver-
tising the railroads in his paper she insisted
on gertrude making use of the privilege

  now this very pass made it next to im-
possible to explain that she was not a bride
and that the flowers and congratulations were
a joke she would merely substitute one un-
truth for another for the pass forced her to
be mrs lucien wallace

  the fright that seized her at the thought of
coolly tearing down the defense of the pass
convince her that she would arouse suspicion

  it did occur to her to send for the man and
ask him to agree to the misunderstanding till
she reached chicago where she changed
trains but her pride shrank at throwing
herself on the mercy of a stranger he might
presume might act up to the role into which
jimmie linn had thrust him

  she would trust to luck appealing to
him might be defending the pass at too great
a cost

  meanwhile the man was busy wondering
how he was to get his bag

  the conductor and joe interrupted him

   mr wallace the conductor began geni-
ally

  my names not wallace the supposed
bridegroom objected

  joe grinned he knew the kind of brides
and grooms who try to hide themselves os-
trichlike under disguises that cover only their
own heads

   i want your ticket madam the conduc-
tor said retiring from affability to profes-
sional brevity

  the man who denied the name of wallace
because his name was foster handed it over
the fact that his ticket was to chicago the
first change that must be made in the trip
that gertrudes pass indicated did nothing
to destroy the bride-and-groom theory

  porter get my handbag its the alli-
gator leather where the-the lady with the
roses is sitting he said slipping a mollify-
ing quarter into joes black hand

  joe went on his errand marveling at the
ways of the newly wed

  he made up his mind that they had out-
lined a course of deception but he knew that
the first step had been balked they had
been caught and overwhelmed with the usual
attentions except the rice for which he was
duly grateful but it looked like the kind
of foolishness common to brides and grooms
for them to be keeping it up after the cat was
out of the bag

   the bride had left her seat when he reached
it-and the roses were gone too

   joe faced the difficulty of two alligator bags
exactly alike even his eyes trained to ob-
serve the tale-tell ing of the small belongings
of travelers could not decide which bag was
the brides and which the grooms

   ef ah wuz to git de wrong one
twouldnt make no real diffunce he thought
laying hold of one

  the groom merely nodded when joe set
the bag down beside him and departed

  presently gertrude reappeared-without
the roses

  they were lying in the middle of the
track a long way behind the flying train

  the pullman conductor took gertrudes
berth ticket with no very flattering reflection
on the kind of a groom who could leave the
details of the great tour to his bride

  joe confided to him that the groom was a
 grouch and the conductor did not approach
him if he meant to be disagreeable and
leave his bride in full possession of the seat
it was his affair

  the sympathy of the two conductors and
joe went out to the pretty bride they ad-
dressed her as  mrs wallace as they in-
quired about her comfort the blood leaped
into her face at every repetition of the name
it was shame at the lie she was acting that
dyed her cheeks

  she was just beginning to be comfortable
to cease to watch the door for the appearance
of the husband who had been thrust upon
her or the conductor who might take up her
pass when the train stopped at a station where
another road crossed the main line

  a crowd waited for the incoming train
gertrudes eyes roved from one to another-
to encounter a new dilemma this was six
feet tall

  it was colin mcmillin

  staring over the heads about him his
defending the tass



glance encountered iters she saw him
change countenance as if he recognized but
could hardly believe that he actually saw her

  her heart seemed to stop for an instant
he was making his way with center-rush
vigor toward the car if he came in it would
be with his characteristic vim he would
greet her as miss fearon and his big voice
would assail the ears of the men in whose
hands her fate and the fate of her pass rested

  they would be waked to suspect that the
groom in the smoking-room had reasons for
avoiding the bride in the car they might
go to him and ask the questions that she was
sure they had not advanced

  there was but one course open to her
she must forget in the few minutes before
mcmillin could appear beside her that she
had ever known him when he came in she
would-

  the door swung in and-he was there
he came rushing along the aisle with an
eagerness that proved his memory better than
hers for as he stumbled over a suit-case in
the way she turned casually and looked at
him then quite as if the stumbling stran-
ger had no further interest for her she turned
her glance out the window

  mcmillin paused for a second overcome
with surprise then with uncertainty and con-
fusion written large on his face he went on
through the car

  gertrude breathed a long sigh that was
over but somehow the relief she should
have felt did not come to her

  mcmillin met the conductor

   hallo warren  he said  do you
happen to know the name of the lady the
young one with the light hair she looks
like a girl i once knew

  the conductor handed him gertrudes
pass

   humph mrs lucien wallace so
she is married  colin observed as he re-
turned the slip of paper

   im sure i used to know her warren i
think ill find out he continued as he started
back into the car

  better not warren warned shes
got a regular bear-

  but mcmillin was out of hearing he ap-
proached gertrude from behind but with no
effort at stealth indeed there was some-
thing particularly assertive in his bearing

   i beg your pardon but were you miss
gertrude fearon he asked

  gertrude gathered her wits together to
meet the returning dilemma

  why-oh mr mcmillin she ex-

claimed looking up at him with the brown
eyes that had made him tractable on other
occasions

  did you just go through the car she
continued with an air of puzzled inquiry
that would have worked with any one less de-
cidedly in favor of seeing things as they real-
ly were than as a very pretty woman wished
them to seem

  yes i did he answered moving her
luggage and making a place for himself op-
posite her  and you cut me purposely
because you thought it would be kinder or
because you didnt want to be bothered with
me

   i-i wasnt sure gertrude stammered

   vou didnt want to be he asserted
 but it is i you see i wasnt going to
let you forget me

  he had always roused gertrudes resist-
ance they had quarreled at the end of the
visit she had made to his home town over a
year before perhaps she felt the mastery
that reached out and sought to claim her and
steeled herself against it because she feared
its strength and charm

   tell me about-him he directed when
she was silent

  you tell me first where you are going
she fenced

  that doesnt matter he replied but
ill tell im going home so hurry up
its the second stop from here

  but gertrude seemed inclined to make
haste slowly

  arent you going to describe him he
urged

  who she asked

  your husband of course he grumbled

  how did you know she inquired

   saw your pass he replied

  the brevity of his answers and the grim-
ness of his face made gertrude eager to find
out just about how much he had really cared
about her if this desire had not seized her
she would very probably have told him of
the embarrassing predicament in which she
found herself and have had him go to the
man in the smoking-room with overtures of
arbitration but she cared so much to know

  well he is tall and- she began

  whats his business colin asked prac-
tically

   he-why hes a newspaper man ger-
trude answered deciding to use the real mr
wallace as the basis for her husband-build-
ing

  newspaper man why i thought youd
marry money colin said mentally cross-


the railroad mans magazine

ing out one of the obstacles he had thought
stood in his way

    you must think im a poor sort of girl 
 gertrude exclaimed turning the blazing
 brown eyes toward him

    maybe i just thought you wanted what
 it seemed to me you ought to have he
 amended meekly  well-what else  

   hes tall- she began again finding
 her imagination unequal to the task

     you said that dont rub it in  he ob-
 jected while he added an item in his favor on
 the credit side then gloomily reflected that
 it was too late to make use of it now

    and he is dark gertrude paused look-
 ing at the brown head across from her

    the description might apply to you
 she said putting her head on one side and
 studying him critically

    it might but it doesnt worse luck 
 he said regretfully

   no gertrude agreed finding a wicked
 joy in watching his deepening despondency

     it must have been rather a sudden affair 
 he said after a considerable pause

   yes it was-very really unexpected
 gertrude assented with a cheerfulness that
 cut

   happiness thrust upon you he said
 bitterly

    ye-es gertrude assented

   you are happy he demanded savage-
 ly dont make it worse-that way

   evidently the conductor had not ex-
  plained that she was on her bridal trip she
 prayed that the man in the smoking-room
 would not appear

   id never know a moments peace-if i
 thought-you were unhappy  he continued
 with such fervor that gertrude thought she
 must prove her delight at her situation by
 launching into a description of the man who
 had won her

   she made him such a wonder of mankind
 that mcmillin sat listening to her with un-
 regenerate hate and jealousy turning his being
 bitter

     of course you have his picture he said
 in a pause of her eulogy

   gertrude knew that any woman so lately
 married and raving so ecstatically about her
 life-partner would have his picture in her
 traveling-bag

   she must pretend to look for it only to
 discover with tender regret that she had not
 put it among her things

   mcmillin lifted the bag on the seat for
  her she plunged her hand into it expecting
  to feel futilely among the knickknacks and

feminine apparel for the picture that was not
there

  but her hand struck sharply against the
heel of a shoe-a big shoe with a large and
assertive heel

   why this is not my bag  she exclaimed

  not your bag mcmillin asked all in-
terest

  then it flashed across her mind that she
had noticed the likeness in the two valises
that jimmie had put in the section she
guessed at the exchange that had been made
but she must explain to mcmillin

  oh its all right i understand now
she said laughing  jimmie has put some-
thing in my bag just for a joke

  the prevarication had scarcely left her
lips when she saw joe approaching with the
twin valise

   youah husban in de smokin-room
wants his bag ah done tuk him de wrong
one madam said joe

  colin stared at her with every line in his
face settling to stiff rage she shoved the
bag to joe

   is your husband with you   mcmillin
asked with icy calm

  gertrude glanced over her shoulder she
must explain but she did not choose to lose
out now by telling the conductors about it

  ill explain you see- she began

  a blue uniform appeared in the car and
bore down upon them

  your stop mr mcmillin said war-
ren

  all right warren thanks colin an-
swered as he rose

  he bade gertrude good-by and hurried
away

  he ran against the unwilling groom in the
vestibule

   hallo mac where are you going  he
asked with a delight that found no reflection
in colins face

   i havent decided mcmillin replied his
mind divided between a straight and narrow
path to gehenna or the dull way to his own
home

   come on to chicago with me ive ta-
ken a trip-lease on the smoking-room was
fosters invitation

  the smoking-room gertrude fearons
husband was in there he would look him
over

  ill do it foster he decided

  mcmillin looked curiously at the one man
who with foster was in possession of the
small room he was elderly well-groomed-
and rather distinguished in appearance he
defending the pass



could understand why a young girl might not
care to have the elderly husband and the
youthful lover meet perhaps she had mar-
ried for money after all maybe that was
the reason she had been so strenuous in her
resentment of his words

  look here mac im in a hole foster
grumbled some idiot when i got on the
train just behind a pretty girl congratulated
me she had a big bunch of brides roses-
so we were spotted as bride and groom and

i	dont know her from the first eve in the
original garden

    theres only one pretty girl in the car
mcmillin commented absently

  shes it-the bride-and im the groom
drat it wont i feel good when lily and the
kid met me at the station  

  you mean that say what do you
mean colin asked waking to the fact
that there were matters of interest outside of
his own thoughts

  oh i know what i mean all right
foster exclaimed  but what does she
mean  

  how colin questioned

   i happen to know that she isnt married
at all at least i heard one of the men who
came to see her off call her miss fearon
colin focused his attention on foster

   and the conductor calls her mrs wal-
lace and they all call me mr wallace
what do you think of that  

  why dont you ask her- colin sug-
gested

    havent i been sitting here for hours ex-
pecting her to send for me under the cir-
cumstances i hate to go to her and run the
risk of a throw-down ive come to the con-
clusion shes working some con game if
she is the distance i keep from her is going
to be some if it was all straight shed have
sent for me and untangled me from this
matrimonial twist-up

  colin could not explain but his convic-
tion that foster was wrong grew as the evi-
dence to prove his theory was offered

  oh shes all right he asserted posi-
tively

  just judging from appearance youre
correct but i tell you i hear the loose
screw rattling foster insisted

   you are sure the man called her miss
fearon mcmillin asked

   double sure he did it several times in
my hearing said foster

  colin rose abruptly he did not stop to
excuse his going to foster he hurried into
the car

  gertrude saw him vanish through a mist
of tears

  she had believed that she had destroyed
the last chance at what seemed a beautiful
possibility by her double-dealing when the
possibility presented itself beside her

   look here gertie colin began ruth-
lessly sweeping aside small conventions
 whats the matter  

  i thought-you got off-

   i didnt please answer me tell me
whats wrong   and he took her hand in
both of his

  oh dont what will they think
gertrude whispered watching for the con-
ductors

    i wont let you go till you tell me  colin
insisted  have you a husband  

  no i have a pass she wailed

  do you want one colin asked

   mercy no this one is bad enough i
never want another she cried it has
mrs wallaces name on it i had to pretend
that i was married and that man-

   i mean do you want a husband   colin
asked a second time keeping intently to the
main issue

  gertrude had become habituated to think-
ing of her pass above all else it cried out
now for protection if she told this big man
the truth he would embrace her before any
one who happened to be looking and the
whole fantastic fortification she had built
would be dashed to ruins

   i-i havent any real use for a husband
she temporized

   come out on the platform and ill show
you one he said rising and still holding
her hand forcing her to follow

  well let old foster out of the smoking-
room when we come back mcmillin said
with huge magnanimity

  but foster was picking up his bag to get
off of the train in chicago when they thought
of him again

by dean van der veer

railroad life and the railroad business are pretty serious things but like
all things of great importance they have their lighter humorous side

      mr van der veer while making a trip over the reading got what one
might call some inside side-lights on this humorous side and here he retails them
for the benefit of our readers a half-hour spent on this side of the fence will
be a half-hour well spent come on in

how finens false teeth carved out the destiny of trainman rourke
and a railroad mans adventure in the
wholesale trade

he rose of the reading rail-
road  was an american beau-
ty of the loveliest and rarest
variety she grew up in the
metzler nursery the gardener
being charlie metzler the
official name of this rose of the reading
was rose metzler and the official position
held by her father was that of eastern ship-
ping-agent of the reading railroad at 
commercial wharf boston

  it was that day a year or so ago when a
certain edition of new pennies came out of
the mint at philadelphia that day the
rose of the reading was adorning her fa-
thers office in boston at the address named
above when charlie klink appeared this
is what they said

  she how charlie iclink

  he  how rose wheres your father 

  she  hes gone to find a car-load of your
advertising stuff that seems to have been
abandoned because no one wanted to read it



  he  look rose heres one of the brand-
new pennies just out of the mint i got it this
morning just as i was leaving philadelphia
and i brought it specially for you

  she  thanks a whole lot ill give it to
father hes daft on new pennies collects
em by the ton hell be delighted with this
one

  he no rose you keep that one ill
get another one for your father ill bring it
to him here in about an hour from now

charlie klinks pennies

  and klink went away from there and the
 rose of the reading  continued to adorn
the office of the eastern shipping-agent of the
reading at boston till said agent came in and
was shown the new penny that charlie klink
had brought her fresh from the philadelphia
mint

   and hes gone to get you one of these new
pennies too father she added
light runs on the reading



  he has has he answered father char-
lie metzler picking up his hat and adding
 ill be back before charlie klink returns
rose

  and charlie metzler also went away from
there carrying in his hand be it added an
empty clay flower-pot

  charlie klink was the readings chief
publicity man he had been making things
public about the readingjpr thirty years on
the day in  when given the chieftainship

  then came the day in  when charlie
klink had rounded out thirty years of salary-
gathering from the reading that day again
a drove of his brother officers and gentlemen
of the publicity office and advertising office
and real - estate office swooped down upon
charlie klink as he sat at his desk and
buried him alive in gladioli and filled his
ears with speeches and felicitations and con-
gratulations till charlie klink fell back in
his swivel-chair and just couldnt do any-

got all they had

 i went to the banks and

of the department his friends of die read-
ing in philadelphia informed him that the
rector of his church wished him to come that
evening to the majestic hotel to discuss re-
ligious work

  when charlie klink arrived at the ma-
jestic he was ushered into a dining-room that
was trimmed all over with white chrysanthe-
mums and green asparagus in the middle of
which a table groaned under a burden of nec-
tar and ambrosia while around the board
attired in evening dress sat twenty-five of
charlies reading colleagues it was one
grand merry surprise ha-ha in honor of the
newly appointed chief of the git-it-into-print
factory

thing but choke nearly to death from a sob
that stuck in his throat

  charlie metzlers two specialties were
first new pennies second the history of the
reading he had every incident in the his-
tory of the reading always on the tip of his
tongue for the edification of those who wished
to hear all about it

  once he wrote up a lot of more or less his-
torical reading railroad incidents for a mag-
azine published by the railroad company
called the pilot metzlers little pieces in
the pilot were printed anonymously

  the editor gordon chambers started a
guessing contest forthwith by asking the
reading men to write down their guesses as


the railroad mans magazine

whats finens teeth got to do with that book

to the identity of the author of the stories
every guesser swore that the man who wrote
those articles was one who had personally
participated in the episodes described

  whereat gordon chambers laughed in his
sleeve while charlie metzler smiled out loud
-because every one of the incidents which
charlie metzler had written up had occurred
before ever he had reached the job-accepting
age on the reading or on any other road

  now these two reading boys-charlie
klink and charlie metzler-had both crowd-
ed so much experience into their years of toil
for the reading that each was certain that
the other could hand him nothing new under
the sun each kept ever on the watch-out
therefore lest the other get  one on him

  so when charlie metzler learned from his
daughter that charlie klink had gone away
from there to fetch him back a new penny
he thought he saw through the enemys game
and thats why he too went away from there
to return in about half an hour with a twinkle
in his eyes

  soon after charlie metzlers return to his
office in walked charlie klink in accord-
ance with the threat which he had made

  hallo charlie said klink to metzler

   ive brought you one of the new
  pennies issued to-day

   thats right smart hearty- of
  you charlie said metzler to
  klink

    yes charlie said klink to
  metzler  knowing your weakness
  for new pennies ive brought you
  not one but twenty-five yes sir
  a whole quarters worth had a
  time gettin em too had to scur-
  ry among my politician and bank-
  er friends and get them to use
  their influence at the banks in my
  behalf getting a few of the cop-
  pers here and a few there till
  finally i corralled these twenty-
  five phew it was hot work

 it was mighty enterprising of
you charlie said metzler to
klink  ive collected a lot of
these brand-new pennies of to-
days issue myself-and now ill
just add yours to my collection
while speaking charlie metzler
reached up to the cobwebbed shelf
and took down the clay flower-pot
he shook it now close to the ear
of charlie klink and it sounded
like the jingle of brand-new pen-
nies of that days issue

   you see charlie said metzler to klink
 i didnt know you meant to bring me some
of the new pennies so early this morning i
went to the banks and got all they had-
about five dollars worth thats yhy you
had such a time getting your quarters worth
thanks all the same a numismatic scien-
tist like myself-doesnt mind having five hun-
dred and twenty-five of to-days issue of new
pennies

i	and charlie metzler sat the flower-pot
back on the shelf

  i met charlie klink at the general offices
at the reading terminal in the city of broth-
erly love and he kindly handed the reading
railroad over to me lock stock and barrel

  i forgot to tell klink that this yarn was
fit to print and now that ive blabbed it i
can only pray that when again i reach the
schuylkill we shall still be friends

 by grasshoppers on the track and by trout in
 the boiler and by snakes in the fire-box
 and ive heard of trains bein delayed for
 other reasons miscellaneous but i never be-
 fore heard of a train bein delayed for a gosh-
 dinged set of false teeth sneezed out of a en-
 gineers mouth yes this is the worst ever 
 ive found em yelled theengineer

  ill pull you out now sorry to have delayed
 you haas

   look here finen said the conductor

  ive got to report this delay what excuse
 shall i give

    tell em it was for a whole lot of very
 important reasons to the man running this
 engine answered engineer finen tell

 em this train was delayed because of need-
 ing two molars and four crushers and eight
 grinders and three wisdoms before being able
 to proceed and if that aint enough for a
 report tell em that the engineer of this train
 aint a man to abandon twenty-seven dollars
 worth of eating apparatus to save seven min-
 utes to please any condemned-railroad that
 ever was-see 

  now you who read think this novel ends
right here do you not but it does not end
here theres a sequel what ive narrated
is only part i of the story part ii is a
thriller

dental deduction

   the hero of the second part is a reading
trainman named ed rourke rourke heard
of the catastrophe that had overtaken joe
finen at sellersville station heard of the
sneeze and of the outgoing impetus given to
finens false teeth by that sneeze heard of
the ensuing gravitation of the teeth to earth
and thence by rebound under the engine
and what he heard set trainman rourke to
thinking

   trainman rourkes run was over the phil-
adelphia-new york division suddenly now
rourkes fellow trainmen found that lie no
longer showed up between runs at philadel-
phias moving-picture shows neither did he
come now to the p and r young mens
christian association rooms for games of
checkers it was also noted that rourke had
stopped taking girls to shows altogether it
became manifest that rourke was deliberately
shunning his kind in his off-duty hours

  at last a certain trainman found rourke
in rourkes furnished hall-room poring over
a book which to the visitor looked like a
tome written in greek

  whats that book asked the visiting
trainman

    it represents the result of much concen-
trated thought evolved in my brain an-
swered trainman rourke

 you mean you wrote that book rourke 

  no im merely studying it the con-
centrated thought i spoke of took place in
my brain after hearing about the teeth that
engineer joe finen sneezed out of his
mouth

money in molars

   whats finens teeth got to do with that
book  

  everything supposing finen had not
found those teeth  or supposing they had
been ground to dust under the driving-


the railroad mans magazine

wheels well in that case finen would have
had to buy a new set of teeth would he not
now then i hear that he rated the value
of those teeth at twenty-seven dollars when
i got to doing ray concentrated thinking i
took as my premises the fact that if finen
had lost his teeth beyond recovery the person
who would have supplied him with new teeth
would have been a dentist

   that dentist would have been paid twen-
ty-seven dollars

   from these premises i reached the con-
clusion that there must be a lot more money
in being a dentist than in being a railroad
man im studying to be a dentist

  trainman rourke meant business too he
studied till he passed an examination admit-
ting him to the philadelphia dental college
and then followed months and moons of
more study - always between runs for he
held down his trainman job good and hard all
the time he was burning the midnight elec-
tricity in every off moment he gathered the
honey of learning

  finally rourke got his reward he showed
up at the reading terminal in philadelphia
with two sheepskins one being a diploma
from the philadelphia dental college and
the other a certificate from the pennsylvania
board of regents setting forth the fact that
one edward rourke having qualified as a
dental surgeon was hereby licensed to prac-
tise as a ds

  with these sheepskins in a roll undfr his
arm rourke went to joe finen and said
mr finen supposing you should again
sneeze your teeth out and supposing that you
should not be so fortunate as to find them
what would you do youd go to a dentist
and pay him twenty-seven dollars for a new
set of teeth wouldnt you

a transaction in teeth

  well sir when comes the day of that
sneeze you just patronize one who used to
work on the trains you pulled the same being
myself i wont charge you a cent over forty-
seven dollars for a new set of teeth

   my forty - seven -dollar teeth in your
mouth mr finen will be worth die extra
twenty dollars because theyll fit you so
diat you couldnt sneeze em out with even
a forty-horse-power sneeze

  ed answered finen ill be your first
customer or client or constituent or whatever
you call the person that pays money to a
dentist ill let you make me a new set of
teeth right away cause to tell the truth

ive been sneezin out these here ones nearly
every time ive sneezed for the last two or
three years

whiteheads wholesale sleuthing

  it was a darkdismal night in august
 torrents deluged the earth light-
nings flashed their fiery darts and thunders
rolled along the vaulted skies just then de-
tective whitehead of the reading railroad
with his great big black slouch-hat pulled
well down over his mustache so as to conceal
his handsomeness said to five other slouch-
hatted sleuths who were with him

to-night men well wholesale em

   well wholesale em  chorused the five
feeling of their guns and retiring still far-
ther into the shadows of the water-tank just
outside eddystone in the keystone state

   by heavens went on detective white-
head they shall not escape us this night
tis a most measly night and one most suit-
ed to our purpose for this night of a surety
the biggest number of them will entrain for
the city to avoid trudging afoot through the
wild commotion of the elements

  right here i must furnish a key to the
situation for some months the employees
of a certain factory at die aforementioned
town of eddystone had been in the habit of
taking possession of a freight-train of the
reading railroad every evening after the
whistle blew for the day-shift to quit

freigh-train joy-riders

  on that train then the men-some two
hundred or three hundred strong-would ride
into philadelphia free they would ride in-
side of empty cars and outside of the filled
cars on the roofs and wherever they could
get a hold on that freight that always so ac-
commodatingly passed the baldwin works
just as the men were quitting for the day

  the reading railroad and the factory own-
ers bodi wanted the men to cease riding dius
and made their wishes known to the men in
the form of big notices posted up at the gates
of the works

  did the men pay heed to the notices 
no they rode into philadelphia every night
just the same literally capturing the train
for how could a few caboose men repel board-
ers who outnumbered them fifty to one

  finally the readings general manager
called detective whitehead into his sanctum
and told him that  those factory hands must
stop riding on that train instanter
light runs on the reading



  thereupon whitehead selected two of the
readings best sleuths as his aides at the
same time the head of the eddystone detec-
tives selected two of his best men as his aides
and that made the total of six in the slouch -
hats who were standing in the shadow of the
water-tank and in the pouring rain near ed-
dystone on the terrible night in question

a harmless hold-up

  the six were waiting for the freight to
come by the engineer had orders to slow up
when he reached the tank and the trap was
ready to be sprung whitehead describing his
intentions very aptly when he said  well
wholesale em 

   pretty soon the six sleuths heard the freight
coming saw her headlight were delighted to
see the engineer slow up as he neared the
water-tank

  now men said whitehead well each
take a separate car ive already told each
of you what to do when once you get inside
of your car this train was run with all
empties to-night purposely so we could catch
em all inside the cars all ready now
dont show any sign of excitement till you
get into your cars and see the whites of the
enemies eyes

  as the train pulled up at
the tank the sleuths sepa-
rated and each of the six
chose a different car and
swung aboard

  whitehead himself climbed
in through the door of the car
nearest him it was crowded
with men all from the fac-
tory-and they were old of-
fenders

  whitehead looked the m
over a minute then suddenly
whipped out his gun and
cried

 hands up everybody 

  up went fifty pairs of
hands

   a hold-up  cried one of
the men

  aint it the limit cried
another  right within a few
miles of philadelphia too

  further remarks were made
-many of the men saying
they didnt object to the hold-
up cause they hadnt a cent
for the hold-up man any-
way

  now said whitehead coolly having
made sure that every hand in the crowd was
held aloft  all you men get out of this car
excepting you four and he flashed his gun
at the four men nearest him

   you four stay right here with me he
went on  all the rest of you get out-and
dont one of you lower your hands till you
get out there in the rain hurry up now
like sheep the men tumbled over one an-
other in their haste to get away from the
hold-up man when all had gone save
the four who had been commanded to re-
main whitehead said

  now then you four are under arrest
arrest they exclaimed astounded
 aint this a hold-up 

  no taint- answered whitehead  im
going to make examples of you four men
come with me

   meantime the other sleuths in their differ-
ent cars had each taken prisoners by pre-
cisely the same method

  and whitehead whispered confidentially
in a dark corner of the reading terminal
not one of those six-shooters was loaded
we six special officers held up moren two
hundred factory hands without weapons of
any kind except six psychologies

hands up everybody

a cab window for night runs

santa fe and chicago and northwestern install device for the better

viewing of tracks by engineers

the santa fe and the chicago and northwest-
ern have adopted a device invented by c m
goodrich of clinton iowa an engineer on the lat-
ter road which is said to eliminate an annoyance to
which engineers are subject on night runs

  even- time the fire-box door is opened a reflection
from the front cab window makes it impossible for
an engineer to see anything but his own image in
the window which compels a frequent change of
focus of his vision and the effect is damaging to
the eyesight on lviglispeed runs an element of
danger is introduced owing to the possibility of
important signals not being seen or obstructions
escaping attention

  the principle of the device referred to consists
essentially in setting the front cab window in such
a position as to greatly increase its angles of inci-
dence and reflection thereby projecting the image

of the cab interior against the side of the cab itself
instead of directly back toward the engineer

  to overcome another difficulty on both night and
day runs due to the accumulation of frost on the
interior of the ordinary cab window in cold weath-
er a small shutter is pivoted near the forward out-
side edge of the window frame in this position
the shutter acts as a scoop directing a current of
cold air through a series of perforations past a de-
flector-plate and in a thin film across the interior
face of the window

  this shutter is so arranged that at the will of the
engineer its forward edge can be brought into con-
tact with the housing along a line forward of the
perforations mentioned thus cutting off the flow
of the air across the plane of the window when at-
mospheric conditions are such as to make it un-
necessary

 making railroad travel safer

by a h smith

vice-president and general manager new york central lines

never before in the history of american railways has such a record for
comparative safety been made as that recorded during the year ending
june   of the  companies reporting to the bureau of ameri-
can railway news and statistics no less than  operating  miles of
track and carrying  passengers went through tlte year without a
single fatality to a passenger in a train accident

    while the scarcity of accidents is due in a great measure to the perfection
of safety devices and improvements in track and rolling stock standardization of
equipment and operation play an almost equal part with the inventions of west-
inghouse janney and coleman the adoption of such standard improvements
as gage couplers and train orders has had its measure of effect

    vice-president smith treats separately of every factor that has played a part
in the safeguarding of travelers and trainmen with an insight and understand-
ing that can only come from long years of experience as a railroad man

the growth and development of up - to - date railroad equipment and
methods of operation and the unceasing struggles to find
practical safety devices

may call it such of safety to progress or as
the subject has been assigned to me  pro-
gressive safety

automatic couplers

  owing to the large number of accidents
occurring in  f d adams of the
boston  albany railroad recommended
to the master car builders association at
its third convention during that year that
a uniform height should be established for
couplers their failure to meet when cars
came together being considered the cause of
numerous accidents

  in  that convention adopted thirty-
three inches as the standard height for stand-
ard-gage cars at the convention of  m
n forney urged that a committee investigate
the cause of accidents and make recom-
mendations this committee in the following
year gave as the principal cause the same as
rr	

          examining into the progress of
safety in transportation by rail
it seems necessary to acquaint
ourselves with its beginnings and
growth to determine the elements
upon which its development re-
lies and the necessity which has invoked the
various steps of improvement in the plant
devoted to transportation and the art of em-
ploying and controlling it in the performance
of a public service

  the lay observer will scarcely appreciate
in the absence of the actual analysis that there
exist so many branches of this subject each
branch of which by itself may be considered
the object of a separate professional science
and a distinct human industry

  we will consider however the beginnings
and the growth of a few of the more impor-
tant and striking items and their relationship
to the state of the art as portraying in a
more graphic manner the adjustment if you


the railroad mans magazine

reported by mr adams eight years before
they pronounced the tests of automatic
couplers to date a failure

  another committee at the same convention
gave the first recognition to automatic coup-
lers by reporting that a great advantage
would be derived from a uniform draw-bar
such as would be - accepted as a standard
and which would be a self-coupler during
several years following various models were
examined but nothing was found to meet
the demands

testing the janney

  in s the executive committee reported
in favor of the janney type of couplers and
all other forms that would automatically cou-
ple with it under all conditions of service
this report was adopted in  by a vote of
 for and  against the executive com-
mittee then undertook to establish contour
lines drawings and templets as standard but
found that the janney patents covered the
contour of vertical plane couplers

  this was remedied in s when the jan-
ney coupler company waived all claims lor
patents on contour lines of coupling surfaces
of car couplers used on railroads that were
members of the master car builders asso-
ciation which enabled the association to
formally adopt in all respects this type of
coupler as standard

  at the convention of  such action was
taken on motion of mr voorhees general
superintendent of the new york central
railroad and since that time this type of
coupler has been the standard and called
the master car builders coupler

  in  congress enacted a law requiring
all railroads engaged in interstate commerce
to provide on all cars and locomotives a con-
tinuous power brake capable of being con-
trolled by the engineman in the locomotive
cab and also automatic couplers which would
operate by impact january   the date
which was set by which these changes must
be made was subsequently extended two
years

  we now have uniformity in height and
contour to insure perfect contact between all
classes of equipment and a positively locked
knuckle

the introduction of air-brakes

  as the density of traffic and the speed to-
gether with the weight of equipment devel-
oped following upon the greater transporta-

tion to be undertaken the question of brakes
became an important factor in the safe opera-
tion of trains more efficient brakes were
needed the essential characteristics being that
they should be continuous throughout the
length of the train simultaneously applied
and released with a single point of control

  in  george westinghouse jr brought
forth what is known as the straight air-brake
consisting of a pump main reservoir three-
way valve brake - cylinder and train - line
application was made by admitting air from
the main reservoir into the train-line the
brakes were released by reducing the train-
line pressure into the atmosphere through the
three-way valve the brakes were useless
if there was a leak a break in the air-line or
a parted train

  with these shortcomings in mind the auto-
matic air-brake was produced in  in
which the method was reversed with the
addition of an auxiliary reservoir under each
passenger-car and a triple valve application
of brakes was secured by reducing the train-
line pressure while admitting air from the
main reservoir raised the pressure and re-
leased the brakes on the application of the
automatic air - brake to freight - cars it was
found the reduction of pressure was not quick
enough to set the rear brakes promptly and
in consequence accidents occurred from
bunching of the cars

signaling devices

  however the following january witnessed
the introduction of the westinghouse quick-
action air-brakes which corrected the pre-
vious trouble and made practicable the ap-
plication of air-brakes to long freight-trains

  continuing from this time there has been
marked improvement and development in all
features of the apparatus without however
modifying the essential elements of which it
is constituted

  the need of indicating the conditions of
the road to trains came with the increasing
traffic and speed as these conditions de-
veloped in england before they did here the
first steps were taken in that country

  in  the liverpool and manchester in-
troduced the first system of fixed signals
consisting of an upright post with a rotating
disk at its top showing red for danger with
absence of indication by day and a white
light bv night for clear

  it was found that a long narrow surface
could be seen farther as projected against
the horizon or landscape than the same area
making railroad travel safer



in a square or circle making use of these
results sir charles gregory in  de-
signed and erected at new cross the first
semaphore signal

  there was no communication between sta-
tions each signalman displaying his signal
at danger after the passage of a train until
a certain time had elapsed when it was
cleared the only information conveyed to
the engineman was that the preceding train
had passed the station at least the required
time before him

electricity helps out

  the failure or inability to act with suffi-
cient promptness at the display of the
danger position and the consequent colli-
sions led to the installation of additional sig-
nals to give advarree information to the en-
gineman of the position of the signal he was
to obey thus we have clearly portrayed the
inception of the present block and caution
signals

  c v walker of the southwestern com-
pany introduced the bell code which was
the first audible method of communication
between signal stations the same year mr
tyer supplemented this with electric visual
signals the object being to give the operator
indication of the signal having been received
and given and at all times to show the exact
position of the signal itself this suggested
the space interval between trains in place of
the time interval making signal indications
definite 

  in  the positive block system was es-
tablished in england based on the space-in-
terval system

the first block system

  making use of telegraph communication
ashbel welch chief engineer of the united
new jersey canal and railroad company
devised and installed during  and 
the first block system of signals in this
country on the double - track line between
philadelphia and new brunswick signal
stations were suitably spaced and at each
station a signal was provided visible as far
as possible each way

  the signal itself was a white board bv day
and a white light by night indicating clear
shown through a glass aperture two feet in
diameter in front of the block signal-box
for the danger indication a red screen fell
to ewer the white board or light

on a trains passing a station the signal-

man released the screen which fell by grav-
ity and did not raise it until advised by tele-
graph that the preceding train had passed
the next station thereby maintaining a space
interval

  thus was evolved the telegraph block sys-
tem still generally used with modifications
of apparatus and signals on lines of light
traffic elaborations of this system were la-
ter installed following more closely the eng-
lish practise perhaps reaching the most com-
plete development upon the new haven and
new york central lines where it is still in
use

  notwithstanding numerous improvements
in apparatus the same practise of fixing a
positive space interval by means of commu-
nication between block stations still holds

  the addition of track circuits for locking
and indicating purposes and interlocking be-
tween stations more fully effected by the in-
troduction of the coleman block instrument
in  has thus evolved the controlled man-
ual block system as now used

first automatic signals

  in s thomas s hall patented an elec-
tric signal and alarm-bell used in connection
with a switch or drawbridge its shortcom-
ing lay in the fact that a break in the circuit
or failure of the battery gave no danger in-
dication to correct this a closed circuit
was necessary although more expensive

  in  mr hall put in operation the
first automatic electric block system on the
new york and harlem railroad between
the grand central station and mott haven
junction it was normal safety the wheels
of a passing train striking a lever completed
a circuit which put the signal to danger af-
ter the train and held it so until the succeed-
ing signal went to danger when a separate
circuit was completed which released the
former signal allowing it to return to clear

track circuits

  the disadvantage in having the wheels of
a train strike a lever to complete the circuit
led f l pope to experiment after a suc-
cessful attempt in transmitting an electric
circuit through an ordinary track with fish-
plate joints he made a signal test at east
cambridge massachusetts

  a section of track was insulated from the
rest with a wire circuit including a bat-
tery and electromagnet for operating the sig-
nal fastened at either end to the opposite


the railroad mms magazine

  rails the metal wheels and axles completed
the circuit throwing the signal to danger
against following trains a detent served
to keep the circuit closed until the next sig-
nal was reached when a separate circuit re-
leased the detent permitting the signal to
clear

  in  this system was put in service
and with some alterations still remains in
some localities

  in the semaphore system numerous fail-
ures have occurred due to the formation of
ice and sleet upon the blades this has led
to the introduction of the so-called upper
quadrant operation that is the motion of
the signal being from horizontal to an up-
wardly inclined position and back

  on account of the wide-spread prevalence
of electric lighting and the building up of
the territory adjacent to railroads changes in
the color indication of night signals have
been adopted generally in such localities
using green instead of white for the safety
indication

interlocking switches

  developing with the manual operation of
signals and as a safeguard against mistakes
of the signalmen interlocking grew up as a
means for preventing conflicting signals be-
ing given at the same time as with signals
so with interlocking england led at first
after a trip to that country in  mr
ashbel welch recommended the advantage
derived from the english method of operating
switches and signals in large yards and ter-
minals where the entire control fell to one
man so located as to be in touch with the
whole situation and equipped with a machine
that would not permit of setting up conflict-
ing routes the plea resulted in the order
of a twentv-lever saxby  farmer interlock-
ing machine which was installed in 
on the new jersey division of his line

  railroads were prompt to see its advantage
and in a short time machines performing its
functions were made and installed in this
country not only for the protection of rail-
road intersections but for the control of
large terminal layouts

  in  the first power-operated interlock-
ing system was perfected which was the
pneumatic type in  an all-electric in-
terlocking system advantageous where dis-
tant functions were to be embraced within the
operation of the plant and applicable to
localities where electric traction was in use
was devised

  the more recent development of power-
operated interlocking systems with complete
electric indication of the conditions on all
tracks has made it possible for larger sys-
tems to be consolidated under the control of
a central plant and thus under the direction
of a central authority these machines being
of- a completely interlocked character insure
greater safety by the central control as well
as greater facility of operation

the growth of train-despatching

  in this country the first radical departure
from the time interval and flagging method
of operation came in  the new york
and erie railroad had established a single
line of telegraph between piermont on the
hudson river and dunkirk on lake erie
for company business

  the superintendent of telegraph mr lu-
ther c tillottson and the division superin-
tendent were together in the elmira depot on
one occasion when they learned that the
west-bound express from new york was four
hours late at corning an east-bound stock-
train and a west-bound freight at elmira
waited for the express

  with this information mr tillottson sug-
gested that the freight-train at elmira could
be sent to corning and the stock-train at that
point ordered to elmira with perfect safety
before the arrival of the express

  the move was successful and encouraged
similar operation which shortly led to the
adoption with some modifications of this
train - despatching method on the susque-
hanna division of the erie its adoption over
the entire line followed in spite of the great
opposition which mr charles minot the
general superintendent met when planning
for its introduction

  some of the conductors and enginemen
went so far as to resign their positions rather
than run on telegraphic orders against the
time of another train

standardizing of orders

  this system spread rapidly to other lines
and in company with other features of rail-
road operation has been progressively devel-
oped and improved one of the important
elements of safety in the despatching practise
has been the tendency to the same words in
the same sequence to comey the same in-
structions insuring a uniform understanding
of the instructions instead of permitting a

misunderstanding in construing tiie order
transmitted

  the rules for train-despatching now pre-
scribe the use of standard forms of expression
for orders governing the movement of trains

  within the past few years experiments
have been made with a system of train-des-
patching by telephone now in successful op-
eration upon some important lines and
growing in extent advantage lies in the
ability to use trained railroad employees
who cannot work under the telegraph system
not being telegraph operators

car construction

  the telephone despatching system not
only insures a rapid distribution of informa-
tion but by its greater capacity enables a
more complete knowledge of the state of the
line to be had in the controlling office as
well as in all the offices tributary to the des-
patching system

  one of the early problems in transporta-
tion was to secure the carrying capacity of
cars as well as safety we have pointed out
how it was necessary to add a guiding truck
to the english locomotive designed to adapt
the same locomotive safely to american con-
ditions

  both the excessive wheel loads on four-
wheel freight-cars and the greater liability
to accident or derailment led to the use of
four-wheeled trucks under cars

increase in size

  the increase in lengths of passenger-cars
with corresponding increases in weight led
about  to the quite general employment
of a six-wheel truck instead of a four-wheel
truck and even eight-wheel trucks were used
for a time but rejected on account of the
excessive length of wheel-base and other
complications

  in the latter eighties experiments were
made in the development of steel framing for
car construction and built-up steel under-
frames were introduced shortly after at
first on cars for mineral traffic where ex-
cessive weights and capacities were required
the success of this type of construction has
led to its adaptation at the present time to
all classes of equipment and not only steel
underframes by complete steel construction
in certain classes of scrvice where the con-
ditions require

  the question of steel cars and composite
steel and wooden cars is having very care-

ful investigation and experiment at the
present time

the safe heating of cars

  the original method of heating passenger-
cars by direct radiation from coal or wood
stoves was a source of discomfort to the
passengers as well as a menace in case of
disaster this brought about in the late
eighties die introduction of the baker hot
water heater which w-as a great improve-
ment for the comfort of passengers but still
left a fire in the car

  in many instances of collisions and de-
railments during this period especially in
winter the cars were set on fire and the
wreckage consumed from the fire scattered
from the stoves or heaters

  the growth in the capacity of locomotive
boilers and the perfection of the couplings
between cars has led to the present practise
of car heating which entirely eliminates the
presence of any fire or source of danger from
that source

car lighting

  car lighting has passed through the same
stages as house lighting possibly more grad-
ually on account of the greater difficulties
the old low - roofed passenger - cars were
illuminated by candles about two inches in
diameter placed in racks along the sides of
the car with b the advent of mineral oil
just before the civil war the candles gave
place to oil- amps

  for more than fifteen years this method
prevailed and while the presence of oil-
lamps in wrecks contributed fuel to the
flames the proof that they were in any way
the principal cause was lacking still to
eliminate this contributory feature attempts
were made to use ordinary coal gas com-
pressed in tanks on each car this how-
ever proved unsatisfactory

  in  a system of compressed gas made
from crude petroleum had been invented by
julius pintsch of berlin and by  had
been put into a number of cars on european
railroads the light was too dim to satisfy
american conditions it was only a ques-
tion of time however for its proper and ade-
quate development to our needs when its use
became general on the perfection of the lamp
and burner

  for the last fifteen years electric lighting
of various types has been in use on cars in an
experimental way while possessing advan-

tages perhaps in safety owing to low volt-
ages and small quantity of current its gen-
eral use has not yet been entirely practicable
owing to the complications involved either
in generating and satisfactorily controlling
the current upon the cars or in supplying it
at terminals through storage batteries

  equally important is the advancement of
the rail and its fastenings the type of metal
rails of which the bottom served as the run-
ning surface for flat wheels guided by a
flange on the rail gave place to edge rails on
which flanged wheels used the upper surface
of the rail before the day of the steam loco-
motive

  of the edge type the first were cast iron
fish bellied in sections about three feet in
length they were supported by stone blocks
or in cast-iron chairs which were in turn
made secure to the stone later the same
type was made of wrought iron by john bir-
kinshaw in england who rolled it up to fif-
teen or eighteen feet in length

the evolution of the rail

  from s to  the flat strap rail
spiked to longitudinal timbers in turn sup-
ported by cross-ties was largely used in this
country as it was the only shape that could
be rolled here

  the present  t  section was invented in
 by colonel stevens chief engineer of
the camden and amboy railway and until
 when it was first rolled in this country
had to be imported from england the poor
quality of the iron at this time required such
a broad support in the design of the rail for
the head that no satisfactory plate-fastening
could be secured iron shoes into which
the rail ends fitted were the means of con-
nection

  the greatest improvement dates from s
when the first steel rails were rolled in eng-
land ten years later they were experiment-
ally rolled here in  through the intro-
duction of the bessemer process which made
possible their manufacture at a greatly re-
duced cost began a revolution in track con-
struction

  while the decade from  to  wit-
nessed the greatest rate of railroad building
in this country it also witnessed the sub-
stantial substitution of steel rails on our
lines the earlier rails weighed from fifty
to seventy pounds per yard the increasing
weight of equipment brought out a heavier
section and fifteen years ago there was a
large percentage of mileage on which

weights of ninety pounds and over-and
even one hundred pounds-per yard had
been introduced under special conditions
rails weighing as high as one hundred and
fort pounds per yard are used

elimination of grade-crossings

  in the early days both the railroads and
public ways used the natural surface of the
ground as a matter of economy the public
question then was how they were to get the
railroads and not how they were to restrict
them in the manner of their construction
the districts traversed were sparsely set-
tled and trains were few and slow in their
movement the highways were little used
all of which made for freeclam from acci-
dent where the two crossed

  with the increase in population and the
development of the country came the need
of increased transportation facilities more
frequent faster and heavier trains were
moving upon the railroads and a greater
number of people came to use the highways
the inevitable number result followed and
at length the great number of accidents oc-
curring at the grade-crossings attracted pub-
lic attention

  the legislature of massachusetts took the
first action in  when it provided for
the appointment of a railroad commission to
investigate and report upon safer and better
methods of construction and operation they
very promptly took up the grade-crossing
question

grade-crossing legislation

  the new york state board of railroad
commmissioners was created in  and its
membership appointed by the governor
among the functions which they immediate-
ly assumed was the question of public
safety in connection with crossings at grade
of railroads and highways the considera-
tion which this received and the complaints
of unsafe conditions as well as the compli-
cations and adjudications involved led to
the passing of the grade-crossing law
which went into effect july  

  not only by the new york state law but
by the massachusetts law the method of
elimination as well as the apportionment of
expense is specific the initiative is open
to both the railroad and to the community
and the rapid progress of eliminations in
these two states may be taken as an indorse-
ment of the wisdom of such legislation pa-
making railroad travel safer



ving the way as it does for more progress on
the question of eliminations than it is be-
lieved would ordinarily take place where no
specific rule existed for the undertaking

  while the exact conditions throughout the
country are not definitely known it is be-
lieved that progress is being made quite
generally in this direction

  notwithstanding the great improvements
in road-bed track bridges signals equip-
ment and other respects all securing in-
creased service and safety in railroad opera-
tion tjie human element is a vital factor
which has to be taken into consideration
with a view of raising the standard of
individual service a system of physical and
educational examinations has been adopted

the selection of employees

  employees must pass examinations as to
vision color sense and hearing and their
knowledge of the fundamental rules and
regulations as well as the fundamental
knowledge of road appliances and equip-
ment these examinations are repeated
from time to time as the class of service and
furdier advancement of the employee may
require many of the large railroads have
established schools with capable instructors
where employees may receive instruction up-
on the performance of their duties as well
asaffording them an opportunity to fit
themselves for promotion

  from a few miles of crude tramways the
world has in a century built  miles
of steam operated and  miles of
electrically operated roads instead of sprag-
ging the wheels we rely on the automatic
high-speed brake the coupling of cars has
become an imitation of the action of human
hands instead of risking their destruction

  each train finds the condition of road
ahead and protects itself by the agency of
electric circuits and semaphores the se-
quence of whose operation discloses on be-
half of safety any obstruction that may block
the route

  four-wheel barrows are replaced by steel
cars larger than the miners cabin and car-
rying more than his months output

  instead of traveling on a tramway stage-
coach the passenger finds available for his
comfort a modern hotel on wheels with
every luxury known to-day electrically
lighted steail-heated weather-proof the
old strap-iron rails which became detached
and penetrated the car floor frequently im-
pinging passengers to the roof have been

replaced by bars of steel weighing one hun-
dred pounds to the yard whose manufacture
installation and maintenance is prescribed
with every degree of refinement known to the
chemist and engineer

decrease of fatalities

  progress of a pronounced character has
occurred that this progress has been ac-
companied by increased safety is demon-
strated by common knowledge and confirmed
by the records both of the railroads and the
public authorities as an illustration take
the statistics of - the interstate commerce
commission the increased safety of rail-
road operation is indicated in part by the
following figures based on the number of
passengers carried monthly by the railroads
of the united states which at present is
estimated between eight and nine hundred
millions

  for the decade following the beginning of
the records namely - the fatali-
ties were  in 

  for the next decade bringing it down to
the present time the fatalities were  in


  the gain in ratio being for the nation at
large fully twenty per cent

  looking at the conditions in the state of
new york where the density of travel is con-
siderably in excess of that of the country as a
whole we find a report of the state engineer
in the year  showing the ratio of fatali-
ties of  in 

  the average for six years  to 
inclusive shows  in 

  an increase in relative safety of eight hun-
dred per cent

danger from trespassers

  one of the thoughts that occurs to me was
suggested by a recent exhibit from the records
of the loss of life damage to railroad prop-
erty as well as injury to persons and prop-
erty conveyed due to the presence of unau-
thorized persons upon railroad property
whether wilfully or carelessly trespassing

  as an illustration of its seriousness dur-
ing last year over five thousand trespassers
lost their lives on railroads besides a large
number injured numerous mishaps have
been traced to acts of trespassers which may
be the secret of many unexplained casualties
the railroads are a highway for the migra-
tions of tramps and unemployed persons
who commit petty depredations jeopardize

the safety of trains and die lives of employees
and passengers

  it seems of no avail that thousands of the
worst class are arrested by railroad police
forces and convictions secured as the sen-
tences in the majority of cases serve rather to
aggravate than mitigate the evil one line
arrested over nine thousand traspassers dur-
ing the past year and secured convictions in
seventy-five per cent of the cases but in half
of diem sentence was suspended which usual-
ly meant that the-offender used the railroad
to escape from the scene

  i do not wish to be understood to asperse
the administration of justice nor to insist
that offenses of a serious character are always

committed by railroad trespassers but the
hazard involved is one that should not be
permitted to exist the railroad property des-
troyed or damaged bearing no relation to the
risk of persons and property transported
and to the enormous loss of life involved

  wherein lies the increased safety of the
future may perhaps be the query in many
minds it must be the product not only of
an enlightened public opinion and the con-
servative wisdom of public representatives
but progressive and careful management
coupled with a sense of discipline and re-
sponsibility and industry of railroad em-
ployees who must jointly share the obliga-
tions of the problem	--

 concrete ties on the santa fe

they have stood three years test without deterioration and cost the

company only one dollar apiece

in anjeffort to make more progress in the mighty
tie problem of the modern american railroad
to-day the santa fe has taken up the reenforced
concrete-tie experiment and lias witnessed the first
signs of success

  in june  the santa fe placed twenty reen-
forced concrete ties in the main track between los
angeles california and redondo junction in
march  the inspector of track and roadway
reported that the ties showed  no indication of de-
terioration or failure in any way and in april
 they were reported to be  in first-class con-
dition in every respect the track on this line is
ballasted with gravel and the traffic is heavy

  the mcdonald tie is reenforced with horizontal
steel rods bent up under the rail seats and tied to-
gether at intervals with vertical rods which serve
also as web reenforcement the rail is secured to
the tie by spiking into sections wrought iron pipe
set in the concrete

  the inside diameter of the pipe used for this
purpose is a little less than the greatest dimension
of the spike so that the spike may be cut through
the metal enough to insure a firm connection

  the length of the section of pipe is made the
same as the depth of the tie and both ends are
passed through tie-plates and expanded so as to
hold the plates solidly in the surface of the con-
crete this construction allows the tie to be used
with either face up it is necessary to use a spike

with a head so formed that its under face will con-
form to the top of the rail base when the spike is
partially rotated for at each redriving the spike
should be turned so that its edges will cut an un-
used portion of the pipe and furnish a new bond

  when the surface of the concrete crumbles under
the tie-plate or the end of the tube becomes too
badly worn to hold the spike the tie may be turned
over in the trade thus providing a new surface and
an unused portion of pipe to spike into

  the cost of the tie when made in small numbers
is given by the inventor at about one dollar and
thirty cents and it is stated on the same authority
that a railroad by using company forces in the ma-
king of the ties could reduce this price by at least
twenty-five cents

  in addition to the installation on the santa fe a
slightly modified form of this tie has been installed
on all the lines of the los angeles railway com-
pany but no reports of its performance have been
made

  the shortage of suitable timber for railroad ties
and the constantly increased expense of the same
has led many railroad companies to make experi-
ments costing thousands of dollars for the purpose
of improving the tie situation

  at present the santa fe is shipping millions of
ties from japan to place under the rails in this
western country costing the company millions of
dollars

you can run lots of trains on a single track if they all run one way-

       foibles of the chief despatcher
by roland ashford phillips

          even the qualms of conscience could not keep
          him away from the great city he loved

he evening was hot sullen and
depressive the sea running
black as ink seemed to swell
up a stones throw from the
low - hanging stars i sat in
the steamer-chair beneath the
striped awning and the monotonous throb of
the engines came to my ears like the hum of
countless insects

  at intervals a vivid shower of sparks
leaping from the twin stacks rained down
upon the white deck and motionless awning
it was my second day out of honolulu east-
ward bound and i judged we were making
good time toward our port for a hold of pine-
apples is a risky cargo under a tropical sun

  shortly after supper when i had made
myself comfortable on deck the stranger
whom i had twice met in the general cabin
came slowly down the deck his white duck
making him a conspicuous figure in the half
gloom

   he spoke to me amiably and lowered him-
self to a chair beside me under the awning
he was hatless his head was nearly bald
and he was very thin and gaunt-emaciated i
might say as if he had recently left a sick-

bed i immediately conjured up fever it
being the most plausible excuse in the trop-
ics his face lean and hollow-cheeked al-
though not ill cast was covered with a light
beard and by the manner in which he toyed
with it i imagined it to be of recent growth
he must have been all of six feet tall

   im lonesome to-night he confessed
will i disturb you here

  i had no objections in truth i was glad
he came so we sat and talked and smoked
for quite an interval until abruptly and for
no stated reason we spoke of the city toward
which we journeyed	

  my home he said quickly and there
was a ring of pride in his declaration my
home i love it ive watched it grow for
thirty years you easterners cant realize
how we love our city its a mother-love
he added softly

  ive often heard of state loyalty i ob-
served lamely

  he pulled on his cigarette the glow bring-
ing his bearded face into momentary relief

  that city is almost the only mother i
have known he went on  i was bom there
ive watched it broaden out mile by mile i

gloried in every building that was erected
even stone that was put in place ah  he
breathed reverently im glad im going
back

   then youve been away long

   long i havent seen the city for three
years think of that three awful years in
honolulu ive been the same as dead

   the captain spoke for the first time he
had come up from his cabin and had taken
the last chair near the railing

    i can sympathize with you he said  i
once had to stay there a whole year it was
like taking a baby away from its mother
why when i came back i walked up main
street crying for happiness  id work in
the streets like a dog before id stay away that
long again

    on the contrary i observed after a mo-
ments hesitation  i never enjoyed myself
so well as in the islands if it wasnt for
business id never return in the past few
years i have been something of a traveler
but for some reason or other i overlooked that
bit of pacific paradise until this season may-
be it was a good thing i did for i wouldnt
have cared to go anywhere else

    youve never lived in our city the stran-
ger put in quietly as if nothing more need
be said

  i shrugged my shoulders and bowed be-
neath his argument

   we smoked in silence for a space after the
captain had accepted one of my cigarettes
and the throbbing of the engines sounding
like the beating of some great heart seemed
to lull one into forgetfulness

   ive often got to thinking about the poor
devils down there on the islands-the fellows
who love the city like we do-who cant go
back the captain broke in  it must be
pretty much like hades if there is one on
earth ive often got to thinking about it
the canvas chair on the other side of me
in which the stranger sat creaked as if he had
suddenly twisted about in it i looked over
at the captain for his remark puzzled me
why cant they go back i asked
theyre afraid it was the stranger
who spoke and answered me he was lean-
ing forward in his chair but the shadow fell
in such a way that i could not easily see his
face

   then the light broke in upon me  i had
forgotten of course i understand what you
mean now i suppose there are any number
of crooks blackmailers ex-bank presidents
and such floating about the islands eh
wonder i hadnt thought of it before

  ive talked with a good many of them
the captain put in  and if their sufferings
were only known only understood im sure
the law would be satisfied im speaking of
their mental sufferings of course theres no
more horrible punishment than that of the
mind to my way of thinking conscience
kills where laws only wound many a poor
man has got free of the law only to suffer
along for a few years and finally give up
for my part id stay at home and take the
punishment

  the captains simple logic appealed to me
vividly i had never looked upon the sub-
ject in that light before the thought of a
man fleeing the law only to battle with him-
self set my jaded interest at fever-heat

  and these men i spoke up eagerly
 are they never found out  do they go un-
der another name   i wanted to bring out
all i could now that my curiosity was
aroused

  there was old man hiltz the captain
began ignoring my direct questions but not
the theme  he skipped out between meals
with a half million on him only last month
i met an american outside of honolulu-
an overseer on one of the big sugar planta-
tions-who was a dead ringer for him he
had grown a beard and his hair was gray
he got me aside and made me talk about home
to him all day long it was hiltz all right
and hes suffering more right now than he
would behind the bars hell either kill him-
self or get reckless and come back

  a sudden recollection swept over me after
he had finished i straightened in my chair

  the day before i sailed i put in i
saw a man watching me in a little cafe near
the park when i looked at him i knew i
had seen him somewhere before all the time
i was eating i was thinking like mad then
it came to me i got up and walked over to
his table  youre singleton arent you  i
asked holding out my hand he stared at
me emptily although his cheeks went very
white  youre mistaken in the party he
came back quickly  my names living-
stone   

  and you think it was singleton it
was the stranger who asked

   i was somewhat doubtful then of course
after his denial but im positive of it now
he was tanned and smooth-faced but he
couldnt hide his eyes he was once the
mayor of our city got into some graft deal
or other and skipped

  the captain laughed shortly  you run
across them all over the woods are full of
the lure



them that makes me think of another fel-
low-john warwick wonder i never came
across him maybe i did though and didnt
recognize him hes on the islands

   and what was his offense  the stran-
ger seemed interested insurance deals
no the captain shook his head slow-
ly and appeared to be groping in the past
for the memory no he was a pilot
used to bring in the ships from the outer ha-r-
bor one sunday he brought in an excursion-

you or me had a little kid on that boat-or a
wife-im thinking wed forget and-

i interrupted  but you said it was foggy
it might not have been neglect we ought to
give him consideration dont you think
the captains big hand slapped to his knee
 warwick was drunk-dead drunk  he
exclaimed

  i drew my feet down from the coil of rope
a puff of wind came from somewhere bul-
ging the awning above us i stared medita-

 warwick was drunk-dead drunk

boat and ran it on some rocks it was a lit-
tle bit foggy but that shouldnt have made
much difference to an old hand like warwick
anyhow the boat went down and half a
hundred were drowned warwick dropped
out of sight and everybody thought he was
drowned too then one day a mate of mine
said he had talked with him in honolulu
every time im in the town i keep my eye
peeled for him

   and whats the feeling against him at
home the stranger questioned

  well as a general thing we dont jump
at conclusions but it was a pretty hard blow
for some of the people it was about as big
a crime as a man can commit im thinking
and i suppose if he was to step ashore to-
day thered be something like a lynching
the laws good enough in its way but if

tively across the white space where a lamp
glowed amidship far up toward the cabin
a door opened and shut and a bar of light
shot obliquely over the deck in another mo-
ment the wireless operator came down and
addressed the captain

   just picked up a message from the
gladola two days out from home shell be
in our radius for the next hour or so you
said you wanted to speak to her

   quite right the captain lifted himself
erect  youll excuse me gentlemen 

  they walked away the coatless white-
shirted operator in the lead i watched them
subconsciously until the door opened and
slammed then the stranger moved in his
chair and spoke

   what do you think of this warwick  he
asked


the railroad mans magazine

   i believe if he loved the city as you fel-
lows seem to hed risk coming back

  i received no answer then curiously i
resumed

  and what do you suppose would be his
greatest concern once he left the island
capture 

  i dont think so the stranger spoke
so queerly that i turned about in my chair
 he would be fearful that he would not see
the city after all

  not see it  i echoed

   yes the man got to his feet and
tossed away the remaining part of -his ciga-
rette i waited expectantly for him to go
on but he did not he stood for the inter-
val gazing far out over the black water and
then without another word turned and
walked up the deck

  the following day passed monotonously
and it was at supper that i first caught sight
of the stranger he appeared very nervous
and did not seem at all anxious to talk

   youll see home in the morning i said
hopefully as we were passing out then
he looked at me and for the first time i no-
ticed how vague and dead his eyes were

   i-hope so he struggled

  we foimd our chairs again but somehow
i felt no inclination to smoke the air was
strangely oppressive and seemed to fairly
choke one the evening sky too took on an
unusual pallor i thought and the long un-
even waves that rocked away toward the hori-
zon were very high very oily and black

   what time-are we due to-morrow   the
strangers voice broke into the hush

   early some time about nine oclock i
should judge and then after a pause  i
suppose the city will be changed-since you
last saw it

  i was surprised to find his fingers on my
arm

   i hope not he faltered  i-hope not
i want to see it - just like when i went
away i dont want to see a single thing
changed his fingers tightened heav-
ens he breathed heavily to see the
old city again to walk the street in the
crowds to hear all the old familiar voices
and to see the old familiar buildings-the
buildings i have watched rise up from the
vacant wastes to feel the breeze from off
the bay to watch the ferries-

  his voice trailed into a whisper and i
could hear him breathe like a man who has
run a long distance

  dumbly i realized how he must have felt
and how inadequate his words were to ex-

press it and later when i sought my state-
room i pondered deeply over the mans in-
fatuation for his mother city wondering what
peculiar mysterious power it possessed to so
enslave its children

  i was a long time in getting to sleep for
my room was like an oven above me on the
shelf droned an electric fan but the air it
stirred was stale and lifeless however aft-
er  time i must have dozed off for abruptly
my eyes snapped open and i found the day-
light streaming in through the window

  i dressed and went out on deck with
the possible exception of the watch no one
was about i paced up and down for a time
and then rooting my very feet to the deck i
saw the ships operator leap grotesquely out
from the cabin and lurch toward me

  his face was pasty and his eyes staring
from tlicir sockets were as hard and fixed as
glass he was clad only in his pajamas

  for love of heaven he choked as he
neared me  i just picked up the first coast
wireless -the city- he fumbled desper-
ately at his throat and while he stood there
gasping i saw the figure of the stranger
climbing the short stairs toward us

   go on go on  i urged

   the city-was destroyed-byearthquake
-this morning the operator stammered
 shes in flames-burning-burning-abso-
lutely  hope left everythings gone 

  with horror-stricken eyes i saw the stran-
ger grope blindly for the hand-rail choke
out something like a scream and then crumple
limply to the deck

  stunned yet retaining possession of my
senses i managed to call one of the watch
and togedier we bore the unconscious man
back to his stateroom with a queer lump in
my throat i saw that his berth had not been
slept in

  after i had hurriedly bathed his head in
some cold water and unloosened his clothes
he finally came back to the world again he
mumbled incoherently to himself and his
glassy eyes stared emptily at the ceiling

   all-gone  he whispered  all gone i
i knew-knew i was-never to see her again
my poor-poor-home 

  brace up i encouraged after his voice
died away  dont take on like this be a
man 

  he sat up rigidly as if my words had been
a needle in his flesh and instinctively i re-
coiled

   i will be a man he returned huskily-
 i will be a man youll help me wont
you ive been a miserable coward all diese
the lure



years ive sinned-sinned
ive sinned against my own
city-my home his eyes
suddenly became radiant
but im going to repay
im going to repay 

  youre ill-out of your
head i faltered lie still
and rest

   my heaven  he cried
throwing wide his arms
are you so blind dont
you understand im war-
wick-warwick 

  where we entered the har-
bor i did not know the pi-
lots confession abrupt as it
had come together with the
catastrophe into which we
were heading robbed me of
all immediate reason i
leaned against the rail of the
ship and watched the vast
cloud of smoke growing larger
and more terrifying spread-
ing from horizon to horizon
like a black pall the cap-
tain rushed back and forth
shouting incoherent orders
which the white-faced silent
crew obeyed mechanically

  while we were creeping in
toward the dim shore - for
the captain had announced
his intention of landing at the first conve-
nient dock inside the harbor - and i had
huddled against the side of the pilot-house
in order to keep free from the suffocating
smoke i felt a hand on my arm and peer-
ing around found warwick beside me

   theyre dying-dying he mumbled over
and over like an automaton and pointing
with his outstretched arm theyre dying
-burning-all my people-all my city

  when the smoke lifted a trifle and the
ship pushed her nose into a deserted dock
warwick gave a cry and leaped from my side
i called to him frantically but he kept on
unheeding what sudden impulse guided
me i could not tell but without a second
thought i followed him he did not wait
for the plank to be lowered but climbing the
rail like a cat leaped upon the roof of the
dock-shed and dropped nimbly to the ground
like a man possessed i followed him

  now that we were upon solid ground i
caught up with him

  where are you going i shouted for

destitute of all thought other than to save

the noise about us was deafening  what
are you going to do  

   let me go he screamed  theyre dy-
ing-burning dont you hear them calling
-calling for me to help them  do you want
me to be a coward-again  

  so we raced on side by side an exulting
madness burned in my veins i remembered
nothing thought of nothing cared for noth-
ing save that countless humans were in dan-
ger about us and that we were going to help
them explosions followed one upon another
rocking the very ground beneath us

  we left the clocks behind and hurried up
the steep hill toward the burning smoke-ob-
scured area above many people passed us
now all running in the opposite direction
their arms filled yet all strangely silent and
like so many frightened spirits

  a woman carrying a baby tripped and fell
heavily and warwick his face working
queerly bent over and lifted her to her feet
again after she had gone he came close to
me and spoke


the railroad mans magazine

  the baby-was dead he panted and i
saw that the tears were running down his
cheeks  i saw its poor little face it was
dead and she didnt know it

  walls were falling about us and the
smoke became so dense that we could scarcely
distinguish the road weird flames licked
here and there their breath stabbing our
lungs i blindly followed warwick from
one house into another my hat was lost i
threw aside my coat my arms grew numb
with pain and my fingers were bleeding and
yet mad men that we were we realized noth-
ing

  in the midst of this chaos a little girl
wildly clutching a doll her-clothes all but
torn from her poor thin body ran out into
the road i lifted her into my arms

  mama-my mama she began to sob
hysterically  my mama wont wake up 

  i ran across the yard and climbed through
a broken window of the house

   my mama-was in bed the child went
on her thin voice barely audible  she wont
wake up 

  i groped my way through the rooms until
i foundthe chamber half-way toward the
bed a violent nausea gripped me the whole
side of the wall had fallen in and only the
end of the bed showed beneath the debris

   i staggered out holding tight to the child
unmindful of her screams within a short
distance i came upon warwick he seemed
to be here there everywhere shouting and
talking wildly with himself

  fascinated i watched him fie dashed
into this gaping doorway and that appearing
after a certain length of time with a limp
burden in his arms he appeared to be des-
titute of all thought other than to save save
save

  standing there amid the flame and smoke

safe-guarding

whitewashing coal would seem to be

rather a silly proposition but it is not
done for looks nor to change the quality of the
material it is rather a detective scheme which is
simple and is said to be effective the purpose is
to locate loss of coal from open cars in transit

   the top of the load is sprayectwith lime and wa-
ter-an easy and cheap process it is thus whit-
ened as the water evaporates and the appearance
is that of a load of white coal any disturbance
of this surface by removing of even a small quan-
tity is readily noticeable by observing this at
division and junction points the place of the dis-
appearance can be approximately located

  and crumbling walls i could but dimly won-
  der whether this one hour did not more than
  balance his sinning surely the scales of
  mercy are just

    then the child on my shoulder began to
  whimper interrupting my thoughts and
  clapping a brutal hand across her mouth i
  hurried on

    a stone building broke out of the pall
  ahead of us and i saw warwick standing ir-
  resolutely before it parts of the wall were
  crumbling and the flames were leaping out
  from the windows

    dont go in there i shouted to him
   itll fall-fall-in a minute stand away 

    but he only laughed-gaunt burned and
  horrible as he was-and stumbled unheeding-
  ly toward the sagging door his beard had
  gone-his clothes were in threads and smo-
  king his eyes were bloodshot hard as glass
  and bereft of all understanding

    theres-some one-in there his voice
  rang back to me i heard them calling
  and before i could move or speak he had
  gone

    i saw the flames leap higher and higher
  roaring like a wind among the trees and then
  the walls swayed in like a curtain in the
  breeze

    the sudden collapse stunned me i reeled
  over as though some mighty hand had crushed
  upon my chest

    the childs sobbing cleared my brain for
  the moment the poor little blistered face
  wet with tears buried itself against my shoul-
  der

    i struggled to my feet lifted her once
  more into my aching arms held her tight
  against my heart and turning followed the
  army of white-faced silent stragglers that
  moved out toward the open green hills above
  us up there the sun was shining

open goal-cars

     this plan has been tried on some western roads
  and has we understand been abandoned solely on
  account of the opposition of dealers who claim
  that their customers do not want coal so treated
  as the quality of the coal is unaffected there can
  be no reasonable objection to it

     the real reason is believed to be that dealers pre-
  fer not to get the protected coal but prefer the
  opportunity of making claims for alleged losses in
  transit if this is the fact there is a loop-hole here
  which railway commissions state or national
  might well look into it is to the best interest of
  shippers and carriers that there should be no losses
  in transit and no bogus claims for alleged losses

a bunch of new ones by the knights of the grip who keep the smoking-
compartment in a good humor and help to shorten the long
hours spent in gliding over the rails

she had lost her money and a pearl pin
and you would have thought she was going
to lose her life too from the row she kicked
up it certainly looked as if there would
be a hot time for the car-porter at the end of
the run when the railroad officials took him
in hand

   it was close to an hour before things
quieted down then i went to sleep again
but somewhere near daylight i woke up with
a jump a woman was screaming  thief 

   in a second my head was out through the
curtains just in time to see a fat man jump
out of an upper berth and land with a whoop
on the shoulders of another man in the aisle
the man he landed on crumpled up in a
heap under him and in no time half a dozen
other passengers were helping the fat man
pin him down

   it looked like a football scrimmage with
fellows in pajamas and nightshirts all tan-
gled up and it sounded like a lunatic asylum
broke loose every woman in the car was
screaming like a maniac some of em crying
 thieves  and others  murder  while the
man at the bottom of the writhing pile was
yelling for the police

   the prim old lady who had caused the
first row was out in the aisle protesting that

yer since that experience on
the big four ive always felt
nervous about being the only
one up in a carful of sleep-
ing passengers said frank
wade who travels for a bos-
ton shoe factory  and i guess sam rosen-
thal feels the same way he ought to hes
got more cause than i have if i was sam i
wouldnt feel safe in a sleeper-berth till id
roped myself down

   sam and i were in the same line at the
time both running out from boston selling
to the wholesale trade we ran across each
other in st louis both on our way to catch
die night train for cleveland he managed
to get a lower berth while i drew an upper
one several numbers away

  we turned in early for we had both had
a hard day and i slept like a log until the
small hours of the morning when a terrible
rumpus in the car woke me up

   a prim old lady across the way from me
was screaming that shed been robbed of all
her money and a gold watch and the pull-
man conductor and the train conductor were
trying to pacify her about the same time
another woman in the other end of the car
discovered that she had also been robbed


the railroad mans magazine

the thief had come back and had tried to get
into her berth and when the fat man had
untangled himself from the scrimmage he
backed her up

    his berth was directly over the old ladys
and when she screamed he jumped out in
time to land on the man as he was fumbling
at her curtains

  while she was telling her story some-
body yanked the captive up from the floor
by the collar and who do you suppose it
was who had been down at the bottom of
that free-for-all

   for a minute i thought i must be having
a nightmare it was rosenthal a five-
thousand-dollar-a-year man who had been
on the road for twenty years caught robbing
berths

   he had a black eye his clothes were
ripped up the back and blood was trickling
down his forehead but it was sam all right
the most curious thing about it was that he
was yelling  police  it isntnatural for a
man caught in the act to yell for the police

    but there didnt happen to be any police-
men aboard it would be time enough to call
them when we got into cleveland

   in the meantime sam didnt seem to
realize what a serious scrape hed got him-
self into instead he was swearing ven-
geance and talking about suing the road and
having the fat man arrested for assault

    sam i said  you had better keep
quiet and when we get to cleveland ill look
up a good lawyer for you

  but that only made him madder

    keep quiet  he yelled  would you
keep quiet if youd had a whole car-load of
passengers jump on you its lucky im
alive 

    but look here sam said i  youre in
a tight fix youve got to face a charge of
robbing that old ladv

  what he cried why i wasnt
doing a thing id only just crawled out of
my berth when that three-hundred-pound
brute up-stairs landed on me and then the
whole carful came and piled on a lunatic
asylums being moved i guess and this is it
thats the only explanation i can think of

   of course i had decided already that
he was the crazy one that he had had a sud-
den attack of insanity that had shown itself
in kleptomania

  well we flew along without a stop from
the time of the riot till we rolled into cleve-
land in the cleveland yards a couple of
detectives got aboard one of them nabbed
sam and the porter the other happened to

take a peep into the wash-room on his way
through and he stepped in and laid hold of
a little man who was sitting all alone in
there smoking

  he had recognized him as an old-time
crook who hadnt been out of prison three
months the stolen jewelry was found on
his clothes

   even then the old lady wasnt satisfied
when they let sam go free she wanted to
know why he had been trying to get into her
berth that was what puzzled me too

   it wasnt until two months later that some-
thing happened in the great northern hotel
chicago that solved the mystery rosenthal
appeared in the lobby at midnight just as a
lot of people from the theaters were coming
in clad only in his pajamas

  he was walking in his sleep and as he
finally admitted that is just what he must
have been doing in the sleeper when the old
lady caught him

the bravery of schwartz

hp hat story reminded frank hoover
who is one of the army of clothing
salesmen that goes out from the wholesale
district of broadway of another night-alarm
in a sleeping-car

   m levy  sons in bond street used to
have a chap traveling for them said hoover
 who was one of the finest self-advertisers on
the road his name was schwartz and with
his black beard his diamonds his lurid
waistcoats and swell clothes he put up a
wonderful front

   you could find him almost any day when
he was off the road in the lobby of the broad-
way central telling about the big things hed
done

   a fine fellow but an awful bluffer he
had a veritable passion for wanting to pose
as a hero and he was always telling some
story of an adventure in which he had dis-
tinguished himself for bravery

   one night schwartz and i got aboard
the worlds fair flier in chicago bound for
the st louis exposition

   on the same train was morris katz a big
st louis clothier schwartz stuck to katz
like a long-lost brother from the moment he
set eyes on him he made up his mind hed
sell him a bill of goods before st louis was
reached

   it happened that katz wasnt in a buying
mood that night but schwartz kept at him
sounding him to find his weak points
told in the smoker



                    

finally he got him going on the subject of
wild animals

   katz could talk all night about hunting
big game that is where schwartzs vivid
imagination proved valuable he told katz
how he had risked his life in hunting moun-
tain lions and of fights he had with western
desperadoes till katzs eyes fairly bulged
schwartz pleased him so much that he got a
six-thousand-dollar order with a good chance
of another after reaching st louis

  that was the night the worlds fair
flier was held up in illinois by masked ban-
dits a regular old-fashioned train-robbery
that was with the robbers going through the
sleeping-cars holding up the passengers at
the points of revolvers

   it was wonderful the way everybody
gave up of course the bandits didnt have
time to stop and search people yet there
were mighty few that didnt hand over
everything they had thats what i did i
gave up two hundred and a watch and i
went through every pocket to see that i
hadnt forgotten anything it makes a man
extraordinarily scrupulous when he sees a
revolver pointed at his head

   when the bandit who attended to us got
to the end of the car and was about to
leave he suddenly swung around to where
katz and schwartz were sitting hesitated
an instant then pointed his gun at the pair
and said did i get yours

    n-n-no sir stammered schwartz dig-
ging into his pockets  you missed us

   schwartz had only forty dollars and a
watch and was glad to get off so easily but
poor katz was heartbroken he had to
hand over a cool thousand in money and
jewelry worth half as much more he gave
schwartz a look of withering scorn

      you jackass  he hissed  ill take that
six-thousand-dollar order back and im
thinking of suing you besides

tn that great and new field of commerce
a south america hundreds of salesmen
from this country have been busy during the
last three or four years beating out new
paths of trade and some of them have been
having strange experiences to tell the home
folks about

  in every gathering place of commercial
travelers nowadays there is sure to be some-
body with a south american yarn for
example theres that story told by ralph

    	rr

kennedy who was sent down there last year
by a brooklyn hat factory

   it was in buenos aires said kennedy
and a great place that is too talk about
your live towns chicago is as tame and
peaceful as a cemetery after getting back
from there i suppose one reason is that
there are so many runaway crooks from the
 states  down there they set a pretty swift
pace for the sportive element

   one of the stores i visited was a pros-
perous looking place that sold about every-
thing that could be imagined in the line of
mens goods and carried a big stock of hats
i got a big surprise on discovering who the
proprietor was he had changed a good deal
and had grown a beard but i had known
him too well not to recognize him

  perhaps youve heard of taintor who
skipped out of new york with a big roll of
his firms money about ten years ago well
it was taintor who was running that store

   he was simply tickled to death to see
me too he threw his arms around me as
if i was a long-lost child i was the only
one of the crowd he used to chum with in
new york that he had seen in all those ten
years would he buy hats why it looked
as if hed have to mortgage his store to pay
for the order he gave me

   he couldnt do enough for me and i
couldnt tell him enough about new york
and the boys all that night we sat up and
talked about the old days he told me he
had made a lot of money down there and
was getting richer every year but he would
give every dollar he said to be able to get
back to new york and see the old faces and
the old places again

   he spoke of his father and his mother
and his wife all of whom had disowned him
after his fall and he didnt even wince
when he mentioned them though hed al-
ways been fond of his wife

   he could speak of his old -friends too
without a show of any very deep feeling it
seemed to me that he must have become
callous during his years as an outcast for
nothing seemed to move him

   at last we fell to talking of some of
our old meeting-places the favorite one
was tom noonans cafe in bleecker street
he had borne up like a man till then but
he had reached the limit the thought of
noonans was too much  he burt into
tears

  i cant bear to think of it he cried
 ive had the best times of my life there
with the boys	i

   so we changed the conversation back to
his wife and relatives and before long he got
his nerve back

 t et me tell you one said ed joyce
one of chicagos best cereal sellers
 it was down in an alabama town that i
heard this it seems that old major brown
one of the old southern gentry had been
away from his home for ten years attending
to a business in the north

   one day while walking about visiting
familiar spots he met lawrence an old col-
ored servant who was overjoyed to see
major brown again

    lawrence said the major in the
course of the talk  tell me what has become
of colonel trask 

  de colonel am dead sail

  dead you dont tell me  exclaimed
brown with some surprise  and hes buried
in our old cemetery 

yes sah hes done buried thar

  and my old friend john peters 

  well ise sorry to say sah went on
lawrence  dat massa peters am dead too 
john peters dead the major was
astonished  what on earth did he die of
lawrence 

  lawrence hesitated but finally mustered
up courage  dey do say sah dat like col-
onel trask he died of drink

  well-well mused major brown  mr
peters is buried too in our old cemetery 
 yes sah he is sure buried thar

    lawrence went on the major  tell me
about my old friend general watson

    general watson am dead too said
lawrence somewhat tired of the mortuary
recital

watson dead-dead the old major
could scarcely control himself  my oldest
friend pray what did he die of lawrence
  well sah dey do say sah dat he
drank liisself to death too 

  the old major was struggling with his
grief  and he too is buried in our old
cemetery lawrence 

  no sah answered lawrence dey
didnt xactly bury him sah dey just
poured him back in de barrel

he took the tickets

a bunch of old-time tra veling men were visit-
ing the other evening at a topeka hotel and
talk turned on to courageous conductors  i have
known

  a story was told on john becker for years a
conductor  the santa fe he was practically
awarded the palm for being the bravest  con 
who ever set foot on a through kansas train in the
old and perilous days

  one day just after the santa fe had left dodge
city becker passed through the car to take up the
pasteboards two cowboys had boarded the train
at dodge and becker went up to them and said
t-tickets please

  for an answer the cowboys whipped out big re-
volvers-the colts blue-steel brand -caliber and
replied

  here they are

   theyre good said becker quickly with a
deprecatory wave of his hand and he passed on
through the car the cowboys chucked their
irons back into their holsters and settled back
comfortably thinking that the train was theirs

  becker walked on back to his little wardrobe at
the front end of the next car and unlocking it took
out a sawed-off double-barreled shotgun loaded
with slugs he cocked both hammers-for it was
before the hammerless automatic days-and get-
ting the gun properly placed in front of him

he marched back into the car where the cowboys
were

  he stepped briskly in front of them and shoved
the big gun into their faces holding it at such an
angle that a shot would have swept off the heads of
both

  then he said again gently your tickets
please

  the hands of the cowboys twitched convulsively
toward their pockets and becker interjected  give
me those tickets please that have handles and
shove em at me with the handles toward me-to-
ward me understand he added bearing down
hard with the emphasis on me

  the tickets came across with the handles in the
requested direction

   now dig up the coin he demanded  to the
next station where we stop

  they dug

  now at the next station you fellows unload
understand   the sawed-off was still at a dan-
gerous location and the hammers still up

  the cowboys nodded vigorously in the affirma-
tive and they unloaded quickly and without words
at the next stop

  becker made no fuss over the matter didnt talk
about it at all he just accepted it as a part of the
days business and seemed to see nothing in it that
was extraordinary-kansas city journal

for growled sleepy sam you make me

he cant help shooting off his face and so

  which said sleepy sam does pete
proud in admitting that hes got such a thing
as a brain

   i rise to a point of order interrupted
loquacious louie if pete is prompted to
put in a record merely for the sake of stand-
ing before his own megaphone and hearing
himself vociferate i protest but if he can
slip in something that possesses the quality
of novel entertainment im no protestant
what you got on your mind pete
asked pugilistic patrick

  a couple of years ago began pete i
was doing some topographical research work
up in pennsylvania investigating the lay
of the land with an eye to the future lo-
cating havens of rest where a fellow might
secure three meals and liberty without the
consequent ennui of ringing up on the time-
clock

   it was hard work locating the burghs
that met the requirements and i was forced
to migrate continually most of my travel-
ing was done in the approved and conven-
tional way but at times i was forced to hit
the ties and indulge in pedestrianation-

  one day after shaking the dust of a
bum burgh from my clothes and the con-
stable from my trail i hit the railroad track
a few miles out and waited for the arrival
of my private car there must have been a
holiday on the line for nothing came along
and i was finally forced to locomote by my
own powers of locomotion

   after walking about five miles i dis-
cerned the sky-line of civilization in the dis-
tance about a mile away to one side of the
track were a number of low frame build-
ings completely surrounded by a solid board
fence

  a little farther on the village loomed
into view it was a fair-looking town judg-
ing from my point of vantage and i hoped
to add it to my list of eligible localities

   the sight of that likely looking burgh
put ginger into my halting footsteps and i
soon arrived at the outskirts there was a
string of cars drawn up on a siding along
the fence which surrounded the buildings

   i was wondering what kind of plant it
might be when on passing a place where the
string of cars was broken for about fifteen
feet i saw painted on the fence in huge
white letters against a black background

dangerous powder works

   i quickly put out my pipe which i was
smoking and stuck it in my pocket i had
no desire to start on an expedition in search
of the milkmaids up on the milky way


the railroad mans magazine

   work in the abstract has never ap-
pealed to me and how a man in the full
possession of his faculties can associate with
a job in a powder factory beats me

  just think fellows of working along for
five days with your eye on the clock cal-
culating how many more hours it is before
pay-day comes around and then when the
timepiece has only one more lap to go some-
body does a fool thing and the whole outfit
blows up sending you to kingdom come with
a full weeks pay uncollected

  i should think remarked loquacious
louie that a fellow would lose his nerve
after being in one of those places when it
blows up i cant understand how a fel-
low can get his courage together again and
resume work after the excitement is over

  it isnt a question of getting your cour-
age together its generally a question of
picking out and identifying your own ana-
tomical knickknacks said pete

   well i knew from hearsay that a pow-
der works is a sort of slumbering vesuvius
so i proceeded to disassociate myself from
the proximity i hot-footed it past that open
space in the string of cars as i was pass-
ing the last car in the bunch i happened to
look at it and i nearly jumped out of my
socks when i saw a thin wreath of smoke
coming from it

   i did a hundred-yard dash down the
track in record time then stopped i looked
around to see if i could locate any one who
was trying to qualify for the nobel cour-
age prize but the place was shy on candi-
dates

   somebodys got to get that car out of
there i told myself or theres a going to be
something doing in the noise line in my
excitement i called for help but there was
no answer then i realized that if any-
body was going to do the heroic it was up
to your uncle pete to get busy

   i ran back to the car and tried to open
the door but found it locked i thought that
if i could find out what the car contained
i could proceed more intelligently with the
first-aid stunt but it was a clean lockout so
i was forced to proceed along other lines

   i slipped in between the cars and un-
coupled the burning one from the next one
then looking around i spied one of those
pinch-bars that the train crews use for mov
ing dead cars along the track i got it and
tried to move that car along but it wouldnt
budge

  the smoke was pouring out in thick
volumes by this time and i realized that i

had to get it moving pretty soon or hustle
myself out of the danger zone i worked the
bar until i had a crop of blisters on both
hands but the fiery freight was as immov-
able as a tenement-house rent collector

   suddenly i made the startling discovery
that the brakes were set i ran around to
the front end of the car and climbing up i
quickly loosened the brake then climbing
down i rushed back and had that car go-
ing in no time

    after moving it along a few feet the car
started to run of its own accord and i
realized that there was a slight grade at that
point sufficient to allow it to travel by
gravity

  i ran ahead and swung aboard as i
climbed to the top the flames began to eat
their way through the roof at the rear end
i grasped the brake-wheel and spun it around
so as to get control of the car should the grade
get too stiff

   slowly my fiery chariot gathered speed
and by the time we struck the village we
were exceeding the speed limits as we struck
the crossing the watchman rushed out of his
shanty and made some unintelligible remarks
to me but i kept on going

    i tried to put on the brakes so as to bring
that luminous limited to a stop beyond the
built-up section of the town but i found that
the chain had got jammed being diametri-
cally opposed to hard work i quit the job
and let her slide back in the village i
could see the worthy inhabitants running
around and gesticulating wildly

   i looked ahead and saw that the track
was clear for a good stretch but i also saw
that it was down grade so that there was no
possibility of stopping on we rushed the
wind fanning the flames but fortunately for
me sweeping them rearward

    suddenly i heard a shrill whistle ahead
and i realized that an engine was on the
same track as my car it had stopped about
a mile off headed the other way

    heres where we make a sensational
finish i said to myself then i heaved a
sigh of relief as i saw the engine get into
motion and start down the track that fel-
low at the throttle certainly let her out some
but my pyrotechnical pullman kept gaining
on him steadily i grew interested in the
race and wished that i was close enough to
bet with the engineer on the outcome

  talk about the mountain of fame being
down hill on the other side that grade
had the mountain of fame looking level
slowly we gained on that engine ahead

   ahead in the distance another town
came into view and i wondered whether there
would be a reception committee to greet us

  that engineer seemed to get an extra
burst of speed out of his puffing engine as
we neared the town and just as he struck the
outskirts he slacked up and his fireman
jumped he ran back a short distance and
i saw him desperately trying to throw a
switch he got it over just in time and my
special left the main track

   i thought we had been going some before
but this new line that they had switched me
onto was in a class by itself the fellows
that laid that track must have worked on
ladders youve seen those gravity roads
where they pull trains up with a steel cable
and let them run down by holding them
back 

  well thats the kind of proposition i
was up against at the end of the track
about a mile down i caught a glimpse of a
river which seemed to be rushing up to
meet me and before i had time to get the
mental impression registered that car-load
of fire hit something and i made a long-
distance dive into the watery depths

   i hit the water and went down about
a mile when i came up and got the water
out of my eyes i struck out for the shore

   say pete interrupted loquacious louie
when and where did you learn to swim

  oh replied pete i learned to swim
before i cut my wisdom teeth i was born
on a canal boat well as i was saying i
struck out for the shore like a bullfrog going
a wooing the car had struck a bumper on
die rivers edge and the wreck was burning
fiercely by the time i pulled myself ashore
a crowd had collected to enjoy the fire

    say sport said a fellow who looked
like a railroad-man  whered you come
from 

    up by the powder-works about five
miles back i answered

    powder-works said the fellow  what
powder-works there aint no powder-works
within twenty miles of this place

    i guess i con read i replied  espe-
cially when the betters happen to be about
five feet high if that place isnt a powder-
works they ought to take in their sign

   the village constable pushed through
the crowd and asked the cause of the trouble
the railroad-looking fellow told him and
advised that he lock me up until they found

out how i came to be joy-riding around the
country

   the constable took me before the town
burgess when i told my story he seemed
to be favorably impressed

    there is one weak point in your story
he said  you claim that this car was stand-
ing alongside the powder-works but there
are no powder-works within twenty miles of
this place

    but i can take you to them i insisted
  all right he replied  how far is it
  about a mile straight up and five miles
back along the line i replied

     jake he said turning to the constable
 hitch up my team and well drive up i
havent anything particular on hand

  well we drove up and finally reached
the point where i had started my trip on the
combustible limited the pike ran along
the railroad tracks at that point and as
wfe came opposite the open space in the
string of cars  told jake to pull up his
prancing plugs

  there i said triumphantly pointing
to the sign  what does that mean  

  the judge and jake gave a look and
then burst into hilarious laughter

     gosh and hemlock  laughed the judge
when he could control himself  this sure
is a joke on you come on jake lets
take him over and show him and then ship
him back to missouri

  we all got out of the wagon and crossed
the railroad tracks they took me through
the open space in the string of cars and then
the cause of their hilarity broke upon my
astonished gaze

  painted along the whole length of the
fence in letters like the ones id read between
the cars was this

peachblow face powder
works wonders

 avoid the dangerous kinds

  when i recovered my faculties i put
distance between myself and that beauty-bul-
letin as i faded from the landscape i
heard an explosion in the rear but it was
only jake and the judge laughing

   quite a difference between face-powder
and the kind you was thinking of hey
pete   remarked loquacious louie

   oh i dont know replied pete they

takes them to his tent but the old indian is so seriously hurt that he dies and pierre is left with the
girl on his hands a half-breed and an indian appear at the camp this half-breed simon who
was the husband of anne maries sister but who through his brutality has killed his wife is in love
with the girl and tries to make pierre give her up this pierre refuses to do and the girl and he
scheme to escape in the canoe it seems impossible and finally anne marie whose injuries are
very painful endeavors to make simon swear on the grave of her father that he will protect her and
take her to the home of her cousin antoine simon promises but refuses to swear he insults
pierre and a fight ensues in which pierre succeeds in felling the half-breed and with the help of
the girl binds him anne marie after damaging simons canoe in such a way that it will take some
hours to mend helps pierre and the indian to pack their canoe and she and pierre start up the

possible but again pierre conquers the half-breed in a desperate hand-to-hand fight and he and his
companion are made to take a solemn oath to cease the chase anne marie develops a high fever
which promises to delay the two in camp for some time an inventory of supplies shows pierre
that they have enough to last them for about four weeks their journey is beset with sickness hard-
ships and lack of food

southeast and it was rather less cold than
for a few days back a little rain however
would make no-difference

  but next morning it was coming down in
torrents it was a regular deluge they
waited for some time and pierre decided
that he might as well carry some of the
things over anne marie had arisen some-
what stiff and lame and remained within
the tent as he started off with the canoe
on his return in less than half an hour
he was drenched to the skin

   i wouldnt mind starting he said
but im afraid a soaking would not be
very good for you it might be a good idea
to stay here to-day this rain wont last
forever and youre getting stronger all the
time in a few days it will not matter
whether you get wet or not

  she nodded impassively what did it
matter to her whether she went or not she
was happy and did not want to see the end-
ing of these days

   as you wish she said

reaching the portage

                 made camp in a jittle grove
                 re generations of indians
                 voyagers had left signs of
                 r temporary occupancy

 we havent gone very far
 said pierre as they were eating
 their supper but youve done better than i
 supposed you could are you very tired
 anne marie  

  no getting better fast im hungry
 too

  they laughed happily and enjoyed their
 meal to the utmost

well do still better to-morrow he said

she looked at the sky before answering

 much rain coming she announced

pierre looked up too and shook his head

 i suppose you know he said doubt-
fully  but i cant see any signs of it

there was a moderate breeze from the
a heart of the north



  but it is not as i wish id like to
start he put in rather impatiently  its
just for your good if you got thoroughly
wet and chilled now you might be ill again
of course you know best about these
things she answered quietly

  it really seemed as if they had decided
wisely for all day it poured frightfully
pierre took some more loads over the port-
age during intervals when there was a lull
in the storm and stored them under the
overturned canoe

   the river was rising fast

  big rains in the north remarked the
girl	

   yes it must have been coming down
for several days up there to be sure

  the next day to pierres intense disap-
pointment conditions were just as bad and
he decided to wait longer the girl was
evidently improving fast she seemed to be
casting away her illness and to be emerging
from it with renewed vigor

  but she was no longer idle now pierre
had a little package containing needles but-
tons and various spools of thread which
his mother had put up for him and anne
marie appropriated it for the common good
with strong waxed thread she repaired her
moccasins and their clothing showed various
rents that claimed her attention

  pierre was now the idle one lying down
in the tent and smoking his pipe while she
worked and no longer feeling the irksome
dulness he had experienced in the previous
big rain it seemed to him that he had found
a pleasant companion besides he was no
longer a prisoner kept in duress by the girls
illness

  he could have gone on if he had wished
to it made all the difference in fact he
was permeated by a strange peaceful sensa-
tion as of something homelike

  here he sat with his soft camp moccasins
on his feet and near him was a little house-
keeper radiating about her a certain charm
of her own he was thoroughly happy and
there was nothing incongruous in the thought
that came to him that they were there quiet-
ly enjoying life and that if some things had
been otherwise he might have chosen that
life and that woman for his own

  my goodness he suddenly exclaimed in
english  think of what the mater and
the old man would say 

  anne marie looked up

   i do not understand she said

  no you dont understand ou-memeou
probably you never will i had thoughts

that came out loud about things that are far

away

  yes i see she answered looking at
him gravely as though still seeking to fath-
om the unsolvable mystery of her chance
companion

   in his voice there was a caress to her
and in the mere touch of his finger some-
thing that made her heart beat and her
cheeks feel warmer she slowly shook her
head it was not to be understood

  the day passed and on the next it was
still raining but less hard and they decided
to start anne marie got over the portage
without any trouble she was wrapped up
in the water-proof ground cloth this she
had refused at first caring nothing for the
rain but pierre had insisted and she obeyed
as always

   they traveled all day with only one small
portage which was passed in a few minutes
the river was still rising and the current
becoming a powerful turbid flood often
in rapid places pierre would have hesitated
if the girl had not always known the proper
course with unerring instinct at times
she arose looked for a moment down the
stream and at once pointed with her hand
the canoe previously held back a little
would shoot forward pitch a few times over
waves caused by deeply sunken rocks and
glide into smoother water

  another day came and the rain at length
stopped but the sky was clouded and a cold
wind was bending the tree-tops when anne
marie came out of the tent she looked up
in the north with a serious expression

   maybe snow is coming soon she said
 we must not stop any more

    oh the snow wont hurt usk he replied
 and well be at lac st jean in ten days
 i will paddle she declared  i am
much stronger now

  he assented with a nod rather non-com-
mittal the fact was that she looked quite
well again she stood erect as an arrow
lithe and graceful and her breathing came
quietly easily as if nothing had ever been
the matter with her

  she was happy when she took a paddle
and knelt in the bow it seemed as if all
the hard days had been left behind

    i expect well never need all that meat
he asserted as they were gliding down a
stretcl of smooth water  i wonder whether
i might not leave some of it behind it
will be that much less to carry and well
get on so much faster

   no never leave food she answered


the railroad mans magazine

  a little over thirty miles were covered that
lay and on the following morning it was
very cold near the bank there was a little
film of ice over the water they made an
early start and pierre was surprised to see
how strongly the girl handled the paddle

  every half hour or so he wanted to change
sides and to relieve the cramp in his toes
and knees by shifting his position she al-
ways complied but never asked for a change
first with an easy sweep her arms moved
to and fro and whenever they changed their
direction or went down rapid places it was
a pleasure to see the skill tvith which she
directed the canoe

  this manner of traveling was easy-
there was a companionship in it a com-
munity of effort that was very pleasant at
the next portage she quietly put a good load
upon her strong young back and smiled
quietly when he remonstrated with her

  late that afternoon they came to a rapid
that could usually be easily shct in the
canoe ordinarily high water permits of
easier descent of bad places but here the
great rocks that were now just submerged
made great dangerous whirlpools

   a terre  cried anne marie giving a
deft sweep toward the shore

  having landed on the bank they descend-
ed it on foot for a few yards for a better
look at the wild water anrie marie studied
the situation and then shook her head

   it is not safe she said  the current
is too violent to enable us to keep clear of
the rocks now

  oh lets try it he said well get
through all right

 the canoe is small and heavily loaded
she answered but we will if you want to
she was deferring to him loath as usual
to pit her judgment against his but he
looked at her and smiled

   you know best child he said  come
on well carry over

  it pleased him to think that this queer
girl knew just what was best to do and yet
was willing to abide by his desires she
was plucky to the very bones of her and
danger existed for her only as something
that interfered with traveling and which it
would be bad woodcraft to run into

   there is no regular portage here she
said

  pierre took his ax and followed by the
girl went down to survey the best way he
cut down a few alders and saplings that
would have been troublesome and then re-
turned for the baggage

  they carried all the stuff down between
them leaving the canoe for the last with
the usual look around to see that nothing
had been forgotten he took it up and went
on followed by the girl who was carrying
the stove and by paddy who was always at
anne maries heels

  the way lay through a bit of fir and
spruce growth emerging into an alder cov-
ered bit and then leading along shore over
a hard rocky place where the footing was
none too secure

  to the left the water was boiling a very
caldron of wild tearing waves splitting
thunderously against the jagged rocks and
then smoothing down into great tourniquets
that deepened and filled up again at in-
tervals

  it was a grand sight and for a moment
pierre stood on a rock protruding from the
bank he then took a long step to reach
another stone but this moved under his
weight and he made a violent effort to gain
his footing farther on

  he reached it but with the toe of his boot
and slipped and in a moment the weight
upon his shoulders had borne him with a
crash into the wild water

  the girl shrieked as she saw him fall and
ran down as fast as she could she saw
him swept in the swirl of rough waters the
canoe had fallen away from him and he
made an effort to grasp it but it was whirled
out of his reach

  he struck for the shore but the crushing
weight of the water bore him under several
times he came up gasping but full of
fight and with a magnificent sweep of his
strong arms neared the shore a wave lifted
him like a feather and beat him down upon
a rock and his bod seemed to become sud-
denly limp

  a few yards farther down he was carried
among the branches of a big fir that had
fallen in the water with its roots still fast
to the bank

  anne marie leaped upon the trunk and
grasped him by his coat-collar pulling him
up with a strength that was marvelous to
behold he helped himself a little and
finally the two made their way to the bank
where he sat under a tree dazed with blood
flowing from a big cut upon his forehead

  nearly a fair knock-out he muttered
and then suddenly the matter of greatest
import came uppermost in his mind

   wheres the canoe  he cried his voice
torn with anxiety

  farther down out in the rapids the little
a heart of the north



craft had been jammed at the bow between
two rocks and the sweep of the current was
forcing the stern around they watched it
with beating hearts for it was like a living
thing that fought for its life

  in the roaring of the waters they heard
nothing but could imagine that it cracked
and moaned like a thing in pain gradually
the stern twisted around farther and farther
still resisting and suddenly something gave
way and the canoe broke in the middle and
as a flash became a misshapen object a mere
carcass a few ribs of which were sticking
out of the water which in a few minutes
would complete its work of destruction

  pierre had not felt the hurt he had re-
ceived he was not even aware that he was
shivering witii the cold and with the shock
to his nerves he merely sat there looking
at the sad wreck out in the boiling river the
significance of the accident gradually dawn-
ing upon him

   howll we get back now  he asked
despondently

  as he sat there the girl stood before him
mopping his bloody forehead with the red
handkerchief she had taken from around her
neck she had remained silent and even the
wreck of the canoe had taken her attention
for but a moment she was looking at him
thankful that his life was saved sorrowing
that he was hurt full of a deep concern for
him suddenly tears came in her eyes

   it is my fault she said  perhaps we
could have shot it from the other shore

  he looked at the wild water and shook
his head then his eyes fell upon her and
he saw her tears and at once the sturdy
strength of his forefathers came back to him

   never mind ma petite he said  we
might have been drowned

  he stopped to pat the dogs head paddy
had his forefeet upon his knee and was lick-
ing his hand

   come said anne marie  we must light
a fire and get dry

  he followed her casting another look at
the bit of wreckage still jammed between two
rocks and they quickly made their way to
where all their baggage lay piled up ready
for embarkation

  they had to open one of the bags to look
for matches for the few pierre had in his
pockets were soaked his teeth were chat-
tering with the cold but he took the ax and
chopped lustily a great fire was soon burn-
ing and its heat was grateful

  he stood before it warming himself while
the girl sought out his few spare clothes

while he put them on she boiled water for
tea and busied herself making camp she
did it more rapidly than he could have man-
aged it

  in her hands the little ax hastily fashioned
tent-pegs and before the kettle boiled their
little silken home was erected

  it pleased her to wait upon him and her
attentions were grateful he sat down by
the fire with one of the blankets wrapped
around him the wet clothes were hanging
on poles just near enough to the fire to dry
without burning the scalding hot cup of
tea she handed him comforted him greatly
his hat had disappeared in the river and
around his brow he wore the handkerchief
with which anne marie had stanched the
bleeding

  she attempted to lift one of the heavy bags
within the tent and gave a little cry of pain
it awakened him out of the sort of apathy
in which he had momentarily fallen

   dont move those bags anne marie
youre not strong enough for that sort of
thing yet

   i want to help she answered sadly

   youve helped enough ou - memeou
youre a better fellow in the woods than
most men ive traveled with well get out
of this mess somehow

  she was standing before him and he
smiled as he placed his hand on her shoulder

  then anne marie became happy again
for she cared not where she might lie or
what might happen so long as this man was
with her so she could do his bidding and
care for him and so she could share his hard-
ships

  when he had disappeared in the white
water her heart had stopped beating and she
had felt that her very life was being torn
away from her by the crushing waves that
were carrying off this man who was not like
other men

  blithely she went to work the ordinary
details of life must be attended to and a
meal had to be made ready

   dont bother he said  i can cook
supper

  and then for the first time she rebelled

   i am well now and strong it is the
womans work to cook and to work and to
carry what she can you have done all the
work these many days and now i want my
share i do not want to be despised

   youre a wonder ou-memeou please
yourself but if you get sick again dont
blame me

  he was laughing then and she laughed


the railroad mans magazine

too for she was happy to see him himself
again

    ill have a great story to tell my friends
he declared  after i get back to stones and
brick

  she did not quite understand the latter
part of his sentence but the mention of his
return to his friends seemed to hurt some
little sensitive fiber within her heart for she
bit her lip and turned away quietly yes
he would get away from this land of hers
back to men and women of another world
and she would see him no more

  yet it all seemed distant like the death
that comes to all or the end of the world
she had heard predicted it saddened her
but gave no acute pain it was one of the
hard things of life like the frost-bites of
winter and the hunger of barren places to
be endured when they come a part of exist-
ence

  for the rest of the day she turned her
hands to every bit of work she could find to
do he wanted to get away and she would
help to the utmost she owed him pretty
nearly all the kindness and gentleness she
had ever met with and was anxious to repay

  at one time she was sewing rabbit-skins
together and paddy came up to her his
master had wandered away in the woods to
set snares

  she took the dogs rough head in her
hands and put his cold nose against her
cheek

   you will go with him paddy and i will
be all alone she said

  but the dog only wagged his stumpy tail
and hearing his masters footsteps ran away
to him

  as it began to grow dark she spoke

   there are people waiting for you where
you live she inquired

   why yes my father and mother he
said  and im afraid theyll lie rather anx-
ious before they see me again

   no wife and little children 

   why no-im not married he laughed

  this seemed to cheer her up for some rea-
son that she did not fathom since strange to
say the idea had not at all materialized it-
self in her mind that this man could ever
lielong to her

  all that she knew was that she was happy
in his presence and that his going away
would be a miserable ending tc a life that
to her was full of an ineffable charm

  they had both avoided the problem of the
future but it had to be solved they could
not remain where they were and some means

of travel had to be devised as they sat
under the tent with the little stove burning
cheerfully pierre lit his pipe and began to
ask questions

   can we build another canoe anne ma-
rie i suppose you know how 

   yes i know but there is no birch-bark-
large enough in this part of the country
and it should be the bark of spring-time

   then what are we to do 

   if we had birch-bark it would take near-
ly two weeks she replied  we have no
couteau croche nothing but the ax and two
knives we must make a raft

  a raft-just the thing we will float
down

   hard work she continued  we must
make a new one at every portage

  true he answered we have enough
to carry without pulling logs over all the
carries

  we can shoot no rapids she continued
 and we must land before we get to the-head
of most portages

  yes theyre nearly all near swift water
he assented its lucky i got that meat
the young man was restless before he
slept that night he realized the difficulties
of a rafting trip down the river with the cold
weather coming on and the food question
becoming important again when he awoke
in the morning the girl was already out of
the tent cooking breakfast

  they had a bite to eat hurriedly and
pierre went to look for suitable trees and
picked out dead ones that would float light
but that were not decayed -there were plenty
of them and he cut lengths of about twenty-
five feet and carried them to the shore

  it took him a great deal longer to make his
raft than he had expected there was no
auger to bore holes with in order to peg
cross-pieces and he puzzled for some time
over the best way to fasten the logs solidly
together	-

  he split a young birch and made six pieces
about seven feet long of which he passed
three under his logs at right angles with
them while three were placed over them
all that was necessary was to fasten the pro-
truding ends strongly together to do this
he cut long strips from the caribou hide
that had been kept

  the morning was well advanced before
the clumsy craft about six feet wide and
twenty-five feet long was completed in
the meanwhile anne marie had made a big
paddle with his hunting knife and had cut
a couple of poles
a heart of

the north



  during all this time he had been working
up to his knees in the water and felt the cold
keenly he then went to work to load his
raft feeling somewhat uncertain as to whether
it would be buoyant enough but found that
all the equipment and provisions besides
their combined weight did not sink it too
deeply

   it bothered him to think that this job would
have to be repeated at every portage and at
many bits of rapid water that could easily
have been shot in the canoe but would prove
too shallow or too rocky for the raft with
practise the others might bebuilt more easily
but again he might not always find the right
sort of trees at hand or shallow water in
which to work

  his activities once aroused however he
easily became sanguine and felt quite cheer-
ful when they started the food question
bothered him only a little anne marie could
set snares for rabbits and catch fish while he
worked at his rafts

  he knew he could not count on any more
big game excepting by the greatest luck it
would be scarcer as they traveled farther
south well it was one more experience
another fight to be waged and he did not
doubt for a moment that he would win

  the waterproof ground cloth had been
stretched over the middle of the raft and the
dunnage piled upon it paddy ran from one
end to the other enjoying a method of travel
that gave him so much freedom

  they floated down easily though slowly
and anne marie constantly watched and
pointed out the places where the current was
softest it was of little use to try and
propel the raft for the greatest exertion of
pole and paddle made apparently little dif-
ference in their speed

  sometimes they had to observe the shore
carefully to see that they were progressing at
all and then with swifter water the raft
would go faster for a while and pierre could
not help thinking how rapidly they would
have traveled in the canoe

   its slow work anne marie he called
to the girl who was sitting forward

   we travel she answered  we are not
standing still the hours carry us nearer
to the end

  yes i suppose we are going home he
assented

  look out for the sand-bar she cried
pointing ahead

  the river was wide and the current slow at
this place and they were drifting over a
shallow spot they tried hard to push out

farther in the river but soon grounded
pierre jumped in the water less than a foot
deep and the girl did likewise

  the lessened weight made but little dif-
ference and inch by inch they managed to
push on for thirty or forty yards using their
poles as levers under the raft this took
nearly arthour and then they floated freely
again for a short time and became fast once
more the water was a little deeper how-
ever and by walking alongside and pushing
they made progress though very slowly it
took diem until nearly sundowm to get over
about a mile of shoals and into deep water
again

  how far to the next portage asked
pierre

   about three miles

   had we better go on  

   yes it is an easy landing with a sandy
place

  they went on while it grew darker and
darker and anne marie stood up ahead
watching

  we must cross the river she said the
portage is on the other side

  with poles and paddle they forced the
heavy raft over and finally made the landing
and unloaded it while anne marie made
camp pierre unfastened the knots and took
the lashings and the cross-pieces to use on
the next raft

  before eating in the semidarkness they
carried some of the things over the carry in
order to save time on the morrow

  weve got to work hard on land now
he remarked  and rest on the rafts when
the blessed things consent to float

       chapter x
       turning the tables

defore sunrise they labored hard car-
rying things over the portage anne
marie was becoming visibly stronger day by
day and insisted on doing some of diis w-ork
but after they had taken everything as far as
the lower landing - place they decided that
the water was too deep and rapid to permit
the building of a raft there they had to
make their way down the bank for quite a
distance through an awful tangle of alders
and brush before reaching a suitable place

  here it was quite a job to find the neces-
sary logs and the girl chopped down the
trees while pierre carried them to the bank
this accomplished the making of the raft
did not take very long
s

the railroad mans magazine

  they had risen in the dark at five and by
half-past nine they were able to load and
get started knowing that they would have
several miles of clear water before reaching
the next falls

  pierre had rigged up a mast a little for-
ward of amidship and the ground cloth was
fastened above to a crosstree while the lower
ends were tied to ropes these were carried
back and attached to the sides of the raft

  this did very well at the start but after a
couple of miles a change in the wind and
bends in the river rendered it useless and it
had to be taken down they had not been
able to see that at any time it increased their
speed very materially

  in this long stretch of the river the cur-
rent was quite slow notwithstanding the
high water and their progress was tedious
after a couple of hours the wind served them
again and they put up the sail once more
but it drove them hard over a shallow place
which it took them more than an hour to
clear and which they might have been able
to avoid if the sail had not made the steering
harder

  the day was a cloudy gloomy one and
before they were clear of the shoals it began
to rain they were soon soaking wet in
pushing the raft some of the crosspieces be-
gan to get loose and they had to be tied up
again pierre working with his arms under
water at noon they landed and took some
hot tea starting off again in the cold down-
pour

  by sundown they managed to reach the
end of their days journey at the next port-
age they were rather pleased having made
ten or twelve miles during the day as soon
as they were ashore pierre began to take
loads over the short carry making four trips
in all

  each time he was accompanied by anne
marie and they camped at the lower end
but when he stopped pierre was utterly ex-
hausted for some reason the tump-line
seemed to strain his neck as it never had
done before and on each trip he had to put
down his load several times owing to the
pain he was compelled to sit down under
the tent while anne marie made tea and
cooked

  he fell asleep as soon as he had eaten
feeling quite played out but awoke soon
with an awful pain in his neck and back
and during the remainder of the night he
slept no more he was feverish and restless
and tossed about though aware that every
movement increased his agony

  although trying hard not to disturb the
girl she awoke and he was so ill that it was
a comfort to hear her stirring and to have
her ask what the matter was

   you have worked too hard she said
 and now you have the pains that come from
being wet all the time

   yes i suppose its some sort of rheuma-
tism he said  but you cant help me
girl and you had better try to go to sleep
again

  but she would not hear of this and went
out in the darkness and the rain to get wood
and he heard hex chopping then she came
in with several armfuls of heavy sticks and
cut them again in the tent to get dry kin-
dling she soon made a fire in die stove
placing wet sticks on top of it in order to
dry them a little

   his teedi had been chattering and the fire
was comforting anne marie unfastened a
few buttons of his shirt and rubbed his neck
gently as she sat by him in the dark with
only occasional tiny bits of light that came
from the half-opened door of the stove it
soothed the pain to some extent but after a
while it was as bad as ever and he could
hardly bear it

   why dont you take some of die medicine
you gave me to make me sleep when i had
the bad pain in my side   she asked him

  he had not thought of that and she man-
aged to find the little case widi the tiny vials
she lit their remaining candle fora few min-
utes during which she handed him the little
bottles one by one

  he selected the proper one and took two
of the tablets it was very long it seemed to
him before he could get asleep most of the
time he was lying in a semiconscious state
aware of the pain but not feeling it much
he remained quiet however and after sev-
eral hours anne marie who had been watch-
ing him in the dark also fell asleep

  when he awoke the sun had been up at
least an hour but could not be seen for it was
still raining anne marie was not in the
tent the pain was not quite as bad as it
had been during the night but when he tried
to sit up he found it quite impossible

  all the muscles of his back seemed to be
stiffened into sensitive masses he called
but the girl did not answer and suddenly
the idea came into his mind that he had been
forsaken that she had gone and left him
alone in his helplessness and misery but
he realized the absurdity of the thought

  all the provisions were there under the
tent he waited patiently and even dozed
a heart of the north



again for some minutes being conscious of a
disagreeable heavy feeling in his head and
a sick sensation in his stomach probably due
to the opium

  he smiled at her when she finally came in
dripping with her long black hair hanging in
strings over her face it seemed to him as if
never in his life he had felt so glad to see
any one but when he tried to move one of
his arms there was a terrible aching in his
shoulder and the hand dropped down

  you are awake she said do you
feel better

   its my turn now anne marie i cant
move what awful luck

  you will be all right again in a few
days she answered soothingly

   a few days  he cried out  wont i
be able to travel to-morrow am i going to
be tied up here by this deuced pain im
willing to keep still to-day but to-morrow i
go do you hear  

  he was impatient and restless and spoke
roughly as if she had been at fault

  you may still be too sore to go on to-
morrow she ventured

  i dont care-ill go to-morrow but just
now i simply cant move where have you
been  

   fishing she answered

  oh youve been fishing have you he
retorted angrily  i hope youve had some
fun

  he was quite indignant she was fishing
while he suffered while he needed her she
should have remained near him

  we need provisions she replied gently
we have to save now

  from the hem of her rough skirt the water
was dripping her face was glistening with
the wet-she was quite soaked through

  you poor girl he exclaimed contrite-
ly  im sorry i said that

  impulsively she knelt by him and lifting
one of his hands in her own she stroked it
as if he had been a child

  you are too good she said it is my
turn to work for you

  for some reason he could not explain this
made him feel uncomfortable but her sym-
pathy was good and comforted him

   did you catch any fish   he asked
  yes three dorec she answered

  he smiled and the girl arose to get break-
fast for him she brought him some boiled
fish and a cup of tea he enjoyed the hot
drink and tried to eat a little but he had no
taste for food

  that day was desperately long and slow

anne marie went out again several times to
look at her lines and to set rabbit-snares but
she never remained away long and when-
ever she returned he was pleased to see her
and glad of her presence

  on the next day he was quite unable to
move the girl rubbed his neck and shoul-
ders and sat by him most of the time sew-
ing skins together or mending clothes he
liked to have her there to talk to him and
wait on him and whenever she went away
even for a short time he longed for her com-
panionship several times he became grumpy
and impatient but she did not appear to
notice it

  five days in all passed away before he was
able to move about and then he determined
to start at once the weather had become
clear and cold and winter was announcing
its near arrival he took his ax and went to
work to make logs for the raft but had to
stop before he had half cut down a dead
spruce whose top rested on some birches upon
which it had fallen

  anne marie quietly took the ax from him
and he sat down feeling piteously weak and
disabled after she had made the logs he
arose again to help her take them down to
the waters edge he remembered how the
week before he had swung them upon his
shoulder and carried them so easily

  with the girls help she doing most of
the work he managed to get three of them to
the shore and then sat down exhausted he
persisted however but it took till evening to
get the raft made anne marie went up to
her knees in the water to tie the crosspieces
together he had angrily forbidden her to
do so but she came to him and placed her
hand on his shoulder and smiled

  you are the sick one now she asserted
gently  i am well and strong and more
used to this life than you please let me
work

  she had jumped in the water without wait-
ing for his consent and tied her knots more
strongly and deftly than he had done they
fastened the raft solidly to the shore ready
for the next days journey

  when they started their loadwas in-
creased by a few pounds of smoked fish and
some rabbits the next carry was not very
far away and when they landed pierre found
himself unable to carry heavy loads the
muscles of his head and neck resented the la-
bor demanded of them twenty-five or thir-
ty pounds was all that he could manage at a
time anne marie took his tump-line with-
out heeding his protests lifted full a hun-


the railroad mans magazine

dred pounds to her broad little back and
walked off with it

  it is too much for you he objected

   i have had much rest she replied  i
think sometimes you forget i am a savage
i have carried ever since i was a little girl
we take babies first then food and traps
and later on babies again but with heavier
loads besides and we paddle and skin and
cook and then we grow old and die

  she spoke simply as one knowing that no
other life was possible for her kind and car-
ried her load willingly because that was one
of the functions of the women of her race
and she was always surprised when pierre
tried to save her from too much toil

  what was there in life beyond this as
she walked on bent under her load she
fancied that if this man had always been
with her the labor would have been light
and easy its weariness nothing when shared
with him when rewarded by a word from
him this kind of idea frequent with her
now was yet shapeless and unformed

  principally she was like paddy conscious
merely of present happiness but unlike him
she was made uneasy by the knowledge that
it would not last and a chilly feeling would
strike through her heart and the load upon
her back then seemed to crush her in a
strange way

  at the lower end of the carry a small
stream entered the river and they had to
get across it to find trees for a new raft it
was quite deep and turbulent as a result of
the recent rains and they had to travel up its
banks for some time before they found a
place where they could get over it

  it took them over two hours to get all their
things across and back again to the main
shore they had more trouble in making
this raft than they had experienced before
suitable trees were rather far apart and the
shore lent itself but poorly to the building
of their craft

  they had to keep the logs together by
sinking poles a couple of yards out into the
river-bed as the current threatened to carry
them away it was a hard job to tie on the
crosspieces after this was done the bag-
gage had to be taken down a slippery bank
where their feet sank deeply in greasy blue
clay

  for a mile after they started they went at
a good pace and then they reached a place
where there were several islands and entered
a tortuous channel between two of them

  after going a hundred yards they found
the passage barred by a huge tree that had

fallen across it as soon as they saw it they
dug their poles in the bottom of the river to
stop their headway

  the tree was too large to make it practical
to cut it in the middle and they had to go
back against the current to find another way
the water was rather deep and though not
very swift it took them a long time and
much strenuous labor to push their clumsy
ship up-stream until they reached another
passage

  when they stopped they were both quite
exhausted and glad indeed to sit on the
raft again and direct its course with poles
and paddles down the unending river every
fall and rapid of which had become an enemy
to their progress instead of a thing of beauty

  that night when they stopped they had
only managed to make about seven miles
it was radier discouraging

   at this rate it will take us till christ-
mas said pierre rather gloomily

   we will have ice and heavy snow long
before that replied anne marie  but we
will have better days than this to-morrow
we reach the forks and then there are hardly
any carries all the way to tschotagama
only shallow places at times and some swift
waters

       chapter xi
       the toil of travel

tn the next ten days they made nearly two
hundred miles the weather had be-
come stormy and during all that time they
lived night and day in wet clothes several
light flurries of snow had betokened the need
for haste everything was saturated ex-
cepting die contents of the waterproof bags

  they had to build several rafts while at
other times they could unfasten the logs and
float them over shoals and tie them together
again lower down they passed long ex-
panses of barren land abandoned by beasts
and birds and this dreariness corroded
pierres soul but the girl though usually
grave and taciturn always stood by him do-
ing her work with such courage that he could
not help admiring her

  he felt that she had become a splendid
pal and prompted by an affectionate nature
the young mans conduct toward her daily
became more friendly

  he always called her ou-memeou or
translated the word in french and addressed
her as tourterelle often while standing up
on the raft and discussing the all-important
a heart of

the north



matter of where the deepest water was ahead
his hand would rest upon her shoulder for a
minute as she pointed to some spot on the
river

  slowly unconsciously he began to feel that
he would be sorry to end the trip as a
journey it certainly was beastly hard but
there was a keen enjoyment in the presence
of that girl and in the fact that he realized
he was becoming under some subtle influ-
ence a stronger and better man

  if she had only been of his race he would
have taken her to his heart with all her
poverty and ignorance of his world of that
world to which he still was tied and that
bound him with conventions too strong to be
severed he sometimes spoke of his life in
the cities and ou-memeou seemed always
eager to hear about it

   i should like to see such places she said
once  but it must be very dreadful to be al-
ways away from laughing waters and from
the song that comes out of the woodland

  you would die tourterelle he an-
swered  if you were caged in a city it is
not for a little wild bird like you

   but you you love the forest why do you
stay in those towns 

   why ou-memeou  i cannot tell why
except that my people live there

  and he pondered long over this in silence
as they floated on the river and the question
kept on recurring and at times he felt that
he knew not really why whether the blood
of farquhars wife beckoned to him or real
love was preparing him or the glory of the
wilderness appealed to him he could not tell
he knew that the girls cjuery was daily be-
coming harder to answer and gradually he
felt that one bond was becoming looser and
that another was tightening around him

  just as the flood carried them down so he
seemed to be upon a current that led away
from his old life not toward wealth or ease
but toward something else-greater stronger
better suited to the thews and sinews of a
real man

  although they had long sleeps and a suf-
ficiency of food they became haggard and
worn with the weary grind of it all anne
marie now did her full share of all the work
and it seemed to tire her less than her com-
panion

  at any rate she did not seem as exhausted
when night came pierre became used to the
idea of her working so hard and was glad
to have her attend to the dreary labor of
cooking and cleaning the few dishes they had

  the flour-bag was very low now and they

cooked no more bread sodden pancakes
made in the frying-pan were more filling and
easier to prepare they hardly caught any
fish and the rabbits seemed few and far be-
tween though they set snares nearly every
night

  paddy was dispirited he had grown thin
and lanky although he had always received
his full share of food never did he seem
now to bark for the very joy of living as
formerly his rather discriminating appetite
had given way to a wolfish hunger for any-
thing that could possibly be eaten

  the two sometimes remained nearly the
whole day without speaking the hardship
of it all had deprived the man of none of
his pluck but his endurance was sapped to
some extent and he went ahead doggedly

  along some portions of the river they had
to make paths for themselves where they
dared not trust a raft in the rapids that would
so easily have borne a canoe knowing that
the striking of a single boulder would mean
the loss of all the provisions and possibly
their own death on such occasions anne
marie always went first

  she had an instinct that always enabled
her to select the easiest going but the best
was seldom even fair there were stretches
of swamp in which they sank to their knees
and tangles of trees harvested by the great
north winds and burnt lands so covered
with an abomination of low growth and
charred fallen trunks that it took them hours
at times to make a few hundred yards

  these dreadful journeys had to be repeat-
ed until dicir whole equipment was transport-
ed little by little they had discarded
everything that was not absolutely necessary

   theres no use in lugging these steel
traps anne marie he had said  i know
theyre about all you own in the world but
after all theyre not worth much ill get
you others when we get to lac t jean

  anne marie had flung away the traps and
pierre had thrown away most of his ammu-
nition and fishing tackle his little mirror
went also his shaving things

  finally they reached a place only about
ten miles above where the peribonka ma-
king a graceful sweep allows some of its
waters to run off to the left and fill lake
t schotagama

  theres a way down the lake and into
a river all the way to chicoutimi i under-
stand said pierre

   if the wind was right we could sail a

raft down through the lake said the girl

but the river is small and bad

                                              f


the railroad mans magazine

  yes i suppose we had better keep on
down the peribonka he replied well
le all right when we get down to the first
falls there we can get provisions and
after that we can float down to the mouth
of the river and get a steamer or find
horses

  from here with a light canoe we could
go down in two days or a little over said
the girl

   id give five hundred dollars for one and
say thank you he asserted

  november had come and the next day
there was quite a fall of snow for an hour
or two it came down quite heavily a dry
feather cloud that whirled thickly over
them so that they could see but a short dis-
tance ahead and which after it passed off
left the mantle of winter upon the ground

  pierre thought of the joys of boyhood
when the first coming of snow spoke of win-
ter sports it would send him to- the loft
where skates toboggans and snow-shoes had
been put away during the summer

  but this time when the downy flakes
first came he had stared at the girl sha-
king his head and she had looked at him
they had gone through so much and now
this seemed like another obstacle rising up
before them a harbinger of cold they were
ill prepared to meet of ice that might inter-
fere with their journey and perhaps of
hunger whose pangs they might soon have
nothing left to appease

  were in for it he said

   we must spare a day or two and fix
things for cold weather she answered

  between them they had a double blanket
and four single ones and anne marie went
to work with pierres knife and cut out some
pieces with which she mnade rough mitts
the provisions had dwindled enough to
permit of their being packed in two of
the waterproof bags with their little spare
clothing

  this left two empty ones in which they
made a slit in the bottom and armholes at
the sides they could be drawh over the
head like pouches and would keep out the
water and wind but this left a lot of stiff
unyielding material around the neck and
the girl cut some of it away and did a bit
of clever sewing what was left of the cari-
bou hide ill-prepared though it was served
to make two pair of mocassins

  this took nearly a whole day for pierre
could give but little help the waterproof
bags worn over their clothing would keep
their bodies warm but the arms would suf-

fer and so they attached sleeves made of
blanketing

    in the evening and all that night the cold
 increased and in the morning it was freez-
 ing hard they had to break ice near the
 shore to get away and the water froze on 
 the poles and covered the raft with ice wher-
 ever it splashed upon it

   it was a very sudden coming of winter
 weather if this cold were to last he river
 would soon freeze over

   pierre noticed that the girl was less well-
 protected than she should have been her
 winter clothing had been lost in the wreck
 of her canoe and she possessed but a thin
 woolen skirt a large piece of the blanket
 that had already been cut into was left and
 he insisted that she should make a pair of
 trousers for herself out of it

she worked while they floated down the
river and in the evening when they landed
by early morning she had finished a rough
garment the stove going at night would
keep them comfortable in the tent

   they reached lake tschotagama before
 dark and pierre pushed the raft out of the
 strong current turned to the left and en-
 tered the narrow opening into the lake on
 the right side there is a little bluff twenty-
 five or thirty feet high upon which they de-
 cided to camp

   this was the usual limit of tourists jour-
 neys up the river and they found plenty of
 traces of former occupancy a large tree
 had been broadly blazed and some names
 were penciled upon the white wood

   it seemed like getting in touch again with
 civilization to find that these men from new
 york and other big cities had been fishing
 there unless several empty whisky bottles
 strewn around the site of the camp had in-
 terfered with this pursuit but pierre felt
 disgruntled to think that if he had a canoe
 he could easily have been down to the first
 falls in two days

   a survey of the remaining provisions left
 him somewhat anxious they would last
 at the present rate perhaps eight or nine
 days more although there was a good deal
 of tea there were ten falls below lake
 tschotagama besides some rapids over
 which they would not be able to take a raft
 each one of these meant the building of a
 new craft and they had discovered that on
 an average they could not make more than
 one a day and do any traveling also

   if the river were to freeze over they
 would have to walk this would be easier
 and faster than rafting if the ice should be
a heart of the north



solid but they knew that it would take a
long time to make it fit to bear their weight
for long distances though it would interfere 
with the raft

  wherever the water was rapid they would
have to walk alongshore for in such places
the ice would not make till late in winter

  as they had their supper under the tent
that evening pierre suggested that they
might have to tighten their belts before they
reached their destination but anne marie
shrugged her shoulders declaring she had
often gone hungry and diat it did not mat-
ter so long as one did not die

  the young man could not help admiring
her she was made of a stuff that differed
in every way from the material out of which
the greater part of the women of civilization
were built suffering hunger cold hard
toil all these were accepted by her as the
natural incidents of life

  she was pleasant and helpful appearing
to have no ambitions and no desires that
could not be easily satisfied she was strong
and willing and seemed to be grateful for
the smallest thing that was done for her
her intelligence was undeveloped along
most lines that formerly he had deemed
essential but what a companion she was in
the woods ay she was a fit mate for a
man	

  by the fitful light of the little stove he
looked at her she was sleeping peacefully
upon her side her fine features seemed to
him a new and interesting sight it did not
appear to him that he had ever studied them
before she had at first been to him a poor
sick thing like an ailing dog and he had
done for her as much as he would have done
for any suffering being

  she had even as belonging to another
race and another world for a long time
hardly appeared to him as a woman but
merely as some thing entitled to kindness
and now he thought of her as a companion
and as a mother of men and through his
heart there passed a pang a desire that
things might have been otherwise that his
existence might have been thrown among
her people and in her land

  sleep came to him at length but he
dreamed a great deal and in his visions
saw himself walking hand in hand with ou-
memeou the dove toward blue and purple
hills and farther white mountains and
along transparent lakes and singing rivers
and through forests whose aspens and
birches whose pines and spruces murmured
sweet things and spread carpets of leaves

   	rr

and needles before them redolent of the
scent of the wilderness

  during the night a rabbit was caught in
their snares and they had it in the morning
for breakfast with plenty of hot tea it did
not make a big meal for two and a dog but
they decided it would have to do and they
enjoyed the luxury of being able to start
without making a new raft the tempera-
ture was still lower and along shore the film
of ice was thickening and widening

  they made the seven miles to the next
carry in less than three hours and after
portaging all their stuff began anodier raft
it was no sooner finished however than it
began to snow so hard that they decided it
would not be safe to travel

  they could not see twenty feet before them
and it would not do to run chances of being
carried down rapids without being able to
guide themselves or even down the big falls
at the chute a mcleod

                                                          

  at dusk the snow ceased but it began
again in the morning coming in wild flur-
ries with a high wind their raft was sunk
deep with the ice that had formed on it
pierre worked hard to clear it of the snow
that covered it with the blade of a paddle
and to chop the ice off

  they finally started and traveled a couple
of miles by that time there were several
inches of snow on their craft and the poles
were so thickly covered with ice that they
could hardly handle them when they sought
to make the shore it was so thick that they
could not land for some time until they
reached a place where the water was swift
near the bank

   its no use anne marie the ice makes
so fast that we cant handle the raft any
more he told the girl  unless it gets less
cold well have to travel along the bank and
take the river when we can

  they were so cold that they stopped to
make tea and finally decided to stop for
the remainder of the day the flurries of
snow continued to fall and they had a hard
time making camp

  they had landed in a desolate place full
of rocks upon which a scanty number of
small trees eked out a precarious living the
raft was anchored by tying it with a rope
and for greater safety two poles were driven
in the bottom of the river between the logs

  in the morning it was still there but it
took long to chop it fairly clear of ice it
did not seem very buoyant and with much
trouble he added two more logs to it a short
time after starting they reached a dead water


the railroad mans magazine

whose whole surface was so covered with ice
about an inch thick that they had to stand
up and break it down with their poles to make
a channel

   the cold has come said anne marie
no more warm days there will be no
more drifting down the river

  when the got through the ice they floated
down another mile or so in swift water and
brought up hard against a sand-bar they
worked a long time to clear it but unsuccess-
full- and had to walk to the shore through
seven or eight inches of water their heavy
loads making their feet sink deep in the sand
nearer land they came to ice through which
they often broke but as there were only a
few inches of water they got no wetter than
they already were pierre had carried the
dog fearing that a prolonged ice-water bath
might injure it he left him on shore with
anne marie and returned for the rest of the
things rwhen he got back there was no more
sensation in his feet

  anne marie had lighted a fire and they
took off their moccasins and rubbed their feet
with snow pierre was slightly frost-bitten
he suffered keen pain by the time he put on
his spare stockings and shoes

  after having tea and a little of their
precious meat they started to make their way
along the shore the snow was soft and not
so deep as to make the walking very trouble-
some excepting in little drifts all their lug-
gage was now contained in two packs pierre
carried about sixty pounds and anne marie
little less their progress was twice impeded
by streams they had to cross and after get-
ting over them they came to a high bank run-
ning parallel with the river up which they
had a hard climb

   if we could only find a place with lots of
game said pierre we could wait till the
river froze hard and walk on it as often as
possible then wed make good time

  no game here said the girl except a
few rabbits and partridges

  in the morning it was still very cold the
lakes must all be freezing over but the swift
rivers took longer one of pierres feet hurt
him a good deal but he paid little atten-
tion to it the bad going and the constant
changes of direction in order to avoid rocks
windfalls and deep gullies wore into the soul
as the tump-line ground itself into his fore-
head

  at times it seemed as if they were in a vast
prison from which they sought to escape with
ball and chain tied to their feet their loads
ground them down into the hard surface

  pierres muscles now resisted the wear and
tear of the labor well and he only felt sore
and tired as often before but there was a
mental strain due to the uncertainty of the
thing to the consciousness of insufficient prog-
ress of scanty food of the thought of the
anxiety of the old people at home who knew
not where he was as he had only said he was
going in the lake st john country for a trip

  these trains of thought came from time to
time and made things worse anne marie
by common consent was the pathfinder and
he trod behind her in a quiet weary yet
plucky way his senses were merely dull
with the stupid grind of it all but he never
was the first to call for a rest

  at what seemed to be very regular inter-
vals she would stop and lean her pack upon
a fallen tree or a boulder without taking the
tump-line from her forehead and usually in
silence they would wait a while until the
pain seemed to have left their strained mus-
cles

  yet the- knew it would return as soon as
they lifted their loads again during these
stops pierre generally lit his pipe but some-
times he felt too tired to smoke he had an
immense amount of reserve force and pluck
left but his fairly easy life had never made
such demands upon him before he had
never really known what it was to bend his
muscles day in and day out to a strenuous
task and to take it up again and again with-
out surcease

  ou-memeou was not more effective than he
excepting in that her greater knowledge of the
woods made her his superior in traveling but
to her the work was not so irksome it was the
life she knew the only life she had ever known
-harder at one time than at another but such
as was necessary indispensable and from
which none of her people escaped

  from morning till night the hours of toil
went on each interrupted by a couple of short
rests apparently impassable places would
be reached and they would consult in a few
words

  sometimes they dropped their packs and
explored but nearly always the girl discov-
ered the best way around the obstruction
this sort of thing gave their heads and backs
a rest yet was unwelcome it kept them
back it interfered with the grinding toil that
after all constantly brought them nearer to
their destination they were seldom in sight
of the river as there was hardly ever any fair
walking along the sliore but the girls sense
of direction was never at fault

  at first pierre argued with her at times
a heart of the north



and insisted that she was mistaken but it
always turned out that she was right and after
a while he entrusted the whole matter to her
ljlindly following her grimly and uncomplain-
ingly his mind often occupied with triviali-
ties which somehow lessened the toil

  toward evening when they began to think
of making camp he reckoned that they had
been traveling for nine hours the actual
walking had taken perhaps seven of these and
the rests including a midday stop for lunch
would account for two

  if they had been going in a straight line
they would have covered about fourteen miles
but he thought of all the turns they had
made around obstructions of many kinds and
feared it could not be more than ten

  just then they came out upon the shore
again and anne marie looked intently seek-
ing to recognize the place

  in a moment she said she knew where they
were

   how far have we gone anne marie  he
inquired

   about eight miles reckoning the course
of the river she answered  we are not far
from mcleods portage

  he knew she must be right and that the
pace had really been very slow with their big
loads and the dreadful country they had
traversed he was too tired to feel more than
a slight disappointment they threw down
their packs and made camp

  the three birds were skinned they were
not very fat and hardly made a meal for two
people and a dog more food had to lie added
from their store yet it was a saving for which
they felt grateful

  the sky was leaden and promised more
snow but the fire was cheerful and comfort-
ing as they sat close to it and life did not
seem so very dreadful just then

  the hard work and the cold had made
them ravenous and now with full stomachs
and a hot fire before them they sat in a semi-
torpor that was pleasant with his old pipe
in his mouth pierre again looked upon ex-
istence as-a thing worth being blessed with

  he had followed the girl who now sat con-
tentedly by him the whole day long allow-
ing her to lead realizing that in the woods
she was his superior considering her smaller
size and weaker muscular power she was
doing the better part of the work

  this interest in her was constantly growing
yes he admired her she was becoming an
object of more intense thought to him with
every days journey

	t o b e c

   he caught himself staring at her several
times and this apparently made her uneasy
for she kept her eyes cast down in silence

   during the night there was another heavy
snowfall and when they started again the
walking was worse than ever but they were
pleased to see that the river was freezing over
more solidly this could easily be seen in
spots where the surface had been swept clean
by the wind

   they ventured out upon it cautiously step-
ping gingerly through the snow

    it is pretty strong said pierre  i sup-
pose we ought to pray for colder weather to
enable us to travel on the ice it would not
take us long if we could follow the river

   two more days of this cold would do
replied the girl

   once or twice the ice under their feet gave
out a sound of cracking like faint pistol-
shots and they returned to shore

   resuming their loads which were becoming
sadly lighter they set out again through the
woods

   that morning they had again weeded out
the bags and found a few objects that they
could spare and which they abandoned

   they plunged through heavy drifts and at
times in the forest found the ground nearly
bare in the open the snow was slightly
crusted but they broke through this and it
made awful going

   in the swamps the water was frozen quite
solid and as they no longer sank in the soft
ooze their progress here was easier it was
again a dreary grind but for some time they
felt better than they had the day before for
it was colder and the sky had cleared

  the snow was dry and crunched loudly
under their feet pierre thought that the tem-
perature must be near zero for the cold
nipped their hands and feet and their breaths
went out in white puffs paddy sometimes
would flounder badly but was plucky and
worked himself out and soon found out the
wisdom of walking quietly in the tracks made
by his master and the girl

   there were so many twists in the river
from which they did not date to go too far
that they were compelled to make many turns
and it took all day to reach mcleods portage
but a few miles farther on

   they camped here in the bitter cold and
went on in the morning as soon as the light
permitted the portage ran over a high hill
it was hard walking but the path was plain

   once below the falls however they had to
take to the wilderness again

the rogers group no 

the superintendent
of motive power

by robert h rogers

in his previous papers in this series mr rogers dealt with the more subordi-
nate railroad officials in this article the concluding one in his series he
presents a study of the superintendent of motive power among the men
who rapidly sway the destiny of a transportation system to either success or fail-
ure whose moves foretell whether passenger and freight receipts are to go on
climbing or whether the vampire of careless management and higher operating
expenses shall result in the downfall of a once prosperous corporation the su-
perintendent of motive power is some pumpkins he is ranked with the master
spirits of railroading the president the general manager and the board of
directors look to him for new and original ideas and up-to-date methods for
increased efficiency of operation

an important position which can be successfully filled only by a leader
of men who is also a mechanical genius and a
master of details

his is the elevation which to the
tyro and even those in the busi-
ness who should know better
savors of terrapin on toast pop-
ping corks and luxury amid
the sumptuous environment of a
palatial private car from whose velvet-up-
holstered depths the occupant waves through
the smoke of a dollar cigar indulgent per-
mission for the sun to go on shining a
somewhat fanciful thought perhaps but it
embodies nevertheless how some misguided
persons picture the superintendent of motive-
power or mechanical superintendent call
him what you will

it has always been an imposing position
to the subordinate official for the reason

began in the april railroad mans

that a car goes with it the true appeal of
the private car is too subtle for definition
but it is the most impressive spectacle about
a railroad and it is not necessary to remain
among railroaders to hear its mention as
synonymous with all the good things of life

  they are wrong-all whose thoughts fol-
low such lines of reasoning these cars are
nothing but traveling offices-workshops in
reality and far removed from anything like
real comfort

  the principal passenger would much pre-
fer to use the regular train service of the
road while on his rounds and does so ex-
cept on occasions wherein the length and
scope of the journey render such procedure
prohibitive then he takes his car

the superintendent of motive power



and keeps from dropping a week behind in
his office-work

  there is little pomp and circumstance
about the position although this assertion
may serve to cast doubt on another cher-
ished illusion the oft-quoted big head can-
not be properly associated with this grade in
the service because the previous schooling
has been too leveling the heartless past has
vouchsafed too varied an occupancy of houses
built on the sands for the cultivation of os-
tentation and one only needs to step aboard
any one of these cars which are to be found
pushed into clear around some terminal in
order to make sure

   you will have far less trouble by the way
in effecting an entrance than if you applied
at the superintendents headquarters in the
general office-building as formality is large-
ly waived and people are coming and going
all the time your ear however will not be
pleasingly greeted by the noise of the afore-
mentioned corks instead it will be assailed
by the click and rattle of typewriters and
you are more liable to stumble over a bunch
of file-cases than you are over a velvet divan

  over there in the corner is the man you
are looking for and many tilings about him
are apt to belie the conception of your ideals
they totter in presence of the fact that while
running his eye and pencil over a big blue-
print spread voluminously over a temporary
drawing-board he is munching a plebeian
cheese sandwich instead of the delicacy men-
tioned at the beginning of this article

a democratic individual

  more than likely he is attired in an old
frayed coat with the elbows out and a
scotch cap pulled over his eyes a parody
somewhat of the part you had perhaps ex-
pected him to play presently he will ring
and the stenographer will jot down a few
rapid remarks before taking away the blue-
print and attachments but not the sand-
wich however to which the chief clings lov-
ingly throughout the bustle he does not
part with it for a reason as it may now be
 pm and it probably represents all he has
found time to eat since breakfast

   there goes the boss out for another jun-
ket with his car is an absurd statement one
often hears if any idea of a junket is or
has been entertained dismiss it now cham-
pagne corks do not pop in official private
cars nor in the knock-about borrowed tem-
porarily by the roadmasters committee while
deciding which section - foreman is entitled

to the annual prize nor even in the much
more exclusive one which houses the presi-
dent when on his travels

  the railroad is more worthy than the law
of the title of jealous mistress and it brooks
no rival officials understand this and they
would not be officials if they had not well
digested its truth

an office on wheels

  you will note that the car during its lim-
ited stay at a terminal transacts a tremen-
dous amount of business possibly it has
not been side-tracked at this particular point
fortwo or three months and it becomes at
once the center of interest at least from a
motive-power standpoint

  there are always minor officials of more
or less importance constantly riding over the
road in the interests of that department in-
spectors of locomotives machinery and cars
indicator experts and calculators of tonnage
rating all of whom report to the superin-
tendent of motive-power by letter and only
when he is on the line have an opportunity
to meet him face to face

  they naturally have an accumulation of
business to unload sufficient to stagger any
but a thoroughly trained mind and a brain
accustomed to making quick decisions to
avoid delaying a costly game

  along these lines an incident may be re-
called to illustrate the general versatility of
the men who hold down the strenuous job of
head of the motive-power organization it
was on an occasion when the car used by
the general mechanical superintendent of the
erie railroad stopped at port jervis new
york while westward bound on a general
inspection

  for two weeks previous to its arrival sev-
eral experts in their line had been conduct-
ing an elaborate series of locomotive tonnage
tests on the new erie and jersey extension
and with much complaisance called to make
a report

  the results of the test properly tabulated
with grade resistance curve resistance roll-
ing resistance and all associated features of
moment were spread before the chief for ap-
proval but in less than an hour with a lead-
pencil and his own calculations on the back
of an envelope he had literally shot the rec-
ord full of holes

  he pointed convincingly to an error here
and a graver one there to the omission of
essential detail and to the unnecessary ad-
dition of undue complexity until the experts


the railroad mans magazine

retired very much chagrined and ran the test
over again

  this little by-play proved singularly ap-
pealing to the writer because he knew that
the men on the test had but that one assign-
ment to harass them while the general me-
chanical superintendent had on his mind at
that time no less than one hundred items of
widely varying scope

  for him to thoroughly revise their calcula-
tions on a moments notice could not but
compel admiration for the sterling qualifi-
cations which made such a feat possible

grasping the details

  a e mitchell now retiring from railroad
work when superintendent of motive-power
on the lehigh valley was equally resource-
ful especially when anything like a show-
down was in order he was probably more
proficient in the ready employment of for-
mulas to score his point than any man the
business ever knew he once had some en-
gines of a certain class which were claimed
by their runners to be slippery in a con-
dition where nobody could hold them down
and were quoted as  slipping out of a sand-
house until the division where they run be-
came much agitated

  the master mechanic in that territory ad-
vanced the theory that the steam pressure
should be cut down to lessen the tractive ef-
fort and came to the car on the occasion of
one of its visits with his road foreman of
engines to present this contention

  it didnt take mitchell long however
after asking a few pertinent questions to
effectually dissipate this hypothesis he
proved to their satisfaction through a few
simple figures that the steam pressure did
not need to be changed as the tractive effort
was at present less than the adhesion on any
one pair of driving-wheels and consequent-
ly the engine could not slip from overpres-
sure

  this demonstration was in turn conveyed
by the road foreman to the engineers and
presently everybody forgot all about the slip-
pery motive-power

receiving reports

  the road foreman of engines is always a
visitor to the car when it is in his territory
and the superintendent of motive-power is
glad to see him he is essentially the best-
posted man on the division regarding loco-
motive performance as he is charged with

riding on the engines all the time and is fully
competent to discuss the all-important mat-
ters of fuel and oil consumption

  it might be added that he will be sharply
criticized if he fails to make at least an
average good showing in these two items the
criticism being based upon the tabulated
statement prepared monthly which portrays
the economics of the entire system

  the master mechanic must necessarily pay
his respects recognition of authority de-
mands this if nothing else but even if he
should not call any idea that the superin-
tendent of motive-power will fail to take ad-
vantage of the opportunity to visit him had
best be abandoned because this is really the
purpor for which the car was side-tracked
at the division terminal

  the master mechanic had better improve
the hour or so of friendly notice which he
may have had from the train-despatcher that
the car was coming to get his shops and en-
gines in apple-pie order as they will be in
for a relentless scrutiny from one who knows
where to look for trouble

finding the flaws

  notwithstanding the reports which pass
without intermission daily weekly and
monthly from the office of the master me-
chanic to that of the superintendent of rno-
tive-power and in which the details em-
bodied might be assumed to fully portray the
conduct of the division there is still much
which they do not picture

  they omit mention of broken window-
panes roundhouse pits flooded with water
machines standing idle material misapplied
jacks in serried ranks out of business for
lack of a little tinkering and many many
other features incompatible with things as
they ought to be hence the necessity for an
analysis of the local situation from a per-
sonal view-point

  at times a thin-skinned master mechanic
will become aggrieved at the criticism leveled
at his plant and its modus operandi while
accompanying the superintendent of motive-
power on one of these inspections and very
often it does seem somewhat unkind and ill-
advised

  the master mechanic may not take a suffi-
ciently broad view of the matter to appreciate
that these things are only skin-deep after
all and that his superior can have no other
logical motive than to help him out

  it must stand to reason that when an offi-
cial clothed with so much authority makes a
the superintendent of motive power



length visit to a large general shop and
departs without finding any fault he either
intends to make a change in its head has no
interest in the heads success or doesnt know
enough about the business himself to criti-
cize

  as the latter is an extremely unlikely con-
tingency the master mechanic should really
feel better that he is thus criticized because
lie can depend upon it that when a super-
intendent is finding a little fault he is sim-
ply picking specks off a good apple and if
lie thought the apple was spoiled he wouldnt
lake the trouble to bother with it

where seeing means saving

  probably the most painstaking inspection
trips ever made were those of f n hibbits
formerly mechanical superintendent of the
new york new haven and hartford rail-
road that he was a master of detail may
partially explain the diligent effort which he
always made to delve to the bottom of every
department represented from office to turn-
table

  amazing as the statement may appear he
could glance into a single bin in a large store-
house and say positively whether or not it
contained more stuff than on the occasion
of his last visit maybe six weeks before
with this remarkable memory was associated
an equally remarkable acuteness as many
will attest who ever tried to hide anything
from him on short notice

  whether or not some of his rulings de-
livered on the ground were exasperating from
a strictly local view-point we were still al-
ways glad to see him come around the place

  we knew that he was honest in his mo-
tives and convictions inspired only by a
sincere enthusiasm for the general good of
his department he attacked the problem
of motive-power administration with much
effectiveness by maintaining an unceasing
vigil over leakages whether represented on
the pay-roll or the stock account

  the results were always substantial as
under his regime a single division of the
road cut down its pay-roll  in one
year and reduced its stock balance from
 to  in the same period the
service remaining unimpaired through the re-
trenchments

  hibbits realized that good stock not to
mention obsolete stock represented money
tied up without interest and in curtailing
this to a working basis was simply anticipa-
ting what is a requisite now on the harri-

man lines for every man in a supervising
capacity who wants to hold his job

  still other matters vital to the general
efficiency of the division if not to the system
as a whole remain to be considered before the
superintendents car can be attached to the
train for further movement one of these a
persona duty is to quietly sound the labor
situation to know that the master mechanic
and his foremen in that territory are living
up to the letter of the agreements between the
various trades and the company

  it is an unwritten duty of a mechanical
superintendent to keep the peace not only be-
tween the organizations and the company
but between the foremen themselves and die
master mechanic lack of harmony has shat-
tered many a perfect organization and the
superintendent of motive-power must restore
it at the expense of a house-cleaning even at
the expense of men whom he may have made
with a full realization of all this the super-
intendent cannot leave one division for the
next with his mind at ease until assured that
not the suspicion of a cloud rests on the hori-
zon

  so much for the visit to a single point on
the system multiply this by ten remaining
divisions add innumerable letters dictated
and weighty conferences while the car is in
transit divide by eight as the days covered
by the inspection and you will agree that
each day has its full quota of business

monthly routine

  when the monthly trip is over the mechan-
ical superintendent takes up the remaining
three weeks of good hard work in his more or
less imposing office at headquarters he al-
ways endeavors to be at home the greater part
of the month as this permits opportunity
for frequent conference with his superior the
general manager as well as those of his im-
mediate staff the master car-builder mechan-
ical engineer and engineer of tests

  in some places the office apportionment
permits these important officials to be under
the same roof with their chief although he
is just as frequently far removed and busi-
ness intercourse necessarily carried on
through correspondence

  in order that he may be fully advised how
his subordinates the master mechanics are
conducting their various divisions the ma-
jority of railroads employ a system of re-
porting by forms there is a daily tele-
graphic report for the engines held in any
one roundhouse every twenty-four hours
 v

the railroad mans magazine

tlius illustrating at a glance the amount of
available power on that division there is
also a similar report by wire of engine fail-
ures enumerating every instance during the
same period where a train has failed to
make its schedule time arising from im-
proper condition of the power and still an-
other message report from each division
stating whether or not the monthly appro-
priation for a single day has been exceeded

telegraphic reports

  these various reports are compiled by the
clerks on a large sheet for ready reference
which represents the entire system the
items are to the left with parallel vertical
columns representing the divisions thus af-
fording the chief a graphic picture of these
important details in the day just past

  it depends on his personal caliber just
what action will be taken should he notice
that the a division with a daily appropria-
tion of  has reported an expenditure of
 he will likely wire the master mechanic
sharply to the effect that if he keeps this up
he cannot possibly remain within the month-
ly allotment for his territory

  if on the b division five engine failures
loom on the sheet where heretofore one has
been the daily average the chief thereof may
be reminded that the bottom appears to be
dropping out and asked to kindly advise
what particular phase of the local situation
cannot be controlled

  this daily summary of telegraphic reports
is the real pulse of the motive-power per-
formance and every item thereon implying a
retrogression from some standard scale of
efficiency brings a reminder to the man in
charge and for the moral effect if nothing
else it must go forth that day thus action
is different than in the case of the many
monthly reports as these imply broad results
and may be more leisurely digested

engine economies

  in connection with these latter statements
that indicating the consumption of oil per di-
vision is considered of special importance
-most locomotives are expected to run one
thousand miles at a total cost of  for all
lubricant and illuminating oils including
valve or cylinder engine oil and headlight
oil

  in fact there are oil-producing companies
who guarantee to lubricate an engine for that
very amount it is therefore necessary to

draw up an oil schedule covering each run
on every division and to apportion the al-
lowance per engine generally on the basis
of one pint of valve and three pints of en-
gine oil per hundred miles so that the total
will not be exceeded

  it might be that the a division during
july august and september lubricated for
 and in october jumped to  this
is a direct increase of forty cents per thousand
miles shown on the report mentioned and
inquiry is in order to learn the cause

  the deadly comparative basis prevails in
connection with the oil performance report
as indeed in the instance of all the others
and there can be no evasion in the explana-
tion

  there may of course be a legitimate rea-
son for the rise in cost new engines breaking
in and requiring extra oil extra long hours
on the road and many others which would
be valid but whether valid reasons or sim-
ply excuses the explanation must be forth-
coming the idea is to prevent lapse into
carelessness

  through all the monthly reports the same
idea predominates the embarrassing duty
of having to explain a worse performance
than some one else serves to keep the master 
mechanic on the job all the time

 filling new wants

  there is another report showing the num-
ber of overhauled engines turned out of the
various back shops for the month but par-
ticularly the cost of the repairs which they
received if the cost is higher on the a di-
vision than that shown by the b c and d
divisions for similar work something is
wrong-at all events a condition is present
on the former division requiring correction

  it is through these and other statements
that the superintendent of motive-power may
absorb fairly accurate information regarding
the efficiency of the various divisions under
his jurisdiction and after a year or so can
say conclusively which master mechanic is de-
livering the goods or vice versa

  they exemplify the wonderful system pre-
vailing in railroad organization in which
no matter how much familiarity may be at-
tained there is always something new and
something to admire every day

  the matter of forms may seem overdone at
times even absurdly so but the idea is that
only results count results compared with
those achieved somewhere else under equal
conditions
the superintendent of motive power



  independent of his routine work which
heretofore has been commented on the su-
perintendent of motive - power must be an
originator he is paid  a year not
for scanning a multiplicity of forms and ma-
king trips over the road unpleasant as the
latter may be but for thinking all the time
how to improve his department and particu-
larly to reduce general costs through labor-
saving operations in the shops

  if he cannot show increased efficiency and
reduced expenses over the administration of
his predecessor he is labeled a failure and
the general manager will be likely to very
shortly let him know it

  in view of all the duties mentioned in this
article which pertain to the position it might
be thought that little time would lie left for
original research but some superintendents
have managed to find it

  f w johnstone made a sterling record on
the old mexican central in the face of two
handicaps - no money to spend and any
amount of interference

  while organizing his department on a
commbn-serse basis he still found time to
develop for railroad service the native labor
of mexico so that dependence would not
have to be placed on the elusive floating ele-
ment from other countries he worked out
and patented a blow-off cock of his own far
superior to anything else in use in that bad
water country and a compound engine of his
design was the only thing which would han-
dle a train over rascon mountain in those
days

men who succeeded

  a j cromwell of the baltimore and
ohio was the successor of the truly great
men ross winans thatcher perkins and
john c davis whose genius left its reflec-
tion in every car and engine which the b
and o owned when he became elevated to
the position yet he designed and built in
the mt clare shops the most efficient power
for its inches ever operated by that or any
other railroad

  if you ask them there to-day they will tell
you what they think of the cromwell eight-
hundreds in their time and may point to
some of them running yet

  h	d taylor of the reading railway de-
signed and built last year in this age of
competition a three-cylinder locomotive of
entirely new design which is giving wonder-
ful results at present in service on the new
york division of that road and he planned
and brought into being the great reading

shops which in perfection of detail are
probably the best appointed in the country

  t rumney assumed charge of motive-
power affairs on the erie when to say the
least they were in a bewildering condition
the managefnent of that department had
changed so often that fifty sets of ideas were
exemplified in the design of merely minor
locomotive parts and a dozen methods of
doing the same job could be observed in a
trip over the road

  the contrast afforded after three or four
years well-directed effort is startling sound
and economical ideas now prevail in every
shop from jersey city to chicago sensible
labor-saving devices have been introduced
and circulated over the system by special
men for the benefit of all master mechanics
a single casting serves where formerly a
dozen had to be carried in stock standard
shop practise-cards are in vogue and rigidly
adhered to and the general efficiency of the
power based merely on comparison of the
engine failure reports during the period has
increased over one hundred per cent

the advantage of prosperity

  the ease with which the work is done
broadly speaking depends largely upon the
prosperity of the railroad and on whether
the general motive-power appropriation is
sufficient for the adequate maintenance of the
shops and rolling-stock to provide personal
help for special investigations and to de-
velop new ideas

  the pennsylvania system represents this
enviable condition it is characterized by a
broad liberal policy on the part of the man-
agement which finds its reflection in the
amount of money allowed each department

  in consequence its mechanical department
has always-been identified with originality
and research under the direction of its
chief of motive-power  has been ex-
pended in one year for research work alone
for the possible betterment of existing ap-
pliances

  on a prosperous railroad the superintend-
ent of motive-power will have on his per-
sonal staff a master car-builder at  to
 a year charged with the administra-
tion of the car repair department a mechan-
ical engineer at  to  under
whom is the drawing-room and an engineer
of tests at s to  to test and
analyze all crude material purchased for the
mechanical department and to whom the va-
rious inspectors make their reports


the railroad mans magazine

  this is the usual organization but if the
road is richly endowed the mechanical su-
perintendent can still surround himself
through the mechanical engineers office with
technical men which training he may not
have had opportunity to acquire provided he
came up in the usual manner traced in this
series of articles as the evolution of the ap-
prentice then if an inspiration should
come to him regarding a new type of engine
or car to meet the growing requirements of
his road a rough sketch and pencil-notes will
suffice as the groundwork from which they
will work out the details

  he may even be so fortunate in the way of
money to spend as to have attached to his of-
fice a thoroughly practical and shrewd me-
chanic possibly an ex-foreman or master
mechanic of varied experience and he can
use this man to much advantage sometimes
frames commence to break mysteriously un-
der engines or an epidemic of hot boxes may
crop up on some division which means an
assignment for this practical assistant

  they might break and run hot for six
months before the facts were arrived at
through the medium of correspondence but
he will repair to the scene and investigate
the conditions without fear or favor and in
many cases nip the trouble in the bud

  this position known as general inspector
is fast becoming recognized as an indispen-
sable adjunct to the superintendent

  the poor railroad cannot do these things
in fact to make both ends meet it must re-

strict the general supervision in the motive-
power department to the master car-buildc-r
and the mechanical superintendent some
of them even cannot offer a mechanical en-
gineer to say the least of a test department
and the work under such conditions is har-
assing in the extreme

  whether with money to spend or without
it the duties of the position are exacting but
what has been said of the subordinate grades
in their turn there is no position connected
with the motive-power department not syn-
onymous with hard work and unceasing vigi-
lance

  they have few emoluments to serve as a
counterbalance to the grief of possession but
it is nevertheless great for a superintendent
of motive-power to feel in his heart that he
has risen to the height of things and to many
temperaments this is an adequate reward

  it is not the appeal of the dollar although
its coming has been long delayed but the
feeling which prompts a man to view with a
swelling heart the fact that he is master of a
thousand locomotives fifty shops and twenty
thousand men the custodian of a trust
wherein the slightest deviation from the rig-
idly defined way might result in chaos

  it is great to know that those who have
been so honored with the appointment must
feel the unswerving confidence which will
permit the trust and there are few of these
men who for any consideration would part
with the elation which the position cannot
fail to inspire

a plea for the pilot

the pilot known in the vernacular as the  cow-
catcher which ornaments the front end of
american railroad locomotives has always been a
subject for ridicule by foreign railway men per-
haps it has been partially responsible for keeping
alive the tradition that the united states is still a
jungle filled with wild animals and indians

  that the pilot is a valuable safety attachment to
a locomotive even on the highest class american
railways where cows pigs and other stray live stock
are not permitted to promenade will be agreed to
by all american railway officers

  in fact from two recent news items in the ger-
man technical press we judge that european build-
ers of locomotives for export might copy american
railway practice in the matter of pilots with ad-
vantages to their customers

  the first of these items records two recent col-
lisions of trains with  wild elephapts  on the
siam railway near bangkok in both cases it
seems the elephants were killed although one of

the animals was large size of the other not
stated but the large elephant was ponderous
enough to derail the train although it was double-
headed and had twenty-seven cars tipping over
both locomotives and telescoping six cars

  these locomotives surely ought to be protected
by  cowcatchers  designed for an elephantine roll-
ing load as fences and cattle-guards cannot keep
elephants off the line

  the other item is the news that some heavy loco-
motives which a german firm is building for the
damascus-mecca railway are to be provided with
cowcatchers not large ones but sufficient to
butt a stubborn camel calf off the track

  so it seems that in this case the wild-animal con- 
ditions have been duly taken care of if siam will
now make the necessary addition to its engines so
that america siam and the arabian desert will
class together we may regard the cowcatcher to
be fairly standardized for all railways which trav-

under the engine

    by f h richardson

bill didnt go to the beanery as usual and
something out of the ordinary happened

but i heard all about it from the head brake-
man old lawton and dick his fireman

  it was this way when they pulled on-
to hillsdale lawton was mad enough to bite
a chunk out of the boiled-head dick was
nursing a big fat grouch himself and the
head brakeman had deserted the ship en-
tirely

   he was riding back in an empty box
car cussin everything in sight and put-
ting in most of his time chasing himself
from one end of the car to the other to keep
from freezing to death

   theyd had an awful time of it all that
day there had been cars to set out and
others to pick up at ever tank and you
know how them cranky station-agents is
wanting every car set exactly at the cattle-
chute or the freight-liouse door

  why when i was firing for old bill
hawkens one of them trouble hunters actu-
ally made us uncouple from the train after
we was all through and go back into the
siding to move a box car just six inches



                      is this i hear
iut old jack law-
s fireman getting
ght under the en-
e and nearly killed
bill inquired the
eagle eye as he put the finishing touches to
 new-fangled spring seat-box cushion he
had purchased he was fastening it into
placj as the engine stood in the roundhouse
i heard it was a pretty close call

  close call you bet your steam-gage it
was it was so close you couldnt have
shoved a piece of tissue paper between dick
sommers an his little six feet of earth to
have saved your soul

    it was so close that the old feller with
the scythe shook hands with him half a doz-
en times in ten minutes

  how did it happen bill asked the
eagle eye as he seated himself comfortably
on the new cushion and cocked his feet up
on the throttle-lever

   well of course i wasnt there myself


the railroad mans magazine

i

   gee how i did love that man i could
a sawed his head off

  well as i was saying they was having
troubles of their own the coal was about
half snow and of course the old tub lawton
runs wasnt steaming any too well

  they certainly were having a merry time
of it remarked the eagle eye

  yes cheer up sonny the worst is
just coming in sight around the curve the
left-hand injector had gone on a strike early
in the game and about an hour before we
got to hillsdale the other one got something
wrong with its chronometer balance and
cylinder escapement

   it performed its duty of pumping water
into the boiler all right but it made a noise
like an able-bodied buzz-saw of course
the prospect of having to set beside the thing
all the rest of the trip made old lawton
feel real happy and good-natured

   he told me he felt so peaceful and con-
tented when he pulled into hillsdale that he
would have actually enjoyed running the en-
gine and train off the end of a bridge

   the head brakeman had gone back to
hibernate in a box car he said it was two
and a half degrees colder there than at the
north pole but he preferred freezing to
having his hearing put eternally and ever-
lastingly on the fritz by a cussed brass squirt
gone crazy

   there is a beanery at hillsdale and
dick had been in the habit of polishing his
teeth on some of the viands while lawton
was oiling round sometimes it would hap-
pen he would get hold of an extra tough
piece of pie and couldnt get it broke up
into pieces small enough to go down his neck
before the train pulled out when that hap-
pened he would jump a car back in the train
and walk ahead to the engine over the top

    as soon as they stopped at hillsdale that
day dick climbed clown intending to go
over and have a free-for-all with a ham
sandwich but he took a squint into the ash-
pan first and found it chock-full of course
that meant clean it then and there

  he got the ash-hoe from the hooks at
the side of the tank and crawled under her
to do the job

   the engine he fires is
one of them old eight-wheel-
ers that aint got no trap-
door in the bottom of their
pans so he had to crawl
clear under her on his knees

   some snow had blowed
into the pan partly melted
and froze again so that
dick had troubles of his
own getting the ashes out

   he bumped an elbow
on one of the links and of
course that helped to im-
prove his temper wonder-
fully

    but for all his trouble
he got the job done finally
and was just about to pull
out the hoe when the en-
gine moved ahead with a
jerk and the drivers spun
around throwing a shower
of sparks over him 
you can bet your next
months pay against a
cracked water-glass that
dick set up and took notice
real sudden 

   how did lawton come
to move the engine with the
fireman under her asked
the engineer
uner the engine

  say you just keep your shirt on till i
get to that part

   old lawton had always made it a prac-
tise to oil at hillsdale but this trip he put
in the time monkeying with the injector
the time was squandered for he wasnt a
bit wiser when he got through than when he
started that squirt just put its throttle to
its branch-pipe wiggled its lever at him and
went right on working overtime

  youd pretty near had to have an ear-
trumpet to hear a gatling gun in that cab

  he had just got done when the con come
up with the orders and give the signal to
pull out so he slammed the lever down in
the corner give the throttle a jerk that set
the drivers spinning and put on the injector
almost at the same instant

   of course dick wasnt there being real
busy doing some stunts down under the en-
gine so lawton had to get down and put in
a fire

   by the time hed finished that the en-
gine was past the lunch-room door or he
might have rubbered in and observed that
dick was not there

  you dont mean to say that he pulled
out-left the station-with the fireman un-
der the engine

   oh no replied billj with fine sarcasm
of course not dick was on top of the
smoke-stack wiping the dust off the smoke

  well dick was doing some mighty in-
teresting stunts down under that old mill
about that time when she first started he
supposed lawton was moving her ahead a
little to get at her wedges and driving-boxes
to oil em but when she quit slipping and

dick had been in the habit of polishing

his teeth on some of the viands

the old man in the cab gave her steam again
dick changed his mind

   he thought that some one that didnt
belong there had got into the cab and had
started her by accident but giving her
steam again when she stopped slipping
didnt gibe with that theory his next guess
was that lawton had gone batty-clean off
his base that injector was sure enough to
drive any one to the dippy hut thinks he
g

the railroad mans magazine

  meanwhile he was letting out yells that
would v done credit to an indian on the
war-path but that was a waste of good at-
mosphere for with that injector going the
battle of bunker hill could a been pulled
off under the engine without being heard in
the cab

   about the time she got going as fast as
dick could walk stooped over as he was it
popped into his head that he had not told
lawton he was going to clean the pan and

 it certainly was an ash-hoe

what was more there hadnt been any oiling
round done-so the engineer had not seen
him under the engine

  suffering cattle - guards  thinks dick
to himself  the old man dont know a thing
about me being down here and ill bet a
chunk of coal against a wad of molasses
hes pulling out 

  ltp in the cab lawton finished putting
in a fire and rubbered back at the train
but there was no dick in sight

   he climbed up on the seat-box and
leaned out of the cab window to get away
from some of the uproar the injector was
manufacturing the engine was beginning
to move along right spry and her exhaust
was making some noise itself for she was
wide open and lawton was too mad to hook
her up much

  for all the racket it sorter seemed like
he heard a shout or rather scream coming
from-he couldnt tell where

  there wasnt a soul
in sight so he set it down
to imagination and after
squinting around got
down to put in another
fire wondering where in
sam hill dick could be

   the fire in he
climbed up on the tank
and took a squint back
over die train - narj a
fireman was in sight
 dicks got left  was the
first thing that popped
into his mind

     now i suppose ill
have to fire this infernal
tub all the way in and
he growled looking at
dicks empty seat-box
like hed enjoy kicking
the thing out of the win-
dow

  while all this was
coming off up in the cab
dick was stumbling
along in the snow spend-
ing his time between try-
ing to keep on his feet
and cussing

   he stopped yelling
he knew it was no use
trying to compete with
the injector when it came
to making a noise

   as soon as he was
sure they were really
leaving the station he knew that running
wouldnt do he was just ahead o the
front drivingaxle with the eccentric blades
bobbing up and down on both sides and the
links just in front

   everything around him was moving
more or less fast and would soon be moving
faster ahead the saddle came down so
low that he didnt try to dodge under it to
reach the front truck where he could have
managed to ride fairly well
under the engine	

  the engine kept traveling faster and
faster until one of dicks feet slipped on a
snow-covered tie and down he went expect-
ing to be-well you know what hed look
like after the engine and twenty or thirty
car got through with him

   as he fell he made a grab at things in
general and nothing in particular and one
of his hands closed on an electric-blade

  the thing was heaving up and down of
course and likewise it was cold but dick
hung on like grim death to let go meant
grim death for him and well he knew it

   he was dragging right under the driving
axle and reaching up he got his other arm
over it from behind it was smooth and
greasy and as the motion was pulling his
arm to it it served as a support almost as
well as if it had been standing still instead
of revolving

   next he let go of the blade and grabbed
the top edge of a driving-box he says he
dont just know what he did do then but
the next he remembers he was standing on
top of the front damper his back pressed
against the jacket of the boiler and his hands
resting on the frame on each side

  but bill there is not enough room for
a man to get in between the driving axle and
the fire-box as you describe remarked the
engineer

  huh you just go look at that engine
shes one of the old tubs with a short fire-
box and theres plenty of room its wonder-
ful what some of you  high brows  know

  the snow was beginning to be drawn up
by suction and it beat in his face till he was
almost blinded the raw iron and snow was
making his hands numb too and just to
help things along and make it nice and
homelike the damper teetered up and down
like it would give way any second and dump
him off on the ties that was slipping under
him like a streak

   below he could see the handle of the
ash-hoe sticking out of the pan on both
sides just over the drivers was a small open-
ing and dick figured that if he could only
draw the hoe from the pan he might be able
to shove it out on the engineers side where
lawton would be certain to see it and be
moved to investigate

   he rubbered at the hoe as well as he
could for the snow wondering if he could
reach it

  well thinks he if i fall itll be a
case of private funeral and no flowers but
itll be the same thing a few minutes later
anyhow for i sure cant roost up here much
longer so here goes 

   up in the cab lawton was dividing his
time between running the engine firing and
cussing the injector

   that fixed him up so that he felt right
chipper and he climbed up on the seat-box
and stuck his head out of the window only
to jerk it in again as though it was fastened
to a rubber band

  there sticking out over the drivers and
waving around in the air was an ash-hoe

  there was no doubt- about it it cer-
tainly was an ash-hoe

    what the -  he yelled  great

horned toad-the fireman 

   once he caught the idea lawton wasnt
long getting a move on him he swung the
air to emergency and climbed out of the
front window onto the running board kneel-
ing down and leaning out he could look un-
der the engine and pretty soon he made out
dicks form through the haze of snow he
yelled to dick to hold on for just a minute
longer and climbed back into the cab and
whistled the flagman back

   the brake-shoes hadnt hardly got done
squealing before he was down on the ground
just as she came to a stop dick tumbled to
the ties in a heap unhurt-but happy

 oh narrower grows the pass-

 the air is damp and chill

 oh whence comes that surging mass
 that causes the stream to fill

                   but hark to the sound that i hear
                   the thundering sound that is pealed

                  it comes from afar and yet near

                   for soon is the wonder revealed

 and narrower grows the path

 more noisy the waters sweep

 with fury and foaming wrath

 they make their desperate leap

                  tis naught but a slender ledge

                    that borders the rushing tide

                    and the road seems just like a pledge
                    to stay by the rivers side

 the narrowing road leads straight

 and the waters keep up their chant

 ever louder the dashing freight
 continues to mumble and pant

                   till the path and stream form a wedge
                   twixt walls of gigantic size

                  and plunging within this hedge

                   the waters continue their cries

 and the plunging crashing freight

 vistaed between the rocks

 seems like an added weight
 to the guarding sentinel locks

                   and the waters continue their play

                    are they seeking their liberty

or is the freedom a fray

                    as theyre forced to the far-off sea

 and down they splash and they dash

 they churn and they foam and spray

 they drop like a gleaming flash

 and unfettered pursue their way
to transit improvements in the
city of new york-

by e l bacon

efficient transportation facilities for new york city whose subways
and street railroads last year alone carried as many passengers as there
are people in the world have long been the despair of railroad presidents
and boards of directors of the lines which terminate in manhattan even when
engineers came forward to solve the difficulty the enormous expense entailed
made them hold back until the pressure of rapidly increasing traffic left no other
course open now that the purse-strings have finally been loosened there seems
to be no limit to the golden flood that is pouring forth

     bigger and better is the watchword and of the billions of dollars to be spent
for transit improvements a large part has already been consumed it is a sum
of money almost too great for the comprehension of the average human being
and yet the rate at which present traffic conditions are growing points to the
fact that it will probably have to be duplicated within a generation

the gigantic sums that will be paid out in the near future by the
municipality of the american metropolis for street-railway
improvements almost dazzle comprehension

set the world to marveling over the wonders
of modern enterprise and ingenuity

  now that the job is finished what do
you expect to do next   inquired george
carey one of die older engineers of bill
ferguson a younger member of his pro-
fession who had been working with him in
the tubes for eight strenuous years

get a harder one replied ferguson
carey rubbed his grizzled beard for a mo-
ment and smiled sadly life was a man who
had been through many a big feat of engi-
neering

  young man he said you wont find
any harder job than this in your generation
the biggest thing has been done all this
work that is going  now of rebuilding
new york as a traffic center beats anything
the world has ever dreamed of and anything
of the kind that will be seen in my lifetime
or in yours

   these are the times that you will look

         strange cosmopolitan army
            of workers such as had never

            corners of the earth when the
            pennsylvanias tunnels con-
            necting new jersey manhattan and long
            island were completed

 up from the wonderful subterranean
highways of commerce they had built blink-

back to and will talk about when you are
old youve got a breathing space now to
stop and realize how much in our line is
going on in this city and when youve done
so youll agree with me

  any one else who stops to realize the
same thing will agree probably that the old
engineer was right other great terminal
improvements will be planned and built but
it is hard to believe that this genera-
tion of workers will again be engaged
in such a colossal scheme of traffic con-
struction as is to be completed within the
next five years-the rehabilitation of new
yorks transit service the first and greatest
chapter of which the extension of the penn-
sylvanias roads into manhattan island is
now drawing to a close

where the money goes

  big figures are not as impressive in these
days as formerly when one is confronted
by them on every hand they lose their sig-
nificance the publics sense of proportion
becomes warped instead of showing imme-
diate astonishment one has to stop to con-
sider whether the expenditure of a few
millions means very much after all in
comparison with other big things that are
being done

  but we havent begun to talk about bil-
lions yet there being no billionaires no
billion-dollar buildings no billion-dollar con-
struction works of any kind and the spend-
ing of even half a billion is enough to make
the world open its eyes and take notice

  that is what the remaking of new york
as a traffic center is going to cost-a half
billion dollars perhaps it will even cost
another hundred millions this is the price
of solving the knottiest traffic problem that
has ever been presented or probably that
ever will be within the lifetime of any one
that lives to-day

  it is the penalty of having established the
metropolis of the western world upon a long
and narrow little island banded by broad
and deep rivers

  just a few figures they will give a
more detailed idea of what a huge piece of
work this rehabilitation of the new york
traffic center is

  bringing the pennsylvania railroad into
manhattan island and linking it with long
island and new england 

  reconstructing the new york central
railroads terminal on manhattan island


  city subways now being constructed or
already decided upon by the public service
commission 

  piers which the present city administra-
tion expects to build 

  these figures make a total of -


  they do not tell the whole story an-
other item is the extension of the hudson
and manhattan railroad companys tunnel
the additional line to run from thirty-third
street and sixth avenue under sixth av-
enue to fortieth street and under bryant
park to forty-second street and the grand
central station

  but there is still another huge improve-
ment yet to be mentioned-the building of a
harbor in jamaica bay and the cutting of
a canal connection from there to flushing
bay if this project should be carried out
it would bring the total much nearer to
 than to half a billion

  just how much it would cost nobody
knows the estimates run as high as -
 perhaps the project will never be
carried out but the city has already agreed
to spend  for preliminary work in
case the national government appropriates
 for the same purpose

a presidents problem

  there is a pathetic chapter in the story
of the remaking of americas greatest ter-
minal point a commanding figure in the
railroad world a few years ago-perhaps the
most commanding at that time-was a j
cassatt president of the pennsylvania rail-
road he was a commanding figure phys-
ically as well as by reason of his ability-a
giant of a man more than six feet two
inches in height broad of shoulder straight
as a soldier

  it was in the brain of this man who saw
farther into the future than most that the
first great step in the work now under way
of making the worlds most marvelous traf-
fic terminal was conceived it was his bold
plan that stirred his roads great rival the
new york central into mapping out its own
huge terminal improvement

the solution

  he found the way quickly there began
to develop the whole tremendous plan to
the directors of this company he presented in
confirmation of his judgment a table of
population statistics a map of new york
transit improvements in the city of new york 

city and adjacent territory and a brief com-
putation of figures

  he took a compass and fixed the radius
to a distance that would scale nineteen miles
he placed the pin of the compass at thirty-
third street and seventh avenue new
york and swept its arm in a circle

  he showed that within this area there
would be by normal growth six million per-
sons in the year  and eight millions
in  he asked the directors if they ex-
pected to continue to depend upon ferry-
boats to pierce die center of this great hu-
man hive

  his plan extended even farther than get-
ting into manhattan island he looked for-
ward not only to tunneling the hudson but
to getting possession of the long island
railroad and of tunneling a connection to
it under manhattan island and the east
river his eyes were upon new england
and the long island road could be used
as a link toward getting into the rich terri-
tory of which the new haven system had a
practical monopoly

  in  the pennsylvania gobbled up the
long island and a part of his plan was
realized

the finished product

  then the breath of scandal swept over
dozens of big corporations-the pennsyl-
vania railroad among them cassatt
wounded by harsh criticism died of a bro-
ken heart his genius overlooked and unap-
preciated

  odier men rushed his plans to completion
and to-day they have been carried out to the
letter at thirty-third street and seventh
avenue new york a terminal station cov-
ering twenty-eight acres one of die archi-
tectural wonders of the world on which the
finishing touches are now being put stands
as a monument to his genius

  from bergen hill in new jersey to this
station and there on under manhattan
island and the east river to long island
stretch tunnels big enough for the roads
through vestibuled trains in the river tubes
are six and eight-tenths miles of single track
and in the land tubes tracks of just the same
length at the manhattan station there will
be an initial service of  trains a day on
the pennsylvania and  trains a day on
the long island all coming and going un-
der die two broad rivers

  one of die most interesting parts of the
whole scheme the new york connecting

railroad will cost  this road
will link the pennsylvania and long island
systems to die railroads of new england it
will be built upon a bridge from long island
city by way of wards and randalls islands
to port morris a station on the new haven
road from long island city the road will
run to bay ridge from which freight will be
floated across the bay to the freight terminal
at greenville new jersey

underground travel

  the new grand central station is to be the
center of a network of travel routes already
the original subway is one of its arteries as
well as the third avenue elevated and sev-
eral surface lines soon there will be two
new subways tapping it

  the hudson and manhattan tube under
the hudson is to be extended to it from its
present thirty-third street terminal then
the proposed broadway and lexington ave-
nue tunnel will reach it on the lexington
avenue side before long the unused stein-
way tube under die east river at forty-sec-
ond street will probably be put into service
and will be still another of die grand cen-
trals arteries

  the problem of getting the people through
the crowded city is as great as the one the
steam railroads have faced of getting them in
and out there is not another city in the
world that presents anything like as serious
a problem not only because of new yorks
size and rapid growth but because of its
peculiar geographical characteristics

  a glance at some of the amazing transpor-
tation figures gives an idea of the hugeness of
the task of providing adequate transit facili-
ties li  the subway and street railroads
of the city carried over -al-
most as great as the population of the earth

  in that year diev carried  more
passengers than in  and die bulk of diis
increase was on routes where there was no
increase of facilities

the growth of traffic

to cam- this great multitude there are

 miles of single track  passenger-
cars and the cost of operating these lines in
 was over  during that
year the cars ran more than 
miles which would be equal to more than 
round-trips between the earth and the moon

  how fast the problem grows is strikingly
set forth by some figures from the subway


the railroad mans magazine

the subway was designed to carry 
passengers a day during the first two months
of its operation it carried  passengers a
day that was almost six years ago in
 it was carrying  people daily-
just double the number it was designed to
carry

  if no important additions were made to the
citys transit service within the next ten
years it would be impossible to handle the
rush-hour crowds by the year 

  but the city will not have to wait ten years
for relief while there are now less than
thirty-two miles of tunnel routes there will
be almost ninety miles more in operation
within five years without counting the
through railroad tubes of the pennsylvania
and die new york central

  foremost in the new subway system that is
about to be begun will be the broadway and
lexington avenue lines this route will
consist of a trunk line up and down manhat-
tan island with two branches in the bronx
it will be over twenty-two miles and will cost
 its capacity will be a million
passengers a day or two and a half times the
capacity of the original subway

  over  will be spent on a cross-
town subway running a mile from river to
river under canal street another subway
to be run from the brooklyn end of the wil-
liamsburg bridge to connect with the fourth
avenue subway will cost 

new subways

  already  is being spent to build
the fourth avenue subway in brooklyn run-
ning from the brooklyn end of the new man-
hattanbridge to forty-third street a dis-
tance of four miles two great extensions of
this road are to be built one will run from
the forty-third street terminal to coney
island the other from the same point to fort
hamilton from which place a tunnel will
eventually be built under the narrows to
staten island these two extensions to-
gedier will measure nine miles in length
without counting the eventual extension to
staten island

  still another subway which is now almost
completed runs from the manhattan end of
the williamsburg bridge through delancey
street to the junction of centre street and

  truly it should be a wonderfully changed
city in respect to its transit service five years
from now with this great maze of subterra-
nean roads

  then there is the great problem of han-
dling the commerce of the seas the teeming
city hasnt room for all its ships former
comptroller metz declares that the wheat-
shipping terminal of the continent is now
montreal and that new york has lost this
great traffic because of the crowded condition
of its port and the expense of its docking
facilities

  the demands of the ships are becoming
more and more urgent every year shows a
striking increase in the citys sea traffic in
respect to the number of net registered tons of
shipping entered in the foreign trade new
york has just become the greatest port in the
world

a giant canal

  it has long been ahead of london and
hamburg and recendy it passed its nearest
rival liverpool in  there were 
shipping arrivals at new york and the value
of the goods entered in foreign commerce at
the port was 

  mayor gavnor who is responsible for the
carrying out of this tremendous project has
the best interests of the city of new york
more fully developed than had any other
mayor

  here is a man whose every act since his
election to the greatest municipal office in die
united states is proving that he is destined to
become one of the foremost figures in ameri-
can politics a keen observer a talented
lawyer a judge to whom mercy and human
kindness are factors of the law he is looming
large on the horizon of  as a possibility
for the presidency of the united states such
a man is surely big enough to handle the
ever-growing transit problems of the biggest
city on the american continent

  the present administration hopes to spend
 for new piers twelve millions
of this amount will be spent for acquiring
water-front property and another million will
be set aside for preliminary work on the
jamaica bay improvement in case the bill
which is now before congress providing for
an appropriation for that project should be
passed

  it is proposed that this new harbor be made
the terminal of the barge canal which now
at a cost of over  is being dug
across the state of new york to connect the
hudson with the great lakes to make a
more direct connection with the hudson and
the barge route there is a plan for digging a
canal across long island from jamaica bay

good-by on the

the true story series when you just have to hang on-

boys and let her run when its useless to jump-simply a question of
being dashed to eternity against the rugged rocks of a cut or ground to
death when she collides-then you begin to think and think hard and usually
theres only one thing to do and that is to stay

     and we dont much blame hawkens if he used words that could only be
printed on asbestos when he reached the end of his exciting journey it was
something to be alive to tell the tale

an occurrence in the earfy days of the oregon short line when an eagle-
eye and his mate thought that it was all over except

the floral tributes

true story number forty-seven

ome on now get a move on
  taint no use kickin for you
  got to go an thats all there
  is to it 

this was spoken by a wiper
transformed for the moment
into call-boy after imparting the unwelcome
information that my valuable services were
in demand for a trip west starting at  pm

  it was back in november  at sho-
shone idaho on the oregon short line
tlien in course of construction the track hav-
ing been completed a considerable distance
beyond the above-named city

  i was firing the engine which hauled ma-
terial to the track-laying crew at the  fronf
and ours was the only train operating west
of shoshone at that time except the one at
the  front  which came no farther east
dian kings hill station

  over the track between shoshone and
kings hill station we therefore held undis-
puted sway and might come and go at will
as duty called

  the unexepcted call was not at all to my
liking as most of our work was during the
daytime we had been ordered out-and
that settled it

  it developed that we were to proceed to
reverse with caboose only and there pick up
a train of loads these we were ordered to
take to kings hill nine miles beyond after
which we might return at will no train-
orders being necessary to govern our move-
ments

  between reverse and kings hill stations
there was a drop of nearly nine hundred
feet or ninety-eight feet to the mile for the
entire distance in those days we had no
air on the freight-engines or cars and it

dropping trains down such a grade with hand-brakes was a ticklish business

might be added that in the chaotic condi-
tions incident to track-laying over the desert
engines were in luck to have much of any-
thing else on them frequently we ran out
of oil and were obliged to use melted lard
as a lubricant

  dropping trains down such a grade with
hand-brakes was a ticklish business-nine
or ten miles an hour being the limit of speed

  in due time we reached reverse and made
a flying switch of the caboose to the rear
end of the train standing ready on the siding
coupling the engine to the other end we
waited until the trainmen finished exam-
ining the brakes and couplings

  the steel rails used were thirty feet in
length and as the train stood there were
ten cars of steel next the engine with fifteen
cars of ties behind frequently these rails
were loaded on thirty-foot flats when this
was done the loaders would usually remove
the brake-staff laying it on top of the load
and it frequently would roll off and be lost

  when cars with missing brake-staffs were
found on a train our crew would set them
out at reverse to await the arrival of a car-
repairer to supply the deficiency naturally
when our crew found all brake - staffs in
place and the brake-shoes in good condition
they assumed that all was  o k and gave
us the signal to pull out

  we learned that there had been a whole-

sale theft of brake-chains in the shoshone
yards the cars from which they had been
stolen were set out by our own crew their
condition being discovered between shoshone
and reverse but they had forgotten it in
fact there was not a single brake with a
chain on the entire train except the caboose
and engine tank-brakes

  through some ones blunder the defi-
ciency had been reported to the office in
shoshone as having been remedied and there
being shortage of material at the  front
we were ordered to take them down the hill

  for about two train - lengths from the
switch the track was level and there was no
necessity for brakes until we pitched over
the top of the hill

  hawkens the engineer and i prompdy
coiled up on our respective seat-boxes as soon
as the engine started down the grade the
handling of the train was wholly in the
hands of the crew until kings hill station
was reached but our rest was brief sud-
denly we realized that we were running con-
siderably faster than the kings hill speed
limit

  the track had not received its final sur-
facing and was still rough looking back
we saw the brakemen running toward each
other near the center of the train stopping
at the end of each car to twirl its brake-
wheel and then speed on on top of the
saying good-by on the 



caboose stood the conductor frantically
swinging his lantern to stop

  the brakenien met and facing the engine
added their signals to those of their chief
swinging their lamps so fast that one was
extinguished we couldnt stop were the
train standing still the engine could not have
held the cars she was only a ten-wheeler
carrying  pounds pressure

  after a few violent oscillations of their
lamps the brakenien turned and ran for the
caboose climbing over the cars of ties like
monkeys suddenly it dropped back from
the train

  they had cut the way-car off and left us
to our fate	

  until the caboose dropped back we had
done nothing in fact there was very nearly
nothing to be done but now we awoke to
action

  what is wrong back diere shouted
hawkens

   give it up but ill soon find out and
in an instant i had climbed over the tank
to the first car the brake-wheel twirled in
my hands and a glance disclosed the fact
that it had no chain i raced back four
cars to find each brake in die same condi-
tion the train was making forty miles an
hour and the heavy steel rails began to
grind and shift as the cars
swung over the uneven track

  plainly it was up to me to
sprint for the engine

   well   was hawkenss
greeting and i explained
briefly

   great heavens  he cried

 and chris long holds the
main line at kings hill

  chris long was conductor
of the track-laying train which
was then ded up nights at
kings hill station haw-
kenss exclamation meant that
if we reached the station by
any miracle we would plunge
into the waiting train with
our speed the result could be
easily imagined

  jumping was out of the
question we would have
landed in the rock cuts and
the dumps between were
strewn with great jagged
stones blasted from the cuts

  we were now running fully
a mile a minute and the speed
increasing every second the

  crash of the steel as it bounced up and
down could be heard above the roar of die
train and the des were beginning to fall
from the rear cars bounding high in die air
as they struck

  the engine rolled and pitched fearfully
while behind hung a cloud of dust kicked
up by die speeding cars

  hawkens reached over and grasped my
hand  good-by frank its all over with
us he said

  i can see hawkens to diis day calm
and cool-not even the least bit excited he
was one of diose men who do not seem to
know what the word fear means

  but i did if there was ever an individual
scared plumb stiff - scared thoroughly and
completely through and through-i was that
identical one

  hawkens cut a section from the bell-cord
and tied the wliisde lever down so that it
would blow continuously the crew at
kings hill station might hear it and
guessing what was wrong get their train off
the main line thus giving us a clear track-
if by any chance we reached the station it
seemed that nothing short of a miracle would
keep us on the rails that far

  the old  plunged and rolled fearfully
but she clung to the track as though she

they had cut off the way-car and left us to our fate
	the railroad mans magazine

  knew a wreck meant utter annihilation her
drivers as i leaned from the cab-window
and looked down appeared like solid disks
of iron and her rods flashed up and down
at lightning speed

  suddenly there was a crash and a lurch
which seemed to lift the engine bodily from
the rails i felt each individual hair raise
straight up from my scalp i am sure that

 good-by frank it is all over with us

i bit a chunk off the northwest corner of my
heart

  i sure thought it was the end and said
the first line of  now i lay me -all i
could remember under the stress of circum-
stances-but she ran more smoothly

  the speed was too great a strain and die
 had stripped herself - wrenched off the
driving-pins to which are attached the side
rods connecting the drivers

  luckily neither rod struck the cab and
the straps broke releasing them instantly

  up to this time the internal friction of the
engines machinery had acted as a powerful
brake but how she did run

  the landscape flashed by in a gray streak
and with every lurch an occasional rail
would bounce from a car hurling a shower
of sparks as it struck a rock and then swirl
high in the air

  hawkens said nothing after bidding me
good-by all that we could do was to await
the end and i can tell you boys awaiting
the grim reaper is one of the most soul-try-
ing things ever experienced by mortal man

   it seemed but a matter of seconds after the
engine threw her rods when the slight curve
just east of the station came into view here
indeed was the end

  with closed eyes and stiffened
body i prepared myself on and
on she plunged one moment more
and-

   i felt the engine roitnd the curve
and there was a terrific crash

   my eyes opened to find the train
plunging along over the level des-
ert with the station far to the rear

   it took several moments to realize
the fact that we had actually passed
through so horrible an experience
without harm

   our train ran far beyond the sta-
tion and when it was stopped final-
ly by a slight up-grade the old 
was a sad wreck

  her rods gone guides and yoke
bent and every box on her blazing
she certainly was a sight

   the track-laying engine came out
and pulled us back to the station-
the watchman had heard the roar of
our train and the scream of our whis-
tle guessing what was wrong as
hawkens had hoped he might he
hastily and just in time pulled in
on the siding

   a rail fell from our head car and
utterly demolished the box-car de-
pot though luckily there was no one in it at
the time that was the crash i had heard

  in due time our crew arrived having
dropped the caboose slowly down die hill
what hawkens said to them could only be
printed on asbestos it would set fire to any
other material

   as for me ive ridden pretty fast both
before and since that time but never did
i slip through a bunch of landscape quite so
quickly as on that occasion

   they say that when a man knows its only
a question of a few seconds until death
swoops down on him and sends him into the
great unknown that all the events of his past
life go flitting by in a regular moving-pic-
ture dream but strange to say all i could
think of at the time was what sort of a place
i was going to light on when we struck
terra firma
new mallet
--- type

the chicago burlington and quincy railroad
has received ten mallet compounds of tlie
--- type from the baldwin locomotive works
they are equipped with an emerson fire-tube super-
heater a feed-water heater having a heating sur-
face of  square feet and a reheater consisting
of  -inch tubes  inches long located in a
large -incli flue through the center of the feed-
water heater these locomotives are arranged to
burn lignite and will be used in freight service on
maximum grades of  per cent they are de-
signed to traverse -degree curves

  steam from the throttle-valve says the american
engineer and railroad journal is carried through
the usual dry pipe to the front flue-sheet where it
passes through the t-head into the two super-
heater headers this type of superheater has verti-
cal headers which are simply enlarged steam-pipes
with the proper walls and passages to divide the
saturated and superheated steam sections each
superheater has fourteen elements placed in two
vertical rows of seven each

  the headers have a cross connection at the bot-
tom to act as an equalizer between the superheated
steam compartments

  the high-pressure cylinders are cast separately
from the saddle and the steam from the superheater
passes into a short passage in the saddle from which
it is carried by a short elbow-pipe to a passage in
the center of the cylinders thence to the -inch
valve-chamber the exhaust emerges from the
high-pressure cylinders through a -inch passage on
the back face from which it is carried to a passage
in the saddle by a short section of piping and thence
upward from the center of the saddle through an el-
bow-pipe to the reheater the reheater consists of
two cast-steel headers circular in shape between
which there are  -inch tubes  inches in
length

  these headers have ground ball joints with the el-
bow-pipes at either end the discharge from the re-
heater is carried down to the bottom of the smoke-
box and thence through a flexible receiver-pipe to
a steel casting which forms part of the front frames
and to which the low-pressure cylinders are bolted

  the feed-water heater is of unusual capacity and
in addition to the large central -inch flue has
 j-inch flues distributed over its whole cross-
section it is fed by two non-lifting injectors the
admission being on the center line at either side
and discharge through a check-valve at the top into
the check-valves on the side of the boiler proper
the front section of the boiler is separable from the
rear section the joint being just back of the feed-
water heater and all piping or other parts continuing
by this joint are arranged so as to be easily discon-
nected

the law and the facts

               by j r stafford

              fearing a slow order from the despatch-
              er wright runs the gantlet of misery

ind you must take no
chances wright the
despatcher spoke sharply

  the engineer nodded and
then sidled out of the room
and into the darkness of
the train-sheds he hid himself too for he
was afraid the despatcher would send him a
slow order

  a slow order annuls the schedule it is
given on the theory that a train can crawl
where under speed it would take the ditch
wright wanted no slow order for this trip
this particular night was extra-pulling
the fast mail

  it was foggy the rails would be slippery
and the red and the green like the white
signal-lamps would all shine mistily gray

if as extra he could maintain schedule
speed he would achieve a great triumph and
inevitably promotion to the regular mail run
would be his

  a slow order would shatter the opportunity
which was calling to this ambitious man with
all the eloquence of all his struggling past

  for fifteen minutes he stood in the shadow
of the sheds then when diere was not an-
other second to spare he bounded across the
lighted space beyond which the already coup-
led and waiting mail loomed high and dimly
lit as he looked back from his window
in the cab a lantern far in the rear swung
straight upward and then sharply down

  now just as he put his hand on the little
lever of the air-valve it happened that mil-
ler regular mail-driver for this very run
came along standing just beneath the cab
he stared up at its occupant with the pecul-
iarly sneering smile which says  you will
try but you will fail

  the smile angered wright unaccountably
but this anger was nothing to that which he
felt a moment later for somehow while



fumbling with the air-valve he did not no-
tice that the brake was off wherefore he gave
the lever a very sharp jerk-just as a very
angry man will jerk a horse somedmes

  the result was that the brakes went on
again only diat it was now on the very
dot of leaving-time and the throtde not yet
opened he would have jumped down and he
would have fought

  miller now laughed openly

  since there was promotion ahead or at
least the very good chance of it the engineer
satisfied his lust for vengeance in the
thought that promotion would put miller out
of the mail class he had another reason
for rushing the mail on schedule so he
started off as if nothing had happened

  as he pounded out through the corduroy
of frogs to the yard limits he would have
been happy but for one fact his fireman
was a younger brother to the master mechanic

  it was quite possible that the young man
might on returning to his brother tell of the
confusion in the handling of the brakes
this story possibly might halt the matter of
promotion

  after thinking it over for twenty minutes
wright got a wrench from the tool-box and
after showily pretending to make an adjust-
ment he explained to the coal-passer the
bushing around the valve-stem had slipped
a little it let the handle turn too easily

  the fireman nodded that he understood

  then the engineer crawled back up into
his window and he drove like a jehu of old
his brain was cool as the snows on the sum-
mit of vesuvius his heart and its purposes
as hot as the fires that seethe below

  time that he lost on the up-grades be-
cause of the skip of the wet drivers he made
up on the down-grades by sanding and then
regardless of curves or trestles by giving his
pistons every ounce of steam
the law and the facts



  under him diat engine was his own wild
heart that night a rage a madness to whirl
past clutching accident and to win mightily

  death which is the terror of little men he
had flung out of his account

  as a consequence he came in on time at
the first stop-sixty miles out-and there he
found congratidations from the despatcher
and orders to proceed on schedule

  station after station whipped by like
fleeting things of waking dreams the fog
and the wet night rushed backward as swift-
ly as time himself

  morning came at length when they were
within twenty miles of the end of the run
and were on the schedule to a watch-tick
hurling forward through the gray at seventy
miles an hour a vagrant wind lifted the fog
ahead disclosing far away a team and
wagon stopped upon the track

  there was no need of taking any chance
wright jerked his whistle-cord and softly ap-
plied the air

  to his surprise the valve-handle moved
over easily though without effect upon the
brakes he pushed the handle clear to its
bracket the air was dead

  then the wind died and the fog fell
hiding the disconcert ahead

  just at that moment the fireman looked up
from his poised shcvel and yelled  out of
commission again  

  wright knew it was a question about the
brakes-and he also knew that if he an-
swered truthfully he must stop at the next
siding and report the trouble or else go on
in open violation of an important section of
the book of rules

  secretly he was willing to violate all sec-
tions in order to save this run which would
prove him beyond quibble a great engineer
so he nodded in the negative and shouted
that there was nothing the matter

  he was certain the fireman had not seen
the handle against the bracket he would
wait until they had passed the last siding
in then he would pretend he had just dis-
covered the failure of the brakes

  so when they were within five miles of
the switch-tower which rose like a skeleton
of wan lanterns in the morning grayness he
suddenly put his head around into the gang-
way and shouted the air is dead

  it is not a pleasant thing to be riding at
seventy miles an hour without any brakes es-
pecially when one is but four minutes away
from a gridiron covered with flying switch-
engines and trailing strings of cars

  the fireman uttered a mad oath about en-

gineers who couldnt tell when the brakes
were in trouble and then he fell to dancing
to the wild hornpipe which fear was playing
for his benefit

  wright laughed and throttling down was
soon running under momentum alone by
the time they were at the whistling-post he
was using a little steam again just to keep
moving he stopped on die yard limits
whistled and then trundled slowly down to
the red flag where a hostler from the round-
house waited for the engine as he got
down from the cab he said to this man
 this airs dead it happened just a few
miles back

  then the fireman got down and with
genuine approval he said wright it was
a great run if ever any man ought to be
marked up you certainly should be

  wright felt very good over this he was
sure of his fireman nothing now could bar
his promotion

  up at headquarters where he hurried to
check in half a dozen officials were wait-
ing to congratulate him they looked at
the chalky white dulness which settles under
the eyes of a man who endures a long and
tremendous strain and they pretended that
he had been scared half to death all the way
they conducted themselves generally like
men who are very proud to patronize wright
was not overfond of this business as soon
as he could do it decently he got away

  that afternoon instead of waiting for a
run back as he had a right to he got leave
and went home on the first passenger-train
he wanted to tell his wife and babies all
about what had happened for their approval
was the kind he could accept besides the
higher pay of the better job now certain
would open long vistas of better things for
them he wanted them to know at once

  it was long after midnight when he let
himself into the flat but just the same the
boy and the girl woke up with their mother
and all three of them got out of their beds
and made him tell the story of the run again
and again until he was quite sure that he
was not only a very great man but the hap-
piest one in all the town

  of the foolish things he did the next
morning as soon as he could find shopkeepers
astir it is as well to say little he bought
all the books that his son would never read
all the trinkets for which his wife had not
the slightest use or wish and all the un-
imaginably meaningless gimcracks for which
his little girl could find neither name nor
purpose


the railroad mans magazine

  but he made them happy anyhow and
in doing this he spent-on credit of course
-considerably more than the pay coming to
him

  about ten oclock the telephone rang for
him to answer a call from headquarters he
was wanted at once as this meant his pro-
motion he hurried across the city in all
a schoolboys elation to the despatchers
office

  as he entered the clerks smiled curiously
at him and pointed silently to the door be-
hind which he knew the higher powers were
wont to sit in state and put ordinary mortals
 on the carpet

  now as he was about to enter on a piece
of business very rare in the experience of
engineers he felt very proud he held hi
head high it is to be feared that he held
himself just a trifle too straight but then
of course he did have a right to feel a bit
chest-

  on entering the sanctum sanctorum he was
somewhat surprised to see several persons
who were not usually to be found there

  in the first place besides the despatcher
and the superintendent and the master me-
chanic there was miller what business
could miller halve

  the question bothered him not a little
now that he remembered it he had a grudge
against this engineer for that sneering smile
perhaps miller was to be reduced to the
ranks

  then he wondered about his fireman who
was also in the room but reflecting that this
man had a share in the run he was glad
they were going to honor him also he de-
cided that the very large and severe gentle-
man who looked at every one just as a good
machinist looks at bolts and nuts must be
the general manager

  the despatcher nodded gravely at him but
no one else made a sign of recognition

  this did not seem the proper beginning of
a ceremony for promotion but as his was an
exceptional case he thought perhaps that
the methods might be exceptional

   wright the despatcher said  what
were you doing between the time you left me
night before last and leaving-time

  now if the engineer had been alone with
his questioner he would have answered that
he had been hiding in the sheds for fear of
a slow order but in the hearing of these
other men such an explanation seemed silly
he shifted uneasily on his feet and an-
swered why jist a loafin around in the
sheds that was all

  you are sure you were not doing a
thing   it was the superintendent who
asked

  the superintendent was a stout man with
a stubby nose and an air of vast importance
people grew angry at him without knowing
why

  wright answered him sharply  i suppose
i ought to know

   but you dont suppose other people do
eh   the master mechanic insinuated

  wright stared from one to the other cu-
riously even his show of curiosity could
not hide the anxiety which this meaningless
attack was heaping upon him

   if you had not been doing anything
the master mechanic continued why were
you so nervous when you pulled out were
you afraid of the run  

  me nervous afraid of the run well

i guess not 

  no i suppose you were not afraid of
the run the official admitted but plain-
ly you were nervous about something why
did you come skulking up to your engine at
just the last second and then after releasing
the air-brakes throw them on again when
you already had your high-ball  

  wright hesitated it was clear now that
the fireman had come straight back and told n
of that awkward manipulation of the air at
the start this explained millers presence
also

  deciding that it was unwise to quarrel one
against two in the presence of superiors who
weighed evidence just like other people he
simply answered well i may have been a
mite nervous

   did you tell this man who was firing for
you that the bushing around the air-valve
stem had worked loose the question
flashed from die master mechanics lips like
a shot from an ambush

   yes the engineer faltered being quite
thrown off his guard  i did but-

  he was afraid to go on and tell the whole
story since lie had done nothing wrong
now that he found himself under some
strange suspicion he half doubted his facts
the facts somehow seemed like to get him
into farther trouble

  the general manager took a hand very
slowly he asked my man did you really 
throw off your air then throw it on again
then off a second time after you had your
signal to be under way

  yes i did you see- but since this
only required more extensive explanation
wright hesitated the general manager was
the law and the facts



really a formidable personage he was brief
and direct

  that is enough the great man replied
the case seemed to be closed

   step into the other room a moment
please the despatcher addressed the mys-
tified engineer  i will call you when we
are ready

  wright obeyed - within five minutes he
was recalled

  the despatcher began with grave kind-
ness   my man i greatly deplore this whole
matter and i would feel in a measure re-
sponsible for it but for the fact that your
purposed disabling of your air-brake dis-
closes a cowardice altogether despicable i
felt that i should have given you a slow
order

   i looked round a few minutes after you
stepped out of the office that night intending
to consult with you as to the propriety of a
slow order your fear that you might have
to go on without one seems however to have
forced you to the foolishly desperate thing
you did

  now we have known you to be a good
and faithful employee and fairly skilful
and while there is no properexcuse for such
an act as yours we are going to give you an-
other chance after a thirty-day lay off you
may report for duty we will then do our
best for you

  wright stood petrified in his astonishment
at this outlandish vagary from the lips of a
sane and responsible man

  then he began laughing but as he
laughed he saw that they exchanged most sig-
nificant glances sudden anxiety filled him
and when he knew this showed in his face
he saw them smile as if they were now quite
sure of him

  beyond doubt it was up to him to clear
away the folly of these men so he prepared
to open a discussion on broad facts

   gendemen he said  i took the mail
over the division on schedule time i dont
understand this quibblin about the air but
it looks to me that a man could hardly run
sixty mile an hour for a little over nine hours
if he had lost his nerve im not much on
argyin points but id like to have some o
ye answer me that

   you might not need an answer if you
would admit that we know the facts the
master mechanic snapped but since you
dont admit them ill explain

    after you fixed the air-brake it was not
immediately out of commission it would
not be either until the loose piece of packing

worked into the right spot in the air-pipe
naturally just like any other man who could
do such a trick you reasoned that it wouid
be unwise to discover trouble until it was
apparent to your fireman

   knowing as you did that at any moment
your deliverance from schedule speed might
take place through the gradual working of
the clog of packing you could drive to the
very limit you would drive to the very
limit too because that would very likely
cover your tracks

  say wright demanded fiercely what
sort of a frame-up is this ill punch some-
bodys head for this

   punch your own  the master mechanic
advised

  at this every one laughed so heartily that
wright was constrained to believe there must
be some humor in the situation

  it struck him that this was a great deal
like the promotion tactics of certain secret
orders to which he belonged the notion in
view of his own undoubted facts seemed
tenable he smiled foolishly like a candi-
date who has just ridden the goat and then
like a waiting candidate he waited

  my man said the despatcher quietly

 we are now done with you keep straight
and report in thirty days drop into the of-
fice once in a while and let us know you are
alive

   oh the engineer gasped with a fatuous
smile dont i git my promotion now
aint you done with the foolishness

  foolishness the despatcher stood
aghast  my man we were never more in
earnest in our lives and as for your pro-
motion let me tell you sir that we have
violated every precedent in not discharging
you

  wright turned to the door he opened it
at last he swung it shut behind him still
they did not call him back

  he remained in the outer office until near
noon but when the officials came out they
passed by obviously avoiding the sight of
him he went outside then and wandered in
the yards for two hours but he found no
friend nor any clue to cheer him

  at length he came back to the office and
sat down on the bench opposite the bulletin-
board

  a new notice posted there caught his eye
it was his suspension for thirty days

  now all this was so preposterous that he
determined on immediately setting things
right regardless of consequences so wheel-
ing round he pushed open the gate in the


the railroad mans magazine

railing and notwithstanding the clerks
strode to the door of the private office

  without knocking or hesitating he opened
it and stepped in

  the despatcher laid down his cigar with
a smile and said i told them you would
break in to own up avhen you took a notion
im glad you came it would have disap-
pointed me if you hadnt come at all it
would have been very unflattering to our in-
telligence now own up and then we can
start again with a fair understanding

   say wright demanded  dye know
why i left ye the other night did ye know
i left because i was afraid ye would gimme
a slow order well thats the size of it
the official put one hand over his mouth
while with the other he pretended to fan him-
self he laughed immoderately

  you fellers-the engineer lost all con-
trol of himself now- are a bunch o luna-
tics in this deal say dye know that i took
the mail through on time when they wasnt
any other man on the whole job here that
would have tried it

  dye think that a man that will risk his
life that way for a better job is goin to lay
down because a lot of dumbheads over him
have got their wires crossed

   say i took that train through the way i
did because i knowed no other engineer could
do it i done it because ive been an en-
gineer for sixteen years and been willin all
the time to take every chance that might lead
me a little nearer to the top 

  there was something so meaning in his
tone and manner that it bespoke real desper-
ation

  the despatcher stared at him for a full
minute smiling curiously he replied

  very well in view of what you say
there may be a very excellent reason for our
reconsideration of this matter in fact i
shall have it reconsidered at once

   when can i git your answer  

   we will act rather for our own enlighten-
ment than yours but die finding will per-
haps be had to-morrow

  there was something akin to threat in die
despatchers manner

  suddenly wright felt abashment at the
diought that his intrusion on this man must
have been the cause of offense he sham-
bled out of the room

  three days later when he was able to
bring himself back to headquarters he dis-
covered that his name had been taken from
the bulletin-board

  he stumbled over to his pigeonhole in the

engineers rack on the wall he fished out
of it a thin yellow envelope his fingers
shook so diat he could barely tear the paper
but at length he succeeded a check for
all the money due him from the company
fluttered in his grasp but the certainty of his
discharge was what the bit of paper really
conveyed

  discharge when a man has every right to
expect promotion is of course heart-break-
ing but discharge under suspicion is even
a more terrible matter this is especially
true when the unfortunate has spent liis prime
in fitting himself for a work from which the
least suspicioned are always jealously ex-
cluded wrights knees shook under him as
he left the place

  he walked slowly down through the sheds
toward the network of tracks beyond which
a mile distant the roundhouse lay long and
low in smoke

  miller sauntering met him and smiled
that same triumphantly sneering smile which
seemed to sav  you will try but you will
fail

  wright understood die whole matter now
it was clear that this old rascal fearing re-
tirement to the- lower pay of a less important
run had in some way engineered diis whole
trouble

  he was disposed to knock him down and
half kill him right there still he reflected
that it was the loss of his job and not mil-
lers hand in it diat was likely to ruin him
so he grinned as affably as he could and
stopped miller stopped too

  youre off to-day the older man in-
quired with the peculiar impudence of one
who knows there could not possibly be any
doubt in the matter

  yes wright answered just for to-
day i got some persona business to attend
to im a lookin for the scalawag diat tin-
kered that air-brake on my engine

   jist between you an me i have to per-
tend that im fired the despatcher is a
going to do the same thing we figger diat
this dub wont find out that anything is sus-
picioned of him then some day or odier
hell git funny an give it all away

  millers mouth gaped and his eyes bulged
he seemed to pull himself together and said
he believed it was a fine scheme but that he
was in a terrible hurry and must go

  he started toward headquarters as if he
expected some one from behind was about to
take a shot at him

  even in his dilemma wright was amused
he went on toward the roundhouse
the law and the facts



  the wipers and hostlers were friendly with
him so he had no trouble getting inside-
nor was he asked to explain why he loafed

  by nightfall he had learned two things
miller had been in the cab of that engine
that night and had actually run it up from
the roundhouse half-way to the station the
other fact was that by taking out the bush-
ing around the air - valve stem one might
loosen the packing and crowd it down into
the pipe with the blade of a pocket-knife

  he knew now just what had been done
just when it had been accomplished and how
-and also who was responsible

  but next day when lie came back every
one laughed at him after a long time he
learned that the despatcher and the others
had discharged him because they thought he
had tampered with the air in order to make
his run appears the more marvelous and as
this was a thing that really he might have
done too - had he thought of it - he was
struck with a kind of helpless notion that
somehow this business fitted him so closely
that lie would never get rid of it

  nevertheless he hung around the yards
and the roundhouse there was nothing else
for him to do

  though he had become quite hopeless
just as a man does when he dreams that facts
are not as enduring as the hills he still tried
to plan some coup after four days he de-
cided on one then he went down to head-
quarters and finding miller said

   i got next to it and what happened to
me is a goin to happen to the very feller
that done me

  miller hurried into the despatchers office

  wright got out of the building as quickly
as he could hiding himself behind a pile
of trunks he peeped and presently saw mil-
ler and the despatcher come out and look
around as if they searched for some one

  then the despatcher laughed and made
signs at miller like a father when he thinks
the imagination of the son has been playing
him tricks

   go off wright heard the official advise
 and soak your head wrights not here
and i dont believe he has been i cant
imagine whatever put it into you to come
with such a story even if it was so if i
hear of it again im going to have you test-
ed for something more than your eyesight

  the watcher saw him turn back into the
building

  but as miller came slowly down the plat-
form wright slipped along from pillar to
pillar and truck to truck keeping abreast and

yet concealed at the far end of the sheds
however he came boldly out and said
now i have you 

  instead of replying miller jumped side-
wise and hurried down through the yards

  wright smiled and sat down at the end of
the shed until he had seen miller vanish
into the smoke-cloud of the roundhouse he
did not stir then he got up and ran down
there as fast as he could he lurked along
from stall to stall until he came to that one
in which stood the engine for the mail run
that night

  sure enough miller was sitting up in the
cab just as if it were about leaving-time
two or three wipers were gathered round the
footboard they were trying to find out
what he was doing when he would not an-
swer they advised him to look at his watch
and see if it were five hours fast

  wright sat down outside

  after two hours it was six oclock and
the day wipers were leaving for the night
while the night force came stringing in with
their lunch-baskets on their arms

  wright saw miller get down out of the cab
and start as if to come toward him then
he showed himself

  miller fell back and began asking a greasy
helper for a bit of supper but the helper
wanted to know why an engineer needed to
have his meals carried to him when he was
off duty and receiving no explanation kept
his bread and cheese

  wright continued to sit at the door like a
terrier at a rat-hole

  when nine-forty oclock came miller
crawled out of his cab and calling a hostler
ordered him to take the engine up to the sta-
tion the man shook the piece of waste
with which he was wiping brass and spat on
the ground

  not on your tintype he growled do
you reckon im goin up there jist to walk
back an you a goin well i guess not
whoever heard of such a thing  

  no one had a half-dozen of his fellows
had now gathered round him and they took
his part

  miller when he saw he must backed die
engine slowly out upon the switch

  just as the footboard was passing the
stall-door wright swung himself up and in-
side the cab as soon as the engine struck
the main switch he said now miller
loosen up that bushin

  miller turned around hunger and anx-
iety also was in his face and he would
have been very angry had he dared but he


the railroad mans magazine

was afraid so he tried to smile he was
like a boy caught with a stolen watermelon

  loosen that bushin wright command-
ed again and as if to enforce his order he
picked up the coal-hammer

miller got his wrench and worked slowly

  whoa wright snapped shut down
stop right here till ye git it done 

  as he spoke he lifted the hammer with
the apparent purpose of bringing it down on
the other mans head

  miller shut down

  now jist be quick about the business
ye know how its done yer an expert
an its well ye are one otherwise ye
wouldnt git up to the station in time to git
out

  miller took out the bushing and started to
put it back again

  loosen the packin first 

  the packing was jabbed and jabbed

  do it right the intruder thundered
 ye got to fix it so die handle jist goes
around of itself whenever ye touch it - or
ye dont git away 

  presently miller announced that the job
was perfect evidendy it was for the air
seemed entirely out of commission

   hold  a minute longer  wright or-
dered

  it was now within two minutes of leav-
ing-time and the distance up to the station
was a quarter of a mile when the minute
was up wright swung down into the dark-
ness and he stood there until he saw that
miller in his anxiety to get coupled up was
backing under a big head of steam then he
went home

  the next morning early four policemen
and a couple of deputy sheriffs came to his
house and took him to the police court

  the despatcher the superintendent and
the master mechanic were diere already and
diey had miller and four lawyers with
them

  the police judge was a very busy man
he could not be otherwise as he was per-
mitted only to send to the workhouse peo-
ple who should be hanged wherefore they
were always coming back to him

  for the same reason he was petulant as
a man always is when he knows the job will
have to be done over again next week or next
month

  he peered sharply over his spectacles at
wright and spoke just as if he were shoot-
ing at him with an automatic pistol

you starved this man yesterday you
assaulted him you made him break his en-

gine you made him back into his train so
fast that he couldnt stop he made a hor-
rible mess of the mail he tied everything
up over diere in die switch-yards for half an
hour last night what have you to say  
now miller who had winced at this reci-
tal of his accident made haste to venture an
explanation as men in such situations as his
often do

  the judge turned as if to devour him
whats this you act and talk like a
very smart man no doubt of it perhaps
you know better how to conduct this case
than this court perhaps you had better tell
the whole story 

  a very wise man would have seen that
this was nothing more than an invitation to
step out and be squelched

  but miller was very sure of his facts
moreover he did not want the newspaper
reporters to go off with the impression that
it was his awkwardness that had tied up the
mail so he told in great fulness just what
had happened

  he even went back to the night when
wrights trouble had occurred and ex-
plained how his own presence on the plat-
form might have given wright suspicion
so far as die mere wording and the facts
it was a pretty well-told story but it lacked
one great quality to make it ring true

  it lacked millers resentment for what
wright had done and lacking this it
seemed the most absurd yarn ever told in a
police court

   every one laughed at the story-tellers dul-
ness every one but the judge he half-rose
out of his chair and thundered one hun-
dred days for this miller mr clerk mark
the arraignment as for perjury and conspi-
racy discharge this man wright for if
wright really did what he is charged with
doing then its a moral cinch he was doing
it to undo something this old fraud had done
to him next case

  as wright stepped out into the street the
despatcher took him by the arm and demand-
ed say howabout it anyhow

   i guess the judge was right the engi-
neer replied

  say old man the despatcher was
now steering him down the pavement at a
great rate  there is no use trying to go
over the heads of these courts ive seen
what happens to a man that tries it but you
just let me shake your hand every time i see
you the rest of my days well let the whole
matter from start to finish abide by the
judges decision
ten thousand miles by rail

by gilson wllets

special traveling correspondent of the railroad mans magazine

mr willets met an i c man at new orleans to whom he said  i am
after  g a r yarns south of the potomac the railroad man smiled
blandly and handed our traveling correspondent a card on which was in-
scribed   glad u kum then mr willets explained that  g a r seemed
a bit unusual and treason-like to him

     the mason and dixon line is a dead one down here said the i c man
  g a r in the south stands for grand army of the rail and then this
good fellow coupled a few yarns onto the willets special-story train he
told among others the story of how colonel lampton and four hundred husky
railroad boys drove the last outlaws from louisiana which proves that railroad-
ing in the south has been as strenuous as railroading in the west

    to say that we thank the boys who have given mr willets these good
yarns is to express the smallest part of our appreciation youre all right
boys and  heres to you  from the con in the magazine caboose

no -the g a r south of the potomac

the louisiana outlaws-mark twains oratory-is it a he or a she
the pajama party-coble the hero-money to burn-the
kindness of railroad men and others

tectives had a lot of experience in this parish
three years ago wiping out train-robbers who
were holding up i c trains about every
third night

  im going to borrow some of those de-
tectives and begin a war of extermination on
this bamber crowd either the outlaws
leave the parish or this company ceases busi-
ness

  this happened at kentwood louisiana in
tangipahoa parish about eighty miles north
of the crescent city the bambers was the
name given to those who objected to the new
logging railroad which the banner company
had recently built through the parish-a
twelve-mile line connecting with the i c
at kentwood where the company had the
largest of its lumber mills

series began la june railroad mans mag at inc slagle copies  cents

             lampton president of
             banner logging and rail-
             d company received a let-
             written in glaring red ink
              bearing the alarming sign
             of the skull and crossbones
             and reading thus

this is he last warning stop running your

 railroad	the bambers

   the bambers be hanged  exclaimed
president lampton

  he called in mr preston the superintend-
ent of his railroad showed him the letter
and said

  im going down to new orleans to-day
to see the illinois central division superin-
tendent about this matter some of his de-


the railroad mans magazine

  from kentwood the line ran east togill-
town the stronghold of the baniber gang-
the last outlaws left in louisiana their lead-
er being wicked monroe bamber

  the first shot in this war was fired by the
bainbers on the very day that president
lampton received the skull-and-crossbones
letter and went down to new orleans in
quest of the help of illinois central detec-
tives

  that same morning four men led by
monroe bamber himself jumped aboard the
engine of the logging train at gilltown the
eastern terminus of the little road the out-
laws compelled the men in the cab to start
the train for kentwood threatening both with
instant death

  thus the b ambers took possession of the
train and ran it down the line stopping at
every place where the banner company had
men at work and warning them to quit their
jobs at once or die along the line they
nailed to the trees written warnings to the
companys workmen to leave the parish

varnado the valiant falls

  at one place at which the b ambers stopped
the train they found a gang of section-hands
bossed by de witt varnado varnado was
ordered to call his men off or suffer the pen-
alty of death

  the section - boss after listening to the
threats deliberately turned his back on the
outlaws and ordered his men to proceed with
their work

  then the first shot was fired in the war
of the bambers and the banners it was
fired at the brave varnado and was followed
at once by two more shots the third killing
him his men horrified witnesses of the
murder abandoned their work and took to
the woods

  down the line the train proceeded the
bambers keeping the engineer and fireman
covered with rifles till the end was reached
flere monroe bamber and his three pals
rushed into the office of the banner com-
pany confronted superintendent preston and
informed him that unless he quit his job he
would be killed

  out of the building the desperadoes
marched the superintendent warning him that
if he was found within the parish the next
day he would be shot they returned to the
train and again compelled the engineer to
run back to the eastern terminal

  arriving at gilltown the bambers found
that the section-boss at that point william

magee had kept his men at work all day
though he like all the other section-bosses
had been told to quit

  an hour later magee while on his way
home walked into an ambush and was mur-
dered by the bambers three bullets piercing
his body

mustering flis army

  that night president lampton returned
from new orleans and was told of the above
happenings

  ill fight em he shouted fight em
to a finish 

  president lampton had come down to
louisiana from michigan he got his fight-
ing blood from the gridleys being a cousin
of the naval captain who had achieved fame
at manila on receiving deweys command
you may fire when ready gridley

  president lamptons first move was to rush
over to the illinois central station and send
a telegram to the superintendent at new or-
leans requesting that the detectives be sent
up that night by special train

  he sent another wire to new orleans or-
dering four hundred rifles and ammunition
he ordered two of his men to scour the coun-
try find four hundred horses and hire every
one of them

  he returned to his office and summoned
all the men connected with the banner rail-
road to appear at headquarters immediately
he sent similar word to every one of his mill-
hands the railroad men and mill-hands
mustered four hundred strong

  mr lampton addressed his boys after
reciting the story of the expulsion of super-
intendent preston and the murder of the
two section-bosses and all the rest of the
lawless work of the bambers he announced
that his mills at kentwood would close
down that the railroad would cease running
and that he would organize all the men there
assembled into a regiment-every man to be
armed and mounted-to proceed against the
bambers

their banners flew high

   our charge on the camp of the bambers
will go down into history as the charge of
the four hundred of tangipahoa parish
mr lampton concluded now then will
you boys rally to the standard of the ban-
ner company in the name of public safety
and community progress or wont you 

we will thundered the four hundred
ten thousand miles by rail



 down in virginia

engineer bell and fire-

mcguire closed his watch saying  its all over boys

man burton sat in the cab of
the  waiting for the sig-
nal to get out brakeman
shoemaker shouted to super-
intendent reese master me-
chanic lewis and super-
intendent of rolling - stock
sanderson that the pullman
sleepers were way down at
the end of the train and diat
they would have to get a
skate on

  conductor aicguire shout-
ed let her go bell then
hopped aboard the first train
to run over the virginia
railway

  this happened at  on
april fools night  the
place the historical train
started from was roanoke

virginia it consisted of
twelve passenger-coaches and
two pullman sleepers loaded
with business men of vir-
ginia and west virginia
through which the new road
ran for a distance of four
hundred and forty miles from norfolk to
deepwater

  the passengers were bound for norfolk
to take part in the festivities m honor of
die opening of  the road diat rogers
built

  the next day was the greatest in the exist-
ence of the late henry huddleston rogers

  he himself said so even though he had
put money into the virginia railway with
a shovel-thirty whole millions of dars
and all of it out of his own cash-bin

told the crowd that he was happy as a prince
with just the bulliest new toy-a railroad
that would help a lot of people in virginia
and west virginia to acquire a degree of
prosperity such as they had never known
before

the orator of the day

  engineer bell having been dianked by
mr rogers for bringing the first train safe-
ly down the line then followed mr rogers
and mark twain and the crowd over to the

  two weeks later the war of the banners
and the bambers ended in victory for the
banners

  the bambers who could muster only a
hundred men against the four hundred armed
and mounted soldiers on the banner side
agreed to surrender provided they be taken
to new orleans where they
would be safe from lynching

  president lampton agreed
to the condition-and within
a week the banner trains
were running as usual and
the mills were again in full
blast

  the road was now all paid for and mr
rogers and his friend mark twain the
late samuel l clemens were at the nor-
folk station to witness the arrival of the
first train over the line

  when engineer bell jumped down from
the cab mr rogers shook his hand and


the railroad mans magazine

monticello hotel where a great public re-
ception was held

  with engineer bell went many other boys
of the new virginia railway and when the
reception began some of them stood near the
receiving-line and watched the handshakers
pass by

  there were fully a thousand handshakers
in line and when the doors opened those at
the head started in by shaking the hand of a
man with long white hair and a long white
mustache congratulating him upon the com-
pletion of his railway

  engineer bell hearing the words addressed
to the white-haired man in question snick-
ered at the same time fireman burton
simpered conductor mcguire chuckled and
brakeman shoemaker laughed out loud

  moreover among those who stood near the
white-haired man was governor swanson of
virginia noticing what was happening he
did his best to suppress a smile while united
states senators daniel and martin stared in
amazement

  when the thousand business men of vir-
ginia and west virginia had shaken hands
with those on the receiving-line the crowd
yelled

   speech rogers rogers 

  the white-haired man who had been con-
gratulated by so many of the crowd mounted
a chair and said

  my friends while i have been shaking
your hands i have listened to some very fine
compliments i could not help but feel flat-
tered as you passed me and thanked me so
sincerely for the splendid road i had built
through your state i like compliments
gentlemen and i thank you

   we want rogers

  these words caused a great roar of laugh-
ter and for the first time those who had con-
gratulated the speaker realized that they had
made a mistake

  speech again roared the crowd we
want rogers 

  this time arose another white-haired man

   gentlemen he said  it is my business
to build railroads i employ my orator here
to talk about them and he laid his hand on
the shoulder of the speaker who had preceded
him mark twain

  five weeks passed - only a short five
weeks after that happy day in the life of
henry huddleston rogers engineer bell
and fireman burton sat again in the cab
of the -not at roanoke but way down

the line at a lonely spot in the hills of west
virginia the train had come to a stop

  conductor mcguire and brakeman shoe-
maker were standing beside the engine mc-
guire holding his watch and consulting it
from moment to moment

  finally mcguire removed his cap engi-
neer bell and fireman burton also uncov-
ered

  mcguire closed his watch saying its
allover boys

  at that moment all that was left of henry
huddleston rogers was being placed in a
sarcophagus at fairhaven massachusetts

  all the wheels of th new virginia rail-
way were standing still and all its employ-
ees were standing motionless with bared
heads

the sex of a locomotive

  mr richards is the industrial agent of the
southern railway he is an all-round hus-
tler and whooper-up of the superior advan-
tages of life in the southerns territory he
has been on his job for years and knows the
field south of the potomac as thoroughly as
any division superintendent knows his own
division

  mr richards is moreover the editor and
publisher of all the southerns literature per-
taining to farms mines manufactures im-
migration and homesteads-a large quan-
tity of which literature was given to me by
the chief clerk at mr richardss washington
headquarters

  from the pamphlets i made one clipping
put it in my pocket then went out to the rail-
road yards beyond the union station stopped
in at the hostlers shanty that stands within
the shadow of the capitol made the ac-
quaintance of the engineers gathered there
took out my clipping and said

 you all know mr richards dont you
 bet we do hes to the southern rail-
way what secretary wilson is to the govern-
ment hes the grand master farmer of the
outfit

   hes something more than that i said
 hes a novelist a poet and a prince of de-
scriptive writers i made the discovery about
forty-five minutes ago for example here is
his description of a locomotive i clipped
it from one of his monthly agricultural pa-
pers it appears under a picture of one of
the southerns new engines let me read
it to you

  i read as follows

    the horse of steel stands at the head of all
   material creations of man with a good way
ten thousand miles by rail

he crawled on and on
toward brown summit

for his feet he moves along a thing of beauty
and of use beyond compare he presses for-
ward as incessantly as the minutes and hours
he has intelligence listens to the banging of
the wheels to test their soundness has pleasure
when his joints are eased with oil keeps tab on
his driver peers ahead with his cyclopean eye
anxious to make time and connections without
trying to pass a brother on the same track or
go nose down in the water or be forced off
sidewise over an embankment this elephan-
tine horse has individuality and character he
has a will of his own and fixed habits even as
the ship of the sea

  he  exclaimed one of the southerns
 engineers hy davis humph  he added

 - whatyou humphing about asked one
 of hy daviss confreres of the throttle
 that writin is o k and all to the good

a  he  or a  she 

  he  repeated hy contemptuously  a

 across the way protested another

  but shes got a lap  cried hv

 true a locomotives got a lap yes shes
 a sure-enough female

 which proves said hy  that richards
 aint a real railroad man hes just a nov-

 elist when he wrote about the steel horse
 he meant the steel mare

the pajama party

talking about mr richards not being a
railroad man said that same hy davis as
i walked down the yard with him  reminds
me of trainman lew jacobs

 lew was in that wreck three weeks ago
down near greensboro north carolina when
no  on the southern dropped twenty-
five feet from a trestle into a river like an
elevator dropping from a third story to the
cellar

   when it was all over except the hospital
attendance and the funerals lew found him-
self sitting on top of a pullman alongside of
a dark-skinned man with a black mustache
who suddenly took off his overcoat and threw
it over to dry land to a woman who really
needed it for the smash had come before
getting-out-of-bed time in the morning

   the dark-skinned man having thrown
his overcoat to the woman was now arrayed
just as he was when thrown from his berth
-in blue pajamas lew looked him over a v
moment then said

    youre all right sir yes you are ill
help you down off this roof

    youre one of the trainmen are you
not replied the shivering man never
mind me you go help the others first im
a railroad man myself-and ill wait

    youre a railroad man eh  said lew
then he sprang the moth-eaten and moss-
covered test like this what time do you
guess it might be sir 

    i should say about half past seven was
the answer


the railroad mans magazine

   thereupon lew looked sideways at the
dark-skinned man a moment then said

    you aint been a railroad man long
have you  

  why do you ask that the pajama-
man inquired

    because among us railroaders the time
is about seven-thirty you better let me
help you down 

    go help the others first said the shiv-
ering man curdv  ill take care of my-
self

let george do it

  well lew slipped off the roof of the
pullman into the water and swam across to
where a shattered day-coach lay on its side
in the stream from which conductor coble-
good old georgie coble-was just pulling
himself loose he was pretty well battered
and hardly able to stand on his feet when
lew came up coble said to him

    saw you talking to george gould is
he hurt much  

  trainman lew jacobs gasped looked
across at the pajama-man on top of the car
then said

    what name did you say  

    george gould jay goulds son presi-
dent of the mop and a few other roads
howd he come out of this 

    hes all right but im all in wrong
lew replied  mr coble he added  i want
to tell you that this here business of trying
to spot a real railroad man by just askin
him the time o day is all on the gabosh and
isnt worth a picayune as a test

   then lew jacobs got as busy as a gas-
meter helpin victims from the wreckage-
goin fast as he could to everybody in sight
but carefully avoiding that pajama-man
perched on top of the pullman

a con named coble

   and now continued hy davis  let me
just tell you the name of the one largest hero
among the crew of that wrecked train he
was that selfsame conductor who asked lew
jacobs about the health of
george gould - conductor
georgie coble that con-
ductor im telling you was
himself badly injured and
some shattered as to nerves
yet he had courage left and
to spare you just bet

     whatd he do well
 this is what he did

     georgie coble allowed
  that all those who were able-
  bodied ought to stay at the
  wreck to give first aid yet
  some one would have to go
  to the nearest telegraph of-
  fice and send for a relief
  train and georgie coble
  allowed that the man who
  ought to go after the relief
  was himself

     the nearest telegraph
  office was two miles away-
  and maybe three it was at
  brown summitnorth caro-
  lina and toward that place
  georgie coble now began
   making his way

     he stumbled along for
  a furlong or so then took to
  his hands and knees and
  crawled over the ties-for
  ini telling you that coble
  was badly injured and
ten thousand miles by rail	

while he was crawlin he was sufferin all
kinds of agony

   he had not only been smashed in the
wreck but had narrowly escaped from drown-
ing and so he was sick at his stomach
and his clothes soakin wet and the decem-
ber morning awful cold-still he crawled on
and  toward brown summit at last ar-
rivin at the telegraph station on his hands
and knees

   just as he finished telling the operator
there what to do georgie coble lost all
knowledge of things here on earth

   pretty soon the relief train that coble
ordered came down from greensboro

    im telling you to make a note that the
hero of the wreck at reedy fork trestle
about the time of the last pay-day of nine-
teen-nine was a conductor named coble

money to burn

  thomas franconia foreman of wreckers
of the washington southern railway was
taking a nap in the caboose attached to his
wrecking outfit while it stood at fredericks-
burg virginia when he received an order to
hustle down the line to a point south of
woods lane where a freight and an ex-
press had come together in a rear-ender
when franconia arrived at the wreck he
learned that fire had brokenout immediately
after the collision diat six oil-tank cars had
burst open and that the flames of the burn-
ing oil had set fire to the two express-cars at
the head of the passenger-train and to about
half of the cars of the freight-train

   when you see tankers burnin said
franconia to his men light your pipes and
sit down and take it easy

   he lighted his pipe and puffed away his
men doing likewise

  there aint nothing else to do fran-
conia went on when you go up against
burning oil there aint no use in trying to
put out the blaze cause you just cant do it

   the heat became so intense that franconia
and his gang were obliged to move farther
from the fire

   when the oil had at last burned out fran-
conia and his wreckers put the hose on the
wreckage cooled it off and then began clear-
ing away-dumping everything down an em-
bankment

  franconia saw one of his men toss down
the embankment a chunk of metal mixed with
earth then another chunk and another
other men joined the first one and with
desperate haste began tossing down still more

  along came a farmer who picked up one
of the chunks examined it for a moment
then started away with it

   hey there  called franconia  put
that stuff back where you found it

worth while

  franconia had noted that the lumps of
metal had a peculiar shiny appearance he
tumbled down the embankment picked up
one lump scrutinized it closely then sud-
denly shouted up to the engineer of the loco-
motive pulling his wrecking outfit

   back down and bring up that empty
coal-car 

   when the car was brought up to the wreck
franconia gave this order to his gang

   come down here and pick up all these
chunks youve been throwing away and load
em in that car

  the men assuring one another in under-
tones that the foreman had suddenly gone
crazy proceeded to carry the chunks back
up the embankment

  now said franconia to the engineer
when he had made sure that every last lump
was loaded pull that car up to washing-
ton

    what fool job is this youre giving me
asked the engineer  whats the good of
hauling that worthless stuff up to washing-
ton  

  a treasury agent will meet you said
franconia ignoring the engineers protest
ill wire up-and when you get to wash-
ington the treasury agent will do the rest

    i know said the engineer after think-
ing a moment those are chunks of sil-
ver

  right you are my boy silver dollars
and halves and quarters there were chests
of money in those express-cars and the heat
of the burning oil reduced em to scrap
mixed with other metal and dirt

  it was true the treasury department
had shipped  in silver in one of the
express-cars the messenger was killed in
the collision so the wreckers were left in
ignorance of the value of the cargo until
franconia made the discovery the silver
having left washington as money was now
returned with franconias compliments as
bullion

the good samaritan

  mr la baume is to the norfolk and
western what mr richards is to the south-

s


the railroad mans magazine

ern railway he is the agricultural and in-
dustrial agent he brings settlers to his ter-
ritory and then shows them how to make a
crop grow where none grew before

  when the settlers get their houses built
and their crops started mr la baume takes
out special agricultural trains with expert
lecturers and helps the settlers some more
when a settler gets into trouble on the n
and w mr la baume personally hastens to
the rescue

  twas the night before christmas at the
roanoke headquarters of the norfolk and
western not a railroad wheel was stirring
except in the station clock the reason no
wheels were going round was because they
didnt dare the magic city was shroud-
ed in a fog so thick that locomotive drivers
couldnt see an engines length ahead

   its the limit said general passenger-
agent bevill to mr la baume as the two
groped around trying to find the gate leading
into the grounds of the hotel opposite the n
and w general offices

   its like london answered mr la
baume if no  gets in here to-night
shell have to crawl in on her hands and
knees shes due now

  it was then midnight a prolonged loco-
motive whistle was heard

  its  whistling in said la baume

  about a half-hour after the train was safe
in the station a man rushed into the roan-
oke hotel found mr la baume and cried

   come down to the station theres a
woman there with eleven children she lost
her husband down the line and wants the
railroad to find him

the mother of eleven

  mr la baume foutrd that the woman with
eleven children was a bohemian immigrant
whose husband charles krieger had left the
train at bluefield west virginia saying that
he was going for something to eat he did
not return and the train went on without
him

  the missing husband had all the railroad
tickets and baggage-checks but the crew
brought the mother and her eleven children
on to roanoke

  the chief train-despatcher wired to blue-
field asking if anything had been seen of a
man named charles krieger hour after
hour passed and then at four oclock in the
morning came the answer saying that krie-
ger had been found-hanging by the neck to
an apple-tree

                               

  the mother of the eleven children was in-
formed of the suicide and all the rest of the
night and all christmas day she remained
in the station waiting for the coming of the
train bearing the body of her husband

  every kindness was shown by the station
men who passed around a hat and collected
a goodly sum for the widow

  meantime mr la baume learned that the
fatherless party was bound for the bohemian
colony at estes virginia which mr la
baume by his own enterprise had founded
and furnished with settlers and watched grow
up to a thriving town no  pulled in with
the body of the suicide mr la baume took
the train with them and their dead at mid-
night and proceeded to petersburg a five-
hour ride keeping him up all night

  at petersburg he hired carriages and drove
the party down to estes a seven-mile ride
there he turned the bereaved family over to
friends and the widow insisted upon kissinu
the hand of the railroad man who had be-
friended her

discipline his hobby

  charlie griffin the train-caller at the ter-
minal station at atlanta was a stickler for
discipline he wouldnt break a rule made
by mr blount the station-master-no not
for love nor money

  if he happened to see another man break-
ing one of mr blounts rules it hurt grif-
fins conscience so much that he would
proceed to act for and in behalf of the sta-
tion-master by gently but firmly leading the
rule-breaker back to a proper respect for mr
blounts measures

  imagine train - caller griffins indigna-
tion when just after shouting notice of the
departure of the  five-twenty dixie flier for
west point new orleans and all points
south on track no  he beheld a ticket-
seller standing in the waiting-room with a
long black breva clinched between his teeth

   dont you know its against rules to
smoke in this room cried the wrathful
train-caller showing teeth roosevelt style

  mind your own business replied the
ticket-seller

  aghast at such defiance of the rules the
train-caller went to mr blount and reported
the heinous breach of discipline the sta-
tion-master promptly called the offender on
the carpet

  wasnt smoking a little bit he said
 my cigar was not lighted and you grif-
fin -turning to the train-caller- you lie 
ten thousand miles by rail



   just for that answered the train-caller
in suppressed anger his face lurid with the
harvard colors  ill punch you so youll
look like youve been through a thrashing-
machine ill do it the first time i catch you
outside of this building

  when you get up against me griffin
youll find yourself merely the ilea on the
lion said the other

  the next morning the two men met out-
side of the building a whole block from the
discipline of the station the ticket-seller
had for company a number of railroad men
the train-caller was alone

  well here i am griffin cried the for-
mer ready with that thrashing-ma-
chine   

the other cheek

  to the amazement of the railroad man
what do you suppose happened then the
train-caller instead of closing in on his op-
ponent merely smiled took off his cap exe-
cuted a chesterfieldian bow and said
sweetly

  nothing doing gents

   mollycoddle  muttered the ticket-seller
 go as far as you like answered the
train-caller you cant get a rise out of
me he passed on with his head high

   well dont that beat all  said one of
the railroad men here we were lookin
for that train-caller to show us some stunts
instead lies all serene and announcing noth-
ing doing in the way of a scrap

  it was indeed a mystery a whole seven-
day mystery during which time the train-
caller persisted in turning the other cheek to
the ticket-seller every time they met on each
of those seven days what on earth had
happened to the train-caller who before that
had always shown pugnacious tendencies but
who now meekly suffered all the slings and
arrows that the men flung at him from day
to day for seven days 

  on the eighth day however the secret
leaked out it was found that on the very
evening on which griffin had found the
ticket-seller smoking in the waiting-room he
stopped in at the railroad y m c a
walked into the secretarys office and said
mr secretary i heard a lecture in these
rooms some time ago in which the lecturer

he let out that long-delayed
punch


the railroad mans magazine

told that yarn about turning the other cheek
now my conscience is troubling me a whole
lot and i want your advice i have prom-
ised to punch a certain -fresh party to-mor-
row morning and what i want to know is-
shall  or shant i

not the storys end

  the horror-stricken secretary promptly
told the train-caller all about the wickedness
of fighting the result of the lecture was
that charlie griffin did turn the other cheek

  a novelist would end the tale here but i
as a railroad reporter am compelled to state
that on die day after the secret of his hu-
mility had leaked out the train-caller caught
the ticket-seller in the waiting-room again
with a cigar in his mouth this time with-
out further ado he let out that long-de-
layed punch and sent the ticket-seller to the
floor

  blount sprang forward to referee the duel
he counted ten and still the man lay help-
less

    mr blount said the train-caller  does
he look as if hed had enough  

winning a lawsuit

  yardmaster joe eager of the louisville
and nashville railroad at paris tennessee
sat in his office reading a newspaper when
suddenly he muttered

   hanged if i dont think i can win this
lawsuit for the railroad 

  he was alone in his office and no one was
within hearing but all the same he pound-
ed his fist on his desk and said

    say im jiggered if i dont win this suit
for the company ill take out an engine
and make the test if the engineer can stop
in time we lose if he cant stop in time we
win

  joe eager went over to an office labeled
attorneys-at-law and there had a long
talk with two men

  that same night a locomotive pulled out
of the roundhouse at paris and backed down
the track a piece where a caboose was coup-
led on

  in the cab was engineer bill murray and
a fireman in the caboose was conductor
chad petty joe eager and two men in long
blac-k coats who were not railroad men

   the little train sped along to a place just
south of mckenzie

  eager jumped off and called to the engi-
neer 

   all right murray back up a quarter
 of a mile so as to return past this spot at full

 speed

   the little train backed away and the
 yardmaster did what will seem a queer thing
 for a railroad man to do he lay down be-
 side the track with a leg across one of the
 ribbons of steel

   there was no moon that night but the en-
 gines headlight was the brightest the road
 owned the engine having backed up a
 quarter of a mile now came swooping to-
 ward the spot where the yardmaster lay the
 engineer blowing his whisde the moment he
 caught sight of the man on the track dien
 reversing and making every attempt to stop
 his train before reaching the man-but all in
 vain

   the yardmaster as the train drew near
 jumped up and scampered to a safe distance
 from the track-and the train flew past

    thatll do  cried eager as the train
 came back to pick him up  this test
 shows me that ill win that suit for the l
 and n and dont you forget it

   he jumped aboard the caboose and the
  train returned to paris

   the next day those who had gone out with
 the engine and caboose the night before in-
 cluding the two men in black coats ap-
 peared at the court-house where the case of
 mose lucas vs the louisville and nashville
 railroad was to come up for trial

   the lawyers representing the plaintiff
 stated their case they said that lucas had
 lost his leg by being run over by a train of
 the louisville and nashville railroad near
 mckenzie tennessee and wanted one thou-
 sand dollars damages

the lawyer speaks

   then up rose one of the men in black coats
 who had gone down to the spot near mc-
 kenzie the night before as one of the at-
 torneys for the railroad he addressed the
 court thus

   your honor and gentlemen of the jury
 paris tennessee in which this court sits is
 the division-end of the memphis-paris run
 of the railroad whose cause as defendant in
 this suit i now have the honor to plead in
 charge of the yards here is a yardmaster who
 from the first believed that the plaintiff was
 run over through no fault of engineer mur-
 ray who was at the throttle of the train which
 ran over the plaintiff the yardmaster to
 whom i refer is joseph eager whom i beg
 leave now to call as a witness
ten thousand miles by rail



 the yardmaster came to the stand and the
 attorney for the railroad said

 last night you took an engine down to
 the spot near mckenzie where the plaintiff
 was run over did you not  

  yes sir

 the headlight of that engine was the
 most powerful the railroad company pos-
 sesses was it not

 yes sir

 that engine was run by william mur-
 ray who was at the throttle when his train
 ran over the plaintiff was he not and in

judge gave it to the jury-a backwoods jury
-which filed out was gone about five min-
utes then returned and gave a verdict for
the plaintiff stating that he was entitled to
the damages claimed

  the result was that the l and n had to
pay mose lucas a thousand dollars

  two weeks later joe eager met engineer
bill murray and conductor chad petty when
those two pulled in on their train from mem-
phis said the yardmaster

   ill be hanged if ever i try again to win
a lawsuit for any railroad company know

t

the caboose behind the engine last night
was chadwick petty the conductor in charge
of the train that ran over the plaintiff 

    yes sir

  you mr yardmaster lay down on the
track in about the position in which the
plaintiff lay when struck did you not and
the engine then came down the track and
the moment the engineer saw you he tried
to stop the train but could not-is that not
so

    yes sir

  well then your honor and gentlemen of
the jury since it has been proven that the
engineer could not stop his train before run-
ning over the plaintiff and as the plaintiff
was lying where he had no business to be ly-
ing and as moreover the plaintiff was drunk
at the time of the accident-i now ask that
this case be quashed without taking up any
more of the time of this court

  instead of quashing the case however the

what i got for all my trouble got a repri-
mand to-day from headquarters for takin
out an engine without orders 

ten dollars for his heroism

  conductor lige combs of the coal and
coke railway with a run through west vir-
ginia is living proof that all the heroes
among railroad men are not on the trunk
lines

  combss road is only one hundred and
seventy miles long connecting the west vir-
ginia towns of charleston and elkins

  here is a new feat in child-saving per-
formed in a new way by conductor combs

  lige was very fond of children he ad-
mired particularly the little daughter of one
of the section-hands on his run who lived in
the section-house just out of leiter not far
from roaring creek

the section-mans name was exeline and

the engine came swooping toward the
spot where the yardmaster lav


the railroad mans magazine

his five-year-old daughters name was ingrid
exeline combs had often seen the little girl
and he pronounced her the sweetest little
thing on his run

  one day last january combss train pulled

by the back of the neck and threw him over
a fence

  on he rushed to where the child stood
off came combss uniform-coat and around
the little ingrid he threw it then rolled her
on the ground and with his bare hands beat
out the flames

the mother was absent at the time and
ingrid was all alone at the section-house

combs had to buy a new coat it cost
him ten dollars he told die boys of the
western maryland railroad at elkins where
it connects with the coal and coke railway
-and the western maryland boys in turn
told me at baltimore-that  it was worth
twice ten dollars just to see that pestiferous
dog wrigglin through the air while going
over that fence

the song of the lash

 ffrn 
 s  
      
      
 darnall actually did as the court ordered

away from lei ter on its way to roaring
creek and presently approached the section-
house where little ingrid lived

  looking toward the house in hope of
catching a glimpse of his little favorite
combs saw her standing in the door of the
section-house with her dress on fire

  the flames were threatening to envelop
her and combs heard her screaming in agony

  he pulled the cord signaling the engineer
to stop but he could not wait for the train
to come to a standstill the child would be
burned to death before he could get to her

  not another soul was anywhere in sight
to run to the little girls aid and although
the train was in motion combs rushed to the
steps of a car and jumped

  he rushed up to the section-house only to
be met by a dog that made for him combs
kicked the dog but fido came back at him
madder than ever combs seized the animal

to special officer darnall fell the duty of
     guarding property and preserving peace at
     the railroad station at mel-
     ville louisiana about a
     hundred miles out of new
     orleans the station being
     used jointly by the two
     roads entering the town
      the texas and pacific and
     the opelousas gulf and
     northeastern

       for months darnall had
worked overtime arresting
pesky hoboes who com-
mitted depredations on the
right-of-way of which he
was the guardian finally
he began offering up a daily prayer that some
one would invent devise or conceive some
form of punishment for the act of hoboism
that would cause tramps to avoid melville
louisiana one day his prayer was an-
swered

  it was on a sunday in february last
darnall soon after reporting at the railroad
station for duty saw smoke issuing from a
box car a little way up the track

   another human varmint he opined and
he girded up his loins and proceeded to stalk
the game

  suddenly looming up at the door of the
box car and peering in darnall saw a bo
sitting by a fire-a blazing pile on the wood-
en floor pointing his big gun at the man
he said

  kick out that fire and come with me

  half an hour later the special officer ar-
rived at the mayors house with his prisoner
ten thousand miles by rail



 yes sir

just then the cry from the oaks was re-
peated 

    whip-poor-wim whip-poor-wtk 
hanged if that bird aint right ex-
claimed the mayor ill do it darnall
youll take this will williams outside and
whip him give him forty lashes on the
back under the laws of the state of louis-
iana

   no no protested darnall i aint
hankerin for that job myself sir call over
the texas and pacific station-agent and let
him do it or call over that freight-handier
of the opelousas gulf and northeastern
they are huskies

   no insisted the mayor this crime
was committed on the property of both the
railroads the car belonged to the ope-
lousas gulf and northeastern but it was
standing on a track of the texas-pacific
now darnall you represent both roads and
i order you to administer forty lashes on
this will williams

darnall actually did as the court ordered

next month mr willets will tell you about a number of the daughters of the  grand army
of the rail south of the potomac under the heading some railroad girls in the dixie camps

  this one is the worst ive found yet
your honor said darnall  he was usin
the wood floor of a box car for a hearth
cant you think up some new kind of pun-
ishment for him your honor-some power-
ful sight harder punishment than you usual-
ly dish out

   whats your name   the mayor asked
  will williams

  youre fined four dollars

  aint got four dollars judge

  then youll have to work on the roads
no no said darnall that aint
punishment enough your honor

  what then do you want me to do with
him   asked the mayor

  just then through the open windows of
the mayors house came the cry from within
the near-by wilderness of live-oaks

    tffi-poor-will ifzi-poor-will 
hearing this cry of the bird of the air the
mayors eyes took an inspired expression
he meditated then said to the prisoner

  did you say your name was will will-
iams

race to gome in last

shasta limited crews unable to arrive late enough at sidings to avoid

throwing switches

under a new trackage agreement the shasta
limited runs from portland to seattle and
part of the way from vancouver to tacoma on the
northern pacific tracks

  in common with the northern pacific trains the
limited on this section of its run is operated under
what is known as the a p c block system as it
passes each station the engineer gets running orders
to the next station these being handed to him from
a  clip  by the station-agent

  these orders often contain instructions to pass a
certain northern pacific train at some siding out
in the country and railroad etiquette demands that
the crew of the trains first reaching a siding shall
get out and throw the switches at either end so
that the second train will not have to stop and if
there is anything the average passenger brakemkn
hates it is to get out unlock and throw switches
pass his train along throw the switch back again
and then chase up the track after the last car

 between portland and tacoma the shasta
limited is the crack train of the run it has the
fastest schedule and it averages over thirty miles
an hour for the entire trip northern pacific crews
have strict orders not to hold it up by being late at
passing points but the northern pacific engineers
know their road thoroughly and can calculate to a

nicety the length of time it will take the shasta
train to run from point to point

  the result is that the shasta limited always
reaches the sidings just a few seconds before the
northern pacific trains and the shasta crew has
to pile out regardless of weather and throw
switches as soon as this is done the northern pa-
cific train looms in sight rushes past on its clear
track and its engineer conductor and brakemen
lean out of the cab and vestibules and wave laugh-
ing greetings at the shasta men standing at the
switches

  the engineers of the oregon and washington
trains are doing their best to so time their arrival at
passing points as to force the northern pacific men
in first upon the sidings but so far they have not
succeeded with only a minute of leeway at pass-
ing points it requires a thorough knowledge of the
road and running conditions to lay back with-
out losing time and so the merry comedy has so
far been all one-sided

 the railroad eating-shack

by bessie bardsley

written for the railroad mans magazine

 v ake me way back to nevada where beside the gleaming track
j lull i i standing just next to the switch-head is the railroad eating-shack
 ll iillltlii us where the foot-hills cut the sky-line on the west and on the east
where the sunsets gorgeous rainbow gives the eyes an evening
feast

            while trailing down the canyon comes a sneaking little breeze
that cools your heated blood and brain and makes your fingers freeze

i want to see the boys again to know whos first out now

i want to hear the roundhouse men start up a friendly row

theres always something stirring there tween the hashers and the boss

the  shade of the temple  mormon boys and the prune-pickers up from los
i want to hear the same old joke-that everywhere else on the line
the towns are swell and the grub is good and the weather always fine

take me back to where the porter  hash-house willie beats the gong
while the train stops and the tourists rush inside a hungry throng-

i wouldnt mind the daily kicks bout the price of apple pie

or  beans fifteen cents and coffee ten its robbery  they cry

 what state is this nevada in  can hear some one ask

and  how soon do you think youll own this joint how long do
      you think youll last 

take me back to where the best double-discounts all the worst

where the west is wild and woolly as it used to be at first

mid the sage-brush in nevada where the foot-hills guard the track

where the indian builds his wigwam near the railroad eating-shack

       a woman wages a battle which
       is usually the end of all things

        chapter xix
        a womans battle

prskine who had already risen
regarded the young woman
h with an expression of bewilder-
ment mcgranes astonishment
held him to his seat miss
warrington raising higher the
veil that had partly concealed her features
turned to the irishman

   you may leave us she said curtly  i
should like a few words however with you
mr erskine

  mcgrane rose like a man in a dream re-
moved his hat and left the room he had
scarcely closed the door behind him how-
ever when it was opened by the porter of the
car who asked whether the ladies wished to
have their berths made up for the night

  louise shook her head no we shall not
require them she answered

  the porter went out and when the door
was closed again louise laying a hand on
her mothers arm led her to the seat that had
just been vacated by mcgrane on this the
two women sat down together mrs war-
rington sobbing quietly hid her face in her
handkerchief

   sit down mr erskine said louise

  the young man did so louise surveyed
him thoughtfully at length breaking the si-
lence she said

   mr erskine i have taken your advice
the young man nodded indeed he
exclaimed quietly

   yes i have telegraphed to my father
asking him whether anything serious has
happened to my brother joseph

  the young man flushed slightly then grew
more pale as he regarded her inquiringly

began la the march railroad mans



with nervous fingers louise opened the
chatelaine bag she carried and from it she
drew out a yellow telegraph-form

   this is the reply to my message went
on louise as she held the paper toward him

  erskine leaning forward took the message
from her extended hand and glanced it over
quickly it was addressed to miss warring-
ton at bernardville and read as follows

   joe disappeared two days ago if you cannot
   persuade him to return at once his disgrace is
   inevitable all who have chosen path other
   than mine must follow it expect no further
   communication from me

                                  father

  after carefully reading the message he
held the paper toward her she took it nerv-
ously

   you see it is about what i told you i
expected to receive she said weakly

  erskine looked at her more sharply her
manifest nervousness and the unsteadiness of
her voice plainly indicated that something
had weakened the proud uncompromising
spirit that had dominated her before

   you think the message was designed for
the purpose of causing you to return at once
to chicago he asked gravely

  yes

  erskine rose deliberately  then i have
nothing more to say he answered with a
bow of resignation

  stop the young woman exclaimed im-
patiently you are wrong there is some-
thing more to say

  fred resumed his seat and dropped his hat
beside him from without there came sev-
eral sharp shrieks of a locomotive whistle
followed almost immediately by a low rum-
bling sound the cascade flier was getting
under way

magazine- single copies  cents


the railroad mans magazine

  grasping the arm of her seat louise war-
rington leaned back and surveyed narrowly
the young man who sat facing her

   you still expect me to believe that ter-
rible story you told me several hours ago
she asked

  j all i told you was the truth miss war-
rington erskine answered quietly

   had it been true dont you think my
father would have spoken of it-in this
she asked slightly raising the telegram she
held

  gazing at the floor erskine frowned
thoughtfully  it is just possible that jour
father does not know he said

  an expression of incredulity settled on the
features of louise  he does not know  
she murmured

   it is possible that he does not said er-
skine and as he spoke he shifted his gaze
to the sobbing mother who sitting beside the
window still was holding a handkerchief to
her face

   you have told me that you saw the crime
committed the young woman went on  if
this were true did you not report the fact to
my father-or the police

  no i made no report of the matter to
any one my reason for failing to do this
was that i feared that mcgrane and i might
be detained as witnesses at a time when it
was essential we should be elsewhere than in
chicago

  you knew at that time that i purposed
leaving chicago

  no i have told you that i knew noth-
ing of your purpose in leaving chicago until
i saw you on the train at wapiti falls
true-true-i remember now sighed
the young woman wearily you told me
you were seeking-seeking some one else
yes

   atthe time you saw the crime committed
did you know that the mart you are seeking
now had any intention of coming west

   yes

   did you have any reason to suspect the
nature of his object in coming out here 
the face of erskine grew whiter as he
continued to regard his fair interrogator was
she honest in thus inviting his confidence or
was she working in the interest of montresor
for a moment he hesitated then giving her
the benefit of the doubt he spoke

   yes he answered slowly  i knew that
montresor was about to start for the state of
 ashington for the purpose of obtaining pos-
session of stolen property

  louise started violently and as with a

little cry she leaned toward him she clutched

the arm of her seat

   you mean-you mean-you know  she

gasped

   it was because i knew this that i left the
body of your brother on the lake shore in
chicago erskine replied for the dead
i could do nothing more but for the living
there was much to do and i came west to do
it immediately after the commission of the
crime the murderer and his companions es-
caped in a boat if it is true that the body
has not been found it probably is due to the
fact that the murderers succeeded in carry-
ing out their original plan and returning to
the shore carried the body out into the lake

  trembling violently and almost on the
verge of collapse louise sank slowly back
into her seat and regarded erskine with
dilated eyes her weeping mother appeared
to have heard nothing that had been said

   what was this stolen property of which
you speak   the young woman demanded
faintly after a pause

  and now it was erskines turn to hesi-
tate louise watched him with an expres-
sion in which curiosity and fear were
blended

   it consisted of certain bonds which it
was in the interest of your brother to have
returned to the place from which they were
taken the altoona man explained half-
reluctantly

  with a little gasp louise warrington
bowed her head and hid her face in her
hands erskines face was clearing now
there still was much in connection with the
young womans relations with the affair that
baffled him but he was gradually coming to
believe that in some manner or other she
had been moving in the dark

  straightening herself suddenly louise re-
moved her hands from her face and darted
a quick searching look toward erskine

   and it was to try to recover those bonds
and not to spy upon my movements that you
left chicago she asked

   the recovery of those bonds constitutes
my only object in coming west had i in-
tended to spy upon your movements i would
have followed you when you left the train at
bernardville

  you saw me leave the train

  yes mcgrane saw you also and it was
all i could do to prevent him from following
you his intention was not to spy upon you
however but to save you from the possible
influence of the man who had killed your
brother
without lights



     and you were willing that i- the
  young woman began and stopped

     had the situation not been so serious er-
  skine would have smiled at the sudden man-
  ifestation of feminine unreason but it was
  grimly enough that he answered

     my interest in you was secondary to the
  purpose of my mission i was not in a posi-
  tion to allow anything to divert me from my
  search for the bonds-and montresor
  leaning toward him louise laid a hand
  on his knee  and you think-think that
  you will be able to get the bonds-before
  they get into his hands again   she asked
  him breathlessly

      yes he answered curtly

    but how

     her voice was piteous and he was looking
  into a pair of beautiful pleading eyes for
  a moment his blood was tingling and his se-
  cret trembled on his lips but in a quiet calm
  voice he said

     i shall succeed miss warrington that
  is all i can tell you now

      but is it not possible that i can help
  you  

      i shall need no help

     a stricken look entered the young womans
  eyes  you-you do not trust me  she ex-
  claimed

    and erskine answered no

     with a little cry louise shrank from him
  and once more leaned back in her seat and
  hid her face in her hands in the attitude
  of this comparative stranger was a degree of
  self-mastery that she never had encountered
  in another man before even her father at
  times when he was most severe never had
  ventured to charge her with duplicity

     a flush of shame colored her cheeks then
  lowering her hands from her face she turned
  upon the young man a pair of eyes that were
  agleam with anger

     she pointed to the door

      go  she commanded in a low hoarse
  voice  it is only to my father that i will
  take that confidence which i was about to
  repose in you

 but erskine disregarding her command
  continued to study the angry womans face
  as louise looked into the young mans eyes
  she seemed to quail

      well-why do you not go   she asked
  breathlessly if you will not believe in
  me why do you not go  

    the anger that had been blazing in her
  eyes now gave place to an expression of re-
  proachful inquiry

     i am trying to believe in you miss war-
        rr

rington said erskine huskily  but you
forget that when-

  he stopped to the ears of both of them
came the sound of a locomotive-whistle and
they knew that the west coast express was
beginning to move in the direction that had
been taken by the cascade flier

   but if i tell you-

  there came a sudden thump at die state-
room door then the knob turned quickly and
the door flew open into the room rushed a
white-faced man with wildly gleaming eyes
in a moment he had closed the door behind
him

   miss warrington- he began in shaking
accents

  but he said no more his gaze had fallen
on the man who was seated opposite the young
woman to whom he had spoken he stif-
fened suddenly and recoiled aghast

  erskine rising faced montresor

       chapter xx
       the hour of destiny

hprembling and leaning against the
door montresor was the first to speak

  you he gasped looking at erskine
with dilated eyes

   yes erskine answered calmly  i
think we have met before

  slowly the englishman shifted his gaze
to the face of louise who with a little cry
had half risen from her seat her face was
pale and cold but in her eyes was gleaming a
light that chilled his blood and caused him
to quail before her

  for a moment the man half dazed seemed
to be on the point of attempting to retreat
he quickly altered his purpose however and
reaching behind him shifted the catch that
locked the door

  i want to speak with you alone he
said doggedly to louise

   i am under the protection of mr er-
skine sir and will hear nothing from you
that may not be said in his presence the
young woman answered in a voice that shook
a little

  montresor hesitating darted a malignant
glance in erskines direction then allowed
his gaze to fall to the floor

  what is it you wish to say to me asked
louise coldly

   one of your fathers agents has traced
us to this train the englishman replied
speaking with difficulty if he finds me
lie will place me under arrest if he does


the railroad mans magazine

this it will be impossible for me to keep the
promise that i made to you

  erskine turned to louise  what was the
nature of that promise miss warrington
he asked quietly

   he promised to return to me in tacoma
certain bonds on condition that i became his
wife she murmured

  erskine nodded grimly  he has made a
promise he cannot keep he said  more
than this he has just told you something
which i believe to be untrue i think i am
safe in saying that mr warrington has au-
thorized no one to place mr montresor un-
der arrest

  a gleam of hope suddenly lighted the face
of the englishman  is not glen streyer
an agent of mr warringtons  he demand-
ed eagerly

  and now it was erskines turn to start
he remembered that the general manager had
told him that glen streyer one of the most
efficient detectives in the united states was
working in the interest of stanwood the
treasurer of the company and that at all
hazards the missing bonds must be kept out
of his hands

  if streyer obtained the bonds the com-
plicity of joseph warrington in the theft
would be established and the end of andrew
warringtons career as a railway official
would be inevitable there was a faint ex-
pression of anxiety on erskines face there-
fore as he asked

    is glen streyer on this train  

  yes-yes he boarded it at tvrcone
montresor faltered

  once more the altoona mans heart was in
his throat if streyer had boarded the train
at tyrcone he doubtless had learned of the
hold-up of the cascade flier and that a type-
writer box had been taken from the dale
express car was it not probable that be-
fore leaving chicago the detective had a
clue that had caused him to follow this box
rather than montresor

  from the duty-bound engineer or the fire-
man he might have learned that the men
who had held up the cascade limited flier
had left the train at tyrcone in that event
it would be easy for him to infer that the
fugitives had planned to take the west coast
express at that point was it not more like-
ly that he was after the men whom he be-
lieved to have the box in their possession
than that he should have been diverted from
ids quest by the pursuit of montresor

  now it seemed to erskine that it was
himself rather than - montresor who had

most to fear from this redoubtable detective
who hadboatded the train in the stateroom
in which he now was standing were the suit-
cases containing the prize he had struggled
so determinedly to win

  whether glen streyer sought him or mon-
tresor the result was likely to be the same
montresors trail and his led to the state-
room in which now sat the sister of joseph
warrington the man who was suspected of
having taken the missing bonds from the
place in which they belonged and within
two feet of where louise warrington was
sitting were the missing bonds themselves

  appreciating the danger to which he would
be exposed by traveling with the bonds mon-
tresor had sent them by express and now
montresor miss warrington and the bonds
were in a small room together with the clev-
erest detective in the united states almost at
the very door

  in erskines mind there was little doubt
that the detective had been on the flier at the
time it was held up on the other side of the
dumbbell montresor had alighted at tyr-
cone and he probably was in a posidon to
tell whether or not the story of the robbery of
the express-car had reached the ears of the
other passengers or those of the men em-
ployed in and around the station but er-
skine dared not ask the question

  what is it then that you have come
here to ask of miss warrington   erskine
asked at length

  to conceal me here until i shall be able
to leave the train replied the desperate
man

  no-no gasped louise rising

  but-by heaven-ill stay the eng-
lishman muttered fiercely

  and as he spoke erskine saw the glint of
a revolver in his hand

  in a flash the altoona man had thrown
himself upon the unwelcome intruder to
and fro the strong men swayed but the un-
nerved fugitive soon yielded to erskines su-
perior strength after wrenching the revolver
from the hand of his adversary erskine
forced him to his knees

  the struggle ceased the shriek of fear
that had issued from the lips of mrs war-
rington had been smothered by the hand
which her daughter continued to hold over
her mouth

  erskine white-faced and grim leaned
lower over his adversary

  well montresor-are you done he
muttered

  the englishman struggled weakly then
without lights



liis chin sank upon his breast- for a mo-
ment the two men were motionless erskine
with his gaze resting on the bowed head of
the kneeling man was thinking quickly
louise and her mother were watching both
of diem with horror-stricken eyes

   and now there is nothing to prevent me
from delivering you into the custody of
streyer erskine said then after a pause
he added  but if you will do one thing i
will give you one more chance to run for it
and i will not follow you

  montresor looke up surlily erskine
went on

  yes i will let you go if in the presence
of diese ladies you tell me what you did with
the body of joseph warrington-after you
killed him

  still grasping the wrists of the beaten
man erskine felt him shudder an expres-
sion of great fear settled on his face and he
seemed to be on the verge of collapse

  speak erskine commanded roughly
which is it to be-confession or arrest

   if i tell you you will keep your word-
you will let me go  

  yes

  a long pause followed then montresor
said weakly  after you were gofie we took
it-took the body in a boat and sank it about
two hundred feet outside the breakwater
fred glanced toward louise who with
an arm around her mother was looking at
him with wide horrified eyes

  near what part of the breakwater
erskine asked

  the left side-going out replied mon-
tresor

   who was with you  

  the eyes of the vanquished man flashed
angrily  i have told you all i promised
to tell he said hoarsely  you gave me
your word that if i told you where we put
the body you would let me go

  erskine nodded and drew back  go
then he said

  montresor rose weakly to his feet  you
will not follow me he asked

  no i will not cause you to be followed
until to-morrow clear out

  the englishmans trembling fingers fum-
bled with die lock and knob then the door
opened and he passed out stealthily scarce-
ly had the door closed behind him when
with a little despairing cry mrs warrington
fell swooning to the seat from which she had
risen to the elder womans condition how-
ever the daughter gave no heed with a
look of bewilderment on her features she

stepped to erskine and laid a hand on one
of his arms

   why did you do this   she asked him
breathlessly  why did you let him go 

  half unconsciously he took her hand in
both of his  i let him go because it must
not be known that he was with us in this
room he said  i let him go because the
bonds we have been seeking are there and
streyer must not find them

  and as he spoke he nodded toward where
his two suit-cases stood where he had placed
them on the floor the expression of bewil-
derment on die features of louise grew
deeper following the direction of his
glance she gave a little start for the first
time since she had returned to the stateroom
she saw the cases of which he had spoken

  she turned to him again  you-you
mean that you have found them-the bonds
that-

   yes miss warrington i have found
them

  she looked at him incredulously at first
then the light of a great happiness overspread
her face a moment later she was in tears
and swaying slightly she turned from him

  erskine was about to speak when from
outside the stateroom door came the sound
of a loud hoarse cry which was immediately
followed by a revolver-shot into one of the
pockets of his coat he had dropped the re-
volver he had taken from montresor and his
fingers now closed around this as he glanced
in the direction of the door for several mo-
ments all was still then a second shot rang
in erskines ears and there suddenly flashed
across his mind the thought that the voice
was that of barney mcgrane

  quickly disengaging himself from the
grasp of the now terrified louise the younj
man rushed to the door and threw it open
the odor of gunpowder entered his nostrils
and from the car came the half-smothered
exclamations of the startled occupants of the
curtained berths

  moving forward cautiously erskine came
at last tothe vestibule there on one of the
platforms he saw the prostrate figure of a
man-motionless and with up-turned face-
a face he never had looked upon before
blood was flowing from a wound in the mid-
dle of the forehead and as lie looked er-
skine knew the man was dead

  who is he whispered a masculine
voice behind him

  erskine shook his head but he believed
lie knew deeper and deeper into his mind
sank the consciousness of the fact that the


the railroad mans magazine

lifeless form at his feet was none other than
the body of glen streyer the famous chicago
detective

  but erskine and the passengers whowere
now crowding in behind him had little time
to meditate upon the identity of the man who
lay before them all were startled by the
sound of a second shot which came to them
from the rear of the last car-another sleeper
-on the train

  as those around him shrank back erskine
pressed forward hurrying into the rear car
lie ran along the aisle once or twice he
came into collision with persons who in the
act of rising had allowed their heads or feet
to protrude from the sides of their berths but
he did not stop

  at last gripping his revolver he came to
the rear platform of the car it was empty
and the train was speeding at what he judged
to be a rate of fifty miles an hour

  for only a moment did the altoona man
hesitate a glance showed him that one of
the side doors was open this was sufficient
to tell the tale and with outstretched hand
he glanced up toward the bell-cord

  this was vibrating in a manner that plain-
ly showed that another hand was jerking at
it furiously the locomotive whistled there
was a hissing of air-pipes and a succession
of jolts and the train slowed down

  in the little party that accompanied the
conductor and a brakeman who jogged back
along the track was erskine he made no
attempt however to outdistance his compan-
ions for he reasoned that under the circum-
stances it would be unwise for him to expose
himself to the view of a dying man

  but by and by the conductor halted sud-
denly and the lanterns they carried hung
ominously over something they had found
beside the track advancing cautiously er-
skine saw two human figures lying together
they were men and one moving weakly
seemed to be trying to tighten his grip on
the collar of the other

  in the man who moved erskine recognized
his friend the irishman the man whose
twisted neck indicated that he yould never
move again of his own volition was mon-
tresor

   he done it the irishman was saying
weakly  he snatched a derringer from his
pocket and shot the other feller what told
liini he was wanted it aint the first man
he killed neither for-

  as the conductor bent lower over the
speaker the irishman coughing violently
made a vain attempt to rise erskine mov-

ing closer saw that his lips and chin were
flecked with blood

  hes dead aint he mcgrane asked
eagerly turning to the corpse that lay beside
him

   yes hes dead the conductor answered
gravely

  the irishman was about to speak again
when seeing erskine he motioned to him to
draw nearer

   is everything all right sir  he asked
as the altoona man knelt down beside him

   all right barney-if we can get you out
of this erskine replied in a shaking voice

  mcgrane shook his head  its no use
sir he said resignedly  i told you twerent
no use in prayin for the jumps to stop they
just kept cornin and a cornin till they got
me in the end but miss-miss warrington
dont believe that me and you did that thing
we was a talkin about does she sir 

  no barney the whole truth is known
to her now she understands

   i knew she would and now it looks as
though there werent no more for me to do
or say

   you must brace up barney while we
get you back to the car

   taint  use sir-taint no use im
goin somewheres faster than any car will
take me i aint got  more use for cars
and yet-yet theres still one more jump a
cornin to me im takin it now-just like
montresor did and if i land where he has
landed-begobs well have another set-to-
in the mornin

  and though death touched then the stout
heart that would beat no more it left intact
the last grim smile that had parted the lips
of barney mcgrane

       chapter xxi
       completing the task

hphree days after the death of montresor
and mcgrane frederick erskine
crouching behind a large packing-case that
was filled with pamphlets glanced impatient-
ly toward a skylight in the ceiling above him
each minute found the glass growing darker

  the altoona man was now in a storeroom
in the building in which the general offices of
the chicago st louis and western railway
company were located thither he had made
his way all unobserved more than five hours
before

  beside him were a dark lantern and two
packages wrapped in brown paper which
without lights

               n



 contained the bonds he had taken from his
 fathers train one of his thumbs thrust
 into a pocket of his vest touched a folded
 paper that lay within the paper was a leaf
 torn from the old testament book of prov-
 erbs

   many thoughts occupied the young mans
 mind as he crouched there alone for two
 days he had traveled eastward with louise
 and her mother and though all of them
 were moving solemnly in the shadow of a
 series of appalling tragedies there had been
 moments when the young man was conscious
 of sensations that were more pleasurable
 than any he ever had experienced before a
 beautiful young woman looking to him as
 her protector had given him a full measure
 of her confidence-a confidence that had an-
 nihilated all his darker doubts and fears

    it was a strange story that louise had told
 him but he believed it all it was at the
 home of one of the leaders of chicago society
  that she had first met charles montresor
 and it was explained to her that he was the
 son of a distinguished english nobleman

    despite his cleverness and other personal
 attractions however she had not been alto-
 gether favorably impressed by his manifest
 attempts to win her favor it was not until
 he became a close companion of her brother
 that she began to think better of him

   it was from montresor who posed as a
 man of wealth that she first had learned that
 her brother was in serious trouble prior to
 this montresor had twice proposed marriage
 to her but each time she had told him that
 she found it impossible to reciprocate his af-
 fection	j

   when however he told her that her
 brother whom she loved more than any one
 else in all the world was suspected of add-
 ing crime to his long list of indiscretions she
 flinging her own discretion to the winds had
 gone to mr stanwood the treasurer of the
 company and one of the enemies of her
 father for corroboration of the story stan-
 wood pitying her distress had told her only
 that certain bonds were missing from the
 office in which her brother was employed

    he had assured her however that joseph
 still was above suspicion but louise was
 not to be deceived suspecting that the sit-
 uation was more serious than stanwood had
 represented it to be she guardedly questioned
 her father concerning the missing bonds
 this had been the general managers ground
 for suspecting that she had obtained the in-
 formation from her brothers friend mon-
 tresor

  andrew warrington as the result of care-
ful inquiries concerning the young english-
man had learned that for some strange rea-
son he seemed to have no fixed place of
habitation and that he practically had been
disowned by his english relatives more
than this he was reputed to be a card sharp
and no longer found himself a welcome guest
at the chicago clubs which he had been wont
to frequent

  accordingly the old man had directed his
daughter to cut him from her list of ac-
quaintances this she would have been quite
willing to do had it not been for the fact that
she had begun to depend on montresor to aid
her in an attempt to shield joseph from the
disaster he had invited

  her mother who idolized her son was
louises only confidante knowing the in-
tolerance of her father for all forms of dis-
honesty she dared not reveal to him the
nature of her trouble such a revelation she
feared would result in the young man being
permanently ostracized from his family and
in the end disinherited

  the bonds of affection between mrs war-
rington and her children were so strong that
neither the mother nor daughter by letting
joseph know that he was suspected invited
his confidence in the matter they had
planned to save him without allowing him
to become aware of the fact that he had ex-
posed himself to the loss of their respect for
him

  to this end they encouragedhis friend-
ship for montresor whom they believed to
be acting in good faith as their representa-
tive in their efforts to have the bonds restored
to the place from which they had been taken
at length montresor had told louise that
he had obtained a clue to the missing bonds
and he offered to buy them for her through
one of his agents in tacoma

  overwhelmed by this evidence of the young
englishmans affection for her louise had
promised that if he should do this she would
become his wife in the meantime montresor
had told the mother and daughter that agents
of andrew warrington had begun to shadow
him night and day and that also as a friend
of her brothers he had fallen under suspi-
cion so far as complicity in the theft of the
bonds was concerned

  and so it had come to pass that when
erskine was introduced to her she had be-
lieved him to be nothing more than a detec-
tive hired by her father to spy on her move-
ments and to make trouble for montresor
she had seen the photograph of the english-


the railroad mans magazine

man given by her father to erskine and
fearing lest montresors arrest would prevent
him from setting out for tacoma on the mor-
row she had called him up on the telephone
and had informed him of what had taken
place

  he had sent to her the cab in which she
and the unsuspecting erskine had left the
warrington house and in accordance with
montresors instructions had gone to lincoln
park where it was understood the photo-
graph by which montresor was to be iden-
tified was to be taken from the man to whom
andrew warrington had given it

  how montresor came to be in possession
of the stolen bonds louise did not know
she had a theory however and erskine was
inclined to accept it montresor disowned
by his family was nothing more than a mere
fortune-seeker louise warrington was not
only one of the most beautiful women in
chicago society but her father was reputed
to be a millionaire

   attracted therefore no less by her finan-
cial prospects than by her personal qualities
the dashing young soldier of fortune was de-
termined to make her his wife to this end
he succeeded in getting her brother in his
power

   whether the bonds were taken on josephs
initiative or as a result of the influence which
montresor exercised over him was a matter
for speculation one thing was certain how-
ever the bonds speedily found their way into
montresors possession-probably as a result
of die englishmans promise to raise money
on them secretly-a sum sufficient to enable
joseph to continue his reckless course of
speculation

   though it was certain that montresor had
at least two confederates who were more or
less informed concerning his relations witli
joseph warrington and the stolen bonds
these men being involved in the murder of
die son of andrew warrington were scarcely
likely to speak of the affair to any one the
lips of montresor were sealed forever but
before his death he had succeeded in taking
the life of glen streyer the only man outside
the conspiracy who had appeared to have
learned the truth

  barney mcgrane attracted by the sound
of the shot that had killed streyer had start-
ed in pursuit of the englishman and had
grappled with him until both had fallen from
the train and thus the only person who was
informed concerning all of erskines move-
ments on the night the cascade flier was
held up was also silenced

  the only persons who now were in pos-
session of facts that were likely to result in
serious trouble for erskine or a revelation of
the taking of stolen property from the dale
express-car were the young mans father and
the fireman it was the course that was to
be pursued by his own father that now gave
erskine the greatest concern

   at the time that the cascade flier had
stopped at tyrcone he had believed that his
fathers affection had triumphed over his
sense of duty it was louise who undeceived
him

   louise had boarded the flier at bernard-
ville and it was at her request that the con-
ductor who knew her and her mother to be
the daughter and wife of the general mana-
ger of the c s l and w had directed the
engineer to stop at tyrcone in order that she
might again take possession of her state-
room on the west coast express there being
no unoccupied staterooms or berths on the
flier

   in reflecting on the conduct of his father
the young man now realized that by repre-
senting that the first stop of the train would
be at weatherbee the engineer had been try-
ing to coerce his son into returning to the
baggage-car the property which he had ta-
ken from it the only comfort the young
man found in his review of the adventure lay
in the fact that his father appeared not to
have reported that he had seen the unmasked
faces of the men who had held up his train

   neither did it appear that the fireman had
spoken the newspapers of nearly all the
big cities in the united states printed ac-
counts of the hold-up however but in view
of the fact that only a typewriting machine
appeared to have been taken the theory was
expressed that the hold-up had been the re-
sult of a wager

  while it was known that montresor had
killed glen streyer in order to escape arrest
the precise nature of the englishmans of-
fense remained a mystery mcgrane was re-
ported to be the family coachman of the
warringtons who was accompanying mrs
warrington on a trip they had been taking
to the west and who upon seeing streyer
shot down had sacrificed his life in an at-
tempt to prevent the escape of the assassin

   in the presence of louise and her mother
erskine had compelled montresor to confess
that he had sunk the body of joseph war-
rington in lake michigan just outside the
breakwater at chicago while this confes-
sion had been sufficient to convince the two
women that the altoona man had spoken the
without lights



truth circumstances proved that it was un-
necessary so far as the recovery of the mur-
dered mans body was concerned

   at the time the confession was made the
waters of the lake already had given up their
dead and now the young mans body was in
its tomb the body of honest barney mc-
grane now on its way from the west would
be buried on the morrow

   darker and darker grew the skylight un-
der which the young man lay awaiting the
hour which should witness the completion of
the formidable task which only six days be-
fore he had undertaken

   since his return to chicago he had made
no attempt to see or communicate with an-
drew warrington and from louise he had
exacted a promise that until his work was
done she would not reveal to her father the
fact that she had met him in the west she
had kept that promise

   the afflicted father knowing that louise
and her mother had been on the train from
which montresor had fallen with mcgrane
doubted not that his daughter accompanied
by her mother had gone west to wed the
man against whom he had warned her but
satisfied that all was over he asked no ques-
tions he had folded her in his rms then
he had led her to the room in which lay his
murdered son

   it was after midnight when erskine rising
from behind the box in the storeroom stealth-
ily began to make his way in the direction of
the office in which the treasurers big safe
was located concealed under a desk in an-
other apartment he waited until the watch-
man made his hourly round then he entered
the treasurers office

   screened by a cloth which he had carried
with him he turned the light of his dark
lantern on die lock of the vault-door then
carefully but with a slightly shaking hand
he turned backward and forward the knob
that controlled the indicator which pointed
to the numerals and letter on the dial and
as he worked he- seemed to hear the dying
voice of joseph warrington repeating thfe
figures and words

   the indicator had pointed to the numerals
 when erskine paused and unfolded
the page he had carried in the pocket of his
vest and for the last time he studied the
last two verses of the fifth chapter of the
book of proverbs then with the indicator
he spelled out the words on the little dial

   his own iniquities shall take the wicked
himself and he shall be holden with the cords
of his sins

      he shall die without instruction and in the
   greatness of his folly he shall go astray

   this done he turned the indicator to the
numerals  with a rapidly beating
heart erskine now attempted to draw to-
ward him the great steel door of the vault
i it moved

the lost bonds

qt the morning of the day following er-
skines visit to the vault andrew war-
rington sitting alone in the library of his
residence was approached by his butler who
timidly informed him that a visitor had
called to see him the general manager
looking at the servant vacantly failed to
catch the name

   who is it he asked irritably

  a man who says his name is erskine
sir the butler answered

  the general manager started slightly
frowned and nervously tapped on the amis
of his chair after a moments hesitation he
said surlily

   well bring him in

   when the servant left the room andrew
warrington leaning forward hid his face in
his hands the whole world was dark to
him now and he felt that he sat alone with
dishonor

   scarcely had fred erskine left his office
on the week before when the general mana-
ger realized that he had been guilty of an act
of folly in asking him to undertake such a
formidable quest he had acted only on the
inspiration of the moment and had allowed
himself to be too greatly influenced by the
self-reliant aspect of this son of his old
friend

  when erskines note had informed him
that the young man had been attacked and
overcome by the man whom he had been in-
structed to watch he sent him another thou-
sand dollars but he had not the slightest
hope that anything of a favorable nature
would result from the quest since then er-
skine had seldom entered his thoughts

   now when the butler announced the name
of the visitor the broken-spirited old man
resolved that he would take advantage of
this opportunity to bid the young altoona
man to cease his efforts financial as well
as official ruin stared him in the face and
he knew that his career was done

so absorbed was he in painful reveries


the railroad marts magazine

that he did not hear the visitor enter the
room at length however a hand falling
on his shoulder put his thoughts to flight
and as he turned his head he heard a voice

   im sorrv andv-sorry that you lost the
lad

  and a moment later his hand was in the
horny grasp of sam erskine the old en-
gineer

  oh sam it- you warrington ex-
claimed rising and shaking the hand of his
old friend

   yes andy the other answered with a
sigh  its me and i know this aint a
time for words i aint a goin to stay long

i was in chicago and just dropped in i
knew youd know how sorry id be when i
heard youd lost your boy it wasnt neces-
sary for me to come here to tell you that
but-but-

  the old man hesitated and looked
thoughtfully toward one of the windows

 sam sighed warrington  youre looking
old

  the engineer nodded  yes andy and
im feelin older than i look thats why
im goin to send in my resignation to-day

  the general manager looked at him sharp-
ly youre going to resign no no sam
its not as bad as that i hope you are not
so old that you are not good for many a
long run yet

   im out of the runnin now andy-all
out of it now the old man replied in a
choking voice

  warrington laid a hand on the old mans
arm

   whats the trouble sam   he asked-
looking at the other anxiously

  weve all got our troubles old friend

i suppose the engineer replied then his
voice broke and sobbing like a child he
added but-but-god pitv me ive lost
my boy 

  warrington led him to a chair and urged
him to sit down

   youve lost your boy  he repeated in-
credulously  no no you must not tell
me that

   hes not dead andy-it is worse than
that three nights ago with a black mask
on his face he held up my train just this
side of the dumbbell out in washington 

  the general manager recoiling a step
looked at him with an expression of amaze-
ment

   three nights ago-out in washington
he muttered

   yes

  but why

   he told me when we recognized each
other-

  you are sure it was fred

  yes andy-it was fred-my boy he
was with me for an hour

  warringtons face grew livid it was in
the state of washington that montresor
had come to his death it was from wash-
ington that louise and her mother had just
returned

   but why-in gods name why war-
rington demanded impatiently and as he
spoke perspiration began to gather on his
forehead

   he told me that what he took from the
express - car was stolen property - that -
that he was to return it to the rightful own-
er but-

  did he get it-get away-with it the
general manager asked breathlessly grip-
ping the arm of the engineer

  sam erskine looked at him wonderingly

   yes he said  i run the signal of my
conscience and let him get away from me at
tyrcone and that andy is why ill never
lay my hand on a throttle again

   tyrcone 

  andrew warrington was trembling like a
leaf in the wind it was just beyond tyr-
cone that montresor had fallen from the
train was it possible that after all-

  once more the butler crossed the threshold
coughed slightly and approached his master
 another mr -erskine sir the man ex-
plained and as he spoke he held out a
card

  the general manager took the card ab-
stractedly the words of the butler had
failed to reach his ears then suddenly
he became conscious of the fact that the
name that was dancing before his eyes was
mr -frederick erskine

  he turned his livid face to the butler but
he could not speak he nodded and the
servant left him leaning on the top of a
chair he watched the door through which
the servant left the room

  in a few moments fred erskine walking
quickly appeared in the doorway some-
thing distracted the young mans attention
and he turned and smilingly addressed some
one in the hall

  with an exclamation of astonishment the
old engineer rose quickly and tottered for-
ward from the hall there came a little
joyous cry and immediately afterward
louise gowned in black rushed to the stal-
wart man who stood upon the threshold
without lights



and placing her hands upon his shoulders
fell sobbing on his bosom as erskine
slipped an arm around her waist his face
was shining

  turning to where warrington with a
corpse-like face was standing he said qui-
etly

   they are in the vault sir and no onev-
will know who put them there

  and then he saw his father

  breathing heavily warrington with dry
lips addressed the young man at the door

  you-you mean that you placed them
there yourself-without aid from others 
he asked in a cracked and husky voice

   yes the young man answered gravely
  when

  at midnight

   but-but how-how-

   i got the combination from the lips of
a dying man who was more sinned against
perhaps than sinning-a man who came to
his death at the hands of montresor and
whose body was afterward sunk in the lake
as the chin of andrew warrington sank
upon his breast sam erskine clutched his
arm the old engineer was looking out to-
ward the doorway with wide wondering
eyes

  andy-andy he gasped is that
your girl  

  slowly raising his head the general man-
ager saw them-fred erskine and louise
they were standing side by side and hold-
ing hands the general manager nodded

   yes sam shes mine and would to god
the boy who stands beside her was her
brother he answered solemnly  but
though he is your son he must be mine as
well he must take the place of the boy that
i have lost

  again the old engineer clutched the speak-
ers sleeve

   but andy you-you forget what i was
tellin you when he came in sam erskine
protested in quavering accents  you for-
get i told you that out in washington-
no sam i dont forget the general
manager answered wearily  but i have
learned enough to know that somewhere out
in the state of washington your son was
the champion of the honor of my family and
that he won his fight

   if he wore a black mask  the night
you saw him in your cab he wore it hon-
estly and in my interest rather than his
own and you old friend must have a
care this old world of ours plays strange

the

tricks on us sometimes and a father should
beware lest he misjudge his son

  you know then- the engineer began

  warrington slipped an arm around his
old friends shoulders  yes andy i know
that your son so far from being guilty of
any wrongdoing was acting the part of a
hero on the night that you mistook him for
a bandit he said  i know much that
never will be made clear to you and yet as
things are going now there is much that i
still fail to understand

  all will be explained to me i know but
until that explanation comes i will suspect
that it is partly by the efforts of your son
that i have regained the daughter whom i
feared was lost

  within an hour he had the explanation
from the lips of louise who told him of the
sacrifice she had meditated in order to save
the honor of the family name while she
was telling him her story her father lovingly
caressed her hands but when she spoke of
the part that fred erskine had played in
the affair the light that illumined her eyes
brought to the old mans lips the first smile
that hadrested there for many days

  louise saw the smile and her face grew
crimson her father however nodded con-
tentedly and stroked her hair

   it is well louise he said reassuringly
you like him i would have it so

  and so it came to pass that the story of
the lost bonds was never told how the
bonds were taken and by whom the few
persons who were aware of their disappear-
ance never knew to president burbridge
stanwood the treasurer reported that they
were found and the information was con-
veyed by burbridge himself to the general
manager

  owing to the death of joseph warring-
ton several days before it was known that
he could not have returned them and yet
the secret of the combination of the vault
was supposed to be in the possession only of
stanwood and young warrington the com-
bination was altered without delay but the
manner in which the bonds had been re-
stored always remained a mystery

  warrington succeeded burbridge as presi-
dent of the road and shortly after his ele-
vation to this office the engagement of
louise to the assistant superintendent of
motive power of the road was announced

  the assistant superintendent of motive
power was frederick erskine

 to pull out of the yards on time to the second
 theres not a flat or a gondola in the whole train

   did you ever stop to realize that only a short



 while ago a wave of popularity for the narrow-gage

to fight fires

secretary wilson has recently signed a
memorandum of agreement with the great
northern railway company and also one with the
northern pacific railway company which pro-
vides for cooperation of the forest service and the
railroads to prevent damage to the national forests
from fires along all lines operated by these rail-
roads these agreements had already been signed
by r i farrington vice-president of the great
northern and howard elliott president of the


the railroad mans magazine

northern pacific so that they are by the signature
of the secretary of agriculture now in force

  the companies agree to clear and keep clear of
inflammable material a strip of varying width as
conditions may demand up to two hundred feet
beyond the right-of-way and to provide all locomo-
tives which do not burn oil with suitable spark
arresters and other standard equipment to prevent
the dropping of fire the protective strip is to be
designated jointly by representatives of the railroad
and the forest service

  in fighting fires the railroads and the forest serv-
ice will cooperate closely prompt notification to
forest officers of all fires discovered by employees
of the railroads is provided for telephone lines
to make this possible will be put up by the forest
service using the companies poles where this is
desirable warning whistles will be sounded by
locomotives on occasion

  forces of fire-fighters will be assembled on the
outbreak of fires made up of forest officers rail-
road employees and such temporary labor as can
be gathered by either except for salaries of regu-
lar employees the cost of fighting fires which start
within two hundred feet of the railroads will be
borne by the companies and all others by the forest
service unless it shall be shown in the first case that
the railroads were not responsible or in the second
case that they were responsible for the outbreak of
the fire

  the agreement provides that the forest service
will regularly patrol the rights-of-way during the
fire season the work of clearing the strips satis-
factorily including disposal of all slash and refuse
is to be performed by the railroads under the super-
vision of the forest service

  since the courts have sustained the right of the
department of agriculture to collect damages from
railroads running through national forests for fires
which they cause there is in this fact a strong in-
ducement for railroad companies to join with the
department in the effort to keep fires down but
other reasons are doubtless potent and perhaps the
most potent ones in favor of this agreement

  the northern pacific being a land-grant rail-
road owns a great amount of timber on the alter-
nate sections along its line the great northern al-
though it is not a land-grant road also has property
at stake in its buildings and the line itself opera-
tion of which may be seriously interfered with by
forest conflagrations the value of heavy timber
in mountainous regions as a deterrent to ava-
lanches landslides and floods is also to be con-
sidered but from the standpoint of a far-sighted
business policy a still broader argument is the rela-
tion of the forests to the general welfare of the
regions whose traffic the railroads handle



mr youngs work-report

we have always wanted to print the poem
known as engine  and are indebted
to the author mr charles s young of wynne
arkansas for the copy which is appended

this poem is die copy of a work-report turned in

by mr young at helena arkansas some years ago

when he was an engineer of the i m and s of
course he was disciplined by the m m but all that
is past and a matter of history and we are mighty
glad to have this opportunity to add mr youngs
poem to the many remarkable railroad documents
in verse which have made such pleasant reading in
the carpet

  engine 

mr foreman i herewith hand you a report

the only one really of its kind or sort

on the famous engine 

in condition about the worst ever seen

she is one of these faithful kind as you well know-
but tis a shame the way the pistons blow

wash out the boiler bore out the flues

of course this clause to you is not news

the flues are squirting caulk all the leaks
driving-boxes- all so dry they squeak

steam-pipes leaking pack throttle well

both main pins cut and run hotter than-

all rod bushings loose on both sides

set up the wedges line up the guides

air-pump jerks on both strokes

examine the valves and see if they are broke

take down the main rods reduce the brass

above all be sure to put in a water-glass

raise the draft-sheet a notch or more

fix the latch on the fire-box door

     

i think from the way she cuts her lire

the petticoat pipe should be a little higher

the lagging all gone off the boiler-head

actually it would roast a being alive or dead

clean out the lubricator-neither side will feed-

i think from the condition a new one she needs
clean the brake-valve shorten the brake rods

for when you want to stop just trust in god

when on her i step to take my place-

although nervy im claimed fear is shown on my
      face-

for just one look at her a history is known

for the effects of many a hard trip is shown

nervous men should never ride this gine

for every move they would think it their time

for the cab is really a traveling trapeze

one cannot ride in it and feel at ease

springs all broken engine riding on frame

really of this eng the company is ashamed

what else is to be repaired i shall not say

for what is reported will not be done for many
      a day

i have been with her for the past ten days

of handling an engine without brakes ive learned
       many ways

when i took her i was both young and gay-

now my nerves are shattered and im almost gray

for every move i make with her i expect a rod
to fly off and put my soul in the hands of god

to see while working steam is out of the question

i guess tis good for me i believe in predestination
on the editorial carpet



so take pity on a being with a conscience and a
       heart

send a man to relieve me for i was all in from
       the start

regards to yourself engine and crew

if you will give me a pass home ill skidoo

sky-rocket red

sorry we cant help

on several occasions that we are not in a
position to offer advice to those seeking railroad
jobs nevertheless we are constantly in receipt of
letters of which the following is a good example

editor the railroad mans magazine

  on what road would you advise a young man to
start firing and get steady work-h g w

  we would be very glad to furnish information of
this character to applicants for positions but un-
fortunately we are absolutely tillable to do so as
success in railroading as well as in any other field
depends solely on the thoroughness application and
reliability of the man in question we can only ad-
vise h g w and the scores of others who have
written us that they will very likely have no trouble
securing and holding a job on any railroad if they
cultivate these very desirable qualities

  as for going further to tell him what railroad
would be the best to apply to we must ask our read-
ers to be merciful to us in this respect as our time is
taken up with editing a magazine rather than run-
ning an employment agency and we are unable to
keep in touch with questions of this sort there-
fore we must again say to those who write to us
inquiring what roads need firemen brakemen and
other employees not to seek our advice as we will
be unable to be of assistance

  we recently received a letter in which the writer
said  i have been running a donkey-engine for six
years and would like to know where i can get a
position to run a locomotive i am fully able we
replied in our most courteous manner that we
doubted if our correspondent were capable and told
him something of the requirements of running a
locomotive his reply was

  you dont know what i can do you ought to
be painting a house

  may be who knows

would pay fifty cents a copy

the following letter is from an old railroad man
down in louisiana it is the kind that we
like to receive and ve wish that more of you boys
would get down off the box-seat now and then and
throw a few coals in our fire-box can any of you
send in the complete words of the song for which our
friend asks we would like to publish them

editor the railroad mans magazine

  in the june number of the railroad maxs
magazinei came across an article heraldry of

the railroads giving the history of the northern
pacific emblem i have been in the engine service
of the n p and always understood that the n p
emblem represented two whales

 i also want to go after mr robert h rogers
 in his the roundhouse foreman i think old
 pete yeager put one over on the old man when he
 got him to put a piece of gas-pipe in the smoke-
 stack to split the fog i have had the same thing
 done on soft-coal engines only i used a bolt for
 the same purpose and got results i- have also had
 what they call a bridge inserted in the nozzle on
 single-exhaust nozzle engines i have also stuck
 the plugging-bar down the smoke-stack and into the
 nozzle when an engine would blow the bridge out
 this was on the old-style nozzle engines but the
 article on the roundhouse foreman was o k
 that gentleman does have a few troubles of his
 own

 i have been reading the railroad mans maga-
 zine for years now it seems and pay fifteen cents
 a copy for it i have to get it from the butchers on
 the passenger-train in this neck of the woods but
 i would pay fifty cents a copy before i would miss
 one number

 i am going to ask for the remainder of a song i
 do not know the title of it but one verse of it runs

      always together in sunshine or rain

      always together on top of the train

           away oer the meadows

            along neath the stars

      were always together on top of the cars

      another old song

 so many of our readers have asked for the
 words of the montreal express that we
 are more than glad to be able to present them in full
 in this number the correct name of the old
 poem is

song of the vermont disaster

 in our country far and near each day we read or
      hear

 of shocking accidents on land or sea 

 your attention now ill call to the latest of them
      all-

 the central vermont railway tragedy

 it was the montreal express it was speeding at its
      best

 when near the woodstock bridge it struck a
     broken rail

 and with a fearful crash down the dark abyss it
      dashed

 and few survived to tell the awful tale

 twas in the dead of night no one can paint that
      sight

 sleeping-cars were filled with living freight

 this ill-fated train was dashed to the river with a
      crash

and a hundred souls went down to meet their fate

 the wreck was soon ablaze horror met the victims
      gaze

 and their frantic cries for help were sad to hear
 none responded to their call they must have per-
 ished one and all

 alas kind friend no help for them was near


the railroad mans magazine

tis shocking to relate tis sad to contemplate

  no one can paint a picture of that sight

little they dreamed that death was nigh when they
      bade their friends good-by

  ere leaving home upon that fatal night

there is one wholl not forget that is little joe
      megrett

  who was with his father on that fatal train
though wounded by his fall when he heard his
fathers call

  to free him from the wreck he tried in vain

 tis no use my boy said he  there is no help
       for me

  and then the burning flames around him curled
little joe began to cry when his father said
 good-by

  we will meet again up in another world

wages advance 

the railway wage advances already made or to
be made before the end of the year are now
estimated at  for the entire country
this is the figure given by president brown of the
new york central it includes of course many
advances the details of which have not yet been
settled

  calculated on the interstate commerce commis-
sion statistics as a basis the wages paid to railway
employees under the new scale will amount to
 a year this is arrived at by esti-
mating the operating expenses of the present fiscal
year from the monthly reports now available ap-
plying the percentageiof labor cost to total operating
expenses in  the latest year for which wage
figures have been published and adding the -
 estimated advance in wages this year

  the  which it is estimated will
be paid out to employees annually under the new
scale compares with  in the fiscal
year  the year which holds the record for the
volume of railway business

  wages on the railroads were not reduced after
the  panic so that this years advances are oji
top of those which were made in  and the
early part of  the proportion of labor cost
to total operating expenses has increased steadily
for several years

 help to save the old songs

heres another call for songs boys all the old
ones you can remember songs of the rail
or any other variety you mayhave come across but
particularly the ones that you have heard but never
seen in print wouldnt it be a shame if all the
good old songs that have sprufig from the hearts of
our fathers and contain so much of the spirit of
the pioneers and the civilizing romance of a new
continent should be lost and forgotten

  this is the way they feel about it at harvard
university and john a lomax associate professor
of english in the agricultural and mechanical col-
lege of texas has asked us to help him in his work

of collecting and preserving american ballads and
folk-songs which he is carrying on as a sheldon
fellow of harvard university

professor lomax hopes that a number of the read-
ers of the railroad mans magazine will be
interested enough in the preservation of the old
folk-songs to write out whatever verses they may
remember and mail them to him at college station
texas he will be very grateful for all contribu-
tions and will see that they are carefully preserved
and published

	willing to steal it

editor the railroad mans magazine

i am a constant reader of the railroad mans
magazine i have run across a little mistake
which i think is out of reason i have han-
dled some railroad material myself and never saw
a keg of bolts for use in connecting rails together
that would weigh one ton under the head of
 whats in a railroad  in the june number you
say  twelve kegs of bolts weigh twelve tons this
is not a kick on the magazine understand but i
have been wanting to write to you for some time to
let you know that somebody in this town is alive

i remember one story you had about railroad
thieves working in and out of st joseph and i
happen to know that thst is true i started reading
the railroad mans magazine before i worked
on a railroad and i think i will read it as long as
i can buy borrow or steal it

speed

to i s fish kill landing new york we send
our thanks for this old poem its a bit out-
of-date now but may be one of our many railroad
poets can write something that will describe modern
speed quite as well

twenty minutes late

     the twain at last have struck their gait-

     the engine and the engineer

 the train is twenty minutes late 

the smutty fireman gives a cheer

     he lets her out in giant strides

     she thrusts her slender arms of steel
     deep in the caskets at her sides

     the nervous creature seems to feel
     for something precious hidden there

     plucks out great handfuls of the power
     that gives her sixty miles an hour

     and flings and tosses everywhere
     great volumes of the power asleep

     as if a million fleecy sheep
     turned out to pasture in the air

with glittering elbows ceaseless play

she brightens night and darkens day

      she buckles bully to the work

     shes not the kind of girl to shirk

     the driver says and tries die gage

     and never dreams he leads the age

     full seventy feet at a single plunge

and seventy feet at a single breath

     and seventy feet from instant death 

     a little slower than the lunge
on the editorial carpet



        the lightning makes that stabs the night
        and faster than a falcons flight

      tis seventy feet at every beat
        of heart and clock die train is hurled

      at such a rate with such a mate

       not eighteen days around the world

     a seventy-mile stretch

editor the railroad mans magazine

int the june issue pf the railroad mans maga-
zine light of the lantern department you
mention quite a number of long stretches of
straight track but as there is no mention of the
track from dalhart texas to guymon oklahoma-
a distance of seventy miles straight track on the
rock island lines-i thought i would call your at-
tention to it i am employed at this division point
of the rock island as a locomotive engineer the
country is a rolling one but there is one place where
you can see an electric headlight a distance of about
thirty-five miles i am a constant reader of your
magazine and enjoy it very much and think it fills
the bill-c s e dalhart texas

jt

     that is our belief too

editor the railroad mans magazine

icc reading your june issue i find a very interest-
ing article headed with the veterans on the
erie i am interested in the article because many
of the old-timers spoken of are well and kindly re-
membered by me and it takes me back to the days
when i loo was one of the old eries men

   but there is one part of your article to which i
take exception and that is where you refer to the
late superintendent e o hill as the fighting
superintendent this is misleading there never
lived a more kind-hearted sympathetic man than
e o hill file was a strict disciplinarian-and
where will you find a successful man of large af-
fairs who is not-but as a fighter no except as
for the rights of humanity

  his motto was like davy crocketts  be sure
youre right then go ahead

  he beiieved that the old men were better and
more capable than new men few men were dis-
charged by him and after sufficient time had
elapsed for proper discipline they were taken back

 they then- proved by their faithful service that the
 judgment of superintendent hill was correct

   inquiry among the old-timers will bring out many
 cases which will bear out my assertion that no
 man was ever held in greater respect by the men
 under his command or who had greater sympathy
 for them in their misfortunes

    i speak feelingly in this matter for the reason that
 e o hill was my father and a more kind and
 indulgent parent never lived he was a silent man
 having little to say and that to the point but the
 kindliness of his motives were neverquestioned

where  is used

 editor the railroad mans magazine

 in your june number a b k clinton iowa
 asks  are there any roads that use    orders
 altogether with some additional safeguards
 you answer that you dont know of any i wish
 to say that i have worked here on the utah division
 of the u p as brakeman since the middle of
 march and in that time i have seen but one 
 order they have a schedule  order but with
 the one exception i have spoken of the 
 is invariably crossed out and  substituted

   the u p as you probably know is protected on
 its main line by automatic block signals on both
 single and double track

    if this is any value to a b k he is welcome to
 the information

mallets on the n p

 editor the railroad mans magazine

 in your reply to question of  g h miles city
 montana on page  june issue of the
 railroad mans magazine you state that your
 records do not indicate any mallet compound loco-
 motives on the northern pacific railroad

   two or three years ago the baldwin locomotive
 works built sixteen locomotives for the northern
 pacific railway which are practically duplicates of
 the large mallet engines in use on the great north-
 ern railway these northern pacific engines
 weigh  pounds in working order with -
  pounds on driving-wheels and with eight-thou-
 sand-gallon tenders weigh two hundred and fifty
 tons

   i am unable to say as to whether or not any ad-
 ditional locomotives of this type have been built for
 the above-mentioned road-c d w east cleve-

from an old-timer

 editor the railroad mans magazine

 if you could i would like you to publish some-
 thing about the early days of the rock island
 on the illinois division i was there when they
 had the old link-and-pin and there were no air-
 brakes among the men of those days were theo-
 dore milar s gifford buffalo bill jim lucas and
 rock island pat on the right-hand side of the
 cab were daddy hamilton janies george a dick-


the railroad mans magazine

erson and many others i cannot recall at present
in those days they had a number of engines some
good for twelve or fifteen loads

two of these engines were silver-mounted bell
and all and they were the pride of mr cable and
his able assistants there was no double track in
those days rock island was the end of the road
and some people thought the end of the world
the split-switch was not thought of and it was
necessary at times to take the coal-pick and pound
the ends of the rails over to make a siding

                   old-timer denison texas

saw no 

editor the railroad mans magazine

some time ago you published an article from one
of your contributors mentioning the fact that he had
been looking for a car with the numbers running
from one to five but had failed since then  have
watched to see how soon i could spot one to-
day may   at  pm in savannah

death on the rail or mccarthys
last ride

one of the old poems for which we have had many
requests

 atid lle elte booming of thunder

    ivj sharp lightning and deluge of rain
    came the tidings of death and disaster
    to carltons ill-fated train

where the winds sudden raise in its fury
    soon blew in a merciless gale

and sent flying along from the siding
    a car to spread death on the rail

twas a night when bravest might falter

    with heart-stricken fear and despair

for it seemed as if legions of demons
    were out and at war with the air

but the tide of humanity flowing
oercame every feeling of fright

in the rescuing party who labored
so bravely that terrible night

 a sight that will neer be forgotten
    while reason presides in the brain

to behold all the dead and the dying
    who rode on that ill-fated train

 heaven pity them all heres one other
 whose equals on earth were but few
 hes my noble professional brother

 who proved what a brave man can do

 all the newspapers called him a hero
 who bravely met death at his post
 ah yes he remained on his engine
 while others turned white as a ghost
 not a selfish thought entered his bosom
 he stood on the foot-board resigned
 with the lever reversed in the quadrant
 to save the three hundred behind

 his fireman was pulled out dismembered
 from under the wreck where he lay
 and he too played the part of a hero
 in fragments they bore him away
 they were there true comrades together
 their life-tide besprinkled the sod
 and within a few hours of each other
 both spirits ascended to god

 hurry fame with your brightest of laurels
 to deck poor mccarthys last bed

 he has gone beyond earthly assistance

 and lies with the heroic dead

 he is one of the army of victims
 whom duty requires each year

 to be foremost where danger is thickest
 and die like a brave engineer

 hear the multitude wail as we bear him

 all covered with flowers to the grave

 note the grief of his kinsmen jvhod tear him
 away from the ranks of the brave

 see his five little fatherless children

 who huddle up close to the bier

 hear the sobs of his heart-broken widow

 as she weeps for the dead engineer

 he is now laid to rest and forever
 he sleeps his last sleep neath the sod
 all the wails of the loved ones shall never
 recall his free spirit from god

 when on duty he never did falter-
 although he loved children and wife-
 but laid down his all on its altar

 and mind you that all was his life

 oh  i know glorious deeds are recorded
 above with a merciful pen

 and i know that all those are rewarded
 who act as the savers of men

 when gabriels trumpet gives warning
 to call up the heroic dead

 for review on eternitys morning

 brave jimmie will march at the head

 it has taken many many care-
 ful steps in planning manufac-
 turing and testing to develop the
 marvelous heat - producing
 ideal boilers and amer-
 ican radiators they are the
 final steps in heating economy
 they save heavily in fuel-save
 in care-taking save furniture
 and decorations from ash-dust
 save in doctor bills save fire
 risk to building save half the
 daily house-cleaning save in
 time and temper

are a high-class investment from every
standpoint for any size or kind of building
requiring heating

the cost of ideal boilers and amer-
ican radiators will average the lowest annual outlay for instance-an ideal-
american outfit costing  and lasting  years represents an outlay of 
only a year as there is no reason why ideal boilers and american radiators
will not last as long as the building say  years the outlay would be  only per
year the saving of a few tons of coal a year which these
outfits effect will easily repay the first cost and then produce
a handsome yearly profit on this ideal heating investment-to
say nothing of the other savings the comforts and the health
protection no one therefore can afford to continue the waste
