queen of the panther world

novel by berkeley livingston 

          illustrated by rod ruth

          the strength of queen lurid and her black panther hordes was not equal to the cunning of
          loko and his lizard men-unless luria could capture the enchanted croana bird   

mirrors of the queen

shortby richard s shaver 

           illustrated by virgil finlay

          lola was a queen in her own way-queen of the mirrors in a burlesque show but these were
          not ordinary mirrors for they opened like windows into a strange alien world   

contract for a body

novelette by webb marlowe 

          illustrated by william a gray

          it seemed like an easy way to obtain money-all you had to do was sign your name to a con-
          tract and your body was sold to be delivered after death but there was a catch   

air race

shortby warren kastel 

          illustrated by william a gray

          the niles city air race meant a lot to chocks benson especially the  first prize and the
          lack of an airplane didnt worry him for benson had a carpet-a flying one

a confidential chat with the editor

you readers may be receiving this issue of
fa a few days late we apolize for this and
dont like it any more than you do but
unfortunately we are in the midst of a strike in
the printing industry here in chicago at this
publication time and as a result your favorite
magazine has been caught in the middle of it but
dont worry about receiving future copies of fa
and the best in science-fantasy fiction it rep-
resents-well get the magazine to you if we have
to mimeograph it and send it by carrier pigeon
so bear with us

now to get down to this months stories
youve already admired the swell cover by
ramon naylor no doubt so we wont have to
tell you much about that but the story around
which the cover was painted is another matter
old-timer and top-notcher berkeley livingston
has turned in a typical livingston masterpiece in
queen of the panther world youll be a little
surprised by this yarn for youll find berk has
actually written himself in as one of the major
characters in the story you think thats bad

whos a mutant

or maybe youre wondering if it was a wise thing
for an author to do well you read the story
first and then decide then write us

richard h shaver returns this month
with a neat little fantasy also about a queen
but the queen in dicks story is quite a different
gal than the one in our lead novel for this month
dick writes about a queen of the burlesque a
lady who didnt use veils so much for sensational-
ism but mirrors and thats where the story
begins with the pecular set of mirrors used in a
burlesque act where the story ends up would
be unfair to tell you here so youll just have to
swallow the teaser weve handed you and find out
for yourself incidentally dick dropped in the
other day and said that if possible hed like to
have us tell you that hes very glad the readers of
fa have taken such an intense interest in the
shaver mystery club and that also for any
who missed the letter concerning the clubs ac-
tivities in the may issue hed be very glad to have
them get in touch with him at  lawrence
ave chicago and join we think its a good
idea too for any of you readers who want to find
out more about the shaver mystery and youll
certainly make a lot of pen-pals

this month in keeping with our policy of
presenting new writers to you as often as we
can were presenting a novelette by a new writer
in the field webb marlowe the story entitled
contract for a body is a darn good fantasy
every way you look at it it concerns a man who
needed money pretty badly and found that the
only way he could get it would be to sell his body
no not his soul-his body where is the fantasy
in that well we can assure you that youll find
plenty of it not to mention the fact that marlowe
hit on a neat twist to an old theme we think
the lad has plenty on the ball but will leave that
up to you when you write us about the story

warren kastel finishes up the issue this
month with a swell little fantasy entitled
air race this is the story of a flyer who en-
tered an air race without an airplane impossible
you say well not quite it seems that this flyer
had something that was slightly better than an
airplane-a flying carpet no dont sit back so
smug now and say you know the end of the story
sure he has to win the race you say but we
think youll be more than a little surprised at
the ending to the storywlh

i do not say that adventure can-
not begin anywhere of course it
can and usually does but let us
speak of specific places i once met a
metropolitan baritone singing in a cheap
honky-tonk on west madison street he
said it was the only place he knew of

where he could act as he wished drink
what he wanted and talk to the people
he wanted and fight with whom he
pleased turned out he had once
planned on being a fighter until some
rich woman heard him sing   

  i was once a skip-tracer for a collec-
                    it was a strange world this world of
              amazons and panthers - where all men
              bowed their heads in fear of the great queen

                                      luria   

the amazon moved quicker than i had expected and suddenly my head rocked from a terrific blow 

tion outfit and followed a man all the
way to mexico city he owed a cer-
tain merchant fifty thousand dollars
and had the money and while i was
trying to locate this skip the police of
mexico city thought i was an interna-
tional agent and dogged my steps until

one night they thought they had some-
thing on me and clapped me in the cal-
aboose and held me incommunicado for
twenty-four hours before i could get in
touch with the consulate   

  but let me be even more specific

  it began on a wondrous spring day




fantastic adventures

summer was not quite ready to thrust
its heat against us the air was warm
and fragrant with growing things i had
a couple of bucks in my kick and i had
just fallen out of love i believe i said
it was a wonderful day    well id
called henry sharpe the night before
and we had made plans to go to brook-
field zoo where the animals can come
up close and sneer at the humans

  a weekdays best sharpe said as
i slid into the seat beside him sunday
brings out the week-end nature lover
and his camera besides the animals
arent quite so bored on a week-day
maybe  

  maybe what i asked i wasnt
looking at him but was watching him
get out into the traffic of la salle
street

  nothing he said shortly he was
looking straight ahead but there was an
odd crinkle to his forehead as though
he were thinking of something which
bothered him

	 

  we parked and began the long walk
to the animal houses as hank had
predicted there werent many people
about i saw a group of school children
herded by their teacher moving de-
terminedly toward the aviary but our
paths did not converge sharpe is the
fastest walking little man ive ever
known im not on the big side myself
and its always been a problem keeping
up with him unless i go at a half-trot
after some few hundred yards i was
getting a bit winded

  hey take it easy we got all day
i said panting heavily

  sorry berk he said but its
such a relief getting away from those
damn drawings    besides im anx-
ious to see something

  so am i i said but at the rate
were moving ill need a chair to see
them in im that pooped

  we slowed after a while to a more
sedate run by that time id given up
the struggle and was dragging my tail
ten feet behind sharpe i had been so
busy just keeping pace with him i
hadnt even noticed where he had made
his goal i leaned my weight over the
iron rail and looked across the moat
to where the animals lolled in the sun
the scene was a rocky bit of jungle
land there were painted limitations of
rocks bushes trees and a small grotto
led to the inside cages there were some
four of them there great black things
panthers all mama papa and a couple
of baby panthers which didnt look any
different than their parents at least
their teeth were no smaller when they
yawned

ne of them rose and strolled to
the edge of the moat and fell to
his haunches and stared at us out of
his great yellow eyes theres some-
thing about the big cats lions tigers
panthers the whole feline tribe down
to the smallest tabby that reaches right
down and pulls at the atavistic remem-
brances of man i felt the hair rise at
the nape and knew my breath was
catching as the beast looked at the two
of us it was as though i could reach
through the bone and fur to that tiny
brain and pluck out what lay there it
was as if he was saying five minutes
out there and wed see whod be boss

  thats right baby i said aloud
but youre in there and im out
here  

  huh hank whirled to me

  i grinned and told him what i had
been thinking of but the grin was
wiped from my lips at what i saw in
his eyes they were just wild in excite-
ment

  so you heard it too he said

  heard what i asked

  what the panther said
queen of the panther world



  now wait a minute i didnt hear
anything a picture formed in my mind
of what the beast might be thinking if
he could think

  he turned back then and looked at
the beast i saw that his fingers were
white against the rail i saw too that
the knuckles were bloodless something
was wrong i puzzled over it then
turned my attention to another of the
tribe this one i hadnt seen before he
was coming out of the semi-darkness
of the grotto into the sunlight i gasped
at the size of him he was the biggest
panther id ever seen a full seven feet
from head to tail-tip he stalked out
into the sunlight and stood poised the
only movement a sinuous twitch of the
black tail i dont know how the beast
at the lip of the moat heard or knew
of the others presence but before our
amazed eyes it turned and leaped to-
ward the other with a blood-chilling
scream of anger

  i heard hanks sibilant intake of
breath heard the muted aah that
came from his lips but my whole at-
tention was taken by the drama be-
fore us

  the giant panther waited the coming
of the smaller one with the utmost
equanamity it didnt do any more than
face the other not even its tail
twitched yet when the smaller one was
but a few paces away in fact the other
had already leaped in a wild lunge
then the big beast moved but when it
moved it was a greased streak of black
lightning i have never seen anything
move so fast one second it was facing
its adversary the next it had reared
and slashed at the bundle of charged
dynamite which had flung itself at him
there was but a single blow there
must have been terrific power in that
paw to do what it did for the smaller
beast was flung a good five yards
through the air it landed heavily on

its back rolled over and began to drag
itself toward the other i saw then that
its back had been broken by the blow
i let a whistle escape my lips

  there was more to come as though
the smaller ones leap had been a signal
all the others converged on the single
monstrous thing in the center of the
arena only this time the immense
beast did not wait for the attack it
leaped like a bolt straight for the
largest of its enemies i didnt know
that the big cats felt or knew fear at
least not till then but as the huge thing
left its feet the smaller one turned and
leaped screaming for the protection of
the grotto and behind it came the oth-
ers i turned quickly to the remaining
one it stood facing the grotto mouth
after it landed there was a snarl on
its mouth and the huge canines turned
me cold inside

t couldnt take my eyes from the
monster it moved so slowly so pre-
meditatively i watched it move toward
the maimed panther which had stopped
its futile movement and lay stretched
full length on the ground the big one
approached the other at an angle when
it was only a few feet away it swerved
and came in from the rear the beast on
the ground must have had an intuitive
idea why because it tried to turn to face
the enemy before it could complete
the turn the big one was on him it was
over quickly a single bone-crunching
snap of the huge jaws and life departed
for the broken-backed panther it was
then the keepers appeared

  a shuddering sigh was wrenched
from hanks lips as the keepers busied
themselves with fire hoses used i sup-
posed for just such an emergency the
powerful streams of water hit the pan-
ther from three sides and drove him
snarling backward to the grotto when
it finally disappeared into it a gate was


fantastic adventures

lowered i wanted to stay and see what
happened then but hank had other
ideas

  no ive seen enough he said be-
sides ive got something to tell you

  we didnt go far only to the place
where the elephants stood great brown
splotches against the deeper brown of
their surroundings hank made sure we
were removed from the rest of the
crowd before he began to talk

  berk do you think im goofy he
asked

  the goofiest guy i know i said
with a laugh ive always said that

  he should have smiled he should
have done anything but what he did
grab my wrist and pull me closer to
him

  wait he said sharply im not
kidding let me start from the begin-
ning because that way ill get things
in order

  in the first place you know the kind
of guy i am about animals always
traipsing off somewhere to the forest
preserve or the dunes or some zop or
other just because i like to see the ani-
mals the big ones and the little ones
ive always been interested in them as
if there was a bond between us youve
often mentioned that im the only guy
you know who can walk up to a cat for
instance and immediately itll start pur-
ring or to a dog no matter how big
and itll eat out of my hand well
something strange happened last week
brookfield opened then for the summer
of course i was one of the first to get
here

  well through the years ive become
pretty well-known out here and they
let me have my run of the place so the
first thing happens joe edson the head
keeper grabs me and drags me up to the
big cat house takes me up to the pan-
ther cage and says

   look hank

  look at what i asked

   the size of that cat 

  berk it was the biggest cat ive
ever seen now get this panthers are
the smallest of the big cats theyre
really small lions but this baby the
same one we just saw was bigger than
even the biggest lion but it was a pan-
ther it was a panther but for one thing
its canines they were those of a tiger
bigger longer berk than any tigers
i was following him pretty good so
far he hadnt said anything to warrant
the state of excitement he was in but i
hadnt heard everything

  he went on

  ed got a call from one of the keepers
just then and i was left alone the cat
was in a far corner soon as ed left the
cat got up and moved close to the bars
and faced me he looked at me with
those devils eyes of his and his lips
parted in a grin damn it was almost
human that grin i wondered where
they got such a magnificent animal   
berk i swear to god this is what hap-
pened the cat said you wouldnt be-
lieve it if it were told to you 

t know i was smiling when he said
what he did and i know the smile
was still on my face as i turned and
looked him full in the eyes but a cold
rope dragged itself down my spine and
of a sudden my hands felt clammy with
sweat he must have seen something of
what went on in my mind because he
went on quickly

  yeah sounds goofy really insane
but true as i stand here with you its
the truth and theres even more i guess
i just stared at the damned cat sud-
denly it moved back and forth against
the bars in that sinuous walk only cats
have after a few turns it came back
and faced me again it was just as
though its mind was troubled and the
turns it took enabled it to clear its mind
queen of the panther world



for what it wanted to say she brought
me here to prove something but now
im in this prison and only she can get
me out you must help me

  there were words trembling on my
lips but they simply wouldnt pass i
was speechless yet he read my mind
for he answered the words which had
formed in me you are the only person
on this planet who can help me project
your thoughts into the great void call
luria  and when the answer comes
say that mokar believes  

  i guess i was in a sort of mental fog
for a while after that because the next
remembrance was of my studio i sort
of came out of the trance i was in and
found myself on the couch i know that
i had left the zoo and driven back to
fhe studio i must have anyway the
first thought in my mind was what mo-
kar had said i did it  

  did what hank i breathed softly

  called to this luria

  and   

  she not only answered she came to
me not in flesh he hastily assured me
it was a sort of picture i got of her
oh man what a picture though i deal
in beauty now and then we run across
some beautiful models but this luria
   out of this world is the only way to
describe her her skin was white as the
proverbial snow and yet it had an odd
pinkish glow to it her hair was mid-
night and it sparkled as though a mil-
lion snow flakes were reflecting light
from it she wore a breastplate which
concealed her charms yet barely cov-
ered the swelling flesh so that my breath
was taken from me below the plate she
was bare to her loins which again were
covered by a leather belt from which
dangled a jeweled dagger in her hand
the right one she carried a spear with
an immense blade slim and murderous
looking

  she was clothed in mist which

swirled and eddied about her because
of this strange mist the picture was none
too clear except in glimpses but the
oddest part of the whole scene was a
something that lurked in the back-
ground lurked is the only word for it
it was never clear at all i got the feel-
ing of a long body wetly metallic-look-
ing and covered by a serrated series of
spines but as i say im not sure may-
be that was the proof of my halluci-
nated state

  i released my breath in a sigh and
said

  the wrong one of us is writing id
say this dame brought out tbe poet in
you hank never have i heard a
woman described so now look  

  i was sober more sober than at any
time of my life he said as though he
knew what i was going to say but let
me finish the message of mokar came
to my mind and i saw her lips smile
they formed words and across the
misty dimness came the answer tell
mokar i shall come for him soon he
hesitated for an instant open and closed
his mouth and finally said nothing

  and thats the last youve ever heard
of or seen the beautiful dream gal lu-
ria i said

  he shook his head yes

j didnt know what to say hank
sharpe was my dearest friend he
was a mixture of the strangest things
for at one and the same time he was the
most hard-headed clear-thinking man
id ever known and at the same time
the worlds greatest romanticist he
spoke of the evil of man with a knowing
look yet he could not believe evil of
anyone he was as small as i and even
thinner and no one has ever called me
big-boy but he was as strong as a horse
with hands that were like a carpenters
tough and muscular ive seen him slap
a guy and send the guy all the way


fantastic adventures

across a tavern floor with that slap he
had a head that was bit too large for
the rest of him with a face that was
long and lean and handsome and there
was nothing i wouldnt do for the guy
   but this deal he was talking of
sounded like a hashish dream

  it couldnt be though

  there might be a way of finding out
i thought of a sudden look hank
i said lets mosey over to the cat
house i want to see something

  there was quite a crowd on the out-
side evidently the word of the fight
had spread and they had gathered to
see what there was to be seen there
wasnt much what blood had flowed
had been washed clean by the hoses
of the cats nothing was to be seen we
strolled around and walked into the
huge place it was apparent which cage
the panthers were in by the crowd
watching we joined the others

  being on the small side we edged our
way through the crowd until we stood
against the iron railing which separated
the cages from the spectators the an-
imals in the cage were restless whether
it was the fight which had made them
so or something else they paced back
and forth growls rumbling deep in their
throats and sometimes coming past the
furry pockets oddly enough the larg-
est and most ferocious the huge jet-
black beast whose name was mokar
was the least restive he lolled at his
ease on the shelf which they used for
resting and sleeping

  he was lying there until he spotted
us then with an immense and effortless
leap he was at the bars his great yellow
eyes searching our faces suddenly it
happened i swear mokar smiled those
fearsome lips parted in a huge cats grin
and hank turned to me and said
lets go he understood

  it was just too much for me i shook
my head and started to follow hank

but i hadnt done more than make a
half-turn when he gripped my forearm
so hard i yipped in pain

  its her he whispered in a voice
of awe

  like a flash i followed the direction
of his eyes and beheld her i knew it
was her yet she was like night and day
as far as accuracy of description only
in the small wave of hair which peeked
beneath the hood of her coat was there
something of what hed described the
hair whose blackness held the sheen of
a million reflected snowflakes her skin
too was as he said but that face it
was the face of a million mens dreams
so alluring so innocent eyes that
begged for love and knew only virtue
lips whose redness made one hungry for
their touch and a skin that was like a
flower petal i felt my fingers contract
in a spasm as though they had a will
to fly toward that loveliness for a
caress

  your friend likes me the girl said

  she had spoken and in perfectly un-
derstandable english

  im glad she went on mokar will
be too

  he will i said

  but of course he has learned his
lesson and i have found what i looked
for now we will go out of this place of
prison into the clean air come

jt was a command and we fol-
lowed she led us directly to one
of the open-air confectionery stands
she walked up and ordered an ice cream
cone i reached for the dime automat-
ically but hank ordered two more and
paid for them she turned and walked
to a bench close by we followed as if
we were tied to her by a string so we
sat the three of us munching on our
cones until the last of them were licked
up all the while she sat and stared at
anything and everything but us
queen of the panther world



  she sighed breathless after a while
and still looking straight ahead said
it is good not to be alone poor
mokar he missed me and could not
get through the valley of the mists to
me luckily he found you my friend
hank is a slow-acting guy most of
the time then again he acts with the
speed of a fighter throwing a counter
punch this was one of those times
suddenly his hands imprisoned hers
and he was facing her

  uh huh hank said thats right
he found me and you found me so that
makes everything just right but where
does it leave me

  she was innocence itself how do
you mean

  who are you where do you come
from whats this all about this busi-
ness with mokar how did you manage
to hypnotize me into the dream i had
hank shook her hands imprisoned in
his for emphasis

  she didnt answer immediately but
looked down at her hands which were
beginning to show a redness from the
tightness of his grip hank flushed and
released her hands she threw back her
head in an odd gesture and the hood fell
away from those beautiful tresses which
fell in a wonderfully effective wave
about her shoulders even i who can
take my women or leave them alone
felt a thrill at the sight

  i am luria she said you know
that and i come from the valley of the
mists  

  you come in dreams hank said
in dreams of mist and terror

  i gaped at the man what the heck
had gotten into him he had turned so
that his profile was to us this time it
was she who took the initiative she
took hold of his hands and began to
talk

  i came to you across the great void
it was hard for i was already here and

i had to transpose my soul-self back to
the place from whence id come there
is no other but you who can understand
me yet we live side by side our worlds
are the same the same in the same
time will you come back with me and
live in this side-by-side world the time
has come when i have need of you

  wait a minute hank i broke in
before he could give this girl an answer
dont listen to her its some sort of
gimmick shes got thats working you
i dont trust her

  i do berk he said i know shes
in trouble i guess i knew it from the
beginning and i want you to come
along with us

  oh boy i chortled in simulated
glee aint that going to be just ducky
come on along and play he says and
how do we do that hold hands across
a table while the lights are out and wait
for the message

  youre not scared are you he
asked

  now were playing kid games i
said i dare you  

j-je turned again so that he was
facing her is it possible to bring
my friend along

  she nodded the wrinkle went out of
his forehead and a smile lighted his
face he got up and stepped in front
of me

  well he asked

  well what i was mad yet at the
same time i felt a thrill of excitement
 i thought if such a thing could be
why i could write of it later fame and
fortune could be waiting for me at the
end of the trail but what the heck were
we dreaming of the whole thing was a
lot of talk dream stuff and coincidence
i snorted loudly hank turned back to
her and said

  see its my personal charm he
cant resist it its because i smoke


fantastic adventures

regents they give off that wonderful
aroma and make me nonchalant also
an outcast berk smells that way nat-
urally

  mokar will be glad she says he
likes your friend

  yeah i said quick-like well i
like him too just where hes at behind
bars

  oh she said just as quickly he
wont be for very long when you get
to know him better youll grow much
more fond of him hes so affectionate

  then he and hankll get along swell
hanks an animal lover now why
couldnt he have been crazy about fish
ive always been wild about mermaids
i said

  hank hummed a bit about wild
about nellie i was too far from him
to get in a kick at his shins suddenly
she rose it was a movement that was
as lithe and sinuous as an animals her
fingers threw the hood back around her
hair hank started to join her but she
shook her head

  no i must go alone she said

  but how   

  she knew what he meant i will
come to you when the time comes she
said nor will it be long

  i covered a grin now she was cook-
ing with butane so she was going to
come when the time was ripe i figured
wed better not hold our breaths that
long wed probably be ripe too

  but hank was all trust and hope he
acted like a kid with the promise of a
day at the circus before him his eyes
were shining in anticipation of the day
man alive youd think he was ten in-
stead of thirty his eyes followed her
trim but very trim figure until it dis-
appeared into the big cat house

  okay kid i said you can wake
up dreams over

  his lips were bent in a crooked grin
but his eyes were dark in some inner

thought which was extremely pleasant

     not yet he said after a mo-
ment

jt was some day in the week i
think tuesday at any rate it wasnt
long after our visit to the zoo that i got
a phone call from hank i was busy on
a fantasy for fantastic adventures
that had to do with flying disks and i
wanted to get some of the facts in order
i had a fistful of clippings on my desk
a cigarette burning itself to death in the
ashtray and a brow full of wrinkles on
my forehead the phone at my side rang
and i cussed it as i lifted it from the
cradle

  yeah

  berk hanks voice crackled in ex-
citement come on over but fast

  oh fine i thought hes been dream-
ing again then another thought pierced
me through maybe   

  you mean    i began

  right drop what youre doing and
shoot out here

  but look i began there was no
need to go on unless i wanted to talk
to myself hed hung up believe me i
was in just that mood talking to myself
i mean the disk story had to be on the
editors desk by friday and i had a
good six thousand words to do on it yet
the air was blue with nasty words as i
shoved the chair away from the desk
and put the old money-machine away
now why did hank have to dream i
thought as i put on a pair of slacks i
work in shorts and nothing else a tee
shirt followed the slacks and then socks
and shoes i gave the desk a look of
regret as i turned for a last look before
closing the door it was going to be a
long time before i saw that desk or
room again

  hank shared a loft studio on north
state street with a couple of other
queen of the panther world



artists he was alone sitting before his
work desk there was a half-finished
pen and ink drawing on the board he
heard my clattering steps on the rickety
stairs and met me at the door he
grabbed my wrist and dragged me into
his part of the studio

  last night he began without pre-
amble she came to me she said she
would see me again this afternoon she
was in trouble i saw it in her face ive
got to help her berk weve-got to help
her

  i tried to throw some cold water on
him the whole deal had lost its appeal
to me what the heckl i had this story
to do for the boss and besides  i
found a seat among the magazines on
a chair and said

  now listen to me hank im seri-
ous i went along with this dream-book
stuff you gave me because i thought it
was some kind of a gag i didnt know
it was serious but if it is youd better
see a psychiatrist hallucinations may
be all right until they reach the stage
where a man cant tell them from
reality

  i guess its time we talked this thing
over seriously i dont know how it be-
gan but i can hazard a guess ill bet
you went to a party with some of those
wacky friends of yours and there was
a hypnotist there and so the gag was
for him to use you as a guinea pig ill
bet there was this gal we met at the
party the idea being to see how far
post-hypnotism would work ive got to
hand it to the lad who did the hynotiz-
ing he did an a-l job

  uh uh hank said youre wrong
youre   

  we both noticed it at the same time
all of a sudden there was a terrific
breeze in the room i started to close
the window only i didnt make it it
was as if someone had glued me to the
chair i was in i could see hear smell

reason but couldnt act i was aware of
what was going on only i seemed not
to be part of it

  i say there was a great gust of blow-
ing in the room yet not a paper stirred
not a leaf in the magazines turned in
fact not a material thing felt the winds
effect except hank and myself i saw
his hair blowing about his face saw his
shirt collar flap against his chin and
knew the same thing was happening to
me i was turned three-quarters to the
window and though i couldnt turn
completely i saw that not a leaf stirred
on a tree directly outside the window
not a bit of dust blew and i even saw
a man mop his brow below us the wind
increased and with it came a cloud of
darkness its the only way i can de-
scribe it it was a mist of inky black-
ness and it flowed up from out of no-
where i tried to move out of its path
i could feel my muscles strain as i did
my utmost to lift myself from its path
as it rolled toward hank and me but
though the sweat stood out on my fore-
head in huge damp drops and rolled
down my arms and chest all my efforts
were unavailing the black curtain en-
veloped us it not only encircled us so
that nothing was to be seen beyond it
it also did something to our minds for
suddenly all was darkness

hp here was a dull feeling at the
back of my head and my neck felt
stiff i opened my eyes and looked
blankly about me we were both still
sitting as we had been hank looked
asleep i shook my head and instantly
realized the spell or whatever it was
was gone

  hey hank wake up fella

  as i called to him i rose from my
chair i groaned aloud as every bone in
my body ached with the effort my
words seemed to have no effect i stag-
gered a bit in the few feet which sep-


fantastic adventures

the monstrous beasts were coming at ui
with the speed of express trains and
the riders were shouting in triumph   
queen of the panther world



arated us my hand had little life in it
as it shook him weakly but it was
enough his eyes opened and looked
dazedly about him then they began to
focus and reason returned to their
depths the old grin appeared on them
and he said

  well what do you say now

   blew out my breath and sighed was
nothing going to convince him but of
course all he had to do was see the out-
side i whirled and pointing through the
glass said

  lo-oo-yeow 

  the last was a screech of horror this

wasnt state street this wasnt chi-
cago this wasnt anything id ever
seen this was hell

  we were no longer three flights up
we were at ground level and what
ground it looked like some cataclysm
of nature had ripped and twisted the
ground in a mad convulsion it was bare
of foliage and brown and hard with
huge boulders strewn about as if giants
had been rolling them in a game of
bowls we seemed to be in a sort of
hollow like the bottom of a soup plate
t couldnt see what lay beyond the lip
of the bowl hank must have seen the


fantastic adventures

terror and bewilderment in my eyes he
rose and stepped to my side

  holy cats he breathed softly

  i could think of other things i
said all appropriate to the land-
scape

  save it he said sharply lets
take a look around

  too anxious i wasnt to see what there
was to be seen but i wouldnt have
stayed alone in the room for all the tea
in china matter of fact i hoped we
were in china but at the pit of my
stomach was a feeling we werent in
china it was the kind of feeling which
said brother youre in the next place
to where youve always said youre
going

  if hank had any fears they were
well concealed he moved along head
up and shoulders back like he knew ex-
actly where he was going my steps
lagged but only a few yards behind his
we climbed the few feet to the lip of
the earthen bowl and looked about i
know my mouth hung open and that to
anyone who might have been looking
on i played the part of an idiot very
well at least i had company

r  he ground fell away below our
feet steeply for a distance of per-
haps a thousand feet below us lay a
sight to gladden the heart of any farmer
the ground was checkerboarded in neat
patterns that sometimes were squares
and sometimes rectangles and some-
times even triangles of color there
were trees heavy-planted like park-
lands and we could see areas which
looked dark with luxurious growth the
air was warm and fragrant and peace-
ful it was a placid scene

  but only for a moment

  immediately below us the ground was
sheer but to either side the slope was
gradual suddenly there was a great
snorting chorus of animal sounds to our

right and we turned as one to see what
made them ive been scared before
but this was the first time id ever been
so frightened that i knew what it was
to be rooted to one spot

  coming up at us with the speed of
express trains were some ten or fifteen
animals the likes of which id never
seen they were part lizard and part
elk there was the head of an elk
mounted on a lizards body but such a
lizard as i didnt believe existed i
didnt wait for hanks shout of warn-
ing i had already turned and started
downward for the place we had just
quitted but my terror rose to a fevered
pitch when i saw that there was noth-
ing there the room or vehicle of trans-
port into this strange and terrible world
had disappeared there was nothing
but the convulsed earth and boulders

  it wouldnt have made any difference
anyway these monstrous beasts were
too swift

  now there was the sounds of voices
about us english voices commands to
halt shouts of anger and some of specu-
lation then above the others a bull-
like bellow

  stop fools stop ere we rip you
apart

  we came to a sliding stop and side
by side waited for i guess death the
beasts ground to dust-clouded stops
then as their riders dismounted they
looked at us through their soft strangely
gentle eyes but there was nothing
peaceful or gentle in the eyes or faces
of the men who surrounded us oh no
they looked fierce and very unwel-
coming

  i essayed a grin and swallowed
hastily as the first of them came close
beside me hanks breath whistled
shrilly as he tensed in anticipation of
battle not that we stood any chance if
there was going to be not with the way
these babies were adorned
queen of the panther world



  insofar as size was concerned they
looked no bigger than most men from
where wed come nor were they any
different in facial or physical charac-
teristics except maybe in fierceness
of looks it was just their get-up
they wore little helmets serrated and
adorned with a strip of feather their
chests were covered by a wide strip of
metal leaving their bellies bare they
wore gauntlets of the same metal and
their legs were also covered to some
three inches above their knees the
metal was very flexible because it gave
as they walked from their waists to
where the leg covering began was a
kind of link-metal skirt it rang metal-
lically as they moved about there was
a belt of leather about their waists
from it hung on one side a dagger and
on the other a sword

  who are you from whence come
you asked one who was evidently the
leader he was the biggest and certainly
looked the most fierce a scar which ran
the length of one cheek to his chin giv-
ing him the most terrifying look

  my mouth opened and closed opened
and closed but no sound came out it
was hank who took the lead

  i am henry sharpe and this is
berkeley livingston he said we
come from-from chicago he ended
weakly

  i knew how he felt but what the
devil were we to say to those questions

rt he leader of this strange troop
mulled the words over to himself
as though they were some strange food
he was tasting his eyes were on the
ground as he mumbled to himself sud-
denly they lifted and pierced us with
their fiery glance i felt my knees turn
to water at that uncompromising stare
i knew i was too young to die

  of this place from whence you come
i have no knowledge the big guy said

perhaps loko may have he is all-
wise mount these men and let us be
off before we are discovered we are
still a long way from home

  immediately his men began a tune-
less whistling at which their strange
mounts came trotting one of them gave
me a hand and i slid up until i sat just
outside the pocket of the flat saddle
they used hank too was lifted to the
back of one of the elk-lizard deals and
in an instant we were off and i mean
off and running man oh man how
those babies could travel theyd have
walked off with all honors at any track
in the u s

  i dont know exactly how long we
rode timehadnomeaning ourwatches
had stopped the sun stood at the
zenith all the time all i know is that
my back was sore my legs were numb
and that this character behind whom
i was riding had never taken a bath in
his life the only thing which held
meaning for me was the changes in
scenery for perhaps a mile after we
started the road or path or whatever
it was we followed was level and flat
then we came to a forest land into
which we rode with the same abandon
as before the trees were thick and
the branches often swept low so that
i was continually ducking to stop from
being swept off my mount this went
on for hours it seemed then we were
in the open again but the topogra-
phy had changed the gentle slopes
were gone this was hill country rough
and a little frightening we didnt ride
directly upward but at a long slant i
didnt notice at first but later i did that
we always rode where there was some
sort of shelter the open places were
avoided with assiduous care

  my fears lessened or dulled as the
ride went on interminably and i looked
about with more appraising glances for
a land which held the appearances of


fantastic adventures

care there were less people about than
i would imagine there to be since the
sun was always at zenith time had
little meaning at least in the sense we
have of time this might be the time for
sleep or dinner or lunch or breakfast
for all i knew at least they were rea-
sons for the lack of activity in this
weird place of ever-sunlight

  suddenly i was hungry but i mean
hungry it wasnt just a gnawing feel-
ing it was a flood of demands for food
my rider was in the center of the troop
hank was up ahead somewhere not far
from the leader i was too far back to
see the gesture which was the command
to halt but there came shouted words
from ahead

  halt eat eat

  my rider kicked with his right heel at
the leathery side of the beast we were
riding and the monster slid to a halt
we slid off and joined the rest i was
stiff and sore as i found a seat beside
hank on a grassy hummock there was
a far-away look in his eyes and it wasnt
one of hunger for once my interest was
not on his thoughts or mood i was
hungry

t guess i looked my disgust when
i saw the meal we were to have it
came from saddle bags which were at-
tached to the animals we had been rid-
ing my buddy strode up to me and
held the unappetizing piece of leathery
whatever-it-was in his hand

  well bless your little i said
thats decent of you old man i must
say

  he had a half smile on his lips as he
stood there with the stuff in his hand at
my words the smile went away but fast
and his free hand shot out and cuffed
me alongside the jaw

  i am not an old man he said in
vicious tones

  now im a peace-loving individual

the sort of guy in fact who will not
just walk away from trouble ill run
from it comes a tavern brawl and im
the first to head for under the table in
an argument im the oil-spreader so
maybe it was that i was hungry and
tired and sore or maybe i was guttier
than i thought but suddenly before i
could reason i was on my feet and at
this character

  i hit him with a left and right and
another left and right all on the puss
then i shot one to his belly and he
folded up like a wind-broken accordion
a last right this one on the button and
he spun away for about ten feet to land
flat on his back

  it all happened pretty fast faster
than the telling of it what happened
after was just as quick instantly the
rest of these characters came at a run
the big guy who was boss-man at their
head he looked down at schmoe on the
grass looking up at the blue with va-
cant eyes then looked at me there was
a puzzled glint to his eyes

  what happened he asked

  i was surprised at the politeness of
tone

  i dont go for slapping around i
said

  no i must tell you then he said
in that same polite tone that certain
formalities must be observed as soon as
hago has recovered his senses he will
ask for reprisals it is the custom here
my friend

  yeah hank said sharply as only
a sharpe can ask and what will those
be

  edged with tips of steel of course
the big guy said casually

  hey hank said angrily berk
doesnt know anything about duelling
with swords

  nor about duelling with anything else
but my mouth i thought maybe we
could fight a duel that way of course
queen of the panther world



i hadnt done badly with my fists   

  the big guy shrugged his shoulders
and all the metal he carried clanked an
accompaniment hank brought up an-
other point

  besides berk doesnt have the pro-
tection of armor

  then it will be over quickly the
big goon said

  suddenly hank grinned a fine time
to smile i thought i was going to die
and ray palmer wasnt going to get
that story after all and all sharpe the
sharpy can do is laugh about it my
bosom buddy my pal hank i thought
if ever you ask me to listen to one of
those corny jokes you like to tell ill
throw joe miller down your throat

  and what of loko hank asked
wont he be angry

  the big guy stroked the scar on his
cheek he nodded several times as
though in agreement with what hank
had brought up then he too smiled and
i thought hank bosom buddy youre
a prince with the wit youre fast like
a rabbit now why didnt i think of
that

  yes loko would be angry espe-
cially if he knew there had been two of
you and i brought only one in   

both hank and i stopped smiling
the familiar chill found its groove
and raced down my spine i didnt need
an interpretation of what he said in
effect the less loko knew the less he
would be angry about

  the rest of the gang with the excep-
tion of hago had gathered around
while the palavar had been going on
they ringed us in with a fence of steel
for their swords were out i looked from
face to face and found nothing in any
to give me hope of the future i swal-
lowed the lump which formed in my
throat and wished i could be brave and
come up with the kind of quip the usual

story-book hero had in a moment like
this blank that was my mind

  but not hanks oh no he had
things to say i wished he hadnt
seemed like every time he opened his
yap trouble came out

  is this how you welcome strangers
he asked

  if nothing else the big guy liked to
chew the fat

  strangers are never welcome here on
hosay they are always troublesome
this way our troubles and yours in-
cidently will soon be over and the path
of our lives will be smooth again

  we didnt ask to come here hank
said

  that was a lie but at this point of
the game i didnt think it made any
difference

  no-o then how did you come

  luria made us hank said

  by all that was holy id forgotten
about the gorgeous doll who had
brought us this trouble i remembered
now and blessed her with a few choice
epithets none of which would look nice
in print

  luria his voice rose until it al-
most sounded feminine she brought
you across the void ho-ho loko will
surely want to see you well hago can
wait his vengeance for a bit i dont
think you will be leaving hosay very
soon well weve spent enough time
in talk let us eat and be off again

  funny how my appetite got lost i
took maybe two bites out of the leathery
stuff but even though id lost my hun-
ger i had to admit to the tastiness of
the stuff then we were back in the
saddle and riding hell-bent for wherever
they were going whether my muscles
had grown used to the gruelling pace or
just that id grown numb i dont know
but now i didnt feel so weary so that
in the end when we topped a rise and
came to the valley which held the tribe


fantastic adventures

of loko i felt an odd sense of aware-
ness of things

  i say it was a valley actually it
wasnt but on first appearance it
seemed that rather to be proper it was
a plain which stretched for a vast dis-
tance and which lay between two ranges
of hills that were not quite high enough
to be called mountains as we rode
down the shallow pass which led to the
city i speculated on the familiarity of
the place as we got closer i knew what
the resemblance was it looked like the
stretch of pueblos in taos new mex-
ico of course there was the differ-
ence of soil conditions and mountain
stretches but im speaking of the habi-
tations our coming had been noticed
long before our arrival and a great num-
ber of riders came dashing out to meet
us all mounted on the elk-lizards

  they yelled shouted and waved their
swords about as they closed in on our
small company pandemonium is a long
word but its the only one which fit the
situation we must have stretched out
for a good mile as we rode down the
long street between the pueblos until
we reached the most imposing one that
was a good five stories high

  this one was different from the rest
in that instead of the ladder it had a
broad staircase which circled about the
entire structure then while the others
waited hank and i between several
guards mounted the staircase and pro-
ceeded upward behind the big guy who
was the leader of the troop

 t the fifth story we came to a
broad gate there were armed sen-
tries standing guard before it through
the open lattice-work of iron i could see
other men standing watch whoever
loko was he liked protection the big
guy exchanged words with the guards
who in turn called something to those
inside and the gates swung open there

was something ominous in the way those
huge iron things closed behind us

  once more we went on the march we
had come into a shallow courtyard
birds of brilliant plumage sang from
trees the courtyard was circular with
several entrances to the building we had
as our goal the center entrance was
for us straight for it and into the cool-
ness of a vast room where all was peace
the big guy led us here we came to a
halt i looked about and wondered why
we stopped here the room had but a
single entrance or exit the doorway
through which wed come the answer
came in a few seconds

  suddenly we started to rise all of us
and i knew we were on a sort of plat-
form much like that of a stage it was
then i saw the openings high in the
walls above there were three quite
large when we reached the level of
these openings the platform stopped its
ascent and once more we stepped for-
ward again it was the center opening
which was our goal this too had guards
and after the usual exchange of talk we
were allowed entry

  it was a long rectangular room in
which we found ourselves at one end
was a dais on which was a long table
there were six men sitting at this table
the walls of the room to either side of
the dais held couches and seats the
room was empty but for the men up
ahead we were led forward until we
stopped some fifteen feet from the dais
then the big guy stepped forward

  mighty loko he began i am
captain mita in charge of the group
who went in search of the holy groana
bird i have come before your greatness
with a strange story  

  all the while id been giving this
loko character the once-over i didnt
know he was loko until mita called him
by name but he was the sort of person
you give a second and even a third
queen of the panther world



glance the trouble was i didnt look
at the rest not until hank nudged me
and whispered from the side of his
mouth

  the women look at them

  it was small wonder that i hadnt
noticed them as i said i thought there
were six men up there in front of us
they were all dressed alike except
loko their uniforms were much like
mitas except they were more elaborate
with jewels sending showers of vari-
colored lights at us then i saw the
breastplates and realized for the first
time that of the six people up there four
were women

  the fifth was a giant of a man easily
even though he was seated better than
seven feet tall the sixth was loko he
was dressed in a toga-like gown which
fell in a straight line from his thin wrin-
kled neck to his feet from the center of
the toga straight down the center was a
line of color demarcation one side of
the robe was a bright purple the other
a deep green then loko started to talk
and i forgot all else

  who are these two from whence
come they and how did you come upon
them

  apt ain mit a related how he
 found us all went well until he
mentioned luria i thought theyd leap
down our collective throats so great was
their excitement all but loko his lean
face didnt show a muscle change and
his eyes peered narrowly down at us
as though their piercing glance could
read what lay beneath the flesh and
bone of our foreheads their voices rose
in shrill cacophony the gist of which
was we ought to be put to death imme-
diately suddenly loko raised a thin
arm which shook slightly

  peace this chattering as though
you were but birds in the courtyard to
whom had been cast seed peace i say

  are your minds so dulled by the
games of war that they see only what
lies on the surface look ye well on
these strangers do they have the look
of any men we know they have not
spoken their minds yet but ill warrant
their speech is foreign as their attire
they knew not of swordplay one used
his fists as a weapon but all this non-
observance can be forgiven it is in the
misconstruing of the fact they knew
luria that i speak let me assure ye
they are accidental arrivals here on
pola there are some things which are
as open pages to us but the art of trans-
posing humans from one plane of time
to another is the closed page which not
one of us can open for we have not the
key not even luria the all-wise
woman

  oman the father of luria was the
wisest man who ever lived the small
knowledge i have was gained at his
knee but even he with all the secrets
of the ancients at his minds disposal
could not do that i do not say that she
in some fashion known only to her was
able to bring them across the great void
between the land of the eternal mists
from the place from whence they came
to pola but only these two came

  i do not know who they are or why
they were brought here but look ye well
on them can ye see the smallest sign
in them which would bring harm to us
or disturb the smallest detail of our
plan

  the old character was right we were
a couple of harmless schmoes as far as
i was concerned i had had my fill of this
place all i wanted was to be put back
on that black cloud and taken back to
that place from whence wed come

  however he went on it would be
of great interest to us to find how where
and when luria managed all this shall
we ask them

  mitas boys acted too fast for us to


fantastic adventures

do anything about it they were well-
trained loko had barely finished talk-
ing and our arms were pinioned behind
our backs i started to struggle but gave
up as the guards arms tightened about
me yet a strange fact registered at the
back of my mind a fact i was going to
put to use later i knew this guy hold-
ing my arms behind me was straining
all his muscles in the effort and yet if i
wanted to i could have quite easily
broken his grip

  the guy who had been sitting beside
loko was better than seven feet tall
the instant we became helpless the five
of them left their companion on the dais
and swarmed about us

  so they like to use the fist eh he
had a bellow like a bull he stood sprad-
dle-legged in front of us his arms
akimbo he threw his head back and
let out a roar of laughter the sound
echoed around the huge room i had to
strain to look up at him he was that
big

  sure i said whats more id use
them on you too you big schmoe   

tit e threw a punch at me that was
telegraphed like a slow freight
through missouri i ducked just as it
arrived only i forgot about the guy
behind me i ducked backward and my
head cracked against his face and came
forward in a rebound smack into that
ham-like fist i wont say it felt like be-
ing hit by a pillow on the other hand
ive been hit a lot harder a heck of a
lot i shook my head clear and grinned
up at the no-longer smiling face

  better try again i said that i
can take all day

  me and my big yap boy did i take
the lumps he hit me with everything
but that meat cleaver he carried at his
side and hed have probably used that
except he was that mad i was covered
with blood mine and he was covered

with glory when he got through at
least it sounded like an ovation he got
i staggered to my feet and looked to
where hank was

  he had that beefy look around his
jawbones too it was the first time either
of us had been jumped by a gang of
women i guess hank was thankful this
was one world where women didnt have
the pregorative of scratching hed of
been a lot bloodier than he was on the
other hand it isnt the most pleasant
thing to have women pounding lumps on
you

  but though his head was bloodied it
wasnt bowed he winked at me i
thought it looked like a wink of course
with all that swelling around his eyes it
could have been something else i
grinned back at him and the two of them
turned to face the gang that had jumped
us they were standing together just in
front of the dais evidently theyd been
talking to the old goat theyd left at the
table

  i see loko said your planet
breeds stubborn men a pity because
we have the means to undo those stub-
born tongues i would very much dislike
causing any additional suffering un-
less of course you force my hand   
perhaps hank managed to get out
between his puffed lips if we knew ex-
actly what you wanted we might co-
operate

  loko repeated the sixty-four dollar
question again the others gave us dirty
looks and shoved their fists down to the
hardware at their belts but i was more
interested in hank he had that
thoughtful look on his face it was kind
of hard to figure what the look he had
was due to the swelling i just guessed

  okay hank said in decisive tones
it was like this   

t okos fingers sounded a tatoo on
 the table-top he chewed his upper
queen of the panther world



lip with his lower for a few seconds
then said

  it has the ring of truth this tale you
tell enough to warrant a surety that
in the tale is a greater part of it i know
that oman lurias father was in-
terested in the transmigration of bodies
from one sphere to another though i
didnt know he had gone so far but the
fact remains that it was an experiment
otherwise she would have met you two
still as things stand perhaps she was
busied in other matters   

  one of the dames had cackled in
laughter at the words her laugh was
stilled at the look the old guy shot her
yet it seemed to me that there wasnt
anything in those mild old eyes to make
me shut up that way

  in any event i think we had better
place you in safe custody for the while
captain mita  

  sire

  have these men placed in the cage
on the topmost tier and i shall expect
a vigilant guard to be put over them
they are bait for the beautiful luria

  i got it then it was too late to do
anything about it of course because
even as i turned to give battle one of
the boys behind me jabbed my spine
with his steel tickler and i turned yel-
low like a dandelion in the spring i was
going to be a live coward

  okay wise guy i said you win
as for you you big schmoe this to
the lug who had taken his picks on me
some day you and ill meet under bet-
ter auspices and then  

	 

  the gate clanged shut behind us i
stepped over to the pallet in the corner
and sat on the straw hank stayed close
to the bars his back to me

  might as well take it easy hank i
said this looks like the kind of place
thats going to grow on us we might as
well take it easy like i say we might

be here a long time

  yknow hank said something
funny happened down there when that
guard grabbed me and held my arms be-
hind me i felt as though all i had to do
was twist and hed go flying

  i sat straighter hank too  i
winced as i grinned in reply to some-
thing which had occurred too maybe
the big guy hadnt knocked me cold but
he sure had damaged me a bit

  and that does us good here i said
no nor did it do any good down
there either those stickers they had
carried more weight than our fists its
just something we ought to keep in
mind of course the thing to remember
now is that luria knows were here
she does i guess my voice was a
bit on the sarcastic side he turned like
a shot and stepped to my side i didnt
like the look in his eyes

  listen and get this straight he
snapped i dont want any wrong
cracks about that girl  

  i laughed and waved my hands in a
gesture of good-will just talking
hank i said

  his fingers waved a pattern in front
of my eyes

  so stop talking and listen she said
shed see us here and not to worry
not to worry eh well thats good
to know so what are we supposed to
do while were here count the straws
on the bed

  i dont know she just said not to
worry that shed get to us

t grunted something in disgust
and stretched out on the straw it
got under my shirt collar into my trou-
sers my ears and even in my socks i
thought if she were going to get here
to do it soon a little more of this and
ill go wacky after a bit hank got
tired of supporting the bars and came
down to sit by my side he hummed a


fantastic adventures

snatch of a popular tune it was his way
of being deep in thought me i was also
deep in thought thought of a steak at
guss

  im a bit deaf in one ear and after
listening to that tuneless humming of
hanks for a while i turned my good
ear to the straw and faced the wall the
masonry wasnt in too good a condi-
tion in fact it was cracked and flakes
of grey stuff lay like dandruff on the
surface of the wall i began to peel some
of the stuff it peeled like wallpaper
and like wallpaper some of it stuck
i yanked at it then in anger punched
at it my fist almost went through the
wall

  i yelped in pain and hank turned
to see what had happened one look and
he was crawling to my side

  hey he whispered in excitement
what goes

  i dont know i whispered in re-
turn but this stuffs about as strong
as oatmeal mush have a crack at it
but first put your hanky around your
knuckles

  as i said before hank though a
small man had the muscles and hands
of a carpenter when he slammed his
wrapped fist into that masonry some-
thing gave and it wasnt his hand that
simply disappeared into the wall almost
to his elbow i knelt on the bed behind
him grabbed him about the middle and
yanked backward we fell off the bed
as the hand came out of the wall faster
than we thought

  my god hank said in disgust as
he stared at the hole in the wall are
we dopes theres a ram we could have
used and we go around bustin
knuckles

  i knew what he meant the bed it
had a metal frame in a few seconds
the bed was apart we used the long
metal sides as rams it wasnt more than
a couple of seconds later that light

streamed through the twin holes we
made in the wall what surprised me
was that no one had heard us with all
the racket we were making but i cer-
tainly didnt care dust and bits of stone
fell about us in a grey shower as we
widened the holes into one large hole it
was big enough after a few moments
for the both of us to crawl through
side by side so we did

  we came out on a sort of balcony
since the building was circular the bal-
cony was also circular there was a
ledge perhaps a couple of feet high act-
ing as a break against the straight drop
i peered downward and saw that there
was no escape that way and we had to
escape because the instant we were
through the patrons of this bastille be-
gan a caterwauling of sound that should
have awakened the dead only it wasnt
the dead we were worrying about

  up the roof its our only chance
hank shouted and started up the sill
of the prison wed just quitted

  the wall i saw then was not flat or
smooth there were serrations and
rough spots which were deep in the
stone one didnt have to be an acrobat
to ascend but it would have helped
then we were on the roof

  as far as i could see we hadnt got-
ten anywhere except up but hank had
other thoughts he started at a run for
the far end away from the center i
followed what else was there to do i
saw when we got there why he had
headed for it as i said in the beginning
the buildings were constructed like
pueblos we were looking down at a set-
back that was only a half-story below
us hank being an artist had formed
a picture of what the interior had to be
like from what he saw of the exterior
it was a long jump but we didnt hesi-
tate a second i landed in a heap beside
hank

  instantly we were up and heading for
queen of the panther world



the next set-back we knew the alarm
would not be long in sounding

  we made the second three more to
go i thought as we raced for the third
this time we didnt quite make it there
were many openings on this level and
as we started for the jump-off place
men began to pour from these openings
we ran like scared rabbits but they had
the speed of deer there were some
twenty or thirty waiting for us at the
edge

  we slowed to a walk then to a stop
as usual their stickers were facing our
way

go loko said in wearied tones

    you are strong men prisons do
not hold ye then we shall have to
throw ye into a something which will i
did not want to do what i am going to
unless my hand was forced ye have
forced it throw them into the pit 

  there were a heck of a lot more
guards this time than before our march
to this pit loko spoke of was a regular
processional the whole blamed village
turned out to see us men women and
children i noticed that the tribe was a
tribe of warriors all men women and
children bore arms they were neither
gentle in appearance or manners we re-
ceived the physical manifestations of a
bronx cheer in the parade to the pit i
learned there were many strange and ill-
smelling vegetables on pola some of the
kids threw like a blackwell and with a
bit better aim

  the guards thought it was good fun
until several of them got caught in the
kisser by some bad throws then they
shagged the kids by that time wed
reached the end of the pueblo city the
way led up and down hill for several
miles toward the end of our journey
there were just a few of the villagers
left all women i got a very strong im-
pression that the women were far more

savage than the men there was some-
thing so frightening in their bright
looks as if they would just as soon have
our ends over with on the spot

  we reached our goal at last i know
i breathed a sigh of relief whatever
we had to face in the pit would not be
as frightening as those women of
course i hadnt seen the pit i was to
learn better

  it was a strange pit for it was lo-
cated on a high or a sort of earthen
tower which stuck up like a lonely fin-
ger on the bosom of the plain a long
series of steps wound around the tor
to the very top we were forced to walk
ahead the prodding swords acting as
an incentive at the top we found an-
other series of steps these leading
downward from a platform on the top
i hadnt too much time to observe but
in the few seconds i noticed that the
top of the tor had been leveled flat so
that a great many people could be ac-
commodated on the surface

  as hank and i wound our way down
the face of the tor we noticed that cir-
cular opening had been cut into the
face of the tor our way led evenly be-
tween these openings i became aware
of strange odors bitter-sweet an acrid
stench which turned my stomach the
more i got a whiff of them we could
see before we passed them that these
openings had bars before them odd
muffled sounds were heard once we
were startled out of our wits by a roar-
ing sound which if it did come from
an animal must have been the largest
beast in any world it made a lions roar
sound like mickey mouses squeak

  going up we were close to the face
and going down we were too busy in
the descent but once we reached the
bottom and looked upward we saw how
far we were from the top the blasted
thing looked miles away there were fly
specks on the platform way up there


fantastic adventures

we saw them busying themselves at
something and suddenly there was a
vast clattering sound and the stair down
which wed come reversed itself one
problem was answered if we were to
escape it would not be by way of that
winding staircase

  shall we dance hank asked
yeah i said looking about me
to the dance macabre

pj e saw what i meant the floor of
the huge circular pit was covered
by innumerable stains one glance was
enough to tell us only blood left that
particular stain as if that wasnt
enough the whitened bones of hundreds
of humans were scattered about many
a party had been thrown by the lads
and lassies of lokos menage

  dja notice hank asked that al-
though the sun hasnt stopped shining
for a single second we havent felt any
discomfort

  whats more peculiar i reminded
him is that we have no desire for sleep
im speaking for me of course

  right and im not hungry either
lets hope the zoo isnt hungry i
said

  could be berk he said after a
moments silence we wont get out of
this spot

  speaking of zoos i said wonder
how our friend mokar and his mistress
are making out

  the funniest expression came into
hanks eyes as though hed been
clipped by a phantom punch they
looked dazed words stumbled their
way past his lips

  yes  i hear    we will   
obey  

  i got scared and shook the guy thats
all we needed was for hank to get
screwy on me things were bad enough
he came out of it okay in fact he
grinned quite like his normal self

  what happened another seance
with luria i asked

  yes come on weve got to get to
the center of the arena loko wants us
out of the way his boys will be here
soon

  soon it turned out was that very
moment they must have been right on
our heels suddenly the platform above
was black with people it was impos-
sible to make out the figures of any

  yipe hank howled look

  his quivering finger was pointing up
toward the face of the tor a huge some-
thing was clinging to the sheer wall just
below one of the openings slowly it be-
gan to crawl downward there was
something horrible in that sluggishly
moving shape it moved with infinite
care yet with a surety that was startling
for so large a thing as it neared the
pit we saw it more clearly ive always
wondered what it meant for blood to run
cold i knew then

  it was something from out of a night-
mare to a child versed in the fairy tales
it was a dragon to me it was a prehis-
toric beast it had a great triangular
head and a massive body which was
scaled from the head to the long tail
wisps of smoke trailed from its nostrils
i crowded close to hank as though in
mutual protection and he in turn be-
gan a slow retreat to the point farthest
from where the beast would land

  god it must have stretched a good
fifty feet the great head split and from
the many-rowed teeth came a terrible
stench a roar split the silence of the
pit as it shook its head from side to side
then it saw us and began a cumbrous
movement in our direction we kept re-
treating until our backs were against
the granite of the wall it followed re-
lentlessly surely

  you run one way hank breathed
heavily ill run the other

  perhaps the beast had been used to
queen of the panther world



easier prey for as we split up and ran
for the opposite wall it stood still its
head moving from side to side as if in
wonderment at our sudden disappear-
ance when it finally did move it was
with express train speed the murderous
tail swishing about in a vicious swing

 nce more we faced it together but
this time from the opposite wall
we knew however that the respite we
had gained was small no matter how
many times we ran from it we had no
place to go except in a circle and soon
or late we would have to stop from
sheer exhaustion then 

  once more it lumbered toward us
and again we broke for the other wall
we were breathing a bit heavily as we
faced the beast again the faint echo of
shrieking voices reached our ears and
we involuntarily looked upward we
groaned in unison when we saw the rea-
son for the shouting they had let an-
other of the horrors at us we could see
the huge body crawling down the gran-
ite wall

  run berk a voice screamed in
my ear

  we had forgotten the beast as we
had looked upward it had moved for-
ward hank spotting it first he leaped
to safety but i wasnt that lucky the
very tip of the tail caught me as i tried
to leap to one side and sent me sprawl-
ing i said the beast had the speed of a
train when it moved i was barely on
my feet when it was on me

  i had fallen close by a pile of bones
stooping i picked a thigh bone from
the pile and swinging it like a bat i
let the thing have it right across its ugly
fire-spitting snout surely there was no
hope or reason for my act but i wasnt
going to go down without at least one
blow in my defense no matter how puny
it was

  i could only stare open-mouthed as

the beast snorted loudly and retreated
from me with a wild yell spouting from
my lips i followed it belaboring it
across the snout with my bone-bat
hank seeing what was taking place
came to my assistance we were laugh-
ing i guess in hysteria at the way
things were going when it happened
we had forgotten that damned tail

  one sudden swish and we were both
knocked from our feet and this time
there were two of them at us the sec-
ond had arrived to the festive board
their mouths were big enough to take
us in at a single gulp i had time for
one prayer as i tried to gain my feet

  i swear their teeth were inches away
when that terrific wind came up my
senses started to reel i couldnt move
a muscle not even an eyelid there was
this wind and this black cloud that
came from nowhere my ears rang with
a shout    lura and blackness
enfolded me in a comforting blanket

t erk berk

    wind was sweeping past me in
a constant wave it cooled my sweaty
brow there was a strange up-and-down
movement i opened my eyes-and
grabbed tightly at what lay beneath
me

  you okay kid hank asked

  he was directly ahead of me in fact
so close we were twins on mokars back
hanks right arm was about lurias
waist she had saved us from the very
mouths of our doom i didnt care how
she did it nor was i interested in fact
i didnt have time to worry about the
fact that we were riding on the back of
a panther i only knew i was alive it
was enough for me

  but after a few moments of this
pounding run i began to sit up and take
notice for one thing mokar was run-
ning so smoothly in such marvelous
bounds that the action was slick as oil


fantastic adventures

for another thing the surroundings were
exotic in the extreme

  we were in the midst of jungleland
the trees were magnificent in their
height and variety birds of brilliant-
colored plumage sang from bush and
branch the air was invigorating and
surprisingly free of humidity mokar
was sure-footed his lithe shape never
disturbed a single branch as he moved
along an invisible trail luria sat high
up on his body close to the muscled
shoulders she was clothed in the same
sort of costume i saw on the warrior
women by lokos side a slender
needle-tipped spear was couched along
one elbow she looked straight ahead

  the jungle ended abruptly and we
entered a grassy plain set in gently roll-

ing hills mokars pace never slackened
though our weight must have been con-
siderable even for him the miles flew
by in endless procession then with a
suddenness that took my breath away
while we were in the midst of what
looked like bundles of straw hundreds
of shapes came to life

  the bundles of what i thought had
been straw were humans and not a
single one of them was a man i didnt
hear luria give voice to any command
yet mokar slowed his pace and after a
very short while stopped running al-
together luria slid from his back and
hank and i followed although more
gingerly in an instant we were sur-
rounded by the hundreds of chattering
women theyre the same all over the
queen of the panther world

instant you give them a chance to yat-
tete they start full blast

  ill say this for luria she didnt give
them too much opportunity to work
their jaws on talk her arm with the
spear held high shot up and silence fell
among the warrior-women as they
gathered close i looked them over
there were short ones tall ones slim
ones and fat ones beauties and ugly
ones calm ones and those whose eyes
looked fierce enough to frighten boris
karloff in other words they looked no
different than those on the planet wed
quitted what seemed like years before

xjot all were giving luria attention
  there were some who stole glances
at us there was one in particular she

was rather tall certainly taller than i
whose hair was the color of molten gold
whose eyes were sapphires swimming
in a sea of pearl her bosom rose high
and well-formed in the breastplate she
wore and as she saw my admiring
glance her breath quickened and her
face flushed i made a mental note that
if the time ever came for talk id for-
get to

  luria nodded for us to step to her
side then as the others faced us luria
began to talk

  these are the ones i promised to
bring the secret my father the great
oman taught me has been put to use
but as he warned i could not bring
other than their bodies more i could
not foresee the placc of their arrival


fantastic adventures

  so misfortune came to them one of
lokos bands found them before i could
reach them and brought them before
the tyrant warriors loko threw them
into the pit

  a gasp of horror went up at the
words

  yes luria went on into the pit
strangers on the planet of pola loko
violated again the holiest words of my
father oh that he were alive  

  mighty oman may his soul leave
the place of its abode and help us the
women intoned solemnly

  hank and i kept stealing puzzled
glances at each other but our curiosity
had to contain itself we knew that a
lot of answers would soon be given

       his thousand years of reign
brought pola a great peace after the
tens of thousands of years of wars now
loko has it in mind to break that peace
he has even enlisted the aid of
men   

  this time the womens voices rose
in a vast shout of anger and once more
luria went on

       aye men like hostal and
mita and others of his ilk that was
why i went out of our time and place
into another to bring back the sex
which once ruled our men have grown
soft to the ways of war they have
grown soft because the years have made
them that way look at the weapons of
our fighting swords spears and knives
but we are fortunate loko and his min-
ions have no choice in this matter we
must prevent loko and his from gain-
ing the upper hand else we all become
slaves to his will   

  it was all going in one ear and out
the other but not hank he got it right
away i was just in time to see the heat
of anger come to his eyes and face but
not in time to stop him whirling swift-
ly he puled luria about until she was
facing him

  so thats why you brought me here
as a guinea pig as a symbol for these
lysystratas of yours   

  luria didnt take his fingers from her
wrist instead she motioned for the
other dames to halt at the very touch
of hanks fingers swords flashed in the
bright sunlight and bodies tensed

  did you think it was because of your
manly beauty she asked or because
of your charm

  hanks fingers fell away from her
wrist the flush of anger still lighted
his lean long face but there was a tinge
of frustration in his eyes perhaps he
had assumed it might have been because
of some such reasons

  i brought you here you and this
ugly wart of a man whom you call
friend because you were the vessel in
which the fluid of my fathers wisdom
coagulated only you heard the call
and because this berk was your friend
did i allow him with you   

  okay babe hank said evenly
you called we answered now i dont
like the set-up so suppose you send us
right back to the place you got us
from

  you pout prettily luria said
how like must this earth be to our
planet here too the men pout if we
do not give them their way

j damned her and could have
kicked hank he kept opening his
yap and she kept putting her foot in it

  yes i said we have all the man-
ners of men but i gather you are not
too well-acquainted with all the ways
perhaps its in the cards that youre
going to learn

  aah he gives a twist to words and
has no fear that they will rebound to
confound him luria said turning her
attention to me

  i didnt care there wasnt a dame
alive on this or any planet i couldnt
queen of the panther world



argue with or against

  yep i have no fear only in your
tears do you have immunity  

  tears do you take me for a man

  i gave her a slow up-and-down this
time it was she who burned bright red
i knew my look was an insult id al-
ready figured the score if we were play-
ing lysystrata then the boy friends and
husbands of these amazons were weak-
kneed neutrals

  not the way you stack up kid i
said

  i guess it was insult direct only the
answer to it came from an unexpected
corner my head rocked from a blow
and i staggered a bit before i recovered
my balance when my head cleared i
saw it was the luscious dish whom id
been admiring who stood facing me

  it is not meet that our leader whose
toes you are too low to touch should
deal you the punishment you deserve
but i who am the smallest of her serv-
ants can   

  these babes sure could yell all they
needed was one of their number to open
up and they were ready with the howl-
ing i looked at luria who had a half-
grin on her lips

  teach the little toad a lesson luria
said

  hey i called in protest as an im-
mense circle formed about us i cant
hit a woman

  and once more my head rocked as she
planted one right on the jawbone well
woman or no she wasnt playing for
fun i stepped back danced around a
bit to loosen up my leg muscles put
up my dukes and whammm something
hit me with the force of a mules kick

  berk a voice called from a long
distance off get up dont let her look
like a champ  

  there were ten suns up there and a
million women at least then my head
cleared and there was that beautiful pan

looking down at me i motioned for her
to step back and got to my feet

  okay kiddo i said snuffling the
claret back up my nostrils you asked
for it come and get it

  then bing bing bing faster than the
telling takes she let me have it

  gosh i thought they got the sweet-
est-singing birds out here and angels
too my what a place just like heaven
and once more that voice called me i
was beginning to dislike mister sharpe
why didnt he take a couple of lumps
was i supposed to take them all

  the birds i thought i heard was the
strident sound of all those bags yelling
and the angels faces were not so an-
gelic once my vision cleared my knees
were on the wobbly side my glamour-
puss could hit like louis i assayed a
grin but yipped in pain instead

  enough the dear girl asked

 shook my head im a stubborn
dope in some ways but the memorp
of the giant whod taken his picks on
me had come to mind and suddenly i
wanted to haul off at something

  i motioned her forward with beckon-
ing fingers this time i got there just
instead of hitting with my right i
closed the beckoning fingers of my left
hand and jabbed her right on the point
of her stubborn chin her head went
back and my right came over but with
all i had on it there was a sharp
crack and baby went sailing through
the air to land on a pillow of grass some
fifteen feet from where we were bat-
tling

  they proved they were the opposite
sex then their voices rose like ban-
shees on the prowl and with a single
concerted howl they made for me nor
were they joking they had those three-
feet long stickers out and aimed right
for hank and myself again luria
stopped them


fantastic adventures

  halt are we men that we attack
like animals besides lovah has not
signified defeat

  i cursed the day id ever seen this
woman the day id ever met henry
sharpe and most of all the day i went
to the zoo with him now i was on a
spot this lovah could just be that
stubborn as not to give up easily

  several of the gals had gone to lo-
vahs assistance the kid was on the
wobbly side as they brought her for-
ward my punch had raised a lump on
the side of her jaw and her eyes didnt
quite have that superior look as she
tried to look into mine

  better take it easy kid i said
picking my words carefully theres
no sense in beating each other silly
youre far too pretty to get messed
up   

  i guess it was the first time anyone
had called her pretty though why not
was a mystery to me she could make
my breakfast any morning of the week

  her left hand came up and caressed
the swelling and her eyes became a lot
more natural and something of specu-
lation showed in the deep blue i held
my breath waiting for her answer i
blew it out in a deep sigh when she
said

  enough  for the while lovah
said

  only luria was smart enough to get
the game id played

  you are clever with words she
said and this time there was no scorn
in her voice well call your mounts
enough time has been wasted   

  it was a command which was in-
stantly obeyed a tuneless whistling
went up and like black demons called
from their pits hundreds of black pan-
thers much like mokar in appearance
though none so large rose as though
from the very ground they loped for-
ward and the women mounted them

lovah gestured for me to step to her
side i did and she motioned for me to
mount behind her then at a signal from
luria who had again taken hank be-
hind her we were off

  say beautiful i said as we started
you got a wallop whats more you got
a whole lot more that appeals to
me  

  she turned and looked deeply into
my eyes her face became oddly soft
then with the speed of light it changed
and as she drove her elbow into my
belly knocking the wind from me she
said

  you got a wallop too  

a t first i thought it was suburbia

     at least a real-estate agents dream
development they called it gayno but
it could have been the community of el
rancho grande for all of me it was a
community of well-laid-out homes all
single-storied with the most modern
architectural designs sloping roofs
glass walls patios and terraces to take
advantage of shade and sun gave it the
house beautiful look

  when we were still several hundred
yards from the village of homes the
women lifted their voices in a sort of
musical chant it was the first i knew
their voices could be soft and charm-
ingly feminine then as we swept into
the level grass-filled width of street a
host of men and children came from the
houses and followed us to one set apart
from the rest luria in the lead drew
mokar up to the shallow series of steps
leading to the door of the house and
dismounted lovah kicked her panther
beside mokar and with a well-placed
blow of her elbow knocked me from
the animal as she wheeled him around
she turned her face to me and winked
broadly

i sighed deeply and got to my feet
and walked to the side of hank and the
queen of the panther world



girl i had an idea that this lovah baby
wasnt too displeased with me

  well come in luria said

  the other women scattered as we fol-
lowed the girl into the house if i
thought the exteriors of the homes
looked like something out of house
beautiful the interiors took my breath
away wow two-level interiors with
an incline leading to a combination din-
ing and living room on the second story
the first floor had four walls of colored
glass which softened the suns rays and
gave them a subdued and marvelous
brilliance which somehow did not hurt
the eyes there was a wondrous air of
peace and serenity in this house

  luria slumped wearily into a deep-
piled chair after throwing off her belt
and helmet there were a couple of
sofas facing each other across a gigantic
coffee table hank and i sat side by side
on one so that we were in profile to
the girl to our left was a raised fire-
place of colored stones above it on
the mantle were some statuary primi-
tives from the looks of them at sight
of them hank arose and examined them
closely

  say these are truly wonderful
who was the carver

  one of my servants luria said in
answer but her mind was elsewhere
she shook her head after a second or
so looked up to hank and said care
for a beverage

  sure i said make mine scotch
and water

  hank was still deep in study of the
small statue he turned and said
servant wtiy thats criminal some-
one with a positive talent for creative
work someone with the ability of this
person whoever he may be should cer-
tainly not be a servant

  sit down luria said it wasnt said
in anger but rather in an almost suppli-
cating tone

tt ank sat deep in a corner of the
wide sofa to my surprise she
walked around the arm of the sofa past
the coffee table and faced us she
studied us for a second then spoke

  you are strangers here in a strange
land among strange people who have
strange customs i dont have any
doubts but that you will both have to
spend the rest of your natural lives
here my father discovered the secret
of transmigration of bodies but it is
still a mystery to me how he returned
them

  therefore i beg of both of you to
take what i have to say to heart there
should be a beginning i know but that
beginning goes back into an antiquity
greater and more distant than any you
know i saw a something in your eyes
the instant you entered my home i
think i interpreted it correctly you
both marveled that you should find
something approximating your own civ-
ilized world after a visit to the world
of loko

  then let me start from there for
it is in that you might best understand
here you have a ready comparison
this land of gayno and lokos world
further when my father lived there
were better worlds finer cities greater
cultures but death came to him as it
must come to all and though he lived
to be eleven hundred and sixty-four
years  

  i couldnt help it eleven hundred
and sixty-four years i grunted an un-
intelligible something she caught on
fast

  unbelievable isnt it that one can
live so many years she asked

  hank got the connotation of her re-
mark before i did he squinted at her
and said

and i suppose youre in your   

  i am nine hundred and twenty-four
years old she said


fantastic adventures

  pretty well-preserved for your age
id say i said

  lovah is almost a thousand years
old she said

  i thought that was nasty of her but
it was like a woman i grinned weakly
touch i said

  lets get back to your father hank
suggested

  very well she replied in the last
forty years of my fathers reign a small
border clash became a conflagration
which set all of pola aflame he did not
know it at the time but there were some
who were envious of his power they
plotted his downfall and overcame his
legions it turned into a war of utter
annihilation when it was over there
was nothing left of culture civilization
or people here and there were scat-
tered the fragments of humanity

  they went back to living as they
had done thousands of years ago they
had to do this because my father in his
great wisdom realizing the finality of
the battle doomed the terror weapons
of the time and erased their marks for-
ever we the offspring of that terrible
time had only the means you see of
waging war a sword a spear and a
knife

  so we had to make the best of
things for my people i chose the stand-
ard of living which best suited our time
i utilized the forms of home architec-
ture which because of the constant sun-
light would be most suitable but as i
said before we were scattered over the
entire face of pola loko who was the
ringleader and the only one of the inner
council to survive the war went back
even further in antiquity for the plans
of his community but he wasnt inter-
ested in how his people lived he still
had it in mind and to this day is ob-
sessed by his overweening desire to be
the ruler of the planet of pola   

che paused for a breath and in that
moment i thought baby you got a
right to tell some one else theyre clever
with words you dont have to take a
back seat to anybody when it comes to
making with the lip

  aside from the physical manifesta-
tions of what transpired with berk and
myself hank spoke up like a good
scientist there are certain questions
which are bothering me i would appre-
ciate it very much if an answer were
forthcoming

  now then i believe i am assuming
correctly when i say that pola and the
planet from which we have come are
existing in the same spheres of time and
place 

  oh boy i thought good old sharpe
now hes going to make like he knows
what hes talking about of course hank
always had a sharp mind if im allowed
a pun he was proving it now

  luria answered the question in the
seconds i was in thought

  that is right

  well hank said in a speculative
tone that proved a theory which some
men have always held now another
question how is it you speak in fact
all the people we have met speak our
tongue english

  luria smiled and arose and walked
to a near wall a heavy ribbon-like cord
hung against the wall she puled at it
and from somewhere in the house a
bell sounded in answer to the bell-pull
she came back to the sofa and snuggled
up in a corner

  the tongue we speak is universal on
pola she said the instant you landed
you too spoke our tongue

  it wasnt a satisfactory answer but i
supposed it had to do hank wasnt
through however

  that doesnt make sense try this
what is the groana bird and why is it
holy
queen of the panther world



  we had to wait for the answer to that
a husky masculine voice said
greatness   you rang

  we turned and there was a man who
wearing a sort of lavalava for a cos-
tume his hairy chest was bare as were
his legs muscles rippled along the
shoulders and arms and as he bent his
legs knotted with muscles he was close
to six feet in height

  yes hioa luria said my guests
are thirsty   

  he shook his head and as silently as
he had come left

  all your men servants hank
asked

  she nodded if not so in fact in
theory she replied

  a nation of women i said all
wrong

  by earthly standards she said
turning to me but as i said in the be-
ginning you must understand our cus-
toms are not as yours here the women
are the rulers men have only a minor
part in the business of state

  i was tempted to ask something but
i didnt think it to be the time

      only loko has changed those
conditions of servitude luria went on
since the dawn of the new era women
took over the duties which men served
so dishonorably before all went well
until loko thought the time ripe se-
cretly he trained his minions in the arts
of war and when he thought the time
was ripe began his campaign he has
a clever tongue not only did he manage
to train the men of his tribe but he also
convinced the warrior women of the
federation it was only for the purpose
of waging war upon me that he did so
and that when he had defeated me he
would relegate them to their former
positions

  and the groana bird hank asked
again

  the groana bird is the symbol by

which we will conquer luria said it
is the most ancient of all living beings
on pola it holds the secret of all things
it means success or failure once it sat
on my fathers right hand now it roams
free and unfettered in the forest we
all seek it and find it i must even if
i have to go into the valley of the
mists  

tvt y ears pricked up at the sound
of a screaming voice i thought
i was mistaken but the voice sounded
masculine the screaming came closer
then another voice joined it this one
raised in anger and this one decidedly
feminine hank and the girl heard the
sounds also an expression of displeas-
ure crossed her face she rose and start-
ed down the ramp hank and i followed

  we arrived at the front door simul-
taneously luria hank i and the two
who were screaming luria flung the
door wide and a giant of a man sprawled
to his knees before her behind him
some few feet came a short scrawny
woman who held in one hand a thick
club

  ohh greatness   the character
on his knees babbled save me from
haavah save me  

  the women skidded to halt before
us the sounds of the screaming had
brought others to their doors i could
see children huddled close to their fath-
ers knees from the houses closest to
ours several women strolled over in
curiosity but at sight of the guy on his
knees before us and the scrawny babe
who was standing with the club hanging
limply from one hand smiles broke on
their lips it was evident this story was
not new to them

  now what is it jimno luria
asked in disgust

  haavah the man babbled in a bass
voice which ezio pinza would have been
proud to possess she beats me  i


fantastic adventures

swear i have done nothing to deserve
the beatings  

  he lies the idiot the woman said
in his teeth ten years we have been
together a simple thing like soup and
he burns it it has become unbearable
i awake and it takes him a lifetime to
make breakfast our children are the
worst-dressed in the whole village all
he wants to do is sing   

  now aint that too bad i said be-
fore luria could say anything all he
wants to do is sing eh well maybe we
shouldnt waste sympathy on him after
all hes so big and youre so small im
sure if he ever decided to give you
your lumps youd be in bed for a
week of course he might have a bit of
peace 

  quiet luria spat at me in anger
i give the orders and dispense the jus-
tice in these cases

  sure hank said close your trap
if we ever tell these characters that
theyre living in a fools paradise theyll
tear these women limb from limb   
i swear that beautiful face turned
livid in anger she turned on hank and
slapped him right across the cheek he
went pale in anger and i saw his hands
clench into bony fists for the barest
second i thought he was going to haul
off and slug her how he held back from
doing it i dont know im sure i
couldnt have instead he turned on his
heels and went back into the house it
was a mistake because i observed that
the guy on his knees had been watching
there was a bright light in his eyes
when hank talked up like he did but
when hank did the disappearing act
the light died

  the anger in lurias face went into
her voice

  haavah we are becoming weary of
this constant strife between you and
jimno if it is true what you say and
that you are as tired of it as you say

then haul him up before the bar of
justice and have them sentence jimno
to the breaking of paarans to the
halter  

a change came over the womans
face at lurias words it reflected
fear and horror now

  great luria the woman bleated
not that

  and why not luria asked he is
of little use to you further he causes
nothing but trouble he sings when he
should be doing the housework he
burns the soup lets the children run
ragged and uncared for is lazy and a
dozen other things you will be better
rid of him  

  and he of her i put in

  but    the paavans they have
killed some who have tried to break
them to the halter  

  so hell have a chance to prove hes
either man or mouse i said certainly
hes big enough as a man hm if i had
you for a wife id know whod do the
housework and care for the kids we
teach women differently on earth  

  how is it done on earth the man
asked suddenly he was still on his
knees but his body was erect and he
was looking straight at me so stunned
were the two women by jimnos temer-
ity in speaking to me without asking
their permission they could only stare

  shed fit just right over your knee
i said quickly a couple of smacks
with one of those palms and shed be-
have believe me   

  quiet you luria stormed

  but haavah wielded a more efficient
means of silence she raised her club
and clouted jimno across the back of
the head a ripple of laughter ran across
the narrow circle which had formed
about the woman and her husband as
the man folded up in middle and sank
face downward to the ground
queen of the panther world



  take him away luria said to the
paavans compound let him break six
of the beasts to the halter

  suddenly i felt sick me and my big
mouth what had i done maybe i
had sentenced a man to death anger
whipped my voice to a frenzied shout
so this is the stuff from which you
want us to weld a fighting force and
how do you expect us to work it by the
women whipping their men to us
from the corner of my eye i saw the
man stir shake his head and slowly get
to his feet only i got the air of ominous
quiet with which he moved the rest
watched him arise and an air of watch-
ful waiting settled among the women
dimly i felt someone standing by the
door behind us at the same time i real-
ized that other doorways hid other
watchers

  the woman called haavah waited
only until jimno stood erect then with
a movement that was altogether at vari-
ance with her scrawny self she leaped
forward and swung the club at the same
time

  man oh man if i had ever been
slugged like that i know id never have
been able to duck that club but he did
then like a boxer whod been hit hard
and wanted to weather the storm he
ducked and weaved under and past the
swinging club the women thought the
whole thing the funniest thing theyd
ever seen they laughed as the poor guy
ducked and once or twice they literally
screamed in hysteria as the club barely
missed the curly black hair

  when he did move it was with the
speed of a striking snake one second
he was under the club the next his
fingers had wrapped themselves around
it with one twist it was pulled from
her he chuckled deep in his throat as
he tossed it to one side he motioned
her forward she didnt come so he
stepped toward her i yelled a warning

as her hand sped to her belt but he
was speed personified as his hand beat
hers to it he twisted with an effortless
movement of his wrist and her hand fell
from the belt

  it was his free hand which went
toward the belt now i saw a dozen
hands go for weapons as his fingers
went about the circle of leather he
yanked downward and the leather
parted this too he tossed to one side
all the while his right hand held her
wrist prisoner

  ten years haavah his voice lifted
in a singing shout ten years  

tll say this her face showed not
the smallest sign of fear as he
whirled her so that her back was to him
then he had lifted her from her feet and
dropping to one knee he laid her across
that knee she squirmed like a fish in a
net and like that same fish found all her
squirming without avail his hand lifted
and fell palm downward it lifted and
fell at first there was no sound but the
heavy breathing of the two but after
the tenth whack on the womans poste-
rior a whimper fled her lips the whim-
per became a moan which later became
a sobbing sound it was strange but not
a woman stirred or spoke while he was
administering the spanking nor did
any lift a voice when he was done and
said

  go woman and prepare me food

  jimno stood tall and proud and faced
his queen

  the sentence still stands jimno
she said haavah will cook and keep
your house afterward beating her
proves nothing

  it proves he is a man i said

  not by your standards my women
and i too have broken the paavans to
the halter let him go and try to do it
then we can talk of manhood   
fantastic adventures

  what is a paavan i asked
  mokar is a paavan  

  i turned and without a word went
back into the house i saw a shape slide
into a passageway i only got a glimpse
of the figure it was that of a man and
the man was hioa

  hank was deep in the sofa cuddled
up against one arm he didnt hear me
come in what with the depth of the car-
pet and for another thing he was deep
in thought i slid into the opposite chair
and waited for him to come out of his
brown study

  his eyes were bleak and bitter when
he finally did turn nice going shar-
pe he said aloud but he wasnt talk-
ing to me he was talking to himself
now you can join the rest of the
eunuchs   

  aah cut it out i said in disgust
what the heck makes you that way
the gals nuts about you

  sure just like that scrawny dame
was about her man lurias probably
been figuring in what womanly capacity
id do best well if she thinks im going
to cook or scrub floors 

  i knew there was one way of break-
ing hank from his thoughts he wasnt
the kind of guy who looked good play-
ing cry-baby for one thing he was too
big a man and i dont mean in size but
we had undergone a very strange and
mystifying ordeal not that im such a
big joe about something like that its
just that im thicker-skinned besides
i had some long range plans most of
which had to do with a lovah gal   
so i gave him the business about my
troubles

     you got worries i broke in
your worries i should have   
what do you mean

  i just sentenced a guy to maybe his
death

  huh

  sure i made with a yuck and those

screwy dames or rather that screwy
dame luria sentenced the poor joe to
break mokars buddies to the halter
she would hank said sourly
yeah and after he gave that silly
frau of his a good tanning i said

  you mean the guy stood up for his
rights

  that he did

  hm then maybe all hope is not
lost wheres luria

  dont ask me i had to walk away
from it all

  what do you want her voice
asked from the direction of the ramp

  one thing only my pet hank said
what is it you want of us exactly
just one thing teach my menfolk
how to battle

  okay but first teach your menfolk
how to be men hank said

  and that was that for the evening or
morning or whatever time it was in that
land of eternal sun  

np here were twin beds in the sleep-
ing rooms luria had given us hank
and i slept in our undies when we
awoke we awoke to find the rest of our
garments gone in their places were
breastplates and helmets such as cap-
tain mita and the other men in lokos
world wore we even had the long and
short stickers to go in the belt that came
with the metal apron that went over
the short pants

  she doesnt miss a trick hank said
wearily as he stepped into the modern
bathroom adjoining our bedroom i
heard the splashing sound of water but
i was too engrossed in putting on the
uniform which had been provided for
me nor was it a bad fit the only thing
large was the breastplate of course i
realized after a try-on they werent
meant for a man

  the bathroom had everything but
razors my beard which is of a dark
queen of the panther world



texture anyway hadnt known a blades
touch for several days in fact from the
looks of it for a week i remembered
then that the few men id seen were
either smooth-shaven or were hairless
on the face hank gave a last sputter
and stepped up from the sunken shower
he was rubbing himself with a fuzzy
towel

  aint none i looked guess no one
shaves out here how do they fit

  i did a double-take at the words then
grinned at him he had guessed at my
tardiness i told him and he answered
my grin

  oh well go on take your shower
ill see you later

  he wasnt in the room when i came
back neither was his war garb i
donned mine and stepped out into the
passage leading to the ramp here the
bedrooms were on the lower floor the
two of them were already eating when
i arrived hank gave me an okay sign
with his thumb and index fingers but
the girl didnt even look up we ate in
silence

  well she said after a last drink
of something that looked like coffee but
tasted like something else only better
now that were awake suppose we get
started

  you bet i said and what does
your greatness want us to do

     when we get there she threw
over her shoulder as she started for the
door

  i gulped audibly when i saw what
was awaiting us mokar and two of his
brothers luria mounted her beast and
looked to us hank and i did an al-
ponse-gaston act for a couple of sec-
onds then with ill-concealed reluctance
stepped to the sides of our mounts
those darned animals must have sensed
our fear as i started to lift my leg he
turned his head and showed me his
fangs

  they were very pretty i wondered
who his dentist was as i shied but fast
from the spot i was in hank on the
other hand had a lot more guts than i
wanted to have when his mount tried
to pull a similar stunt hank cracked
him over the nose the beasts head
came up and sideways hank slapped
him again and jerked at the halter in-
stantly the panther obeyed then hank
slid in the saddle

  and that left me on the ground

  oh come now nimble-tongue
luria needled me we cant spend all
day here

  we cant i parried beautifully

  she looked past me and i turned to
follow her glance directly behind us
were a dozen of the biggest women ive
ever seen not a single one was under
six feet in height and all were armed-
as though in answer to a signal one of
them jabbed at me with one of those
ten feet-long spears they carried it
barely touched me but that tip had a
needle for a point i yipped in pain and
alarm then with a single leap i was
in the shallow saddle teeth or no teeth
that spear was sharper

  we hadnt far to go and after a while
i got to rather like the ride those pan-
thers ran like the wind and the move-
ment didnt have the up-and-down feel-
ing of a horseback ride our destination
was a valley the valley was natural but
it had been fenced in by a staked fence
there was a gate at the end we had
arrived at one of the warrior women
dismounted and opened it we rode in
and found ourselves on a wide ledge
overlooking the sheer drop to the almost
circular valley below

t looked about and saw that a
long series of steps had been cut
into the stone below us something was
taking place which caught and held my
attention at the far end of the valley


fantastic adventures

i made out the shapes of four panthers
coming toward them were a dozen
women these women were armed with
spears behind them unarmed walked
jimno we could hear the women crying
to the panthers telling them to take it
easy the animals suddenly broke and
raced around the valley floor not all
of them i saw after a second one of
them had been cornered and for the
first time  saw what jimno carried in
his arms a bridle and halter

  i gasped when i realized what he was
going to do place them about the pan-
thers throat i watched breathlessly
his approach the only thing the women
did were hold the panther at bay with
their spears jimno had to do the dirty
work and it was more than just dirty
it was dangerous the beast snarled
and showed its teeth but ill say this
for the man he walked in like it was a
big tabby he was going to pet

  suddenly there was a swirl of motion
queen of the panther world



a small cloud of dust arose when it
cleared we saw that jimno had succeed-
ed in placing the halter where it be-
longed but his task was half-done now
he had to ride the panther like a cen-
taur jimno leaped onto the animals
back kicked him in the ribs and began
to work the reins the animal snarled
turned his head to get at the mans feet
but was only rewarded by slaps across
its nostrils and kicks in the ribs i was
reminded of a cowboy breaking in a

bronc and to carry the simile further
jimno rode the panther back and forth
across the floor of the valley until the
panther obeyed the slightest touch of
the reins and of the feet

  the second and third beasts broke in
as easily as the first the fourth was
another story it was easily the largest
of the four animals even larger i think
than mokar it slapped the spears once
knocking down the woman who held one
of them if the others hadnt rushed to


fantastic adventures

her defense he would have torn her limb
from limb

  jimno had better be careful with
this one luria said he shows a wild
spirit

  jimno must have realized it also his
steps were far more careful he walked
daintily as though on eggs the circle
of spears opened to let him through
sensing the helplessness of the man the
beast whirled to face him someone
nearby was breathing in harsh throaty
gasps it was me 

  down below the drama was becom-
ing more tense jimno moved forward
slowly carefully the beast retreated
until at last its back was against the
wall then jimno did something strange
he paused when only a few feet from
the panther shook his head and dropped
the gear he was carrying he paused
there erect and unafraid then stepped
forward instantly as though the beast
had been awaiting jimnos action he
reared upward its front legs with those
terrible claws open and jimno walked
straight forward into the embrace

  i tried to yell tried to get something
past the sandpaper which had suddenly
lined my throat but nothing came out
even in the midst of terror in circum-
stances which seem to hold ones entire
attention there is part of one that is
separate from the rest so it was i some-
how saw hanks and the girls reaction
to what was going on below

  hanks face was rigid livid with the
tense expectation of what was sure to
happen to jimno and horror-stricken
that he couldnt help luria too showed
emotion hers rather was like a surgeon
in an operating amphitheatre watching
a fellow surgeon at work

  below jimno walked into the pan-
thers embrace but not to his death
as we were imagining i dont know how
he did it but suddenly jimno ducked
he must have ducked a split second be-

fore the beast slashed at him but jimno
ducked the blow and like light jimno
used both hands to grasp the panther
by the fur at the shoulder then setting
his feet hard in the earth jimno swung
the panther about and leaped on its
back

t couldnt help letting out a wild
yell of delight nor was hank far
behind me with his cheer even lurias
eyes shone in admiration for jimno
now had the panther at a disadvantage
he was on the beasts back his fingers
deep in thefur his legs wound around
the beasts belly jimnos right hand
came up and delivered a terrific slap
across the panthers face the beast
reared his fore claws and legs trying to
swipe in futile swings at the man on its
back the more the beast clawed the
harder jimno slapped at last jimno
won out with a last vicious blow jim-
no slid from the panthers back and
walked nonchalantly to where the
women were standing

  he walked with his shoulders square
and his back straight and when he came
into their midst he didnt walk around
them but moved as though they had
better give him room else hed walk
right over them they moved out of his
way all right

  he marched up the long flight of
stairs saw us and came forward to
stand before luria

  greatness he said the deed
to which i was sentenced has been
done  

  and well-done luria said graci-
ously truly you are a man one
worthy of carrying arms jimno tell
me would you care to be the first of
the legions of men i am going to re-
cruit

  i would be honored

  good in the future you and haavah
will share equally the burdens and joys
queen of the panther world



of your lives if she lays a hand to you
you have my express authority to strike
back  

  i realized i was hearing history being
made these men though not eunuchs
performed the same functions

     so be it with you jimno and
all men hear me my lieutenants from
this day henceforth all men share and
share alike the burdens and joys of
women on our return spread the news
to the entire community go you
hank and berk stay with me i have
things to tell   

  she waited until the others had left
then dismounted from mokar and
walked to the lip of the valley and sat
on a grassy hummock hank and i fol-
lowed and sat beside her

      i was awake all night she said
sleep would not come to me my mind
kept turning over and over again on the
dilemna we are in it is not an easy
thing to admit defeat before it comes
yet defeat is undeniable

  why hank asked

  she tossed her head and her hair
shook free in gleaming waves about her
face

  we are too few loko has not alone
the majority of the tribes but the very
ones who have kept up a semblance of
the war-like proclivities of their prede-
cessors we are their superiors in spirit
but in war spirit alone is not enough
so hank was doing one of those
single-syllable deals with her i knew
it was irritating her because it was irri-
tating me of course  knew the reason
for it she didnt

  i have tride to find a way out but
the only one i can think of is to go to
loko and acknowledge his claim and
throw myself on his mercy

  if thats the way you feel hank
said

  i hid a grin in my palm she was get-
ting a little flushed in her cheeks spots

of color burned below her eyes and her
eyes were beginning to flash in anger
her right hand lying on the grass close
to me clenched in a small and capable
fist

  okay then hank said since that
is the way you feel send us back

  her hand came down in a slap at the
earth her lips set firm and hard against
each other

  very well she said i wont hold
you here against your wishes as soon
as we get back  

e saw the smudge of smoke
lying low on the horizon when we
were barely past the first hill lurias
eyes widened at the odd sight than nar-
rowed in sudden understanding i guess
i was the last to catch on and so was
the last to urge my beast to greater
speed i dont think we were very far
from gayno when we saw a horde of
humans and animals coming toward us
in the lead mounted on a magnificent
panther was jimno

  we drew rein and waited for the ar-
rival of the first of the mob jimno
leaped from the back of his mount
dashed over to us and stood silent his
great chest heaving in panting breath
we saw then that he had suffered a
number of wounds one of them a wide
slash from a sharp instrument that had
cut through the surface flesh all the way
across the chest blood dripped from
the wound but jimno seemed com-
pletely unaware of it

   loko he gasped after a second
he turned as the first of the hundreds
of men women and children streamed
up then brought his attention back to
us lokos minions attacked while we
were in the valley of the paavans it
was a surprise and before a defense
could be organized they had set fire to
the whole of the city they were too
many and the surprise was too great


fantastic adventures

many perished these are all who were
left i organized the retreat  

  they were a pitiful few i saw that
had made good their escape my eyes
gladdened when i saw that the girl
lovah was among them ive got to
hand it to luria no fumbling no fear
no hesitation

  then they will surely follow per-
haps they are not too far off to the
caves jimno you lovah and berk
take twenty warriors and cover the rear
ill take the others  

  so get moving stupe hank yelled

  i held both hands out emptily to show
why i wasnt going anywhere immedi-
ately someone thrust a sword into one
hand and a spear into the other and to
make matters completely at a loss for
me hank kicked my mount in the rump
and lovah jimno and i were off to
glory

  into the valley of death rode the
twenty-three i thought as we headed
back lovah reined her panther to my
side

  remember one thing she said as
we rode your paavan is faster in every
way than the okas they ride it is our
real advantage over them you are rid-
ing lipso a well-trained animal i
know because i trained him give him
the reins if we meet danger and stay
close to my man because this will not
be a contest of fists

  lipso was well-trained because when
i leaned over and put my arms about
lovahs waist and drew her close he
didnt move an inch or slack his pace
i kissed her hard perhaps not as satisfy-
ingly as i wanted but for the condition
well enough i guessed it was the first
time shed ever been kissed because she
brought one hand to her mouth in won-
der the most beautiful smile id ever
seen came to life on those wonderful lips
and before i knew what she was intend-
ing she had reached in my direction

hauled me to her and gave me a kiss in
return years went by before i came out
of the halo-like daze i was in from then
on love was the last thing on my mind

  the dirty dogs had set the whole
place on fire not only that but there
were some who were still alive in the
inferno we could hear the screams of
the poor devils jimno took the lead as
though he was born to it

ttis hand shot up and we rode up
until we were a narrow circle
about him he gestured with his hand
toward a stretch of trail which would
lead us between the usual lush jungle
growth with which i was now familiar

  it seems jimno said in a growling
voice that they are too intent on loot
pillage and worse to pursue or perhaps
they think we will wait their coming on
bended knees but soon they will think
of those who escaped then will they
ride after there is no trail other than
through there  

  again i looked to the dense brush
and narrow trail and immediately a pic-
ture formed in mind of what could hap-
pen were we to lay a trap

      we are few but enough for what
we can do to face them squarely would
be suicidal rather let us pair off and
infilter through the brush but not too
far off the trail our paavans move like
shadows between the narrowest part of
the forest their clumsier and slower
beasts cannot follow therefore let us
make haste and make rendezvous with
them as they enter and harry them until
they reach the open spaces then when
we have done with them here let us ride
ahead and make sure we meet them
again later where the forest meets the
hills

  the women wore broad smiles long
before he had finished they needed
nothing further in the way of command
or instruction like shadows they melt-
queen of the panther world



ed into the greyness which bordered the
lush growth in a few seconds it seemed
as though there had never been human
or beast on the trail jimno one of the
women warriors lovah and myself
were the last to lose ourselves

  give lipso his head lovah said
as she moved forward he has been
trained to follow  

  we wound about our beasts moving
in complete silence over fallen logs be-
tween the boles of jungle-giants which
pressed so closely together that it
seemed impossible anything other than
a snake could maneuver his way
through yet the lithe black bodies man-
aged with an ease which astounded me
deeper and further into the gloomy
green we went as though aware of the
impending clash the forest life was
stilled not even the birds trilling their
songs

  lipso and lovahs mount moved tail
to snout so close were they i watched
the lithe form of the woman ahead sud-
denly her hand went to the scabbard
and the long sword came into the open
i followed suit i could see nothing
there was nothing to be seen the
jungle looked as impenetrable as ever
the sun never existed as far as i was
concerned we moved in an odorous
and silent world then lipso stopped
and i became aware that lovah was
sitting erect and expectant

  from somewhere ahead there came
a grunting and squealing the sound of
mens voices lifted in rough talk also
came to our ears but so dimly i couldnt
make out the words my throat tight-
ened so that my breath came out in a
wheeze when i realized that the moment
was at hand for our ambush there was
but a single question in my mind how
were we going to go about it

  lovar answered that question

  her fingers pulled lightly on the reins
and before my startled eyes her mount

leaped nimbly up the huge bole of a
nearby tree immediately lipso fol-
lowed i clung tightly with both hands
about the panthers neck worse was to
follow the animals moved gingerly out
on a limb mine a little below and to the
left of lovahs we perched thus for
the space of perhaps thirty seconds i
saw that we were almost directly above
the narrow twisting trail the grunting
sounds of the animals and the gutteral
sounds of their riders came more dis-
tinctly to my ears

  they were telling each other with a
horrible relish of what they had done
while the houses burned   

a peculiar series of tuneless
whistles broke from the midst of
the forest about us and simultaneously
with those sounds the how of the am-
bush was made clear to me i saw lo-
vahs thighs contract and grip close to
the lean sides of the animal she was on
and the next second the panther was a
black streak of silent fury falling
through space nor was he alone only
reflex came to my help otherwise i
would have ended up on my face in the
grass-grown jungleland but my thighs
did tighten and one arm managed to
hold the reins as lipso left his feet in
a leap after the first panther

  we leaped into the midst of some
eight or nine mounted men the lizard-
elks animals they were on were squeall-
ing wildly as lipso and the other beast
leaped among them slashing with claw
and tearing with fang the instant we
reached the ground lovah shouted for
me to dismount now we were on our
own as i slashed wildly about with the
razor-sharp sword i heard the sounds
of battle all about me but so dense was
the underbrush and so furious the ac-
tion so disconnected i got only flashes
but one was unforgettable jimno had
engaged the largest of the enemy a man


fantastic adventures

i tightened my legs around the body
of the panther as the animal leaped
straight at the oncoming horde and
my sword arm rose to slash quickly   

perhaps a foot taller than himself

  the single glimpse i caught was of
jimno being pressed back into the
jungle by the power of the others sword
play then they were lost to my sight
nor was i interested any further death
and i had come to grips the sword in
my hand was like a broom handle for all
i knew of its use and these men we
had ambushed had been trained since
childhood to its murderous use

  there was only one factor which
saved me from instant extinction we
were fighting in brush there simply
wasnt room for fancy footwork and
dexterous strokes it was hack and chop
and duck and when it came to that i
didnt have to take a back seat to any-
one a lifetime spent in ducking girls
id promised things to came in use

  he got in the first chops but he didnt
lick his lips from them i ducked and
queen of the panther world



took a couple of whacks myself they
were as close to the mark as stalin and
taft all the time my brain was worry-
ing about lovah after all  was fight-
ing even she was taking on the rest
he came at me again and this time i
waited until he was a couple of feet from
me about the length of a sword stroke
the stroke  used was my favorite serv-
ice stroke in tennis i was a shade slow
but it was enough he got his blade up

in a parry holy cats what happened
to him should happen to the rest some-
thing strange happened to hank and
myself in our journey from the earth
to this place our strength multiplied
tenfold my blade not only knocked his
to one side but the end four inches
sliced right through his collar bone and
down into his chest he let out a single
screech and fell backward blood foun-
taining out from the huge wound


fantastic adventures

  i wasted no time in sympathy there
were the ringing sounds of blade strik-
ing blade not far from me i leaped over
a fallen log and into the place where
lovah was battling she had backed up
so that she had her shoulders to a huge
tree facing her were four men two
others lay in the curious positions the
dead assume

tvt y approach was silent the
first they knew of my presence
was when one of them fell face forward
he fell straight down he looked kind of
funny what with his head going one
way and his body another nor did i
waste time in watching him once again
my tennis came to a more different use
id used a forehand on the first the
second fell into a backhand that riggs
would have envied there was only one
thing wrong with it i clouted this char-
acter across the chest the blade went
all the way into him and stuck there
i yanked at it and finally stuck one
foot up against the guy and tried to
pull it out but no use it wasnt till i
thought of the dead mans sticker and
turned and picked it off the ground that
i realized that all the time i was vul-
nerable to attack from the other two

  i needent have worried they were
being taken care of but good my lovah
child was no mean shakes with the
sword those two characters were danc-
ing a pretty good lindy to the tune she
was playing im sure they wanted to
be anywhere else but where they were
even as i watched she lunged with her
sword straight out and pinked one of
the boys right through his throat he
wasnt going to swallow anything for a
long while without it leaking out

  lovah i screamed suddenly
watch it

  she had slipped on a wet spot of
grass and in that second the other one
was at her side her sword had flown

out of her hand as she threw up her
arms trying to maintain a balance she
was completely helpless and i was too
far from her to help there was but one
thing to do i lifted my sword and
heaved it point forward the guys
sword was already coming down when
mine hit it went all the way through
him he fell straight down over the girl
and from where i was standing it
looked like id thrown too late

  angel i moaned as i ran forward
and knelt at her side i shoved the car-
cass of the goon whod fallen over her
to one side and lifted her up angel
talk to me  

  i will she said as soon as i get
my breath back now she continued
after id kissed her for a while let us
get out of here theyll organize soon
and we are too few to do more than
we have  

  she arose and puckered her lips into
that tuneless whistle in a second the
two panthers came trotting to us their
snouts were stained with blood and it
drooled from the corners of their
mouths they hadnt been loafing either
lovar leaped into the flat saddle and i
followed there was no need to give the
animals their orders they knew by in-
stinct what was expected of them

  whirling they loped off at top speed
through the thick growth in a short
while we joined the rest at the rendez-
vous agreed on we took stock our
entire losses were one warrior and two
panthers jimno was elated

  we have halted them for a while
now they will proceed with caution
which was our purpose    about and
make for the hills

lt ank had grim lines to his face

      but they were erased at sight of
me riding in the fore with lovah and
jimno jimno shouted the news while
we were still a hundred feet from the
queen of the panther world



entire remnants of the camp a wild yell
of exultation went up from their throats
at the news only luria held her re-
serve but even she could not help but
smile

  they surrounded us and asked a
hundred questions i let jimno take the
stage the guy deserved it he had
staged a masterful ambush and had
gotten away with remarkably small
losses hank dragged me to one side and
pumped me dry of what had happened

  the sound of lurias voice broke up
our gab-fest

  let us not waste time in useless talk
jimno and the others did a good job
they have delayed the pursuit for a
time but when they realize how small
a force opposed them they will come the
more quickly

  we cannot stay here and we cannot
go in a single body to the place where
we will be safe therefore i think it
best to assign squad leaders to groups
who will then take different trails to our
eventual goal

  jimno because you have proved
your unquestioned leadership you will
take the largest group all warriors and
fight a rear-guard action to delay and
harass the enemy wamini and saavah
will lead the women and children by
the trail i have outlined to the place
of safety lovah you will be in charge
of the balance of the warriors men and
women who will wait here until jimno
returns and fight a battle with the
enemy but that can wait until the oth-
ers have left

  it was remarkable how little confu-
sion there was luria amazed hank and
myself in her showing of leadership it
just didnt seem right that so beautiful
a woman should have qualities that was
rightfully mans in a very short time
several lines spread from the encamp-
ment in various directions some toward
the hills close by others back in the

direction from which wed just come
and one the smallest group in a direc-
tion at right angles to the back trail
this group was led by jimno i won-
dered where they were going when the
last had left only hank luria two of
her personal guards and myself were
left

  and now luria said turning to
hank and me we too must journey
let us hope we are successful  

  why where are we going hank
asked

  to the valley of the mists to that
same valley where first you saw me as
though in a dream there the groana
bird makes his home and there is where
the dread beast of flame lives we must
bring back the groana bird  

  why hank asked again

  because it was the symbol of my
fathers strength and even loko will
respect it and give up his pretensions
remember how you were captured he
too wants the bird but we have one
thing in our favor i know the birds
haunts he doesnt

  i listened to the first part of it then
my thoughts wandered lovah had been
chosen to give battle to the enemy of
a sudden i felt fear strike at my in-
nards i knew then that i had fallen
in love with my amazon and i was
frightened they had seemed so few
riding back toward what their doom

  we have a long ride ahead and a
dangerous one luria continued talk
wastes time  

t t was the longest ride id ever been
on since there was no appreciable
change in time i never knew what was
what we slept we ate and we rode
and always the sun was overhead

  there were times for eating and
sleeping and after a while i managed
to gain a sort of idea from our sleeping
habits of an approximate time we were


fantastic adventures

on the trail at least one week the
topography held to about the same
character until about the last day

  the first few miles of our ride after
the awakening on what i called the sev-
enth day we rode through a narrow
valley set between two high and preci-
pitous hills we had been in the midst
of mountain country for a long time
suddenly luria who was riding at the
head of our little column waved her
hand to the right and swerved from the
path shed been riding on to a narrow
trail which led straight up the wall of
the cliff

  the trail straightened and to my hor-
ror became part of the wall itself even
a rocky mountain goat would have
found it difficult traveling not these
panthers though they moved swiftly
and surely along the narrow trail then
with an abruptness which took my
breath away the trail ended against a
barrier of rock i was next to last so i
could not see what luria was doing or
where she was going i saw only the
chalky-white face of the wall towering
over us lipso had stopped and was
waiting patiently to go on

  the panther and its mount directly
in front of me began a slow advance
and lipso followed i saw then where
we were heading and my wonder was
boundless a path had been hewed like
a tunnel directly into the cliff and for
the first time i knew darkness on pola

  it was instant i dont know how the
animals managed to find their way in-
stinct i suppose but the darkness was
too much for me i couldnt see my nose
in front of my face and since our foot-
falls were muffled we seemed to be trav-
eling in the silence of a tomb

  once more the transition from dark
to light was instantaneous we were in
a shallow amphitheatre but one which
stretched for limitless distances we
rode up to join luria she looked out

over the mists and said in a small child-
ish voice

  the valley of the mists the lair of
the beast my father took me and mo-
kar here once in the long ago mokar
has never forgotten look  

  we followed the line of her out-
stretched finger and an involuntary
shiver shook my frame never had i
seen a more forbidding place the mists
were like feathers of smoke they filled
the place in breath width and height
now and then the mists would part for
an instant and black damp rock would
show monstrous shapes like a scene
from hell strange hissing noises came
alive to lend added terror to the pros-
pect lurias shoulders squared and
turning to us she said in dry sure
tones

  we gain nothing here the groana
bird lies there let us be on our way
one thing the beast of flame lies in
wait watch for him

  there was but one trouble with be-
ing on our way the instant we moved
into the mists it was like stepping into
a thick fog i know i was riding along-
side one of the two huge women who
were lurias personal guards the next
i knew lipso and i were alone in this
strange and terrifying world

  lipso sensed it immediately and his
steps became cautious and slow he
snuffled loudly nor was he alone the
rest of them also used their noses rather
than their eyes the mists would part
now and then giving us glimpses of what
lay beyond it also permitted us to see
whether we were still together we
werent once i saw hank he looked
a bit bewildered and his head was mov-
ing from side to side as though in search
of luria the mists closed down and
once more we groped our way through
the fog

  i echoed in a minor chord the sudden
scream which arose from the mists it
queen of the panther world



was a human scream and hard on its
heels came a roar which turned me into
a block of ice lipso grunted a low
growl and his body tensed the muscles
bunching under me as though it was
getting ready to spring

  like magic the mists parted altogeth-
er and i saw the whole of this horren-
dous place we were in a grotto di-
rectly in front of me was one of the
women guards by her side was hank
i as usual was the last in the parade
off to one side away from the rest was
luria but all of us were looking at
what lay before us

t t was a nightmare the body of the
beast was a good thirty feet in
length i recognized it as the same in
species as those we had encountered in
the pit but this one was the daddy of
them all smoke and fire came from its
nostrills the great triangular head
moved back and forth like a snakes
and lying under the ridiculous paws
was the broken body of the other
amazon   

  back luria shouted ill take
care of him

  hanks shout was lost in the roar
which came from the animals throat
i was too terrified to move i could only
watch the spectable which followed
with a fascinated horror i noticed little
things the fact that the guard must
have come onto the cave that was the
beasts lair unaware of its occupant
that the panther she rode must have
thrown her in his panic to escape be-
cause she was lying face upward on her
back i saw too that the grotto was im-
mense the entrance being at least a
hundred feet in height

  then the mists closed in again

  lovahs admonition came to mind
that if i was ever in a spot to give
lipso his head i let the reins go slack
and the shape below me moved back

  and forth in its tracks without making
a forward step when the beast did go
forward it was slowly a rank odor so
strong i had to hold my breath at in-
tervals wafted in to us from ahead the
roars had increased in both intensity
and constancy and now they were
closer   

  and again the mists lifted

  lipso halted in his progress a snarl
rose in his throat the tableaux had
evolved in action luria too must have
stopped when the scene was obscured
now she went into action her lovely
body was bent forward until it seemed
to lie along the sleek black length of the
panther her spear was couched low the
long needle-tip pointed straight for the
beast ahead i saw her heels dig into
mokars side and with a ferocious
roar mokar leaped forward

  i yelped in horror as lipso followed
mokars lead there had been some sort
of telepathic orders from either mokar
or his mistress because the beasts of
hank and the other guard also shot
toward the beast in the grotto entrance
luria reached the beast first though we
couldnt have been more than ten feet
behind the last fifteen feet mokar left
his feet in a tremendous bound the
terror ahead rose on its hind legs the
tiny paws waving ridiculously toward
the woman and her mount but the ter-
rible snout was open and the rows of
huge teeth were an obstacle i never
dreamed id have to face directed
toward the foolhardy things challeng-
ing it

  at the very last second mokar
changed direction with a wondrously
lithe movement of his body and instead
of coming in from the front came in
from the side then lipso was in the
air too instinctively i brought my
spear to a position similar to the one
luria had used

  a violent roar of rage shook the air


fantastic adventures

luria had driven her spear straight into
the leathery skin of the beasts throat
she hadnt waited for the thing to re-
taliate mokar had seen to it his mis-
sion accomplished mokar turned tail
and leaped to safety but lipso wasnt
that fortunate

  i was a lot more clumsy than luria
had been my spear glanced off the
thick skin and flew to one side my
thoughts had been on the destructive
power of the great teeth and jaws id
forgotten about his tail suddenly it
swished around and caught lipso full
in the side i heard him grunt softly and
felt the beast below me go limp i barely
managed to fall to one side as lipso
was knocked a half dozen feet by the
blow he lay where he fell nor did he
so much as move a muscle

  now the thing had something it could
vent its spleen on i managed to get to
my feet just as the beast reached me
i had been given a sword i went for it
like an outlaw goes for the colt at his
hip when the marshall comes for him
i drew it just as i felt the beasts rank
breath on my face and saw the saw-
teeth within a foot of me i leaped to
one side and as i did swung the long
blade

   he sword went right through the

    ugly snout the most frightful roar
of all went up and a thick terribly odor-
ous mucous flowed out of the wound in
a torrent the stench of it was over-
powering there was a confused sound
of shouting as i backed off a couple of
feet but i was strictly intent on the
thing in front of me it hadnt given up
the battle it still had a tail and too ob-
viously no intelligence though the
wound i had given it was terrible the
beast seemed unaware of it its tail
swished out again but this time i was
on the watch for it and this time i
wasnt alone

  hanks voice was low but full of
strength

  okay pal lets go to work

  this time it was we who attacked
hank took one side and i the other we
leaped in our swords swinging with
perhaps not the finesse of the others
but certainly with better effect for
every time we struck the steel plowed
right through either the thickness of
skin was deceptive or our strength was
greater than we had ever imagined it to
be the whole slaughter couldnt have
taken more than a few seconds the last
of the pieces to be dissected was the
tail two swipes one a forehand the
other a backhand and the tail was just
a memory for nightmare moe

  in the meantime the other guard had
joined us her first thrust with the spear
had been a good one she had managed
to withdraw the weapon before her
paavan leaped to safety now she stood
by our side and jabbed with it like a
probing needle i wondered why until
quite suddenly the beast sank down and
rolled slowly over the thing had a spot
through which he could be dealt a mor-
tal bow the gal did it with one jab

  we stopped our swinging and stood
looking at each other our breaths com-
ing in shallow gasps the woman
though the label sounded silly towered
over us and had the muscles of a foun-
dry worker shook her head in admira-
tion and said

  truly you two are the greatest war-
riors in all pola never have i seen such
sword strokes never have i seen such
strength the habasi is not faced
calmly and this one is truly the largest
i have ever seen his skin is like the
thick bark of the ofas tree which is
like a metal yet your blades sliced him
as though he were meat ready for the
table   

  she continued to shake her head in
wordless admiration i noticed that
queen of the panther world



hank however was no longer basking
in the glow of that admiration his head
was bent to one side suddenly he
snapped the fingers of his free hand and
whirled to me

  luria where is she

  the mists seemed to have lifted with
some degree of finality at any rate
they no longer enveloped us with their
foggy tenuous fingers there was noth-
ing to be seen of luria or mokar

  the wide nostrils of the woman
spread in anger she bent in a semi-
crouch as though she were sniffing a
danger not to be seen hank too kept
looking from one side of the tortured
bit of ground as though he thought the
girl had fallen among some of the rocks
as usual when it came to luria hank
was the first to guess at her where-
abouts he gathered she hadnt fled the
scene he must have also reasoned then
that there was but one place she could
be the grotto that had been the ha-
basis home

 without a word or look hank
whirled and leaped toward the entrance
i followed but not with as much en-
thusiasm in fact the woman was on
hanks heels there was a dim light as
we came into the grotto proper it died
slowly until we were running in total
darkness after the first few hundred
feet suddenly as though someone had
turned on dim lights all over the cave
a radiance came to life it wasnt much
but it was enough to light our way

te were running on some sort of
moss for our footsteps were
soundless the cave was dry and rather
cool it led straight back and at a slight-
ly downward grade suddenly we came
against a blank wall i mean just that
there were no forks in the road we had
been running the cave ended up
against that blank wall

  what the    hank growled but

this doesnt make sense

  does anything in this goofy place
i asked

  then where did luria go he
asked

  in the meantime the woman had been
moving along the wall suddenly she
bent and began a loud sniffling some two
feet from the ground

  mokar she announced has been
here his scent is strong here  
hank took her at her word but me
i was skeptical

  well i ventured then the only
conclusion is that she vanished into thin
air and knowing the young lady as well
as we do i wouldnt doubt it

  uh uh hank said shaking his
head doggedly there wouldnt be any
reason for it

  no perhaps her old man was a
smart guy and put this groana bird in
a place where only his daughter could
get at it

  then why did he keep it a secret
hank asked

  i had no answer for that

  in the meantime the woman had been
busy her fingers tapped the surface
ran lightly across the face as though in
search of some crack not seen by the
eyes suddenly she let out a bark of
triumph we stepped quickly to her
side

  whats up i asked

  for an answer she slammed the palm
of her hand against the rock it spun
away from her and before our aston-
ished eyes we saw a long narrow room
high-ceilinged and with walls of natu-
ral rock at the far end we saw mokar
loling at his ease of luria nothing was
to be seen of course we realized what
had happened the wall swung on a
pivot lurias bodyguard had reasoned
that since the trail ended there it had to
continue beyond her sense of smell had
told her that mokar had come to that


fantastic adventures

point unless they had disappeared into
air they had to be somewhere beyond
the wall

  hank was first to step through i fol-
lowed and the woman brought up the
rear we saw it simultaneously in one
corner of the room was an immense bird
cage luria stood beside it crooning
something to a brilliantly colored bird
which rocked back and forth on a perch
she turned saw us smiled a welcome
and turned back to the bird we came
over and ranged ourselves beside the
girl i looked at the bird with curiosity

  they could call it what they wanted
groana bird holy bird or anything
else as far as i was concerned it was
a polly hank had the same sentiments

  a cockatoo he said in a low voice

  aah shut up the bird suddenly
screached

  shut up yourself hank blazed

  okay if thats what you want the
bird said

  luria turned an angry face to us

  and just when i had soothed the
groana bird she said through slitted
lips i could i could   her voice
trailed off in helpless syllables

  groana shmoana i said wht is
this hes nothing but a parrot whats
all the fuss about

  yeah the parrot said whats all
the fuss for

  do you mean hank asked that
this is the holy bird your father held in
such high esteem

  the wisest animal in the whole
world luria said what he says be-
comes law we must bring him back
with us

  so okay i said only lets get out
of this dungeon its beginning to give
me the creeps

  i had a swell idea that is until they
began searching for the door to open
the cage and discovered there was none
the bars were set close enough to hold

the bird prisoner i wondered how they
had placed him inside the bird
watched our parade around his cage
with cocked head and jaundiced eye
after a few moments of it he broke out
in his raucous voice

  lets not keep up this silly dance
besides im getting hungry lets get
me out of this place

  id like to twist that fool head of
yours from those feathers i said
viciously

  ha-ha the bird crowed so would
a lot of them so come and get me 

t saw red then i saw a lot of other
colors all on the bird and i had a
wild desire to tear that bird in two i
stalked forward grabbed the bars and
twisted even though i knew i was be-
ing foolish after all even a dope like
me could see they were made to hold
something a lot stronger than a bird
but i was mad   

  they bent as though they were made
of spaghetti there was a last raucous
crow of delight a flash of color past
my eyes and the voice of the bird behind
me

  thanks pal i was getting tired of
being a bird in a cage me without no
gilt   

  i whipped around and there was our
little feathered friend perched on the
shoulder of luria i was still seeing red
i gave him a fiendish look i hoped
and stalked toward the two luckily
hank stopped me

  aah let im come the bird said
ill tear im in two or three i got
lots of numbers

  but only one life bird you aint a
cat just remember that i mumbled
darkly

  the parrot cocked his head to one
side gave luria a sidelong look from his
bright eyes and said
queen of the panther world



  whered you find the squares beau-
tiful what dopes especially the one
who talks

  oh groana bird luria said we
have searched long for you the days
are dark on pola since my father left to
join his soul-mates   

  that blasted bit of feathers and beak
just couldnt keep quiet

  thats what i kept tellin the old
boy better watch your knittin or
theyre gonna take that sweater apart
before youre through with it so he
perled when he shoulda knit and see
what happened but like yap-jaw says
this dungeons beginning to give me the
creeps and ive been here a lot longer
than he so  

  lurias sigh of happiness as she
turned and started back was like a song
to hank he stepped close to her side
and grinned down at her from his van-
tage of two inches with a grin that had
it been wider would have set his ears
on the other side of his head oh well
i thought now that the worst is over
and we aint got nothing else to do ex-
cept pick up the marbles maybe shell
send us back and i can finish that story
for fa   

	 

  they whistled up the dead womans
paavan for me and with the bird still
perched on lurias shoulder we started
on the way back once more we moved
through the valley of the mists but this
time the terror was gone again we came
to the tortuous path along the shoulder
of the steep mountain side and this
time like with all dangers circumvented
it seemed not quite so frightening i
even found myself whistling as the
sleek sure-footed panthers trotted
along we passed a twisted tree i re-
membered was not far from where wed
come off the main trail and in a very
short while we were on the broad trail
leading back to gayno

  at ease now i noticed things which
had escaped me before to our right
some hundred yards a wide river fol-
lowed a winding path and now and
then i could see the swirling muddy
waters to our left the grass grew thick
and rank sometimes higher than a
paavans shoulder i remembered how
the women rose from the midst of grass
like this and thought what an excellent
ambush it would make we were run-
ning on what i called a path i called it
that for want of another name really
it was a flattened area among the other
grasses

  soon we came to the short bit of
parkland which once traversed would
lead us to the wider path back to gayno
the path wound among the trees for
perhaps a mile then we saw open
reaches and shortly the trees thinned
and we were racing in the open again a
soft wind ruffled my hair the air was
not too warm and the sun held a bright-
ness which unlike ours did not irritate
for the first time in this strange land
i felt peace but not for long

a i i here must have been a thousand
of them they descended on us like
flies luria was the first to see them
some sixth sense warned her of their
proximity for suddenly she drew mo-
kar up sharp raised a hand on high as
a signal to halt and as the ambush
rose about us shouted a warning but
it was of no avail

  we had been running with some five
yards between each rider there was no
chance to get to luria i found myself
surrounded by dozens of lokos men i
glimpsed captain mita up ahead close
to luria then hands were reaching for
my bridle i had no chance to get my
sticker out but my fists werent tied
down i must have knocked ten of them
silly before someone thought to use the
hilt of a sword on my noggin i saw


fantastic adventures

more stars than the heavens held and in
a twinkling the darkness of uncon-
sciousness

  i was being joted like a monkey on
a stick my head rocked from side to
side like someone was using it for a
metronome i had been strapped to
what was undoubtedly the worst smell-
ing man in all pola his stench was un-
bearable i peered through bleared eyes
at a long line of warriors strung out
ahead of us i managed to turn my head
and saw that the line behind us was al-
most as long

  there was someone ahead swearing
a blue streak i couldnt make the words
out but it didnt take long for me to
recognize the voice good old groana
he was telling them a thing or two a
lot of good it was doing i thought this
time we wouldnt get off so easy what
was more loko had luria now i be-
gan to wonder what he wanted of her

  we came to a fork in the road which
had widened and took the right turning
after a while we came to a broad mead-
owland tents had been set up in well-
laid sections like streets or suddenly i
knew what a military encampment to
our right as we entered was a stockade
where i saw a huge number of the
strange beasts they used sentries were
posted every few yards their disci-
pline was excellent the warriors de-
ployed to their respective areas leaving
some ten to guard us as we followed
captain mita the giant who had
slapped me around and loko we drew
up before the most pretentious of the
tents this proved to be lokos personal
quarters

  they had to cut me loose from the
guy i was with and whoever did the
cutting didnt give a hang whether or
not he got some skin with it in fact
he laughed heartily as i yelped more
than once when the sticker drew blood
but the moment i was on my feet all

merriment ceased the point of the
mans sword tickled my spine all the
way into the shady confines of the tent

  the appointments were simple a
couple of easy chairs of good design
with cushions for seats several benches
of plain wood and a dozen low hassocks
scattered about served for seats the
back wall of the tent was guarded by
five men and a like number of women-
warriors they stood stiffly at attention
spears held firmly in one hand while the
other was at their hip in readiness to
grab at the sword if needed

  loko and the big guy found seats side
by side at the far end of the tent loko
grunted tiredly and said

  my years are too many for these
strenuous doings ye have given me a
merry chase perhaps it was well that ye
escaped the pit for surely we would not
have found our quarry so easily and
better the prize she carried ho guard
bring the holy bird to me  

e were standing in a close
group hank luria her guard and
myself the bird was still perched on
lurias shoulder we had been stripped
of weapons as the guard stepped to
lurias side hank took a single step
forward and knocked the character
right on his seat

  atta boy hit im one for me the
groana shouted raucously kick im in
the slats

  lokos voice was low seemingly
without anger yet i felt a shiver

  ye have used force before shall we
be compelled to answer in the same
no lurias answer was a clarion
call enough of force for hundreds
of years pola has known nothing else
you decry the use of it yet never feel
any compunctions about using it when
it avails you best by my fathers name
i swear the bird will avail you nought
there are other means of freeing pola
queen of the panther world



from your tyranny

  i wanted to cheer for the first time
i felt an admiration based on valid
reasons for luria she was all right

  the big guy up there with loko
thought so too he let out a wordless
bellow and rose to his feet

  by the groana bird he shouted
loko your word i want that woman
hear me

  over my dead body came the
answer from my side it was good old
hank good old hank and his good old
big yap wasnt he ever going to learn
to keep it closed he got the only reply
the other character could have given

  i shall be only too glad to arrange
that the big guy said

  enough wost loko broke in
brawls are for those in their cups save
it for then now then enough of this
bring the bird up here

  this time no one raised either fist
or voice when two of the guards
stepped out and took the bird from
lurias shoulder the one who was car-
rying the bird carried it gingerly and
when he got to loko handed it to the
old man with fingers that shook palpa-
bly there was the strangest look of
triumph on lokos face as he got the
bird

  now and this time his voice was
raised in ecstasy now i shall rule by
the sign of the holy groana bird by
the sign of his feathers by the sign of
his wisdom and by the sign of my pos-
session   

  aah nuts said the parrot unex-
pectedly

  holy bird loko said in tones of
awe as though the goofy parrot had
said something beyond his comprehen-
sion say more in your infinite wis-
dom

  is this character square the bird
asked why dont he get the score
straight boy oh boy how did this

oldy get dealt in

  i dont know i said maybe you
can arrange his getting dealt out
thats allroony with me allreeti
allreeti groana gaillard said

joko kept shifting his glance from
the bird to me and back again as
we carried on his fingers tapped nerv-
ously together in constant motion and
his brow showed irritable corrugations
in his effort to understand

  what does he say loko asked me
in petulant tones

  ingimsay an ongsay hank shot at
me from the side of his mouth

  the holy bird says i began as
portenticusly as i could that he is
weary and needs rest

  but of course loko made haste to
fall in to the suggestion may he for-
give an old mans stupidity many
many years have passed in his incar-
ceration may the memory of the man
who enslaved him become dust in our
mouths a stench in our nostrils
gadzooks groana pistole said
the varlet needs a cup to wander in
pon my soul an by my lud harry
with whom i spent many a roistering
night get him one and fill it with the
dregs of the grape so that merry eng-
land shall have peace this day

  peace peace loko said he de-
sires peace

  aah shut up the bird said and
bent and nipped loko on the lobe of
the nearest ear

  he means quiet i said and if i
am allowed a word   

  loko held one hand to his wounded
ear and said

  say on  

  i decided that formality was the note
to strike loko liked it well

  the holy bird has some small af-
fection for the girl since it is obvious
she cannot escape perhaps it were best


fantastic adventures

that he stay with her

  no i do not trust her further she
is as are the rest of you my prisoners
i have as yet not decided the disposi-
tion i intend of ye

   tis a sorry day fr the irish me
lad groana fitzgerald said an sure
an if its the last act of me life ill kiss
the blarney stone on me hands and
knees but let me have a chance at a

shillalah

  you see loko i said in triumph
another word a single syllable of de-
nial to his desires and he promises to
call on the holy blarney stone believe
me woe betide anyone accursed by the
stone

  loko blanched to the color of wet
ivory at the words the only one of the
three loko mita and wost who
showed no alarm at the words was
wost but then he was probably too
dull-witted to know fear

  but of course of course the holy
bird can stay with the girl loko said
quickly i was but thinking of its se-
curity

  is that schmoe kidding groana
hope asked

  what does he say what does he
say loko asked he was like a kid
before a mike without a quizmaster

  he says hes tired and wants to
rest i said

  assuredly assuredly loko said
shaking hands and head at the same
time the time for sleep has come
captain mita escort the prisoners
guests might be a better word i
said being brave all of a sudden

  for the first time loko showed anger
his eyes blazed for an instant then hid
themselves behind hooded lids his
voice held an icy edge when he said
prisoners    do not try my pa-
tience   

  i shrugged my shoulders in a ges-
ture of bravery i certainly didnt feel i

knew i was shaking quivering in fear
yet somehow i managed to say in quite
normal tones

  okay let it be like you say only
lets stop with all this talk i said the
bird was tired do we have to talk some
more about that

  take them to their quarters loko
bit out

  captain mita and his men played es-
cort it was just to another tent one
not too far from lokos there was no
question however that we were going
to be prisoners mita posted enough
guards around the tent to guard an
army they stood shoulder to shoulder
in a huge square and within that square
another these backs to the others and
also shoulder to shoulder

  this tent didnt have the accommo-
dations lokos had it was not to be
expected but there were several cush-
ions luria and her personal guard took
those i hid a smile here were a couple
of dames who were doing their best to
act like men yet used a womans per-
rogative immediately the chance pre-
sented itself hank and i found the
ground hard but not too much so

  very soon after we made ourselves
comfortable the feeling for sleep mani-
fested itself it was a strange thing this
feeling for sleep there was no night
or day on pola since the sun shone all
the time and the business of sleep was
as regulated an affair as though there
had been passed a law about it ones
eyes became heavy ones every muscle
felt an odd relaxing and very soon aft-
erward one simply relaxed somewhere
and went to sleep

  the strangest part of it all was that
sleep was instantaneous all over pola
it was not up to the individual as to
when he slept when one slept all slept

 a wakening too took place si-
 multaneously i yawned once or
queen of the panther world



twice arose and stretched and looked
at the others the parrot blinked its
eyes cocked its head and said

  well bless our little    say hows
about putting on the feed bag kids
luria and the other woman looked
to me and i suddenly became aware
that i had been relegated to the par-
rots interpreter not that hank
couldnt understand but i had assumed
the position in lokos headquarters i
wasnt too happy about it but i wasnt
in any position to do anything about it
now

  he just wants to eat i said sourly
something wrong in that the bird
asked or am i supposed to live on
air

  aah dont get so fussy i said
how did you manage in that cave
it was like this short dark and
ugly the bird said believe it or not
i was in a trance

  so put yourself back in a trance
again and forget about feeding that
ugly face of yours i said

  i ducked just in time before the last
word had left my lips luria leaped for
me she swung a little late hank got
there before she could swing again she
was wrhite-faced in anger

  i listened to him berate the holy
bird yesterday and could barely contain
my anger i did so because he is your
friend but i can no longer contain my
anger

  daughter    daughter   

  we all looked to the parrot who at
lurias sudden move had hopped to the
hassock for safety he was using a new
voice now low deep flexible it was a
caressing voice yet not a weak one it
brought luria up short i heard her
whisper father then the bird was
talking again

  have all my teachings been in vain
is anger the only vessel of those which
i had placed at your disposal the one

to be used anger blinds ones senses
disturbs the delicate balance of reason
and as i once said should only be used
as a dart is used for purposes of irri-
tation

  surely is your predicament great
surely is the hand of the traitor loko
heavy on your shoulders he seeks the
enslavement of all pola yet in your
womanly manner you seek quarrels
bend all your energies to the frustra-
tion of his desires and ambitions use
these two whom you have brought from
another plane of time and space to your
help waste not their uses in arguments
once i taught you the eyes ears nos-
trils and all other physical senses can
be tamed and put to the purpose for
which they were intended how little
understanding was given to my teach-
ings   

  no father luria breathed sharp-
ly no   

  perhaps but had you been alert in
all your being surely you would have
understood the badinage between this
man and myself silence would have
been my weapon had i been displeased
but i think altogether that perhaps the
true reason for your lack of understand-
ing lies in your having forgotten some-
thing i once said in your hearing

  daughter do you remember a day
you walked into a council meeting you
sat at my feet and heard me tell them
about the holy groana bird it was the
first you heard of it it was also the first
they heard of it i told them that in this
bird was all the wisdom past present
and future then as you sat and
watched i called for a slave to bring
the bird forth they marveled at the
strange creature for never had they
seen one with such plumage that very
afternoon i spoke to you about trans-
migrations of bodies in space and time
you were old enough wise enough and
learned enough even then to add to-


fantastic adventures

gether the ingredients of the pot and
come to the proper conclusion

  for why you should have asked
has there never been another such bird
found and how is it possible that this
bird alone of all the feathered beings
in the world is possessed of so much
wisdom i thought you understood i
was wrong however that is in the past
the present is bleak indeed therefore

let us speak of the future loko has
naught but ill in his bosom for all of
you death lies across the threshold
how shall we circumvent him

t ittle by little as the bird contin-
ued with his talk we had drawn up
close around him we were a very tight
circle about the hassock on which he
stood perched



fantastic adventures

  daughter many years were spent
in the teaching of the paavan i gave
you mokar has the instincts of a wild
animal but he has been taught reason
almost to the capacity of a human he
as well as the mounts of lokos min-
ions is in the stockade at the begin-
ning of the encampment send a thought
wave to him tell him to escape and
bring the rescuers to us  

  i glanced over my shoulder and saw
that luria had her eyes closed in a sec-
ond she opened them and smiled she
shook her head as though she had fol-
lowed her fathers instructions

       then let us wait as best we can
the coming of jimno and the others for
i think loko has thought over the ar-
guments of your friend and has decided
it were best i were with him

  the bird must have been psychic
the words were scarcely out of his
mouth when the tent flaps were thrown
back and mita entered at the head of a
squad of men without a word he
marched up and swept his hand down
and grabbed up the bird the bird let
out a frightened squawk but before he
could utter another sound mita drew a
hood from his belt and threw it over the
parrots head in the meantime his
squad stood guard with drawn swords
over us we had no chance to do any-
thing about it

  tell loko luria said as mita was
about to leave that it will do him no
good the holy bird has a will of its
own   

  mita smiled craftily

  i do not doubt that he said softly
but it is only a bird if none but loko
hears the pearls of wisdom from its lips
who will deny them

  i will luria said stoutly

  a carcass has no voice or reason
mita said grunted softly at the star-
tled looks on our faces and left

  why those dirty dirty    hank

snarled and became silent for fear that
his words would offend their ears

  but i was way ahead of them so that
was lokos game i had to admire the
old characters shrewdness all he had
to do was slit the birds tongue then
who was there to say that loko hadnt
heard what he said he did the bird
wasnt going to be able to talk for itself
and we wernt going to be in any posi-
tion at least not until the dead can be
resurrected to be able to deny what
loko said

  hank was pounding a fist into a
palm his grey-green eyes were bleak
and his face had that stony look of in-
tense anger i could almost read his
mind evidently luria also could

  theres no use in empty and useless
speculations or threats she said we
are helpless until help arrives so let
us be of good cheer

  but how do you know help will
come hank asked

  she smiled and i thought of the mona
lisa mokar will not fail us she said
mokar  

  he is well on his way

  but that stockade hank said
how was he able to to    but of
course understanding came to him i
only hope he will make it in time i
think loko wont give us too much of
that commodity

  i stuck my two cents in

  and lokos just the sort of guy
whod keep us on tenterhooks draw the
time out let us think that maybe he
wont cut our throats or whatever
theyre going to do until the last second
somehow though i have an idea that
it wont be too soon

  a deep sigh turned our attention to
the gigantic woman who was standing
by lurias side

 whats wrong sanda luria
asked

  im hungry was the simple reply
queen of the panther world



  the big gal talks sense i said so
am i

t ut food wasnt to come for a long
 time we sat around lay around
talked kept quiet did everything to
make the time pass more quickly luria
and hank got together in a corner and
found things in common i gathered
without being told that hank was
pitching woo at her and from the look
on her face she wasnt finding it hard
to take but me i was lost the other
member of our party was built along
the lines of an overweight wrestler be-
sides she was a little short of the grey
matter about all there was for me was
some silent philosophy and thats
pretty difficult to do in my position

  when food did come there was
enough of it to feed an army

  like wed asked for a last meal
hank said

  i was taking a bite on something that
tasted pretty good but at that i kind
of lost my appetite

  why dont you gag yourself i
asked

  how about you doing it he want-
ed to know

  i got both hands busy dope i
said

  so why dont you try eating with
your feet ten fingers arent enough for
you

  look sponge-head i began edgily
i didnt like the tone of his voice i
didnt ask to come along on the ride so
dont play sad-sack for my benefit 

  oh hell berk he said im
sorry

  dont be square i said quickly
that was no joke son

  the two women kept giving us won-
dering glances luria could understand
the kings english but our version was
over her head the other gal was just
size no quality except in muscle of

course suddenly the thought came to
me how to make time pass talk i had
discovered long ago is the finest de-
vourer of time

  yknow i said ive always been
curious as to how you managed this
business of now im here now im not
just how do you do it

  tiny furrows formed between her
eyebrows as she concentrated in an ex-
planation which would be simple
enough yet explanatory

  oddly enough she said its a
great deal more simple than you would
imagine yet in one sense more com-
plex you see the whole thing is a mat-
ter of shall we say mind over mat-
ter   

  so you said and youre glad i
broke in elucidate on this bit of men-
tal gymnastics

       but because it is mind triumph-
ing over matter the explanation is far
more difficult than say the process of
digestion she went on as though there
hadnt been an interruption

  now i understand i said how
simple the whole thing is dear but
youre so clever  

  let her be berk hank said go
on baby

  baby the word wasnt new to her
but its connotation in the sense hank
gave was

  a term of endearment i said but
as hank says go on

  yes-s    well i simply think the
object or person into another dimension
of space and time and that is the whole
thing put as simply as i can

  fine i dont get it tell me this
now when we first saw you you were
dressed in clothes very much the same
as the women wear on our planet
howd you do that

  i realized the instant the transposi-
tion took place and i saw the manner
of dress of your women that i would be


fantastic adventures

taken for a stranger not knowing the
customs of your planet or country i
knew i had to do something about it
so i  

tow wasnt that like a woman i
thought give her a joke to tell and
shes a cinch to forget the pay line give
her a story and at the most interesting
part shell get that far-away look like
as if shed just remembered something
she saw in a blouse and couldnt quite
remember the shop it was hank how-
ever who nudged her on

  so you what

  i lost my material self she said

  i thought i heard right but i wanted
to make sure

  you dood lucky you found it
what do you mean

  i mean i was no longer flesh and
blood for example the outfit i wore
i got that from a shop on a city avenue
i remember it was dark and i simply
walked in through the masonry and
glass took the outfit i wanted and left
it was not the time for sleep so i walked
about i also remember an experiment i
performed this disappearance of ma-
terial self was new to me there was a
man coming toward me i walked
straight at and through him i remem-
ber it so well because he was with a
woman and they were holding a conver-
sation he did not lose a word as i
stepped through him

  so there were ghosts they all come
from pola hm could that mean there
was no heaven no hell just pola aah
what was i thinking hank it devel-
oped wasnt thinking what i was

  how simple it all is he said all
you have to do is dematerialize step
through the tent and escape

  i thought of that and    no we
are all in this together so well remain
but loko will put you to death
hank pointed out

when that bridge is on us well
think about the crossing let us wait
to see what mokar brings

  i dont know what hes bringing i
said but i hope he makes it fast my
patience is running out

  then youll have to renew it luria
said sharply mokar might have come
to jimno in the midst of an engagement
whats more they have to be certain
that the children are in a safe place
that there will be enough guards then
they must locate lovah and her
force 

  lovah coming here i asked
but of course jimnos forces will
not be enough

  the whole situation was bathed in a
new light i was light-hearted joe
ready for a lark or a wrestle but now
that my lovah-honey was going to be
involved-well things were shaping
up and not to my liking either

  but holy cats i said even with
lovahs warriors there wont be enough
to make a decent fight

  it will be a combination of several
factors she pointed out in the first
place there will be the element of sur-
prise secondly jimno and lovah will
not attack from the same direction and
thirdly there is the factor of the

paavans  

  i asked what they had to do with it
they were bred not for riding
alone wait she promised you will
see how terrible they can be

  hank got to whispering to her again
so i sat in my little corner and digested
what she told me maybe we had a
chance then i got to thinking of the
parrot and how she was going to man-
age to get him out of lokos clutches
hang it i kept thinking of the bird as
a material being it was lurias father
of course then i thought how silly that
was especially if one said it aloud
then i stopped thinking
queen of the panther world



  again time marched on suddenly i
saw luria place her hand to hanks
lips he stopped talking and i stopped
dreaming she had heard something
something to which our earthly ears
were not attuned she arose with a
movement akin to one of her paavans
she rose lithely and stepped toward the
tent opening the rest of us followed
suit

  they come she whispered i hear
them in my mind i dont know their
plans so be prepared for anything

q he warned us but what happened
 was the last thing i thought would
happen fire arrows   

  there must have been hundreds of
them they fell with tiny hissing sounds
and whatever they touched burst into
flame in an instant the entire com-
pound was a mass of fire and smoke
but we didnt wait to see what was go-
ing to happen next not us we were the
rover boys and gals and we roved but
fast to hell and gone out of there

  a torment of sound stuck our ear-
drums as we hit the open air there were
the terror-stricken sounds of men and
women caught in the inferno and above
those were the horrible screams of ani-
mals tied to stakes and unable to es-
cape a pungent acrid odor came to my
nostrils an odor hard to place until i
brought to mind a roast that had be-
come too well-done

  i was just standing listening open-
mouthed to the horror around me when
i heard a wild scream of exultation al-
most in my right ear i pivoted and saw
luria her face transfigured looking
straight down the avenue formed by the
rows of tents i understood her cry of
triumph when i saw what was sweeping
down the avenue mokar riderless was
in the lead and directly behind him was
lovah and jimno riding neck and neck
in a wild race to get to us first

  mokar paused only long enough for
luria to mount and get hank up behind
her and then headed straight for the
center tent lokos quarters lovah
looking like one of the valkerie only
prettier paused long enough for me to
get on behind then she was off after her
queen she handed me one of the two
swords she held clenched in each of her
dainty though dangerous fists

  she raised hers on high and screamed

  for the queen death to loko and
his

  but it wasnt quite that easy cap-
tain mita and the giant were no stupes
they were caught flat-footed shocked
with surprise but it didnt last long
only long enough for them to start a
dispersal of their forces and the first
thing they did as though they realized
the whole purpose of the attack was
to ring lokos tent with guards we
rode like the six hundred into the jaws
of death

  i dont know how many luria had
at her disposal i had no chance to
count even if i wanted to but certainly
they werent many we hit the outer
shell of the ring with the force of a bat-
tering ram broke through and were
swallowed by the inner rings and baby
were those guys and gals tough loko
hadnt picked these babies for their
kindness to their fellow-beings they
played the woodchoppers ball pretty
good with their stickers

  by some quirk of fate lokos tent
was one of several the fire-arrows had
missed all around us the other tents
blazed in fury i caught a quick glimpse
of them then had no time for anything
but the defense of my life and lovahs
too her arm was swinging a death tune
to whoever was within reach of that
terrible plaything as for me i was also
swinging maybe not with the assurance
or ease of lovah but with as terrible
effect as i said before i had discovered


fantastic adventures

a strange thing about pola my strength
was multiplied ten-fold for some rea-
son and though i did not always hit a
vulnerable spot the power of my blow
when it did land was enough to decide
the issue immediately

  but there was only one of me and
hank the sheer weight of their num-
bers plus the addition of reinforce-
ments which kept arriving lost us the
encounter a shrill whistling sound was
suddenly heard and lovahs face turned
to mine with a dismal look of despair
on it i heard her words

  retreat luria calls retreat

phen her mounts head was turned
and we were racing like the wind
back down the avenue of tents for the
open ground beyond we raced into the
flat and kept running i kept turning
my head and saw jimno my heart
leaped in my throat in sudden terror i
couldnt spot hank or the girl my pulse
raced in time to the bounding paces of
lovahs paavan when i saw them at
last they were the last two out of the
compound like a true queen luria had
waited till the last of her subjects were
away before she retreated

  we continued running at top speed
for quite some time as we raced on-
ward endlessly lovah gave me a resume
of what had happened

  jimno is wonderful a born leader
he caught the rear guards who had been
left in town flat-footed they hadnt a
chance and we mashed them to bits
then we did an abount face ran in dif-
ferent directions met at the rendezvous
and made for the groups which we
knew would be scouring the countryside
for us one by one we smashed them
until at the end they were forced to
join together that was the moment for
the third part of our forces to strike
the enemy was tired we had fought
them to a stand-still and when the fresh

forces attacked they fled only to be
met she ended proudly by the
paavans we let loose aah the terror
and destruction our wondrous paavans
meted out

  i could well imagine id seen those
gigantic panthers at work only a short
while before and what they could do
to human flesh was not pretty

  she went on

       but we were still too-few loko
must have enlisted the aid of every war-
rior on pola more and more kept com-
ing their sheer numbers would have
lost any pitched battle we had to let
off finally then came the message from
our queen   

  i looked from side to side and tried
to gauge how many there were of us it
couldnt be done we were strung out
in a long line and since we were run-
ning in the flat which reminded me of
the prairie of a midwestern state many
of them were out of sight in the hip-
high grass

  are we retreating to some plan i
asked

  yes the great forest lies ahead
not even the bravest of all the warriors
on pola would dare venture in its
depths ambush is only a matter of hid-
ing behind a tree loko isnt that big a
fool

after a while lurias forces
merged until we were no longer
stretched out in a long line although we
were still riding loosely in groups of
ten or twelve both luria and jimno
rode their mounts close so that the three
of our paavans were running abreast

  luria seemed dispirited hank had
his mouth close to her ear and i could
see he was trying to break her mood
maybe i know more about dames than
hank does at any rate i put my two
cents in

  cheer up kid i said we havent
queen of the panther world



lost yet   

  we wont lose at all she said i
wasnt thinking of how the battle
stands its its 

  i divined her worry that silly bird
hm to her it wasnt silly at all it was
her father i kind of grinned and she
noticed it

  he smiles she said grimly he is
more brave even than i thought the
moment is dark and your friend smiles
hank he is a man

  hes a damn fool hank said but
his eyes were twinkling in fondness
henry fondness i called him he just
doesnt know when to worry

  the only thing i worry about is
meeting a deadline for ray palmer i
replied but that wasnt what i was
thinking about i think i know whats
bothering our pretty queen the bird
aha i was right

  she had turned her head in surprise
   well im not raising an issue
understand when i say stop beating
that pretty head against a wall the
bird is just one of the many things that
i dont understand about this place but
you understand thats what counts so
its simple he says hes your father
then surely he wont play tricks with
you loko seemed greatly impressed
with him

  you forget she broke in all loko
has to do is wring the birds neck  
hank was ahead of us both

  he cant hank said the bird is
a symbol known to everyone but unless
a symbol is visual it loses its signif-
icance your father was more than just
smart he gave himself the body of a
bird the likes of which cant be found
anywhere on this planet loko wont be
able to find a substitute so hell have to
let him live he will probably rig some
sort of fol-de-rol about him being the
only one able to understand the birds
words or perhaps the only one who is

allowed to converse with the bird he
cant afford harm to come to the bird
of course my thoughts ran in an al-
together different direction id been
puzzling about the bird without get-
ting any satisfactory answer maybe i
wasnt supposed to but if the old gent
had been such a world-beater in the wis-
dom line he hadnt proved it by doing
what he had what was more i didnt
believe the bird that business of imi-
tating barry fitzgerald and the others
-of course with four or five different
voices he would sound more mysterious
on the other hand if he was that smart
he should have been smart enough to
have known that loko and any one else
who wanted to rule had but to find him
and such a situation that was now at
hand would come about there was
something not very bright about that
bird or something too bright for me
to get

  lovah whispered in an aside to me
i didnt hear her and she repeated
the great forest is at hand very
soon it will welcome us

  i looked ahead and saw a wall of trees
which stood so close together not a
shred of light seeped into their depths

  you could hide an army in there
i said

  as i told you lovah agreed

  but how do we get in i asked
the paavans will find the path this
is where we find them

che spoke the truth about the pan-
thers knowing their way straight
as a die they sped for the solid wall
ahead as we came close the place
looked a little terrifying we had to
stretch out again in a single line luria
took the lead lovah with me grasping
her close about the waist a little more
tightly than usual came next i caught
a glimpse of jimno holding up his
mount i imagined he was going to cover


fantastic adventures

the rear then we were in the damp
darkness of the forest that was really
primeval

  strange cries rang out as we crossed
the border between light and darkness
rank odors filled our nostrils it took
several seconds for our eyes to accus-
tom themselves to the gloom fitful rays
of light seeped through the tangled
foliage but nowhere was to be seen a
single area even a few feet across on
which the blessed sun fell

  as we proceeded deeper i became
aware of hidden creatures some quite
large stalking us from the borders of
brush which were walls too thick to pen-
etrate now and then one of these crea-
tures let out a sound to betray its pres-
ence there were roars which could
come only from the throats of a paavan
shrieks which terrified because one
didnt know or could imagine their own-
ers my hair stood on end for so long
a time i thought it was starched

  where are we bound for i asked
and suddenly realized id spoken in a
whisper

  in a little while we will come to our
trysting place lovah said

  she knew what she was talking about
all right quite suddenly the trees
thinned and i caught a vista of an im-
mense meadow then the trees closed in
again but as though the glimpse of the
promised haven lent wings to the feet
of the paavans they sped forward with
increased speed too much speed be-
cause when we passed the last line of
trees we were traveling at such speed
we couldnt stop or disperse the am-
bush which had been laid for us was
perfect

rip hey must have known of it or
perhaps jimno and lovah hadnt
done such a good job or perhaps more
reasonably they had tortured someone
into telling the hidden secret but they

fell on us with the force of limitless
numbers

  at least ten of them surrounded lo-
vah and myself they were mounted
on the monstrous lizard things in the
still-tangled brush before the open
meadow their mounts had the speed of
ours it was the pay-off i thought as i
began to flay about me with the sticker
lovah had given me

  the ones who surrounded my gal and
me were women for the barest second
i had some misgivings about using the
sword in my fist but only until one of
them missed me with a wild swing
then i swung the blade went through
her like a knife going through soft but-
ter her mount kept moving forward
and for a second her body hung to-
gether then the top half separated
from the bottom and rolled off but i
hadnt time to gloat over it these
dames were crazy theyd spur up and
jab and swing get in each others way
all trying to knock us off at one time
lovah had gone to the proper school
her timing would have made joe louis
green with envy nor did she waste mo-
tions in wild swinging every stroke of
her sword was clipped and sharp if
only i wasnt behind her

  i proved the handicap and the de-
noument for in one of my wild swings
i knocked her off balance and myself
off the paavan i reached wildly with my
free hand tried to maintain a semblance
of equilibrium and in the end got
neither and fell off the women fell on
me with savage screams of exultation
how i managed to fight my way clear
of the forest of cleaver-like blades
which thirsted for my blood is a mys-
tery to me but somehow i did to get
to a nearby tree i wanted the protec-
tion of its thick trunk i knew it was
only a temporary respite still i could
not give up hope

  that i did not escape to my tempo-
queen of the panther world



rary haven without damage went with-
out saying why hank and i had never
exchanged our garments for the more
protective though scantier garb of the
polans i do not know but at that mo-
ment wdth my back to the thick tree
trunk i wished we had i was bleeding
from several nicks and one gash a
sword had ripped across the flesh of my
chest splattering me with a crimson
rain it wasnt a mortal blow only a
flesh wound but i knew that if i didnt
receive attention it would prove damag-
ing far more so than the other wounds
i got

  my shirt hung by scattered slivers of
blood-soaked threads to my body one
sleeve had been torn completely away
the blood had run down into my trou-
sers which were torn by the briars and
looked more ragged than a hobos i
sweated and stank like a draught horse
on a hot summers day and i was be-
seiged by a dozen women who thirsted
for my life the instant i was unmount-
ed six others had come up on the run
i hacked away inexpertly but with tell-
ing damage and gradually the sheer
strength i displayed won both their
admiration and their respect

  i managed a quick glance around
during a short breathing spell we
werent doing so well i could see any
number of riderless paavans of luria
and hank nothing    then they were
at me again once more i took up the
seemingly endless task and this time
it was harder no longer did they come
at me together getting in each others
way fouling up their sword play and
making themselves easy marks for my
blade

  this time they came at me singly
and in quick succession and on danc-
ing feet my swings were a little wilder
a little slower i stopped after a mo-
ment and waited until one came in
range before swinging again they

changed their tactics this time two
came at me at once one from right and
the other from the left and while i
tried to keep both off two more came
from in front i knew it was but a mat-
ter of a short while and they would wear
me down nor was i wrong three times
in a row i got the point of a sword in
me not deeply but damagingly

t had a last resort hy speed afoot

   i could outrun them suddenly i
leaped straight forward i jabbed twice
missed one and got the second and lost
my sword in the maneuver it went in
too deeply and i had no time to pull it
free but i no longer cared for coming
toward me at a full gallop was lovah
i had lost sight of her after i had been
knocked off her paavan i could see as
we rushed to meet each other that she
too had not escaped unscathed from the
fray one arm hung limp there was a
bloody streak across the firm white flesh
of a shoulder but her eyes were ablaze
and her face alight

  we were almost at meetings point
when i suddenly sprawled face down-
ward in the marshy loam i was in a
creeper had tripped me i struggled to
get to my feet but after two tries my
knees gave way and i fell rolling to
my back

  the sky seen through the filigree of
black branches never looked so blue
of course there wereiio clouds just the
cerulean blue which merged into the
gold of the eternal sun all this in the
space of seconds then another some-
thing intruded into the scope of my
vision it was only a sidewise glance
terror and death was coming my way
the most gigantic woman id ever seen
was leaping toward me on huge splay
feet in her hand a sword fully ten feet
long her expression was demoniac with

fantastic adventures

cattle i was powerless to move the
sweat was a sour river pouring down
my face saturating me in its stench i
felt a horror beyond words as she
slid to a halt at my very side then the
sword was lifted high above her head
her both hands clenched about the hilt
   eons went by worlds were born
and died civilizations crumbled and
death marched to mufflled drum beats
and stepped before me and bared its
horrendous snout to my eyes and its
cavernous mouth opened to swallow me
   and the sword shot downward

  i heard the thin screech and swish
of it felt its cold breath on my cheek
but saw it not my eyes were closed for
that infinitesimal instant they opened
and i saw its silvery length quivering
and undulating beside my cheek like a
frustrated pendulum to one side stood
the giantess her hands tight about the
blade of a sword which stuck out of
both sides of her thick throat she was
trying to free her flesh of its grasp
then her hands fell to her sides and a
thick stream of blackish-blood poured
from her mouth her nose her throat
and enveloped her in a redly-funereal
garment

  quickly a voice came from above
me

  i looked dazedly in its direction
there she was my lovah a delight to
my eyes and a balm to my soul and a
saviour of my flesh her hand firm
and strong as a mans reached down
and took my lax fingers and hauled me
erect i let myself go limp across the
thickly-muscled shoulders of her paa-
van her fingers fell lightly across my
sent courage coursing through me i bent
my head back and she brought her face
down and once more our lips met not
as they had before in passion but in
the gentle caress of true love

  her hand lay across my shoulder as
we turned to face the enemy fear had

been banished from our hearts though
our arms were gone from us   

  they surrounded us they were
many and though they were armed and
we were not they moved carefully as
though they could not believe our state
or the fact that there were only two of
us we waited for their stings to bite
us   

  alive take them alive one of
them called unexpectedly the man is
the one who escaped the pit

hp he beast across which i lay stank
to high heaven i was bound hand
and foot and lay belly down across its
rump behind me rode one of the ama-
zons somewhere behind lovah rode
prisoner also now and then we passed
clumps of dead and though it was im-
possible to count them i could see
when the bobbing motion of the elk-
lizard allowed that the greater part of
the heaps of dead were loks people
rather than lurias not that i re-
ceived any consolation from it now
that i had passed safely through
the period of shock following the
battle i could see again with at least
a small measure of equanamity what
lay ahead the future to put it in tech-
nicolor wasnt very bright in fact
someone had exposed the film before
shooting for some reason i had
stopped bleeding i was on the weak
side but at least i wasnt going to bleed
to death hooray for me i thought
theyre probably saving me for a fate
worse than death i wouldnt have given
a hang had it not been for lovah

  oddly enough our ride was shorter
than any i had gone on willfully or oth-
erwise whether my senses had dulled
to time in this strange land or whether
the ride was short it didnt take us
long the pueblos of lokos town hove
into view shortly

  there were lines of people waiting
queen of the panther world



our arrival i could feel their hatred
though i could not see them i could
feel as we passed through the oddly
silent cordon of hating men women and
children that we were the objects of
their hate and possibly of their re-
venge i could understand it too we
jovah and i were the symbols of the
death many of lokos people met oh
it was true that we werent directly re-
sponsible but we were here and we
were prisoner we rode a gamut there
under the hot sun and not a finger was
raised in our defense i heard lovahs
first shriek of pain her first outcry
there were no more i suffered the tor-
tures of the damned until we reached
our goal for from my own experience
i knew what lovah must have gone
through they had used their fists
clubs their teeth and nails and feet on
me stones had pelted me until it seemed
as though there wasnt a whole bone in
my body but i was damned if id let
a single sound of pain escape me and
lovah had allowed only the first cry to
pass her lips

  those were the physical things there
were dirtier nastier things ordure and
worse which stung us but at the end we
came within the orbit of lokos palace
and some small measure of safety from
the browd our bonds were cut and even
as i staggered around on stumbling feet
i saw that lovah was all right but they
gave us no rest once more i met the
long halls and corridors of lokos pal-
ace and once more we were dragged
before the dais on which stood the table
and throne this time loko captain
mita and the giant warrior sat without
their women i gathered it was a change
of time

  loko no longer looked the benevolent
old man his face was no longer benign
or wise it was twisted in an expression
of absolute rage saliva white-frothed
like foam had gathered at the corners

of his mouth and hung suspended like
soap bubbles

  little beasts    animals   
traitors she-devil and he-devil  you
thought to make small of me  but my
trap caught you  ahh that they did
not make it strong enough for the arch-
devil woman luria but she will not
escape long already they seek her   
she will be found by her hair by her
toe nails will i have her dragged before
me and also her consort the devil from
another world    he didnt bring a
magic more powerful than what i pos-
sess

  aah shut up i snarled up at the
shrieking old loon you sound like
youre losing your marbles not that
you ever had any

jt y words stopped the tirade i
thought i caught a gleam of ad-
miration in mitas eyes but the old
man had the floor and he was going to
keep it suddenly he grinned and i no-
ticed for the first time that he had no
teeth well after all if i were as old as
he i dont imagine id have any either

  the fool teaches the wise he said
you are quite right my friend   

  dont call me friend i said sharply

   i permitted my emotions the up-
per hand but only for the moment in
anger now they must savor another
pleasure this one however i had
promised myself on your first escape i
had thought to hold myself until i had
your friend and the woman luria alto-
gether  

  once more i broke in

  ill never dance at your wedding
you old goat but i hope to caper at your
funeral

     but since that isnt possible at
this moment i will contain myself for
the present of course i must have the
satisfaction of a partial enjoyment
slaves the whips


fantastic adventures

  i was too weak to fight i was too
weak to even stand but i was damned
if id give way not so long as there was
breath in my body or so i thought

  they bound us together face to face
not just our hands and feet but strands
of wire-rope about our waists and legs
also i could see the man who had the
whip to be used on lovah and she could
see the one who was to do the dirty work
on me but neither could see their re-
spective whippers they shoved us
around until they had us satisfactorily
arranged to lokos liking

  lean your head on my shoulder i
said if it gets bad honey take a good
bite out of my shoulder cry sing do
anything but scream i wont be able to
take that  

  all the time i was talking i was wait-
ing i had an idea the old devil on the
dais was going to give the signal for the
torture to begin by a nod of his head
his mind operated that way it was the
reason why he had us placed in profile
to those on the platform he knew the
psychological torture we were going
through

  i had always wondered what could
be the most terrible thing in the world
i found it out then waiting just plain
waiting for anything especially when
you know its going to be unpleas-
ant i could get a very unsatisfactory
glimpse of loko and the others from a
corner of one eye it wasnt enough to
define movements or even to see the
shake of a head but i could see them
as the seconds dragged by i tried to
turn my head to ee more the men who
had bound us were masters of their art
so subtly had they wrought with the
strands of wire rope that though i could
move my head it was only to the part
of an inch more and i would strangle

  my attention was suddenly focused
on the bronzed giant who was standing
whip in hand behind lovah the mus-

cles in his arms and shoulders were like
those of some atlas he had stood im-
passive and immobile while others had
pushed us about suddenly he flexed
his arms the muscles rippling flesh-
like-water the immensely long whip
coiled writhingly on the stone floor as
though it were a snake in agony i saw
then that the lash was divided in three
parts like a very long thonged leash
he raised the whip and moved it about
faster and faster until it began to sing
in the air suddenly he snapped it the
sound was like that of a pistol shot
lovah who was unaware of what was
going on gave a startled movement of
fear i looked in her eyes and grinned

  gonna be tough i said i love
you honey    its a hell of a time to
say that but maybe itll help

  love she whispered it is a
strange word but we have such a word
here if i think it is what you mean i
love you too man of another world
you are the first i have ever said that
to nor will i ever say it to another i
was afraid only this moment but now
why it is as though fear never existed
are we not together are we not bound
to each other body to body surely if
it is within the bounds of reason so
will our souls be bound but not with
strands of rope but with the infinitely
greater fibres of love as you call it do
not worry man of mine i will not cry
out though they beat me to eternity
if i had had tears i would have shed
them if i had had the strength to tear
myself from the prison they had bound
me in i would have ripped their tor-
ture cell to bits and them with it but
i could not i could do nothing but
wait wait    the terror of
a word which becomes a
something physical   

t hen there was no more waiting

  the word had been translated into
queen of the panther world



the deed i heard the swish of the fibre
snake it made an eerie whistling
sound as it zipped through the air and
hit 

  for an instant the shock was so great
i could do nothing say nothing all i
could do was feel once i had written
of liquid fire being poured on someone
i suddenly knew how that hero of the
pulps felt pain was like ecstasy pain
was like suddenly losing the world one
was in and in an instant being brought
into another world i didnt even hear
the sound of the second stroke only
the feel of it

  pain became translated into some-
thing else colors first there was
blackness just an oily pool of black
into which your mind sank that was
with the first blow the second brought
a tinge of red into the blackness after
the third i stopped counting just the
colors and the pain reds and purples
and black always the black like a cur-
tain which burned when one went be-
hind of and out of it

  the pain was something else it al-
ways began with the area which had
been hit then spread it was like the
thin sound of a single violin string
which had been plucked the sound
leaps from the thin wood panelling and
spreads instantly in all direction so
with the pain i felt every single inch
of me vibrated to the feel of pain

  of a sudden i heard a voice

  well maybe it wasnt a voice i
heard maybe it could best be called
a sound surely i would have thought
had i been capable of thinking noth-
ing like that could be called a voice
it wasnt human nor was it animal i
knew what it was though it was the
sound of pain it was the cry of the
tortured and the damned it was the
sound of man being beaten whipped
terrorized it was the cry of all human-
ity wrapped up in a single throat

   oh do not think there is no limit
to pain there is i began to develope
an odd immunity to it not that it
wasnt always present only it became
pushed into the background taking its
place as though in compensation a
new world was conceived it was a
strange world there were only three
people in it loko lovah and myself

  the first glimpse i had of this
strange world took place as though on
a screen which had been shoved onto
my mind of a sudden we were in some
sort of cave the walls glowed redly
from the reflections of hidden fires
lovah stark-naked was dancing about
a figure bound to a stake she was
brandishing a pitchfork another figure
stalked in from off stage somewhere i
recognized myself i watched myself
move forward toward the nude figure
cavorting about the stake and the man
tied to it then i wasnt watching any-
more i was myself walking toward
lovah she was singing a tune but the
words did not make sense

   old lokos hanging from a stake
   old lokos but a broken rake

   soon hell fry

   we must turn him

   soon hell fry

   soon well burn him

   old lokos hanging from a stake
brittle bones bones will break
from ten feet off i took an immense
leap like that of a male ballet dancer
and landed beside lovah

   ho-ho i chortled we have the
old buzzard now havent we my pet
i worked hard over the fires but theyll
make the labor worth it when we fry
him have you pricked him to see how
the juice runs

   lovah did a pirouette completely
around the old man tied to the stake
she laughed gayly and a deep groan
echoed the light sound the groan came
from loko at the sound lovah


fantastic adventures

stopped dancing and i came close

  please the old man said spare
this old greybeard   

  grey beard i said in fine scorn
why there isnt a hair on that bald
dome of yours and not even fuzz on
that chiny-chin-chin you call a chiny-

chin-chin

  rhetoric the old man replied
merely rhetoric a phrase a passing
thought but and this is more to the
point surely you would not harm an
old old man like me

  lovah and i burst into delighted
queen of the panther world



laughter she whirled lightly about me
and came to rest at my side her eyes
laughing up to mine and her ilps invit-
ing a kiss i accepted the invitation
loko groaned at sight of it

oh dont pay any attention to the
old frastrate lovah said hes just

jealous hes just jealous because were
going to eat and he isnt  

  ho-ho i laughed again he isnt
going to eat hes just going to be the
eaten

  spare me spare me the old jerk
groaned

fantastic adventures

  spear him spear him he says
spear himmmmm 

rt he words died away in a long
humming sound the scene faded
the world of fantasy collapsed only
the hum remained i came back to real-
ity to the sound of that hum and
found it was i who was making the
sound

       berk  oh man of mine   
please hear me   

  her cheeks were dew-wet against
mine from the tears she had she her
voice was a sobbing entreaty which i
could not deny strange i thought and
it was the first time in the eons which
had passed that i had been able to
bring thought to my tortured mind i
can no longer feel the whip

  her voice went on her breath tick-
ling my neck

     stop doing that berk not any
more i cant stand it ill break too if
you dont stop  

  its stopped honey i said guess
i went off the deep end what hap-
pened the guy get tired

  her head went back and her eyes
were bright as stars and twice as beau-
tiful her lips managed a smile but
two last tears coursed down the paths
others had sown and hung poised like
wondrous jewels on the curve of her
cheeks i would have given the breath
of my life to lift my hands and brush
them into a cup to hold precious for-
ever

  n-no i think you fainted and loko
told him to stop

  well that was nice of loko i cant
say that i dont appreciate it im puz-
zled though   

  her eyes asked a question

     my back i said it should
at least smart but i dont feel a thing
hey maybe im just numb from tak-
ing it

  no they covered you with some
sort of salve i saw them place it on
you

  ho slaves loko suddenly an-
nounced he was still alive undo the
bonds about the two but leave them
bound

  they turned us so that we were fac-
ing the three up there that is i thought
there were three it turned out there
were four the fourth was one of the
women warriors she was leaning over
lokos shoulder talking earnestly to
him in low tones accenting with her
hands actions she wanted to bring to
light the other two were listening ab-
sorbedly also loko kept shaking his
head as though in agreement after a
moment of this she turned and leaped
from the dais and strode from the room

  the three then brought their heads
together and after several seconds of
talk mita and the other also rose and
departed loko turned his full atten-
tion to us

  i suppose i must forego the balance
of this he said matters of state have
come up of interest to you two also
the she-devil luria and the rest of
them will soon be in my clutches per-
haps it is best that i save the two of
you for the time when there will be
other rebels and traitors to keep you
company throw them into adjoining
cells so that they might hear each
others agony  

hp he instant the cell door clanged
- shut i rushed to the bars and called
to lovah

  all right baby

  oh yes but now that the ordeal
is at end for you i feel this prison we
must break loose somehow

  she had a great idea my lovah
honey had there was but one thing
wrong with it when hank and i had
been thrown into this clink they just
queen of the panther world



left us there not this time directly
outside our doors about midway be-
tween them stood a guard against the
opposite wall and now and then i saw
the shadow of a marching man pass
across the outside bars of our little
cages

i think were stuck here for a
while i said but always remember
that what sticks you can get unstuck
it was small consolation but it had
to do

  the sound of the warders who had
brought us to our cells died away in the
distance the oddly quivering stillness
of the prison settled on us i started to
turn from the bars to see what the land
looked like on the outside when i saw
our guard approaching he placed his
face close to the door bars and whis-
pered

  loko is a traitor

  yeah i said i know  i
stopped and the light burst on me one
of lokos own men calling him a trai-
tor hope kindled anew in my breast
lovah must have seen the man step to
my cell but she couldnt hear what was
being said

  aye the guard said a deep-dyed
traitor he has lied to us the holy
bird has said so i heard it   

  so i acted with reserve

  it is not right he tells the people
the holy bird says he is the rightful
ruler

  so why dont you spill the beans
i mean speak up tell someone who
can do something about it

  he would have me killed the
guard said

 does anyone beside you know
this i asked

  yes my brother he was with me
when news of your capture came to
him he told the holy bird in his mean
gloating voice about it it was then we
heard loko must have forgotten our

presence

  where is your brother now i
asked

  he will relieve me soon the man
said

  and you in turn will relieve him
i asked

  yes

  do you think you can bring the
bird to me i asked

  he shook his head that he could i
smiled but his face and eyes remained
grim loko has gone on the field it
is said that his forces have surrounded
the rightful queen luria it will be
some time before he returns i will re-
turn soon

  nor was it long before the brother
showed up he brought with him trays
of food for us the two of them divid-
ed up the time waiting on us which
amounted to their shoving the bowls
into our cells and waiting until we were
done then the first gathered up the
empty bowls and went off

  i paced the cell in what seemed in
endless procession until his return he
carried the bird in the open and
marched straight up to the cell thrust
the bird in on me and said

  loko will wonder greatly where the
bird is nor will he know for a length
of time perhaps by then he may find
the means to escape him until then be
at peace

 wanted to kiss the character

  what a sweet guy be at peace it
was a long time since id heard that
phrase i looked down at the parrot on
my wrist the blamed bird seemed
asleep carrying carefully i stepped
out of sight of the man on the outside
the cell our new-found friend had been
careful to make the transfer during the
time the outside guard was out of
sight

  my bunk was below window level i


fantastic adventures

sat down and peered at the parrot
suddenly one eye opened and blinked
several times as though brushing the
sleep from its lids then the other eye
showed life also we regarded each
other without change of expression for
several seconds the bird was the first
to break silence

  youre about the ugliest man ive
ever seen it said

  i hadnt known what to expect from
it certainly not that i felt the heat rise
all the way from my toes to my face
as if i wasnt having enough trouble
this scrawny thing had to give me
more

  brother i said every time you
open your yap every time you crack
that way you lose ten years from your
life expectancy now why cant you
behave

  the truth will out the bird said
nobody asked for it i said my
voice rising a bit

  i was just thinking of the future
the bird said the day of the woman
is past loko cant lose my daughter
can but stave off defeat for a certain
length of time the inevitable must
happen  

  a laugh that was as bitter as gall
choked me up for the first time since
wed come to this infernal place de-
spair bored a hole in my breast this
bird was telling the truth and we were
going to pay the consequences my
hand fell and the bird hopped off my
wrist and onto the bed i saw then that
its wings had been clipped loko
thought of everything

       no it went on loko cant
lose yet oddly he cant win a para-
dox no

  who cares i asked

  you do he said you want to
five dont you the girl in the cell next
door she makes life worth the strug-
gle doesnt she

  i lifted my head

  you have been beaten whipped
wounded all in vain you fought back
but you lost now you have a valid
reason for fighting i can see through
the veil of time but because the veil
is not of one thickness alone i cannot
see all the way this i can see a level
plain bound on two sides by a forest
on the third by a river and the fourth
side by a deep valley

  two armies are drawn up on the
plain they clash and all is confusion
all is terror and all is lost to sight be-
cause they have lost their integral dis-
tinctions they are mixed and are one
now they separate into distinct groups
each fighting an individual war of its
own now from the forest comes a new
force they are mounted on paavans
and they are all men they ride like a
spearhead of fate into the thick of the
warring groups they ride close slash
off segments of these groups and ride
off before retaliation can be given at
their head rides a bareheaded man with
the face of an eagle his eyes are alight
with the look of a conqueror and his
set features have the look of judgment
now others rally around his standards
he becomes a wedge driving his sword
points deep into the heart of his enemy
they scatter and flee and from all sides
are beset by their opponents and
chopped to bits

  now i see something which was not
plain before a woman and man had
been the leaders before they are no
longer there they have disappeared i
see them again and they are bound to
the mounts of a fleeing couple the
woman is unconscious  

 divined what he was trying to

  tell me luria and hank i rose
and slammed my fist into the wall and
the grey dust powdered and flaked
around my fist
queen of the panther world



       they are met by a company of
warriors riding toward the scene of
battle now all turn and make full
speed toward the rear and in the lead
is an old man a man i once knew full
well loko  

  i bent my head

  ive got to get out of here i grit-
ted harshly do you understand ive
got to get out of here and take lovah
with me

  once you learned your strength
the bird said have you forgotten it
i lifted him to my shoulders his
clawed clutch bit deep into the flesh yet
i didnt notice it i waked straight to
the door and clutched with both hands
at the bars their coldness seemed to
defie me the guard looked at me with
wonder in his eyes

  the one outside will see you he
said with apprehension

  open the door i said were get-
ting out of here

  i could read the indecision in his eyes
now i heard the shouted warning of the
one at the window he had seen the bird
on my shoulder i couldnt risk waiting
setting my feet firmly i yanked with a
sudden pull in which all my strength
was exerted there was a ripping sound
as the door was pulled from the stone
and i staggered backward the weight
of the metal frame in my two hands
hurling it to one side i leaped forward
to face the astonished guard

  with us    i asked

  he made up his mind yes my
brother too shall i get him

  yes quickly but leave me your
sword and open the other cell first
lovah flew into my arms and buried
her head on my shoulders i let her rest
there for a few seconds i could hear
the bellowing voice of the man outside
grow faint as he sped to spread the
alarm but we had to wait the coming
of the brothers but they did not come

alone there were others with them a
dozen others all armed and all willing
to lay down their lives the instant they
saw the bird lovah was given a sword
and with one of the brothers in the lead
we started on the road to freedom

  where are we bound for i asked
as we ran full speed down the twisting
lengths of the corridors

  the throne room one of the broth-
ers replied loko has returned with
luria and the stranger who came with
you from the other world

  the news lent wings to our already
flying feet then i noticed that we
werent running by the same path id
been taken suspicion raised its head in
my breast as though reading my mind
the one in the lead gasped

  the other way wed meet those com-
ing to bar our path this way is longer
but safer

  he was right

  we rushed into the throne room from
a side entrance but one that was all the
way at the far end so intent were those
in the room on what was taking place
before the dais they didnt even see us
i could understand their intent

  hank and luria were in the same po-
sition as lovah and i had been only a
short time before the only difference
being that they were not bound to-
gether further they had been made to
kneel before loko and the other two
loko was on his feet a look of mad fury
on his wrinkled face his arms were
raised above his head and i could hear
the thin screech of his voice all the way
across the room

  you will not die quickly i promise
that i will make life drain from your
bodies as the sweat labors from it on
heaty days i will have my revenge-
i will make it last to your bitter end

   they will come too late and seeing
your lifeless bodies will give up the
struggle  


fantastic adventures

t t e stopped warned by the shouts
of the guards and the two men be-
side him he took one look at us turned
and scampered backward to seek refuge
behind his warrior men

  in an instant a solid wall of guards
had been formed before the two cap-
tives we hit them and it was like plow-
ing into an immensely thick rubber
band we hit and bounced back this
time i took the lead when we charged
forward again i swung my sword like
a man swings a reaper and whatever it
touched became two my men seemed
charged with the same fury as i they
hacked and stabbed with terrible effect
but once more we were too few reason
and sanity left me i was a wild animal
strange sounds came from my throat
screams of madness shouts of deliri-
um fear was plain on the faces of those
facing me for a few moments they gave
before my attack enough for me to win
to the sides of the kneeling man and
woman it took just the time of two
sword swipes and they were free then
they were at my side and swinging
with me

  more and more guards kept joining
in the fray we were outnumbered fifty
to one but not for long suddenly there
were shouting voices voices which sent
echoes of luria echoing about the
stone walls and from all sides warriors
streamed in to join the battle lurias
warriors

  our opponents melted from our sight
streaming to join their leaders in flight
but not for long we had captain mita
and the giant who had sworn to do
things to hank and me to reckon with
even from my small experience in this
pest-hole i knew what a maze it was
we discovered it was a perfect place for
defense each corridor had been built
with that purpose in mind ten men
could hold back a hundred in their nar-
row reaches and there were dozens of

corridors

  we had won the throne room but we
had also won to the heart of lokos em-
pire we soon discovered that we had
not won a complete victory it might
we also discovered become a pyrhic
victory loko was a long way from giv-
ing up the struggle

  ever since we had been rescued from
the tented compound where we had been
prisoner i had wondered why the use
of bow and arrow had not been more
universal later i was told that they
had not as yet become proficient in its
use lokos men were or those he had
trained suddenly a hail of arrows met
our advancing forces it was only for-
tunate that we were not in the open
as it was those barbed shafts kept us
at bay and once more it was jimno
who devised an impromptu escape from
them

  small groups he shouted taking
the play away from luria as naturally
as though it had been god-given six
and eight to each go low - and
keep moving stab and go on dont let
yourselves be targets

  as though they had been trained in
the new maneuver for a lifetime they
folowed the command to perfection
now when a man or woman fell it was
a single one and not as before by fives
and sixes

  but still it was hack and chop loko
or rather mita had enough sword fod-
der to keep us busy i had learned a lot
about the use of a sword i no longer
swung it in wild circles hoping to catch
someone in the radii now i jabbed and
chopped my sword and i were covered
with blood lovah too was finding re-
venge for the indignities shed suffered

  at last the corridor we had found
ourselves in came to an end we were
on the parapet which encircled lokos
pueblo palace our enemies were fleeing
from us for the first time i saw a means
queen of the panther world



of escape which i hadnt seen before
ladders had been placed against the
walls men streamed like firemen down
these ladders

rt he chase continued but it was a
little more even now now we were
in the open where the archers had a
chance at us but they were not too pro-
ficient in the use of the bow the arrows
were indiscriminate in their choice of
victims and they found their friends
as quickly as their enemies

  we won through the hail of steel and
forced our way to the ladders soon
each ladder had its quota of lurias
warriors in command nor did it take
long before we were on the stretch of
ground below and continuing the chase
it was only then that we learned jim-
nos genius

  he had thought of everything from
above came a shrill imperious whistling
and from the great grassy plain sur-
rounding lokos city came a horde of
paavans

  i dont know how many there were
or how jimno had gone about calling
them but come they did in an irresist-
ible wave which swept away all who
opposed them until they arrived within
the precincts of the city itself here
they were met by those trying to flee
pandemonium is a mild way of saying
what followed

  but all this is what happened at the
shrill calling of the paavans what took
place with us directly is as follows we
followed so close on the heels of our
enemies they had no chance to cut the
ladders from us there were some who
were able to but not many those who
were on the ladders at the time friend
and foe alike met a quick death below
for the drop was all of seventy feet

  we won our way to the bottom at
our head jimno strode like an avenging
angel i suppose the memory of what

happened to his wife and children was
never to be forgotten nor would the
enemy ever forget the flashing sword
which took a dozen lives for every one
exacted of his we followed close be-
hind and chopped away after him it
seemed we were invincible they fell as
the leaves fall in the wake of a storm
they retreated until we backed them
up against a rear wall of the palace
pueblo itself

  there were a hundred of them against
perhaps fifty of us the odds were even

  we paused all together as though
drawing the last breath and strength
for the ensuing struggle for it was in
each of our minds that it was to be to
the death then as though motivated
by a single being we leaped for each
other whether by chance or intent
hank and i were opposed by the giant
and captain mita mita was my oppo-
nent

  all it took was a single stroke on my
part to know that i was at the short
end of a long ride he parried my
clumsy jab and had it not been for a
stroke of sheer luck the engagement
would have ended then and there his
foot slid forward at the same time his
sword did but someone alongside
kicked him in trying to get out of the
way of a blow and that tiny instant of
break in the rhythm of his riposte
allowed his parry to slide past me just
under my shoulder

  i leaped backward to safety

  i knew then i had but a single chance
slash and keep slashing with the utmost
disregard for safety and depend on his
being on the defensive all the time
sooner or later by sheer strength i
might wear him down it sounded good
in my brain it even started off well

  i whirled my sword so fast it was but
a streak of light and as i had hoped
he kept on the retreat but why was he
grinning suddenly he stepped in-


fantastic adventures

slid in would be a better way of describ-
ing the movement he made he jabbed
easily somehow avoiding my clumsy
blows the sword tip pricked me and
blood began to flow again and again
he managed to evade my thrusts and
slashes and every time he came in he
departed with a little more of my blood
leaking from various parts of my an-
atomy he was toying with me

  after a while i began to gasp a bit
breath was becoming harder to catch
he motioned me forward saying

  come you have only felt the tip
thus far the edge is keener will make
life depart the quicker you have lived
long enough soon your time will
end  

to hell with it i thought a guy
a can live but once and lovah or
not if my time was now thats the way
it would have to be i dove forward
again and by sheer force broke through
his guard made him retreat i even
managed to get in a couple of digs of
my own yet he always managed to
evade the death thrust

  once more i had to stop to regain a
spent breath and saw for the first time
realized then what he had forced me
into doing he had retreated all right
but in the direction he wanted and in
so doing he had forced me to go along
now his back was against the wall of
the palace and i was in the sun his
sword danced merrily in front of my
eyes and seemed to shoot sparks into
them

    you have courage my friend he
said it is a pity that i have to kill you
but first i must kill that thing on your
shoulder  

  the bird i thought suddenly it was
still perched on my shoulder its claws
still dug into my flesh and for the first
time i felt the bite of them softly to my
ears came the last words of the bird

lurias father

  this time death will be final for me
tell luria this world is done for her
and say that the world she will go to
has no need of women warriors   

  they were the last utterance he
made in a movement that was but a
play of light too quick for my eyes to
follow mita brought his sword forward
with a gentle but lightning-like move-
ment of his wrist i did my best to leap
out of its way but the blade was not
seeking me it found its mark all right
a spatter of warm liquid struck against
my cheeks and from the corner of my
eye i saw the head of the holy groana
bird fall to the ground then i no
longer felt its claws in my shoulders
flesh the mystery of it would never be
solved now

  so be it mita said the time has
come my friend now

  he danced forward and his blade
flickered toward me now toward my
throat and now toward my chest but
always to return as i danced awkwardly
aside but he was no longer smiling
at my movements suddenly he snaked
forward bent a little lower than usual
and shot out one leg and arm in a
simultaneous gesture i made the mis-
take of following the direction of his
leg  i dont know about this busi-
ness of a drowning man seeing his life
flash backward before him as he goes
down but this i know

  the dust of this place had a bitter
taste - the sun was a blast furnace
for death to enter - and the shadow
-there was a voice calling to me the
voice of my beloved and i had not the
breath to answer-a pointed bit of
steel was leaping to find a spot in me
of the great destroyer crossed the face
of the sun   

  my sword fell to the earth my eyes
were suddenly too tired to stay open
yet too horrified too amazed to close
queen of the panther world



i knew who had cast the shadow mo-
kar as though he had been shot from
the blue he had come in a tremendous
leap to land full on mita one snap of
those terrible jaws and mitas life had
escaped in a cascade of gore mita had
spoken the truth the time had come
his time

  i turned wearily just in time to see
the last of the great drama loko was
pinned against the wall not far from me
hank was just stepping away from the
headless body of the giant luria and
jimno were facing loko and lovah
was running toward me with the grace
and speed of a gazelle

  i took her in my arms and she was
limp for a second her fingers explored
my wounds and her eyes lit up and her
lips gave a sigh as she saw that i was
only nicked

  we moved arm in arm toward the
frozen tableaux

  loko was pleading for his life a
broken stream of words which sounded
oddly profane from lips which had
caused so many to die they were the
sounds of a babbling idiot

  luria was a pale-faced ghost now
that the die was cast she saw that the
bird was missing from my shoulder and
at the nodding of my head knew it was
dead her lips thinned and determina-
tion made her jaws go square

  throw him a sword she said

  the blade lay at the old mans feet
he didnt even look at it begging
words dripped from his mouth broken-
voiced promises which had no meaning
suddenly jimno pushed the girl gently
aside saying

  it is not meet for a queenly blade
to be defiled his flesh would rot the
steel tarnish its color he is but car-
rion even in life no better dead
surely  

  loko died more quickly than did
most to whom he had ordered death 

jmjria hank was saying there
is nothing here for you anymore
jimno has proven a right to rule its
better that way  

  we were sitting about the four of us
lovah hank the beautiful girl who
had been the queen and i jimno was
rounding up the last of lokos forces
lovah found the hollow of my arms and
was content there

  but my people she protested
they will live and well too hank
said jimno is wise and great he is a
poet remember but also a warrior he
proved that he won his right to a king-
ship let the days of a womans rule
end

  she turned her face to his and he
smiled and went on

  except for the rule over me you
have always been my queen in my
heart you wil always reign but in my
land how much greater and more en-
during will it be

  i have the power she said aloud
perhaps   

  we became tense as she turned and
gave us each a look of intense search
then her lips framed a smile and she
continued close your eyes all of you
and let us pray we return to that place
from whence you came 

  it was evening we were in a large
city skyscrapers were framed against
the cloud-studded sky we were not
far from water i could hear it slapping

against a pier----then i saw the white

wonder of the wrigley building we
were home again

	 

  lovah knows what it means to be
a writers widow a week has gone by
since our return she has wanted to go
out every night but every night i say
cant honey got to finish this for

  and always the same words from her

ikhnatons revolution

    by fran ferris 

the great egyptian pharoah amenhotep
the magnificent died about  bc and
was buried in the valley of the kings
tombs this great pharoah who presided over the
splendor of the noble city of thebes and who
made his name ring in egyptian history was not
noted for what he was but rather for what he did
primarily as a military strategist at his death
egypt was a gigantic empire consisting of asia
minor egypt and nubia a mighty man was
required to hold together this heterogenous entity

  amenhoteps son amenhotep iii more often
called ikhnaton was the direct opposite of his
father where his father was a bold and brave
military leader taking by force what he wanted
and seldom giving thought to anything but con-
quest ikhnaton was the philosopher the dreamer
the idealist the man of profound thought

  he immersed himself not in the study of his
mighty empire but in the thought of time and he
was more interested in the philosophizing of the
priests than in the course of his nation but in
his way the man is a most remarkable man among
pharoahs we think of him as an individual
not a name before a state

  his position of prominence comes from the fact
that almost single-handedly he changed egyptian
religion previously all egyptian religion had the
elementary concepts of gods presiding over given
human function for example architecture the
god ptah was supposed to have guided the con-
struction of the beautiful objects dart that were
prepared beneath the temple of memphite

  but it was the belief of the pharoah to change
this he believed that the gods were not only the
guides of such work but the very inspirers and
directors ptah thus became not merely the
patron of the art of architecture but its very
fountainhead he was the master-workman the
architect of the universal all designs and all
beauty stem from him this idea met with severe
opposition at first but gradually ikhnaton by
the magic of his personality and his oratory
swung the priests beliefs in his direction

xto god however had ever been claimed as the
god of the empire re or ra god of the

sun was the nearest approach to that but in some
subtle sense which we do not yet fully understand
he was not the major figure ikhnaton identified
his new god the god of the empire with the old
amon the sun-god the ra he called this god
aton lord of the sun the symbol of the god
was the usual radiating disk

  then to destroy his fathers constant reference
to amon ikhnaton went so far as to obliterate
that name as best he could from the entire city
his success was excellent even the sacred writ-
ings on the tombs of his ancestors were eliminated

  this done he assigned cities in asia in egypt
and in nubia to the god-they were dedicated so
to speak to the furtherance of his worship be-
cause the pharoahs word was absolute there was
little difficulty in enforcing this new god on his
subjects

  so absorbed was ikhnaton in his religious work
that he almost ignored the dissolution of the
egyptian empire hittite tribes from the east
were beginning to worry at the flanks of the
egyptian lion and the descent of egypt was at
hand ikhnaton did nothing the results were
apparent at once charioteers swept through his
empire and conquered it with little or no trouble
that is they conquered those portions of the
empire which they coveted which fortunately was
not egypt itself

  ikhnaton died not in hiding for he was still a
pharoah but all egypt cursed his memory and he
was known as the criminal of akhetaton this
was a terrible appellation because he was an intel-
lectual who did nothing while his world vanished
about him his people were prone to look upon
him with contempt but this much at least may
be said  he was a thinker and an idealist

  bloody as is the history of ancient egypt it was
and is a novelty to find anyone so concerned with
the things of the spirit as has often been men-
tioned the egyptians were almost always con-
cerned with material gain-their spiritualistic atti-
tude and their absorption with religious matters
was merely a cover-up for their intensely acquisi-
tive activities not so for ikhnaton he may have
let an empire fall but he at least thought

  
the mighty amazon

by h r stanton

the amazon river in south america is the
greatest one in the world it has been
called many different names by the various
tribes living along their portion it was given
the name of amazon by the explorer orellana
who named it after a tribe of warriors that had
exceptionally large wives who helped their hus-
bands in battles

  the full length of the amazon is approximately
 miles it varies in width but where it
enters the atlantic it is  miles wide the
amazon drains more than  square miles
a territory nearly as large as the united states
as the amazon lies within a tropical zone there
is uninterrupted plant growth throughout the
year their excessive rainy season is during our
winter and some sections have  inches of
rainfall a year it flows at a rate of two and
one-half miles an hour and much faster during
the floods which occur each year the amazon
and its connecting rivers form the largest system
of inland water-ways in the world

  within the basin of the amazon there are layers
of rocks and sandstone of varying height this

 peruvian myth

by jon barry

there is an old legend of collas a peru-
vian tribe about pacari tampu the
house of the dawn from the caverns
of pacari tampu there came four brothers and a
sister the oldest boy climbed a mountain and
threw out stones in all directions to signify that
he had taken possession of the land the other
three brothers were envious of him and the
youngest brother succeeded in inducing him to
enter a cave when he was inside he rolled a
big stone in front of the mouth of the cave and
imprisoned the eldest brother there forever on
a pretense of searching for his lost brother he
had one of the other brothers climb a high moun-
tain from which he cast him and as be fell by
use of black magic changed him into a stone
the third brother sensed that there was treach-
ery and fled the first brother symbolized the
oldest known peruvian religion that of the thun-
der god pachacamac the second that of an in-
termediate fetishism or stone-worship the third
the cult of viracocha the water-god the fourth
seems to be the more modern sun-worship which
in the end triumphed over all the rest as is proved
by the younger brother whose name was pirrhua
manca which means son of the sun

shows that at one time a local mediterranean sea
covered the amazon lowland territory and its
shallow outlet into the western sea gradually be-
came filled in

  this mighty river pours five milli jn gallons of
water per second into the atlantic ocean along
with all this water is carried tons of sediment
every twenty-four hours there is enough to form
a solid cube  feet each way during the flood
season villages even though they are built on
high posts are practically unindated natives
paddle their canoes right into their houses

  because of the hot moist climate there is lux-
uriant plant growth among this dense tangle
of vegetation live many practically unknown
tribes they are savage and cannibalistic they
hunt with clubs bow and arrow and blow-guns
which shoot tiny sharp poisoned arrows that
cause instant paralysis

  the plants grow uninterrupted year after year
till they attain monstrous size the enormous
trees along the banks of the river are interwoven
with vines and roots and hanging with moss to
create a fantastic picture

x-ray eyes

by pete bogg

there is a young man living in johannes-
burg who seems to have x-ray eyes for he
is able to discern the presence of minerals
in many places where even the experts have been
in doubt he is now employed by a south af-
rican gold mining syndicate and his job is to
search for new mining sites for them this would
be quite a task for sixteen year old pieter van
jaarsveld if it werent for his x-ray eyes

  when he was taken for his first visit to a dia-
mond mine he became ill with a headache caused
by a blue shimmering haze above the diamond
pit no one else had ever noticed any blue haze
and they were puzzled by his words he said he
had never seen any thing just like it before but
that he had seen black ridges shimmering over a
gold mine before that had given him the same
kind of a headache several tests were made by
taking the boy to mines and to prospective mines
which proved that he did see phenomena that no-
body else saw black ridges danced over ground
where gold was buried and white ridges indicated
that there was water underground but the blue
shimmering haze always indicated diamonds he
has been publicized in the johannesburg news-
papers as the boy with the x-ray eyes


mirrors of the queen

by richard s shaver

    it was a simple vanishing act wish
trick mirrors and lola stepping through
them-fasit this time she failed to return 

i was helping backstage setting up
scenery when i first saw the queen
her real name was lola murphy
but her act was billed the golden
queen in the burlesque circuit

  so naturally she was the queen
to all the troupers and believe me she
looked the part do i have to tell you
what queen of the strippers looks like
you dont even know where are you
from anyway

  she had everything tall and perfect
and young she danced like an opium
eaters dream-and she had golden
natural blonde hair to go with it-and
plenty of it the queen would be bet-
ter known today than christine ayres
if this hadnt happened    she had
more instead of languid perfection she
had a dynamic rhythm the song of life
was born in her to be movement   
i fell

  she was headed for the top musical
comedy movies everything would have
come her way agents were after her
even then but she avoided them she
wasnt figuring on a change i some-
times think this was because of me in
fact i know it she could have had
anybody she wanted but she took a
shine to me

  ive had a little stage experience
and when the queen found out i used
to work for a magician she had an idea

  i was spending one of my few re-

maining dollars over the burlesque
bar next to the trocadero in philly
when the queen took the stool next to
me at the bar

  as usual when she appeared on my
horizon my eyes popped my mouth
sagged open in simple admiration and
other things so that i am just able to
whisper to the barkeep another tom
collins pal just as if that didnt
mean i was going to be broke and out
of fodder money before payday i could
tell to a meal just how far that pay
check would go and it was gone here
and now

  then i turned on the charm and
began to unwind what meagre salami
i could slice for the queens benefit

  im frank marr demon magician
master of illusion and apparition you
never knew that did you lola

  i did not but there are a few things
i could learn yet you might even have
money to pay for these drinks but ill
have to see it to believe it

  uneagerly i shelled out my last re-
maining bit of well worn cabbage
queenie laughed i said-well a guy
dont make much moving scenery and
sweeping out  if i was in the
dough like you itd be different

  the queen sort of measured me with
an eye

  i see at liberty one magician
why didnt you say so the queen





fantastic adventures

put my money back in my hand and
paid the bar-keep she was sharp

  youre not much of a magician or
youd have more money when did you
work last i mean aside from that
bums relief job of yours

  it has been quite a while

  i could get you a job with us you
could fill in while we change etc a
magician is always good ill speak a
word and you come in after the show
and well see what you can do it dont
have to be too good you dont stutter
do you  i know youre not too proud 

  nnnnooo i stuttered

co it began and i burlesqued a stage
magician very well my clumsiness
and inexperience the audience thought
was put on and it went off fine but
the queen wasnt fooled

  i was young and being around pul-
chritudinous broadminded females was
seventh heaven i ate regularly and
spent a lot of my time watching doors
for lola watching her on the stage
getting a chance to talk to her in the
wings

  pretty soon i was that way about
lola and everybody knew it including
her she had a big heart and never
put me in the place i probably be-
longed so far as she was concerned
thats what i thought before i learned
she cared

  everything was jake my act was
funny if not clever and lola advised
me as to how to better it if i had left
well enough alone id still be a trouper
instead of telling this sad story and
it is sad

  but i got a bright idea i devised
an improvement on the gazeeka box
and i called it the fountain of

youth

  the gazeeka box is an old standby
of burlesque it has a trick bottom it
looks like a coffin you put someone

inside then you close the door say
presto open the door and there either
is nobody there or there is someone
else there which is surprising enough
but everyone has seen it and no one
is surprised which i decided to
remedy

  i rigged a trick fountain of chemical
mist there were mirrors and such
things and when somebody stepped in-
to the fountain they disappeared or
they could appear out of nowhere right
in the fountain and it was very pretty

  the way i worked it an old lady
walked into the fountain and disap-
peared after a second out stepped
the pretties of our chorus girls in sheer
net did a little dance of naked joy and
pranced erf the stage the fountain of
youth-and we had a swell bally-hoo
which made it all very impressive

  frank says lola first time we
worked the new act-it needs some-
thing after the girl comes out put
somebody else in and have a monster
come out-something goes wrong see
thats funny queen the magi-
cian i used to work for had an old book
that mentioned a spell that was sup-
posed to do just that-you put in some-
thing and a kind of little monster ap-
peared i copied the spell out of the
book meaning to try it some time-just
for fun you know

  you dont seriously believe in such
things do you

  i dont but there was something
funny about that old book black
harry the magician never let me read
it he had a couple of books he never
let anyone see why what could a
book do wrong

  lots of people have books they are
ashamed of whats funny about that
because i hooked this one and i
remember that spell because i copied
it out of the book before i put it back
that book was plenty peculiar 
mirrors of the queen



  never mind such nonsense frank
just work up the act like i tell you if
its good enough we might get a chance
at big time-ill help you put it over
tonight

  if i had only let it go at that but
i wasnt even listening to her i was
thinking of some of the stunts black
harry used to do that even i couldnt
figure out i was thinking of that
book-so old it didnt even have a cover
or flyleaf so old in black letters on
thin parchment paper-and on the top
of each page-the legend genuine
magic

hphat night i looked up the pages
i had copied out of the ancient
book i copied down again the words
that had caused my curiosity

  in the tyme of artour king there
was an elf queen called the golden
olden magick had she and this spelle
of potencie is hers she tooken five
mirrors and put them in the pentacle
she did so put them that the morwen-
ings light tangled a web of planings
litten thrice from each to one and back
within the magick star of light she did
cause to appear by cunning turning
of mirror facen a black hole out of
night itself

  in that awful hole it was her evil
custom to cast her enemies from that
hole she gotten gold and silver and
gems and outen that hole came mon-
strous little men to serve her

  those she threw in came back no
more yet outen that hole she tooken
much all her fancy did demand for
the wights beyond did serve her

  this awful spelle she did give to
one magickon himsel written it down
thus and to another and at last to me
herein i do print it thaumaturgists
know such things may not go losten
here it is

  five by five and three yards distan

each reflecting over each and under
each down each middle the flaren
slicen so slicen each the other trained
and turned till-the dread black star
appears between

  then beware and bid goodbye what
goes in thare

  i got two more mirrors out of the
stock room and set them up behind the
screen with the other three to form
each one side of a star-the pentacle
the other sides i did not even draw
upon the floor letting the reflected light
do that why why does anybody do
anything because i was interested in
that old book and its deadly serious
attitude toward magic-one couldnt
read it and think it was all foolishness
yet in truth i did not think i was
doing anything but making a wider
opening for the disappearance of the
woman from the chemical mist of the
fountain i turned on the spot for
the light flare slicen and turned each
of the mirrors till the main light made
a line of repetition down the center of
each then i stood back to see just
what i had at first it didnt appear
to be anything but as i moved about
my shoulder nudged one of the mirrors
and instantly in the center of the mirror
arrangement appeared a wide black
space a place where no light entered-
a shadow deep and sinister it looked
too

  i was startled but still didnt realize
that there was anything remarkable
about a mere shadow caused by reflec-
tion of a light

  i didnt realize that mirrors by a
concentration of many lines of force
could so distort or work upon the tenu-
ous webs of space itself as to cause to
project into three dimensions something
that was distinctly not of our three
dimensions but of a higher or a lower
number to me it was a peculiar illu-
sion similar to many such tricks em-


fantastic adventures

ployed by magicians and the ancient
authority for its potent nature i took
most lightly of all or did i who
knows truly what goes on in the hid-
den portions of his own mind

  i passed off the black space as a
mere coincidence of shadow lines from
the mirrors switched off the spot and
left for a dinner date with lola i for-
got all about it till the show opened
that night we didnt need to rehearse
even a new act we ad libbed whenever
we didnt know what came next and
the audience at a burlesque show is
never critical

i stood that night in front of a
half-filled house for the first show
a vague dread of that waiting black
web of darkness stretched between the
five mirrors began to bother me could
it be that simple three dimensional
space could be converted by simple re-
peated light force dynamically reflect-
ing over and over-distorted into a
weird path between adjacent worlds of
space-time i brushed away the silly
fears and went into my spiel while out
of the wings shuffled old mary the
derelict we had hired to play the part
of the aged creature converted by the
fountain of youth into a young
chorus girl

  behind the shimmering mist of chem-
icals spraying upward i could see that
black star-shaped web of light force
spread like a great spider five feet tall
and five-armed big in the center as a
mans body

  old mary inobedience to my mo-
tions and my words-presto age be-
comes youth abra and cadabra and
oom himself will take away this
shriveling mask and give you once
again the glory of youth enter the
fountain-advanced to the center of
the mist i pressed the foot button that
caused the mist to shoot higher its con-

cealing screen of coiling mist white
and thick and eery

  now while the audience could not
see beyond the mist i could and mary
ducked backward into the center of the
mirror arrangement expecting to feel
trixie benson the smooth little num-
ber who played the part of the re-
juvenated mary brush by as she
stepped into the center of the mist

  it was as pretty an act as there was
on any burlesque stage which are not
usually noted for complex or artistic
work and i waited impatiently not
wanting trixie to spoil the effect by
coming on late as she had before but
my eyes were telling me that both of
them were there in that black star of
shadow behind the fountain for neither
of them had left i should have seen
marys back retreating behind the cur-
tain to the wings and should have seen
trixies young curves within the mist
but neither of them had come through
that black star on either side

  i waved my hands and let up on the
hidden foot pedal of the mist spray
hoping trixie had gotten in place in
the center-but no trixie i stepped on
it again and the white coils shot up
high as i intoned-obdoolah geni-
urkim eeniequey oodey omesing-
say

  meaning queenie do something
for petes sake she was the only one
watching the act from the wings there
wasnt anyone else to appeal to no-
one else give a darn

  how did i know a fool like me would
stumble onto genuine ancient magic
i still didnt believe anything was
wrong except that trixie wasnt in her
place which was not unusual

  queenie came striding out her long
lovely legs making poetry beneath a
white wooly coat she always put on
when she came off after a dance i let
up on the mist the fountain died down
mirrors of the queen



to a foot high looked at it-exclaimed
in stage surprise the old lady has
disappeared 

  queenie took me up looking into the
mist and screaming-shes gone
youve gone and done it you bumbling
magician bring her back here
queenie was acting for the audience
but i wasnt so sure i was acting

  which was all very well but while
the queen and i peered and acted sur-
prised and waited for trixie to show
behind the mirrors a little man walked
calmly out from the black web of
shadows

  the queen screamed and nearly
fainted in my arms the audience
howled with laughter i just stared at
the little gremlin it wasnt that he
was so small it was the angular dark
gloomy naked body of him like an
african carving of a savage god the
malevolent stare of the deep set eyes
 he turned around and went back
into the web between the mirrors

the audience began to clap it must
have been effective all right but
wasted on that audience so far as sav-
vying what stage craft it must take to
do a thing as real as that

  my knees were knocking together i
stood there nonplussed or fear-stricken
but the queen thought i was having
stagefright i guess for she took over

  now dont worry frank ill get
the little man back and ask him where
is the little old lady

  before i could stop her she stepped
into that fountain and i had auto-
matically stepped on the lever to make
the mist rise and hide her disappear-
ance i took my foot off but just in
time to see her half way through the
wall of black nothing that edged the
star of shadow behind the mist-foun-
tain half in and half out-and cut off
as clean as a knife-and the next in-

stant she was gone

  through my head rang the antique
words of the rhyme from the book

  them she throwed in came outen
neer

  for bid good-bye what goes in
thare

  before i could do anything but press
my two fists to my temples trying to
think-two more of the little men
walked out of the shadow and glared
at me they were not anything a man
could look at and fully grasp small
and strangely angled bodies like alien
carvings or surrealist paintings they
struck a sensing of vast alien dimen-
sions into me that even the departure
of the queens lovely self had not done

  sandra uvald lolas best friend and
herself a talented stripper and fine
looking woman came running out on
the stage the uproar was deafening
with a third of the audience on their
feet shouting incoherently

  i couldnt hear what sandra said but
i could guess i bent my head to her
lips she shouted whats going on
anyway wheres trixie she went
behind the mirrors and never came out
on this side or the other

  i bellowed thats nothing did
you see the gremlins that came out

  sandra looked at me as if i was
crazy i decided maybe she was right
the audience shouted and clapped and
whistled and stomped sandra had on
only a gaudy red dressing gown thrown
over her rhinestone g-string and net
halter

  take it off sandra take it off
the boys shouted whistling happily
unaware entirely of what was going on

  sandie looked at the noisy crowd
that had been filling up steadily since
the show began she smiled and held
up her hand a dead silence fell be-
cause the regulars there practically
worshipped sandra and lola the queen


fantastic adventures

that clear sugary voice of hers rang
eerily to me but i suppose it sounded
fine to everyone else

  friends a strange thing has hap-
pened this magician has caused three
people to disappear vanish-pouf
and he cant tell where they are or
get them back

  they all started laughing for they
thought naturally she was kidding
she went right on above the laughter
little sandra is going into the foun-
tain of youth to see what happened
to the help hold my coat frank
she tossed the vivid red gown satin
thing that made me think of blood into
my arms and the audience howled as
she turned once with her arms raised
glorious smooth flesh perfectly molded
-and stepped alive vital-into that
thing that i called the fountain of
youth and now realized must be only
a door to death

t tried to stop her my mind giv-
ing me shudders of self recrimina-
tion-if only i had told them all what
i was doing if only i hadnt kept it to
myself

  sandra was only trying to help me
out of a situation she saw was going
to reflect badly on me perhaps lose
me the new job i was so proud to have
made good in she didnt realize at all
what she was stepping into   

  the audience bellowed at my acting
as i tried to stop her

  graceful as a goddess she eluded
me sliding past my outstretched hands
with a dancing step-slid into the mist
as easily as a wraith i was sure she
was going to be one the last i saw
of her was one glorious nude leg and
rhinestone glittering strip around her
dimpled hip-and the rest of her sliced
off by the black stars edges and it
wasnt any mirror effect the mirrors
were behind that black reaching place

between it was the focus of the light
planes where they formed a multi-sided
figure in space a star shaped poly-
hedron of force line and plane of light
re-enforced by reflection and re-reflec-
tion until they formed the insupportable
strain on the matrix of our own space-
time that caused that other world ad-
jacent to touch in reality of solid sub-
stantial simultaneity was it synchro-
nized vibrance caused by the repeated
light impact was it space-tortion set
up by the light flows repetition was
it truly ancient magic i was witness-
ing-something no man can under-
stand but only guess at

  i was yelling to the vanished san-
dra-no no thats the fourth di-
mension you cant go in there

  the audience was laughing fit to kill
and i stopped feeling just as ludicrous
and impotent as they thought i was
acting

  there was only one thing to do my
heart contracted as if frozen my skin
broke out in cold sweat and i stripped
off my coat as if about to plunge into
water something inside me seemed to
be shrilling to me-you fool dabbling
in magic has cost you the finest woman
you will ever know you might as well
jump in too you wont enjoy life now

  i took my tottering courage in my
hands and stumbled after lola and
sandra through the mist into the utter
blackness of that star-shaped space be-
tween the five facing mirrors what
else could a man do who knew that
lolas heart was just as big as her sweet
smile made you think it was

  strange vibrating energy shook my
body my eyes saw whirling planes of
light vast sweeps of peculiar mixtures
of light planes endlessly reflecting and
my feet sank softly into some strange
stuff that was not matter as we know
it i stumbled over a body and lay
there for a long time unconscious
mirrors of the queen



then i came to my vision cleared i
got up and staggered on through the
mists until a wind blew it all away and
i saw-a gremlin city

  those angular little hobgoblins com-
ing and going their endlessly piled im-
possible houses of faceted ugly illogi-
cally assembled humps and rounds and
angles of smeary brown plaster con-
struction

  the far mountains reached toward a
sky that was not azure but black a
sky that was only one vast hole in
space and here and there hung dizzily
spinning pinwheels of fire not stars
nebulae i guess-but close and big and
spinning with visible motion

  i took a step and shouted with sud-
den fear for i was sailing end over
end through the sticky ill-smelling air
as i floated slowly down i saw awaiting
me a net in the hands of a dozen angu-
lar ugly little men their malevolent
eyes waiting for me with every possible
evil glee expressed in them or so it
seemed to me then

they carted me off easily though
it took all of them to do it-and
dumped me through the door of one of
the peculiar houses which i only
guessed were houses because there was
nothing that looked more like a house
in evidence

  as i struggled out of the net beside
me i heard lola saying so youre
here at last now would you please
explain just what this is all about before
i go crazy

  i looked up at her beautiful and dis-
traught face she never looked better
to me i sighed and murmured you
wont like it if i do lola

  youd better i can kick your teeth
in before you get out of that net youd
better do some explaining   

  it all began with that old book that
old black harry told me not to read

thats what did it did anybody ever
tell you not to read a book

  i see now you wish you hadnt

go on

  well there were lots of ancient
things in the book stuff nobody can
understand now-a-days but that mag-
ical experiment it described was a
method of creating with light reflections
a doorway into what it called night
it must be a higher-dimension i re-
arranged the mirrors behind the foun-
tain of youth so that they were like the
diagram in the book and here we
are i concluded unwrapping the last
of the net from about my ankles

  that explains a lot to you but it
doesnt help me not a little bit what
are we going to do about it did it
ever occur to your infantile mind that
you were monkeying with first class
danger of a higher order of dynamite
did that bird brain of yours never
think of the consequences

  well you see queen i didnt ex-
pect it to work i was going to test it
with some inanimate object first but
it took me so long there wasnt time
before the show and the old lady
came out and walked in before i could
even think of stopping her besides i
was curious besides i didnt believe
in it

  yes yes but what are we going
to do that show is going to turn into
a riot if we dont get back

  lola began to pace up and down the
long narrow peculiarly angled room
like a panther in a trap i sat down
my whole mind engaged-but not with
the problem of the fourth dimension
oh no the light effects upon the sub-
tle nude planes of lolas perfect body
fully revealed in that entirely brief cos-
tume of rhinestones and net and
queenly satiny skin thats what i was
thinking about time ticked by lola
paced now and then striking her hands


fantastic adventures

together or pressing her palms against
her temples as if her head would burst
i could feel the mental conflict she was
going through but strangely i wasnt
built that way i felt myself somehow
like a sailor marooned on a tropical
island with a beautiful girl-wonder-
ful i was alone at last with-the
queen

  suddenly that three-cornered impos-
sible door slid open noiselessly and an-
other net full of thrashing human
plumped in upon the rough brown
greasily shining floor from the blue
suited figure inside came loud snorts
and at last loud curses-dad blamed
the ding-danged crazy world what in
the name of impossible god is going on
anyway judas priest and all the little
priest   

  lola and i stood side by side watch-
ing the contortions inside the net sud-
denly the folds unfolded and out thrust
the sweating face of   a cop a
cop

  dan lola knew him she knew
everybody dan daniels how did
you get here

  im asking you queenie how did
i get here your pal finkelstein the
manager rushes out to me where im
standing perfectly at peace with the
world and tells me four people disap-
peared in the fountain of youth
well i knew what the fountain of
youth was and i figured you and
frankie had thought up a royal ribbing
for the house and all concerned   
a new stunt of some kind i rushes
on wanting to do my part for you
queen like any man would that was
a man and here i am now magician
suppose you do a little talking or
do i wrap this little used night-stick
around your head until you do im
not a man can be made a fool of not
when im conscious and i aint drunk
frankie the magic-man i aint drunk
so give with some information

t told him the truth just as i had
the queen and dan the cop sat
there with the net draped like a sarong
around his hips and his uniform and
looked at me

  if i wasnt here in nowhere land
id run you in as a dangerous psyco-
pathic as it is i guess well let it pass
but mind you i dont believe it im
just biding my time

  dan daniels completed his unwrap-
ping and then like me gave himself
up to serious contemplation-not of the
peculiar things that might be seen
through the window over our heads not
to speculation as to the wonderful
things that might befall us here in no-
where-but to the subtle undulations
of queenies near-nude body as she re-
sumed her nervous pacing up and down
even in the fourth dimension i mur-
mured

  even what asked queenie

  even in the fourth dimension man
is man and beauty rules him i con-
cluded and the queen snorted she
was too used to being stared at to notice
two mere malese who could not take
their eyes off her

  what became of trixie and san-
dra yes and the old lady asked
lola

  yeah there was supposed to be
four or five of you and theres only
two 

  twos enough i ejaculated re-
fusing to consider any further com-
plexities of life i had finally torn my
eyes away from queenies strip-tease
undress and began to clamber up the
rough wall toward the window over our
heads i looked down and a dizzy
nauseating sensation swept over me i
let go and floated down to the floor i
sat down holding my head

  now whats the matter cant you
stand the sight of the little people
asked dan
mirrors of the queen


fantastic adventures

  look for yourself i groaned

  dan clambered easily up the rough
surface which seemed to lean outward
at a seventy degree angle with the hori-
zontal

  geez frankie what do you call it
i never seen nothing like itl am i
looking straight down or straight up or

what

  i dont know dan but dont fall
out youd never stop  

  i didnt finish from outside some-
where began to come a fiendish cater-
wauling the piping of unearthly flutes
and horns the steady rhythmic beat of
myriad feet

  the door flew open and the noise
thrust into the weird shaped chamber
like an unwelcome and drunken guest
lola peered out i peered out bending
to look under queenies bare smooth
and heavenly arm dan peered out
and cursed

  along the astounding causeway
which hung along the far weird city
like an ugly snake caught by spider-
webs came a procession

  all the little ugly men dressed now
in glittering paraphernalia and orna-
ments ornaments that somehow in
spite of the attempt at decoration yet
looked like many crushed and bright
tin cans strung on strings and wound
about their angular bumpy bodies-
were marching in procession at the
head of the procession danced three
weirdly decorated and painted grem-
lins rattling great square drums full
of pebbles i guess masks on their
faces made far worse than nature had
intended grimacing mouths from ear
to ear horns and tails of flopping
brown greasy feathers-everything
here seemed to be brown and dirty
with grease-or was it the strange
light from the blazing whirling too-
close unborn stars glowing spinning
clouds overhead-that made every-

thing appear so filthy

  straight up to our door came the
processions head and the three danc-
ing homunculi came straight in upon
us began to motion us out the door
with motions of the big square rattles
as if we were fowl or cows to be
driven by fright at the sounds of the
rattles

t got the idea walked out the door
stood waiting for the other two
they lined up beside me and the pro-
cession followed us as we shuffled
awkwardly along trying to keep our
balance and our dignity where every
unwary step sent us four feet into the
air

  that causeway twisted and slanted
this way and that seeming to follow
the tug of an unearthly gravity for we
remained upright even when it seemed
the landscape itself was vertical i
knew no man could know the planes or
differences of this world or know that
these creatures so like ourselves in
some ways and so unlike in others-
could not be four-dimensional crea-
tures it had come to me now that we
were not really in the fourth dimen-
sion but that the light-cube door i had
created had merely made two adjacent
worlds touching in the folds of the
fourth dimension be simultaneous in-
stead of only adjacent had somehow
created a path between two worlds or-
dinarily separated by the un-under-
standable vagaries of irregular fourth
dimension form that the negligible
force of the reflecting rays of light yet
had power to create such a path was
impossible but true perhaps it was
like a match small in itself yet the
flame from one match can burn down
a whole city-or a forest the vibra-
tions of constantly rebounding light
reflecting itself over and over in a
repetitive re-enforcing of some ancient
mirrors of the queen



pattern of known mystic potency-of
awful wisdom from the past which
knew the innermost secrets of space
and time and matter-somehow did
build up such a strain on the ordinary
fabric of space as to cause about them-
selves an opening a break-through
along fourth dimensional force planes
between adjacent worlds   

  i gave up and let my eyes follow
the serpentine winding of the impos-
sible roadway hung by the spider-web
thin strands of cable from the points of
the houses-queer many-angled struc-
tures which seemed supported them-
selves by some unsubstantial mass of
brown heaving matter that anyone
could see would not support ones
weight a city sitting on mud it was
queer brown hateful appearing stuff
wet and glistening-and the paths from
house to house and to the wide twist-
ing cable-hung road all suspended above
the mud that yet supported those
buildings

  the big central building the palace
of the king i suppose it was to them
was the center of many of these cable-
hung roads like the center of a vast
web in the big triangular doorway we
went an after us came the proces-
sion the rattle-shaking leaders the
gloomily tramping ornamented host
trailing behind their little faces and
long noses and their thin ugly lips
twisted all into a mean expression of
waiting malevolence

  you know said dan if i had
been invited i wouldnt have come i
never felt so unwelcome in my life

  i whispered pretend to like what-
ever happens no matter how hard it is
thats the best advice i can give you
i used to study psychology if you
can seem to be on their side-ok
but if they get the idea we dont like
them-look out 

  keep smiling eh asked the queen

and i nodded

  she put on her best stage teeth-
exposing grimace and kept it there she
knew how on her it looked swell on
me i knew it must look awful but i
kept grinning did it help that
gloomy crew never lifted an eyebrow
or twisted a lip the same unsmiling
gloom and mean unanimous sullen ex-
pression

  i couldnt have felt more alone as
far as they went if i had been marooned
on a desert island

the king was a caricature a gnome
out of a story book a thin long
faced little man with narrow shoulders
pot belly long jeweled fingers drum-
ming on the carved wood of the throne
his crooked shins were bare and a
pair of bangled knickers which reached
nearly to his armpits was his sole cos-
tume aside from armlets aglitter with
gems and an iron collar around his
neck his staff of office was ivory
white and gleaming a polished bone
that looked horribly reminiscent of its
one time place in life as a human thigh-
bone

  he glowered down at us probably
wondering what he was going to say
to people who wouldnt know what he
was talking about i broke the un-
comfortable silence by smiling as en-
gagingly as i could and lola giggled
nicely but her arm against mine felt
as cold as marble

  dan decided not to be left out and
boomed greetings to you just what
do you want with us anyway

  at the feet of the monarch something
stirred and i noticed what their immo-
bility had concealed before-the kings
women i hadnt been sure before be-
cause of their uniform ugliness just
which were male and which female but
now i knew i was gazing upon the
selected beauties of the kings harem


fantastic adventures

stretched about his feet in what may
have been supposed to be a languorous
adoration-and one of them stretched
her face up on a thin boneless neck and
the king leaned forward to hear then
he gave a kind of bark that may have
been a guffaw though you werent able
to tell and the girl-thin angular and
mud brown and completely ugly-
though her face was smooth and not
bumpy her skin clear and smooth on
her bare shoulders and prominent but-
tocks-got up and approached us

  waist high she stood before the
queen who is a good five eleven in her
heels and she always has heels lola
smiled upon her with all the benevo-
lence of a venus and for me with quite
as devastating an effect

  then the girl really surprised me
she began to whisper i learned your
language from the other two the old
one and the young one they came
through the magic fountain long long
ago they said that sometime soon the
magician who had sent them would
come for them i believed them but
you never came i learned the language
so that i could go back with you will
you take me

  if i had been unconscious with sur-
prise before now i really was stunned
i said you learned the language from
two who came through long ago but
nobody came through long ago  it
was only minutes ago

  you are demon frank magician
arent you

  her pronunciation was poor but
plain enough    weakly i nodded my
head i guess

  then your friends came here years
ago we have awaited your coming
with great interest now you will take
me back with you

  its all right with me just show
me the place we came in

  i will do that but not now soon

  she turned away held up her thin
ugly hand began to harangue the for-
mal line-up of the gremlins with a
series of word-sounds that no recording
machine could have held in a groove
after minutes of this we were led to a
place before the throne and squatted
down in a line with several gremlin
dignitaries squatting on each side

jy kind of pageant or dance was
performed through which we sat
the procession which had led us to the
palace wound and jumped shook their
rattles nodded their heads shuffled
their feet in and out and round and
round until i was dizzy and nauseated
not alone with the motion but with the
peculiar muddy smell of sweat and wet
evil air

  queenie whispered what is she
talking about the two who came before
years ago

  everything is crazy here lola
time as well as space is different here
while we monkeyed around on the stage
for a minute or two before following
she through the fountain time itself
was rushing along here in the next
adjacent world with no connection with
our own time rate at all seconds there
seem to be months here   

  then how did dan arrive within
such a short time

  doesnt mean a thing when i came
through the shock was so great i
passed out i may have lain uncon-
scious for what was years here but
only a few minutes back in our world-
lain or stood or fell-for long minutes
-years here still on the borderline be-
tween the worlds then i came through
slid or fell into this world

  i stopped too the strange lights and
electric shock the waves of energy
beating at me    i stopped for a long
pause afraid to go on   

  exactly and years passed here
mirrors of the queen



while we were pausing between the
worlds dan rushed right on through
rescue bent   

  yeah thats right i did but how
did you know dan had begun to
listen in

  thats what were talking about
the funny looking skinny friend the
kings girl friend said the other two
came through long years ago we were
just figuring out where we were all that
time

 years what are you talking
about

  never mind ill explain it all when
we get back i didnt want to miss a
trick here in this court too much de-
pended on understanding this place and
these fiend-faced small ungainly people
to stop to argue about the relative mo-
tions of separate time-flows with a cop

  the redundant circling of the grem-
lin court led to a climax-a thunderous
booming of drums-shaking of rattles
and shrill screams a rhythmic repeat-
ing chant lending a background to it
all at the peak of the furious dance
the dancers began one by one to strip
off their ornaments and cast them at
the queens fair feet

  i looked at queenie the pile of glit-
tering gew-gaws grew and grew as
each dancer took off the bangles and
tossed them on the heap he backed
away from the queen with his head
bent low finishing by falling to his
knees far- enough away to let the others
pass and make their contribution soon
we were surrounded by these kneeling
suppliants and protected by a barrier
of ornaments

  i picked up one of the heavy strings
of bangles objects the size of a baseball
and surprisingly hefty considering the
gravity reduction here the thing was
either alloyed silver or gold it was too
bright-colored for lead set in the metal
were semi-polished gems big as mar-

bles i looked at queenie

  i dont know what these guys mean
by this lola but if im right you have
several million dollars worth of raw
gold and crude jewels there in front of
you just what are they throwing the
stuff at you for

even as i asked the words of the old
rhyme rang in my head echoing down
from an antiquity i could only guess at
there was an elf queen called the
golden

  in that hole it was her custom

  to cast her enemies and her victims
  and to get back gold and silver and
  gems-

  for monstrous little men came out
    to serve her

an idea came to me and i beck-
oned to the thin brown girl who
had gone back to the feet of her king
she rose and walked toward me her
head bobbing toward the queen

  why do they give these to the
queen i asked her pointing to the
pile of precious hardware

  she is the answer to an ancient
prophecy among us from the land of
the immortals the golden one will
come again she is the golden queen
of the legend whom the dryne used to
serve in the other world to them she
is an immortal

  the girls answer was clear enough
they took lola murphy for the same
elf queen who had long ago used the
mirrors to make a place to throw peo-
ple she didnt like the time was so
different between the worlds that a per-
son on earth probably lived a hundred
of the lifetimes here in this crazy mixed
up geography so they would seem
immortal it would be called the world
of the immortals and these weird little
people were called the dryne i was
learning

  what were the customs of this leg-


fantastic adventures

endary queen what did she do here
how did she go back i asked the
girl nervously hoping for some clew
to a course of action which would place
us on top

  much is forgotten it has been so
long only do we know that in the days
of our forefathers the golden queen
came through and held festival for
days-then went back to her world
that is all anyone could tell you

  i turned to lola there it is queen
you dance for them talk to them get
them to join in and loosen up get them
good natured-and back we go with a
load of jewels

  it might be a good idea to sell them
a little flesh worship at that it might
be worth a life or two lola smiled
at me not that i care about anyone
here   

  lola stood up raised her lovely arms
letting the brief wooly coat slide off to
the pave here contrasted with the
drynes skinny outrageously ugly
bodies the smooth glorious rounds and
muscled planes of her perfect figure
stood out in a beauty unperceived even
by me before she was a goddess here
and to these people an immortal she
said several words not meaning to be
understood but as an opening for the
dance she began it was one of those
slow creepy dances where the dancer
seems to invoke some unseen presence
-i could tell that lola had chosen it
to give the impression of contact with
the world we had just left behind pos-
turing slowly moving her limbs and
bending back the perfection of her
columnar torso to reveal all the mus-
cled ivory beauty she built up there
in that impossible horrible court a
vision of the worship of unseen beauty
-even while she built up by the lan-
guage of gestures the impulse to wor-
ship beauty among the dryne her
beauty she spoke of it with every

trick known to dancers with every bur-
lesque bump and sensual shiver mingled
with a knowledge of true dramatic
dancing and the dryne watched with
their gloomy wide-gashed mouths open
and drooling their beady eyes aglitter
with desire as she climaxed the dance
with a spread arm gesture they fell to
their knees in unison as at a command
-and i whispered to the dryne girl
still waiting beside our group

  announce her as the golden queen
of old time come again to her friends
the dryne to bring wisdom and pleas-
ure to them to open again the pathway
between the worlds so that both we
and they might profit make it good
and i will get you what you want-a
trip back with us

tn the silence the girl began to
chant in the squeaky raspy lan-
guage of the dryne a monotonous
repetition of several phrases over and
over what she said i dont know-
but for the first time the gloomy faces
lit up with a half-hearted smile and the
heads nodded agreement right and left

  now tell them we must go back to
arrange for their wishes to be granted
and that we will return to them with
gifts to startle them with our gratitude
for these gifts they have made our
queen

  the thin little brown girl spoke
again and i wondered at the response
the furious shaking of heads in the
negative the discussion that soon rose
in a high ear-splitting gabble every-
where they did not want lola to leave
-not ever

  the king who had watched the
dance with particularly greedy eyes
now stood up and held up his hands to
quiet them he began to talk furiously
and at length

  when he was through the brown girl
translated to me
mirrors of the queen



  this stranger woman must not rule
us again as she did in the old time we
rule ourselves and no one or nothing
can say to us go and come i leave or
i stay she shall be my woman and
slave here with my other wives like
any common woman we will not let
these people go hut kill them in the
sacrifice as we have always done we
have waited too long let the death
rites begin

  even as the girl finished her trans-
lation the three bangled priests and
several others had sprung forward pro-
ducing nets from about their wrists
others were running toward us with
larger nets we were about to be made
helpless again i looked about in des-
peration my wits racing seeking an
opening in circumstance at dans belt
hung his police revolver

  dan theres only one thing a mir-
acle youve got to shoot the king or
were done for quick man the king
   with him dead lola will be the
queen again 

  dan not understanding still saw the
nets in the air over our heads falling
slowly as did everything here

  he tugged out the gun sighting with
what seemed to me ridiculous care and
much too long he blasted at the king
once twice the king stood there
looking at us in a terrified surprise
stood-and suddenly the blood ran out
of his mouth he pitched forward on
his face rolled grotesquely down the
steps of the dais

  get on that throne queen i bel-
lowed get up there and act like a
queen or else youll be darn sorry
gracefully eluding the nets now al-
most upon us lola strode to the throne
mounting the dais without more than
a scornful glance at the dead body she
knew what i meant had not missed a
single nuance of meaning about her
standing there proud and triumphant

and regal she raised her hands for
silence and spoke

  my people your king did not under-
stand the benevolence i mean toward
you he caused his death by defying
my magic now remember hereafter
who is the queen and your ruler or you
too will have to die as he has

  after her glorious ringing tones the
dull grey monotone of the translator
rose shrilly explaining what she had
said as she finished the queen ges-
tured to the girl and as she approached
placed her arm about her in affection

  thank you very much little one
what is your name

  my name is normea o queen
then announce that hereafter you
are the second in importance here and
your words are my words until you
cause my displeasure i am grateful
to you

	 

 ihat was the most astounded audi-
ence that ever sat in the worn
seats of a burlesque theatre-when we
came through although we had been
in that screwball world for what seemed
at least a weeks time and sandra
who had never reached there at all
swore she had been suspended in a grey
colud for years while trixie and the
old woman mary swore they had lived
for years in the quarters of the kings
women-here on the stage of the troc
it was only some twenty minutes later
there was just no correlating time and
the fourth dimension so far as i could
see-if it was the fourth

  two comedians had rushed out after
my disappearance in the fountain and
began a furious distraction to cover the
disastrous mystery of the mirrors be-
hind the fountain

  they were still at it chasing each
other trying to take the clothes off a
chorus girl slapping each other around


fantastic adventures

and getting off their whole bag of gags
while feinstein and the cops who had
come to answer his insistent phoning
searched the back stage and dressing
rooms all to no avail

  we stepped out of the fountain right
between the two comedians and the
big fat one fainted dead away

  no wonder for each of us was carry-
ing an arm load of wired together
trinkets and each of us was followed
by a little gremlin also loaded down
with jewelry

  i dumped my load of glittering junk
in the center of the stage and sandra
and lola took up positions on each
side dan stood in line with them and
mary and trixie did not stop but ran
right off the stage crying and sobbing
with frantic relief

  i started spieling why i dont know
-but someone had to explain the weird
appearance of the dozen little men who
had followed us through had to ex-
plain the little knob heads that peeked
out of the fountain and shyly ducked
back only to be replaced by another

  we have just been on a trip to the
place where all magicians send the
people they cause to disappear and we
brought back these gremlins to prove
what has been concealed from the de-
luded public so long that magic is
caused by gremlins alone here they
are and here are the gifts they gave us
on our visit if any of you gentlemen
would like to vist the world of the
gremlins just step right up  

  the audience began to clap to them
it was a superb act something so far
above what they expected that they
could not express their admiration but
there were no takers on the offer to
go through the fountain-and i could
understand why some of those people
must have realized they had witnessed
something so out of the ordinary as to
be utterly unbelievable to ordinary

man

  i shook hands with each of the grem-
lins who had carried our gifts and lola
placed her hand on each bbny ugly
shoulder in turn and smiled her good-
by they stepped back through the
fountain all but one small shy brown
maid and she had ran off the stage
after mary and trixie unable to bear
the scrutiny of the battery of strange
eyes

  as quickly as the last little man had
disappeared i stepped behind the foun-
tain and gave a mirror a nudge with my
shoulder i broke out in a cold sweat
with realization that we would have
been forever cut off if just one blunder-
ing foot had stumbled against just one
of those mystically aligned mirrors

  the big black star of distorted space
disappeared with a faint audible plop
i gave a vast sigh of relief and disre-
garding any further attempt at a show
turned back to the heap of jewelery
someone dropped the curtain in front
of us dragged off the still unconscious
comedian lola turned to me sug-
gesting

  you know frank we promised to
send them back gifts to show our grati-
tude  

  theyre probably all dead of old
age by now weve been here all of five
minutes

  it doesnt seem right frank

  look lola you can open that trap-
door into infinity again if you want to
but as for me im leaving it strictly
alone would you like to marry me
now that were both rich or would you
rather go into society

 what would i do in society
frank

  for a minute it didnt register then
i got it she meant yes impossible
but true

	 

  the only thing that ever bothers
mirrors of the queen



lola and i here in our ranch outside
hollywood is explaining where did
you get such an odd looking servant
shes positively hideous and her eyes
distinctly malevolent i wouldnt trust

her for a minute

  theres one thing about our ranch-
house there isnt a mirror in it odd
isnt it

power through the air

 by carter t wainwright 

in this age of atomic power radar and
rocket ships we have seen the most fantastic
dreams of the science-fictionists come true
nothing any longer seems to be impossible
there are two gadgets however that the world is
waiting for-and undoubtedly they will appear
eventually but right now there seems to have
been little progress except in one of them

  the first device that needs consideration is some
sort of mechanism for the storage of electrical
energy electrical batteries do not store electricity
-they store chemical energy which is changed to
electrical energy there are two simple things
which actually store electrical energy-the con-
denser and the coil the first stores power in
the form of an electric field and the latter stores
power in the form of a magnetic field the
trouble is that neither of these devices stores
enough energy-mere driblets which have no
meaning as far as doing real work is concerned
a fortune awaits the person who can invent some
practical way of storing huge quantities of elec-
trical energy that may be released under complete
control

  the next problem is the transmission of power
without wires this has been a dream of many
men-nicola tesla among the more notable as
well as some of the best known scientists and
inventors of all time the funny thing is this
the wireless transmission of power actually exists
today-it is radio but everyone knows the
drawback there not enough power is trans-
mitted and what is sent spreads over such a huge
area that it arrives at any one receiver in minute
infinitesimal amounts an ordinary radio re-
ceiver picks up not more than a few millionths of
a watt of electrical power this applies to radar
transmission as well but the latter-radar trans-
mission-supplies us with a clue of sorts to the
practical transmission of energy in radar we are

dealing with beams of radio waves closely focused
so as to concentrate the maximum amount of
energy on the receiving machine by continually
narrowing the beam by using every variety of
parabolic reflector or similar focusing aid it is
possible to get a great deal more energy on the
receiving end

  unfortunately even this isnt the answer radio
and radar beams near the surface of the earth
fall off in intensity inversely as the first power of
the distance so as long as the receiver is very
near the transmitter a fair amount of power can
be received but the minute the transmitter is
moved more than a few yards away from the re-
ceiver there is little energy to be caught

  probably the answer is that some entirely new
approach must be devised a method must differ
radically from the conventional techniques now
employed in an issue of amazing stories of
not long ago a solution was suggested in which
the ground formed one part for a conductor and
radiation was the other it is not likely that this
would prove feasible because it is already being
done that is just about how an ordinary radio
transmitter and receiver work no the answer
lies along entirely different lines

  that the answer will be found of course is with-
out question it is just a matter of time what
is so disheartening is that no new avenues of ap-
proach have even suggested themselves at
present we know as little as we did ten years ago
some way must be found to concentrate radiation
into a tight narrow beam almost like a stiletto
and to hurl this beam at an appropriate receiver
even parabolic reflectors cannot yet do that with
ordinary or high frequency radiation perhaps
the solution lies in some radically new type of
transmitter employing some other apparatus be-
sides an antenna to send forth its power
                  there was a harsh screech of brakes as the laundry truck tried to step but it was

                                     
veryone at the bar looked at
his drink as montrose passed by
he peered eagerly for a recep-
tive face when he reached the end of
the bar montrose knew it was the
brush-off he stopped then uncertain
wondering whether to go back to the
street or try among the tables in the
rear

  callaghan the bartender saw him
standing there cals broad irish face
softened a little he put his hands flat
on the bar and leaned over it

  if its a drink yere wantin
monty he croaked ill give ye wan
-and no more

  montrose managed a wry grin

 i need more than a drink cal
but thanks anyway he caught sight
of jack rann sitting alone at a table
in the corner i-i have to se rann

  whatever ye need he wont give it
to ye callaghans voice was bitter
but low

  montrose squared his broad shoul-
ders and strode to the table in the cor-
ner behind him a juke box blared
above a rumble of conversation but he
didnt hear it

 jack rahn looked up as montrose
stood over him

   lo chum the little mans voice

                                frank montrose needed money
                             badly so he sold his body to be
                             delivered after his death--or so he
                             thought 

loo late frank montrose screamed hoarsely as the fender of the truck struck him 

                                  


fantastic adventures

was flat he did not ask montrose to

sit down

hello jack look i want to talk

to you

  im expecting company chum
itll only take a minute jack lis-
ten

  montrose paused when rann made
no move montrose pulled out a chair
and sat down he stared across the
scarred table-top at the thin face trying
not to hate the evil little man

  jack rann gave him a slow stare that
took in the frayed collar the wrinkled
tie unpressed suit

  yeah i know montroses mouth
twisted i look like a tramp
chum you are a tramp

maybe everybody isnt as lucky
as you jack most people have their
ups and downs right now im down
rann shrugged he sipped slowly at
his drink

  this is what i wanted to see you
about ive got a terrific tip on a
hundred-to-one shot

  ranns laugh grated through the
smoky air two men at the bar turned
their heads sharply toward the noise
then looked quickly back at their
drinks ranns laugh was a rare-and
unpleasant thing

  save your breath monty rann
said this hot tip-you want to bor-
row the dough from me for a bet
yes but this is my chance it
may sound screwy-but ive got a real
hunch i know that horse is going to
win  he gripped the tables edge with
both hands as he leaned forward
lend me a hundred bucks jack and
ill give you half the take five
grand

  scram chum

  montrose leaned forward still in-
wardly he writhed at the sight of the
gloating face before him he hated
himself for asking rann for the money

but he had to he knew the horse
would win and he had to bet on it
its a cinch jack

  rann shook his head slowly tantaliz-
ingly his slate eyes showed a brief
flash of mirth were cold again

  ive done you favors jack a
hundred bucks isnt much

  it is to me thats why ive got a
hundred

a tontrose leaned back in his
chair expelling his pent-up breath
in a deep sigh he stared down at his
hands disgusted at the grime beneath
his nails five thousand dollars would
paw for a lot of manicures

  he peered up at rann

  you dont know where i could get
it

  the little gambler started to shake
his head then stopped he laughed
showing all his teeth

  why monty i think i do that is
if you really want the dough

  he laughed again enjoying the mad
hope in montroses face

  of course i want it

  well then sell your body its
not worth much but youll get a hun-
dred for it

  what

  sell your body i said to a hos-
pital

  you little- montrose pulled him-
self out of his chair sell my body
what kind of malarkey is that
montrose knew then he had had
enough he was still man enough to
step on a rat he drew back his fist

  all right dope rann snapped
im trying to give you a tip ignoring
the threatening fist he took out a cigar-
ette case selected one and lit it any
big hospital will buy your body you
just sign a paper so your bodys theirs
when you die and they give you a
hundred bucks
contract for a body



  he grinned maliciously

  they cut it up of course but what
do you care

  youre not fooling me

  seems to me theres a hospital over
on maple street it wont cost you
anything to find out

sphere was a dim light over the
entrance montrose opened a gate
that clanked a little and walked softly
toward the door it didnt look like a
very big hospital and a heavy silence
seemed to brood over it above him
on the fourth floor a single window
showed light

  why the light montrose wondered
was some poor devil dying or was it
the surgery montrose had a momen-
tary vision of men around a table
cutting cutting he shuddered
he could see his own body stiff in
death but robbed of deaths dignity

  damn it he muttered i cant
do thisl

  montrose stopped

  but within him a voice snickered
whats the difference between that and
the potters field

  there wasnt any of course and
rann was probably lying probably

  montrose ran up the steps and
pushed through the doors

  the hall was dim to the point of
blackness behind the receptionists
curved counter was a switchboard
above this a single lamp was the halls
sole light a man in a white coat sat
at the board dozing over a magazine

  montrose edged up to him the
orderly looked up sleepily

  yes

  i-i 

  montroses throat went suddenly dry
he was overcome with an acute em-
barrassment

  yes are you ill

  oh no not at all not at all

  it occurred to him that his value
might be lessened if they didnt think
him perfectly sound

  no he said again im okay
never been sick a day in my life
the ordely frowned

  well then    

  i-well i want to sell my body
the orderly was wide awake now
he blinked at montrose then sniffed
loudly

  im not drunk montrose exclaim-
ed i just want to sell the hospital my
body to use after im dead to ex-
periment on

  he sighed it was over now in a
few minutes hed have the money but
the orderly was grinning

  gosh i suppose they still do that
once in a while he chuckled theres
no law against it and i suppose a big
public hospital can always use a cada-
ver but not us

  not you

  nope didnt you read the sign
we just handle mental cases were a
private outfit

  i see

  the inescapable odor of hospital
hung on the air the pungent blend of
drugs medicines and sickness it
fogged montroses mind there was
a hazy inner vision of a horse gallop-
ing across the finish line-without even
a dime of montrose money on it and
there was ranns face leering his secret
smile montrose hated rann then
and no matter what later happened
the hatred never completely left him

  still in the fog he didnt hear a door
open down the hall or the sound of
quiet but assured footsteps approach-
ing

  oh good evening dr aloysio the
orderlys voice was respectful i didnt
know you were still here sir

  yes a knotty problem of re-
search


fantastic adventures

 research

 the word snapped montroses con-
 sciousness into the clear he turned
 toward the doctor

 ah yes

 jjrontrose saw a long dark face
 smooth shaven deep-set eyes be-
 hind black-rimmed glasses a fore-
 head that swooped in a pale high dome
 before it met black hair

 well look

 the eyes behind the glasses confused
 him his voice faltered to a stop

 i told you cried the orderly
 dont bother the doctor

 dr aloysios smile was benign

 is there something i can do he
 murmured

 oh no sir   exclaimed the orderly
 this man had the idea that wed buy
 his body i told him we wouldnt and
 referred him to general

 the doctor chuckled deep in his
 throat he beamed at montrose

but the body seems saleable
enough he smiled sturdy and
sound

 dont kid with me choked mont-
 rose im serious

 my dear sir the doctor raised a
 pale hand i too am serious if you
 will just step into my office i will show
 you just how serious i am

 what gaped the orderly

 dr aloysios eyes blazed behind his
 glasses the orderly gulped then sat
 down hastily he tried to pick up his
 magazine and it fell to the floor

 dr aloysio smiled at montrose

 we experiment from time to time
 he murmured you offer your body
 for experiment of course

 sure do what you damn please
 with it after im dead

 by all means after youre dead
 the doctor chuckled again the
 orderly gave him a sidelong look the

man seemed afraid-and amazed at his
fear he stared furtively after them
as the two entered dr aloysios office

  montrose stood in the center of the
room trying to focus on what he saw
more dimness a stand-lamp outlined
easy chairs a wall of books a deep
rich carpet was beneath his feet then
out of the darkest corner a rotund
shape waddled toward him

  my associate murmured dr aloy-
sio dr fesler mr-

  montrose frank montrose

  how do you do sir dr feslers
hand was soft and moist you will
pardon the darkness i cannot stand
light

  his eyes said aloysio he moved
behind montrose over to the vague
bulk of a desk im afraid fesler
well have to have the desk-lamp at
least

  fesler put a hand in front of his eyes
as the light came on montrose saw
that he was wearing dark glasses both
men stared calmly at him aloysio
erect by the desk fesler directly in
front of him after a long pause fes-
ler turned and rolled back to his dark
corner still they said nothing

  montrose tried to laugh his throat
was very dry

  i suppose you think im crazy
his voice was so high it almost broke
but i need money badly ill sell you
my body for-whatever the usual fee
is

  and well buy it wont we fesler

  we surely will feslers voice was
barely audible

  it is a not unusual request said
aloysio i remember when i interned
at general-but thats neither here nor
there

  he bent down opened a drawer and
took out a pad

  please feel no embarrassment mr
montrose this is a definite contribu-
contract for a body

l

tion to science you are really to be
congratulated sir

  oh indeed fesler laughed

t tls soft laugh annoyed montrose

  	and the other one aloysio talked
much oh god if that horse came in
hed never never have to ask anyone
for money again

  dr aloysio wrote on the pad tore
off a sheet and wrote again on another
sheet finally he looked up

  if you will just step this way mr
montrose montrose reached the desk
in two strides you see ive just
written a simple agreement in dupli-
cate you sign them and keep one for
yourself use my pen sir

  montrose bent over the desk he
heard no movement but as he reached
for the pen he could hear fesler breath-
ing beside him

  it seemed simple enough

  i frank montrose of my own free
will do hereby assign to the full posses-
sion of dr izak aloysio my physical
body same to be delivered to him upon
my death in consideration thereof i
have received one hundred dollars
montrose straightened

  sounds like im selling you my body
now he muttered

  fesler started to speak but aloysios
laugh cut him off

  indeed you are sir aloysio nod-
ded as soon as you sign and i pay
you the bodys mine but i dont
think the law would allow me to tamper
with it until you are completely through
with it

  i guess thats right

  montrose began to write his hand
trembled he could see that horse
again ten lengths in the lead and frank
montrose had a hundred dollars riding
the nag at one hundred-to-onel

he straightened both men sighed
deeply dr fesler turned away and

lumbered back to his chair in the
corner dr aloysios eyes followed
him and then montrose was amazed to
hear him snicker aloysio grinned
widely for a moment then his face
smoothed and he turned to montrose
now sir he said for the money
he took out a wallet and extracted
ten new ten-dollar bills he presented
them to montrose with a flourish

  a moderate price mr montrose
i fear i am the gainer by it

  montrose stared at the money in his
hand feverish anticipation had dulled
his capacity for realising now the
money was his but he scarcely felt it
he lifted his head

  i-i-thanks i guess ill be going
  if theres nothing else

  no sir not a thing

  much later as montrose made his
night long hike to the track he won-
dered vaguely why they hadnt attempt-
ed to get more information they
didnt know who he was where he lived
nothing what guarantee had they
that they could collect when-when the
time came

urn off that light growled dr
fesler

  dr aloysio grinned

  you were always a fool brother
not the least bit of imagination why
pick a body-when bodies must have
darkness-

  turn off that light bellowed fes-
ler

  all right all right the study
was in darkness as i was saying
continued aloysios smooth voice 
am an artist i was dr aloysio per-
fect and complete not something that
couldnt stand light

  he stared at dr fesler

  even now he said there is still
something shapeless about you

  thats because im leaving im


fantastic adventures

sick of your babble

  aloysios laugh was not pleasant to
hear

  youre angry youre beginning to
see the possibilities oj our wager and
you know that im going to win yes
im going to win

  he sat quiet in the dark

trank montrose turned from the
rail by the finish line and started
toward the tunnel that led to the mutuel
windows this time there was no
thronging crowd of winners surging
down the tunnel very few people pick
a hundred-to-one shot as he walked
along he realized he had known all
along that the horse would win

 why

  hed made so many wrong guesses
the past year but this had been no
guess i this time he had been certain

  the mutuel clerk relaxed his habitual
impassivity as he counted out ten
thousand dollars

  youre the top winner today pal
he said

  did i have the only ticket on the
nag asked montrose

  well i had one laughed a voice
behind him

  montrose took the money from the
clerk and turned around he hadnt
seen much of her type lately tall-
healthy-beautiful in a sharp clean
way grey eyes met his in a level
direct stare he found himself meeting
her smile

  were smart he chuckled

  werent we

  the clerk gave her two hundred
dollars montrose stood watching her
frank delight as she scooped the money
into her purse

  he laughed aloud

  the girl gave him a questioning
glance

  im standing here with ten thousand

dollars he explained and i havent
a cigarette to my name

  here have one of mine im not
as rich as you but i do have cigar-
ettes

  they moved aside to make room for
the bettors on the last race montrose
felt through his pockets he didnt
even have a match

  that was my last hundred he con-
fessed i didnt have cigarette money
a gateman pal of mine let me in the
track

  there was nothing rude in the way
she looked at him his grey eyes
looked briefly at his clothes then long
and searchingly at his face

  you were very brave-or very des-
perate her voice was puzzled
just desperate he grinned

  she was nice to look at the powder
blue suit fitted her trim figure perfectly
her brown hair with a natural wave
curved softly about her face mont-
rose smiled to himself why not push
his luck a little farther

  look he said why dont you help
me celebrate have dinner with me
she frowned a little

  its unconventional i know he
was very suave but im playing a
hunch again well have a good time
i feel it

  we-ell- your hunches seem good
ones mr 

  montrose frank montrose

  im marcia powers

  marcia powers held out her hand
her clasp was firm and warm

  much later they sat in a quiet little
place that montrose had known long
before so long that the headwaiter
had forgotten him but on the strength
of marcias looks and montroses new
suit he remembered they drank a
long drink and talked quietly

 fter a while marcia sat silent
    staring at the table-cloth
contract for a body



  im rich smiled montrose ill
offer two pennies for your thoughts
she raised her head slowly

  this has been a curious day the
first time i ever went to a horse race
and-the first time i ever went out with

a stranger

  if im still a stranger then it isnt
my lucky day after all

  frank marcias voice was serious
may i ask you a question

    go ahead

  what have you done with that ten
thousand dollars

  montrose was amazed to find that he
didnt consider the question imperti-
nent

  i left about eight thousand in the
safe at my hotel i bought some
clothes spent a little tonight ive got
about fifteen hundred on me

  her eyes widened

  do you honestly expect to spend
fifteen hundred dollars tonight
montrose looked off toward the
orchestra he had forgotten his plans
for this evening certainly he had
planned to get this girl home early
then over to callahans and get that
bastard rann in a crap game yes
hed promised himself a lot of things
for that night-and hed done just a
few of them

  i dont know he said at last i
always carried-carry a lot of money
on me

  marcia reached across the table and
covered his hand with hers surprised
he turned to face her

  youve been awfully broke havent
you as he started to protest she
shook her head no frank you
looked awfully seedy at the track i
dont know really why i went out with
you somehow i liked you i still
do very much

  he could not cope with her honesty
he couldnt tell this girl what he

wanted to do or did he still want to
do those things looking down at
her hand feeling her fingers over his
montrose decided that he did not

  frank marcia went on i dont
live in this city im a small-town girl
from upstate im such a hick ive
never seen a horse-race before today
i made that bet by sticking a hairpin
through the program

  thats the best system he mur-
mured

  she smiled briefly then her face was
serious again

  but im very happy where i live
frank why dont you take your
money and come up there you would
be happy i think you could do
things

  and why not who was jack rann
-the guy whod stack a deck against
his own brother who was callahan-
whose charity was a single drink of
rotgut last night montrose had
walked along the bar knowing the final
humiliation of being snubbed by pals
fearing a touch who indeed was
frank montrose-who had to sell his
body for a hundred dollars

  montrose took marcias hand in both
of his

  lead the way my dear he said

aloysio and dr fesler were
not sitting in the office this time
in fact they were not sitting at all
and dr fessler had a smirk on his
round face

  if we had done it my way he
chuckled he would never have met
the girl its not working out according
to plan is it

  dr aloysio laughed aloud

  my pretty brother  he sneered
my pretty foolish brother i i told
you that you were no artist-that you
lacked imagination he rubbed his
hands together cant you see it will


fantastic adventures

be better this way cant you imagine
that we will have more sport this way
dr fesler scowled

  all right all right but i still think
the old ways are best

  dr aloysio shook his head pity-
ingly

  no imagination no imagination
at ontrose parked his coupe at
the curb in front of the church
the car was like montrose himself
neat trim conservative he switched
off the motor and looked at marcia
sitting beside him

  montrose laughed softly

  you dont seem nervous marcia
smiled

 too much has happened he
replied the year has gone by too
darned fast

  it has been a good year hasnt it
darling

  a good year hmmn sole owner
of a nice little construction outfit
frank montrose builder twenty
thousand in the bank and
and

  it looks very much as though im
being dragged to the preacher to see
about getting married

  do you like the idea very much
when its the loveliest girl this side
of paradise this side say ill in-
clude paradise

  frank thats sacrilege and in
front of a church too

  in three weeks ill say it inside of
a church

  he lifted her chin and looked at her
god montrose thought im lucky
this girl-this wonderful girl-what
hasnt she done for me

  i think wed better go in marcia
said at last our appointments for
ten

  he nodded and let go her chin
montrose reached for the door handle
frank 

then-his hand dropped back

  he turned toward marcia

  what-what is it he stammered
you had the queerest lookof
strain as though you were lifting
something 

  montrose forced a grin

  i suppose im a little embarrassed
darling i havent been inside a church
for years

  is that it why youll love dr
eddison hes a real person-theres
nothing stuffy about him at all
marcia opened her door this time
montrose forced himself to get out and
started around to her side of the car
what the devil was wrong with him
his feet dragged his whole body
seemed not to co-ordinate

  montrose lifted a hand to help mar-
cia from the car missed her elbow and
almost fell

  frank

  he frowned

  marcia made a joke of it

  youre not supposed to lose your
gallantry until after were married
she chided

  montrose tried to grin

  i-i tried to help you he defended
himself i think i slipped or you
were too fast for me

  marcia was too fast for him going
across the sidewalk he could barely
force one foot in front of the other
suddenly frank montrose was scared
at the edge of the churchs lawn he
could move no further

  he was paralyzed

tvt arcia looked back over her
a shoulder at sight of his strain-
ing sweating face she rushed back to
to him

  darling are you ill

  what could he say to her he tried
to turn away from her back out of her
reach
contract for a body



  he could turn

  as soon as montrose tried to move
away from the church his feet moved
he took another step toward the car
the paralysis left him

  marcia hurried after him grabbed
his arm

frank darling say something
what could he say what kind of
paralysis was this why could he
move in one direction only mont-
rose tried to think very fast

  i-i dont feel so hot honey
sweat poured down his face suppose
its nervous indigestion-probably been
working too hard

  you do look ill frank im fright-
ened im taking you to a doctor
right now

  oh no no doctors something
was stirring far back of montroses
consciousness he could not define it
-he didnt full realize it-but it made
him feel strangely unclean he
had to be alone alone

  look he croaked just take me
home a couple of hours rest and ill
be okay ive had this before and i
know just what to do

  well all right but marcia still
looked uncertain you are looking a
little better thank goodness i never
saw anyone look lie-

  never mind montrose said hastily
just take me home and let me sleep
we can visit dr eddison tomorrow
as they drove away montrose lay
back in the seat and closed his
eyes his body felt completely relaxed
he wriggled his toes surrepititiously
flexed his arms movement was free
and unrestrained

  but crawling along the back of his
mind there was something  some
thought that would explain all this
and the explanation would not be
pleasant

  marcia took him to his apartment

made him lie down on the couch and
covered him with a blanket

  when you wake up call me she
ordered ill fix your lunch and
your dinner too

  she smoothed back his hair and
smiled down at him

  youll make a wonderful wife he
grinned

  you go to sleep-or you wont make
such a much of a husband fainting
on the public streets

  did not faint

  he grinned and closed his eyes her
lips brushed his and she was gone
montrose did not see the worried look
she gave him just before closing the
door

  montrose waited for a while then
he arose went to the kitchen for a
bottle and glass and came back to the
couch carefully methodically he
poured and drank three drinks

  the rye failed to warm him it did
not relax his mind allowing all his
thoughts to form montrose poured a
fifth drink he raised it to his lips
then stopped it came to him then
that this was the way he used to meet
problems drink them out of existence
that had stopped with the coming of
marcia

  but you couldnt tell marcia that you
had a one-way paralysis why not
well you just couldnt

tvjt ontrose stood up he stretch-
ed slowly raising himself on tip-
toe his body felt fine clenching his
fists at his sides he jogged in place for
several minutes swinging his arms
violently he performed several spec-
tacular bending exercises

  im all right montrose gloated
im thirty-four and ill bet i could run
a hundred in ten flat in fact ill go
over to the gym and prove it

  he was a little tight of course but


fantastic adventures

as he walked over to the gym his stride
was long and even and his body was
erect

  montrose looked at his nude body
before putting on a gym suit not a
blemish stomach flat shoulders broad
a damn good bodyl

  hi frank what is this an adonis
act

  dr sam halsey his chunky body in
gym trunks stood at the end of the row
of lockers grinning widely at him
montrose blushed then laughed

  hello sam im developing a new
fixation for you to play around with
ive fallen in love with my big toe
listen bud grinned halsey you
wouldnt expect a big-shot alienist like
me to fool with that would you

  all right big shot just how would
you cure it

  simple halsey said with mock
gravity just amputate the toe

  the both laughed heartily

  say frank how about a few fast
rounds i havent had the gloves on
for a month

  swell nodded montrose check
em out will you while i get a suit
on

  montrose slid easily between the
ropes and went to one corner of the
ring the padded canvas felt light and
springy beneath his feet he looked
warily over at halsey now going into
his customary crouch as montrose
edged out into the ring he remembered
the drinks have to keep halsey away
from the body today

  okay called halsey

  you may fire when ready gridley
halsey hunched his shoulders and
charged it was his usual attack
montrose taller and with a decided
edge in reach usually side-stepped that
first rush and did some deadly work
with a left jab

  not today however

  montrose extended his hand for the
jab that is he tried to extend it
his left and then his right came up
and covered his face-like a child shut-
ting his gaze off from some feared thing
nor did montrose side-step instead
he jumped wildly backward bounced
against the ropes then turned his back
to halsey and ran away from him
halsey stopped

  hey he grunted what goes
montrose crashed into the ropes at
the opposite side of the ring

  dont hit me he yelled you
mustnt hurt me

  halsey dropped his hands

  huh what did you say
montrose dropped his hands he
stared at halsey eyes glassy with fear
halsey frowned at that fixed stare
then montrose shook his head intel-
ligent fear replaced the hysteria in his
eyes

  wha-what did i say he stam-
mered

  halsey told him

  montrose looked down at his gloved
hands

t t alsey went over to him he laid
-  a glove on montroses shoulder
noticing the involuntary wince as he
raised the glove

 tell me frank it was the
psychiatrist speaking now whats
wrong

  montrose did not lift his head

  i-oh hell sam i might as well
tell the truth i was scared i had to
cover up-run away so you couldnt
hit me

you were afraid of getting hurt
thats it montrose raised his
head and looked beseechingly at the
other you know im not a coward
sam

  sure i do soothed halsey now
you and i are getting dressed and then
contract for a body



well go over to my office somethings
bothering you fellow and ill find out
what it is

  they had quite a talk halsey
opened a bottle of very good scotch
let montrose have all he wanted in
half an hour montrose was telling the
story of his life when he had finished
halsey fiddled with his key chain for
a while then grinned at montrose

  i envy you he said youve been
places and done things

  im a lot happier right here in
pleasanton

  with a girl like marcia you
should be frank

  halsey cleared his throat

  you see frank marcias really the
crux of the matter tell me does she
know about this deal you made with
the hospital

  god nol as a matter of fact id
forgotten it myself-until today
halsey nodded

  i see well fellow you havent
forgotten about it at least your sub-
conscious has made quite a play with
that fact

  whats that got to do with marcia
frowned montrose

  a guilt sense subconsciously you
believe that your body doesnt belong
to you any more you cant marry
marcia with a body that doesnt belong
to you its cheating yourself and
her

  montrose fiddled with his empty
glass

  that sounds pretty far-fetched to
me sam he muttered i dont quite
get it

  look halseys voice was patient
youre a high strung imaginative fel-
low youre deeply in love with mar-
cia you feel that she has re-made
your life-which she has and because
of this-this sale of your body-you
dont feel worthy of her that

rankles 

  and thats why i-i couldnt go
in the church

  sure

  then what do i do

  halsey leaned back in his chair grin-
ning widely

  i wish i could cure all my patients
as easily he looked at his watch
lets see its noon you get the one
oclock plane to the city go over to
the hospital and buy back that damn
bill of sale tear it up-come back
here-and ill get tight at your wed-
ding

  montrose hesitated then rose slowly
from his chair

  are you sure sam

  of course i am

  we-ellit sounds good but
ive had the feeling as though this was
something i didnt know about-some-
thing i personally couldnt control

tte paid the driver and stood for
a moment staring curiously at the
small hospital actually he was seeing
it for the first time montrose walked
slowly up the tiled walk his hand
slowed a little as he reached to push
open the door a vague uneasiness
crept over him

  a brisk middle-aged woman in a
severe suit looked up from the switch-
board as montrose approached
yes

  id like to see dr aloysio

  dr aloysio does not see anyone
without an appointment

  i think he will know me mr
frank montrose im in the city for
just an hour or two and its very
urgent

  all right the woman said doubt-
fully ill call him

  montrose turned away as she plugged
in the call the air was still heavy
with the hospital smell but in the


fantastic adventures

afternoon light the place was certainly
different more cheerful he tried to
picture the haunting gloom of his pre-
vious visit

  dr aloysio does not know you
sir montrose swung back to face her
if you will state your business he will
give you an appointment

  montrose frowned had the doctor
forgotten of course not no one
even j p morgan forgets giving out
a hundred dollars then what went on
here

  ask dr aloysio to think again
montrose snapped just mention one
hundred dollars to him

  the womans mouth tightened

  dr aloysio has an excellent memo-
ry she grated he said that he had
never heard of you

  montrose paled the woman flinch-
ed a little before the blazing fire in his
eyes blind hot anger surged over
him the day had been terrible
enough without this last unreasonable
complication

  i think he grated that i can soon
convince dr aloysio that he does re-
member me 

  he strode down the corridor to the
office door the woman started to rise
then hastily plugged in a line

  montrose jerked open the door and
stalked into the office of dr aloysio

  dr aloysio was seated at the big
desk

  who are you sir there was
restrained anger in the clipped tones
what do you want

  montrose stood in front of the desk
he leaned forward palms of both
hands flat on the desks oaken top

  take a good look dr aloysio
he said as calmly as he could dont
you remember me now

  the cold eyes behind the glasses
gave no hint of recognition

  i do not sir

  the doctors phone rang the doc-
tor ignored montrose completely as he
lifted it from its cradle

  yes yes he is here now if i
do not phone you in five minutes
summon two orderlies

  that was wrong even in his anger
montrose remembered the other voice
the dr aloysio had been pompous
wordy now

  the devil with that a mans voice
is different at different times and
he wasnt here to worry about this
damned doctors vocal characteristics
montrose took out his wallet and took
out a hundred dollars

  lets cut out the foolery dr aloy-
sio he snapped there is a hundred
dollars take it and give me back the
agreement 

  dr aloysio stared at the bill

  my dear sir he said i do not
know you at all still less do i know
what you are talking about

  he almost convinced montrose the
hand that held the money wavered
drew back dr aloysio permitted
himself a small nod that jerked
montrose back to his taut fury

ttolding himself in as best he
- could montrose jerked out the
story of the episode of a year ago dr
aloysios eyes widened then narrowed
in a stare of clinical appraisal when
montrose had finished he arose walked
around the desk and stood in front of
montrose

  mr montrose he said you are
obviously not drunk from a cursory
examination i would think you sane-
sane but at present emotionally un-
balanced you-

  i did not come here for an examina-
tion montroses voice rose damn
it to hell-ive had a bad day-im
not going to stand here and let you
make it worse i dont know what
contract for a body



your motive is and i dont give a damn i
but damn you-tell me you didnt
write this if you can

  montrose tossed the money on the
desk it slipped to the floor but neither
man noticed it his whole body was
trembling as montrose jerked out his
wallet again his fingers probed awk-
wardly for the agreement found it
creased and worn he smoothed it out
held it in front of the doctors face

  take a look at that you wrote
it and your fat friend fesler watched
you write it

  fesler dr fesler

  oh god cried montrose wont
you stop it he was here in the office
with you

  dr aloysio lost his impersonal calm
for the first time his voice was hesi-
tant as he said

  my good friend dr fesler died
three years ago

  there was a loud knock at the door
go away boys called aloyiso
its all right

as retreating footsteps sounded down
the hall aloysio held out his hand
let me see that agreement please
montrose handed it over aloysio
looked at it carefully he sighed most
of his professional aplomb came back

  i did not write that mr montrose
wait as montrose opened his mouth
he opened a drawer in the desk here
is one of my notebooks compare the
handwritings

  montrose did so the room teetered
crazily his anger left him to be re-
placed with a crawling snickering fear
the handwriting of the agreement was
not that of dr aloysio from afar off
montrose seemed to hear a wild jeer-
ing laugh

  here man cried dr aloysio
sit down

  montrose felt his arm taken was
steered to a chair he felt himself fall

into an easy chair heard the doctor
move back to his desk then the sharp
fumes of smelling salts cleared his
fogged brain

  dr aloysio put the glass stopper
back on the bottle

im sorry his voice was kind i
didnt understand you seem to be the
victim of some ghastly kind of joke
but montrose did not quit just yet
he forced himself to sit erect

  dr feslers dead eh he croaked
how about the fellow at the switch-
board

  dr aloysio shook his head

  we had to discharge him about ten
months ago for drunkenness he was
totally unreliable he took out cigar-
ettes gave one to montrose and lit it
you see mr montrose at the time
you mention i myself was in bed with
a severe attack of pleurisy i can only
conclude that someone with the con-
nivance of the man at the switchboard
played a joke on you

  montrose stumbled to his feet he
stared at dr aloysio for a long while
then began to laugh crazily

  somebody bought my body he
cried where am i going to buy it
back

  dr aloysio took montroses arm
montrose shook it off and staggered
toward the door

  going to get drunk he mumbled
drink all this-all of it-right out of
existence

  you cant do that cried the doc-
tor stay here until you calm
down-

 but frank montrose had gone
through the door as he reeled down
the corridor montrose saw nothing of
his surroundings but his crazed mind
seemed to hear jeering laughter

tjuddy said the cab driver

this hack aint a hotel room


fantastic adventures

  the nasal voice penetrated mont-
roses consciousness he opened his
eyes montrose shook his head then
stopped abruptly leaning over the
back of the drivers seat the cabbie
grinned without mirth

  you look like a wreck buddy he
said

  i feel it montroses voice was
thick where are we

  were at the airport remember
airport what airport my god
-am i still in the city

  the driver nodded

  yep he glanced casually over
montroses wrinkled suit soiled shirt
his eye paused at the unshaven chin
i would say pal that youve seen a
lot of our fair city

  montrose turned his head looking
outside he was surprised to see it was
broad daylight

  its morning he muttered

  sure monday morning-
  monday

  sure

  monday montrose had come down
on friday what had happened-a
three day drunk why there was
a whole covey of butterflies in his
stomach but he forced himself to think

  and slowly the picture came back
of the doctor and his terrible proof
that hed never written that purchase
agreement of montrose running from
the hospital helpless alone-making
for the nearest bar then lots of
bars drunk the old way out the
way hed always taken when things
went wrong

  go on to the airport montrose
cried is there a plane soon

  yeah you got any dough left
buddy

  montrose opened his wallet a ticket
and a single ten were all he had left
the driver nodded at the money and
started up his cab montrose saw

marcias picture in his billfold mar-
cia

  a three day drunk-while marcia
had probably gone crazy with worry
no-frank montrose was the crazy
one what had been this business of
a body a body sold to a doctor that
didnt exist montrose laughed may-
be the body didnt exist either

  the noise of the planes motors was
definitely not soothing montrose clasp-
ed his aching head between his hands
and tried to think he couldnt it
might have been the hangover-very
likely it was but he couldnt quite
focus his mind on any one matter

  when he arrived in pleasanton the
problem of marcia forced everything
else from his mind for a while horror
went away replaced by a purely normal
worry as to how he was going to square
things with her

  he had just finished drying himself
after an icy shower when his doorbell
rang it was marcia

 frank oh frank-what hap-
pened are you all right

  she held out her hands and for a
brief moment he was safe in her em-
brace everything else forgotten then
she drew back

  frank she said slowly i think
you owe me an awful lot of explana-
tion

  marcia looked closely at him mont-
rose hadnt shaved yet and it would
take several nights sleep to clear up
his eyes montrose jammed his fists
tight into the pockets of his dressing
gown he tensed with the effort of
meeting her eyes but couldnt quite
make it

  i guess i went on a tear honey
he muttered

  marcia looked at his clothes still
heaped where he had thrown them
then she walked slowly over to a win-
dow and looked out
contract for a body



  i guess you did she said uwhy
  i dont know

  marcia turned and faced him but
she did not move toward him

  frank her voice was low but clear
do you really want to marry me
good god pain rang in his voice
how can you doubt it

  frank her tone was controlled
your behavior at the church was very
strange i believed you when you said
you were ill yet-i couldnt help think-
ing that you looked frightened

tvt ontroses mouth twisted god
forbid she should ever know just
how scared hed been but not of
her

  then marcia went on you called
me and said you must fly down to the
city you were to be back for dinner
you were gone three days-without a
word to me

  the sunlight streamed through the
window giving her loveliness a golden
frame her beauty hurt him what
could he say

  the truth

  what was the truth

  like any man in his position mont-
rose tried to postpone the inevitable

  look marcia he said i honest-
ly dont know when i ate last would
you wait while i finish dressing then
have some breakfast with me

  ive already eaten

  well watch me then he exclaim-
ed and then ill explain everything
honest

  montrose stepped toward her his
hands outstretched pleading marcia
shrugged

  all right frank she sighed

  they walked silently along marcia
stared straight ahead her silence
creating a distance between them but
montrose didnt mind he had arrived
at a decision he would tell her every-

thing making no attempt to explain
it just give her the whole story then
it would be up to marcia at least
she would give him no balderdash
like halseys pat theories yes or no
-and he would stand or fall at her
word

  at the next corner just a few short
steps from the restaurant it happened
a commonplace sort of accident an
old lady walking blindly against a
traffic light blundered in the path of an
oncoming truck

  frank marcia screamed

  montrose tried to move he could
have reached the old woman in time
jerked her back to safety a police-
man blew his whistle lumbered toward
them

 but montrose could not move
paralysis flowed over him he panted
with the struggle to move

  the expression on marcias face
changed suddenly and terribly and
completely then she started for the
street and now there wasnt enough
time the truck would have smashed
them both marcia and the old woman

  the lumbering policeman threw him-
self forward caught marcias arm at
the last incredible moment the little
old lady saw her danger she dodged
back to safety

  the paralysis left montrose

 marcia marcia he screamed
he ran to her darling are you all
right

  of course shes all right boomed
the cop i may have bruised her arm
a bit but shes okay arent you
miss

  yes

  marcia and the policeman stared at
montrose

  thank you officer she said at last
you saved my life you know

  now now the big face reddened
he scowled at montrose youd better


fantastic adventures

take a little more care of your girl im
thinking he turned away now
where did the old lady go that one
needs a lecture i

  marcia stammered montrose i
-i

  he reached for her hand marcia
drew back

  you just stood there she breathed
too frightened to move

  her lip quivered then her head
went high

  youre a coward frank i know
it id never forget it

  her hands clasped together came
apart marcia held something out to-
ward him it was the ring hed given
her

  someone laughed montrose was
suddenly conscious that others were
watching him he stared wildly around
caught sight of the cop there was a
look of approval on the officers face

  but

  montrose lifted his hands there
was a clink as the ring fell at his feet
montrose let his hands drop to his
sides

  as marcia walked away her shoul-
ders slumped a little then began to
tremble but there was nothing now
that montrose could do

  move on growled the policemtn
pick up your ring and beat it

    fesler if he can still be
    called that smirked at dr aloysio

  well whats so funny snapped
the latter

  you look so ridiculous in that get-
up wheezed fesler as an old lady
brother you are definitely comic i

  dr aloysio waved a hand and was
himself again

  damn it he growled it was
such a neat plan to have him look
on helpless while his beloved was
smashed to bits by a truck

  ah well grinned fesler destiny
fights on my side there are limita-
tions 

  aloysio laughed suddenly

  the plan unfolds now dear broth-
er get ready to pay me

owaying with the motion of the
 train montrose lurched up to the
lounge cars bar

  a bottle of rye he ordered

  the attendant handed over a bottle
you gonna drink all that befo we
get to los angeles sah

  im going to damn well try to
growled montrose keep the soda
and ice coming

  he sat alone in the far corner of the
car as the hours passed the car
gradually emptied itself of passengers
montrose drank steadily oblivious of
his surroundings he stared down at
the jolting floor drinking smoking
and staring

  beg pahdon sah but even this train
has to close up at two oclock 

  montrose looked up at the white-
jacketed attendant

  is it that late he exclaimed
suah is dont you think sah you
ought to go to bed

  montrose scowled

  think im drunk

  the porter glanced at the nearly
empty bottle then looked long and hard
at montrose his eyes rolled a little

 why-i guess you aint sah
though you suah oughta be

  then get the hell out of here and let
me alone

  montroses mouth twisted in a sneer
no control he muttered wearily his
body wouldnt even respond to alcohol
any more his memory checked back
over the past week that terrible
week of trying to see marcia of finally
giving her up and then after the
athletic club had kicked him out and
contract for a body



he had lost two cinch contracts selling
his business at a loss and leaving town

  during that time he had tried to get
tight but he never had he couldnt
do it now

  montrose leaned back in his chair
in careful order he marshaled the main
events of his life an ordinary wastrel
at first until that night at the hospital
then hed found some very fine things
-only to lose them events-events
he could not control-events had order-
ed him about

  he sat upright dazedly he con-
templated that fact he held out his
hands and blinked at them they
werent really his for he couldnt al-
ways control them montrose looked
down at his feet-the feet that had
refused to enter the church

  then it was true-he had sold his
body but to whom how could he
he ever redeem it montrose picked
up his glass and emptied it well he
thought the old hands will still bring
liquor to the old mouth and the old
mouth will still swallow he drank
again perhaps he did get a little
drunk for he began to think of marcia
-even saw her face shadowy and
vague float before his own

  and then montrose became angry
he had been cheated the sale had
been made for delivery after death
and they whoever they were had
taken possession before-before the
lease expired montrose laughed at
his own thoughts then grew serious
it was no joke-he had been cheated

  a crafty gleam grew in his eyes he
looked down the cars length to the
vestibule door that would do very
nicely he frank montrose would do
a little cheating on his own account
he got to his feet picked up the rye
and drank from the bottle setting
the bottle down he started slowly down
the car

  he opened the door of the vestibule
and stood on the steps the wind
whipped his face montrose stood
there for a moment balanced pre-
cariously his glance dropped to the
ground a grey blur under the trains
speed it seemed to draw him

  yes that was it nothing mattered
now since he had lost marcia and
himself clinging to the handrail with
one hand he swung himself around
between the two cars this would be
ideal his body would be mangled be-
yond all recognition-there would be
absolutely nothing left to collect

  laughing aloud montrose let go the
rail

  a hand caught his for a moment
montrose dangled then the hand that
gripped his pulled him back mont-
rose banged against the car his feet
scraped over the steps one more pull
and he was crouched on his knees in
the vestibule he heard the outside
door close then a laugh grated against
his consciousness

  mr montrose that was cheat-
ing sir

  montrose looked up dr aloysic
stood before him eyes sparkling be-
hind the black-rimmed glasses high
forehead gleaming palely in the dark-
ness

  you montrose screamed

  he staggered to his feet

  of course i must protect my in-
terests if you had-ah succeeded
how could i have obtained my pro-
perty

  montrose staggered forward the
doctors figure wavered blurred then
disappeared

  montrose fainted

phe porter and the conductor
accepted his explanation that he
had fainted although it was obvious
both thought him lying as montrose


fantastic adventures

lay sleepless in his berth he heard the
porter come and listen several times
outside the curtains

  but he did not care he left the
train at los angeles smiling slightly
at the porters sigh of relief at his going
but it was surface amusement only
frank montrose considered himself no
longer of this world his mind was
fixed on death for death the proper
kind of death would break the bargain
make him a winner at last

  he checked his bags at the station
and set out on an aimless walk he
was not surprised to discover he had no
hangover as he walked montrose
passed a small church his footsteps
walked on religion had always meant
little to him and since he didnt quite
believe in god he couldnt accept the
devil either

  had he been more imaginative he
might have gone insane

  all he did was to stop at an occa-
sional bar and drink a little not that
he wanted to get drunk even if he
could have gotten drunk drinking
was just something to do

  it was at the third bar that the idea
hit him he grinned slowly as the idea
unfolded in his mind when the plan
had perfected itself he chuckled aloud
he lifted his glass in a silent toast to
his success and drank deeply for the
first time in days the rye tasted good
to him

  fill her up he said

  the bartender did so

  say montrose said genially id
like to ask you a question

  the bartender rubbed the bar with
a dirty towel

  shoot his voice was bored

  montrose leaned over the bar

  well he said i was just thinking
suppose a guy is executed in this state
what happens to his body

  the bartender stared

  jeez he exclaimed youre mor-
bid pal

  montrose shook his head

  not at all he grinned im a
crime writer just blew in here im
going to do some free-lance stuff

i dunno he said guess the
nearest of kin gets it if they want it
otherwise-yeah im sure of it
whats that montrose found the
barkeeps mind a little hard to follow

  theres a cemetery at the prison
i know that cause i was up there once
as a visitor of course

  sure nodded montrose

  fella i was visitin pointed it out
to me if you get executed and they
aint no relatives why they bury you
right there in the prison grounds
fine thanks a lot montrose
beamed have one on me

  later maybe the bartender
moved off gotta take care of those
loudmouths at the other end first

tjven the clamor of the omnipresent
 juke-box sounded pleasant to
montroses ears he was at peace with
the world carefully he went over the
plan in his mind it was foolproof
there would be unpleasant aspects of
course he could not help shuddering
at the final scene but it was all
compensated for yes it made every-
thing even

  hi pal said a voice at his shoul-
der

  montrose turned his head a thin
nondescript sat down beside him
whatll yuh have pal

  the newcomer was at that stage of
drunkenness when all the world was
his friend montrose started to turn
away then looked back at the lush it

might as well be now he thought

  why montrose said id like
another rye

  fine george two more ryes he
contract for a body



leaned toward montrose thas not
his real name but i always call im
that

  why not it saves time

  zactly wha i say he nodded at
montrose mighty happy to have
drink with me been drinkin with
some of the fines peoplen lossanglus
mnames hayes jus call me perry
thas firs name

 glad to know you im frank
montrose

  they drank

  always say lassanglus fines place
in world with fines people said mr
hayes knew moment i saw you you
fines of em all

  mr hayes nodded his head with
great emphasis and almost fell off his
stool

  oh said montrose im fine
enough i guess im also pretty
smart

  so hayes eyes grew round with
wonder me im dumb

  you look dam intelligent to me
said montrose

  hayes beamed they had more rye
the bartender moved back to his loud-
mouths at the other end montrose
looked over the bar and saw a short
knife used for cutting lemons he
leaned over the bar snatched up the
knife and stuck it in his coat pocket

 whaddye do tha for asked
hayes

  a bet grinned montrose pal
of mine bet me ten bucks i couldnt
lift it say he faced the goggling
hayes youre just the guy i need
a witness

  hayes giggled

  look said montrose you saw
me lift the knife how about coming
along and helping me collect the bet
then you and i will really paint this
town what say

  sure s a goodidea hayes fished

for more money

  drinks are on me said montrose

  nossir hayes became stubborn
youre my gues imbuyin

  montrose shrugged it was low
somehow to let hayes pay in light of
what was going to happen to hayes
but he didnt dare argue with a drunk
a drunks reactions are too unpredict-
able

  hayes paid and they left the bar
arm in arm

  montrose walked slowly pretending
to stagger a little waiting until they
came to an intersection there was a
traffic policeman in the middle of the
street a couple of men were just
stepping off the curb on the other side
of the street plenty of witnesses

  montrose shrugged off hayes arm
and pulled the knife

  all right sucker he said loudly
hand over that roll you were sporting
in the saloon

  hayes giggled

  come on montrose grabbed his
shirt gimme the dough or ill let you
have it

 hey leggo mumbled hayes
don play so rough pal

  montrose shook him and raised the
knife

  leggo cried hayes he quailed
to sobriety before the awful threat in
montroses eyes help he screamed
once

jvfontrose sunk his knife in the
others chest turned and ran
squarely into the arms of the police-
man

  youre under arrest bellowed the
cop i saw you plain as day it was
murder 

 yeah montrose dropped the
knife i-i killed him

  he could not look at the small
crumpled body


fantastic adventures

  but officer you dont under-
stand

  the two men from across the street
stepped briskly up to the policeman
the officer saw two well-dressed men
one tall the other short and portly to
his practised eye they meant one thing
-importance

  montrose saw in them the things he
still called dr aloysio and dr fesler

  what do you mean rasped the
policeman

  we saw it all said the tall man
my friend here and i this man
was walking along pleasantly and
amiably with the-other one we left
the same bar they did just a minute
or so after them

  the street began to rock under
montrose the policeman scowled
well i- he grumbled

  the plump man spoke up

  the dead man tried to quarrel with
his friend in the bar just as they
reached the corner here he became
angry again he jerked out a knife
and assaulted the gentleman youre
holding we saw him pull the knife
away but the other chap seemed to
slip and fall right on the knife

  but i killed him screamed mont-
rose it was murder

  the tall man clucked

  poor chap he murmured shock
youd be hysterical too officer if youd
just killed a friend

  the cop was still unconvinced

  who the hell are you anyway he
growled how do i know this isnt
some kind of frame-up

  the two gentlemen presented cards
as the policeman read the names his
voice lost its growl and he became very
deferential

  oh it seemed he said their names
but oddly enough montrose couldnt
hear him

  but montrose didnt care anyway

there was one more chance if he ran
now the cop would shoot even if he
werent killed flight would be a sure
sign of guilt he stumbled forward

  look out it was the one mont-
rose knew as dr aloysio the poor
chap is fainting

  and montrose was fainting the
whole seething scene spun around into
a vast sneering portrait of dr aloysio
then dr aloysio receded into the
leering blackness but not before dr
aloysio had leaned forward and whis-
pered in montroses ear

  please mr montrose dont you
realize by now you cant cheat me
your body is mine you know 

tt ours later montrose stood calm-
ly in the courtroom while the
traffic officer mumbled his testimony
and the other two gave their version
of the tragedy when it was his turn
montrose spoke patiently as though
repeating a lesson word for word
he gave an account that tallied exactly
with that of the two doctors as
he talked his only sensation was one
of vast pity for poor perry hayes

  the judge called it justifiable homi-
cide and dismissed the case

  montrose turned to go aloysio and
fesler walked on either side of him
at the sidewalk montrose turned

 damn you he said slowly
viciously why dont you collect now
im tired of it i dont know who you
are-or what happened to me but
take your body im sick of it

  dr aloysio shook his head sadly
ah mr montrose he murmured
the fault is yours you dont know
how to live-at a leased body you
dont know how to take advantage of
it

  his words pounded against mont-
roses mind even as the two seemed
to fade in the bright sunlight
contract for a body



yhe bartender sliced a lemon
slowly and methodically the
joint was as yet but slightly crowded
and he wasnt very busy

  hi sounded a familiar voice
let go that lemon and shake hands
with me

  callahan looked up

  monty he croaked

  his face creased into a smile
monty he repeated  tis good
to see ye lad

  callaghan looked montrose over
carefully  then he reached below the
bar and took out a dusty bottle of very
old baltimore rye it was his seal of
approval on what he saw

  me boy he said as he poured ye
look very prosperous and im glad to
see it

  prosperous montroses eyes grew
bleak well ive got lots of money
and i can do lots of things but i
wouldnt exactly say id prospered
talkin in riddles hey well
heres to ye

  they drank callaghan cast a look
up and down the bar saw nothing that
needed his attention then leaned for-
ward elbows on the bar

  last time i saw ye was over a year
ago ye were on yer uppers then
montrose laughed

  i started my comeback that very
night got a tip from jack rann
which reminds me his voice was
casual is he here

  callaghan scowled

  he is

  thats fine ive been looking for
him

   why

  montrose waved his hand airily
well to be frank with you cal
im going to kill jack rann

  somebody should do that the
irishman did a double take what
did ye say monty he whispered

  i said i was going to kill rann
montrose replied

  callaghan threw up his hands
yere drunk agin monty why
dont you lay off the stuff and dont
you start no ruckus in my place
montrose took out an initialed
leather cigarette case with steady
fingers he chose a smoke lit it and
flicked the match away after a deep
drag he smiled at callaghan

  cal old boy he drawled i am
not drunk and you know it and i
wont start anything ill just shoot
him thats all

  callaghans face purpled

  did ye ever hear of the electric
chair boy didnt ye know they exe-
cute people for murder

  not me montrose spoke quite
seriously ive already tried it and
i cant be caught youll see
callaghan found himself believing
the other unbelief could not stand up
before the easy confidence of montrose
the irishman was afraid terribly
afraid

  yere not crazy callaghan stated
  no

  then what have ye done-sold yer
soul to the devil

  montrose shook his head

  no he said not my soul cal

allaghan watched him walk to
 where jack rann sat unfortun-
ately a customer summoned him so
callaghan never did hear what was
said

  it wasnt very much

  montrose stared confidently into
ranns slate eyes watched them widen
with recognition

   lo chum rann said what
are you doing back here

  just a little visit smiled montrose
came to pay you your commission on
a sale


fantastic adventures

  commission

  yes remember when you advised
me to sell my body to a hospital

  rann frowned then he smiled what
was for him a wide smile

  did that really work he chuckled
he hesitated taking in montroses ap-
pearance with a quick glance then
he said sit down and tell me about it
you know i used to wonder just what
put that idea in my mind

  really montrose remained stand-
ing

  yeah i didnt know anything
about it chum i was just tryin to
get rid of you

  it worked rann i got the hundred
and a lot of other things things i
didnt bargain for but you deserve
your commission even on the other
things

  montrose took a gun from his pocket
and pointed it at jack rann

  hey

  ranns face turned a dirty gray

  i never liked you montrose said
calmly that night i hated you i
still do i wouldnt bother with this
if i thought i ran any risk

  put that gun away pal youll-
youll burn

  no  wont

  rann began to beg in a high hysteri-
cal voice he fell to the floor and
writhed like a worm among the litter of
cigarette butts montrose watched with
an almost clinical detachment

  in a fragment of time that seemed
endless montrose recapitulated the
situation he was going to kill jack
rann this groveling creature who had
lost all dignity he felt a sense of
pleasure deep inside himself this was
the way to use a leased body to ad-
vantage he could go about and de-
stroy all worthless men-with impu-
nity ano no man-made punishment
would be his this body was sacred

to some higher power

  from the corner of his eye he caught
movement callaghan had thrown a
bottle of whiskey at him still with an
amused detachment montrose marked
the arc of the bottle it looked like
a true throw yet it would not hit him
would not destroy his aim as they
had allowed him to kill perry hayes
so would they allow him to kill jack
rann and no reprisal

  it was really fun he chuckled a
little as he pointed the gun down at
rann that bottle flying hard and
true would be swerved aside by   
somehting or it would disappear in
mid-flight how these barflies would
goggle

tte held the gun steady and began

	-- to squeeze the trigger the bottle
reached the top of its flat parabola and
began to drop toward his hand he
put a little more pressure on the trigger
the bottle came on he squeezed hard
on the trigger a fraction of a second
behind the impact of the bottle

  it crashed into the gun knocked his
hand to one side the roar and flash
of the gun deafened and blinded him
the bullet buried itself in the floor

  montroses jaw went slack he look-
ed idiotically at the gun

  what does it mean he muttered
to himself what does it mean
jack rann leaped up with desperate
despair and wrenched the gun from
montroses limp hand he pointed it
at montrose

  you saw him he babbled tried
to kill me im protecting myself
youre witnesses he flung a wild
glance at the bartender im justified
in killing him youll testify cal
but you cant kill me montrose
said as if to a child this body cant
be hurt its being saved for-some-
thing im not afraid you see
contract for a body



  it struck him with a blinding impact
im not afraid

  what did it mean hed always
been afraid before a fear that came
from outside himself had sent him flee-
ing from the gloved fists of dr sam
halsey had held him paralyzed when
death plunged at marcia but now
that fear was gone

  he thought why im about to be
killed i can be killed

     he cried aloud in wild exultation
i can be killed oh thank god i
can be killed im free free kill me
jack this is wonderful

  jack rann dropped his arm he
looked at montrose with a kind of
puzzled fear youre crazy mont-
rose i cant shoot a crazy man
then ill kill myself montrose
cried oh god but im happy

  he turned and ran out the door
laughing insanely he plunged into the
street

  brakes screamed horns cried in
torture a yellow laundry truck lifted
montrose on a front fender sent him
flying through a short arc

tead men feel no pain through
a fog of it montrose told himself
this over and over and over dead
men feel no pain

  he hadnt died then presently he
opened his eyes he saw brown hair
curling gently against a remembered
face grey eyes anxiously fixed on his
powder blue sheathed a lovely figure

  marcia he said softly without
wonder stating a simple but beautiful
truth marcia

  youre going to live frank youre
going to live darling thats the im-
portant thing

  is it he asked dully they
cheated me again they took away the
fear only to fool me the evil evil
scum

  you mustnt talk dear she
soothed youll be out of your head
for a while but youre going to live
he looked at her he thought
pain i hurt i am hurt if this body
has been hurt   

  what happened to me he asked
my right foot hurts like hell

  a nurse came in you mustnt ex-
cite yourself she said pleasantly
you must gain strength

  whats the matter with my foot
he said tensely it-feels strange
what happened to it

  shh the nurse said shhh
he tried to sit up but fell back
gasping with pain i insist  he cried
tell me

  shh

  marcia set her jaw im going to
tell him i dont care what the doctor
said your foot was-

  miss powers the nurse said sharp-

y-

  your foot marcia said grimly
had to be amputated frank just
above the ankle

  i must ask you to leave the nurse
began

  i will not theres nearly a quart
of my blood in that body im going
to stay

  frank montrose was suddenly at
peace a beatific smile overspread his
face and the two women looked won-
deringly at him

  ive only got one foot he said
happily nobody-no thing-
would want me now

  i would marcia said stoutly i
would frank

  she straightened it out for him later
the news report she had seen man
rushes to save alley cat in traffic not
expected to live she had caught a
plane had given two transfusions over
a period of six days he had almost
died


fantastic adventures

 alley cat he repeated i
didnt-

  and it escaped marcia burbled
this roving reporter saw it wriggle
through the traffic and streak into a
barroom

ive only got one foot he mur-
mured i have never been so happy
marcia said and i accused you
once of cowardice you must have
been just-sick

  i can go in that church now mont-
rose said marcia will you-

  if i have to carry you she said

phen i pronounce you man and
-t wife the justice of the peace
said two dollars

  montrose kissed his bride and she
pulled back to look at him with a frown
she said nothing until she had wheeled
him out into the lazy afternoon
whats come over you frank

i was wondering he said still
abstracted if there are-uh entities
waiting outside the realm of ordinary
existence ready to pounce then   
what are you talking about she
demanded were married darling
they picked me up he went on
there was no rhyme or reason that i
can see then they flung me aside
without warning what purpose could
they have had what purpose
dont talk like that youre giving
me the shivers

  he grinned up at her ill never
mention it again if youll wheel me
home my rickshaw coolie ill show
you what purpose really is chop-chop
now

  yes massa she said

  theyre out there he thought as she
wheeled him home theyre out there
waiting who will be next who
will-

  it seemed to him that an unseen
hand had touched the breast pocket of

his coat he felt he took out a creased
paper he opened it remembering

  i frank montrose of my own free
will do hereby assign to the full posses-
sion-

  it was signed by himself this was
the doctors copy of the agreement
why had it been returned he took
the other from his wallet and tore both
copies to shreds

  is that our marriage license mar-
cia asked chuckling

  just an old memorandum he said

  and it seemed to him that he heard
soft laughter from-somewhere from
-some thing it wasnt jeering or
ominous it was merely laughter

  a weight seemed lifted from him
hurry he said to marcia and
laughed with her

the two oj them sat in impenetrable
darkness the darkness pulsated
with their laughter

  i believe i win our wager one
asked suavely

  yes the other conceded i must
admit brother that bodies in their
limited fashion are quite amusing
however i am convinced that the old
ways are best this was a pleasant ex-
periment but i shouldnt like it as a
regular routine

  i am enamored of it myself said
the first the unsuspected histrionic
talents i discovered in myself are fas-
cinating i am going to indulge in a
variation of this experiment

  on whom brother

  ah that is a question let me see
shall it be a man or a woman
which

  why not both

  a brilliant thought brother per-
haps you have the makings of an
imagination after all would you care
to join me

  to be sure brother
the magyar killer

	by sandy miller 

we americans take an awful ribbing
from foreigners about the play that
newspapers give to murders and mys-
teries most europeans have the idea that america
is one vast chicago-a battlegrqmd of gangsters
and murderers and killers they have the im-
pression that it is impossible to walk the streets
of this country without being armed with a
machine-gun but europe has had more than
its share of the very thing it deplores some of
the most famous and inexplicable crimes have
been committed on the continent in particular
hungary and its capitol city budapest offer
some of the most outre events the world has
ever seen

  perhaps this is only proper-hungary and the
transylvania mountain district has given us most
of our stories and legends about werewolves and
vampires one of the most famous of the mys-
teries is that of the cenchas foundry

  in nineteen twenty-three there operated in
budapest a rising young industrial establishment
the cenchas foundry it was a fairly large firm
for the city of that time for it had about forty
employees one of whom we are particularly con-
cerned with

  peter dushanyi was the foreman in charge of
he brand-new gas furnace that the company used
for melting copper and brass he had been work-
ing for the firm for a relatively short time but
had shown such interest and been so capable that
he had been promoted to his job very rapidly
he adored the furnace-was almost in love with
it and he tended it with the concern of a man
looking after his first-bom little was known
of dushanyi except that his other mad passion
was a love for reading-particularly stories of
the outre and weird type his room was laden
with such books

 the reason he became known and almost a
cause celebre was because of a mysterious mur-
der one monday morning september of that
year the body of domana karic another foundry
worker was found in front of the copper-melting
furnace the mans head had been bashed in
with a heavy bar of some kind routine police
action was immediately taken karic had no
known enemies had been a friend of everyone
and his death was completely inexplicable the
police examined everyone in the plant carefully
but nothing was found out only two peculiari-
ties were noted about the corpse it was lying
on its face in front of the furnace with its hands
stretched out as if in worship of a god and in
addition there was a slight nick or cut in its

throat to the superstitious hungarian workmen
that meant vampirism but of course the police
laughed at the thought never-the-less in spite
of all that could be done his murderer was not
located and the case was closed there the mat-
ter rested and it would probably never have come
to anyones attention had not another incident
in the odd chain of events occurred

  the foreman peter dushanyi was found a few
months later dead in his room by his own hand
and he left a note which was a confession of the
murder of domana karic this naturally was a
surprise to everyone but more surprising was the
explanation dushanyi gave for his deed

  he wrote i peter dushanyi keeper of the
sacred flame evidently the furnace am the em-
bodiment of the sacred vampire of tothe and
because my god requested sacrifice i have com-
plied with his command domana karic was in
himself nothing but i chose him because he was
at the furnace while i was there i killed him and
i am glad to have done it the furnace needed a
soul to keep it content i provided it i am
taking my own life because my purpose on earth
has been fulfilled

 that was all there was to the note when
the story circulated around the plant workers
refused to approach the furnace believing that
the soul of karic inhabited it in fact the fac-
tory closed shortly thereafter due to the im-
possibility of getting sufficient help the major
oddity about the whole affair is that the police
never mentioned at least for public consumption
that dushanyi had a slight cut in his throat too

	thomas andrews 

thomas andrews irish chemist and
physicist was bom on december  
at belfast ireland where his father was a
linen merchant he studied medicine and the phys-
ical sciences at the university of glasgow edin-
burgh dublin and paris in  after practicing
as a physician for several years in his native city
he was appointed vice-president of the newly
established queens college belfast and professor
of chemistry offices which he held till  when
failing health compelled his retirement he then
resigned and devoted the rest of his life to research
he died on nov  

  the work on which his reputation mainly rests
and which best displayed his skill and resourceful-
ness in experiment was concerned with the lique-
faction of gases he carried out a very complete
enquiry into the laws expressing the relations of
pressure temperature and volume in carbonic
dioxide in particular establishing the conceptions
of critical temperature and critical pressure and
showing that the gas passes from the gaseous to
the liquid state without any breach of continuity

  when investigating the properties of certain
gases in  he reached the important conclusion
that for each one of them there is a definite degree
of temperature or absence of it above which no
amount of pressure will cause it to change into a
liquid below that figure a gas will sometimes
partially liquefy but precisely at it-called the
critical point-it passes at once into the liquid
state this point differs for each gas similarly
it has since been found that for each of them
there is also a definite pressure and temperature
figure at which alone the liquid will become a
solid in consequence of this discovery all the
known gases have since been reduced to the liquid
condition and all but helium to that of a solid

  andrews also made a special study of ozone and
to him is due the most of what is known at the
present time of the properties of that substance
technically considered it is an allotropic form of
the elementary gas oxygen that is one of the
states which the element can assume without loss
of its elementary character but which is accom-
panied by marked differences in some of its phys-
ical properties a number of the elements possess
this capacity notably sulphur phosphorus and
carbon and many chemists hold that allotropism

can occur with any of them given the proper con-
ditions inasmuch as it seems to be wholly a
molecular phenomenon the molecule of normal
oxygen consists of two atoms  when in that
state it is colorless tasteless and odorless if re-
duced to a liquid it is transparent displays a faint
blue tint and begins to boil and return to the
gaseous form at  c in the solid state it
presents a dead white appearance the molecule
of ozone consists f three atoms of oxygen os
possesses a faint bluish color but also a strong but
not unpleasant odor at  c it becomes un-
der the proper pressure a very deep blue almost
a black liquid which begins to boil at the tem-
perature of  c

zone was first observed in  by the dutch
student van marum who produced it un-
designedly when passing an electrical current
through some oxygen and detected its peculiar
odor he also noticed that the same effect was
always produced in the immediate vicinity of a
frictional electric machine in both cases he con-
cluded that it was the smell of electricity

  in  the same odor was observed by an eng-
lish chemist named cruikshank who was engaged
in decomposing some water by electricity this
time the phenomenon was ascribed to the acci-
dental presence of a little chlorine which if in very
small quantities has a somewhat similar effect on
the olfactory nerves

  finally in  the attention of the german
chemist schonbein was drawn to the matter and
after a prolonged research he announced in 
the discovery of a new gas giving it the name it
now bears a few years later the french chemist
soret demonstrated its true character as merely
an allotropic form of oxygen

  ozone is always present in minute quantities in
the atmosphere and in much larger quantities after
a violent thunderstorm during which it is pro-
duced giving the characteristic fresh and clean
effect so noticeable after such a storm has passed
away it is a more powerful oxidizing agent than
normal oxygen under confinement it will reduce
iron copper mercury and even silver from the
metalic state to that of the oxide and will rapidly
destroy rubber and vulcanite it is a powerful
bleaching agent and germ destroyer the latter


vignettes of famous scientists



property is sometimes employed in purifying the
air in hospitals whenever and wherever the at-
mosphere produces an exhilarating effect and im-
presses one as unusually fresh and clean it will
be found to contain temporarily more than its

average content in ozone the phenomenon is
natures way of purifying the sea of air we live
in when for any reason it has become abnormally
impure and unhealthful

leonhard euler was bom at basel switz-

  at the age of twenty and at the invitation of
the empress of russia catherine i euler joined
his friends in st petersburg and became an asso-
ciate of the academy of sciences there serving first
as a teacher of physics then of mathematics and
finally inspector of the geographical department
the severity of the climate and close application
to study affected his health and in  he lost the
sight of one eye and about thirty years later be-
came totally blind in spite of his severe handicap
he was throughout his life a persistent undaunted
and weariless investigator and teacher

  in  euler went to berlin at the command
of frederick the great and during the next twen-
ty-five years contributed many memoirs to the
prussian academy during this period he contin-
ued to contribute memoirs to the academy of st
petersburg and in  he obtained though with
difficulty permission to return to russia soon
afterwards a cataract formed in his left eye which
left him almost blind  with the help of his sons and
of krafft and lexell however he continued his
work in the next seven years he sent in 
memoirs to the academy and left in his papers
some  more he remained in st petersburg an
honored member of the faculty of the university
of that city until he died of apoplexy on septem-
ber  

  eulers greatest work was done in pure mathe-
matics and he must be regarded as one of the
founders of the modem science his writings on
mathematical subjects were remarkably numerous
and are regarded of the highest value for he pos-
sessed a style of unusual clearness and easy intelli-
gibility partial and even complete blindness did
not lessen his mental vigor when the latter mis-
fortune overtook him he employed as an amanu-
ensis a young german who was by trade a tailor
and whose mathematical education had never
progressed beyond the fundamentals to him he

dictated his remarkable introduction to algebra
in terms so clear and simple that his assistant as
the work advanced became an expert algebraist

culer treated trigonometry as a branch of
 analysis he introduced at the same time as
thomas simpson the abbreviations now used for
the trigonometric functions and made use of the
symbols e and he made many investigations
which were new in his time he discussed the gen-
eral equation of the second degree in three dimen-
sions and classified the surfaces represented by it
he showed that the conic sections were represented
by the general equation of the second degree in
two dimensions

  euler carried his great mathematical faculties
into the domain of physics he was the first to
deduce the equation of the curve of vibration in
the phenomena of light rays and to demonstrate
their relation to and dependence on the properties
of density and elasticity in the medium that car-
ried them-the ether of space as a corollary from
this he showed mathematically that in the phe-
nomenon of refraction it was the rays of greater
length-those towards the red end of the spectrum
-that underwent the smallest rate of dispersion
in passing through the prism in the face of the
statement by the great newton that a correction
of chromatic aberration was unattainable he in-
vestigated the subject so deeply and thoroughly
that he was able at the end to write a prescription
under which dollond the distinguished english
optician and instrument maker was able to con-
struct a combination of lenses of different qualities
of glass which were practically achromatic

  although eulers most important work was done
in pure mathematics he was a man of wide culture
interested in many branches of applied mathe-
matics and science he made important contribu-
tions to astronomy hydrodynamics and optics in
versatility of keen mental powers euler ranks with
leonardo da vinci of all the great mathemati-
cians that have arisen to date in the records of the
science he was preeminent in the faculty and habit
of using that wonderful tool in solving practical
problems in the arts for example he developed
a method of determining longitude at sea which
brought him a share of the  prize offered
by the british parliament the balance going to the
instrument maker harrison who constructed a
chronometer sufficiently accurate to be used for
the same purpose the one checking the results
indicated by the other

fantastic adventures

chocks benson paced his living
room carpet with the fervent
conviction that all the woes in
the world had been wrapped into a sin-
gle bundle and dumped upon his shoul-
ders though not a perceptible bundle
it weighed him down so heavily that he
groaned with every step

  tomorrow was the date of the niles
city air race and chocks would be
unable to compete for some human
snake had taken a wrench and with it
played a ghoulish tune upon the motor
of chocks plane and the plane as it
now lay in the hangar at the airport
would never fly again

  chocks groaned if he could enter
that race he knew hed have a good
chance of winning the  first prize
with that money he could open a little
flying school of his own and more than
that he would be able to marry pat
andrews who according to the general
concensus of opinion was the prettiest
little waitress that had ever taken an
order at the niles city airport lunch-
room

  but his plane was now just a hulk
of girders and cloth from which the
life had flown and that fact summed
up all his troubles for without a
plane he couldnt enter the race if he
didnt enter the race he wouldnt win
the prize if he didnt win the prize
he wouldnt be able to open up a flying
school and without a flying school he
wouldnt be able to marry pat an-
drews

  chocks kicked at the living room
carpet and because he was too pre-
occupied with the troubles didnt see
the carpet twitch remonstratingly for
a second he had imagined that the car-
pet was bert stevens and that he was
treating a certain portion of stevens
pants in the manner he had always
longed to treat them bert stevens was
the thorn in the side of chocks life

stevens too was an aspirant for the
hand of pat andrews and though he
had nothing in the way of looks and
personality to recommend him he had
a lot of influence in his pocketbook

  for bert stevens was the son of
horace m stevens and the name of
horace m stevens is synonymous with
oddles of money horace m stevens
owned a shoe factory up near carls-
ville the bank in niles city and sev-
eral other things too numerous to men-
tion suffice it to say that he had
plenty in the way of cash

  chocks knew that bert was entering
the race solely to see that he didnt
win  dollars was just a nice little
wad of pin money to bert stevens
stevens no doubt hoped that the
ignomony of losing would prejudice pat
against chocks

  chocks felt the load of woe upon his
shoulders settle deeper there was
nothing he could do he couldnt beg
borrow or steal a plane for every one
for miles around would be entered in
the race and he knew moreover that
hed never be able to get a plane as
fast as his had been

  before him chocks saw stretching a
desolate vista totally devoid of life
and happiness hed never be anything
more than a mere grease monkey tink-
ering with motors at some airport
some airport for after pat was mar-
ried to bert stevens he wouldnt want
to remain around niles city where the
iron would constantly be driven deeper
into his soul

  chocks stopped and slammed a fist
into the palm of his hand oh lord
he moaned if i could only fly in the
race tomorrow   if i could only
fly

   hocks was standing on the car-
 pet when he said that the carpet
twitched the edges curled up it shud-
air race



dered and gave a preliminary heave

  the next thing chocks knew he was
being borne aloft toward the ceiling
his head banged against plaster with
stunning force and he yelled in con-
fusion

  hey hey-what the  

  the edges of the carpet were press-
ing against the ceiling and chocks
was wrapped with all the comfort of a
bug in a rug but with none of the
bugs peace of mind

  hey let me down

  the carpet floated down from the
ceiling and came to rest with feather
softness upon the floor chocks scram-
bled to his feet and bounced off the
carpet he stood on the other side of
the living room his jaw hanging open

 n-n-now w-wha-what t-th the
hell chocks muttered

  but the carpet lay quietly on the
floor as good carpets should and for
a moment chocks was tempted to dis-
miss his recent escapade as a halluci-
nation the bump on his head how-
ever kept him convinced that it had
all been perfectly real

  not taking his eyes from the carpet
chocks sidled to a chair and sank
down he stared at the carpet it was
an old frayed and tattered carpet and
whatever design it might have had had
gone with the passing of years and the
rubbing of feet the sole distinction it
yet possessed was its arabian ancestry
chocks remembered the day his father
brought it home from an auction and
his mothers tirade which had followed
the carpet had lain in the attic neg-
lected for many years and only re-
cently had chocks brought it down to
cover the worn spot in the living room
rug

  and now chocks reflected the car-
pet had taken a bite out of the hand
which had taken care of it the carpet
lay on the floor quietly showing no fur-

ther indication of animation at last
chocks got up enough nerve to creep
up and peer at it narrowly still it re-
mained lifeless and to all indications
perfectly harmless

  he pressed the toe of a shoe upon
it gingerly but the carpet didnt move
in retaliation chocks felt a momen-
tary surge of disgust why he had
walked on this very carpet for years
and now was acting as if it were some
monster ready to spring at him

  chocks tightened his lips and
stepped upon the carpet watching it
closely he said

  up

  the carpet went up it rose with an
enthusiasm that threw chocks to hands
and knees midway between floor and
ceiling it hovered

  chocks swallowed his heart back to
where it belonged and turned over so
that he could sit down he began to
grin

  giddy-up he said easy now-

  the carpet circled the living room
like a soaring swallow it dipped and
curved with surety and ease it rivaled
the grace of any airplane chocks had
ever flown

  his grin grew to a broad smile bert
stevens was far from having the edge
on him yet

 whoa chocks commanded im-
periously

  the carpet settled down on the floor
again and chocks strode off the bur-
den of woes had disappeared from his
shoulders

  for tomorrow would find him in the
niles city air race   

  hocks arrived at the airport a
 half hour ahead of time he carried
the carpet under his arm and he was
whistling

  already the stands had begun to fill
and from the looks of things there


fantastic adventures

would be a capacity crowd some of the
planes were already on the line and
mechanics were busily engaged in giv-
ing final tunings to powerful motors
chocks sidled along the hangers until
he came to the hanger where his plane
was pat andrews was there waiting
for him

  hello chocks she said a pitying
look in her eyes your mechanic told
me what happened and im awful
sorry i know how much this race
meant to you

 sorry chocks asked gaily
why

  why the girl cried in astonish-
ment how can you race now that
your plane has been wrecked her
voice softened i wonder who could
have done such a nasty thing

  doesnt matter chocks said indif-
ferently ive got another plane he
touched the carpet under his arm

  youve got another plane said
pat in surprise why thats marvel-
ous where did you get it and wheres
it at

  got it from the parlor and its
right here chocks grinned at her

  here parlor a frown crept over
her pretty face but i dont under-
stand

  chocks held the carpet in front of
him this is my plane he said and
its going to win the race for me this
afternoon

  the girls mouth dropped ever so
slightly the frown on her forehead in-
creased and she looked at chocks with
the wary regard one gives to an in-
mate of the state asylums

  no im not crazy pat-im dead
serious this innocent little carpet act-
ually can fly

  pat didnt say anything she couldnt
find anything to say her eyes how-
ever plainly said that the sudden loss
of chocks chance to take part in the

air race had unbalanced him

  just then bert stevens rounded the
corner of chocks hanger he was grin-
ning

  hi folks the grin on his face
widened sorry to hear about your
plane chocks too bad too bad

  chocks lost a little of his carefree
manner he was thinking just then that
if anyone had ruined his motor it was
bert stevens

  yeah he said drily too bad
isnt it its pretty plain that the rat
who did it didnt want me to win he
must have been pretty yellow to do a
thing like that he let the words sink
in and they did stevens face turned
just the slightest tinge red then
chocks added but it wont do the
skunk any good ive got another plane
and its a damned sight faster than my
old one

  youve got another plane  
stevens frowned bewilderedly

  yep chocks drawled

  but-but wheres it at stevens
echoed puzzedly its not on the start-
ing line

  it will be said chocks and he
noticed that pat was looking at stevens
with raised eyebrows it didnt take
long for him to catch on now they
both thought he was cracked stevens
laughed and clapped chocks on the
back

  well ill be lookin for you on the
line he said his voice edged with
sarcasm and he walked off laughing

  chocks looked at pat pat looked
at chocks then she shook her head
and grasped his arm

  dont take it so hard chocks
she said you musnt let this get you
down therell be other races

  yeah after i win this one chocks
said

  the girl shrugged hopelessly and
walked away then chocks grinned
air race



after her and strode towards the
judges stand to check in  

rt here were fourteen sleek ships
on the starting line they stood in
an even line along the tarmac but
there was a noticeably empty space in
their ranks the space where chocks
plane should have been

  the race was scheduled to start in
five minutes when chocks made his
way towards the lineup a murmuring
arose from the crowd when they saw
him word had spread that he wouldnt
be able to race but there he was strid-
ing across the field with a bundle
under his arm the puzzled murmuring
of the crowd grew louder

  reaching his position chocks dropped
the bundle to the ground and swiftly
unrolled it the crowd gasped as they
saw it was a carpet chocks sat down
and peeled off his coat

  chocks knew he made a ludicrous
figure sitting in the middle of a line of
airplanes upon nothing more substan-
tial than a mass of woven wool but he
was not daunted hadnt they laughed
at the wright brothers

  chocks glanced around him pilots
were smirking in their planes and point-
ing at him in derision off to one side
there was a heated discussion going on
in the judges booth chocks knew who
they were discussing suddenly one of
them climbed down the platform and
made his way towards the line he was
a pompous little man boasting the rem-
nants of what had once been a prolific
head of hair it was horace m stevens
bert stevens father he waddled im-
portantly up to chocks

  whats the meaning of this ben-
son he demanded are you trying to
make a farce out of this race

  chocks sighed look stevens he
said managing to keep his voice even
ive paid my entry fee been granted

a position in the lineup and am in my
spot on time i dont think theres any-
thing else im supposed to do

  but good heavens man this is an
airplane race-not an arabian festival
youre not only making yourself ridi-
culous but the whole commission as
well 

  to hell with the commission
chocks said hotly get back to your
own side of the tracks if i want to
make a fool of myself thats my
business

  horace stevens glared at chocks
then shrugged and turned to waddle
back to the judging stand

  a hush settled over the grandstand
as the starter signalled contact there
was a thundering roar as fourteen pow-
erful motors burst into life wind
screamed from the backwash and flat-
tened the grass behind them the spec-
tators tensed the moment was at
hand

  there was an amused but puzzled
smile on every face as they looked at
the insignificant figure of chocks sit-
ting astride a worn little carpet in the
center of the field the starter raised
his flag and counted the seconds on
his watch

  the hum of the motors was a steady
roar then the flag flashed down

  throttles burst into life and the
planes began to move forward slowly
at first and then with gathering speed
but something suddenly shot past them

  the carpet rose with the ease of a
feather and shot ahead like a bullet
gone berserk it was a half mile in the
heavens before a single plane had left
the ground chocks chuckled chocks
laughed chocks roared he gripped
the sides of the tattered rug and yelled
in wild abandonment then he glanced
downwards

  the rest of the planes had taken the
air now and were circling for altitude


fantastic adventures

chocks could see the amazed faces of
their pilots in particular chocks noted
the incredulous look upon the face of
bert stevens he had the look of a
baby having gained possession of a
large sucker was suddenly deprived of
it then with a savagery the race was
on

  from the moment it started until the
moment it stopped the end was ap-
parent chocks flew like a bat out of
hell in any and all directions at the
same time he flew with a recklessness
that brought gasps to the throats of the
crowds below he looped and turned
and dove and twisted he cut in and
out of the other ships like a wasp on a
spree he circled above them and came
flashing down with the speed of a
comet he missed propellors by inches
and came closer to the whirling props
at every turn he would spurt ahead
with a speed that made the other ships
look like crawling insects then he
would turn and race back a mile to
repeat the performance his hair flew
wildly about him in disarray his
clothes were flattened against his body
in the savage pull of the wind he clung
to the carpet with the tenacity of a
leech

  then when there was scarcely a mile
to go he suddenly shot forward and
dove towards the finish line he landed
as lightly as a feather and rose to watch
the other ships come in bert stevens
was the first to land by a good lap
ahead of the others but chocks had
found time to light a cigarette and was
walking toward the judges stand to
collect the first prize before stevens
ship had even touched the ground

t protest thundered bert
stevens that race wasnt fair
this was supposed to be an airplane
race-there was no provision made for
flying rugs

  bedlam ensued there was a huge
crowd around the judges stand watch-
ing the heated argument that was in
progress

  i entered this race fairly and was
accepted chocks retorted and be-
sides there are no provisions in the
rules which prohibit a flying carpet
they dont even specify that entrants
must see an airplane-but just fly
why should they stevens de-
manded what else besides an airplane
would be in an air race

  i guess i showed you that chocks
answered drily and since i won i de-
mand my prize

  but you didnt win fairly stev-
ens shouted then a crafty gleam en-
tered his eyes ill race you alone in
planes then well see wholl come in
first

  chocks saw the strategy behind
stevens words he know as well as
did stevens that he would have no
chance of winning in such a race stev-
ens plane had proved its superiority
over the others it was a trap that
chocks knew he must avoid

  the judges went into consultation
horace m stevens was conspicuous in
the debate his pudgy arms waved con-
tinually and he seemed to be winning
his point suddenly he approached the
loudspeaker the crowd silenced ex-
pectantly

  the results of the race because of
their er-unusual circumstances have
given rise to the question of validity
he paused to mop his forehead he
was having a hard time finding words
then we have decided that the only
way to settle this matter is to have the
two leading contestants engage in a
separate race to decide the winner
the crowd cheered they were looking
for more thrills horace m stevens
waved his arms

  chocks benson will be given his
air race



choice of the remaining planes and
  he didnt get any further chocks
suddenly shoved him aside and ad-
dressed the crowd

  i refuse to fly any plane with bert
stevens he knows that his ship is
faster than any other on the field-he
knows he can beat me without even
trying that way i won the race today
fairly if any other race is to be run it
should be on an equal basis since the
protest has been entered against my
carpet and not me-then well let the
carpet be the deciding factor

  the crowd thundered its approval
this was just the thing crowds like to
have happen chocks roared into the
microphone

  well cut the carpet in half and each
of us will take a piece then well run
the race over and the winner will get
the prize

  a blast of approval greeted chocks
words

  bert stevens turned helplessly to his
father horace m stevens turned to
the judges

  they argued

  they argued some more

  but the crowd kept up its thunder
they knew what they wanted now and
they wouldnt give in the judges
looked at the crowd and look at horace
m stevens they decided that it was
one against a couple thousand enthu-
siastic spectators and the spectators
were the stronger the judges gave in

  chocks carried the carpet down to
the field and someone produced a pair
of scissors he cut the rug in two then
he arose and gave bert stevens one of
the halves

  stevens was pale as he took the piece
of carpet there was a bewildered look
upon his face

  h-how does the thing work he
stammered

  chicks grin widened when you

want to go up say up when you want
to go down say down the carpet will
go where you tell it to thats all there
is to it

  stevens paling mumbled something
like -up-down-up-

  the crowd was getting restless as
chocks placed his portion of carpet
on the tarmac stevens in a daze fol-
lowed suit

  chocks sat down and calmly folded
his arms beside him bert stevens was
clutching his portion with a desperate
grip stevens face was turning a deli-
cate green

ttorace t stevens was still
a remonstrating with the judges
but they since they included the mayor
of niles city a would-be mayor of
niles city and the sheriff and a
would-be sheriff of niles city remained
adamant election time was near and
they knew that if their popularity at
the polls was to be assured theyd have
to please the people

  start the race  the crowd was yell-
ing

  on with the race

  hurry up

  the judges nodded and beamed and
sat back in their seats horace m
stevens shrunk within his fat and
threw a look of despair at bert

  the starters gun was raised in the
air his eyes were glued to his stop
watch

 boom

  the rugs leaped into the air and
stevens in spite of his frenzieed clutch
upon the edges was almost torn off as
the wind gripped at him he yelped in
fear

  the crowd demanding action yelled
in derision horace m stevens moaned

  chocks circled leisurely while bert
stevens learned to manage his portion
of carpet at last the other caught the


fantastic adventures

knack and chocks deciding that from
now on stevens was on his own took
off in earnest

  he bent low on the carpet thehvind
whistling past his ears the ground be-
low him was a dim brown blur he
neared the first pylon and even as the
sight of it registered on his eyes he
was around and past it the carpet
seemed to know everything that was
supposed to be done

  as he rounded the next pylon
chocks looked back to see how bert
stevens was coming on stevens had
himself wrapped around his piece of
carpet so that little of anything of it
could be seen his eyes were closed
and his teeth wrere clicking like cas-
tenets

  chocks hovered a moment over the
grandstand and waved gaily to the yell-
ing shrieking throngs then he lined
out for the home pylon circled it and
came swooping down to earth

  it was some minutes before bert
stevens landed when he did he
crawled slowly from his rug and quiet-
ly consigned his recent lunch to the
ground

  the spectators swept all around
chocks cheering and yelling the
judges wormed their way importantly
through the crowd beaming benignant-
ly when a space had been cleared
about chocks and when the yelling had
died down sufficiently to enable them to
be heard the mayor began a nice
speech and when it was finished he
proudly presented chocks with the
 prize horace m stevens was
to have presented the prize but had
changed his mind

  chicks stammered out his thanks and
turned to look for pat she was at the
outer fringes of the crowd and the ex-
pression on her face made chocks go
warm inside he told himself that she

would be the first student at his new
flying school-after they were finally
married

  wait wait i protest bert stev-
ens had swayed to his feet and was
staggering toward chocks and the
judges

  suddenly chocks eyes narrowed as
bert stevens had stood up a small
bright object had fallen from his dis-
arranged clothing chocks recognized
it instantly for a small very expensive
part of his wrecked plane

  a river of wrath surged through him
so it was bert stevens who had de-
stroyed his plane after all and stev-
ens had shown himself to be mercenary
enough to steel that expensive metal
part besides

  chocks leaped forward and scooped
the metal object from the ground
holding it up for all to see he roared
you all know that someone
wrecked my plane to prevent me from
taking part in the race see this gad-
get it came from my plane and the
other mechanics can prove it it came
from bert stevens pocket

  the crowd eyed bert stevens and
muttered ominously the sheriff ceased
to be a judge and stepped forward to
uphold the dignity of his office he did
it with gusto considering all the votes
he would get by so doing

  bert stevens i arrest you in the
name of the law you are charged
with malicious property damage better
come with me and quietly

  go to hell bert stevens snarled
my father-

  he was standing on chocks portion
of carpet when he said that he never
completed the rest for suddenly it
leaped up into the sky in a moment
bert stevens and the rug were vanish-
ing dots

  the carpet was being obliging

lee francis is tops

 sirs

here i am again and the only way you are
going to get away from me is to stop putting such
dog-gone good stories in fa then and only then
will i stop reading fa amazing is a close
second but cant top or tie fa with me

heres how i rale the stories in the april issue
-a swell issue

	flight into fog by lee francis this is
only the third story by lee francis that i have
read but i want to say that she-or-he whoever
lee may be is super with me

	lair of the grimalkin

	coffin of life and death

	the wandering swordsmen

	the curse of ra

	the cat-snake

	who sups with the devil

the feature article on herbs was too short
there was much more that could have been cov-
ered-like using the thorn weed as a cure for
itch and many others the features are always
interesting however ill see you after i finish
reading the next issue of fa

lee francis is a he zeda and were right with
you in saying that we too think he is tops super
and in every way one fine writer along these
lines keep your eye on fa for a new novel com-
ing up by lee francis its a dilly and you wont
want to miss it as to the features you they are
somewhat short but to cover subjects like that in
full detail all at once would be something of a
problem so youll probably be seeing another
article on herbs in the future covering points
that were untouched in the first article anyway
were glad you find the features interesting read-
ing some of our readers like them almost as
i veil as the stories and well be waiting for your
next lettered

our best novel yet

sirs

  i have just finished reading lawrence chand-
lers forgotten worlds in the may fa i want
to say it is without a doubt the best novel you
have yet published in either of your two fine
books as or fa i personally rate it over the
works of howard browne-his warrior of the
dawn and nelson bonds sons of the deluge

  as you can see im a very rabid reader of your
two magazines i have issues dating back to 
   but now i have a bone to pick

  how can you rate the works of richard s
shaver with writers like nelson bond howard
browne don wilcox stanley g weinbaum
leroy yerxa eando binder frank patton and
edgar rice burroughs i cant stand his stories
no doubt all the shaver fans will demand my
blood and perhaps you will too but this is my
opinion and j have the right to express it

  this is my first letter to any magazine but

preaching to fish

	by frances yerxa 

the kwakiuti indians of british columbia
think that when a salmon is killed its soul
returns to the salmon country so they
are careful to throw the bones and waste material
back into the sea where the soul can go back
into them at the resurrection of the salmon if
they burned the bones the soul would be lost
and it would be impossible for the salmon to
arise from the dead the ottawa indians of
canada believe that souls of dead tish pass into
other bodies of fish so they never burn fish
bones for fear of offending the souls of fish and
they would not come into their nets the hurons
dont throw fish bones in the fire because the
souls of the fish would warn other fish not to
be caught because their bones would be burned
they also employ men to preach to the fish
persuading them to come and be caught a good
preacher was much in demand for they thought
that he had great power in drawing the fish
to their nets in the huron fishing village there
was an especially eloquent preacher every night
after the evening meal he had all the people
sitting silently in their places while he preached
to the fish his main text was that the hurons
would never burn fish bones he invited and
pleaded with the fish to come and be caught
and to fear nothing because they would be
serving their friends who honored them and
did not burn their bones in german new
guinea an enchanter is employed to lure the
fish to their doom he stands in a canoe on
the beach with a decorated fish basket and
crders the fish to come trom all parts of the
sea when the aino have killed a sword fish

they thank the fish for allowing them to catch
him and invite him to come again

  among the nootka indians of british columbia
it was a rule that anyone that had eaten bears
flesh must not eat fish for at least two months
they believed that fish of all kinds even though
a great distance away would come to know of it
and be so offended that they would not allow
themselves to be caught by any of the inhabi-
tants when the herring disappeared from the
sea around heligoland in  the blame was
placed on two boys who had whipped two
freshly caught herring and then flung them back
into the sea scotch fishermen believe that if
blood is spilled into the sea as a result of a
quarrel the herring will leave that port and
not return again that season west highland
fishermen believe that every shoal of herring
has its leader which it follows wherever he goes
this leader is bigger than the other fish and
if a fisherman happens to catch it he very care-
fully puts him back into the sea it would be
considered treason to destroy royal fish

  the natives of the duke of york island each
year decorate a canoe with flowers and ferns fill
it with shell money and set it adrift to compensate
the fish for their brothers who have been caught
and eaten when the tarahumares of mexico are
going to poison the waters ol a river in order to
stupifv the fish so they can be caught they first
make offerings to the master of the fish by way of
payment for the fish of which they are about to re-
lieve him the offering consist of axes knivesbeads
and blankets which are hung on a horizontal bar in
the middle of the river the master of the fish
preaching to the fish



however does not have long to enjoy these offer-
ings for the next morning the owners of articles
reclaim them and put them back into use it is
always necessary to treat the first fish caught with
much consideration in order to conciliate the rest
of the fish whose conduct may be supposed to be

influenced by the reception given to those of their
kind which were the first to be taken so the
maoris always put back into the sea the first fish
caught with a prayer that it may tempt other fish
to come and be caught

	 

the olympian muses

 	by charles recour 

the greeks have made many contributions
to our civilization the offerings they have
given our culture are immeasurable and
among the things the ancient greeks evolved
nothing is more beautiful than their system of
mythology all the peoples of the world have
given us mythological stories and beliefs but
none have stressed the aspect of beauty in them
as have the ancient greeks the ideal of grecian
life was beauty pure unadulterated beauty that
would stir man to his very core this intense love
of beauty then is reflected in the grecian stories
of their gods

  a particularly effective series of stories con-
cern the muses the muses were the nine daugh-
ters of zeus and mnemosyne they were beauti-
ful and talented and the world of the arts and
sciences was their scope everyone honored them
and wherever feasts or celebrations were held
offerings and libations were made to the muses
their function was to inspire man with the ideas
that produced his noblest thoughts in art and sci-
ence poetry and literature even today we say
that we have been inspired by the muse when
we have done something outstanding in these
fields

  calliope the most highly regarded of the muses
reigned over song and poetry she appears as a
beauty with a pencil and a slate clio the next
was the muse of history and she carried a roll
of parchment on which were inscribed the events
of the known world melpomene was the muse
of tragedy and she wears a tragic mask thalia
the comedienne carries a comic mask polyhym-
nia of the sacred hymns wears a wreath of laurel
terpsichore whom we all know as the goddess of
the dance appears playing a seven-stringed lyre
urania the goddess of astronomy carries a celes-
tial sphere euterpe goddess of harmony bears
always a flute erato the muse of love is always
depicted wearing a laurel and playing a lyre
these then were the representations of the muses

  while they were worshipped indiscriminately
by both gods and mortals alike and while their
origin was basically in beauty as in all legends
there runs through their activities the inevitable
streak of cruelty perhaps this was in contrast
regardlessly they did some unpleasant things at
times

  for example on earth there was a thracian
bard of great renown named thamyris being an
accomplished artisan he foolishly challenged the
muses to a contest of skill the muses however
were vain beyond all reason of their abilities and
that a mere human should dare to compare him-
self with them was intolerable they acceded to
the trial and as would be expected they van-
quished him not content with this they caused
his blindness and to top things off they deprived
him of his ability to sing there was vengeance
with a capital vee

  the daughters of king pierus mere mortal crea-
tures also invited the muses to a contest on
mount helicon these bold creatures fought their
battle of beauty with the nine muses but the
gods looked on enraged while these mortals
sang the skies darkened and lightning filled the
sky when the muses entered their offering
however the whole of nature became overjoyed
and even the mount writhed with ecstasy the
daughters of pierus were not to get off easily for
their audacity the muses had them changed into
singing birds as a punishment the sirens those
women whose lower extremities were formed like
birds of the sea and who had wings were also
equipped with magnificent voices with which
they lured sailors to their deaths on the rocks
in fact they were the personification of the rocks
along the seashore with this ability they too
tried to challenge the muses they made an
error not only were they soundly trounced but
they were stripped of the feathers which adorned
them

  from these various tales it can be seen that
though the greeks adorned their legendary gods
and goddesses with great beauty and with great
ability and though they believed that beauty was
an end in itself they still could not resist the in-
jection of little cruelties here and there

  nevertheless we can forgive them for that
their contributions to beauty far outweigh those
to cruelty it is impossible for a lover of nature
to walk in the woods listening to the sighing of
the wind through the trees or the rustling of a
brook without thinking-perhaps against his bet-
ter judgment-that these are really the voices of
the ancient grecian gods and that the forests are
haunted with their long-gone presence


fantastic adventures

weird sacrifice

i by june lurie 

clayton l lennings was an amateur
anthropologist and as such his word never
carried much weight with the scientific
world but his findings reported in the peruvian
journal and in a number of american newspapers
make interesting speculation lennings who is
still quite active in the field is at present back in
south america with the same firm that he worked
for before the war it is possible that he may have
something more to report

  lennings originally went to peru as the repre-
sentative of an american manufacturing firm in
 he stated that the work was not arduous
and left him free for pursuing his favorite hobby
a more than somewhat dabbling in anthropology
he visited a number of libraries and became inter-
ested in a little known tribe of head-hunting
indians the gyotos it was a trip to the interior
of peru during which he naturally left lima
that gave him his opportunity to do some real
field work

  his trip brought him to a small but productive
copper mine located in the depths of the peruvian
jungle his job was to attempt to convince the
manager of the mine to persuade his employers
to buy some floatation mining equipment to
further increase the productivity of their mine

 one evening lennings left the camp and
armed with a rifle and a flashlight he decided
to make a nocturnal jungle trip in the near
vicinity at least with the hope of perhaps con-
tacting some of the odd indian tribes the area
was rumored to possess the mining camp was
easy to locate being marked by a hundred foot
antenna with a light on top of it lennings had

no fear of getting lost he had gotten no farther
than ten or twelve miles from the camp when
he stumbled into a small clearing about three
hundred feet across he crept up to it noting
that it was occupied and appeared to be some
crude sort of an indian village there was a
central fire about which not more than thirty or
forty indians were gathered and some sort of
activity was being engaged in by a few near the
fire the remaining indians seemed to be more
spectators or worshippers than anything else
lennings got near enough to the group to see
what was going on

  a stake had been set up near the fire and to it
was tied a lovely nude young indian girl she
was firmly bound and her mouth was thoroughly
gagged so that she could make no outcry a
savagely painted priest or witch-doctor of sorts
was thrusting thorns into the skin all over her
body and her writhings apparently pleased the
indians for they were before the tableau def-
initely like worshippers later lennings admitted
how foolish he had been even thinking of doing
anything about rescuing her but he was a white
man trained in the morals of western civilization
and he had to rifle in hand he strode right
into the middle of the group and in the few words
of indian dialect that he knew he told them to
break it up and stop it

  for a moment they were all too startled to do
anything but they had had contact with white
men before and evidently knew what a rifle was
like for they did not rush him instead the
priest or chief or whatever he was barked some
rapid words to the angry indians who by now
weird sacrifice



had crept up close to lennings they did not
attack him and for his part he did no more than
menace them with the rifle without much palaver
the chief or priest reached over to the girl now
half-fainting cut her bonds removed her gag
and let her stagger out of the circle then he
simply made it understood that lenning was to
go lennings was helpless as far as doing anything
else went he could not take the girl with him
and yet he knew that she was certainly doomed if
she remained he decided to leave with mutter-
ings and imprecations the indians opened a path
for him and lennings went back to camp at
first the superintendent would hardly believe his
story but with a handful of armed men they went
back to the spot where lenning had witnessed
what he thought of as the potential sacrifice
the remains of the camp were there but all traces

of the indians had vanished even the stake had
been taken down indicating that the indians no
doubt knew that they were doing something that
was ordinarily frowned on in the best white
circles

  lennings reported the incident to authorities in
lima peru who told him that while sacrifice
was uncommon weird rites were not and that as
vet things were still in too primitive a state to
permit the authorities to properly monitor jungle
tribes trivial as the event was in retrospect
lennings says it left him with the feeling that
barbaric rites are probably practiced to a greater
degree today than anyone has any idea of other
professional explorers have confirmed this that
death was intended for the girl lennings never
doubted-it was just the method that shocked
him

 busy bees

	by cal webb 

a honeybee hive is a bustling commun-
ity where their food is stored there are
the workers drones and the queen bee
during midsummer an average hive may house
 drones  workers and one queen a
special food called royal jelly is fed the queen
bee and the more they feed her the more eggs
she lays a special crew of workers feed the queen
and help her around from one cell to another to
lay the eggs in a single day she may lay 
eggs each in a separate cell in spite of all the
help she has quite a hard day some of the work-
ers watch over the larvae which hatches from the
eggs it has to be fed before it can turn into
bees

  the cells vary in size the smaller are for larvae
that will hatch into workers the workers are
female but they seldom lay eggs if they should
the eggs would produce drones the larger cells
are made for the larvae that will turn into prin-
cesses or queens if the queen should die there
must be another one to take her place new
queens are also needed to lead off new swarms
when the hive becomes over-crowded royal jelly
is fed to the larvae that is to become queens

  most of the workers are out gathering honey
they take pollen as well as nectar from the blos-
soms being sure that they visit only one kind of
blossom in a single trip as the bees move about
from one blossom to another they lose a bit of
pollen from their wings on other blossoms this
pollenization is needed so that the plants can pro-
duce seeds that will grow the next season the
workers work so hard that they only live about
six weeks during the busy season workers born
in the fall live through the winter drones live
about four months and do nothing queens live

two or three years although some have been
known to live eight years

  there can be only one queen living peacefully
in a hive when new queens are born during the
summer the old queen may take some of the
workers and leave the hive for a new home
when there are several princesses they fight it out
to see who becomes queen it is a fight to death
sometimes the old queen is unwilling to give up
her home and is successful in holding her position
in the hive in this case the new queens take
part of the workers and seek new homes if they
refuse to leave the mother queen may kill them
she is lacking in motherly love for she is capable
of stinging her own children to death

 when honeybees swarm and leave their old
hive they must make a new home if they dont
go into a prepared hive they will go into a hol-
low limb or perhaps down an old chimney
first they have to make the honey comb from
the wax the wax comes from the bees after
they have loaded up on honey they hang from
the roof of the hive in a long string one bee
holds on to the hind legs of the one above it a
second string is started from another part of the
roof of the hive and the bee at the bottom of
that string clings to the lower bee on the first
string they hang in this v shape for a couple
days very slowly wax oozes from their abdo-
mens and they scape it all up and chew it to make
it ready to build honeycomb it takes a lot of bees
to build the comb some bring in the wax others
have to shape it into six-sided cells they begin
building from the top and add more and more
cells underneath even the most skilled men
could not do a neater job

	 
wyomings ship of death

three times a phantom vessel from the
misty void between life and death has ap-
peared on the platte river in wyoming
bearing its message of doom the strangest mys-
tery of the cattle country the story of the spec-
tral ship is related in official reports of the bureau
of psychological research at cheyenne but the
weird accounts of its uncanny appearances do not
reveal from what dim port beyond the veil it car-
ries its cargo of dread

  it was in  that the apparition first ap-
peared according to bureau records leon web-
ber a government indian scout and trail blazer
had selected a site near the river and was engaged
in building a log cabin the location in question
has been determined as six miles southeast of the
present site of the guernsey dam and near the
present station of whalan on the c b  q rail-
road

  mr webbers account follows late in the
afternoon of the twelfth of september i was get-
ting ready to return to my summer camp some
two miles down the river when glancing up the
stream i noticed what appeared to be a gigantic
ball of fog riding on the surface of the water near
the middle of the stream it was a strange sight
and in my excitement i ran down nearer the
bank in order to get a better view of whatever
it might be my dog came and sat down on the
ground behind me and began to whine and whim-
per as dogs do when there is something at hand
they do not understand when i would change
my position the dog would do likewise planting
himself directly behind me where he continued
to give vent to a peculiar sort of sound a sound
between a squeak and a whine

  as the huge ball of mist came nearer i picked
up a stone the size of an egg which i hurled at
the floating mass as the stone left my hand the
balloon-shaped cloud assumed the shape of a sail-
ing vessel of an ancient type the mast spars and
sails seemed to be sheeted with sparkling frost
or ice

  as i watched the apparition sounds appar-
ently produced by the dropping of heavy timbers
on the deck came to my ears with chilling dis-

tinctness as the sounds ceased several men in
the dress of sailors appeared upon the deck stand-
ing in a circle of close formation

  after a few moments the sailors on my side
of the circle stepped aside revealing a large square
of canvas spread upon the deck upon which lay
the corpse of a young and beautiful girl whose
wrappings were like the ship covered with hoar-
frost which glittered in the rays of the afternoon
sun

  the ship suddenly veered over to my side of
the river-and i recognized the corpse of that of
margaret stanley my best girl-friend-we were
to have been married early the following spring
margy i shouted preparing to descend to
the water

  at the sound of my voice ship and sailors
instantly vanished from view although i re-
mained upon the bank until long after sunset i
saw nothing more of the strange phenomenon
a month later i visited the stanley home and
was told of margarets death which took place
the same afternoon i beheld the spectral ship of
death upon the waters of the platte

peared to gene wilson a cattleman his report
to the cheyenne bureau is as follows

  while rounding up some stray cattle along the
platte my dog ran a few rods ahead of me and
while looking up the river began to raise a ter-
rible rumpus i was at the time some ten miles
east of casper i tried to ride my horse nearer
the bank but he had evidently seen what the
dog was barking at and try as i would he could
not be made to approach throwing the reins
over his head i dismounted when he gave a loud
snort and started to run away i caught him and
tied him to a scrub pine then approached the
bank on foot

while gazing out upon the swiftly running
water i saw something that set my nerves atingle
near the middle of the stream was a full-rigged

sailing vessel under full sail yet it did not move
at all it was held back apparently by a stern
anchor

  walking up the bank that i might be opposite
the thing i saw nine men on board who appeared
to be sailors ship sounds were heard but they
seemed to be coming from the other side of the
river and not from the ship the man whom i
took to be the captain of this strange vessel stood
with his arms folded staring toward the bow of
the ship giving orders to his men without turn-
ing his head

   stand from under came a voice from some-
where among the rigging-but the speaker was
hidden from view by the ice-covered sails as
the voice was heard the sailors on deck instantly
removed their caps and stood uncovered while
the ship suddenly veered over to a point not
thirty feet from where i was standing let down
said the captain without a sign of animation

  at the captains command a square of canvas
was lowered to the deck by four ropes attached
to its corners lying upon the canvas and cov-
ered with another piece of frost-laden sailcloth
was what i surmised to be a corpse in this my
conclusions were correct as the sheet came to
rest upon the deck one of the sailors stepped for-
ward and grasping a corner of the sheet drew it
aside disclosing the face of a woman who seemed
to be terribly burned in spite of the frightfully
scarred face i recognized my wife

  overcome with terror i screamed and cov-
ered my eyes when i looked again the ship had
vanished after a few moments i rose and
mounted my horse and with all speed returned
home to relate to my wife what i had seen top-
ping a hill a quarter of a mile west of my house
my heart stopped beating my blood froze in my
veins there in full view i discovered my home
in ashes spurring my horse to a run i was soon
beside the smoldering embers frantically calling
to my wife who i was certain was somewhere
within the hearing of my voice

  receiving no reply to my repeated calls i
hastened toward the river which ran within a
hundred yards of what had deen my home when
i came suddenly upon the remains of my wife
burned to death my supposition is that upon
discovering her clothing to be on fire she had run
toward the river bank hoping to extinguish the
flames by plunging herself into the water

nphe spectral ship last appeared on the after-
noon of november   victor heibe the
witness was chopping up a fallen tree on the river
bank near his home at bessemer bend several
months previously he had defended with his testi-
mony his friend thomas horn on trial for mur-
der in the criminal court at cheyenne but horn
had been convicted of the crime and sentenced to
hang shortly later the condemned man managed

to escape from the jail with another prisoner but
at the time of the ships appearance heibe did not
know that horn had been recaptured

  pausing in his work to light his pipe heibe
glanced up the river and noticed a huge ball of
fog apparently resting on the surface of the water
the misty mass was slowly moving down the
stream but not as fast as the current was flowing
he glanced at his watch it was exactly three-
fifteen suddenly the sounds of excited voices
came from the approaching fog-ball

  then as the ball drew nearer and grew in size
it began to assume the form of an ancient sailing
vessel under full sail but moving slowly with
every inch of its surface covered with gleaming
ice several sailors were active on the deck while
heibe watched spellbound a large sheet of canvas
was lowered in front of the sailors on the deck
and from behind the canvas voices again drifted
across the water

  all right said one voice distinctly but i am
telling you that you are hanging an innocent man
that came a second voice in reply is not
for us to determine you were tried and con-
victed for the murder and it is our duty to ferry
you across men do your duty

  by this time the vapory vessel slowly moving
inshore had reached a point about twenty feet
from shore the surface of the river being about
ten feet below the bank on which mr heibe was
standing and suddenly the sheet of canvas was
raised to its former position among the sails re-
vealing a scene of horror on the phantoms deck

  mr heibes report pictures the grim sight as
follows on the forward deck just to the rear
of the captain who faced the bow of the craft
stood a gallows of the l type from whose cross-
arms was suspended the body of a man they had
just hanged as the body swayed to and fro from
the rocking of the ship it turned so that i gazed
directly into the face it was the blackened face
of my dearest friend-he whom i had defended
with my testimony in the court at cheyenne only
a few months previously

  as heibe stumbled down the river bank shout-
ing the ship slowly and silently returned to the
middle of the stream and faded from view later
inquiry revealed that thomas horn had been
hanged in the jail yard at cheyenne on the after-
noon of the same day and perhaps it should be
added that mr heibe did not know that the
phantom vessel had appeared twice before until
he was asked by the bureau to file his own ac-
count of his weird experience

  three times the phantom ship of the platte
under full sail and coated with glittering ice has
emerged from out of the vasty deep when will
it again appear with its tale of gruesome tragedy

futile research he lost his youth immolated his
peace his reputation ruined his body and mind
and even prostituted his wife upon the altar of
alchemy and finally passed unmourned into a
paupers grave

  john dee was born in london in  and
from the very beginning showed a very keen
mind in st james college he spent about twenty
hours a day reading and when his fellow students
would always see his dim light still on at dawn
they started rumors about him he was shunned
and the word sorcery was used in connection
with his name this unbearable environment
finally was too much for him and he left cam-
bridge for louvain where he found encourage-
ment in his strange work he returned to england
when he was twenty-four and was received at
court and had a pension of one hundred crowns
he remained there for several years as an astrol-
oger till he was thrown in prison with a charge
of conspiracy and heresy against queen mary
he was accused of being a conjuror and a caller
of devils by convincing the bishop of the or-
thodoxy of his faith he was acquitted of both
charges for the next few years he had an easy
time with elizabeth on the throne his fortunes
grew elizabeth had consulted dee as to the exact
time of marys death and also about the date of
her coronation as a philosopher he enjoyed many
privileges among royalty

rvees greatest dream was to bridge the gulf
and explore the mystic borderland he be-
lieved that it might be possible for him to hold
converse with spirits and angels and to learn
through them the secrets of the universe he said
that one day when he was in deep prayer the
window of his museum glowed with a dazzling
light in the midst of which stood the angel uriel
the angel smiled graciously and gave him a crys-
tal of convex form telling him that if he wished
to communicate with beings of another sphere he
only had to gaze into it and they would appear
and tell him all the secrets of futurity

  dees experiments with the crystal were fairly
successful but he was never able to recall any of
the revelations made to him so he decided to
confide his secret to another who could look into
the crystal and talk with the spirits while dee
in the corner of the room could take notes so
he took into his confidence edward kelly the
man in the black skull cap the cap was always
worn to conceal the fact that he was without ears
he was accused of forging title deeds and was
pilloried in lancaster having both ears cut off

which was most humiliating to a philosopher
after his trial he fled to wales and there he led
an outdoor life wandering about the hills in his
long black cloak and tightly fitted skull cap with
only a bit of his features visible kelly came into
an inn in glastonbury abbey to spend the night
the innkeeper noting kellys interest in ancient
writings produced a manuscript in the old welsh
language that was concerning the transmutation of
metals it had been brought to light when the
grave of a bishop in a neighboring church had been
molested there was found the manuscript which
the violators were unable to read and two caskets
of ivory containing respectively red and white
powder which they thought were valueless kelly
bought the whole collection for a guinea and be-
lieved he had the essentials for the performance
of the magnum opus the manuscript was the
book of st dunstan who was the archbishop
of canterbury and was thought to be an alchem-
ist kelly took his treasures and went back to
london where he went in partnership with dr
dee spirits appeared to kelly and they had long
discourses which were recorded by dee as the
men were discussing the transmutation of base
metal into pure gold kelly claimed that he could
do this and as proof placed the glastonbury man-
uscript and the two caskets before the amazed dr
dee he was intrigued by the glamour qf the
story and readily financed the schemes of his
sordid-minded partner they worked years try-
ing the transmutation and claimed to have some
success as their funds were running low they
had occasion to meet a wealthy polish nobleman
count albert laski laski admired the accom-
plishments of dee and kelly who cleverly invited
him to one of their private seances kelly worked
himself up into a frenzy and then stared intently
into the crystal he prophecied to the count
that he would become the fortunate possessor of
the philosophers stone that he was going to live
for centuries and that he would rule poland
then he urged laski to take dr dee and himself
back to poland with him the scheme worked
and in no time dee and kelly and their families
were living in luxury on laskis money they set
up great laboratories and commenced operations
to turn base metal into pure gold one experiment
after another failed till even laskis purse began
to feel the strain he had mortgaged his estates
till ruination was at hand

  so in  the philosophic leeches dropped off
the poor laski and went out in search of a new
victim the two families went to bohemia where
alchemy was the main topic in prague even the
apartment in the imperial palace was fitted out
as an alchemical laboratory so you can imagine
how well the possessors of st dunstans powders
were received it was reported that kelly was
having absolute success in transmuting and that he
had performed one of these operations at the home
of the imperial physician the truth of the mat-
ter was not verified but for certain both families
fantastic facts



were pulled out of deepest poverty to great wealth
a few months later for unknown reasons they
were asked to leave bohemia within twenty-four
hours they went from one wealthy family of
nobility to another taking out of each all that
they could get it is said that they spent four
years with count rosenburg of trebona kelly
had told rosenburg that he would become king
of poland and would live five hundred years pro-
vided of course that he would supply them with
sufficient funds to carry on their experiments

vxhile they were staying with the count kelly

   and dee had many arguments dee being a
weak character would always give in kellys
wife was an ill-tempered plain looking woman
while mrs dee was very pretty kelly had for
long been attracted to dees wife so one day while
consulting the crystal kelly told dee that a naked
woman had appeared to him and told him that
they should share their wives in common dee
declared that the suggestion was made by a sat-
ellite of the evil one and refused to listen to such
instructions a quarrel took place and kelly left
his associate telling him that he would never come
back dee was now without a proper medium
and tried out many people including his eight year
old son whom he made to look into the crystal
for weeks his thoughts kept returning to kelly
whom he missed greatly after some time kelly
did return and dee felt himself blessed with good-
fortune to have a colleague who could so readily
communicate with the spirits who had failed to
appear for anyone else when kelly told him that
again the spirit had repeated the command that
they should share their two wives in common the
weak philosopher bowed to the evil spirit that in-
sisted upon such a cruel arrangement

  again the party went to prague rudolph the
emperor became so furious at kelly for not being
able to produce that he finally threw him in a
dungeon he gained his liberty by promising to
produce the stone if allowed to return to his
colleague dee then dees home was made into
a prison for kelly who worked day and night in
his futile attempts to compile the stone of the
philosophers at last he gave up in despair and
tried to escape he murdered one of his guards
but was caught and sent to the castle of zerner

  dr dee and his family set out for england
with great wealth and many coaches and servants
he had previously sent to queen elizabeth a
round piece of silver which he claimed he had
transmuted from a piece of a brass warming pan
this had the desired effect and he was invited to
return to england the queen told him that noth-
ing should stand in the way of his experiments
in alchemical research soon he had spent all
the money he had accumulated in prague but
elizabeth could not believe that he was in want
for after all he was able to make gold from baser
metal and so the only favors she gave him were
occassional audiences and her protection dee

 why be afraid of the dark

there are two reasons why we fear the
dark one is physical and the other is
spiritual there was good reason for our
primitive fathers to become frightened when
darkness came the jungle life awakened and
went forth in search of food and many feasted
on men who were frightened by the luminous
eyes peering at them through the darkness

  along with this physical fear was the spiritual
fear which was more overwhelming even to
this day the superstitious believe that ghosts
walk about at night and that the air is filled
with demons some believed that vampires
came out of their graves at night and fed on
human blood sucked from people while they were
sleeping there were many reasons why people
believed that harmful spirits were more apt to
be about at night than during the day the sun
and earth were believed to be man and wife
this couple required each other to produce living
things but each one could singly transmit power
it was believed that the sun could impregnate a
maiden and become the father of her child some-
times this was regarded as a privilege and the
saying happy the bride that the sun shines on
is a result of this belief other people were afraid
of the powers of the sun and a bridal couple
were kept under a canopy to prevent a union
between the sun and bride

  the earth was also capable of wonder-working
through its power of generation in old greek
lore there was a giant named antaeus who was
the darling of earth his all-mother whenever
he touched the ground his strength was unbe-
lievable during a wrestling match whenever he
was thrown to the ground his mother earth
renewed his vigor and he was invincible but
heracles was able to conquer him by holding him
high in the air where his mother could not reach
him and choking him to death

  canopies were also used in the case of mon-
archs who were not allowed to touch the ground
with their bare feet or have the sun shine on
their heads some countries furnished royal um-
brellas the reason for these precautions was
that at that time holiness and love were the
same and holiness was always full of danger so
if the sun or earth came in contact with a flower-
ing maiden or with a monarch there would be
dire results for all concerned the sun might die
out and the earth become barren the royalty
would become lazy and young girls would not
mature

  ghosts were believed to walk at night because
of the fact that they could not endure the light
of the sun the forces of life meant light and
death was the mysterious powers of the darkness
so the sun was blessed by man not only because
it made the land and the people on it fruitful
but because it caused the demons witches and
vampires to flee in confusion

struggled till his health failed him he tried his
crystal-gazing but did not do so well without
kelly he was finally on the verge of starvation
and applied to the queen for relief she gave him
small sums and a position as warden to the college
of manchester while dee was at manchester
kelly died in an attempted escape from his dun-
geon the death of his lifelong friend and the
persecution to which he was subjected at the col-
lege caused him to lose his mind he died penni-
less in  and was buried near his home

	 

 the little man inside

there is a new novel out today the in-
different children by andrew lee which
contains a paragraph well-worth quoting
from a psychological standpoint the passage
goes like this

       if he was ever to get to the bottom of
fact and experience if he was ever to kill the little
observer inside him that duplicated self whose
prying gaze made his every act vicarious then he
had to separate himself from generalities he had
to concentrate on the fact that the whole cant be
greater than the sum of its parts

  note that phrase the little observer inside how
many of us have been disturbed by that little
fellow nearly everyone at one time or another
has felt that inside him was or is another self
who stands aside and sort of observes the actions
of the person no matter how intensely a man
may apply himself to a task be it the courting of
a girl or the construction of a machine many
times it has been recorded in personal experi-
ence that a part of a man stands aside and notes
what is going on this may be in the form of
cynical mental observations such as what are
you doing this for or what a silly fool youre
making of yourself or is it worthwhile-what
youre doing or why are you doing this when
you know it wont be appreciated these and a
thousand similar questions may be asked by this
little invisible man in many cases this little man
operates to our detriment he may even induce a
feeling of inferiority within us a feeling which is
hard to attribute to any concrete cause the voice
whispers within us perhaps in a way this is the
origin of the legendary german doppelganger
that means literally a double-goer it is sort of
what we would call a duel personality or a
schizoid

  if this manifestation was felt only by people
who are not in good health either physically or
mentally or people whom we can not rely upon
for accurate statements we could question the
matter but this is not so every one of us has
felt the same thing to a greater or lesser degree
it is a common experience in which we all share
and the written records show such things in abun-
dance the real mystery is that the matter is not
more commonly discussed

ttow often have we heard of people hearing
voices a vast number of people have
been bothered with this weird phenomenon for
ages such people have often felt themselves ob-
sessed by a devil we may laugh at such things
but that doesnt cancel the reality of the hypo-
thetical voice to the person hearing it

  it has not always operated to the detriment of
people of course consider great leaders who have
felt it consider great artists and to a lesser ex-
tent great scientists all have been inspired at one
time or another by these intuitive voices

  this is not something to which a measuring in-
strument can be applied for it is much too subtle
for that there is no way of using a meter-stick
on mystic facts that is why so little material in
the legitimate scientific world is found of this
nature

  there is one man today who is trying to put
this mysterious activity of the human mind on a
scientific basis he is dr j b rhine of duke
university we all are familiar with his experi-
ments in extra-sensory-perccption often short-
ened to esp it is not so well known a fact
that he has also experimented to some extent
with such unusual things as we have been dis-
cussing in his way the man is a fearless scien-
tist he feels that he is on the threshold of a new
world of phenomena new in the sense that these
things have not been explored actually of course
we know that these things are as old as the re-
corded histories of mankind

  with such cold and logical and calculating
brains devoted to the mystery of why we are
influenced by little men in the mind or in-
tuition or auto-suggestion perhaps a whole
new field of scientific endeavor will be opened
many philosophers have said man knows every-
thing-excepting himself probably no truer
observation was ever made if people begin ac-
crediting the men who are willing to venture into
these little known fields of science-not mysticism
-a whole new way of living and enjoying life
will be opened to us

	 

witch hunters

many years ago in the fifteenth century
there came into being through necessity
a group of men whose profession was
to seek out people suspected of being witches and
proving their guilt mr sprenger of germany
had the distinction of being the most active man
of his profession he made up a form of trial
and also a course of examination by which his
predessors even in other countries could discover
witches sprenger alone was responsible for 
deaths each year within three months  were
killed in wurzburg  in bamberg and  in
geneva a judge in lorraine took pride in the
fact that he had condemned  the archbishop

witchcraft and burned  women at one time

  pricking was the most common mode of dis-
covering whether a person was one of satans
children the suspects were stripped naked and
pricked all over with sharp instruments the
physicians were always anxious to find a spot
that was insensible to pain for that was a certain
proof of guilt the victims would scream when
the needles were driven into them and were treated
so cruelly that death would have been welcome
as their bodies became numbed by pain and un-
consciousness and they failed to react to certain
pricking they were immediately burned as witches

  a french professor in  gives the following
symptoms as being signs that a person is be-
witched 

  	vomiting needles nails and pieces of glass

  	continual burning pains in the region of the
heart and the inability to retain food and the
feeling that balls were rising and falling in the
throat

  	suddenly becoming ill and wasting away
without any known cause

  	prescribed medicines having the opposite ef-
fect and making the disease more intense instead
of curing to such an extent were cases against
suspected witches that even an old sow and her
litter of little pigs were found guilty and put to
death

  james vi of scotland was a notorious witch-
finder the cruel ways in which he tortured the
beautiful gellie duncan and her friend dr fian
are to the discredit of james vi after the exami-
nation of dr fian by james was concluded he
could no longer be called a man his legs in his
high boots were crushed to a pulp his finger
nails had been drawn out by pincers and needles
had been thrust way through his eyes restora-
tives had been given to him time after time to
make him suffer more pain in manningtree es-
sex in the year  there came into prominence
a master witch-finder named mathew hopkins
his method of proving guilt was that of swim-
ming the suspect the right thumb of the victim
was tied to the left toe and the left thumb was
tied to the right toe and then he was wrapped
in a blanket and placed on the back in a pool if
the suspect floated as was nearly always the case
he was guilty and was burned alive but if he
sank he was innocent either way was to lose
matthew hopkins traveled in style with his assis-
tants they were put up at the best inns at the ex-
pense of the villagers and charged s per head
for each witch that they convicted another one
of hopkins ingenious ways of detecting witches
was to place a woman in a room crosslegged on a
stool she was then watched by his assistants for
twenty-four hours all during this time she was
kept without food or drink hopkins theory was
that at some time during the twenty-four hours
one of her imps would come- to suck her blood
the imp might be in the form of a fly or most any
insect and all the doors were left open it was

fantastic adventures

the duty of the assistants to kill all the insects
that appeared and if a fly should escape it was
her imp and the woman was pronounced guilty
and sentenced to burn at the stake fortunately
hopkins idea backfired and he was swum ac-
cording to his own methods and of course was
either drowned or burned

  witches were seldom hanged because it was
thought that burning was much more effective
for the blood was prevented from being hereditary
to progeny


gmotos vengeance

the slave-traders of the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries found their most fertile
source of human supplies on the west coast
of africa mercilessly they raided the gold coast
portuguese mozambique and all those western
african lands that later became huge colonies of
the major european powers

  as time went on the natives became more and
more wary and it was necessary for the slavers to
use more devious and subtle methods to enmesh
their prey often pretending to be innocent goods-
traders they would lure large numbers of natives
into their trading compounds and after surround-
ing them seize them chain them and ship them to
the americas sometimes a variation of this
technique would require a more effective spokes-
man and lure in the form of what we would call
a quizling native this native would be highly
paid to summon his friends to a position where
they could be captured by the slavers

  captain jeremy teecourser an unblushing
scoundrel and a vicious slaver of forty years stand-
ing relates an incident which even in his highly
practical eyes assumes mysterious proportions on
october   the good captain landed on the
west coast of africa where he contacted almost
immediately a renegade native from the gmoto
tribe a group of brave and courageous natives
who would ordinarily never be caught by slavers
using gallo the natives name an assistant chief
and promising him great wealth teecourser was
able to make a haul of black ivory of great size
he bagged a great number of the tribesmen
having full confidence in gallo who had been an
assistant chief for many years they were caught
flat-footed-among them was the chief gmoto
an elderly but noble man of some seventy years
teecourser took him with primarily to keep the
natives more or less pacified and to prevent them
from giving him any more trouble than was
necessary

  teecourser took his load of slaves to haiti after
paying off gallo and ordinarily the affair would
have ended then but a colleague also hunting
slaves caught up a bunch of natives among whom
was the traitor gallo gallo could do nothing
with this new man of course and he too was
shipped as a slave but more than coincidence

seems to have stepped in for he was shipped to
haiti too

  news travels fast among enslaved peoples it
was not long after gallo was working in haiti on
a plantation that his presence became known to
gmotos tribe most of whom had been sent to
the opposite end of the island the night of this
discovery in their miserable huts the tribesmen
held a voodoo meeting certainly intent on destroy-
ing the cause of their misery plans were made to
sneak one man away a young powerful warrior
whose duty was to cut gallos throat but before
he could run away gmoto stepped in

tte harangued his tribesmen long and
loudly he pointed out that the gods could
be satisfied only by gallos death through their
intervention therefore they must plead with the
gods to destroy gallo-not to do it themselves so
directly respecting gmoto they acceded and
long into the night the weird prayers and chant-
ings went on the drums beat almost silently
on the other end of the island gallo knew what
was going on-he felt it

  all through the night the invocations to the god
went on progressing from the mad voodoo dance
to the sacrifice of the chicken what a sight that
must have been in the dimly-lit smoke-filled
reeking huts fifty powerful lusty young warriors
and maidens went into their frenzied dance to the
muted beats of the drums beats that crept in the
mind not through the ears but through the oiled
black skin at the height of the orgiastic festival
when the compound was literally filled with mad-
dened beasts gmoto arose from the dias where he
reigned and with his powerful wiry fingers tore
out the throat of the writhing chicken handed him
by one of the dancers the blood gushed out over
gmoto and bathed in his enemys heart-fluid
gmoto symbolically enjoyed the death of gallo

  what happened

 for a week apparently nothing then one
morning an overseer making the usual morning
rounds stumbled into one of the huts where his
masters slaves were kept he looked down at an
inert object and then shuddered

  there law gallo his sightless eyes grinning up-
ward his face a death-mask and his throat a
bloody mass of torn flesh and gristle as if some
gigantic mouth had torn it asunder gallo had
met his fate

  there is no explanation no native would ever
admit doing it and even if he had it was almost
a physical impossibility to do anything of the sort
logicians can explain away such things very easily
but there are those even today who prefer to
think that there was the intercession of some
foreign agent captain teecourser shrewd old
yankee that he was only related the story-he
never offered any explanations and when ques-
tioned on this he gave the answer that he often
used in his diaries-there are strange
things

  white lady of death

the legendary white lady of the hollen-
zollerns is said to have appeared before
every crisis in the history of the family
during the fourteenth century the widow of a
nobleman fell in love with a hollenzollern prince
who ruled over brandenburg the prince told
her that he could never marry her because of
four eyes because she had two children she
thought that he was referring to them so she
pushed her eyes out thinking that she was remov-
ing the obstacle to their marriage after she had
done this he still did not marry her and she died
soon after the tragedy since her death she has
haunted the palaces of the hollenzollerns always
appearing as an omen of death

  during the reign of frederick the first the
queen was giving a royal ball many of the crown
heads of europe were present the queen was
playing cards with some ambassadors and the
young people were dancing when suddenly the
music stopped the young princesses came run-
ning to her pale and horrified they said that
they had looked out the window and had seen the
lady in white floating among the lilac bushes
a heavy silence settled over the gay ballroom
scene and all that could be heard was the sound
of the king hammering in his carpentry shop
he was troubled with gout and the exercise kept
him from being so stiff the sweet scent of lilacs
floated through the windows and sentries came
from different wings and gates of the palace to
report that they had seen the white lady floating
through the corridors and gardens

  after the queen recovered her composure she
ordered the music to start for the dancers and she
sat down again to play cards suddenly there
were exclamations of wonder and delight and the
queen turned and to her great surprise saw the
king coming down the corridor his eyes reflected
anger and his legs trembled even though he was
supported by two valets he came straight to the
queen and grabbed her savagely by the arm he
uttered disgust at the sight of her wearing jewelry
and enjoying earthly pleasures he commanded
all to follow him and refused to disclose his plan
no one dared to disobey and the long procession
of bejewelled ladies and gentlemen of his court
followed the royal pair through endless corridors
and staircases until they at last reached the white
salon which frederick had built and decorated
the doors were flung open and the queen cried in
horror as she saw two coffins the king explained
in his cruel sarcastic voice that he had made them
himself that very night while she revelled with the
others his sadistic mind commanded her to climb
into her coffin that he had just made for her in
order that he and all the others might see just how
she would look the queen faltered a moment as
though she might dare to disobey but then she
asked her maids to help her she lifted the hem
of her royal robe and stepped over the edge of her
coffin she stood regally for a moment and then

 lay still and calm with her eyes closed in her new
 white coffin the king looked at her with cruel
 lines marking his face in a few minutes she
 opened her eyes and looked at him and then
 climbed out of the coffin she bowed to the king
 and told him it was now his turn his courtiers
 helped him to lie down in his coffin and he re-
 marked that he would soon be sleeping there at
 that very moment the grave silence was broken
 by cries and the sound of sentries running in the
 antechamber it seems that they had seen the
 lady in white go through the whole corridor and
 enter the room where they were congregated

   they were all numbed with fear and the king
 asked if the white lady wore white gloves or
 black ones when the lady wears white gloves
 it means a woman is to die and if she wears
 black gloves it means the death of a man one
 of the aids finally broke the silence by telling the
 king that she wore black gloves he knew that
 her presence meant death for him and he asked
 to be helped from the coffin saying that he would
 be put back in it soon enough

   the next morning the king lay dying the
 white lady of death had won again

  

the corner stone

 in modern times the ceremony of laying
 the cornerstone is regarded as having only
 sentimental value and adding nothing to the
 stability of the building competent architects
 and skilled workmen insure permanence and
 strength of the structure and if the man who
 lays the cornerstone drops dead during the cere-
 mony it will have no effect on the permanence
 of the building years ago the opposite was true
 laying the cornerstone with a solemn ceremony
 sacrificing a human being was much more im-
 portant than the workmanship then the people
 believed that the soil was owned by the spirits
 and they resented having human beings deface
 their landscapes with their dwellings these spirits
 were so powerful that if they were not continu-
 ally appeased they could destroy the human race
 so the art of making the gods happy was the
 most important one of all for without their hap-
 piness all the other arts would be meaningless

   there is a danish legend that has to do with a
 curse upon the walls of copenhagen each time
 they built the walls up they fell down again
 finally the people took a sweet little girl and sat
 her on the ground with her toys while she was
 amusing herself they built the valls around her
 without this sacrifice all the skill in the world
 would have been of no help but by the offering
 of this child the gods were appeased the curse
 was lifted and the walls of the city were allowed
 to stand

   while the fort of scutari was being built a
 ghost appeared and demanded that a certain
 woman be buried alive in the foundation the
 builders thought it would be impractical to go
fantastic facts



on with their work and not heed the demand of
one in the great beyond so the sacrifice was car-
ried out

  there is a german legend that two brothers
lie entombed in the foundation of the strassburg
cathedral also a story that the wife of a fa-
mous architect who had drawn up the plans for a
certain edifice was cemented into the foundation
at the command of an archangel from heaven

  these human sacrifices were hard on the tender-
hearted people so in years to come the priests
who were representatives of the gods contented
themselves with the first fruits of the flocks or
the field

  there is a jewish legend that when the jews
were told to make bricks without adding straw
they were not able to make their quota in their
allotted time so the pharaoh commanded them
to brick up little children in the walls that should
have been filled with bricks

  fortunately a change was made from offering
human beings for instance a ram was slaugh-
tered instead of isaac and a doe in place of
iphigenia in some places in africa the shadow
of the man is believed to contain his soul so
when a hut was to be built it was the custom
for someone to sneak up to an unsuspecting person
and measure his shadow with a stick and then
throw the stick into the ground that was to be
covered by the hut of course no african would
want his shadow entombed if he could avoid it
for it would mean that his soul had been given
to the foundation gods and he couldnt expect to
live much longer but this was much better than
burying the man himself

  so from such pagan beginnings our modern
ceremony of laying the cornerstone has developed
instead of sealing a man woman or animal in
the cornerstone we seal in some documents of
historic interest so that when the building becomes
old and is torn down archaeologists may find in-
formation of our civilization

  

     the extinct tribe
     of the abipones

the abipones were a south american
tribe which wandered over the gran chaco
region they became expert horsemen and
were implacable foes of the spaniards they
made their living by hunting and were physically
well built for weapons they used the bow and
arrow lance and shield the women of the tribe
did the tattooing and the men practiced couvade
couvade was a primitive custom in which the
man of the family took to his bed when a child
was born or cared for the child or submitted
himself to fasting and purification because of
constant wars with the spaniards and also due
to their customs of killing all but two children
born to a family the tribe which once numbered
 is now extinct

the ghost of
napoleon

	by a morris 

napoleons mother was living alone in
an apartment in rome during the spring
of  although she was old blind and
nearly paralyzed she never gave up in her efforts
to help her son napoleon who was exiled on the
rock of st helena four thousand miles away she
managed to send him two priests a servant and a
cook and a corsican doctor there was a great
love between napoleon and his mother he had
always said all that i am and was i owe to my
mother she taught me her own principles and
encouraged me in the habit of work

  during his six years of exile his mother letizia
never gave up hope that some day he would return
to france it was a warm spring day in may
 and letizia sat dozing in her drawing room
her porter was also napping in the hallway down-
stairs when a harsh voice spoke to him command-
ing him to take him to la signora madre he
said he had brought news of her son the exiled
emperor at st helena the porter delivered his
message to letizia and she said to show him in at
once the stranger stepped into the room and did
not drop his enormous cloak till the door had
closed behind him when he revealed himself
letizia could see him clearly even though all else
was blurred letizia was unable to speak but her
shaking hands caressed his cheek she thought
that he had managed to escape st helena and
had come to her for shelter he stepped back
away from her and said in a solemn manner may
the fifth eighteen hundred and twenty-one-to-
day  his tone of voice paralyzed her senses and
he stepped back and vanished from her sight she
hurried to the porter in the hallway and asked
where the stranger had gone but the porter said
that he had not vet left her apartment

  on that very day on the rock of st helena in
the atlantic the birds were not singing instead it
was raining furiously napoleon lay dying on the
narrow camp bed he had used in austerlitz there
was the sickening odor of stables coming in
through the cracks of his shabby bedroom and
rats ran about among his few little keepsakes-
candlesticks from st cloud a picture of josephine
a gold watch of rivoli a silver clock from fred-
erick the great the light from a night-lamp cast
an eerie veil over the roman emperors face and
brought back the ghost of the youth letizia had
loved

  it was three months before letizia learned that
napoleon had died on may fifth eighteen twenty-
one
