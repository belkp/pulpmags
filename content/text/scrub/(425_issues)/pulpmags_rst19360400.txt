theyre unprintable the things that happen
to your system when you take a harsh quick-acting
cathartic good taste forbids a detailed description

you ought to know  for your
healths sake    what happens when
you introduce a harsh drastic laxative into
your system one that works too quickly
one that upsets you    that rushes unas-
similated food through your system - that
rips and tears its way leaving you weak
dragged down-internally abused but we
cannot tell you the graphic details here be-
cause they are too graphic this is a family
magazine not a medical textbook

   this much we can say whenever you need
a laxative be sure the one you take is cor-
rectly timed be sure it is mild and gentle
ex-lax meets these specifications

  avoid quick-acting cathartics i

ex-lax takes from  to  hours to accom-
plish its purpose it relieves constipation
without violence yet it is completely effec-
tive elimination is thorough and so close
to normal you hardly know youve taken
a laxative

  because of its gentle action ex-lax
doesnt leave you weak as harsh cathartics
do it doesnt cause stomach pains it doesnt
nauseate you and you dont need to fear
any embarrassment afterwards it is best to
take ex-lax at night when you go to bed
in the morning you will enjoy complete and
thorough relief

          a joy to take

another thing people like about ex-lax is
the fact that it is equally good for children
and adults and here is still another pleasant
thing about ex-lax  it tastes just like
delicious chocolate dont ever again offend
your palate with some bitter nasty-tasting
cathartic

get a box of ex-lax today it costs only

    whisky and women around a construction
    camp just didnt mix with good railroading

by edmund e pugsley

                  freight conductor british columbia electric railway

t took men of hickory to
 work that fourteen miles of
  grade on the big hill
 hickory clubs hickory arms
 hickory hearts

 if you had those three qualifications
-and a sober engineer at the throttle-
you stood an even chance of reaching
the bottom where the kicking horse
pass sweeps the base of mount ste-
phen with one or more of those miss-
ing-well there was always some one

like  holy hugh  whiteley to chant
 thy kingdom come  at the little
graveyard when father pat happened
to be on other service across the divide

  reports differ on the number of men
who went to glory via the big hill
route and theres many others evaded
the call by a tie width or maybe by one
of the set of switchbacks they had to
install to hurl runaway trains up a side
hill when they disdained speed limits

  for sheer fools luck the buckskin


the big hill



medal must go to eric judson-the
toughest young hogger that ever
burned iron on the kicking horse
pass

  some say it wasnt all erics fault
that he went wild like that they in-
sinuate that any other official but
whiteley wouldnt have been riding up
and down the hill looking for trouble
with a telescope any other official
would have sized up the young giant
for what he actually was-just a devil-
may-care lad with a hickory physique
but from the moment superintendent
whiteley knocked the flask of rye from
erics hand one sub-zero night while
he was holding it to the mouth of his
trapped fireman the two men were
confirmed enemies

  no liquor on this road judson
whiteley warned

  there was work to do if poor lem
kingston was to be released before
freezing to death that fact alone
saved hugh whiteley from all the
beatings his parents had denied him

wrapped in one as it was eric seized
the blustering official by the shoulder
and whirled him around his eyes glint-
ing in the pale moonlight

   dont ever do a thing like that
again mr whiteley  erics words
were pitched so low that only the help-
less fireman heard them but there-
after whiteley rode  the young engi-
neer only from a safe distance

  in its crude way the incident proved
a blessing for lem kingston that bit-
terly cold night for it seemed to stir
a strength in the judson frame for-
merly unknown-a strength that would
not be denied eric strode around the
overturned cab and set his strong legs
astraddle the victim calling hoarsely to
the others


railroad stories

   two of you git hold of lem no
you fools not that way now when
i heave pull him clear

  then he burrowed his feet to solid
bottom gripped the cab frame of the
little engine and heaved at first only
the creaking of strained wood could
be heard above the labored breathing
of eric judson those watching saw
the cords of his thick neck bulge while
a bead of sweat formed and froze on
his forehead

  then slowly the cab was seen to
raise one inch two

  lem groaned anew and squirmed
only a deep growl from the throat of
the straining giant brought the two
brakemens eyes from erics face back
to their task then they pulled on the
victim and at length freed him from
the death trap

  eric released his hold and straight-
ened his great back then he turned
and brushed aside the brakemen a
moment later he had lifted the groan-
ing fireman in his arms like a child
and was striding with him through the
snow to the warmth of the caboose

  it wasnt till they had bandaged
kingstons broken ribs and made him
as easy as possible that eric asked to
have his own right hand dressed the
hand he presented was like raw meat
burned from contact with the boiler
when the broken rail turned them over

  superintendent whiteley stood
wathing an odd light in his eyes that
might have sidetracked the feud before
it started if the other man hadnt been
so impulsive

  but when the last crude knot was
tied in his bandage eric turned to meet
the officials stare then he strode to
the little locker where refreshments
were kept lifted up a quart bottle of
whisky planted his feet wide and with
a devilish twinkle in his dark eyes

cried out  heres to our holy man
boys to holy hugh whiteley

  for a minute there was silence in
the caboose except a gurgle and swish
from the fiery liquor now disappear-
ing behind the young giants beard

  then came a scuffle of feet as white-
ley jerked open the rear door and
leaped from the car to fade into the
night down the snow-strewn way
bound for help

  the strain relaxed loud guffaws
escaped from the dumfounded train-
men and from that moment the pious
official who stood for rule g even in
emergency was known throughout the
kicking horse as holy hugh 
whiteley thus are nicknames born
on the iron road

et it be said in whiteleys favor
-that he took no advantage of that
scene of deliberate insubordination
but within the week bulletins appeared
from gleichen on the prairies to the
end of steel on the kicking horse
warning of summary discharge for the
offense of drinking whisky while on
the job of laying van hornes cana-
dian pacific steel to the west coast

  moderate drinkers softly cursed
holy hugh and engineer judson in
turn for this encroachment on per-
sonal liberty others nodded their
satisfaction and sided with whiteley

                                                                  

maybe some could take their liquor
discreetly they admitted but the big
hill was no respecter of persons who
could tell when a pint of booze might
be a pass to glory for innocent as well
as guilty

  so most of them sipped their liquor
cautiously if at all while on duty but
eric drank recklessly yet always
dame luck rode beside him warding
off disaster eluding the sharp eyes of
holy whiteley
the big hill



  the winter of  and  dragged
through with only desultory move-
ments of camp supplies in early
spring however the west came alive
from the lakes to the pacific with the
sudden bedlam of a duck march at
daybreak

  william cornelius van horne had
passed the word that the year 
should see the last spike driven on the
main line it must be the victorious
spike that would bind the scattered
provinces of canada with a three-
thousand-mile bond of steel the brit-
ish columbians had set their hopes on
this long-promised link with their
kinfolks east of the rockies and van
horne would not fail them

  fail there was no such word in
the vocabulary of william van horne
he had contracted to build a railway
to the pacific that contract must be
fulfilled

  back east in the financial markets
van horne knew the fight that his
promoters were waging pushed to
the wall were george stephen and
donald smith pushed by the subtle
tactics of enemies and doubtful friends

  already pay cars were arriving late
and rumors of rebellion in the north-
west were creeping around there was
only one way to spike these emissaries
of death-drive on to meet onderdonk
in the fraser and thompson valleys
hammer down that last spike finish
the job

  came orders from the far west that
sent cold shivers up and down the spine
of the harried keeper of the exchequer
thomas shaughnessy men five thou-
sand of them horses two or three
thousand rails-ties-spikes-dyna-
mite-food for men and feed for
horses-trains of material and sup-
plies  on with the job pacific or
perish

  all of this meant money as the three
ss knew well shaughnessy stephen
and smith millions supplies must
be paid for men must have wages

  and when they collect the wages and
relax from their long hours of toil and
danger these same men desire enter-
tainment this has been the law of
nature since the world began it is not
good for man to be alone

  the canadian pacific management
was not concerned with problems of
entertainment these were left to pri-
vate enterprise thus it came about
that a group of dance-hall girls of un-
certain age followed the steel trail with
enticing silks and perfume and ravish-
ing smiles shepherded by one queen 
helen from montreal

  helen was uncommonly beautiful
with penetrating dark eyes and a
cheery personality unlike the other
girls she did not wear gaudy attire

  with all of her charm helen was
shrewd and efficient evidently she had
a good reason for coming to a con-
struction camp some of the men sur-
mised she was drawn by love of money
eric judson guessed it was love of ad-
venture maybe it was both maybe
it was just plain love

whiteley was out on the line
to the west when the girls arrived
on a mixed train so by the time he
returned two or three days later queen
helen had her flock well established in
a big tent at the fringe of the camp

  holy hugh shot an interrogative
glance toward the white canvas and
inquired who the new citizens might
be when informed he emitted a bull-
like bellow and charged up along the
dirt trail then he ordered out an en-
gine with a couple of box cars to stand
bv for a quick trip eastward again
he strode over to the big tent


railroad stories

  reports of that brief interview be-
tween holy hugh whiteley big boss
of the kicking horse and queen
helen of the dance-hall troupe are
conflicting but this much is agreed

  the super returned almost imme-
diately and annulled the order for the
box-car extra his face was a puzzled
gray against sandy whiskers while his
eyes bore a haunted expression

  he had marched straight to the main
tent flap and snatched it open accord-
ing to the story told by eric judson
roaring two words  get out then
the queen had appeared no words
were spoken after that one peremptory
order just two pairs of eyes fixed on
each other and after that the holy
man was seen in full retreat

  rumor was rife for several weeks
but nothing definite could be learned
the lady from montreal evaded ques-
tions she remained undisturbed in
her newly appointed lair boarding up
the sides arranging the interior the
dance floor and the piano for the free-
for-all singing

  yes and taking money-always tak-
ing money from the eager lonely men
yet none could say that helen of mon-
treal was hard for no man was de-
nied admission to her big tent before
pay day nor turned away for lack of
cash so long as he conducted himself
in a reasonably sober manner

as was inevitable-with seething ac-
tivity of hundreds of men tearing
their way through rock and mud
through timber and tangled brush hur-
dling gaping canyons and boiling riv-
ers gambling with death and danger-
some were lost either temporarily or
permanently

  for the former a crude log build-
ing was fitted up as a hospital at the
kicking horse camp and to this hos-

pital came another girl from montreal
her name was jane gilmore

  miss gilmore was a nurse small and
slender with blond hair and eyes of
blue like the lady in the big tent she
was amazingly capable but in other
respects the two women were as dif-
ferent as the snow-capped mountain
peak is unlike the soft luscious green-
timbered valley

  each however served a useful pur-
pose and served it well miss gilmore
dealt in broken bodies queen helen in
hungry hearts and each thrived in
her own field

  the big hill had its attractions for
the hickory men who rode it true it
was the bottle neck to the kicking
horse and the great west beyond and
as such it bore the burden of traffic
but always there were hours of enter-
tainment in the big tent at the bottom
of the hill to compensate for the hours
they gambled with glory easing ton-
nage down with hand brakes binding
loosing and binding again against hot
wheels-a continuous chain of walking
the train top dropping off to grab the
rear and then walking ahead again

  holy hugh whiteley knew of the
attractions in the big tent of course
and furrowed his brow day and night
to frustrate them he would not rest
content till he had cleared out queen
helen and her scarlet crew

  meanwhile whenever he could find
equipment the super doubled a down
crew back up the hill again ignoring
the hours of service these men had
already given

  no organization could say him nav
no overtime clause penalize his pay
roll what was a little cruelty to a
mans body when the damnation of his
soul was at stake

  soon if his recommendations to the
general management were accepted
the big hill



these agents of satan would be driven
from the hills and his men could live
the austere lives they ought

  so eric judson and the other rail-
roaders turned their engines and
started back up the long climb cursing
the fate that had placed a stern puritan
in charge of an iron pike

trains were becoming heavier
each trip with the rapid increase
in traffic and repairs to brakes and
equipment were but a desultory busi-
ness at best protests often made to
mr whiteley got little satisfaction

   i know you fellows he said to
judson  anything to get a tie-up
down here where you can spend your
time and pay checks in that hell-hole
it costs money to hold a train down
heve while every little bolt and nut is
inspected next thing you men will
be wanting some of those new-fangled
air brakes put on the cars so you wont
have to bend your lazy backs

  eric came back at him   thats just
what well be after boss-these air
brakes-just as soon as we can get a
conference with mr van horne

   youll never get them holy
hugh retorted  why it would take
a fortune to fit all our freight cars with
such fool contraptions even then you
couldnt depend on them as for meet-
ing mr van horne if you fellows
want to lose your jobs just you go
wasting his time asking for that
eric scratched a sulphur match and
watched its blue flame slowly ignite the
wood before applying it to his pipe

   did you ever try to figure out what
it would cost if we had a real bad spill
on that there glory hill he drawled
between puffs

   no and i dont intend to said
whiteley  it just hadnt better hap-
pen thats all

  eric turned away in disgust

   if it happens at all he growled
to himself  i only hope its when
youre riding boss then maybe youll
ok them switchbacks

  soon after that the train pulled out
and headed up the hill three engines
with a drag of empties sullen eyes
of the superintendent followed them
thoughtfully till they disappeared
around the bend

  they were weary men when they
reached the divide hoping for a nights
sleep before pinching another drag
down the glory hill but life was not
like that for the crews on the end of
steel that summer there was work to
do plenty of it gaps of many miles
still remained to be closed to the west-
ward before frost and snow made van
hornes plan impossible

  instead of sleep eric judson and
 ginger  ohagan his conductor
were handed a solid train of steel rails
-the heaviest they had yet handled
down the big hill the other two en-
gines went on to meet more freight at
calgary

  it wa a cool august evening such
as only nigh altitudes know after hot
days tired though they were the crew
went about their work whistling short
snatches of airs recently heard pounded
out on the piano in helens big tent

  eric got down to help examine the
train thoroughly for defects and gin-
ger met him coming back

   i dont see what you want hand-
brakes back here for anyway jud-
son the conductor bantered  with
all that brass on your new six-
wheeler

 youll know me bucko before you
get down to glory tonight said the
hogger if you ask me weve got
just about twice the tonnage we need
ginger scowled  thats what i told


railroad stories

the dispatcher but he said it was holy
hughs orders

the stars were twinkling when
they got started and once around
the bend from summit the hickory
clubs came into steady action one
man started forward setting hand-
brakes on every other car soon the
next man followed releasing the set
brake and binding another when the
first man reached the head end he
dropped off caught the van and started
forward again with the same routine

  ginger ohagan watched casually
for a while from his crows nest wait-
ing for the real grade when he would
step down and take a turn himself

  eric kept an eagle eye behind too
he could see sparks wearing from the
shoes as they pushed around the curves
they reminded him of a set of pin-
wheel fireworks like he used to play
with on dominion day it was all very
pretty in the dark so long as those
wheels didnt get too hot

  at half way he called for all brakes
set while they stopped to cool wheels
three lanterns waved him ahed again
long before he was convinced they
should go but at last he released his
engine and with a lunge the steel-
weighted drag came down and boosted
him around the first curve again the
lanterns bobbed and the hickory clubs
jammed brakes against screaming
wheels

  they were heading into the big bend
now in a mile or so theyd make yoho
and the worst would be over

  eric peered at the track ahead a
song on his lips his fireman len
kingston now fully recovered from
injuries inflicted by the overturned en-
gine got down to heave in some cord-
wood

  they dodged through a rock cut

eric thrust out his head they seemed
to be gaining speed rapidly and the
real grade was still ahead he peered
back to see ginger ohagans lantern
coming out from the caboose and
across the arches of steel-loaded flat
cars

  he saw a brakeman fumble for a sill
step on the second car back and finally
drop off into the night the brake-
mans lantern seemed to sail through
the air and disappear apparently they
were short one man now just when
they needed all hands

  eric stood up and yanked the whistle
one long sharp warning then he
yelled across at his fireman

  grab your hickory lem were
rolling to glory any time now

  lem needed no urging he leaped
for his club and scrambled back over
the cordwood tender

  no more time was spent in releasing
brakes it was set them hard-all of
them-as light as hickory muscle and
hickory club could set them against
rolling iron-and leave them set hot
wheels or no hot wheels

  there was no choice now the grim
reaper was waiting for them down
around the bend waiting with that ter-
rible grin which so many railroaders
have seen for a brief memorable mo-
ment

  according to ginger ohagans ver-
sion of it the devil himself had slipped
aboard that night at half way with
a whole flock of little red imps  for
iviry blissed brake beam in the infer-
nal drag so what could mere man
do with a load like that every
wheel was a whirlin hoop of red-hot
hell when we hit that yoho bend he
testified

  the valley of the kicking horse
roared with the din of a million dem-
ons during those few minutes till half
the big hill



a thousand tons of steel plunged over
into the gulch below yoho pulling
erics new brass-trimmed engine over
with it

  neither eric nor his fireman were
aboard at the time for they like gin-
ger ohagan had elected to desert the
narrow confines of the rail for the
wide open spaces up there where a
gravel fill gave them a gamblers chance
against old glory

  the brakeman missed the gravel

down in the camp at kicking
horse they heard the din the
chatter and music at helens place was
hushed talk in lone cabins ceased as
if by magic men and women stepped
out into the cool summer night to lis-
ten staring at each other while strong
faces blanched and scalps crinkled

  holy hugh heard it also when fi-
nally the awful crash climaxed the
thunder of wheels and the night was
hushed again he shook himself and
roared hoarsely for a crew

  up the hill they went the little re-
lief train with only a freight caboose
and two cars of general outfit for help

  the camp doctor was down the river
attending a call beyond the end of steel
where a powder man had permitted his
discretion to relax father pat had
gone along with him but nurse gil-
more prim and capable came from the
tiny hospital hugging an armful of
first-aid equipment

  just as the mercy train was about to
start there appeared another woman
queen helen she too carried a bun-
dle and moved toward the caboose step
with an appealing gesture holy hugh
standing fretfully while waiting for a
reply from the dispatcher at summit
saw the newcomer and waved her
coldly back

   no he barked

 but i can help the poor boys
helen pleaded  if theyre still alive
 no i said the superintendent re-
peated sternly  we have a nurse go
back-to your den of iniquity

  he swung up the step and reached
down for a message the operator was
passing helen ran to the front end of
the caboose and tossed up her bundle
to the platform

  whiteley was waving a signal to go
ahead the engine snorted loudly and
moved away but those remaining on
the platform distinctly heard the voice
of queen helen raised in prophetic
tone

   some day hugh whiteley youll
be glad of my help

  neither the queen nor holy hugh
knew just how soon that prophesy was
to be fulfilled

t y the flicker of lanterns they gath-
ered the crew of the steel train up
along the line-one here another there
a third yet farther along it was slow
work and painful with only the oil
headlight to show the rails and nothing
beyond

  more so was it slow in the case of
finding the brakeman-whose light had
gone out in more ways than one the
brakeman made no sound to call them
to him over his mangled body they
spread one of the sheets from the bun-
dle which helen had tossed aboard
and then bent their energies to relieve
the suffering of those still alive

  when they found eric judson leg
shattered ribs fractured and body a
mass of bruises holy hugh bent close
to his face and sniffed keenly of erics
labored breathing

  the engineer stifled a groan and
muttered  too bad boss you cant
charge it up to whisky this time how
about those switchbacks now


railroad stories

  holy hugh stood up and signalled
for a stretcher without waiting to
help he went on to the others lem
kingston got off with a broken arm
while ginger ohagan escaped frac-
tures but exposed a tattered shirt and
a body of torn skin and bruises

  the super pious and energetic was
not interested in bruises just now
once within range of gingers cursing
breath he jerked out his notebook and
made grim notations he had found
what he wanted

  conductor ohagans services were
summarily dispensed with the follow-
ing day and another accident was
charged up to the demon alcohol

  meanwhile in the caboose the deft
hands of jane gilmore had set and
bandaged erics injuries suddenly
he caught a glance from the nurses
eyes and there he kept his gaze until
she felt it and flushed from that
moment the soul of eric judson was
entirely at the feet of the blonde from
montreal

  eric was like that women had
never meant much in his impulsive
strenuous life he had met but few
of them and most of these in queen
helens place but their type didnt
appeal to his nature they treated all
men alike so long as the price was
forthcoming and they drank liquor
eric didnt like women who drank

  but this other girl this nurse was
quite different so down at the camp
hospital with little else to do but look
about him while his wounds were heal-
ing eric fixed his attention on the
graceful form and sweet face of jane
gilmore

  by the time he could leave his bed
the hogger knew from her lips that
superintendent whiteley rated him a
hard drinker and that she jane gil-
more disapproved of whisky that

the patient assured her was soon rem-
edied hed climb aboard the water
wagon it was a piomise

  jane smiled at his impulsiveness
then blushed at the reason thereafter
tric judson lay dreaming of a cabin
in the rockies which he would build
perhaps here in the kicking horse
perhaps further on next year when steel
stretched through to the fraser and
always in that cabin waiting for him
when he slid down from bis engine at
the end of his run was the golden-
haired jane

  the days passed swiftly for eric
after that the boys came to see him
and to talk of the progress of steel to
the west they spoke of van horne
storming up and down the line de-
manding more and more action of
holy hugh and his apparent deter-
mination to take revenge on all men
involved in the steel-train runaway and
on all men discovered drinking on
duty of the delayed pay car and
gossip about the road going broke

  the visitors surreptitiously brought
red-eye for the patient and stared in
amazement at his refusal

   never again boys eric declared
and he seemed to mean it

   so holy hugh has got you buf-
faloed eric they laughed

  the hoggers eyes softened as they
swept across the wide room to fasten
on the white-capped nurse

   no he drawled quietly  holy
jane gilmore

  they left him soon after that star-
ing oddly at each other judson they
decided had been injured elsewhere
than in his leg too bad a man like
eric

the frosts came early that year
snow powdered the high ground
in late september the pass grew
the big hill



steadily busier until it seemed they
could never handle all the traffic

  holy hughs worries too grew
with the increasing freight moving to-
ward end of steel the little camp at
the base of mount stephen was a
young city of seething activity a rail-
way yard as well as a clearing house
for graders of all nationalities queen
helens canvas palace thrived as only
such places can thrive in a construction
boom

  eric was walking with a cane now
and hoping to get back on his engine
soon runners were scarce besides
he needed the money if his plans
worked out

  the patient was limbering his leg
with a brisk walk one evening at dark
when he met the call boy

   seen anything of kingston the
lad inquired

  eric hadnt but he knew where lem
would be so long as he had a dime
the caller was new or hed have
known too so he sent him up the trail
to the big top where all the music was

  five minutes later eric met the boy
hurrying back alone and asked  get
him 

   no kingston wont come
  what did he say

  say retorted the youth just
about everything there was to say i
reckon

  eric grinned that would be lem
all right  what are you going to do
about it-call another man

   nope there aint no more i
gotta go tell mr whiteley

  the boghead checked the caller with
the crook of his cane  dont do that
listen come on back with me i
know him better than you do

  at helens place lem greeted his
comrade boisterously and proffered a
drink  no glory hill for me to-

night eric  have a drink-and to hell
with holy hugh

  eric waved the glass aside  dont
be a damn fool lem youre going
out tonight they need you theres
no one to take your place

   no said the fireman  gonna
stay right here at queen helens
cant be beat eric have a drink

   youll get fired if you dont come
along his friend warned

  the queen came to add her argu-
ment to erics  better go to work
tonight lem come back again later
no work no pay you know she
smiled her pretty teeth sparkled and
the black eyes flashed alluringly
 come on be a good boy

  lem stared until this seeped through
then he nodded  thass right
queenie youre always right bring
another bottle

   not now eric protested  youve
had enough for tonight lets go

   no you take a drink lem urged
 im not drinking the hogger said
crisply  and you know it

  youre what cackled the fire-
man  yuh wont drink with me since
you sit with that nurse gal helens
gals aint good enough for you any
more heh

  the queen ignored this insult eric-
scowled but held his temper at length
he ventured

   listen lem ill have one drink if
you promise to come along to work
what say

   sure eric sure get him a glass
helen great old boy eric is none
better

  the drinks came eric swallowed
one as he had promised then he took
the fireman by an arm and led him out
of the tent the call boy joined them
outside

  they were a strange trio as they


railroad stories

lurched down the trail eric shuffling
stiffly one hand on his cane and then
at the bend in the trail it happened
they met head-on jane gilmore out
for an evening stroll the nurse sprang
back  with a gasp of surprise and dis-
appointment

  oh eric she exclaimed then
she did a queer unladylike thing she
turned and ran

  in a weird daze the big hoghead got
lem to his engine and waited till he
was safely at work then he headed
back to the hospital jane was there
busy and met him coldly he told her
the truth of his visit to helens with-
holding only the drink he took

  she turned uncertainty in her
glance to study him he pressed closer
then she caught the fumes of his
breath that lone drink at the big tent
fury and scorn swept across the girls
face

   so you lied to me mr judson
she accused  youve been drinking
again i might have known it

   but i- eric began

 well i dont mind she cut in
 i dont care if i never see you again
once more jane gilmore ran from
him and slammed the door of her room
behind her

  eric went out then striding savagely
along toward the station there he met
holy hugh

   how long do you expect to lay
around judson the super asked
pointedly  you look all right to me
eric said   is my engine ready
holy hugh gulped  no not ex-
actly tonight but i like your spirit
you can go west to end of steel in the
morning

   ill go eric snapped

  he wheeled around to limp away
but he didnl return to the hospital
nor to his bunkhouse for bitter

words were still ringing in his ears
 i dont care if i never see you again

eric didnt show up for his engine
west that next morning nor did
he the following morning finally on
the third afternoon he came roaring
drunken defiance at holy hugh and
the superintendent a light of unholy
glee in his eyes delivered the verdict
youre fired judson ive been
waiting for this chance these many
days get off the railroad

  eric glared at the somber-faced offi-
cial a small group of trainmen gath-
ered to listen in

   go on you whisky soak do you
hear me holy hugh thundered
 get off the railroad go back to your
jezebel and her den

  eric stalked forward to thrust a fist
under the puritans nose  you talk-
ing about miss gilmore mister

   whiteley backed off  no you
fool im talking about that-that per-
son over there  he pointed a shaking
hand toward the tent which flaunted
its white canvas to the skies  thats
where you belong go back there i say
and tell the woman of sin that i sent
you

  eric dropped his fist uncertainly and
lurched away holy hugh watched a
moment then flung after him 

  and as for that nurse-you keep
your drunken self away from her en-
tirely understand judson

  erics stupor seemed to leave him
cold he whirled about and stamped
back again shaking his huge fist under
the nose of the superintendent

   that goes for both of us white-
ley he threatened  if i ever hear
of you touching a hair of that girls
head ill come back to camp and tear
you apart do you get that

  holy hugh did not reply he didnt
the big hill



need to his face betrayed quite clear-
ly that he understood

when the mixed train started up
the big hill next morning for
points east it had two passengers a
man and a woman they were eric
judson and queen helen

  the woman had been informed of a
new tariff on liquor that would spell
finis to her place she knew where to
lay the blame for this and now she
was heading east to have it counter-
manded in a satchel at her feet helen
carried a large sum of money for de-
posit in the bank at calgary

  idly eric noted men scattered about
the station and yards as he waited for
the train to start more men than he
had ever seen before and they were
still coming

  he caught snatches of talk about the
pay car he noticed a sign calling for
a meeting that morning here and
there groups of men talked loudly and
profanely berating mr van horne
and george stephen also donald
smith and holy hugh whiteley
whenever whiteleys name was men-
tioned they glared across the tracks to
the window marked  superintendent

  but eric was too melancholy to
bother with such things he had called
at the hospital for his clothes had se-
cured them laundered and wrapped
without so much as a glimpse at his
former nurse

  he had come away with heavy feet
and sad heart not noticing a shadow
behind the curtain nor hearing the lit-
tle sob as his train gathered speed-
the train carrying helen of montreal
and eric judson

  it was at banff fifty-five miles to the
east that rumors of a riot stirred erics
interest an excited group was hud-
dled about the station door as the train

arrived at dusk lem kingston was
there firing now for  red  bisbee
eric plucked lems arm to ask the
cause

   its that mob of graders at the
camp said lein  theyre wdld be-
cause the pay car dont come an
barney just wired through for the
mounties for theyre fixin to take it
out on holy hugh

  eric snorted  might be a good
thing for the railroad if they did he
answered  but that wont bring the
pay car wheres it at now anyway 
 dont rightly know the fire-
man shook his head  some say it
aint started yet an theres a lot o
talk about the road goin broke again
i cant believe it myself but-well
whats the delay if they got the
money 

  eric shrugged  search me maybe
its the grand trunk pulling political
strings or something a lot those fat
boys care about us out here or about
this country either still it dont affect
me any more lem

   too bad eric an too bad if they
shut the pike down too so many peo-
ple dependin on her now

   you dont think its as bad as
that eric wanted to know

  just then a shout came from the
station door the two comrades
crowded to hear the news

   barney says they smashed in holy
hughs office but they missed him
someone was announcing excitedly
 he slipped over to hide in the hos-
pital theyve found a keg of helens
booze in the freight shed an busted
it open therell be murder done down
there before they quit an the pay car
out of winnipeg too just too late
a hand was pinching erics arm
he turned but seemed not to see the
girl at his elbow


railroad stories

  just like the white-livered coyote
to sneak into the hospital muttered
the big engineer  hiding behind a
ladys skirts poor little jane

   eric the woman was begging at
his arm  what is it  whats happen-
ing at camp

  he stared at her and gave a rasping
laugh that made other men turn-men
who had heard that laugh before when
things were happening

   its my old friend holy hugh
the hogger drawled  hes meeting his
maker tonight but the skunks trying
to drag jane along with him-do you
hear that helen

  he squeezed her arm till she squealed
with pain

   what do you mean  demafuled
the queen  tell me quick

  he told her while she clung to him
clutching at his sleeve for support
then suddenly she jerked alive again

    eric we must go back and save
hugh-and jane gilmore do you
hear me eric

  he chuckled insanely  you and
me against a hundred and fifty men
helen all drunk with your whisky
a hundred and fifty savages after holy
hugh whiteley hooray

  his face was hard and set the
queen eyed him curiously

   we can do it eric she said
 listen theyre after money-their
pay aint they well well go down
and pay them

   sure he cried pulling a ragged
dollar bill from his pocket  with
this how much you got to go with it
sweetie

   ive got just fifteen thousand in
that satchel she responded seriously
 thats a hundred dollars each it
ought to satisfy them till the pay car
comes dont you think

   you-youve what

   fifteen thousand helen repeated
tensely  i was taking it to the bank
at calgary

   and youd do that-hand out all
that money to save the worthless skin
of a man like whiteley why he
wouldnt even pay you back

  she nodded avoiding his eyes  ill
take that chance eric-if youll help
me

  there came a shout from the office
then and the hogger replied  the
wires down west of summit the
mobs started their dirty work sure
as shootin

  eric the boss of the big tent
was pounding his chest now  youve
got to help think of that girl with
him in the hospital jane gilmore
why she and i used to go to school
together back home in montreal
think of all my poor girls too
theres no telling what that gang will
do when theyre drunk please
eric 

  he nodded vigorously at last pushed
her roughly from him and lunged for
the station office

  to the agent there he commanded
 get me the road boyle pm going
down to camp

  he was gone again striding along
the platform for the  the only lo-
comotive within fifty miles-the one
coupled to the head end of the mixed
train

  he snatched up the pin behind the
tender and leaped to the deck a mo-
ment later the started engine was bark-
ing up to the passing track switch

  queen helen was there waiting with
her satchel eric checked speed and
leaned down the ladder to sweep her
from her feet as he passed

  men gaped at the tableau not realiz-
ing its import till the engine had again
passed out to the main line and was
the big hill



roaring away backward toward sum-
mit with a third person climbing up
over the pilot lem kingston

  only then did the agent come alive
and wire his dispatcher the news that
a crazy crew had captured the  and
was heading west under full steam
running backward

   theyre hell bent for glory hill
and camp right now and theyve got
that helen woman in the cab so youd
better give them a clear board for you
know eric judson

crawling into the cab lem
kingston swayed to the engineers
side  youre craziern a loon but i
bad to comfe he yelled  what about
wood 

   youre the tallowpot now eric
barked  give us steam never mind
the wood

  he snapped open the last notch of
the throttle and sent the sturdy little
-- thundering up the long easy
grade then he left the window long
enough to guide his female passenger
to the seat behind him at the window
stowing her satchel beneath

  it was forty miles and a seven-hun-
dred-foot climb to summit lem
tossed fuel sparingly into the firebox
once he pulled a flask from his pocket
and passed it to eric the engineer
took it and snapped out the cork but
before it reached his mouth a soft hand
had pulled it away

  me turned around to face helen
the woman had her arm out the win-
dows pointing ahead she made no at-
tempt to speak but something in her
dark eyes told him what she meant
men were running amuck dowrn at the
foot of the big hill tonight-all with
whisky-clogged brains

  eric snatched the flask from her
other hand and flipped it away

  lem stared in bewilderment then
went back to his wood pile and pres-
ently as he was tossing the last stick
of cordwood into the firebox eric
whistled shortly but sharply for sum-
mit-and whistled through

  the fireman peered out the window
in time to catch a little blur of lights
then summit dropped behind there
was nothing ahead but the big hill
and maybe the camp at its base or
maybe-glory

  lem staggered to the other side he
shouted  now  know youre crazy
were all outa wood an w-ater too

  eric drew in his head from the rush-
ing black wind he flung back
 whatcha want that stuff for now 
never yet knew an engine to stall run-
ning dowrn hill

   but the air pump idiot groaned
the fireman  how yah gonna work
that without steam how yuh gonna
stop when yuh get there 

  jack weaved a huge hand to the other
side  go sit and rest wrell stop all
right-some place never knew it to
fail

  with lips that muttered unheard
words lem finally obeyed what else
could he do-except perhaps leap into
the cold night well it was too late
now to do even that with safety

  erics head went out again the 
rolled on rocking and lurching madly
once he turned to the woman at his
back

   you all right he yelled

  again he got his answer it was a
hand out the window pointing ahead
and dow-n-down into the dark where
they were going where anything might
be happening

   some dame he muttered  and
that coyote called her a-a jessie bell
whatever that is tf hes still alive ill
make him eat those words and by


railroad stories

god if jane is hurt ill finish the job
for those savages with my own hands

  the cab lurched around a curve and
straightened out again leaping ahead
with bullet speed lem gripped his win-
dow desperately

  roll on chariot sang eric jud-
son  roll on

there are many stories told of the
big hill of men who merely
glimpsed its shores to come back and
relate the experience but eric made
the ride that set a record for all time-
a ride into the very gates of kingdom
come and out again with a woman
jezebel aboard

  a whisky-crazed mob heard him
down there even above the tumult
they paused from the business of bat-
tering in the stout door of the log hos-
pital and listened they waited for the
crash as they might wait for an hourly
charge of dynamite up in the pass

  but the crash was not heard as they
expected the thing whatever it was
came on and on so they waited and
listened and wondered

  eric judson straining eyes out
across the tender put his hand at last
to the air-brake valve to check their
speed he had watched and nursed that
air holding it for the last supreme
effort not a pound could be wasted
very soon the time would come

  it came almost too suddenly the
speeding comet straightened out on that
last long stretch while eric was still
seeking a landmark in the blur of dark-
ness and leaping black objects he
snapped on the brake with all he had
and gripped it hard to wait results
they came swifter than he desired

  a drunken grader had flopped a stub
switch leading back into a gravel spur
the tender struck it and sailed through
the air the drivers followed and

all in a moment the sturdy  had
buckled on her side

  eric at first sign of going threw
back his arm for helen of montreal
they went over together he gathered
himself up dazed and bleeding from a
gash in his cheek to find that the
queens foot was caught beneath the
cab frame he tried to free her she
screamed a little and called out

  the satchel eric get it and run
you may be in time yet

  he looked down at her there he saw
the unnatural twist to her foot knew it
was broken but she only called
run save whiteley

  lem came then from where he had
doubled himself into a ball nd rolled
down the bank

   get help and lift her out eric or-
dered and instantly he was off with
the satchel dangling at the end of one
of his long arms in the satchel was
salvation money for holy hugh-from
his jezebel

  the hospital door went down as
erics pile-driver blows cleared a way
to the front of the mob torches
lighted the weird scene the engineer
ripped open the satchel and raised a
bundle of bank notes to wave it before
their bleary eyes

  money men money he
screamed  do you see it money
the pay car

  those in front saw it and paused in
sudden fascination

   money eric yelled again  the
pay car i tell you

they passed the word back and
again pushed forward  pay pay
eric thrust the money back into the
satchel and tossed it through the
broken door

  stand back if you want it he
commanded  go get your pay checks
line up at the station 
the big hill



mobs are queer that way they
had come to smash and to take
a human victim as sacrifice to a fancied
injustice but here was something else
again here was money and wasnt
that what they wanted after all  sure
it was their pay

  so they cheered and jostled and
wormed their way back toward the
station fumbling in their pockets for
mislaid time checks

  as eric watched them melt away a
hoarse voice intoned  in the name of
our redeemer judson where did you
drop from with all that money did
the pay car really come 

  eric turned a cold face to pale hugh
whiteley

   yes he said it came-for you
take it get over there and pay your
men before they start again for by
heaven i wont stop them again

   but who sent it judson

   who thundered the engineer
 you ask that ill tell you who it
was your-your jessie bell or what-
ever you called her thats who it
was

   what whats that gasped the
super  you dont mean-helen

    do i mean just that

  holy hugh was taken aback  she-
she did that for me

   for you yes sneered eric  i
dont know why

  the official haggard of face gripped
erics arm helen is my zuife jud-
son he confessed  i turned her out
because-i thought she did me wrong
but i was wrong-and then i found
her here-

  eric twisted the groveling pitiful
man around with a hickory grip  go
tell her that shes yonder under the
engine-and all because of you if you
want your woman go get her now
holy hugh was gone then with a
staggering lope moaning queer words
as he ran toward the railway yard in
the wake of the mob

  the hoghead was still staring after
him when another voice-a soft gentle
voice-spoke at his elbow

   that was good advice eric

  he whirled to look down at jane gil-
more crazy thoughts were tumbling
about in his crazy young brain

   which advice  he murmured

   the advice you gave mr white-
ley said the blonde from montreal
if you want your woman-

  eric seized her hands both of them
and looked into a pair of blue eyes
which suddenly reflected for him all the
mystery of life-the thrills of railroad-
ing-and the glory of the big hill

                           author of  the great strike of  etc

arch th  will mark
the hundredth anniversary
of the express service of
america on that date honor
will be paid to the memory
of william frederick hamden who is
sometimes called the patron saint of the
railway express agency

  bill harnden began his career as pas-
senger brakeman and then conductor on
the boston  worcester railroad just
about the time that road was opened and
later became a ticket agent for the b  w
in boston he held the boston job for
about three years and then he grew rest-
less that was in  when bill was
twenty-seven years old he yearned to do
big things before he was too old

   i want to make my mark in the world
he confided to his friend james w hale
a newsdealer and a steamboat agent

  hale had a bright idea  why dont
you run errands between new york and
boston he replied  carry small pieces
of valuable freight that people dont like
to trust to steamboat baggage men

  the idea appealed to bill instantly
equipping himself with a modest carpet
bag he approached bankers brokers busi-
ness men of all kinds and volunteered to
undertake confidential missions particu-
larly the carrying of valuable letters pack-
ages of greenbacks jewelry heirlooms that
hitherto had been entrusted to hale and
other steamboat agents there was urgent
need for such service in those days

  bills record with the boston  worces-
ter railroad had been good he pointed
out that for years he had been handling
the companys money first in the capacity
of trainman then as ticket agent his
record and his personal appearance inspired
confidence gradually bill found himself
building up a new business

  on the rd of february  the bos

ton newspapers carried an advertisement
stating that w f harnden had made ar-
rangements with the providence railroad
and the new york steamboat companies
 to run a car through from boston to new
york and vice versa four times a week
it stated furthermore that mr harnden
himself would accompany that car  for the
purpose of purchasing goods collecting
draughts notes and bills

  this service was inaugurated on the th
of march it was very well received even
the conservative boston transcript an-
nounced on march th  that mr
harndens express was  highly convenient
to those who wish to send small packages
from one city to the other it affords us
much pleasure to recommend the express to
the notice of our readers

  the word  express  in those days had
a somewhat different meaning from mfiat
it has now it meant a man caring
letters or packages nowadays he would be
called a messenger

  this notice in the transcript gave bill
some conception of the value of getting on
the right side of the newspapers he con-
tacted with the editors of the daily papers
in new york and boston to carry the latest
news between those two cities the tran-
script duly announced on may th  we
are indebted to our friend harnden of the
package express for the united states
gazette philadelphia of yesterday

  thus bill harnden gradually acquired
more business than his modest carpet bag
could possibly hold and he branched out
hiring several helpers including his brother
adolphus

  the following year-on the th of feb-
ruary-adolphus perished in the loss of the
steamboat lexington together with 
other passengers and members of the crew
when that vessel was burned to the waters
edge off the coast of long island only


railroad

stories

four persons were saved the loss included
fifty thousand dollars in currency as well as
other valuables which adolphus was trans-
porting for some of his brothers customers

  it was a terrible blow for bill harnden
but he continued to carry on the business
with very little success and finally died at
the early age of thirty-one on jan th
 he was a worn-out man but one
who had unknown to himself sown the
seeds for the mighty railway express
agency of today

in  the year of the steamboat lex-
ington disaster a young man named
alvin adams after failing in the grocery
business followed in the footsteps of bill
harnden by starting an express company in
partnership with one p b burke burke
soon dropped out but adams persisted and
in  be was the proud possessor of a
horse thus originated the famous adams
express company

  meanwhile in  the american ex-
press company was launched when henry
wells who had been bill hamdens agent
at albany n y and george pomeroy
formed a business partnership for express
service between buffalo and albany-a
journey of four days and three nights by
railroad steamboat and stage coach

  pomeroy soon lost interest in this enter-
prise-the journeys were long and rigorous
while the pay was small-but wells kept
at it and in  he organized with wil-
liam g fargo and others a concern that
was to become famous under the name of
wells fargo  company among the
others may be mentioned d n barney
who later became president of the company
and who was at one time president of the
northern pacific railroad

  wells fargo  company immediately
began to cut rates in  it cost seventy-
five cents a pound to ship freight from new
york to the west coast the new company
promptly cut it to forty cents business
boomed the company prospered other
companies arose and most of them did
pretty well then came the merchants

 which set out to monopolize
the industry after going into the red to
the tune of  in the short space of
two years the merchants union was
thrown into bankruptcy and was taken over
by the american express company with
william g fargo as president

  wells fargo  company in the firt five
years of its existence carried fifty-eight
million dollars worth of gold dust into san
francisco in the days when the west was
wild and lawless and highway men knew
where to get the big money the express
company which also carried on a banking
business and ran stage coach lines picked
its men well-the kind of men who are
glorified today in song and story-and
armed them with revolvers and shotguns
to fight off the bandits

  many a wells fargo  company agent
was shot to death out on  the lone
prair-ee  or in the treacherous mountain
canyons or in a baggage car on the railroad
and many a road man took the long trail
where all the pony tracks point one way
but the great express business went on

  in i wells fargo  company ab-
sorbed the glamorous pony express service
of william h russell and b f ficklin
but soon relinquished it due to the comple-
tion of the first transcontinental telegraph

  finally after numerous amalgamations
the express companies founded by the
pioneers of yesterday were welded into the
great railway express agency of today
which has national headquarters at 
park avenue new york city and its own
monthly magazine the express messenger

  the humble carpet bag with which bill
harnden started this vast industry ninety-
seven years ago has been preserved to this
day and a costly monument has been
erected over bills grave in mount auburn
cemetery boston but bill harnden
doesnt need a stone monument his last-
ing glory is the roar of countless thousands
of wheels and the whir of airplane wings
which carry a nations freight over land and
sea at a speed far beyond the wildest
dreams of the former passenger conductor
on the boston  worcester railroad

              sangre del salvadors
rise from the high desert
floor of the llanos pin-
tado like a wavy purple
barrier on a flaming car-
pet far to the east of del rosa ser-
rated rims trace their hazy outlines
against the horizon

   of these one deep slash stands out
 between towering peaks like the
 notched v of a gun sight clearly
 defined the eye finds it a full seventy
 miles distant they call it canyon
 pass

  a mighty gorge with bold ram-
the angel of canyon pass



parts hewn when the world was in the
making canyon pass has been shackled
by steel but never fully conquered
ceaseless warfare is forever waged
there many pages in the history of
the pacific coast  transcontinentals
canyon division are today written in
red grim entries in the ledger of life

  stories of canyon pass have been
told and retold wherever railroad men
gather in sandhouse and switch
shanty and dispatchers office in engine
cab and caboose even in those stiff
sanctuaries where heavy-jowled brass
hats sit on their mahogany thrones

  of these tales one has become leg-
end it concerns bill carnegan and
 the angel of canyon pass

  just over the hump in the sangre
del salvadors are six miles of track
that railroad men consider the most
dangerous on the division long ago
the p c  t built a shanty at mile-
post  on a little flat an eighth of
a mile east of the trestle over big
stormy canyon and stationed a track-
walker there

  a tiny hut far from the nearest
habitation and surrounded by jagged
peaks it was almost a place of exile
men called that job  the sheepherders
trick

  now and then the section boss and
his mexican crew from paraje had
work to do in the vicinity at inter-
vals a freight stopped to leave sup-
plies occasionally wandering in-
dians broke the monotony sometimes
folks waved from observation plat-
forms of speeding trains or there was
a shout and a hand raised in salute
from eab or caboose perhaps a late
paper came fluttering off or a maga-
zine

  always there were frowsy head
and thunder mountain scowling
down from their lofty heights

   	r

as though debating what particular
kind of hell they would hurl next at

canyon pass

bill carnegan was big clean-
cut and fine-looking superinten-
dent mccuen eyed the man speculative-
ly something stamped hint as a rail-
roader mccuen judged him to be
about thirty-two

  well what is it there was
scant encouragement in the flat hard
tone

  bill said a hint of desperation in
his voice  im looking for a job -
he hesitated- any kind

   jobs are scarce mccuen an-
nounced briefly  what can you do
 i-i was an engineer

  the super shook his head  we got
a list as long as your arm of men set
back firing

   i know said bill despondently
 ive tried every roundhouse between
here and trinidad but ive got to get
something cant you fit me in any-
where wages dont matter just as
long as there is enough for my wife
and me to get by on

   so youre married eh

  bill nodded  we had to come
west for her health i had rights on
the central valley back in new eng-
land she had a bad attack of flu and
her lungs are affected

   kind of tough wasnt it - quit-
ting back there when you had senior-
ity

  the other smiled his eyes lighting
 not for me he said  anything
i could do for her wouldnt be half
enough anns the finest woman in the
world it was mighty hard for her
to leave friends and relatives and mie
home we fixed up

  humph mccuen stared out of
the window and far away toward that


railroad stories

purple line of the sangre del salvadors
and the v-shaped cleft of canyon
pass at length he asked

   whats your name 

   carnegan bill carnegan

   well carnegan theres just one
job i know of the super drummed
on his desk   doubt if that job would
interest you a mex had it last and
he went cuckoo

   what is it  the hogger inquired
with instant hope so often he had
carried back to ann a discouraging
 nothing doing today sweetheart
but tomorrow ill find something
there had been a lot of tomorrows

 track-walker mccuen said
gruffly  out on the hump after a
pause he added  men dont stay in
canyon pass long the solitude gets
inside of their skulls and they do
queer tricks

   but i wouldnt be alone bill has-
tened to point out

   you mean youd take your wife
 sure i couldnt leave her here
where i go ann goes mountain air
is just what she needs to help her get
well and it wont be forever things
will be picking up after awhile then
ill get something better

   how long you been married car-
negan 

   eight years

  mccuens eyes softened under
shaggy brows he stroked his chin
thoughtfully here was a big husky
fellow from engine service stepping
down from the cab to walk the ties-
and offering no complaint

  the superintendents mouth twitched
a little such devotion to a woman
was something to think about in this
cock-eyed age he wrote a brief note
and handed it to bill

   take this to the roadmaster-mr
godett the last office at the end of

the corridor i guess hell fix you up

  and so bill carnegan went to can-
yon pass bill and ann

it was spring the mountains were
cool traces of snow lingered in
the deeper clefts of the high peaks
they made a wild unfriendly world
those sangre del salvadors it took
ann carnegan a long time to get used
to their untamed majesty

  the ever-changing vistas - dawns
that poured gold over the high rims-
flaming sunsets-the quickly descend-
ing curtain of night-the blasting
winds that poured eternally through
the pass-all filled the woman with awe
and consternation

  the vastness of this bold raw coun-
try was a far cry from the friendly
life that had been hers back there on
elm street in old new england

  though she fought it with all her
might ann was terribly homesick but
she never let bill know nights when
the dread wind trumpeted through the
canyons her pillow would be wet with
tears and then when morning came
she would be ashamed

  life and health were here after all
she could do no less than match the
gallantry deed for deed of the man
who had given up much for her and
so bill saw only a brave smiling face

  never once did the man hint of his
own tragedy but ann sensed the hun-
ger that haunted his eyes when the
trains went roaring by she knew
that bill missed sitting at the throttle
with drivers pounding under him by
comparison it was a dull existence
this walking the ties with a wrrench and
a maul

  and yet canyon division had never
had a track-walker as faithful and un-
tiring as bill carnegan it seemed
having been at the throttle himself he
the angel of canyon pass



realized the importance of his task
the sangre del salvadors were filled
with constant menace slides falling
rocks washouts-all went to make the
place a railroad mans nightmare

  summer came the season of tor-
rential rains and when frowsy
head and thunder mountain wore
trailing veils of black they gave omi-
nous hint of cloudbursts the big
stormy dry at other times would be-
come a swollen torrent rolling down
boulders and debris

  bill was anxious about the trestle
over the canyon and when thunder-
storms sounded their booming war
drums at night he would dress take
his lantern and go out to make sure
that all was well at the gorge

  and always when he returned
chilled and wet ann would be up and
have a fire going and a pot of coffee
on that light gleaming in the win-
dow stirred strange emotions in his
heart he would slip an arm around
anns waist saying  youre a grand
sweetheart and kiss her

   i have to be shed answer  to
keep up with you bill

crews reported to del rosa that
carnegans lantern was always
there to greet them when the weather
was bad its twinkling assurance lifted
the burden of responsibility for those
whose business it was to see that the
trains went through safely mccuen
and godett spoke of it more than once

  too the men on the trains came to
watch for the slender form of the
woman in the door of the little shanty
at milepost  she was as much a
part of canyon pass as carnegan him-
self

  and when the section foremans
wife was sick ann went to the sec-
tion house at paraje to be of such

service as she could when a freight
went off the iron in the narrows ann
attended to the injuries of the fireman
and a brakeman and made coffee for
the crew while they waited for the
wrecker

  now and then a hungry bo was fed
or the coat of a mexican gandy
dancer was patched or they were ex-
pecting a new arrival at pedros house
and ann would make a baby dress so
they began to call her the angel of
canyon pass

  the young lady from new england
found plenty to occupy her time and
busy hands helped her forget from
a shanty beside the tracks she lent her
magic touch to the making of a home
curtains framed the windows a
flower garden took shape stones were
set in a neat border and whitewashed
the garden was bright and vivid for
ann loved gay colors-especially red

  the section boss and his men always
had a little spare time for landscaping
when they were in the vicinity and it
was a good excuse to visit the friendly
mrs carnegan

  vines climbed the drab sides of the
little yellow building a red rose un-
folded its petals on a bit of trellis ger-
aniums added color there were holly-
hocks and wild verbenas passengers
on the trains looked from pullman
windows and marvelled that a work-
mans hut could be so lovely

  the general superintendent said it
only showed what could be done and
advocated that stations along the line
follow the example set for them bv
the track-walker and his wife in can-
yon pass

  mccuen coming in from a tour of
inspection spoke to roadmaster
godett suggesting that a small addi-
tion to the one-room structure at mile-
post  would add materially to the


railroad stories

comfort and convenience of the car-
negans

  that bridge gang at wagon tire
are tearing down a couple of shanties
said the roadmaster  theres the ma-
terial and weve got a work train go-
ing to rag river the first of the week
it wouldnt be much of a job and mrs
carnegan ought to have a kitchen
youre damn right mccuen
agreed  why that shack out there
attracts more attention now than the
scenery they tell me that half the
women on the trains complain because
they cant stop and look at that gar-
den and maybe get some slips

one day an old indian named
maggie came to milepost 
she had been gathering pinon nuts in
the vicinity and decided to visit the
white mans home as a possible new
trade outlet

  it was anns first woman visitor
and she could have offered no warmer
welcome to a neighbor dropping in for
a call back on elm street

  maggie said  how 

  and ann proud of a little spanish
taught her by the mexican section
hands replied como esta

  the squaw knew mex and her stolid
face brightened  me maggie she
said  indian name na-va-wi

   me ann i call you na-va-wi i
am so glad you called

  and the lady from new england
served lunch just as she would have
done for a visitor at home

  old maggie dug down into a pocket
of her voluminous skirt and produced
a number of desert stones-tourma-
lines agates and bits of brightly
colored petrified wood anns eyes
sparkled she loved these jewels of
the wasteland

  she bought two or three stones and

asked maggie to come again later she
sent to del rosa and amargosa for
gay pieces of calico and other articles
that she felt might find favor with the
indian squaw it was lots of fun sit-
ting out there on the stoop and bar-
tering with maggie

  ann carnegans health improved
there was a healing tonic in the rari-
fied air of these desolate mountains
slowly she was rebuilding - winning
her fight to live

  a great weight lifted from bills
heart he went whistling about his
work life was good after all a
track-walkers job was better than the
best run in the world-so long as he
just had ann

  too the roadmaster had hinted there
was a better position in store for him
ann had heard a great deal about the
old indian pueblo at nunez where
maggie lived in time circumstances
made it possible for her to visit it
when she returned to canyon pass she
was enthusiastic about the bit of
ancient world she had seen it had
been like turning back the pages of an
old book she told bill

  for a long interval maggie did not
come to canyon pass and ann missed
her one of the mexican section hands
finally told her that the trader at
paraje said the indian squaw was sick
so ann went to nunez taking along
such homely remedies as were at hand
together with presents for maggies
grandchildren

  she rode in a caboose to paraje and
from there was driven to nunez in a
shaky flivver owned by one of the sec-
tion men she stayed away from home
several days

  when mrs carnegan took her de-
parture old maggie now on the road
to recovery said   you bueno good 
padre say great white father got um
the angel of canyon pass



heap fine angel show picture you
angel na-va-wi never forget

  and old maggie never did

in june of the second summer that
bill carnegan and ann had been
in canyon pass tragedy laid its dread
finger on milepost 

  ann caught cold she told bill it
didnt amount to anything just a case
of sniffles but suddenly it settled on
her chest that night there were
chills and fever bill flagged a west-
bound freight and sent for a doctor
the doctor came from del rosa the
next morning on no  a nurse was
with him

  they fought valiantly to save her
but it just wasnt in the cards for ann
to live the patient died two days
later her hand in bills

  she smiled up into his face and
whispered  good-by bill it-its
all - been so wonderful - with
you  

  the former hoghead was never the
same again after that first stunning
tearing blow had eased a little he
faced things with a strange vacant fix-
edness that made men shake their
heads

  they spoke awkwardly of sorrow
of sympathy while bui stared at them
with eyes that looked beyond toward
that far horizon and a woman smiling
at him through the mists

  they asked carnegan where he
wanted ann buried-in the cemetery
at del rosa or back east

  superintendent mccuen was there
and roadmaster godett and the sec-
tion boss and others they awaited
his answer grave troubled they saw
here a man under strain moving as
one who walked in his sleep where
did he want her buried

  the lines that creased his face sof-

tened at last  why bury her here
he said slowly as though there could
be no other course  i want her close
because ill be keeping watch in the
pass

  mccuen grizzled railroad veteran
found a lump in his throat godett
fumbled for his handkerchief and blew
his nose the section boss swore un-
der his breath

  the husband wanted her buried
here hardened men of the high des-
ert looked from one to the other

   out there on that knoll across the
canyon bill was saying  where she
can see her garden and look down to
the foothills   

  thus they laid poor ann carnegan
to rest at milepost  just west of the
big stormy

  the section men erected a wooden
cross and bordered the mound with
white stones from anns garden and
bill set out a red rose her favorite
color

  the first thing that enginemen on
eastbound trains saw as they rounded
the long curve at the summit of the
sangre del salvadors was that white
cross on mrs carnegans grave

  the angel of canyon pass no
longer waved from the little house
down the track but the train crews
somehow felt that she was still there-
watching for them more than one
veteran of the throttle lifted his hand
in solemn salute as his engine pounded
past

  bill continued to walk his beat to
milepost no-out and back each day
he cared for the garden and smoked
his pipe on the stoop in the evening
with the stars looking down

  when thunderstorms crashed off
frowsy head at night bill followed
his usual procedure he dressed took
his lantern and walked to the trestle
ao

railroad stories

over the big stormy to be sure that all
was well before going out he would
light the lamp he liked to see the
yellow glow of it when he returned
and would tell himself that surely ann
was there waiting for him

old maggie came to canyon pass
again one day she brought a
beautiful piece of polished chalcedony
the wrinkled old squaw had in truth
stolen it from the curio store at paraje
she could have sold it to tourists but
maggie had not taken the agate for
profit but for love she put it on the
angels grave

  then there was the bottle dyed a
rich purple by long exposure to the
sun that bill discovered at the foot
of the cross ann had been very fond
of glass thus colored also in the
course of time a cluster of sparkling
rock crystals found their way to that
mound of earth

  and there was a round piece of
grained ruby glass snuggling in the
dirt-a safety reflector lost from some
car or truck down on the highway old
maggie had remembered that ann was
fond of red

  one day bill saw the indian gather-
ing pinon nuts down beyond the nar-
rows and he called to her

   you still bring ann pretty stones
he said  gracias mucho gracias
 na-va-wi love white sister the
squaw replied  she good woman
she good to old maggie she wake
up from long sleep some time see
presents indian bring

   yes god bless you maggie she
will know shes watching all the
time a tender smile lighted bills
face  i can feel her close-walking
with me

  a few days afterward bill came
home late clouds were gathering

around thunder mountain and frowsy
head black veils threw their long
streamers over the higher peaks of the
sangre del salvadors

  all afternoon squalls had been
snarling far off on the desert rim
with lightning playing on the horizon
at half a dozen points distant thun-
der had kept up an almost constant
grumble

  the former hogger prepared and ate
his supper then sat for a time on the
stoop in the fading light he walked
up the track and across the trestle and
on to that bit of raised ground where
the grave was he never missed a
night he knelt beside the cross and
breathed a prayer

  then he lingered for a little tender-
ly rearranging the stones of the bor-
der smoothing the earth the rose
bill had put there was unfolding a
blossom a beautiful bud that had
opened to smile at him

  each of the presents that old mag-
gie had brought he picked up wiped
off carefully and returned to their
places

  a freight came roaring over the
summit from the west the whistle
moaned under the easy drag of the
engineer at the cord the fireman and
brakeman both crossed the cab to look
from the gangway bill waved at
them

  faces in the cab of the pusher and
in the caboose saw the track-walker
and men shook their heads a strange
picture here in the dusk-a lonely fig-
ure a grave a cross

a storm was centering around
frowsy head the lightning was
sharp and frequent thunder boomed
through the mountains with jarring
reverberations a large proportion of
the run-off from the eastern watershed
the angel of canyon pass



of frowsy head spilled into the big
stormy

  a new storm moved up from the
south toward thunder mountain bill
stood in the door of the shanty watch-
ing it looked bad

  thunder mountain and jawbone
dumped water from their rocky slopes
into the narrows there was always
danger of slides and falling boulders

  bill donned oilskins and boots
 guess id better go down to the nar-
rows he told himself

  he lighted the lamp on the table
near the window anns picture was
near the lamp it showed her waving
her hand and smiling

  the track-walker took his lantern
and went out on the threshold he
pause to look back his eye went to
every familiar object that she had
touched-and again to the picture

   good-by ann he said  ill be
back in a little while

  he went out to the trestle over the
big stormy there was very little
water in the canyon it seemed that
the storm had moved over to the west-
ern slope of the divide there back of
frowsy head

  bill started down the track toward
the narrows it had begun to rain as
he reached milepost  a squall
was coming off jawbone

  no  the crack westbound limited
came doubleheading up the grade from
paraje her two big mountain type
locomotives roared full throated in the
night rain slanted across the head-
light of the first engine in gusty sheets
gray rivulets spewed from the rocky
slopes

  the flicker of a lantern near mile-
post  announced that carnegan
keeper of the pass was guarding the
rail

  two brief whistle blasts cracked the

salute of no  blurred faces in the
cabs looked down and muffled voices
shouted greetings at him bill yelled
and waved his lantern

  he started back he had gone per-
haps a mile when he detected a new
note menacing the night he stopped
for a minute to listen then went on
with a quickened pace

  he had felt so sure that all danger
was past there at the big stormy but
now a grim premonition laid hold of
him a quarter of a mile farther on
he paused again

  faintly a dull roar came to his ears
above the noise of wind and rain it
was an ominous sound he had heard
it before it was not unlike the rum-
ble of an approaching freight train
drifting down the grade

  bill broke into a run a cloudburst
was coming down big stormy canyon
frequent squalls had softened the ap-
proaches to the trestle only the day
before some section men had worked
there filling in those little gullies cut
by coursing rivulets it wasnt the
structure itself for which trackmen
felt concern but those fills behind the
concrete abutments

  the rain was slackening now and
yet the thunder of tumbling water
grew louder there were too the
crash and grind of trees and boulders
against cut-bank canyon walls gouging
brittle earth as the increasing accumu-
lation of debris was hurled along in
the teeth of the mounting flood

 somewhere sodden clouds had
emptied themselves high in the moun-
tains-the last mad caprice of the
storm even now stars were peeping
through around frowsy head

when at last he neared the big
stormy bill was close to ex-
haustion he had long since dis-


railroad stories

carded his cumbersome raincoat and
boots his feet were cut and bruised
from the rock ballast

  he glanced at the light in the win-
dow of his home as he stumbled on
past the little building beside the track
it seemed to give him renewed
strength he felt that ann was dose
beside him

  as bill approached the trestle he
was met by muddy water it was com-
ing down the right-of-way ditches
creeping over the ties a wide sweep
of it spread before him a veritable
river flowing gurgling about the steel-
work

  minutes were precious every sec-
ond that ticked away was a step toward
eternity if no  were on time she
was already getting close not a month
before the schedule to chicago had
been cut two hours while newspaper
and magazine advertisements boasted
of this new fast service

  water poured across the rails like a
mill-race its power was terrific  it
ciutched at his legs with devilish feroc-
ity trying to drag him down a foot
dropped between the unseen ties al-
ready the earth was crumbling the
fill had started to go

  bill pitched forward something in
his leg snapped blinding pain
stabbed him he felt himself being
swept away he caught at the sub-
merged rail now a foot beneath the
coursing flood the lantern and a
fusee he had gripped in his left hand
were lost

  death held no dread for bill car-
negan life offered little since ann
had gone and yet tonight a grim
determination filled his heart it was
not himself of whom he thought but
the railroad and the men and women
whose lives he guarded

  he was going to cross the big

stormy in spite of hell and high water
a fighting irish heart carried him
forward foot by foot

  smashed and buffeted by muddy
water that tried to drag him down
stream bill struggled on ever in his
ears sounded the roar of the torrent

  his right leg dragged uselessly he
advanced on hands and knees a tree
came floating down the gorge its torn
roots writhing flailing like the menac-
ing arms of an octupus the trunk
swung toward him in the gloom he
sought to get clear but a jagged limb
stub struck him on the head opening
an ugly gash

  in desperation bill wedged his knee
against the guard rail and clung there
for a little gasping he fought dizzi-
ness almost utter exhaustion then
once more he crawled refusing to sur-
render

  gone were lantern and fusee every
last match had long been soaked past
all usefulness even if the former
hoghead could reach that west bank
of the big stormy and solid ground
he had no means of attracting the at-
tention of the engineer at the throttle
of no  theyd never see him in time

  and yet in the brain of bill car-
negan there burned one spark that
would not die in his ears above the
din of waters he thought he heard the
low sweet voice of the girl hed wooed
and won back in old new england

  now he was going to keep a ren-
dezvous with her - there by that
mound and the cross ahead some-
thing carried him on something that
lifted him across those last flood-torn
rail-lengths to solid ground across the
big stormy

number  was on time two
engines over the sangre del sal-
vadors and fourteen all-steel cars -

the angel of canyon pass



maii express and pullmans crazy
creek canyon reverberated to the stac-
cato bark of the exhausts and the
drumming of steel on steel

  light rain was falling the fringe of
the storm that had swung toward
thunder mountain earlier charley
donaldson a veteran runner of the
canyon division was at the throttle
he had been watching the lightning
flashes out ahead

   they been getting hell in canyon
pass he called to the fireman

  the latter ceased his labor on the
deck for a little and stood beside the
engineer

   anyhow it aint like the old days
he said  when there was a wooden
trestle over the big stormy and the
alex track-walker was more likely than
not pounding his ear in the shanty

   thats right my boy the hogger
responded fervently  carnegan is
out there now looking after the track
when we bat em over the hump and
start rolling down the mountain we
know that everythings ok

 it was mighty tough carnegan
losing his wife the way he did
donaldson sighed  it sure was
 you know charley that grave
kind of gives a man a funny feeling
dont it you 

   why i dunno i sort of think of
mrs carnegan as being there beside
the track donaldson said  just
watching over things

  the fireman agreed  yeah thats
right bill and her my god it must
be awful lonesome for him

  no  swung at last over the high
rim of the sangre del salvadors
lights shone from the windows warm
inviting life on the train flickered
past with cinema-like rapidity a few
travelers lingered in the dining cars
men and women lounged at ease in

   	r

club car and observation porters
were busy making up the berths an
old man dozed in a section a gray-
haired woman beside him a mother
smiled down into a babys face a
honeymoon couple sat holding hands
their heads close

  charley donaldson leaned across the
padded arm-rest his keen eyes squint-
ing past the glass vveather-wing along
the track ahead two emerald dots
hung like a pendant against a black
velvet curtain

  he turned his head toward the left
and sang out green eye

  and the fireman called back   green
on the block

  a stubby granite post whipped past
milepost  the beat of the ex-
hausts had quickened to a hurried mut-
ter drivers and side-rods were but a
crashing blur fast-rolling wheels
were checking off the miles with a
singsong clickety-click that measured
the rail-lengths as one counts heart-
beats

  heavy cars cradled with gentle un-
dulations that indicated smooth swift
flight no  was right on the adver-
tised speed the watchword

the big passenger haulers heeled
to the curve west of mijepost 
the silver beam of the electric head-
light washed the steep slope to the
right of the track in swift review

  juniper and pinon sprang out of the
raven blackness crouching shadows of
boulder and gully sharp-drawn stria-
tions in a red bank hewn by erosion

  on swept the far-reaching finger
like a spotlight hunting for figures on
a darkened stage and then for just
an instant it seemed to pause as
though that which it sought had been
found

  a gently swelling knoll back some-


railroad stories

what from the right-of-way with a
softening background of pinon there
was a cross in that dim distance like
a tiny ornament hung on the swelling
bosom of the mountain gleaming
white

  charley donaldson never failed to
watch for it as his train swept over
the rim of the sangre del salvadors
his eyes were on it now in narrowed
focus suddenly he became rigidly
intent

  there was something moving close
beside the mound it was uncanny
the distance was yet too great to vision
detail

  then came a sudden flash of red-
a dull-glowing crimson eye it moved
back and forth the gleam of the
headlight swept on around the curve
and it was lost

  cold fingers clutched at the engi-
neers heart the thing was weird
spectral

  the hogger lost not one instant in
making his decision he closed the
throttle and snapped one short blast
from the whistle signaling the second
engine to shut off then his fingers
closed over the shiny brass handle of
the et equipment he swung it full
to the right the big hole

  it would take emergency air to stop
them charley donaldson sensed that
if anything had gone wrong here in
canyon pass it was at the big
stormy rain had been pouring hard
out on the divide there was always
the possibility of a cloudburst

  the engineer answered the strange
smouldering eye of red with two quick
blasts

bills heart swelled almost to the
bursting point as he heard the
acknowledgment they had seen his
signal no  was stopping

  the track-walker forgot the agony
of his tortured body as he saw that
parade of fire-rimmed wheels on the
curve his soul soared to undreamed-
of heights he gasped a prayer of
thanksgiving

  the angel indeed had walked with
him tonight her spirit buoying him up
carrying him on when it seemed that
the best he gave would not be enough
she was here with him now

  bill slumped onto the grave  ann
he choked  my own dear sweetheart
through the power and the glory-and
you-we have saved a trainload of
people

  the fireman peering ahead yelled
 its a washout theres hell to pay
in the big stormy

   my god look at it awe was in
donaldsons voice  the flood has cut
around both abutments

  his headlight revealed the devasta-
tion of the foaming torrent the big
engines of no  ranged on past a lit-
tle then with a last buckling surge
the train came to a stop not a hundred
yards from the big stormy and its
murky death trap

  charley donaldson lighted his torch
and swung hurriedly down the roar
of mad water in his ears a miracle
had saved them - a miracle and bill
carnegan

  moisture that was not rain trickled
down the hoggers seamed cheeks as
he walked back and his flaring torch
revealed the figure of carnegan
slumped down beside the cross

  others came stumbling toward the
spot - engineer and fireman on the
helper uniformed trainmen men to
whom the booming roar in the black-
ness meant that they had been riding
into the valley of eternal shadow

  the waving tongue from donald-
sons smoky torch laid its yellow illu-
the angel of canyon pass



mination over the scene faces were
white strained as the group of vet-
erans of the rail found themselves wit-
nessing a scene that would linger in
their minds on through the years

 carnegan that was the name
framed by their lips carnegan here
beside the grave of the wife he had
loved so much

  charley donaldson handed his torch
to his fireman and dropped down to
slip his strong arm about carnegans
shoulder

   what happened bill 

  the track-walker told them he
spoke with effort slow-worded
phrases that told of the storm and the
sudden onslaught that had trapped him
there to the east of the big stormy
he made small mention of his desper-
ate fight against the turbulent waters of
the flood

   i lost my lantern and fusee he
said  but i knew i had one chance
long ago old maggie the indian
woman who came so often to see ann
brought this-

  he still clutched in his hand the
ruby-grained safety reflector and he
held it out

   this piece of red glass he went
on  and those other things there

treasures they were tokens of love
god bless her faithful old heart it
wasnt much this piece of glass but
maggie knew that ann loved red so
she put it there -i-well i figured
youd see the red charley he looked
at the engineer

  donaldson slowly shook his head
 i did clear as a bell there was a
catch in his voice  i couldnt have
missed it

the canyon division wanted to
erect a memorial-the canyon
division and the passengers who were
on no  that night and so a beauti-
ful white shaft was placed where the
cross had been on it was put a
bronze tablet with the name carnegan
in bold letters as a tribute for all to
read to a railroad man and his wife

  and thus they remain today eternal-
ly on guard in the high rims of the
sangre del salvadors-bill carnegan
and the angel of canyon pass

the northwestern pacific r r whose -

original northwestern pacific ry the san fran-

the california northwestern the original north-
western pacific ry was incorporated in  and
it included the old north pacific coast running
from sausalito to pt reyes and cazadero most
of which has been abandoned

  operating  miles of line at present the nwp
has been owned entirely since q by the south-
ern pacific which that year acquired the  of
its stock owned by the santa fe the road had
hard sledding even in good years and it suffered
greatly during the depression in  for ex-
ample its operating income was  but

 of this sum had to go into operating costs
which left a deficit of more than a million after
all charges by  operating income plunged to
 but it rose to  in  and
gained a little over that last year for the last
five years there have been small operating deficits
and of course comparatively large deficits after
all charges

  in addition to the locomotives listed below the
road owns  freight  passenger and 
miscellaneous cars and in  it employed 
people to whom it paid

indebted to d s richter  sixth ave san

street-car thrills

by george beater

any readers have asked for
odd and thrilling incidents
about street-car operation
here are a few of them
gathered mostly from my
own experiences as a boomer wandering
around here and there for instance in
mexico city i recall the time a certain
trolley wire broke near my home one
end hung down in the middle of the track
a foot or so from the ground there were
eight cars on this route and it was interest-
ing to see how each crew got their car past
the break

  every one of those eight conductors used
a different method one conductor held
the wire clear with a broom while his car
coasted by another gingerly looped his
handkerchief around the wire and held it
clear a third removed one of the cane
seats from the car stood on it and held
the wire clear with his bare hands

  the fourth wrapped a newspaper around
the wire and held it clear the fifth backed
his car to chopo street and proceeded on

another route to detour around the break
the sixth stopped a rubber-tired carriage
that was passing and stood upon it while
he held the wire clear the seventh used a
cane seat to insulate his feet and his coat
to insulate his hands while he held the wire
clear the last crew backed their car to
the nearest suitable switch and returned
about five minutes later on the other track

  the switchman at chopo street co-
operated with the car crews by pulling the
trolley pole down when the car coasted by
the break but he refused to have anything
to do with holding the wire clear

  when the first car to encounter the
break returned on its next trip the crew
was armed with a length of rope with
which they tied the wire clear in typical
mexican fashion it was hours and hours
before a service gang got on the job to re-
pair the break

  speaking of slow progress street-car
funerals were quite common and popular
in mexico city when i lived there the
car company had nicely decorated open-

coffin and other cars to convey the
mourners

          	 

the following item was contributed by
robert white pontiac mich first
successful electric car line with overhead
power was built by f j sprague and put
into actual operation in richmond va in
 other electric lines had been built
prior to that time but they do not appear
to have been successful therefore first
electric-car honors should go to the union
passenger railway co now called the
virginia electric  power co which is still
in operation the first car no  left
the car shed at th and p streets rich-
mond on january   and reached the
western terminus one-half hour later
those cars were small with a capacity of
from thirty to forty and they were barely
able to negotiate the steep grades this
twelve-mile pike attracted attention and
was liberally patronized as it is today

  a model of no  was built by walter
d eubank the conductor who collected
the first nickel fare on that car the
model is much like the original cars ex-
cept that the trolley poles at first were

made of wood the last heard of this
model it was in possession of eubanks
widow who lives near richmond va she
is not interested in selling or displaying it

  the virginia electric  power co has
no record of what became of the original
no  she was probably scrapped for
years this company has been trying to
ascertain the name of the museum said to
be in n y city in which the first nickel
taken as fare was deposited for display
perhaps some reader can supply this in-
formation in  the company was
given the charles a coffin award  for dis-
tinguished contribution of the development
of electric transportation for the con-
venience of the public and benefit of the
industry

         	 

the pittsburgh street car system is
more like a real railroad than any
other street car system i have ever seen
on account of the hilly country almost
every line has its own private right-of-way
along part of its route some have private
rights-of-way along their entire route ex-
cept right downtown	

  the lines that dont follow city streets
are draped around hillsides through cuts

over fills over many bridges some of them
hundreds of feet long and a hundred feet
high and even tunnels one of them three-
quarters of a mile long through which six-
teen lines operate

  south hills junction is at the south end
of this tunnel and it looks as much like a
railroad junction as anything ive ever
seen a square two-story signal tower
stands at the mouth of the tunnel where
the various lines diverge back of this is
the red brick station with superintendents
office crews register room dispatchers
office and lunch room

         	 

street cars have to be powerful in
pittsburgh on account of the hills
therefore they show plenty of speed on
the level one of the fastest electric rides

i	ever had was on a sewickley car heading
for the barn on its last trip this route
traverses the length of nevilles island on
a private right-of-way and that car was
going so fast and swaying so violently that

i	thought it would be derailed or that the
car body would jump off the trucks a few
days later one of these cars was derailed
near the eastern end of this island it
plunged into the back water of the ohio
river and drowned i dont know how
many persons

  late one night i was on a route  car
going up the long gentle grade of west
liberty avenue-a dark gloomy street
running through a little valley suddenly
near brookside avenue the motorman
made an emergency-brake application
then lie opened his door and jumped-
but nothing happened

  the telephone company had been put-
ting in some new cable along this street
and had left one of those huge wooden
drums over a manhole in the street an
auto hit it and sent it rolling down west
liberty avenue it got in the southbound
car track and continued on its way taking
all curves what had scared our motor-
man almost to death was this big wooden
drum looming up before him out of the
gloom it passed us silently and ghost-
like

	 

a few of the grades on pittsburgh
trolley lines reach about thirty per
cent beltzhoover avenue on the knox-
ville route has two very steep ones one
descending the other ascending on one
occasion i was on an old four-wheel open
summer car descending beltzhoover
avenue another similar car was nearing
the top of the ascending grade ahead of
us something happened i dont know


railroad stories

what but the car ahead of us began to
come back down the hill picking up speed

  the motorman of the car i was on
stopped and reversed without wasting
time to get a back up signal from his
conductor or looking to see if the back
trail was clear he went full speed back up
the hill we had just descended

  fortunately the car back of us did the
same thing finally it see-sawed to a stop
in the sag no one was hurt but we all
had quite a thrill i dont know what the
trouble was even if the power went off
and the hand brake failed those old cars
had generator brakes-that is brakes
which used the regenerated current from
the motors when the car was coasting

  some idea of operating conditions can be
gained from the fact that every motorman
is required at a designated place on his
route invariably on a down grade to bring
his car to a stop with the hand brake and
test his sand on one line the trafford
city express the car used to go into the
craft avenue barn on every trip for brake
inspection and adjustment

  when the pittsburgh railways co first
raised the fare from a nickel they used
paper tickets printed on only one side i
wonder how many pieces of cardboard
blank on both sides they found in their
cash boxes before they started to print on
both sides nowadays they use tokens

         	 

some time ago the trolley wheel of a
street car in rochester n y came
off the wire while turning east onto main
street at university avenue the fork that
held the trolley wheel jammed and pulled
the entire trolley-pole assembly as well as
about ten feet of running board off the
roof before the car could be stopped

  this happened about  pm at peak
load period immediately traffic was tied
up as this switch was used by about eight
car lines each motorman and conductor
had his own idea as to how to get traffic
moving most of them wanted to switch
the car to another track and push it to a
car barn

  then one of them solved the problem

he disconnected the wire leading from the
cab along the car roof from the trolley
assembly bent the end of it in the shape
of a  y  and then standing onthe re-
maining vooden running board he held
one fork of the  y  against the trolley
wire while the car proceeded when one
fork of the wire got hot he switched to the
other fork

  the car loaded with passengers pro-
ceeded through the heart of rochesters
business district during the rush hour as
though nothing had happened traffic was
tied up less than three minutes

            

pittsburgh car lines operate two
interurban routes one from pittsburgh
to charleroi pa about thirty miles dis-
tant and another to washington pa
about twenty-five miles they also oper-
ate street cars in those two cities as well
as in other towns along the way while
practically all other electric interurban
lines around pittsburgh have been aban-
doned on account of bus competition these
two lines are still going strong and i hope
they will continue to do so one of the
most pleasant outings i ever had was a trip
to washington pa on the electric and
from there to waynesburg on the old
narrow-gage steam-operated w  wrr

  one of my neighbors traveled from pitts-
burgh to boston mass practically all the
way by electric interurban lines he went
from pittsburgh to newcastle pa on the
old  harmony  route from there he
went to youngstown then cleveland then
erie and buffalo from buffalo he used
the rochester lockport  buffalo to
rochester then the rochester  syracuse
electric to syracuse and various lines until
he got into western massachusetts there
he ran out of electric lines and had to make
a  portage  by steam roads until he came
to more electric lines that took him into
boston try and do it today

          	 

street cars arent so slow i recently
clocked a route  car on island
road philadelphia doing forty-five miles
per hour

any one street car company did have
an aviation department though during
the philadelphia sesqui-centennial in

abandonments of street-car lines

 george
stephenson

stephensons first
engine locomotion

 -ack in  a young north
country englishman named
v george stephenson cherished a
hope of improving his fortunes
by emigrating to the united
states but an unforeseen event arose to
dash that hope to the ground england
was engaged in the napoleonic wars and
one fine day this young mine-engine brake-
man was summoned for militia service to
obey would have meant leaving his mother-
less little boy and an old blind father at
the mercy of the world so he bought his
exemption with his scanty savings the
money that was to have paid the passage
across the atlantic

  his luck turned a couple of years later
and by  his mechanical skill had
earned him the job of chief engine-wright
in his employers mines about a dozen
miles from his workplace at the wylam
mine his friends hedley foster and
hackworth began experimenting with loco-
motives around this time and george got
interested finally he decided to tackle the
idea for himself and secured his companys
permission to go ahead and try

  stephensons first iron horse in  was
a queer contraption but it worked better
than any of the dozen engines the world
had yet seen he kept on trying and his
later engines went into regular daily ser-

  vice hauling coal to the quays his com-
pany let him lay out roads for other mines
and stephenson was able to pocket several
orders for locomotives as well

  in  when he was just forty years
old he came to the notice of a wealthy
quaker named edward pease a retired
woolen merchant who was steering the
fortunes of the stockton  darlington
railway project as a sort of hobby pease
took a great liking for the capable mine
engineer and saw in him the man to build
their railroad stephenson was hired for
the job and made up his mind that the
iron horse would play a big part in the
success of the worlds first public line he
and pease therefore planned ahead for the
day when the directors were ready to give
locomotive power a tryout

  on june   george and his son
robert now a young fellow of twenty held
a conference in the george inn at new-
castle with edward pease and michael
longridge owner of the bedlington iron
works the outcome was the founding of
robert stephenson  co the worlds
pioneer locomotive factory there were
five partners pease acting for his cousin
richardson and also staking young robert
to his share the youngster was elected
 managing partner  on condition that his
father plan the engines and superintend

co nstruction
twenty-five
years later pease
recorded in his
diary how strange
it was  that this
effort to aid a
worthy youth by
lending 
 without
expectation of
profit had
brought him an-
other fortune he
added that he
had drawn from
the business
 profit
during the year of  alone

  they erected their shop on fourth st
newcastle alongside burrells foundry in
which the elder stephenson was a partner
at that time right away they booked
some orders for pumping and steamboat
machinery in order to get the little plant
on its feet

  eventually the stockton  darlington
ry agreed to give locomotive power a
trial and on september   robert
stephenson  co booked their first loco-
motive order the first iron horses ever
bought by a railway company from an
engine building plant

  one was the famous  locomotion
which made its first journey from shildon
to stockton  miles on september th
 just about a century ago it hauled
a -ton load at more than ten miles an
hour george stephenson himself was
engineer the  locomotion  now stands
in the darlington station of the london 
north eastern ry as the pioneer of rail-
way companies locomotives

  young stephensons adventurous spirit
had led him off to south america as a min-
ing engineer earlier that year and long-
ridge was trying to run the factory but
without much success george stephenson
was almost too busy to give the plant a
thought for he had already been com-
missioned as engineer for the liverpool 

manchester ry a vastly bigger scheme
than the s  d he knew of one man
who could run things successfully his old
friend hackworth who had assisted with
the pioneer locomotives at wylam so
hackworth was temporarily installed as
manager and things looked up again later
on hackworth resigned to become resident
engineer of the s  d

  things got in a jam financially how-
ever the factory began to run at a loss
and the railway owed it a big sum more-
over the railway was not pleased with its
iron horses they expected too much
from these pioneer locomotives and when
they found the engines giving trouble
talked about abandoning steam power be-
fore it had really had a fair trial pease
and richardson declared for closing down
the plant before they lost too much money
but in  robert stephenson returned
home and took charge again he was now
a much more experienced engineer and the
plant was his future job so he set himself
to recover the lost ground

  that same year hackworth built in the
s  d shops an improved engine called
the  royal george  that restored the
railway directors confidence in locomotives
the stephensons were working their hard-
est to put over the idea of steam traction
with the liverpool  manchester ry and
they arranged a visit of l  m directors
to the s  d then tipped off hackworth
to get the power fixed up for the great
day the l  m chiefs were enough im-
pressed by what they saw to order an in-
dependent investigation on locomotive trac-
tion so stephensons got busy on some new
iron steeds that would show the world a
thing or two

meanwhile in  foreign engi-
neers were over in england checking
up on these new-fangled  locomotive
carriages  they had been hearing all
about the stephensons found ready
buyers for the engines intended for the
l  m one went to france along with
a trial engine declined by the s  d while
another was bought by horatio allen the

january  in abell  dunscombes
iron yard on water st new york city
and gave a working demonstration jacked
up on blocks that was four months be-
fore the arrival of rastricks  stourbridge
lion which gained the honor of being the
first real locomotive to turn a wheel on
american track the stephensons engine
was never put on rails but was used as a
pumping engine

  eventually the l  m ry scheduled a
locomotive test for october  offering
a  premium for the best engine sub-
mitted robert stephenson got busy on
another machine for the trial this being
the plants nineteenth production one
day they found young burstall another
competitors son coolly examining the half-
built engine in their shops nobody
seemed to know just how he got in but
he went out a lot quicker than he entered

  the story of how the  rocket  won
out in the trials on april   after a
hard tussle with hackworths  sanspareil
is interesting hackworth had been obliged
to buy his castings from the stephensons
and because a burst cylinder finally put his

engine out of the running certain enemies
of the newcastle factory stated outright
that the whole contest had been rigged to
favor the stephensons engine hack-
worth himself although badly set back
made no fool charges he probably had
enough brains to know that the stephen-
sons were too big to be crooked and that
the  rocket  might just as easily have
been the one that burst a cylinder foundry
work being what it was in those days

  hackworth was a very clever engineer
and came out all right in the finish he
eventually started his own plant at shildon
darlington which built many an engine be-
tween then and  it always seems too
bad that he never teamed up with the
stephensons the latter became too suc-
cessful as railroad builders to be able to
give more than a fraction of their attention
to the newcastle plant and it was mainly
run by subordinates some of them were
smart men but none were of hackworths
caliber and experience a combination of
stephensons reputation with the brains of
hackworth and his equally famous son
would have been unbeatable as it turned
out the stephenson plant was in the long
run ousted from its premier place by rival
companies controlled personally by men of
hackworths type

  as a result of the l  m trial the new-
castle firm supplied the power to stock up
that road steam tractions great battle
was won and robert stephenson  co was
highballed through with a clear board

  three more of their iron steeds were ex-
ported to the united states soon after-
ward there was the six-coupled engine
 whistler or  america of the boston
 providence in  next year came the
 robert fulton  for the mohawk  hud-
son and the  john bull  for the camden
 amboy

  mr matthias w baldwin examined
these last two engines and they are said
to have provided him with enough ideas to
build  old ironsides  and the  e l
miller pioneers of the vast baldwin line
of iron horses

  after many years retirement old  john
bull  took tp the rails again in  it
hauled an old-time camden  amboy train
to chicago for exhibition at the worlds
fair and traveled more than  miles
from new york city over the pennsy
route entirely unaided the  john bull 
now rests quietly in the smithsonian in-
stitution in washington d c as the old-
est complete locomotive in north america

rival builders started up in england
 but work was plentiful in  con-
sequently robert stephenson was invited
by liverpool citizens to join another ven-
ture in their part of the country after
some opposition chiefly from longridge
the other partners gave their consent stipu-
lating that the name of stephenson must
not be used and that the older plant was
to have a half option on all roberts orders
the new firm equipped a factory at new-
ton near liverpool under the name of
 tayleur  co vulcan foundry as
the vulcan foundry ltd it ranks oday
as one of englands foremost locomotive
plants

  from the start robert stephenson  co
was ahead of all competitors they won
the confidence-and the orders for iron
horses-of the companies whose roads they
built but rivals maintained that the new-
castle firm was trading on its name alone
and unloading junk on buyers the twelve
years following the l  m trials were one

slander around  enemies influenced

stephenson was chief engineer for that

trading with firms in which its own officials
held stock still there was enough busi-
ness to keep things going

was for two six-foot gage engines for a
new orleans rr in  but the road
was unable to find the price and they were
altered to seven-foot gage to suit the new
great western ry in england one of
them the  north star was that famous
roads pioneer-a great performer

  the stephenson plant got the jump on
its rivals again in  with the patent
 long-boiler  type it made a fortune for
the partnership for besides the hundreds
that were built in stephenson shops the
number constructed by continental euro-
pean plants ran to four figures and on each
of them a handsome royalty was collected
a feature that helped its big success was
the familiar stephenson link-motion in-
vented  by two stephenson employees
williams and howe and incorporated in
all their engines after the first few  long-
boilers

  old george stephenson died in 
and inheritance of his share made his son
the chief partner in the firm but robert
stephenson was by then a busy civil engi-
neer traveling far and wide in foreign

lands his fame and influence gained the
factory many valuable foreign orders
and put them in the leading posi-
tion in the export business it was
probably the first plant to notch a total of

 engines constructed counting in the
ten or dozen engines built by george
stephenson before the partnership was
formed their thousandth production was
one of three fine -- passenger engines
made for the old grand trunk system in
 these three with the  dorchester 
of  and another engine built in 
were the only stephenson locomotives ever
imported by canada

  richardson and longridge died in the
fifties leaving the oldest and youngest of
the original partners surviving although
fresh associates were taken in to fill the
vacancies in  at the age of  grand
old edward pease died his undimmed
brain had maintained its interest right to
the end although in his last few years he
was too feeble to attend the partners meet-
ings his great-grandson lord daryngton
today provides the remaining link with the
old partnership and assists in directing the
affairs of the present firm of robert
stephenson  co ltd

  robert stephenson himself survived
pease only by a year dying at the early
age of  his health undermined by a life
of careless and unsparing energy so
passed the last of the original band that
 deserving youth  whom the old quaker
had been proud to help

after his death his holdings in the firm
passed to a younger cousin george
robert stephenson also a railroad builder
who took control of the plant
worlds oldest locomotive works



  times were not always so good the
big english railways the best buyers in
earlier years got rich enough to equip
locomotive plants of their own the
crewe works of the london  north
western alone built  engines between
 and  while only two private
plants in britain kept step with that pace

  although four or five british plants dur-
ing the second half of the nineteenth cen-
tury surpassed the stephenson works in
the actual total of engines turned out the
factory kept a very high place in the in-
dustry however around  the loco-
motive trade fell on lean years robert
stephenson  co had a fine shipbuilding
business established around  and they
seriously considered laying off railroad
work for good but a few years later trade
again took a favorable turn

  a new factory was projected at darling-
ton thirty miles south from newcastle
and a reorganization was effected in 
the locomotive works and the shipyard
were split and became separate public com-
panies while g r stephenson then eighty
years old retired from business thereby
severing the last link of the firm with the
stephenson family

  the first production from the new plant
was completed in  and twelve months
later it was building engines twice the
weight of any that ever left the old struc-
ture india egypt south africa and
south am erica were heavy buyers

  during the world war the plant was
constructing guns for the british navy and

also made thousands of tons of shells loco-
motive work being suspended for a couple
of years toward the end of the war
when extensions had been completed
nearly a hundred big freight engines were
built for the british army

  since the war business has failed to pick
up according to expectations and there
have been abnormal handicaps to contend
with two or three vast shipbuilding cor-
porations turned their surplus machine
shops into locomotive plants and were able
to cut the ground from under the feet of
established locomotive plants moreover
in the great british railway consolidations
of  the smaller locomotive-buying
lines merged in the big systems which built
their own power and after that the chances
of home business just about vanished for
the private firms although the stephen-
son plant is still operating and paying a
dividend its business has fallen off

  a remarkable order came along in 
henry ford commissioned the stephenson
co to build an exact replica of the old
 rocket  for his detroit museum while
a similar replica was later ordered by the
chicago museum of sciences imagine
booking two repeat orders after  years
have elapsed the  rocket  itself has a
place in the science museum at london

  about a dozen countries owed their
pioneer iron horses to the stephenson firm
and one of the most remarkable features of
its history is the number of its productions
preserved in different parts of the world
on account of their historic value

 conquering the hoosac

by clif belcher

t was in  that men spat
upon their hands and began to
drill a hole four and three-quar-
ters miles through hoosac
mountain in western massa-
chusetts their goal was to link boston
with troy n y by rail the road had
been surveyed but flung across its path
lay solid rock-rock that towered to an al-
titude of  feet

  the tunnel cost money and it cost lives
before the first damp draft had hurried
through the bore from portal to portal
 human beings had been sacrificed and
the sum of  had been expended
by the time the steel gangs entered to lay
rails daniel oconnell veteran section
foreman of the tunnel used to tell of the
time when as a boy he carried drills and
assisted in the hoosac there was a chalk
line drawn about a stain on the rock wall
where nitro glycerine had been spilled
when the stain disappeared two months

later men prepared to work the spot at the
first touch of a drill there was a mighty
blast that killed two men

  it was by accident that a safe way of
handling the deadly nitro was discovered
and credit for its discovery belongs to the
hoosac tunnel job

  nate smith set out in a little sled over
the snow-covered mountain with a load of
liquid explosive it was a bitterly cold
day and the horses slipped and stumbled
on the icy slopes

  at length one of the horses fell and
dragged down his mate the sled skidded
and the whole outfit slithered over the
brink and tumbled down the mountainside
smith jumped clear and flattened out in
the snow expecting the inevitable blast and
shower of rock but nothing happened

  cautiously smith crept to the edge and
looked down to see his horses struggling in
a tangle of harness forgetting his own
danger he lowered himself to liberate the
conquering the hoosac



team of which he was fond then it was
discovered the nitro had been frozen to a
state of harmlessness thereafter all nitro
was artificially frozen before it left the
mowbray plant at the west portal

  one of the greatest disasters of construc-
tion occurred in the central ventilating
shaft midway through the tunnel a dozen
men trapped by an explosion stood help-
less while death in the form of shattered
timbers cascaded down to pin them to the
floor of the shaft

  smoke curled through the debris and
soon flames filled the shaft while one after
another perished bravely trying to help
broken comrades to reach the surface res-
cue workers were driven back again and
again while grief-stricken relatives stood
tearfully silent until all hope was gone

  thus men labored and died while crews
from the east portal drilled and crews from
the west portal drilled until the two gangs
met-and the tunnel was opened

  on october   a train pulled out
of north adams the division point
aboard were rail and state officials train-
men moved through the coaches closing
vents and lighting the old burners at the
yawning mouth of the tunnel a brass band
elevated on a decorated platform played
with lively tempo thus saluted the first
train entered hoosac tunnel  years after
the project was first begun

  that first journey like many others that
were to follow was featured by lung-biting
smoke the fan that whirled above in the
central shaft failed to suck out much of the
rolling cloud that accompanied each pass-
ing train two smaller shafts on either
side made no more than feeble attempts to
clear the atmosphere within

  danger now stalked the section men
for the tunnel was so narrow that no mat-
ter how close a man stood to its wall he
could not escape being struck by a train
work was begun to create  man-holes
and crevices were dug into the walls 
feet apart where a dozen men might stand
in safety while a train passed

  smoke however remained the major
worry until  when the tunnel was elec-

 trified and electric engines picked up trains
 at hoosac tunnel station a mile east of
 the bore hauling them to north adams
 station a mile beyond the west portal

   passing through the hoosac today is no
 more than an incident to the journey but
 in early days it was the thrill of a lifetime
 so anxious were people to view the tunnel
 from within that all sorts of bribes were
 offered workers to escort visitors through
 the hole before the job was completed

   dan oconnell and denny scully as
 boys commercialized on this human weak-
 ness for a thrill on sundays and holidays
 they would don raincoats go to the north
 adams yard and appropriate a hand car

   the word was passed around and people
 by the score paid the boys a dollar a head
 to pump them a half mile into the uncom-
 pleted tunnel and out again by nightfall
 muscles ached and hands were calloused
 but pockets bulged with dollars and the
 boys went home with a smile

a tale of the days when
brass hats endangered lives
rather than spend money
for safety appliances

fifty years after the birth
of the iron horse railroad-
i ing had become americas
mlruj most hazardous occupation

  power speed and tonnage
had increased to the point where
human hands could not safely control
the movement of trains and engines
collision derailment death dismem-
berment-these were the items which
filled the columns of the daily news

  the greatest hazards lay in coupling
and control inventors sought devices
whereby cars could be hitched and
speeding trains braked without the ap-
palling loss of life they were claim-
ing for fifty years the quest con-
tinued then in  both the auto-
matic air brake and the janney coupler
were perfected and thrown on the mar-
ket

  harrassed railroad men looked to
them with hope they looked but their
ills were not healed to equip cars and
engines with safety appliances required
money officials didnt like to spend
it because their jobs depended on the
roads paying dividends and so
the years moved along with link coup-
ler and hickory club claiming their
daily human sacrifice

  the  big four  brotherhoods took
up the fight representatives of the
engineers conductors firemen and
trainmen conferred with their man-
agement and urged immediate install-
ation of life-saving devices the offi-
cials countered that installation on
equipment in service would bankrupt
the railroads they promised eventual
relief and there they let the matter
rest
  such was the situation when in
 mike corrigan went braking on
the ka out of osawatomie mike
was born to the rail his father a
ka conductor had been mashed be-
tween two boxcars when the drawbars
slipped by his elder brother jim was
running a freight engine out of osawa-
tomie

  jim was active in the engineers
brotherhood imbibing its conservative
rule that it is better to bargain than
to fight he was a conservative mike
was not tall dark slender with
piercing black eyes and impassioned
speech he gave promise of impulsive
aggressive leadership and when he
joined the trainmen at the age of
eighteen impulsive aggressive men
were in the saddle

  wherever railroads ran radical
brothers were preaching the crusade
for compulsory protection to railroad
men

  if the companies wont give it well
strike they promised  well refuse
to turn a wheel until the heartless dol-
lar-grabbers install air brakes and auto-
matic couplers on these murder ma-
chines and stop the needless butchery
of railroad men

  mike heard their preaching and was
converted he would have become an
apostle even before that night at red
bridge save for the calm counsel of
his elder brother

railroad stories

a december blizzard raged
across the plains of central kan-
sas the wind drove dirty snow
through the cracks of the rickety
wooden lodging house in council
grove where the corrigans were sleep-
ing snow and sand sifted through
broken windows to pile in tiny wind-
rows on the uneven floor or spread out
in a dirty film over the covers

  in the early winter twilight a stum-
bling step jarred the rickety wooden
stair a fumbling hand shook the rat-
tly door a hoarse youthful voice
shouted  come on out of it you dead-
heads 

  mike and jim were dead to the
world gould motive power already
swamped under the load of the grain
and stock rushes were crippled now
by the blizzard men were breaking
under the strain of cold and hours and
tonnage at noon they had brought in
a drag on which they had left kansas
city thirty hours earlier

  mike aroused first to the knocking
he blinked through the gloom stump-
ing through the chill air he opened
the door for the waiting caller

   you guys gettin a stock drag east
yuh goin to load em at the chutes
and take em on into kansas city

  what mike said to that waked up
jim mike cussed the railroad com-
pany and everything pertaining to it
from jay gould down to the wind-
blistered caller when he had finished
with the company he commenced on
the brotherhoods

   whatn blazes you guys been doin
for the last twenty-five years he de-
manded of jim  why dont these
organizations have contracts so a man
can stay in bed fifteen minutes without
a little shrimp of a caller kickin him
out before he gets asleep an orderin
him to load a lot of bellerin bulls that

yard crews ought to have loaded before
hes called 

  jim rubbed his blue eyes yawned
sleepily and said  dont bust a blood
vessel kid its cornin in a few
years from now well have everything
weve asked for all it takes is time
yeah time thats all ive
heard since the air brake was invented
time what do you engineers care if
us brakemen have to stand out in the
blizzard spottin stock cars whats it
to you if we get our legs cut off set-
tin brakes on the icy tops it aint
your legs that gets cut off it aint
your nose that freezes youre safe
an warm in your cab

  we engineers are waitin jim
interrupted slyly  for the outfit to go
into the ditch when the brakes dont
hold waitin for steam pipes to break
an cook us alive or for the wreck to
catch fire and roast us you trainmen
aint got anything on us kid

  mike had heard of that scalding and
roasting process but he had never
thought of it as being a prospect for
an engineer he looked to see if jim
was laughing at him jim was not
his blue eyes were in dead earnest his
face was serious

  mike smothered the hot retort he
had ready and walked in silence to the
lunch counter he had no banter for
katy obrien when she came for his
order he did not deliver his custom-
ary oration when her father pegleg
pat came up to say that a drive was
on foot to force a bill through con-
gress compelling companies to install
safety appliances on all equipment he
ate paid his bill and went out leaving
jim and katy standing at the counter

at  they shoved thirty empty
-stock cars into the loading track
mike was out on top with club and lan-
link and pin



tern the wind hurtling madly across
a thousand miles of treeless plains
drove sleet and snow and sand in its
blistering blast it maddened the bel-
lowing milling herd which shoved fu-
tilely at the stock pens or fought the
keepers in the narrow chute outside

  while blizzards raged the men
worked pop mcgruder took the
ground limping between moving cars
as their speed slowed lifting pins out
of their links to let them roll back so
mike could spot them at the chutes

  out on top mike watched the chutes
drift toward him through the blizzard
foot by foot he moved along club set
in the frozen wheel  back easy
stop  the lantern signaled and when
the car was on the spot his stout arm
tightened the brakes on the slowing
wheels

  until nearly midnight the work con-
tinued mike spotted the cars the
punchers drove in the cattle pop mc-
gruder sealed the doors they built
a fire by the corner of the pens and
when their services were not in de-
mand trainmen and punchers took
turns dashing up to the fire to keep
from freezing

  the wind roared on voices were
on the wind-voices which moaned
and sobbed and cried once when the
old section man who was bedding
stock cars paused open mouthed to
listen to a wailing blast mike looked
at him the old man whispered
 sounds like the banshee screamin
boy wonder whos dyintonight

  mike laughed shortly his mother
had used to frighten him into submis-
sion with wild tales of the banshee in
the old country all tommyrot but
still he couldnt help remembering that
someone always died when the banshee
screamed and he couldnt help remem-
bering that crack jim had made

  the blizzard blew itself out stars
came to burn coldly through the haze
the voices hushed when the last car
was sealed mike climbed stiffly down
from its top to make couplings and get
his train together pop limped pain-
fully toward the caboose whither the
boisterous stockmen were going pop
stopped to warn mike

   be careful kid its on nights like
this that trainmen miss their step and
low drawbars slide under

  mike was careful but he alone did
not run the railroad

seven train loads of cattle were on
the ka that night they were
running as sections of no  the
first two went by the stockyards while
corrigans crew was loading the en-
gine on first no  was foaming
like a soap factory because too much
water had been run boiled into its
boiler since it had been washed

  second no  left council grove at

	in its caboose were eleven
stockmen conductor olinger and
flagman jones olinger kept his
safeguard against low temperature in
a quart bottle many trainmen did in
those days

  jones who was about mikes age
was a smart brakeman he had learned
more about railroading in three years
than the men who made the rule book
had learned in a lifetime

  a few miles from council grove the
second section overtook the first one
as it was doubling into bushong ac-
cording to the rules jones should have
left the caboose immediately and gone
back a quarter of a mile to protect his
own train against any other which
might be following

  but it was cold his caboose was on
a hill instead of going back jones
climbed out of the cupola set his red


railroad stories

lantern and a couple of unlighted
fusees on the rear platform where he
could get them if he needed them left
a crack in the door so he could hear an
engine if it came up the hill and did
his flagging by the red-hot stove the
eleven stockmen did not object they
were merely passengers olinger did
not object either he was already
warming up with his bottle

  they were there forty minutes they
followed first no  up to bushong
there they met no  and no  be-
ing a smart brakeman jones watched
to see whether no  went on down the
hill it did and he knew the third
stock train was not very close

  he asked the engineer of no 
what other trains they were meeting at
bushong

   weve not got anything on third
fifty-four the hoghead answered
and jones knew that while the follow-
ing section was not very close it was
also not very far away

  they left bushong at  half-
way down the hill engineer carver be-
gan calling for brakes jones figured
something had gone wrong with the
train ahead he damned the junkpile
pulling it and the men running it
dropped off two fusees and stayed in
the caboose until they had burned up

  by that time he figured corrigan
ought to be coming shortly he started
back flagging intending to go a long
way this time because his caboose was
on the downhill side of the divide and
it took time to stop freight trains run-
ning down hill

  no  came by the stockyard at
 mike had finished coupling up
his train had drunk a cup of hot cof-
fee and had finished reading his or-
ders one of those orders instructed
conductor mcgruder with engine no
 to run as third no  from coun-

cil grove to osawatomie and another
instructed him to meet no  at
bushong they left the stockyard
with a pusher and they went through
bushong at 

  pat was a good engineer he not
only figured what he was going to do
but also what the other fellow would be
likely to do because he did he made
the schedule without being reckless

  tonight he remembered that second
no  had left council grove an hour
ahead of him he figured it would be
far enough to the east so that if any-
thing happened its flagman could get
back to give him a stop sign he
turned down bushong hill at a pretty
good clip and did not call for brakes
until he hit twenty miles an hour

mike was on top of the head car
another light was near the mid-
dle of the train although mike could
not see him he knew pop mcgruder
was watching both those lights from a
cupola window conductors always
watched brakemens lights for they
never knew when one of them would
go down and not come up

  mike tied down three cars before
jim called for brakes he soon set four
more he knew pop would set the
caboose brake and that the swing man
would tie down a flock of them in the
middle of the train these with the
engine brakes for emergency would
hold the train in good shape bushong
hill was not a mountain grade

  biting wind blew out of the north
running boards wore patches of ice
and snow frost sifted from frozen
stars mike found a dry place and sat
on a running board to wait until jim
called to release the brake he tucked
his lantern between his knees and the
odor of burning oil filtered upward
with heat from the flaming lantern
link and pin



  before the train had rolled a mile a
whistle blast cracked the frozen air
mike knew something was wrong the
regulation brakes were set yet jim was
telling them to set brakes as if his life
depended on his signal

  as mike darted over the top to grab
another wheel he flung one glance
down the track he saw red lights
gleaming he did not count them but
he knew there were two markers and
a cupola light forming a triangle and a
huge red flare sputtering in the dark-
ness

  mike forgot he was cold he even
forgot that air brakes would have pre-
vented what he thought was going to
happen the lights came nearer the
red fusee sputtering in the cut passed
him and flagman jones swarmed up
the ladder and hurried past him shout-
ing   set em tight kid youre right
into us

  mike did not even think about jump-
ing he was not hired to jump but
he was hired to set brakes then there
was jims whistle warning stockmen
in the caboose that death was on the
iron

  but death did not hold the ace in
that hand jim corrigan held it he
had some straight air on his engine
which he had saved for emergency he
used it and when he was traveling
slowly enough he reversed and worked
steam he stopped his pilot three feet
from olingers caboose where the con-
ductor by now pretty well warmed up
was frantically waving a red lantern

  both crews and eleven stockmen
gathered at the rear platform and
talked olinger wanted to know what
in thunder an engineer meant coming
down a hill a thousand miles an hour
when he knew another train was right
ahead of him mike reckoned that if
they had had air brakes on that train

it would have been stopped before it
got in whistling distance jim slyly
suggested that maybe if jones had not
been flagging from the back platform
of the caboose he would have had
plenty of room to stop

 jones laughed and said we
stopped em didnt we

  and with everybody agreed that
they had stopped in time the trains
proceeded when the track was clear

  seven times that day things hap-
pened to the trains ahead of them
they ran into cuts filled with sand and
snow and had to shovel out they
doubled hills they stopped on the
level to raise steam they broke in
two and ran together

  seven times jones came back flag-
ging he swore he had worn out a
brand new pair of shoes running but
he ran plenty far

 dont be a fool

at  that evening they were in
ottawa at  they were in
osawatomie and at  they were
ready to pull on up the hill they
were rejoicing because the first section
had a new engine

   maybe well go to town now
mike boasted  weve got that jonah
out from ahead of us

  they did they walked over paola
hill to wagstaff and across the flats
to bucyrus they were through there
at  everything was running like
clockwork before they turned down
to stillwell jim called mike over

   you twist her tail a minute kid
he said  i believe weve got water
enough to run this mastin tank if


railroad stories

we have we can go to leeds for water
and maybe go in for number one

  jim went over the tank with a
clinker hook to measure his water he
came back grinning

   how yuh fixed  queried mike

   ok we got plenty if olinger
and jones aint fooling around down
here well go through mastin like a
bat out of a brushpile

  they did not see olinger and jones
because first no  now had a good
engine and both it and the second sec-
tion had been stepping along engi-
neer carver on second no  how-
ever was a careful runner he never
ran a water tank or a pie counter he
took water at mastin

  jones tossed off a red fusee a mile
above the tank it was made to burn
ten minutes a following train was not
permitted to pass the burning flare un-
til it had gone out the one jones
threw off burned out before he left the
tank and he threw off another

  the corrigans kept their train under
control coming down the hill every-
thing was clear before them they
did not see the fusee which jones had
thrown off because it had burned out
two minutes before they came out of
the cut

  they let off brakes and came by the
tank running thirty miles an hour
they made a good run to martin city
the order board there was clear and
unaware that the operator had had to
shade the time a few seconds in order
to clear him and unaware also that the
engine on second no  was develop-
ing a leaky flue jim opened up

  leaving martin city the track soon
runs into thick woods and at a point
not far from red bridge turns down a
short steep grade through a maze of
curves following the banks of blue
river

  jones was still attending to busi-
ness when his engineer tipped over
the hill toward red bridge after crawl-
ing halfway from martin city he
knew it was time to throw off another
fusee

  he scratched a fusee and tried to
spike it in the end of a tie instead
of spiking the fusee landed on its side
and rolled into the ballast jones
watched it and when he went out of
sight around a curve it was still burn-
ing

  it did not burn long however two
minutes from its outer end was a flaw
where the paper cylinder had crumpled
and stopped the tube the fusee
burned to this flaw sputtered and went
out just as engineer carver began
calling for brakes down by red
bridge jones in the caboose figured
he had plenty of time because he
thought his fusee would burn ten min-
utes he went back flagging at a brisk
walk

third no  approached the top
of red bridge hill mike buttoned
his coat and started out of the cab to
use his club jim stopped him jim
had been using his head he had slowed
and bunched the slack so he could con-
trol his train with engine air he called
 no use goin back there kid i can
handle em

   but suppose olinger had trou-
ble-

  if olinger had been havin trou-
ble jones would have left a red one
burning

  mike faltered he did not know
that jones had left a red one burning
a red one which had failed he looked
at his brother alert and watchful and
remembered what jim had said last
night about engineers cooking in steam
or roasting in burning wreckage may-
link and pin



this time death held the aces a
hundred-ton locomotive crashed
into the rear of the crummy

be hunch was talking to him he called
over his shoulder  im goin any-
how you never know whats around
the next curve

  again he took his station on the
head car he did not expect jim to
call for brakes tonight but when he
was halfway to red bridge he heard
the whistle burst out screaming in-
stantly he was on his feet by the
slackening speed he knew that jim had
used the straight air on the engine the
whistle was ringing the flare of a
fusee was hurtling toward him he
heard jones startled voice yell
jump for gods sake

  mike did not heed the warning his
brother was still on that engine his
whistle screaming to warn those eleven
stockmen in olingers caboose that for
a second time death was on the iron

  but this time death held the aces
mike never even saw the tail lights
he was too busy setting brakes the
crash hurled him face down on a run-

ning board he groped and found a
hand hold as he felt the car rise on
its hind legs then he felt it settle
sidewise and go swishing down
through the tops of tall cottonwoods
which lined the banks of the blue
river

  he kept falling for a thousand
years he never knew when he
stopped when he came to he heard
pop mcgruder saying  i reckon hes
done for too

  mike blinked through the dim lan-
tern light into mcgruders grimy face
and queried dumbly  me an who
else

  mcgruder did not reply he helped


railroad stories

mike to his feet and they went back
to a pile of overcoats up at the foot of
the high fill where jims engine had
plowed through olingers caboose

  there was nothing anyone could do
there is not much to be done for an
engineer when a hundred-ton locomo-
tive has stepped in his middle not
though the iron horse has touched
hoof and kept going

  unable to carry him to the caboose
the men had already made a bed of
cushions and covered him with over-
coats mike knelt beside him on the
frozen ground with frost sparkling on
dead cottonwood leaves

  jim knew he was there jim opened
his eyes and breathed  tough luck
kid

  mike gripped the hand hysterically

   luck hell its murder damn
the greedy railroads damn the weak-
kneed brotherhoods

  an hour passed stars sparkled on
the labored breathing of the wrecked
boiler grew feeble and died the lowing
of cattle subsided as the wounded were
killed and the flagman returned to
report the wrecker coming

  the pulse of the man grew weaker
stockmen whose lives his sacrifice had
saved built a fire down by the river
by its light flickering on the frost and
the ice and the white stems of cotton-
wood trees they stood together and
talked in low voices

  presently jim spoke again

   my watch kid he said  give
it to katy will you

  mike nodded jim and katy had
intended to be married on christmas

  jim kept moving restlessly he
seemed to be trying to leave a message
his eyes opened unsteadily and he
whispered

   kid

  mike bent to listen

   kid you got a lot of life before
you dont ruin it-by bein a fool
his lips mumbled once more  dont
be a fool

  mike heard the admonition he did
not understand it fully then he never
forgot it but he did not heed it jim
had been his counselor had urged cau-
tion tolerance and calmness instead of
frenzy now jim was gone mike
turned from the new mound to take up
the fight

he became an apostle of aggres-
sive radicalism he exhorted
members of his own brotherhood
singly and in groups to rise up and
force action from heartless officials
who were sending men down to death
rather than buy safety appliances

   weve got our own organizations
he declared  they are not working
together what we need is a brother-
hood of railroad men who will fight
under one banner each for all all for
each lets stop this dilly-dallying
this bargaining and talking and whee-
dling and stand up like men and fight
for our lives and our homes

  the corrigans had friends in osaw-
atomie they urged mike to hold his
tongue to use reason instead of im-
pulse

   officials of this pike wont stand
for the kind of gaff youre giving
they warned  some of these days
theyll call you on the carpet

  sure enough when jim had been
gone a month trainmaster p murphy
scoggins cornered mike coming off his
caboose one night

   i hear youve quit railroadin an
gone preachin kid he said coldly

  yeah mike flared back you
aint heard about my lellin anything
that aint so have you

  scoggins flushed
link and pin



   some truth maybe he admitted
mike laughed mirthlessly and eyed
the official hotly  you aint heard
nothing yet mr scoggins wait till
i get uncorked and im goin to tell
you and these birds something
scoggins did not speak for a long
time he stared foa while and when
he spoke it was quietly soothingly

   youre goin to learn that you cant
reform the world in a day you bet-
ter head into a blind sidin an take
another look at your runnin orders
kid think it over

  mike thought it over he could see
no need waiting for other men to die
it would cost no more to install safety
appliances now than it would five years
or ten years hence he swore no brass
hat could bully him and kept right on
talking

  in march scoggins now division
superintendent called him into the of-
fice and gave him his last pay check

   next job you get he advised
 remember you owe loyalty to the
company which pays you your wages
when you refuse to render it the only
thing the company can do is to replace
you with a man who will

  in the heat of anger mike blackened
a pair of official eyes and boastfully set
out to find a new job he found one
and then others but none of them
lasted-not because he failed to do his
work but because his references fol-
lowed him

  at first he considered it a joke
then it dawned upon him that whether
he went to california or florida offi-
cials were soon aware that he had been
an agitator and had whipped a super-
intendent in osawatoniie he under-
stood then what jim had meant by that
dying admonition he had been a
fool and the resentment which fol-
lowed the full realization that by so

doing he had ruined the prospects for
a railroad career did not cure him of
his folly

  he blamed the companies and the
brotherhoods for his predicament and
at twenty-one was an embittered
sharp-tongued agitator fomenting trou-
ble and discord

the storm at crazy creek

thats what he was that summer
night in  when he came to
the caboose of atlantic  pacifics cal-
ifornia merchandise train in the yards
at gallup conductor  espee  senci
was on his way to the office with a
lighted lantern in his three-fingered
hand mike flashed the card on him
for despite his bitter disappointment
over the failure of the trainmen to
clear up his osawatomie reference he
was still carrying a paid-up card in the
order

   whats the chance riding with you
to winslow he queried

  sencil took the card in the three-
fingered hand and held it to the light
after a long inspection he handed it
back

   this is my caboose corrigan he
said  its goin to winslow

  mike thanked him and swung up the
platform

  espee was an old-timer a rack of
bones with a few yards of desert-baked
hide stretched tightly over it he wore
a pepper and salt suit with baggy trou-
sers a blue shirt with a red necktie
a brown plug hat with a dent in the
crown and a pair of the biggest con-
gress shoes mike had ever sen his
forehead was high his nose thin his


railroad stories

lips were parted by the stem of an
empty cob pipe whose bowl was up-
side down mike felt an instant lik-
ing for him

  there were passengers on the ca-
boose that night the trader going
home to manuelito two pueblo in-
dians and three cowpunchers also
a tall girl with frizzed bangs bobbing
over the blackest eyes mike had ever
seen she wore a neat black travel-
ing suit she was laughing and talk-
ing with the parlor brakeman who was
cleaning his lanterns

  mike had been too busy talking to
railroad men about their raw deal to
pay much attention to women but
when he stepped into espee sencils
caboose and that girl flashed those
black eyes questioningly up to him his
hand went instinctively to the crum-
pled tie at the neck of the black sateen
shirt and he wondered why he had not
shaved before he left gallup

  the girl looked at him and looked
again the parlor man gave him that
glance of disdain with which the home
guard so often favored the boomer
when mike had gone to sit by the
punchers he whispered something to
the girl which made both titter

  mike flushed he felt no love for
the brakeman while the fellow
cleaned and hung his markers mike
watched him critically and when the
markers had been hung and the box
of sand kicked significantly toward to-
bacco chewing passengers he and the
girl went into the cupola they did
not invite mike to go with them

  at  they pulled out of the yards
espee caught the caboose came inside
set his lanterns on the table and laid
his waybills beside it when they were
ten miles out he started toward the
cupola halfway there he turned to
mike

   might as well come on up to the
doghouse corrigan he invited

  mike thanked him and followed
espee introduced him to  my daugh-
ter jerrv and  my hind man rent-
fro

  the girl made room for her father
rentfro reluctantly moved over so
mike could sit in front of him on the
cushion

the train was soon rolling at a
good clip box cars swayed and
rocked and rattled the kerosene lamp
above the pine board table dimmed and
brightened mike watched the lamp
and the cars and ghostly crimson cliffs
flowing by like streaks of blood in the
moonlight

  after a while rentfro asked mike
 are you going to go to work out of
winslow 

  mike smiled bleakly he knew that
with his reference the ap would not
hire him then too he had heard that
on the ap most of the minor offi-
cials and some of the higher ones had
been hired from and still retained mem-
bership in the four old brotherhoods
that to mikes way of thinking was
not the way to keep the organizations
helping the men he insisted that if
union men became officials they would
soon be running the brotherhoods and
checkmating the men in their efforts to
better their conditions

   no i dont figure on stopping in
winslow he answered

   dont like the climate and the
scenery rentfro queried in a tone
in which mike thought he detected re-
lief

   i dont know much about either
mike answered soberly  but i dont
like your idea of letting the brass hats
run the brotherhoods its their busi-
ness to run the railroads
link and pin



  rentfro breathed a long drawn
o-ooh youre one of these radical
boys always on the prod eh

  mike had plenty of good answers
for that but he remembered he was a
guest rider he was also aware that
miss jerry sencil was listening and
somehow he had the feeling she and
her father might not approve of the
answers he would give for the first
time in his life he was concerned with
what somebody might think of his
ideas he merely replied yeah
maybe

  espee took his pipe from the cigar
box tacked between the cupola win-
dows filled it turned it right side
up and lighted it when it was go-
ing he said significantly

   if it hadnt been for the fighting
radicals rentfro brakemen like you
would have been in a lot worse shape
than they are today

  just then jerry called attention to
the cloud west of the moon rising out
of the painted desert and to the moon
wading into it to be  swallowed up
like a lost soul in purgatory mike
stared ahead watched webs of yellow
lightning weaving through the cloud

talk turned as it always did in
cab and cupola to organization
sencil quit pulling on his pipe to say
that he understood there was going to
be a brotherhood to include all rail-
road men

  yesterday mike could not possibly
have missed the chance to snarl back
if its not got more nerve than the
other four have it might as well not
be formed

  he kept his mouth shut and listened
to rentfro raving that it was merely
a scheme of the radical element to get
control of the brotherhoods yester-
day mike would not have stood for

that either but when he passed it
he became aware that a woman or an
orc with a three-fingered hand or
something had pulled a red board in
his face and made him head in to
read his running orders the realiza-
tion shocked him and he looked at the
girl again

  the engine whistled for manuelito
jack rentfro looked at his watch
yawned picked up his club and lan-
tern and toyed with it the conductor
kept watching him

   well jack he finally said  do i
have to tell you to throw oft a fusee
and set up a few brakes looks like
you could at least set up the caboose
without being told

  jack retired in sullen redfaced si-
lence to perform his duty sencil
went to the forward platform jerry
and mike were alone in the cupola
through the dim light he stared across
at her he wondered about her and
jack and then he wondered about her
and himself lightning filled the
cupola he knew that she wras look-
ing at him and that a faint smile was
on her face

  then jack rentfro tossed off the
fusee set up the caboose brake and
hurried back to the cupola he did
not go through the side window to set
other brakes but fell into the seat be-
side jerry

  fearing he might be the third one
who makes the crowd mike wondered
aloud if a boomer could set brakes on
the ap and without waiting for an
answer borrowed jacks lantern and
went out on top

  they were there for only a few min-
utes jack took his flag back a little
way the trader left the train sen-
cil came to the caboose with two or-
ders one of them was a meet with
an extra at navajo fifty miles beyond


railroad stories

the second informed them that no 
would wait at navajo until  for
extra  east

  when they were two miles from
manuelito espee said he thought con-
gress was going to pass the safety ap-
pliance act without fail

  mike could not resist the temptation
to say  its high time

  the conductor admitted that it was
mike bitterly declared that if it had
been passed when the brakes and coup-
lers were invented jim would still be
running an engine and he would not
be a homeless boomer he started to
say a lot more but before he said it
he remembered what jim had whis-
pered that night at red bridge and he
left it unsaid

  conversation lulled at ever short-
ening intervals lightning wiped night
off the face of the desert and engine
and cars stood out in its flare it was
a new experience for mike it was
not for the others

  espee predicted  theres going to
be a cloudburst in the hills tonight

  do you have many washouts
here mike asked

   too many espee replied soberly
 i thought the desert was supposed
to be a dry place

  mike grinned and looked at jerry
she flashed back  its is a dry place
till it rains

ten miles out of manuelito they
ran into the deluge a sixtv-mile
wind drove rain and hail fiercely
against the cupola windows the ca-
boose roof started leaking water

  	the safety appliance act requiring railroads
to equip all trains with automatic air-brakes and
automatic couplers was passed in  it gave
the railroads until  to complete installation
but the time was later extended by the icc
to 

streamed upon the conductors desk

  sencil started out of the cupola to
move his reports and waybills the
caboose was rocking and swaying leap-
ing forward lagging back in his
haste to save his bills espee forgot to
be careful he lost his footing lost
his handhold and plunged to the floor

  rentfro started to laugh but when
the conductor did not get up he
changed his mind jerry uttered a lit-
tle cry mike leaped down and helped
him to his feet he held to the grab-
iron and muttered  ouch my
ankle

  mike left him clinging to the iron
and ran to move the bills to safety
espee started hobbling toward his
chair mike took him by the shoul-
ders and jerry and rentfro came tum-
bling out of the cupola

  when sencil tugged at his shoe
mike had to pull it off the ankle
was not broken but it was dislocated
they induced sencil to lie down on the
bunk and rentfro held the leg and
mike set the ankle as best he could
when it was finished mike left jerry
and rentfro with the conductor and
he went back to the cupola to watch
the train

  there was no letup in the rain or
hail through it even when the light-
ning flashed over the tops of the
drenched freight cars mike could not
see more than six or eight of them

  he kept watching  all night the
gray snake which was the dry bed of
the puerco had lain off to his left
now as he looked he saw the gray
snake moving slowly at first then
faster and faster as more water poured
into it from creeks and arrovos out
of houcks they crossed black creek
it was a raging torrent with water al-
most to the rails

  jack rentfro kept worrying about
link and pin



crazy creek first it was  if
theres been as much rain on the head
of crazy creek as there was up on the
black that bridge may be gone and
a few miles more  i hope that fool
hoghead stops and takes a look at
crazy bridge before he starts over it

  but the  fool hoghead  was a new
man his fireman was also new and
so was his head brakeman they did
not know about crazy creek but they
did know they had a meet with an ex-
tra at navajo and that if they could
make it there by  they would not
have to go in the hole somewhere else
to let no  by them the boghead
trusted to luck and the railroad track
and kept batting the wind

  if espee had been in the cupola in-
stead of down there with a dislocated
ankle he might have done something
jack didnt jack was concerned but
he was not sufficiently so to fight his
way to the engine through the storm
over slick running boards he was in
the warm caboose and he stayed
there

twenty minutes ahead of no 
they came down on crazy creek
the fury of the storm had by now
abated somewhat it was still raining
but the rain had become a drizzle and
the lightning was behind them when
the engine was a hundred feet from
crazy bridge there came another flash
of lightning

  jack raised up in his seat and peered
ahead while he was still half on his
feet mike heard the whistle burst into
the scream for brakes he started to
his feet reaching for a club and the
conductors lantern the whistle broke
off in the middle of a short blast as if
it had been hit with a sledge hammer

  mike paused peered forward the
light was still in the sky he could see

the train ahead as bright as day he
saw the engine rise topple and disap-
pear and felt the caboose jerked vio-
lently ahead then he knew what had
happened they had come to crazy
creek

  rentfro left the cupola and half
leaped half fell to the floor mike did
not hurry he had been in tight spots
before he struck this one he stayed
until he saw the head car rear up and
plunge

  the car like the engine told the ca-
boose when it left the rails there
was a violent jerk followed by a slight
slowing and another jerk in quick
succession these movements were re-
peated

  mike knew that those cars held to-
gether by link and pin were going into
the ditch and each car unable to break
loose was taking the one behind it he
knew it was no use trying to brake the
outfit because brakes would not hold
them to the rails unless wreckage
filled the washout and made a bump-
ing post for the cars behind every car
was going in the river

  expecting rentfro to rush down
immediately and either cut off the ca-
boose from the train or drop a fusee
against no  he swung down from
the cupola rentfro was doing neither
he was shoving his way through the
mass of arms and legs where three in-
dians and two punchers had come alive
he was shouting  were in the ditch
weve got to jump jump for our
lives

  mike had seen the water all around
them he knew crazy creek had
piled up to the north and backwater
from the puerco on the south so that
they were riding a ridge between two
seas he seized rentfro and shouted
 you cant j ump  youll be
drowned


railroad stories

   well be drowned if we stay in this
caboose come on lets get off
here

  commanding the passengers to keep
their seats to keep out of the way and
not to jump mike darted to the rear
platform lighted a fusee and flung it
into the track he turned and started
back to the forward end intending to
cut off the caboose and stop it

  when he had passed the other eight
occupants he heard a terrific scream-
ing he whirled and ran back rent-
fro had jerry sencil in his arms and
was carrying her toward the rear door
she was kicking and fighting

  but rentfro was a madman mike
hesitated for a split second if he went
to pull the pin rentfro would jump
off the caboose into the flood before
he could get back if he went to
jerrys rescue he might be too late to
cut off the caboose and they might all
go into the flood to drown like rats
he ran to jerrys aid

  the girl struggled free rentfro
grabbed at the brake club lying be-
neath the cupola he did not use it
mike shoved jerry forward stepped
back and struck rentfro one short
quick uppercut at the point of the chin

  his knees crumpled and he went
down

  mike darted back to try the coup-
ling the caboose was jumping and
leaping so badly he could scarcely keep
his feet he flung the passengers out
of his way and darted to the platform
with each jerk the pin slackened he
grabbed it and pulled but did not get
it the first time he tried it again and
the pin leaped out

  he flung the pin away reached for
the brake wheel and spun it until the
chain tightened then he surged at it
until the brakes were taut he did
not know how many cars had already

gone from ahead of them there might
have been ten there might have been
twenty even now there might be a
scant six car lengths between them and
the washout

  mike called for help but he did not
call jack nor the puncher he shouted
jerry jerry bring me that club

  the girl heard and obeyed she
dashed to where the club had fallen
from rentfros limp hand and darted
back

  mike used the club and they stopped
eighty feet from the washout he did
not go down to see where the train and
four good men had gone no  was
behind them

  although he was not paid to do the
flagging he was a railroad man he
seized jacks guns and lamp and raced
through the shallow water which all
but covered the track and when he met
the train he brought it down coupled
it to the caboose and backed up to the
station

the cars on the prairie

it was three days before the bridge
was rebuilt a train came out ffom
winslow and jerry took her father
home on it mike went with them for
he was on his way to california but
he did not hurry out he stayed
around winslow two days

  under pretense of inquiring after
jerrys father he went to the house
she received him cordially ushered
him into her fathers room they
talked like old friends

  after awhile they began talking
about the country

   you should go into the hills north
link and pin



of holbrook and see the painted des-
ert jerry breathed her eyes kindling
 it is the grandest the most magnifi-
cent sight i have ever seen the colors
are marvelous-the reds the blues the
greens the grays never the same ever
changing under cloud and sun and
moon

  the only color mike had ever paid
much attention to was the red which
came up inside of him when railroad
workers got a raw deal nevertheless
he decelared  id love to miss sencil
id like nothing better than to go into
this desert of yours and see what it is
like

   why dont you suggested espee
 go down to the office and get them
to mark you up on the board it wont
hurt you to work here among us dead-
heads a little while ill be out of here
in a couple of weeks and we can pack
out of holbrook through the petrified
forests and swing back through the
painted desert its really worth the
half your life to see

  there was deep sincerity in the con-
ductors tone the girls eyes were ask-
ing mike felt the urge to stay but
there was his reference he doubted
whether he could get a job or keep one
for more than a few days if he did
when jerry had gone he confided his
fears to her father espee was seri-
ous

   ordinarily he said  you would
not have a chance in the world but
the way things have broken with offi-
cial attention already called to that deal
up at crazy creek you might be hired
for good

   i think id be wasting my time to
go down mr sencil

   its worth the try anyhow ill
give you a letter to charlie gasperson
hes the best official  ever worked
under

  mike presented himself to the brass
hat charlie gasperson was short red-
haired with keen blue eyes mike no-
ticed that he had lost two fingers and
that he wore the brotherhood emblem
on his lapel

  ordinarily mike was not nervous
it had mattered little whether he was
hired or turned down this time it was
different he hemmed and hawed

   im a trainman mr gasperson
he informed  id like to go to work
for the ap

   ive not been hiring men mr cor-
rigan gasperson said  but i reckon
a fellow can always hire one if he
wants to after that affair at crazy
creek i reckon the company owes you
something

  mike took the application blanks
but did not immediately begin filling
them out gasperson ket watching
him

  whats on your mind son he
finally asked

   its my reference mr gasper-
son mike stammered

   tell me about it

  mike told him

   you know the policy of this com-
pany corrigan but if youre willing
to buckle down here and do a job rail-
roading im ready to give you a
chance reference or no reference

mike stayed at winslow he
soon knew that despite his pos-
sessive attitude jack rentfro did not
have timecard rights with the conduc-
tors daughter jack was not even in-
vited on the three weeks pack trip
through the forest and the painted
desert by the time they came back
mike had a hunch that he was neither
going on to california nor going to let
his tongue make a fool out of him
again


railroad stories

  tilings rocked along smoothly dur-
ing the fall and early winter mike
worked off the extra board for a while
and when rentfro went up running he
took the vacancy on sencils car ex-
pecting to become parlor brakeman be-
fore many months had gone

  it was shortly after christmas that
trouble started there had never been
complete harmony among the four
railway labor organizations their in-
terests had not been in common op-
posing interest between the engineers
and firemen and between conductors
and trainmen brought jealousies

  one example of this opposing inter-
est was regarding seniority and pro-
motion naturally when a brakeman
or a fireman had hired out on any
given road he went to work with the
idea of being promoted when his turn
came to conductor or engineer com-
pany contracts with the older orders
called for employment of conductors
and engineers off other roads without
their having to go back and start at
the bottom the big question was this
should the company  make  all its
engineers and conductors or should it
hire part of them from other roads

  shrewd officials always fearful lest
the organizations might grow too
powerful were ready to take advan-
tage of these differences and use them
to keep the four organizations at outs
when trainmen made heavy demands
the companies made concessions to
conductors and because the conduc-
tors let the trainmen fight their own
fight the trainmen did likewise

  far-sighted labor leaders feared that
unless they could unite these orders un-
der one head it was only a question of
time until their whole force would be
disrupted failing to unite their next
move was to form another organiza-
tion whose aim was to bring all railroad

men under one banner it was in the
late winter that this new organization
the brotherhood of railway em-
ployees was formed

  this new organization was exactly
what mike corrigan had for years
worked and hoped for until a young
woman and an old conductor had
pulled the board in his face and headed
him into a blind siding he had been
preaching this very thing

  it was only natural therefore that
when the organizers came into win-
slow to begin quietly building up on the
ap they should seek out corrigan
they had his record they knew what
he had been doing they expected him
to throw in with them and help rally
disgruntled ones to their standard

  mike talked to sencil he had come
to have a lot of wholesome respect for
the old conductor

  you better lay off of em boy
the conductor advised  weve got
our organizations with good leaders
 but were not getting anywhere
were not doing anything we dont
believe in fighting we talk but we
wont strike

  sencil smiled

   a strikes a danged good club to
carry mike he said  but its a
danged poor one to fight with

   but if we pull a strike and win
it

   that ifs an awful big word right
there son if we pull our strike the
first thing the managements goin to
get is an injunction dont you ever
doubt that believe me theyjl get it
these federal courts dont decide
questions without askin the boys with
the dough thats why im in favor
of the strike only as a last resort

   but take this safety appliance
act look how long its taken to get
that through-six years and now five
link and pin



more years before it becomes obliga-
tory why in five years think how
many men-

   yeah i know but the thing of it
is we got it and we got it in such a
way that instead of losin friends
among the public weve won em be-
fore you can get anything like that
done youve got to educate the public
and the lawmakers now when we ask
for something else its goin to be a lit-
tle easier than it was this time

  although not fully convinced mike
went away pondering the question al-
most he was persuaded that the con-
servatives were right that the only way
labor would ever come to its own was
by the slow process which had re-
sulted in the passage of the hard-
fought safety appliance act al-
though he felt almost like a traitor to
his cause he did not join the brother-
hood of railway employees then he
might never have joined it had it not
been for p murphy scoggins

in january charlie gasperson was
transferred east and p murphy
wore the little brass hat into winslow
the first night he saw mike coupling
an engine to a string of reefers headed
east he bit the end off a cigar and al-
most choked on it plainly he had not
forgotten two black eyes in osawa-
tomie

  he strode up to the brakeman and
laid a heavy hand on the jumper sleeve

   what are you doin here corri-
gan he demanded

   supposed to be doin a job brakin
mr scoggins mike returned with a
laugh

   howd you get here

   i rode a freight in one night

   you know what i mean corrigan
how did you get a job without a ref-
erence

   on my face i reckon mr scog-
gins

   youre face aint good for a job
with me barked the new official

   ive been here six months already

   you wont be here three months
longer scoggins promised as he
strode to his office

  but mike wanted to stay in win-
slow longer than three months he
liked the job he liked the land and
he liked jerry he wanted to stay
but from the moment he heard scog-
gins voice he knew he would not do
so no man made many trips with-
out violating some rule for which he
could be discharged and the time
would soon come when the new official
would purposely catch him up

  one night in february espee took
out no  while mike was called out
of winslow on a drag east with extra
conductor barton he had three cars
of bricks for the wagon track in hol-
brook his engineer was mose kagle

  when the new organization had
come in trying to unite all railroad
men in one blanket brotherhood with
existing organizations as branches of
it mose had thought as many men
thought that such a plan would help
to protect their rights he had joined
them

   it looks like a good thing for all
of us kagle declared mike didnt
say much mike had done very little
talking since he come to a job with a
monthly pay envelope and a pair of
black eyes waiting for him he mildly
agreed it might be but he wasnt sure

  kagle eyed him keenly

   ive heard you used to favor such
an organization he said

   yes mike admitted  ive done
a lot of talking along that line i spent
three years hunting a job for running
off at the mouth when i was out


railroad stories

the boys who were in didnt worry
about me im going to worry about
myself a bit this time

 kagle said yeah i know
theres not been the protection there
should have been but this new outfits
goin to be different

   i hope so but im waiting to see
whether it is before i sign up

  they were running into holbrook
when mike said that he crossed to
the gangway to size up the wagon track
where his three cars of bricks were
going

  the wagon track was a spur track
then there was a switch at the east
end and five hundred miles of moun-
tain and desert at the other the track
held ten cars if someone shoved in
eleven the end one took to the coun-
try and had to have a big hook to put
it back on the iron

jack rentfro now conductor
had also gone east on a drag that
night he hauled three cars of lum-
ber for the wagon track at holbrook
hours before mike came with the
bricks jack had stopped to set out his
lumber

  jack had a student brakeman on the
head end to make sure nothing hap-
pened he himself rode the engine to
help get those cars into the spur he
was talking to engineer frank hilton
when they came into town and he for-
got to count the cars on the wagon
track it was now too dark to count
them without walking back by them

  he asked the student brakeman how
many cars were in the track

   six i think was the uncertain
answer

   arent you sure

  the student brakeman unaware that
the spur track ended in the desert de-
cided he was sure

   jack told him to cut off the lumber
cars while he himself opened the
switch the new man made the coup-
ling and they started shoving back on
the cars already there

  when two cars were in the clear
the swing mans light began to talk
it was saying  stop and saying it
with a big  s jacks light and the
students light too said  stop
frank hilton stopped they went
back to see what was wrong instead
of six cars in the spur there had been
ten and they had shoved two of them
out into the prairie

  jack went back to the engine
 weve sure played hell now he told
hilton

    whats the matter  hadnt that
nitwit counted those cars

    ill say he hadnt weve got two
of em off out there in the prairie i
reckon he added gloomily  this
means my job and yours

  hilton was an old hand he had
been in tight spots before and had got
out by oiling his tongue with brains
and not working it too much

    were not fired yet jack my boy
not by a danged sight he said

  then he proposed that instead of
leaving the cars in the spur track they
cut them off take them instead around
to the house track shove them into
clear couple up and leave town since
no one had seen them and since an en-
gine leaves no fingerprints they could
tell their tale and stand pat on it and
no trainmaster in the world could fire
them for shoving those cars off the
end of the spur

   that was what they did

  when mike got there the extra
conductor did not come to the head
end to help mike set out his bricks
mike had been railroading long enough
so that he didnt need a conductor fol-
link and pin



lowing him around to tell him what to
do and how to do it besides the
swing man nosed out a hot box on an
ore car three ahead of the caboose
and conductor barton stayed back to
help him brass and pack it

  mike watched the wagon track as he
ran in he counted the cars and he
knew there were ten he figured the
track should be full but when he got
to the switch he saw also that there
was room for two more in the east
end

   theyve either lengthened this
track or else somebodys shoved some
cars out of it he told kagle

   well for gosh sake lets find out
before we go in there urged the engi-
neer

  mike walked the track and came
back to the engine he was grinning

   somebodys sure put two of em
out in the desert he said

   what we goin to do about it 
queried kagle

  mike studied a minute he figured
the consignee might want to unload
bricks early in the morning since
there was room for two cars in the
wagon track he could see no reason
for taking all of them to the house

   well take two of them in here and
take one to the house he decided

   wed better take em all to the
house kagle objected  that offi-
cial outfits apt to try to hang it on us
for shoving those cars out

   well nail that right away mike
assured him  ill go back and tell
barton and he can report the matter
if it hasnt already been reported

  they set out the cars mike went to
the caboose barton and the swing man
had been brassing their journal they
had heard the engine go into the
wagon track come out and go to the
house mike told barton what had

happened and barton reported to the
dispatcher

scoggins knew when he got bar-
tons report on holbrook that he
had something on somebody if he
could only cinch it cars dont walk
off spur tracks unless somebody knows
about it his business was to find out
who knew he was certain from the
consist of trains going east that the
blame lay with either rentfros or bar-
tons crew

  he called rentfro in first with
frank hilton

   what do you know about those
two cars of flour that were shoved off
the wagon spur at holbrook night be-
fore last mr rentfro he asked
viciously

  rentfro did not flinch or flush he
looked straight into the official eye and
asked innocently what cars mr
scoggins 

   why did you not set those three
cars of lumber into the spur where
they belonged scoggins replied with
a question

  jack looked hurt and puzzled why
you see mr scoggins that track only
holds ten cars when we came in it
was full and so we took ours on to
the house

  you did eh

   sure jack answered

   did you see whether two cars had
been shoved off that track 

   why no  didnt mr scoggins
i just counted the cars

   thats all scoggins said

  he called hilton in asked about the
same questions and got about the same
answers convinced that this crew
was innocent he next called barton
barton had nothing to cover up he
had no story

  when scoggins asked who discov-


railroad stories

ered the cars off the track he replied
without hesitation  the head brake-
man corrigan

  corrigan eh rasped the official
 where were you while they were set-
ting out those cars 

  barton explained that he had been
helping the swing man brass a journal
scoggins then wanted to know what
moves the engine made it dawned on
barton that trouble was in the wind

   i think it went into the wagon
track and then on up to the house
he finally said  im not sure

   thats all mr barton

  he next called up mike and kagle
they told him what they had found
and how they had done their switch-
ing

   thats a good story boys the
official sneered  but it wont stick

   why wont it stick  barked
kagle

   because you fellows shoved those
two cars off the end of that track try-
ing to put your set out in there
why us mike demanded
 were we the only crew that used that
track that night

   apparently you were corrigan
if scoggins had not been looking for
a chance to fire corrigan he would
probably have marked the case  un-
able to fix responsibility put out a
threatening bulletin and let it drop
he didnt he fired both of them
gave barton ten days and closed the
case that is he thought he closed it

a trainload of brass hats

mike was furious injustice
stirred his memory he recalled
three years on the boomer trail re-

called all the mean things he had said
during those youthful years as an agi-
tator he decided now that he had
not said half of it

  he talked to sencil the old con-
ductor advised him to let the brother-
hood handle the case mike went to
the local chairman the chairman told
him to sit tight and promised to do
what he could

  kagle took his case to his brother-
hood although its leaders were not
half through organizing and in no
shape whatever to pull off a strike they
were anxious to try out their new
machine and see how it clicked they
heard kagles story they promised
immediate action and took the case to
the throne

  company officials backed scoggins
right or wrong they had to scog-
gins stood pat leaders of the new
brotherhood backed kagle and de-
clared that unless he was given immedi-
ate justice they would tie up the rail-
road

  kagle urged mike to join the new
brotherhood

   were going to bat with this
thing he declared stoutly  weve got
a case and weve got men enough be-
hind us to tie up this pike so tight a
snake cant crawl over it you line
up with us and youll be back working
within a week

  mike figured he was fired anyhow
remembering scoggins and osawa-
tomie he feared his brotherhood could
not help him he joined

  espee was upset  we know you
got a raw deal he admitted  but you
should have waited we were going
to get a re-hearing we would have
straightened the thing out peaceably
and you could have stayed on here
now youve tied our hands where we
cant do anything
link and pin



  mike did not have much to say
jerry was heartbroken

   why did you do it mike  she
sobbed

  i was out anyhow corrigan
argued  i made up my mind to fight
for my rights instead of laying down
like a whipped pup and letting that
heel-chewin toe-lickin blatherskite
run over me

  espee knew company officials fear-
ing the power of an organization of all
employees were waiting a chance to
deal it a death blow he knew that
the older orders fearing the baby
brother might drag them into difficulty
were also hoping it might die in in-
fancy

  in the first place age has always
been jealous of aspiring youth that
was one reason then the men who
worked for the ap were as a rule
pretty well satisfied with their treat-
ment by officials again they knew
the new order favored strikes

  it was easy to start a strike in 
the new organization issued its ulti-
matum it gave officials twelve hours
to reinstate kagle and corrigan offi-
cials ignored it members quit work
wheels stood still but they did not
stand still long old organizations and
business men stood by the company
and two days after the strike was called
it appeared certain that the cause was
lost that kagle and corrigan would
not only fail to be reinstated but the
men who had walked out in their be-
half also would be discharged

  then two strangers came into the
picture the strikers disclaimed them
though they posed as organization
men strikers declared afterward
they were hired by the company to stir
up trouble and discredit their cause

  trains began moving-irregularly
it is true but moving with members of

the old orders at the throttle the
strangers filtered among the strikers
urging them to do more than talk
they hatched schemes to destroy prop-
erty to injure workers to blow up
bridges and wreck trains

  mike and kagle grew uneasy they
were young neither had seen a real
live strike in action they did not
want this kind of strike but the two
men laughed at them they talked
and many listened liquor flowed
hard-eyed men gathered in knots in sa-
loons and on street corners murmur-
ing talking in undertones hushing
when unfriendly ears were near

  days passed rumblings grew mike
knew something was ready to break
he did not know what or when or
where in the afternoon he went to
sencils espee was east jerry ex-
pected him home on no  at midnight

  mike confided his fears to jerry

   you cant help it boy she told
him

   maybe not but i feel responsible
it was my job

   rats it was not your job mike
if youd never had a job this thing
would have come just the same there
was kagle and there was the new or-
ganization quit worrying about it
and lets go for a drive in the desert

  mike did not quit worrying he
had a hunch he should stay in town
and help keep the boys under control
he knew however that he could do
nothing with two agitators talking
fight talk to hard liquor he might as
well keep his mouth shut he went
for the drive

in the southwest spring is the time
of sandstorms winds whipping
dry earth from arid plains hurl and
churn it in dense clouds that spring
the sandstorms had already come to


railroad stories

arizona this evening however was
mild with a full moon showing a yel-
low disc against the haze in the east
mike and jerry crossed the tracks east
of town and headed southward

  in town the pair filtered among
despondent strikers they talked liq-
uor listened they watched the heavens
as the moon climhed higher a puff
of wind came and then another and
another by ii pm papers boards
and tin cans were hurtling down the
street and the wind howling and
screaming through every crack and
crevice was hurling sand eastward in
dense clouds

  when the blow came the two men
left the saloon and taking two other
strangers with them slipped cautiously
up toward the deserted roundhouse
where a switch engine and four road
hogs were under steam the wind
roared on they stooped low to keep
on their feet sand fog hid them from
prying eyes

  espee sencil came into holbrook
on first no  there was a private
car next the engine and four sleepers
behind it in the private car were
scoggins a master mechanic a division
superintendent a general manager two
vice presidents and representatives
from two of the old organizations
they were on their way out to try to
straighten the labor tangle either to
get strikers back to work or else fire
them and fill their places

  they stayed in holbrook twenty
minutes and the train left a half hour
late

  meanwhile mike and jerry drove
slowly they did not stop until they
had been riding two hours but they
stopped a long while then it was

	when they turned the team toward
home

  the first puffs of wind came when

they had gone a mile mike whipped
up the horses and drove rapidly until
the wind became so fierce and the dust
so dense he could not see the way he
then gave the horses their heads and
let them come home at their own rate

  wind howled dust fogged jerry
nestled close to him in the covered
buggy mike looked at his watch he
wanted to be home in time to pick up
sencil coming in with no  it was

	while he was holding the match
to the watch the horses stopped when
he threw the match away and his eyes
grew accustomed to the gray darkness
he could see that they had come to the
crossing the horses were stamping
and flicking their ears he wondered
why as he reached for the whip to
urge them across

  he did not use it for at that in-
stant he heard the soft rumble of an
exhaust blending with the roar of the
wind and storm since he could not
see a headlight he thought he must
have been mistaken then he heard
it again that steady whoosh-whoosh
of an engine running eight or ten miles
an hour

  soon the bulk of a locomotive
loomed out of the darkness it clanked
by not fifteen feet from him there
was no light in the cab no face at the
window mike looked at jerry who
was frowning and then he looked back
at the engine it had disappeared

  he was too dumfounded to act he
could not figure what an engine had
been doing out here without a head-
light then he remembered the two
agitators and a lot of strike and wreck
talk he also remembered that no 
was almost due that espee sencil was
on it and that jerry was going to meet
him he seized the whip and lashed
the horses into a gallop

  on the way in he confided his sus-
link and pin



picions to jerry she did not say
much he drove straight to the office
flung the lines to her and told her to
wait until he came back

  before he went in he sized up the
yard through the darkness he could
see an engine on track  it was wait-
ing to take no  east as he went up
the stairs he met kagle and no s
conductor kagle yelled to ask about
his hurry

  he did not answer but darted to the
dispatchers desk

   well whats the matter with
you the dispatcher demanded

  mike explained the dispatcher
scoffed but soon he quit scoffing and
thought while he was thinking the
roundhouse reported that somebody
had stolen a switch engine off the
cinder pit

the dispatcher got busy then
with all the brass hats on his rail-
road headed for a head-on collision
with a loose engine it was time to get
busy he called the conductor wait-
ing to take out no 

   theres a wild engine loose east
of here he groaned  its heading
right into the face of three grab
your engine and overtake it before they
hit

   cant growled the conductor
 hogheads up at the lunch counter
 get him and go threes been out
of joseph city since-

   youve not got time to get him
mike interrrupted  use kagle hes
right outside

  the dispatcher didnt debate long
he yelled  get out

  mike got out grabbing kagle as he
went kagle had a stubborn streak
in him he declared he was fired for
a second mike thought he was not go-
ing

  kagle was stubborn but he was no
fool he knew that a wreck which
could be laid at the door of striking
union men would do his organization
more harm in a minute than it could
undo in twenty years he dashed to-
ward the waiting engine mike opened
the switch kagle worked cylinder
cocks reverse and throttle the high-
wheeled passenger engine stepped away
from the station and roared into the
night

  dust and sand laid a receding cur-
tain over the track ten feet beyond
their headlight its rays were lost in
the dense fold the curtain was ahead
but the men knew that just behind it
a switch engine was chugging up the
slight grade and beyond the switch
engine a passenger train was roaring
down making time where the engine
where the train they did not knew

  mike and kagle reckoned the wild
engine had come over the crossing at

	mike had guessed its speed
at ten miles an hour it was now 
the engine should have gone five miles
kagle took the chance and advanced
speed to forty miles an hour it seemed
a thousand

  fives miles out he slowed to thirty
mike started through the front cab
window

   where you goin  kagle asked
him

  to the pilot where i can look and
listen

   youd better stay inside if we
hit that goat with you out there there
wont be a grease spot left of you

  but he went to the pilot the odor
of coal smoke came to his nostrils and
he knew that locomotive was not far
away he was glad this passenger en-
gine had air brakes he remembered
how for years he had talked and fought
for them he swung his lantern to a

slow sign kagle obeyed the engine
drifted-twenty-five twenty the gap
should now be closing

  mike peered ahead then the shape
loomed out of the dust fog-a dim
shape darting closer drawing relent-
lessly upon him he shouted loud and
swung to a stop sign the brakes took
hold

  air brakes checked the speed he
stood poised on the platform the
drawbars crashed together in the in-
stant they struck mike leaped for the
grab iron on the switcher the impact
of the engine striking from behind
shot it forward his arms almost came
from their sockets and his fingers
slipped on the steel he clung for life
as his feet dangled then he found
a step and he scrambled over the
tender and into the cab

  he had already known what he
found the engine was deserted her
throttle cracked reverse up boiler hot
and full of water he closed the throt-
tle when kagle came to take charge
mike grabbed torpedoes and fusees and
sprinted up the track to flag no 

next morning the town was full
of rumors everybody was talking
except the men who knew they were
keeping mum

  they were still keeping mum when
mike and kagle invited by scoggins
went to the office it was full jack
rentfro was there squirming and star-
ing sullenly at the toe of his shoe
frank hilton was there grinning
proud sponsors for the infant brother-
hood were also there and staid repre-
sentatives of older ones and more
brass hats than the two road men had
ever seen together

  a bearded high-hat opened the ses-
sion by explaining that due to mis-
statements of certain employees certain

other employees had been unjustly dis-
charged from their position

  he went on to say that in the light
of this information his company
deemed it only just and right that the
men so discharged should be restored
to their positions with full pay for all
time lost

  the stranger then cast his eyes upon
the brakeman and the engineer

   are you ready to return to work
under those conditions he queried

  mike looked at kagle and kagle
looked at mike

  how about the other fellows
mike asked

   oh the boys who-who laid off
work for a few days

  mike grinned at kagle nodded yes
to the official

   their case has been handled sat-
isfactorily to all concerned the offi-
cial assured him

   in that case im ready to go back
to work and let the matter drop mike
answered quietly

   same here boomed kagle

  officials remained inside men
came out on the platform where
spring sunshine smiled and soft wind
played with drifted sand they stopped
to review the investigation

   by gosh it was kagle drawing
a folded check through his fingers who
spoke  ive seen something today that
i never expected to see

   whats that mike queried

  the answer came quickly

over plain and moun-

instead of battling
death on reeling icy
top would sit comfort-
ably in cab and cupola where a touch
of the hand would set brakes as if by
magic no more rushing out to obey
the dreaded call no more darting be-
tween cars to lift a link or drop a pin

the next day sencils crew was
called on an orange drag east
shortly after noon jerry went down
to the caboose with mike and her
father she was chatting with mike
while he cleaned his markers

he coupled onto
the caboose and
backed up to tha
station

   jerry blushed and they both looked
around p murphy scoggins was
standing in the open door grinning
he sauntered in he beamed on mike
and jerry asked her jokingly

mike answered for her  only a

jerry turned a deeper crimson
scoggins chuckled and laid a hand on

railroad buys mine to prevent mining

the only recorded purchase of a mine in order to prevent
the mining of coal has just been announced the london
midland  scottish ry of great britain recently bought an im-
portant mine one of whose principal veins passed beneath its
tracks between nuneaton and tam worth in staffordshire the
companys object was to prevent the mining of coal and conse-
quent weakening of its roadbed mining carried on in this vein
caused railroad authorities to limit train speeds through the area
to  miles per hour which led to a two minutes delay of every
train now that mining is stopped the mine has been filled up
and shut off trains have returned to their normal speed of  to  miles per hour

special freight cars for  de luxe hoboes 

now that spring is here hikers in france are getting a lucky break the french
state railways have turned over a large number of box cars for the use of en-
gine-picture fans gypsies hoboes and other wanderers who can afford to hire them
these cars are painted white inside and out and fitted with cook stoves and hooks
for hanging hammocks for only  francs  a day they are rented to parties
of not less than six and not more than ten per car regardless of sex and may travel
anywhere in france for the additional price of a third-class ticket the  de luxe
hoboes  can have their freight cars attached to fast passenger trains and travel in
speed as well as comfort north american railroads that desire to popularize their
passenger traffic would do well to adopt this idea

j  farr had already turned
in his resignation

   there isnt enough money in railroad-
ing he said  im quitting the road and
going into business so he was he and
his wife had been saving money for years
to open a store in atlantic city selling
souvenirs and novelties on august first
the very peak of the season they were
opening the store

  the boys in the engine house at cam-
den n j wished him the best of luck
eddie farr was popular and had been in
engine service on the reading since june
 on one occasion he had been laid
off for two weeks for not making time on
the run between philadelphia and atlantic
city but tonight hed bring no  the
philadelphia express into atlantic city on
the dot the timetable said  and 
it would be

year later a new atlantic type baldwin

 minutes-at the rate of  miles

   	r

per hour that made the  the fastest
locomotive in the world in her day but
on july st  the -minute run was
considered pretty good especially as the
boys usually shaved two or three minutes
off the schedule

  farr climbed into the cab in the dingy
camden terminal and at  he opened
the throttle for his final trip starting
three minutes late was not unusual

  in the cab with farr was another engi-
neer who was going to take over his run
the following day and his fireman tom
ohoulihan

  nobody knows just what farr was
thinking of that fatal day but there can
be no doubt that his mind was occupied
with subjects which had little to do with
his duties as a locomotive engineer may-
be he was regretting his retirement maybe
the thoughts of his new store were upper-
most in his mind

  farrs only extended words on the whole
trip were spoken to his fireman at ham-
monton a little more than halfway be-
tween philadelphia and atlantic city
they stopped here for a half minute and
it was here that farr made a remark about
the fire none of the three men in the cab
said anything about the fact that they
were still three minutes late

railroad stories

  in those days travel between philadel-
phia atlantic city and intermediate points
was maintained by three railroads two
of them were in the pennsylvania system
namely the west jersey  seashore and
the camden  atlantic the third the
atlantic city railroad was part of the
reading

  those three lines ran out of the coast
resort on two nearly parallel tracks the
two pennsy roads left one station and
crossed the same bridge while the reading
used a station about eight blocks below
and crossed a drawbridge of its own a few
hundred yards below the other bridge

  after crossing the bridge the two pennsy
roads were obliged to cross over the double-
tracked reading line at grade this inter-
section was marked by the meadow tower
 miles from the readings atlantic city
terminal after passing this tower north-
bound the west jersey tracks paralleled
the readings and went on to the main line
of the camden  atlantic

  in brief the west jersey trains had to
cross the reading tracks in order to con-
nect with the c  a this crossover was
in a swampy section known as  the mead-
ows the reading permitted the crossing
of their tracks by virtue of an agreement
with the pennsy dated june nth 
but normally gave their own trains the
right of wray at that point this dangerous
crossing was protected by a signal tower
and the rule providing that all engines and

trains approaching the crossing had to be
prepared to come to a full stop  feet
from the crossing unless the signal of right-
of-way was displayed

  the signals were electrically controlled
and it was impossible for the towerman to
give two trains a  come ahead  signal at
the same time the normal position of the
semaphore whenever a train approached
always indicated danger if the operator
gave it a white board the  highball  in
those days all the other levers were locked
automatically at red it wtas utterly im-
possible for a towerman even though he
were drunk or half asleep to give more
than one train a clear signal at any time

  the signal could be seen clearly more
than a mile away and a train running at
fifty miles per hour could be stopped with-
in  feet of any point where the brakes
were applied under the rules it was the
towermans duty to give a reading train
the right-of-way unless a west jersey
train should ring the bell first and pro-
vided that he had no exact knowledge of
the position of the reading train

on the st of july  nicholas
long held the day trick at meadow
tower and george f hauser succeeded
him on night duty hauser was a small
slightly-built man twenty seven years old
he had been working in that tower for
only a month

  hauser arose at noon on the st

the famous  on the atlantic city railroad forty years ago she was the worlds fastest
locomotive often making  mph on the camden-atlantic city run she had  and  by
-inch cylinders and -lnch drivers rebuilt to no  about  with smaller drivers and

simple cylinders scrapped in

meadow tower and crossing scene of wreck	engr edward farr

strolled to the beach and hung around
some of the boardwalk refreshment saloons
for about three hours although he main-
tained later that he did not drink anything
stronger than soda pop that night at
 he reported for duty at the tower
he greeted the day man who completed
his train sheet and left three minutes later

  leisurely the night man took off his coat
and vest-it was a warm evening-and
hung them in a closet as he turned from
the closet the west jersey railroad indi-
cator rang notifying him of the approach
of a southbound train hauser looked at
the clock saw that the reading express
was due in three minutes then he peered
down and saw the west jersey train ap-
proaching it happened to be a little late
and the reading was not yet due so he
gave the west jersey the right-of-way at
the crossover

  the west jersey train no  was the
first section of an excursion of seven
coaches carrying some  members of the
improved order of red men and their
families most of the excursionists had
come from bridgeton and other near-by
points in southern new jersey they had
just settled themselves for the homeward
trip when the train pulled into the
meadows

  this first section which had been sched-
uled to leave at  was a few minutes
late in getting under way after crossing
the drawbridge no  was halted near
meadow tower to wait for two other trains
this delay caused the collision

engineer farr home bound on
his final run had the throttle wide
open to make up lost time he was fa-
miliar with the crossover but he knew that
the reading towerman usually gave read-
ing trains the right-of-way

  ohoulihan testified later that while
crossing the meadows he the fireman saw
a train going ahead of them on the paral-
leling camden  atlantic tracks it was
the firemans duty to ring the bell to an-
nounce to the tower man the coming of
no  and he did so at that time he
was in the tender shoveling coal to see
ahead he would have been obliged to put
his head out one side so he did not ob-
serve until two whistles were blown that
the west jersey excursion was coming to-
ward him and that nothing could stop
them now from meeting on the crossover

  in that instant farr noticed apparently
for the first time that hauser had set the
red board against the reading train farr
saw that he had lost the race to the cross-

over but now it was too late to do any-
thing about it without a wrord he  wiped
the clock tom ohoulihan made a wild
dive out of the gangway just before the
collision but farr stayed at his post

  the reading engine plowed into the
second passenger coach of the excursion
with terrific force at an angle of about
thirty degrees cutting the train clean in
two and smashing the coach to bits noth-
ing was left of that car but a mass of tan-
gled splinters and twisted steel in which
were mixed the bodies of wounded and
dead victims and their belongings

  to add to the horror of the catastrophe
the boiler of farrs engine exploded almost
immediately deluging many of the passen-
gers with scalding water and live steam
then the engine toppled into the marsh

john greiner engineer of the ill-
fated red mens special took his un-
damaged locomotive back to the round-
house in camden shortly after midnight
and gave thi version of the story

   my train left atlantic city at 
pm she was about two minutes late when
we reached the drawbridge just as we
were leaving the drawbridge i looked out
of one of the cab windows and saw the
reading express traveling to atlantic city
a camden  atlantic train was running in

the same direction and the two trains
seemed to be racing

   looking up at the tower i saw that i
had a clear track the signals are inter-
locking and the fact that the white was
against me would throw the red against the
reading express as the express came
thundering upon the crossing i saw that a
collision was unavoidable

    my god horace i said to my fire-
man  hes not going to stop

   then i left my seat and hurried on to
the engines steps for an instant i was
undecided whether to jump or not some-
thing seemed to prevent me from jump-
ing-it may have been a hunch i sprang
quickly into the cab again the next min-
ute the collision came had i followed
my first impulse and jumped i would have
been crushed to death

  calls for jhelp were sent to atlantic city
and large quotas of policemen firemen
doctors and railroad wrecking hands soon
appeared on the scene together with a very
large number of spectators who pressed into
service all sorts of vehicles which cluttered
the highway and impeded the efforts of the
rescuers police had to beat back the curi-
osity seekers with clubs

  pathetic reminders of a happy day spent
at the shore were found among the debris--
childrens shovels spades and sand moulds

  the reading engine was a mass of scrap
iron and rubbish piled up with a smashed
car and partly buried in the soft black
mud from this mass the body of engi-
neer farr was taken just as the gray of
dawn was showing in the east it was with
difficulty that his tightly clenched fingers
were pried loose from the throttle and air
brake-for he had died at the throttle like
the heroic engineers of song and story by
a strange freak of fate he himself was a
member of the improved order of red
men whose excursion he had crashed into

  the other runner in the cab who was
to have taken over farrs run on august
first also perished in the wreck

at coroner mclaughlins inquest a few
days later witnesses testified that the
two trains had been racing to the cross-
over george hauser the towerman look-
ing pale and worn from brooding over the
tragedy said he had given the clear track
to the excursion train when he saw that
the flier was a mile or more away

  he insisted that farr had plenty of time
in which to stop his train if he had tried
to do so  i heard no sound of the read-
ing train putting on brakes he declared

   trains at crossings hauser pointed
out  are governed by signals and not by
schedules or anything else even if a train
is behind time the towerman is expected
to use his own judgment in deciding
whether or not it is to be given the right-
of-way i looked in both directions before
giving the signals these signals can be
seen for a mile and a half

the wreck cast a pall on atlantic citys vacation season boardwalk beach and amusement
pavilions were deserted thousands gathered to watch the wrecking crews at work sketch

does the piston of a forward-running loco-
motive move backward when it slides to-
ward the rear end of the cylinder or does it
always move forward-a s trenton n j

  assuming that you define movement in relation
to the ground over which the locomotive passes
the piston of a forward-running locomotive always
moves forward even when it is in the middle of
its backward stroke obviously if it is to move
backward in relation to the ground it must cover
a distance about equal to half the circumference
of the driving wheel since during the course of
a single stroke the driver makes a half revolution
the specifications of most locomotives show that
during a single stroke of one of their pistons they
move a distance at least three times as great as
the stroke and hence the piston can never move
backward in relation to the ground while the
engine is running forward a moments thought
will tell you that no engine could be built to
the stroke of the piston
longer than the drivers
is considerably less than

work otherwise since
cannot very well be
diameter which itself
half its circumference

 does the size  the locomotives they operate
 have anything to do with the wages engine-
 men are paid-w r drayton n d

 yes wages sometimes vary as much as 
 according to the weight of the locomotive on
 the principle that it takes more out of the men
 to operate the heavier machines see page 
 of last julys issue for a list of sample wage rates

 what is meant by tractive force

  is engine  of the m-k-t still in
 service-j m n y

 	it is a convenient rating of the engines
 pulling power but since it is calculated from the
 engines dimensions it gives the pulling power
 developed at the rims of the driving wheels when
 the locomotive is starting its load the force
 which the engine exerts in moving the train
 drawbar pull obviously is less since it uses some
 of its tractive force to start itself and tender
 a oo-ton motive power unit for example re-
 quires almost  lbs of force to start moving

 	according to our records yes

i have noticed that ike new atlantic types
the milwaukees hiawatha cpr  have
llieir main rods connected with the first set of
drivers but that the older ones have theirs con-
nected to the second what is the advantage of
the former arrangement-w m chicago

  connecting the main rod to the first set of
drivers on a four-coupled engine is not particularly
new since not only were all the old --s so
connected but some of the older atlantic types
as well the santa fe for example is still using
many of them this practice produces a smoother-
running and better-riding machine and it obvious-
ly reduces the weight of the reciprocating parts

probably the only reason that some of the older
atlantics are connected to the rear set of drivers
was the fact that the drivers were too far for-
ward to permit anything else

are there any characteristics besides the wheel
arrangement which designate the type of a
locomotive

   for what reasons were engines given their
wheel arrangement-a w chicago

  	what you probably want to know is
whether or not there are locomotive typefi based
on characteristics other than wheel arrangement
the answer is that there are to a limited extent
but that they are not nearly so important as
wheel arrangement we have compound and sim-
ple types superheated and saturated types fire-
tube and water-tube types and lots of other types
none of them however identify a locomotive so
completely and tell so much about it as its wheel
arrangement thus it is logically the ideal standard
for classifying engines

  	to answer this adequately would demand
a history of the locomotive and we havent room
for even a brief one here years ago we printed
a pictorial history of the locomotive called  the
development of the locomotive  which answered
your query to a certain extent but the issues in
which it appeared are no longer available we
suggest you look up material in your library on
the subject situated in a large city you should

he wood-burning locomo-

rugged pioneer railroad the
ogdensburg  lake cham-
plain which ran from og-
densburg to rouses point on lake
champlain disappeared during my boy-
hood the seven years from 
when the substitution of steel for iron
rails began to  when it had been
completed and when coal-burning loco-
motives had superseded the wood-
burners were packed with thrills for
boys who lived at lawrence my home
town now north lawrence besides
being a wood station lawrence was an
important live stock shipping point and
the site of the last of the rail repair
shops maintained at several points for
the repair of iron rails

  we boys of lawrence found abun-
dant opportunities for  riding on the
cars  and picking up a good practical
knowledge of railroading at first hand
to get to actually know and speak to an
engine driver to ride on the firemans
seat was aiming high but i made it and
became a persistent train and engine
rider from my tenth to my fifteenth
year when i was packed off to an
academy i have forgotten much of
what i learned in the academy but all
that i learned from the trainmen con-
ductors firemen and engineer the rail
repair shops and live stock yards has
stuck in my memory like a burr

  of course i was in a preferred posi-
tion for my father and his brothers
were large shippers of live stock be-
sides furnishing a substantial part of


railroad stories

the wood used in the locomotives i
remember hearing brother say in the
early os

   with only thirty-odd engines the
o  l c bought over  cords of
wood last year that would make a
pile seventy miles long i hope the road
does not turn to coal-burning engines
soon but they are bound to come most
of the roads are using coal now they
all started with wood-burning engines
except the b  o and even that road
had a few wood-burners

   how did you find out about that
 from abraham klohs superinten-
dent at malone he keeps pretty close
track of all that is going on in the rail-
road world some time within the next
ten or a dozen years mr averell the
new president will bring in coal they
can carry it to ogdensburg by water
besides he has a new son-in-law named
e h harriman who they say has a
lot of up-to-date ideas about railroad-
ing mr averell has got him on as a
director of the o  l c i hope he
turns out to be as good a railroad man
as the old-timers

  that was the first time i heard the
name of edward h harriman his
directorship of the o  l c must have
been one of his earliest if not indeed
his first

but i was not concerned with rail-
road officials engineers and con-
ductors were more to my liking up to
 i had never ridden in a locomotive
except in a switching engine and that
somehow- didnt count the swell loco-
motive of the o  l c was the  w
j averell named after the roads
president she was a beauty she was
brass-bound and her bell shone like
silver her cow-catcher with its two
brass sockets to hold hags the leather
seats in her cab the big tender piled
high with the sweet smelling -inch
blocks of seasoned maple and beech
wrood from my fathers wroods and last
and most important of all watson
hunkins her massive and kindly engi-
neer wrere eye-filling and awe-inspiring

  i	resolved that i would not only ride
in the  averell but it would be some-
thing more than what we called a
 siding ride i would ride to the next
station and come home on the local
freight that would be something

  craftily i followed my campaign a
few days later when the  averell 
was being refueled or  wooded  as
we said i sidled up to watson hun-
kins ready to swing up to his throne

   hello mr hunkins i ventured

   why hello what you doing down

it is but i havent any money with me
 they aint for sale mr hunkins
im going to give them to you

  oho what you driving at

  i felt that i had hit a bulls eye to
be addressed by my nickname by wat-
son hunkins was almost as good as
riding in the  averell

   well mr hunkins i want to ride
on the firemans seat to the next sta-
tion and i want you to fix it so i can
come home in the caboose of the local
freight

  then my heart sank i got stage
fright and was almost ready to run for
home a half-grave half-humorous
look from the great hunkins eye
perked me up

   here give me that basket and up
you go into the cab but look here
wattie both of us may catch it for this
what do you suppose old man averell
would do to me if he heard of it and
what do you suppose your ma will do
to you if you get home late for supper
they say she doesnt approve of us

chances with the old man in ogdens-

with your ma

  that ride took just fifteen minutes
but every fraction of a second in those
few minutes was packed with a thrill
the fireman continuously stoked a
steady stream of wood blocks going in-
to the firebox the  averell  was
some wood-eater and i began to un-
derstand that -miles wood pile my
father talked about in the years that
 r

have passed since then i have ridden
countless thousands of miles with the
great and the near-great in my capacity
as a newspaper man but my ride in the
 averells  cab with my hero wat-
son hunkins stands out in memory over
them all at the station hunkins helped
me out of the cab and went into the
station for orders he came out with
an order in his hand

   im sorry for you boy the local
is held up a couple of miles west of here
with a hot box or something youll be
an hour late getting home and youll
get a darned good licking

   well it was worth it id take a
licking any day for such a grand ride
thats the ticket but now come
to think of it i believe i can fix it so
you wont get a licking your dad owns
those big wood lots everyone is trying
to buy wood lots so as to furnish wood
for the railroad well here is a little
secret that may save him a lot of
money old man averell has bought
two moguls-the biggest sort of en-
gines theyre coal-burners they are
coming from the rhode island loco-
motive works and will be delivered in
a few weeks in a year and a half there
wont be a wood-burner left and all the
wood lot owners will have to depend
on maple sugar your pa wont be glad
to hear that but he can sell out his
wood lots to the speculators and let
them do the worrying

  it was long after dark when i
reached our kitchen door my father
and mother were in the dining room
waiting my return the station agent
knew all about my adventure and had
told them to divert attention from my
misdemeanor i rushed almost breath-
lessly into the room

   theyre going to take off the wood-
burners and use coal-two new coal-
burning engines coming next month

and soon theyll all be burning

  that was real news-big news to
my father he had been a bull on wood
lots now he switched to the bear side
and finding a ready sale for his wood
lots sold them

  in the summer of  the two mo-
guls arrived as predicted by hunkins

up to that time we like all our neigh-
bors burned wood in our home in
 we too switched to coal in the
house as did the others with coal

we had ever managed to get through

t would be obviously unfair
to attempt to compare rail-
road men of today with rail-
road men of the gay nine-
ties for railroading today is
as different from railroading of the
gay nineties as are the telephone and
the automatic signals different from the
old morse and order board

but we old-timers who can look back
to the good old days love to kid our-

selves into thinking that we did a pretty
good job of railroading with nothing
but rails cars engines and nerve to
work with the old single track the
straight dispatching the switching of
air cars ahead the old hand brakes the
link-and-pin-couplings-all were pretty
crude but they managed to do a lot of
work just the same and the men
well those old-time roughneck cuss-
ing fellows somehow got there and got

back and the regular fellows were
not all on the lower rungs of the ladder
many of the brass collars were just
about as regular as any of the men un-

  take the old denver  rio grande
say in  on the first division den-
ver to salida  miles there were to
be found almost every kind of railroad-
ing except the simple kind the alti-
tude was  feet at denver at
palmer lake  miles away it was
 feet colorado springs  miles
from denver was  feet and pu-
eblo  miles from denver was 
feet pusher engines were required
from castle rock to palmer lake and
from husted to palmer lake all had
to be returned to the place whence they
came and that meant each pusher had
to run light and as an extra with 
orders

  j j burns was superintendent at
pueblo handsome smiling and ge-
nial he was always a gentleman he
was the superintendent however and
ran his division as it should be run
trainmaster j m walker was a fit
companion for him-efficient pleasant
and competent the chief dispatcher
was a different sort he was a hard
taskmaster disliked by most of the
boys he simply did not have it in him
to be anything but a dictator he fired
men right and left and it was one of
the banes of his existence that most of
them were put back to work by mr
burns

  one dull day mr burns was in the
dispatchers room with not much of an
excuse for being there our discussion
was about trainmen

   there are some conductors who
simply will not be laid out said one

they keep on going

   oh i dont know piped up burns
 a good dispatcher can lay anyone out
if he sets his mind to it-and fre-
quently when he has no intention of do-
ing so do you know any conductors
that cannot be laid out

   came back with

   you bet i do there are several
of them mort suiter for instance
or ed ellis right here on this division
they go in spite of hell

   well some time when one of them
happens to be out call me and i will
show you how to lay em out smiled
mr burns

   all right mort suiter is east-
bound on an extra right now he is
just out of colorado springs he has
a drag and here and now is a good
chance for you to show us how it is
done

  burns sat down at the key and called
pikeview he sent an order telling
suiter to go in on a blind siding where
there was no means of communicating
with headquarters and wait there for
an extra west it was simple except
there was no extra west for him to
wait for he was tied up for fair but
in those days a conductor had to use
or lose his head

   now said burns lets see him
get out of that leave him in the hole
awhile and then call me and i will show
you how to get him out then he
went back to his office

  two hours later he was sent for
entering the dispatchers office he
said  getting nervous

   oh no was the answer  num-
ber twelve came along and suiter put
a flag on her and is following her into
palmer lake now show us just how
you would go about it to lay that bird
out

  well burns was stumped he had to
admit mort suiter was pretty good


railroad stories

riding the freight

 by james c southcott

am sitting beside an open
window in my lonely hall
bedroom smoking my pipe
and thinking the wail of a
locomotive whistle pierces the
night maybe it comes from a new
hudson type pulling a string of pull-
mans out along the iron trail or may-
be from a freight hog steaming out of
the yards with a mile-long freight drag
bound for god knows where to me
that engine whistle is not merely a
sound but the call of adventure what
memories it brings back throwing
them like pictures upon the sensitive
screen of my mind   

  lying in the fresh spring grass on
the outskirts of some  hostile  town
at the end of the yards waiting for a
manifest hot-shot the train is made
up down there in the maze of tracks
but the road engine is not yet in sight
hours seem to pass as you watch and
wait it is a fine warm night from
the lake nearby is wafted a chorus of
baby frogs croaking with the joy of
new life the moon like a lamp sheds
a soft white radiance over all throw-
ing some objects into sharp relief and
others into inky shadow

  a sudden breeze blows off the lake
rustling through the trees and grass
down in the yards lanterns bob about
like fireflies a switch engine snorts up
and down her side-rods clanking and
a series of dull bangs and crashes de-
notes the making-up of a train per-
haps they are still at work on the red-
ball your train

  ah whats that you tense all
alert straining eyes and ears from
far down the track is heard a low hum-
ming like that of a giant tea-kettle
that sound can mean but one thing a
road engine a dazzling white eye ap-
pears throwing a sliver of brilliance
down the track-an eye that grows in
size and brilliance each moment then
a muffled crash and you know shes
coupled onto the string

  the freight may be  hitting the
ball  by the time she reaches the spot
where you are so youd better be ready
from the big jack come four long
blasts of the whistle then two short
 highball the humming changes
into a roar and hiss of steam the
squat stack of the road giant emits the
bark of her exhaust

  you crouch in the deep shadow of
a bush the bulls may be riding the
manifest out and you take no chances
of being seen you wait until the en-
gine has passed enveloping you in a
warm haze of steam from the cylinders
then you stand up and measure the
train as she slides by

  now you run out onto the cinders
beside the track for a moment you
stand getting set like a runner before
the gun

  being a red-ball there will be no
empties so it means riding the decks
or else a tank-car flat or gondola-if
there are any such in the string

  better grab her now the hogger is
beginning to ball the jack you run
with the train careful of your footing
as well as youre able in the darkness
true tales of the rails



you make a grab at a ladder-and
miss stumbling you fall on your
hands and knees-clear of those death-
dealing wheels thank heaven-but
rise quickly

  then another grab for a ladder-the
train is really moving now this time
your hand closes round the cold clam-
my steel and holds your feet leave
the ground and slam into the iron stir-
rup youve made it

  after hanging there a moment to get
your breath you climb the side ladder
to the deck at last you reach the top
the wind tears at you as the cars lurch
and gather speed in sudden jerks the
big jack up ahead is settling down to
the job of going places

  well youre aboard and lucky to
have made it she was going almost too
fast now to find a place to sleep far
too windy up here on the cinder-swept
tops there must be a flat gondola or
even a tank-car down the train aways
you stand up your trouser legs and
coat flapping in the wind and you start
walking toward the rear of the train
jumping the black chasms between the
cars

  one thing to remember look out
for bridges if youve been over that
section of track before you know the
lay of the land fairly well but if not
keep your eye peeled for over-passes
when youre taking a promenade over
the lurching swaying decks of a fast
freight

  at last about eighty cars back you
find a flat car a haven from the wind
descending by the end ladder of the
box car from which you sighted your
 find you pick a nice place where you
can lie down and sleep

  the lights of a small town flash by
and up ahead the whistle screams
warning to crossings what music to
the vagabond soul lulled by the roar

of the train the swaying of the car and
the rhythm of the wheels you doze off
into deep untroubled slumber    the
train rolls on  

  if you are lucky you see the glorious
flush of dawn creeping over the hills
sunrise on the road thrills you it fills
your soul with exultation

  by and by you realize that you are
hungry and you fish around among
your scant belongings for the package
of sandwiches and can of soup you got
at the greasy spoon the night before
while you are leisurely eating break-
fast speeding along smoothly on a
four-track pike another train running
in the same direction races your freight
and gradually overtakes you

  she proves to be a crack limited with
shiny new pullmans and a dining car
the latter pulls up to your flat and for
a while she keeps pace with you neck
and neck you stop munching the sand-
wich to watch the swells eating in the
diner right beside you a fellow and a
girl-they look like newlyweds-grin
at you with understanding that makes
the whole world kin

   gee its great to be alive on a beauti-
ful spring morning as the rail joints
click under you the flying cinders beat
a merry tattoo and the landscape
rushes past-orchards abloom in flam-
ing pink and white the dogwood trees
with petals like snow the purple lilacs
and wisteria dairy maids milking the
cattle birds from the southland wheel-
ing overhead young colts frisking in
the pasture and farmers beginning the
days plowing as the train roars on  

  these pictures from the gallery of
memory come to me now in my lonely
hall bedroom after hearing a locomo-
tive whistle pierce the night

true tales of the rails



broken links

by highball

orking in a chicago
yard long years ago in the
old link-and-pin age of
railroading was a yard-
master who was shy the
thumb on his right hand despite his
handicap however he always used his
maimed hand to give trick signals to
new yard men he would come hot-
footing out of the yard office touch the
top of his old cap with his right hand
and then hold the top of his old cap
with his right hand up in the
air and his fingers spread this
might mean to head in on either
track  or  generally a new man
would go for track  whereupon the
bull of the yards would let a bellow out
of him paw up some cinders and repeat
his gymnastic performance

  thereupon the hogger would give
his regular spiel  that bird he
would tell the new man  is shy the
thumb on his right hand and he only
uses it to give track four signals he
uses his left hand for track five

   what the sam hill does he expect
a man to do was the usual retort

 chase around through the yard to
count the fingers he has left every time
he pinches a few off

	 

one cold winters day a young road
runner was hitting the ball in the
grain yard batting out fast ones for the
yard men to catch and tie down when
both injectors on the old goat refused
to work and he saw the water in the
glass doing a nose dive he set up a
squawk for more water the conductor
told him to try the blow-off cock and
see if he had any water at all in the old

john burns

kettle since they only had one more
track to switch but the hogger kept up
such a racket about the water that they
finally pulled the pin and sent him to
the house

  he spotted the engine at the water
tank hopped off and chased into the
roundhouse for more help the fireboy
climbed back onto the tank to take
water and foiind the manhole cover
frozen on so solidly he had to take a
coal pick to knock it loose

  by this time the kid engineer re-
turned to the engine with the round-
house foreman two machinists the
boilermaker and couple of helpers the
roundhouse foreman was first man up
he reached for the old monitor injec-
tor and she commenced to purr for him
like a pet cat you see the darn tank
was frozen up air-tight and the old
monitor could not suck a drop of water
out of it

  at times there are things that a man
might like to forget but it is blamed
hard to forget them with a roundhouse
foreman two machinists a boiler-
maker and a bunch of helpers to re-
member them for you

	 

pulling the brewery on a hot day
was a job the different yard crews
were fond of for there was always a
cold bottle of beer for each of them
we were returning to the yard one
afternoon with two cars of beer wed
switched out at the brewery when we
heard something pounding around in
the engine tank

   there must be some of them sway-
braces or baffle plates loose in the tank
said old joe the engineer


railroad stories

  but we paid no attention to it then
that night joe made out a work report
at the roundhouse desk in which he
asked the house to examine the engine
tank for loose sway-braces the next
morning the hostler asked joe if he
knew what wras wrong in that tank

   no joe replied  not unless one
of them braces was loose

   braces me eye the hostler said
 there was a keg of beer in that tank
and the boilermakers helper got it out
the whole roundhouse gang was out
under the coal chutes pulling off a party
when i found them

 what was the trouble joe
wanted to know  didnt you get any
of it

   hardly any the hostler sadly re-
plied  it was only a small keg

  when joe got back to the engine he
asked shorty if he put the beer keg in
the old goats tank when we pulled the
brewery

   shure said shorty  did you
find it i lost it when i put it in there
the blame tank was half full of water
and i had no way to fish the damn keg
out

	 

christmas day that year rolled
along with the mercury down in
the cellar and a foot of snow on the
ground in those good old days a great
many saloons handed their early morn-
ing customers a christmas present-
generally a pint or half pint of holiday
cheer old frank the third man on the
yard crew had made a collection of
christmas presents and packed them in
the lantern box on the rear end of the
engine

  when joe turned in the engine at the
roundhouse he went back to the lantern
box and resurrected the life-savers
climbed back into the engine cab jerked
open the firebox door slammed all that

whisky into that firebox and up against
the flue sheet the old air pump came
to life with a wild and joyful whoop
and boy you could smell whisky all
over the job

  the roundhouse foreman and a main
line engineer were looking over an old
freight hog the engineer was trying
to convince the foreman that all he
needed to do to that old hog was to jack
up her whistle and put a new engine un-
der it but the foreman was a stubborn
old cuss and he was trying to convince
the hogger that the fact that the old
hog had a wheezy exhaust a hop-skip-
and-jump in her valve motion a few
leaky flues her piston packing blown
out and a couple of flat wheels was not
sufficient reason for taking her out of
service

  about that time they both got a
breath of the hot whisky with which
joes pet goat perfumed the fog

  joe the old man says  that cer-
tainly is a new one on me where the
heck did she get that whisky

  it took joe a long time to live down
the christmas day he brought in his
pet switcher with a whisky breath

	 

our company storekeeper was an
old tightwad to jolt him loose
from any company supplies was some
job every month he would send out a
couple of dozen new links and pins
along with the other company supplies
and a notice for the yardmaster to be
careful with them the result of this
move was that old mike the yardmas-
ter had got together as fine a bunch of
link and pin snatchers as ever worked
on any mans railroad links pins
switch chains rerailing frogs or a bunch
of empty grain cars in the harvesting
season-all came in handy if they hap-
pened to be loose at both ends and could
be moved at all
true tales of the rails



  switchmen working on the night
shifts had to furnish their own lanterns
one morning an old boomer pin-puller
struck old mike for a job in the garden

  yes mike said i can use an-
other man on the night shift if you
can scare up a lantern youre hired
the old boomer walked across the
tracks to a terminal switch shanty
swiped the first lantern he could lay
his hands on and told mike  if you
need any more lanterns ill go back
and get em for you

	 

old jerry monahan was a regular
old night hawk jerry claimed
he had railroaded for thirty years and
had never done a days work in his life
and that he still carried the same old
battle-scarred lantern with which he did
his first nights switching i do not re-
member how many sleepy engineers
lives jerry claimed to have saved by
throwing the lantern through a cab
window to wake them up when the en-
gineers were about to run a flag on him
but i remember he also claimed he
would never throw his lantern when he
could find a link or pin handy

  monk taylor the night hogger told
a green fireboy one night to keep an eye

on old jerrys signals the lad got his
head out the cab window and reported
to monk that jerry was not giving any
signals at all but that he was having
 one hell of a scrap down there with
that dom lantern

	 

the company stored about a hun-
dred empty grain cars one summer
in an old mill yard locked the gates and
forgot about them when the wheat
harvest got under way the cars were
ordered north some car tinks and oil-
ers were sent to the mill yard to get the
cars ready to move and when they
got to work they found every car
robbed of its journal brass brass
thieves had broken into the mill yard
and had got away with over  four-
and five-pound journal brasses they
had made a clean sweep

  speaking of stealing reminds me of
the grain thieves they could get grain
out of cars without breaking car seals
or opening car doors they would get
under a loaded grain car with a two-
inch augur bore holes in the car floor
fill their grain sacks and drive plugs in
the holes invariably the loss of the
grain would not be discovered until the
car was opened for grain inspection

  again i watched  big hooks hoist an engine
up a high embankment at evansville ind down
which she had plunged for a swim in pigeon
creek the crew jumped and escaped unhurt at
another time i saw a cylinder-head blow off the
right side of an ic engine in the same city

  in  i made several  side-door pullman 
trips crossing illinois several times one night
the train stopped with a bang two cars ahead
a car with a wheel off and the truck crosswise of

ties were torn up for a long distance the engi-
neer having felt the drag had stopped just in
time to prevent the bad-order truck from tearing
down the trestle and piling the train in the ditch

  one night a year ago a woman across the street
saw a red glare in the yards of the bo and
called the fire department a freight stopping

modern its plumb craziness
the ex-conductor cackled  whats
modern about puttin a hundred cars
on local freight an runnin through
just cause th company haint got no
agents left to get business

  he pointed his cane toward the hate-
ful display of modernity but dave
explained patiently

  we got streamlines an now we
must have telephones cause theyre
faster

silas martin inquired sympa-
thetically   haint got no wires
no more 

  dave shrugged we got these to
keep up with the fast trains

   fast trains the retired o r c
was sarcastic fast-where fast
in some terminal a-waitin fer a hun-
dred cars whilst folks uses trucks
shucks

  the agent raised his eyes from the
pot-bellied stove to set his old friend
right

 but we git th heavy freight si
 do yuh  old si straightened for
battle  flour mills installin heavier
machinery an it come by truck what
about that

   mr howell wanted it quick

   ha thought yuh had fast
trains the visitor removed the pipe
from his mouth  haint no local
switched fer two hours here in the past
six years now sam howells gettin
his wheat by truck an shippin his flour
by truck whats fast about that fer
th railroad

  the agents face wrinkled his re-
ply was unconvincing

   ill git mr howells business
again

   not from what i hear yuh wont
the old conductor denied  samll see
this railroad in hell fust

   whatd you hear si 

   plenty was the response
 heard sam was in here payin
freight on some cars of wheat an or-
derin two cars fer flour when that-
that-what yuh call im dave

   agency supervisor

   thats it new official fer snoop-
in well it seems he romped in an


railroad stories

found someone in yuhr office raised
hell an told yuh to do all business
through that

  si swept his cane angrily to point
to the sixteen-by-eighteen ticket win-
dow the only opening to the waiting
room beside the door

  the old agent was on the defensive
but he cut back with  mr barnes
didnt say a thing to mr howell

   didnt have to said the o r c
 sam haint dumb an sam haint
gonna spend his money where he has
to stick his head in no hole in a wall
shucks dave when sam goes to the
city they invite him inter their offices
they want his money

dave parsons flinched his eyes
pleading mutely with his old friend
 ill get him back si mr howell
wont see masonville agency closed
clo-clo- what

  the retired conductor was rocking
back and forth in terror his eyes wide
with incomprehension and doubt

   the companys asked the commis-
sion to abolish the office said the
agent  superintendent figures its a
needed economy

   err-arrugh the old conductor
seemed to be choking in that moment
he was chasing with his memory back
through the years then to the com-
fortable days since his retirement with
his old friend close masonville was
the world toppling

  no business droned the agent
he picked up the ticket report and held
it out  blank this month si

  the form dropped back on his desk
together they stared into the white
heart of the dying fire

presently si gulped they
closed old johns job at ham-
monds mill an old john died

  a long pause then si added with

a shake of his head  it wont work
dave

   what wont work 

   railroad that hopes to git business
with no agents to talk to th people
was the response  trucks call on
folks dave the ex-conductor leaned
forward earnestly  th railroads got
it wrong folks didnt think of them
dave you were their railroad

   local used to switch two hours at
hammonds mill the agent mused
 dont stop there no more last
month i got thirty-two shipments
used to get that many in one day
i-i reckon shell close si

   but you-you got seniority rights
dave forced a grin  aint fitted
for city jobs si an thats alls left
besides-

  his voice trailed away unnoticed
again he heard the last examiners
caustic comments on his dimming eyes
the next time    now reports said
the new eye-test book was mowing
them down like grain before the reaper

  elusive phantoms flickered over the
silent walls as the twro loyal veterans
sat pondering their iron pike shades
of night were dropping when old si
leaned over tapped the agents thin
knee and said

   folks uster look at th depot as a
community place dave in those days
we got news here we-we telegraphed
about the coming of our babies an our
marriages an our dead now- his
hand went flat

   course we did dave agreed
 an thats all changed now the men
thats running things these times haint
gonna do business through a hole in
a wall er leave stuff fer trains without
no agent to look after it

  the fiery old o r c stamped to-
ward the door dave leaped up ask-
ing youll come back si
closing days



  an git yuh fired si answered
 course not look at pete shultz
fr instance pete run an engine here
fer nigh on forty years last ten years
hes been dodderin about boostin this
railroad then that inspector fellow
catched him cornin out of here an told
him to loaf somewhere else petes
mad

   but si i-

   who said yuh could help it the
former conductor bristled  it didnt
help our railroad none when petes son-
in-law what runs th biggest store
here turned to trucks dad-burn it
all dave its a shame that stores
alius shipped here jes cause of old
pete

   but i-

   it wasnt that way when i run th
locals si went on  agents had
friends then now look an angry
swish of the cane narrowly missed the
agents face  who routs yuh outen
bed at night to do somethin fer them
like sam howell did to get a city doc-
tor fer his first baby

  the agent made no reply

   shucks im goin home said si

   you can come to my house an
visit si called the agent appealingly
 like you used to when lucy was
livin-

   house the old-time conductor
rocked about  there aint no huffin
an puffin of engines up there at your
house you aint got no drawbars
a-clangin an clankin up there on th
hill

the agents head dropped slowly
he backed into his chair all the
while watching the gray-haired orc
who was standing with one hand on
the doorknob he saw the wrist turn
the door slowly open

   gone si martin murmured

  the old clock caught up the agents
whisper and threw it mockingly back
   rules red-tape competition greed
   no more would farm folk rush to
doors to salute the human thing of
steam and steel   

  old dave forgot it was time to close
it didnt matter home was lonely
since the wife was dead he must
cleave to the sacred office as long as
possible

  down the tracks the late local whis-
tled for the board which was still red
mechanically old dave pulled the board
and held it with a salute the splendid
machine sped past sending back its
curling feather of steam and smoke
dave replaced the old-fashioned board
at stop

  fancies woven by the flickering
light of the dying fire carried him
away to bygone days once he had
sold a ticket to san francisco and all
that night in his dreams he had gone
with the romantic passenger away
across the continent to the golden
gate sparkling in the sunlight the
iron pike was a thing of imagination
then

  memory brought back the eager ex-
pectant faces of boys pressed against
the depot window admiring the instru-
ments that talked in tongues how
the lads had begged to be allowed one
moment of exalted bliss in touching
that magic key in it they saw the
mystery that unlocked the secrets of a
stretching world

  but now-youth flaunted its nose at
the agent who telephoned the messages
properly so for what privacy was
there in a message the agent bawled
into a phone for every gossip to hear
even the old clock showed its resent-
ment by ticking loudly to cover the
heinous offense

  fancy swept dave parsons back to


railroad stories

his youth and his first home with lucy
carried him to where the battered
desk was piled high with s and s
when the order board was nearly al-
ways red

  in dreams he saw si martin as a
young brakeman proud of the club and
lantern he possessed great days
those how lucy would fly to his
arms when he finally came home at
night

  now the silver screen of memory
darkened just a beaten old man fac-
ing a lonely evening of life and be-
cause modern greed needed profits he
must go the friendly talking steam
must give away to the diesel stream-
line-a frankenstein mounted on
stolen rails   

  no he couldnt battle against the
streamline he was tired very tired
and lucy was calling from a halo of
the past   

through the black night an im-
perious scream bore down upon
masonville villagers paused at their
evening meal as it pierced the air a
few of them moved toward their de-
pot the streamline was honoring
them with a stop

  time is the essence of the stream-
line frustrated crew moved into the
unlighted depot above which gleamed
the blood red eye of an ofder board
someone cursed an official com-
manded

  electric rays of the conductors lamp
bit into the office by an uncompleted
ticket report sat the figure of an old
man hunched in his chair

  the noise hushed with sudden
fear the conductor flashed his lamp
closer on that fine old face he saw
the serene smile of one who rested at
last from the stress of a busy life   

  masonville depot had closed

trainmens school friend

while my uncle pete was braking on
the monon route between chicago and
indianapolis about  years ago several
boes were killed riding blinds the com-
pany issued orders that trainmen were to
put tramps off but only when the train had
stopped one day a bum was riding and
the con said to my uncle pete when we
get to the next stop chase that bird off
as pete was telling the fellow to pile
off the tramp pulled out a  and snarled
 ill get off when i damn please mean-
while shoving the gun in my uncles ribs
naturally the bum was allowed to stay on

when my uncle came back in the car the
con asked did you get rid of that bozo
 no john was the reply  i hadnt the
heart to chase him off i used to go to
school with that fellow

oh you did sneered the con well
ill get rid of him

then the con went back  come on
bum said he unload the bo again
used his gun when the con came back my
uncle inquired did you chase him off
john

  no pete the con smiled  i used to
 go to school with him too-j minwegan

railroading in arkansaw

 come listen to my story and ill tell
 you in my chant

 its the lamentation of an irish emigrant
 who lately crossed the ocean and misfor-
 tune never saw

till he worked upon the railroad in the
    state of arkansaw
the sunny side of the track



 when i landed in st louis id ten dollars
    and no more

 i read the daily papers until both me eyes
    were sore

 i was looking for advertisements and then
 at length i saw
 five hundred men were wanted in the
 state of arkansas

 oh how me heart it bounded when i read
    the joyful news

 straightway then i started for the
    raging billie hughes

 says he hand me five dollars and a
 ticket you will draw
 that will take you to the railroad in the
 state of arkansaw

 i handed him the money but it gave me soul
    a shock

 and soon was safely landed in the city of
    little rock

 there was not a man in all that land that
 would extend to me his paw
 and say  youre heartily welcome to the
 state of arkansaw

 i wandered round the depot i rambled up
    and down

 i fell in with a man-catcher and he said
    his name was brown

 he says you are a stranger and youre
    looking rather raw

 on yonder hill is me big hotel its the
    best in arkansaw

 then i followed my conductor up to the very
    place

 where poverty was depicted in his dirty
    brockey face

 his bread was corn dodger and his mate i
    couldnt chaw

 and fifty cents he charged for it in the
    state of arkansaw

 then i shouldered up my turkey hungry as
    the sharks

 traveling along the road that leads to the
    ozarks

 such sights of dirty bummers im sure you
    never saw

 as worked upon the railroad in the state
    of arkansaw

 i am sick and tired of railroading and i
    think ill give it oer

 ill lay the pick and shovel down and ill
    railroad no more

 ill go out in the indian nation and ill
    marry me there a squaw

 and ill bid adieu to railroading and the
    state of arkansaw -anonymous

a clever railroad owner

two -year-old locomotives still are in
use at fitchburg mass they operate
over what is known as the john cushing
railroad which bears the name of its
builder it is a single-tracked system which
the late mr cushing used in connection with
his grain business

  an astute business man legend has it
that when he built the little road cushing
mailed free passes to all the railway presi-
dents throughout the country not realiz-
ing that no passengers were ever to ride
over the cushing road some of these presi-
dents as a matter of courtesy sent cush-
ing free passes for their roads cushing
used the passes to travel over the country
in connection with his grain business-

origin of a towns name

tobar in elko county nevada is pro-
nounced  towbar the name appears
to have a spanish origin but m b badt
gives the real explanation

   when the western pacific railroad was
building in  or  the construction
camp was maintained at the present site
of the town of tobar there was a sign
pointing to the rag saloon a temporary
structure built of canvas which read  to
bar the camp and later the town were
known by this name

	 

a check for a nickel

jg pratt recently retired from

	active service in the canadian
national shops at stratford ont has a
memento of early days which he treasures
highly it is a cheque paid to him by the
grand trunk for his work in oct  an
old yet well-preserved document

  the cheque is for the exact amount of
five cents it was originally for  cents
but  cents was taken off for insurance
it must have been a month when mr pratt
was sick most of the time or else away on
vacation-canadian national ry magazine

	 

 added engine value
ow much would you say your horse
was worth asked a new haven
claim adjuster investigating a farmers
compensation claim

   at least  declared the farmer
  pedigreed stock no doubt

  well not exactly but you cant judge
a horse like that by its parents

 no the adjuster agreed shrewdly
ive often noticed how crossing a horse
with an engine will improve its breed

canadian-ameri-
can member of the

torical society mr
famhams collec-
tion numbers some
 railroad
pictures including
actual photos old prints magazine clip-
pings etc facts about him were supplied
by i g davidson  dupont ave s
minneapolis and his son john d david-
son memphis tenn

  farnham was bom in milltown new
brunswick march   while in
school he used to draw engine pictures on
his slate and was bawled out by unappre-
ciative teachers later he got a mill job
in maine and often hung around the shops
of the old washington county r r
ellsworth to calais  miles he ran
errands for an engineers wife the engi-
neer gave him  copies of the engineers
and firemens magazines from their pages
the boy clipped the nucleus of his present
great collection

  farnham is today a motorman with 
years service on the minneapolis street
ry but his enthusiasm for steam roads
is keen he has engine pictures from all
over the world neatly packed in boxes
albums and glass library cases which com-
pletely fill a whole room this room is
appropriately called  the roundhouse
the collection is partly indexed in addi-
tion many framed engine pictures and
lithographs adorn the walls of his home

  he has many actual photos of engines
wrecks etc obtained from correspondence

 with iepc members and other sources

    in  he received a letter from henry
 ford asking about a certain locomotive
 operating after  years of continuous serv-
 ice such an inquiry might have floored
 most of the engine-picture fans-but not
 farnham he promptly selected from his
 collection an old rogers built in  and
 still wheeling em on the pisco-ica r r in
 peru south america

   on one occasion h a robertson of
 st paul mentioned that his grandfather
 was run over and badly injured by a loco-
 motive named the albion about  years
 ago while attempting to drive a hay wagon
 across the tracks of nova scotias first
 railway and he had long wanted a photo
 of that engine farnham found among his
 duplicates a picture of the albion and gave
 it to him incidentally a photo of this
 engine appeared in our march  issue

   while famham was driving a street car
 on the old colony r r in boston years
 ago he struck up an acquaintance with one
 of his passengers - a young community
 nurse named myrtle olmsted-fell in love
 with her and in  he married her

     we had plenty of thrills in street-rail-
 way work he says  for seven years i
 drove the money wagon as that car was
 called displaying a  not in service  sign
 and with all blinds drawn and carrying an
 armed crew she operated from  p m
 till midnight collecting the days receipts
 from the various barns one night a gang
 held up the car murdered the cashier fred
 devlin and got away with the money

   next month we will present thomas t
 taber chairman of the ry  loco his-
 torical society new york chapter for
 future issues the fans are asked to recom-
 mend other leaders of the engine-picture
 hobby in u s and canada tell us whom
 youd like to read about-and why we
 cant guarantee to print personality
 sketches of every collector you suggest but
 will use as many as we can

hints on collecting railroad stamps

unlike stepping out with a camera and taking shots of locomotives etc the
railroad postage-stamp hobby requires much patience usually you wait and
hope-wait until a friend happens to send you one of the coveted specimens and then
hope he will find more that is unless you can afford to buy them direct from dealers

    some collectors trade photos for stamps you find such notices occasionally in
the columns of our international engine picture club it is advisable to get a stand-
ard catalog giving the value of stamps in all countries in order to make fair exchanges
for instance the c u s stamp of  showing the empire state express printed
upside down is worth  the c u s stamp of  showing a -- type loco-
motive is valued at c if you give anyone the former stamp in exchange for the
latter you lose exactly 

    i have nothing for sale but if any iepc member wants to know the value of a
certain railroad postage-stamp and does not have access to a catalog he may send
me a detailed description of it enclosing a self-addressed stamped envelope and ill
state its value without charge

    you do not need an album for this hobby a c loose-leaf notebook serves me
perfectly never paste down your stamps use the common transparent hinges if
possible save money by getting your philatelic supplies through a stamp club in your
own town some members offer railroad stamps in trade or at low cost they
will tell you about various specimens for instance the canadian national railways
use regular postage-stamps punched with the letters cnr to minimize losses by
theft some roads here and abroad issue publicity  stickers these are not postage-
stamps of course they have no value but such a collection is picturesque and inter-
esting-robert white pontiac mich
  rolling down to reno

     me and goldenrod almost find a vein of
     gold under the virginia  truckee roadbed

 by the engine picture kid

s the old saying goes one
mans meet is another
mans poison-especially
if it is a cornfield meet and
aint on the timecard but
such things will happen on any single-
track pike when an ambitious dispatch-
er tries to run  trains down the line at
the same time and forgets they are go-
ing in different directions

  this phenomenon does not come un-
der the head of classy railroading

  of course me and goldenrod was
never bothered with cornfield meets
when we was wheeling them high wide
and handsome for her father hardshell
higgins on his -mile road in sas-
katchewan canada that was mostly
on account of the happy valley line
dont own but one locomotive an an-
cient baldwin -wheeler that i must
say looked very pretty the way golden-
rod had fixed it up with chintz curtains
on the cab windows and potted
geraniums and everything

  it is different on the virginia 
truckee running into reno nevada
where me and goldenrod are now
working they have got more than one

locomotive on that pike some of them
have passed the retirement age a long
time ago-like no  for instants an
old brass-bound fast-stepper which has
been in service for  years and is still
running

  me being an engine picture fien of
purest ray serene like about ten thou-
sand  other members of the
international engine picture club 
will naturally travel a lot of miles to
get fresh shots of old and new motive
power of every description

  so i am very glad when this fellow
james h richardson invites me and
goldenrod out to reno we get his in-
vitation while we are out in hollywood
making a railroad movie like i tell
about in the feb railroad stories

  of course i cannot give reno any
divorce business-as i am still only en-
gaged to hardshell higginss good-
looking all-burn haired daughter we
are not even married yet

   hmm snorts goldenrod when 
mention that maybe we will go to reno
 rushing things arent you kid

   oh no i says  i only want to
look the ground over




railroad stories

  goldenrod lifts her eyebrows and i
explain that i am naturally referring to
railroad ground

   all right she says  but dont let
me catch you looking over any of those
snappy blond divorcees staying in
reno

  you wont i says anyhow i
am chiefly interested in the new south-
ern pacific mountain power

   in that case lets go says golden-
rod who is a very good sport and en-
joys traveling around the country as
much as i do

  we take one of the sps crack
trains east from the coast and i play
quite a joke on the hard-boiled railroad
bull who yanks me out from behind the
tender where i am riding blind bag-
gage goldenrod is back in the
varnished wagons

   hey you bum this dick yells
grabbing for one of my legs  you
cant ride this train

   thats what makes horse racing
i yell back

   heh snorts the bull

   difference of opinion i says

  well he tries to dislodge me but i
cannot help laughing when he smacks
me on the chin for getting fresh and i
can show him a perfectly good ticket to
reno which i had all the time only
from force of habit riding freights and
everything back and forth across the
country i had forgot that i was a pay-
ing guest of the southern pacific and
had climbed onto my hidden perch when
the limited started

jim richardson meets us in
reno which is not very hard for
him to do as he is baggageman at the
sp depot on the  pm to 
shift he is also serving his second
term as president of the local brother-
hood of railroad clerks

  he spots me right away on account
of me wearing my iepc button be-
sides i am carrying a couple of
cameras and am looking around for a
couple more locomotives to snap in ad-
dition to the jack that hauled us into
town

   hi there kid he shouts waving
me down

  with him are his two youngsters
albert and robert albert is  years
old and robert only  both are al-
ready engine picture enthusiasts

   wheres goldenrod  pipes up al-
bert breaking into a very interesting
conversation which me and his father
are having about how we was both call
boys when we started railroading jim
as he insists i call him began when he
was  on the western pacific up at
winnemucca his home town

   gosh i says  i had almost for-
got about goldenrod because the last
thing she told me when we left the
coast was that i was not to have any
good-looking women on my mind when
we got to reno

   i hope she didnt forget to get off
the train puts in robert he turns
to his father  daddy cant i see
goldenrod 

   im anxious to meet her myself
laughs jim and just then she comes
over toward the baggage truck against
which we are leaning

   gee goldenrod i says after the
introductions are over  me and mr
richardson are going over to sparks
where the southern pacific shifts from
mountain power running west to
lighter power traveling east he
says we also can get some shots of
lighter and older hogs running north
and south on the branch lines im sure
glad i come to reno

   kid says goldenrod with a quiet
smile  ive heard of golf widows but
rolling down to reno



i can see that engine picture widows are
going to be the next variation

   yeh adds jim  thats what
mrs richardson always says

  im figuring that maybe i will work
around the sp depot in reno smash-
ing baggage with richardson but he
says the sp is very funny that way
when any trunks are busted they like to
have the old hands do it

  me and goldenrod then wind up on
the virginia  truckee which reminds
me of mr higginss happv valley
line only all the employees aint rela-
tives of the president like they are on
the h v besides the v  t is quite a
bit longer it also has some very fine
mountain grades

  i am firing the brass-decorated no
ii the snappy old-timer with a --
wheel arrangement and fancy mud-
guards over her drivers amos sipes
her hogger has been handling elevens
throttle so long he practically feels the
hog belongs to him and is not company
property

  mr sipes is an eagle-eye who looks
like a dignified doctor in overalls on
account of a neatly-trimmed silver-
gray beard he wears this personal
whiskbroom is not long enough to tuck
under the red bandana he has tied about
his neck but it wags up and down like
a haywire semaphore when he starts
jawing with roscoe bates conductor
on his train

  i notice that bates has sideburns in
fact the whole train crew looks like
they was dragged off the board of di-
rectors and put to work

goldenrod aint in train service
on the v  t they dont have
room for her even on the extra board
which is composed of assorted veterans
of the rail instead she lands a cushy
job as secretary to superintendent mc-

ginnis and has to work down in carson
city where the general offices are

   know anything about the clerical
end of railroading mr mcginnis
asks goldenrod  i heard you are pret-
ty good at wheelin em over the high
iron

   ive had executive experience
too she says coloring under the su-
pers praise  i was acting president
of the happy valley line during the
big grain rush last season when dad
had to wheel freight

   thats right says mcginnis  so
you were

  i guess the super reads his railroad
stories every month the same as me
and jim richardson do and about a
million other guys all over the world

  what with moving around and tak-
ing engine pictures and getting golden-
rod settled in carson city i am very
tired when i start my first run on the
v  t

  there is a good head of steam in the
boiler and i am corked off on the right-
hand seatbox dreaming of having a
jack of my own to roll some day and
maybe snoring slightly    when amos
sipes the engineer comes barging into
the cab

   of all the blinkety-blank lazy tal-
lowpots he yells in my ear for a
moment i think i am back on the hap-
py valley and it is goldenrods father
talking to me

   you cant sleep in this cab storms
the hogger which is a very foolish
statement and not in line with the facts

   on the contrary mr sipes 
says if you would pipe down i
could sleep here very comfortably

   well you aint goin to he goes
on his chin whiskers dancing around
 get some steam in this pile of junk

  just then the safety pops off which
is the answer to that one


railroad stories

   shes got all shell hold right now
mr sipes i says

  amos gives me a dirty look slaps
himself down on the leather seat
cushion and makes a vicious grab for
the throttle

  when he gets his highball from con-
ductor bates back on the end of the
short string of ancient wooden passen-
ger coaches he pulls out of minden
like he was trying to make no  jump
fences i guess there is more on his
mind than his cap while we are swing-
ing down the right-of-way and  am
not mistaken

  out of a clear sky he turns to me

    this roads gettin so it aint fit for
a man to work on he explodes dig-
ging in his jumper pocket he pulls out
a sheet of green flimsy

   read it he orders  more con-
founded red tape and i bet it is some
of that new female secretary of mc-
ginniss work

  i must say the general order dont
sound so harsh to me it merely states
that in future the train crews will not
halt their trains on regular runs to pros-
pect for gold alongside the right-of-
way

   me and roscoe bates has got a
good claim down the line a ways
amos mumbles into his beard  staked
it last week

   he takes the flimsy back rolls it into
a little wad and flips it out the cab
window

   what i want to know is he barks
at the steam gage in front of him
 whos runnin this train me or mc-
ginnis

   well mr sipes i says  after
all you cant run a train on schedule
and prospect at the same time

  who says i cant flares up the
old man  i been doin it for years and
there aint nothin happened yet

   not yet i says  but it is funny
about railroading what aint hap-
pened in the last  years may happen
in the next thirty seconds

just then we hear a locomotive
whistle in the distants we swing
around a bend and there standing up
the track a piece is no  a southbound
passenger local

   the sonovagun snaps the engi-
neer closing his throttle and reaching
for his air  thats pete obrien he
was supposed to wait for us back at
stewart

  we buck and slide some until amos
gets his train under control then he
glides down easily and comes to a halt
with elevens pilot a few yards away
from the nose of no  grabbing a
spanner wrench the old man swings
out of the cab and strides forward im
right behind him

   i bet pete snuck down to do some
assessment work on his claim he says
 petes located right next to me and
bates

  eights hogger aint around his en-
gine but sipes locates him digging a
trench back on the desert and heads for
him

  whats the trouble shouts my
engineer  why aint you back where
you belong

   yeh snaps pete obrien  i had
enough time on you to get into the sid-
ing up at pinon gulch how come you
aint there the boys reported a new
gold strike in the gulch yesterday
figured you and roscoe would be look-
ing around a bit whats the hurry
going to a wedding or something

   didnt you get a copy of that new
general order asks amos still
bristling

   sure says the other hogger  but
 slung it out the window figured at
rolling down to reno



your age you wouldnt pay no attention
to them things

   well says amos drawing him-
self up very dignified  i run by the
book    sometimes you gotta back
up to stewart and let me through

   the heck i have snaps pete
obrien dropping his shovel and com-
ing close  you back up to the gulch
and ill pass you there anyhow look
at this gravel its bonanza dirt

  he shows mr sipes some sandy dirt
with little yellow specks of virgin gold
in it

   gosh all thunder exclaims amos
 thats sure rich i aint goin back
you go back to the town and ill wait
here till you have time to get in the
clear

  obrien laughs at the old man it is
very plain that each hogger wants to
stay where he is and do a little pros-
pecting on his own while the other
backs his train into the clear

  it is about  miles into stewart
and the same distance back to the pass-
ing track at pinon gulch both men
are very stubborn just like mr hard-
shell higgins while they are arguing
the situation i decide to get my camera
from the left-hand seatbox and take a
few shots of this cornfield meet on the
v  t

  the passengers in both trains are
leaning out the windows trying to dis-
cover what the trouble is outside of
that it seems they are used to un-
scheduled stops and delays on the rail-
road

  on account of the sun is wrong i
have to go over to the other side of the
engines to take my picture i am sur-
prised to see a couple of men digging
not far out there in the desert

  when they see me with a camera
they drop their shovels and run toward
the train i guess they was maybe pas-

sengers doing some prospecting them-
selves

  anyhow on account of a picture al-
ways looks better with people in it in-
stead of just plain machinery like a
couple of locomotives i shift my
camera so that these  bozos are in-
cluded in one of the shots i also decide
that maybe if i can locate them later in
the train i will arrange to sell them a
few copies of the picture for a souvenir

well i get all the views i want
and still the  engines are stand-
ing face to face smoke curling out of
their stacks there aint no sign of
amos sipes or pete obrien either

  i am leaning against a milepost sign
right even with the cab of eleven when
conductor bates comes along

   aint them nitwit hoggers settled
this cornfield meet yet he asks

   it dont look like it mr bates i
says  i guess they are still over on the
other side of the tracks arguing

   hmmph says roscoe bates rub-
bing a little desert dust off the brass
buttons on his coat and shining them
with the back of his sleeve we sure
cant stay here all day there aint no
diner on the train

  telling me to come with him he
crosses over between the pilots of the
engines amos and pete are still argu-
ing hot and heavy

   boys says the conductor sternly
 this aint going to get us anywhere
let me settle the point in a dignified
railroad fashion

    im goin to settle it with this span-
ner in a couple of seconds thunders
amos waving his wrench under
obriens nose

   sssh says bates  youre too old
for such violence amos im going to
be fair and square ive got a coin here
which i shall toss into the air heads


railroad stories

obrien backs his train up tails
you back up to pinon gulch

   that aint railroadin snaps
amos  its gamblin

  roscoe dont pay any attention to the
old fellow he heaves the silver dollar
he is holding high into the air then it
takes him  minutes to find where it
landed in the gravel

   heads he announces gravely
obrien takes a squint at the coin
and nods his head bates picks up the
dollar as pete shuffles toward his train
and swings up into the engine cab he
releases his air and pretty soon no 
is backing slowly down the track in the
direction she came

   i dont approve of settlin things
that way roscoe says amos pulling
at his beard as the  of us walk over
toward our brass-bound hog  i aint
a gamblin man

   me neither says bates  gam-
blings against my principles

  he gives me a sly wink as he pulls
the so-called dollar from his vest pocket
and slowly turns it over in the palm of
his hand both sides are heads

   had it made for me in reno he
grins heading for the rear end of his
train

i must say that railroading on the
v  t is conducted along very
informal lines which is what i explain
to goldenrod a few nights later when
we have rolled into reno

  we have picked up jim richardson
and his family and we are taking in
one of the citys hot-spots for a little
quiet dancing and celebration

  some people will claim that a man
with a past is more interesting to the
female sects but personally i believe
the guy with a present gets along better
especially if the present is a good one
like the one i give goldenrod on this

occasion-prints of all the engines 
have taken since we came to nevada
there is quite a pile of them too

  goldenrod having looked the pic-
tures over and the next dance being a
waltz we move out onto the floor to
the strains of a swell orchestra a very
peculiar tingle creeps up and down my
spine as i hold goldenrod tight in my
arms as we glide to the tempo of the
music i guess it is love or else a
touch of rheumatism i may have got
from working the mountain run with
old amos

  for quite a spell neither me nor
goldenrod says a word just dancing
together is sufficient in fact its divine

  finally goldenrod breaks the silence
 kid she says  supt mcginnis is
worried

   most railroad supers are these
days i says

   his case she says solemnly  is
different

   whats he worried about i says
 the men prospecting along the
road 

   partly says goldenrod

  then she tells me that the railroad
owns a lot of the land adjoining its
right-of-way lately there has been a
cattle man wanting to buy a large tract
for grazing land

   why dont mr mcginnis sell it
i says above the music

   because goes on goldenrod  he
has a hunch that the grazing gag is only
a blind and that the cattle man is only
a dummy owner hes afraid a mining
syndicate is behind the deal and is try-
ing to beat down the price on the story
that the land is wanted only for ranch-
ing purposes

   in that case i says  why dont
he refer the whole problem to the light
of the lantern dept of railroad
stories
rolling down to reno



   oh he did goldenrod tells me
 and the editor says to put the matter
up to the president of the road but the
president happens to be in new york
he wired back that bill was in the field
and for him to use his own judg-
ment

   yeh i says its a peculiar
situation

  goldenrod gives me a pitying look
and she goes on  theres been copper
mining down around there for a long
time but in  placer gold was dis-
covered in the singatse mountains and
nobody knows where the gold will be
found next everybodys been pros-
pecting lately

   including amos sipes i says

  goldenrods story makes sense to me
you see roscoe bates was telling on
the run down how it aint so long ago
since folks discovered that part of the
v  t roadbed lay over a -million
dollar vein of ore

  in fact a section of the road was
moved across a canyon so the sutro
tunnel coalition co inc which
owned the vein could sink a shaft and
recover all that new wealth about 
hundred feet of new track had to be
laid so the v  t could detour around
the lode

list then the music stops

  me and goldenrod start back
through the couples on the dance floor
toward our table goldenrod spots
jim and his missus also making for our
table where the rest of their family are
making pretzel houses

  the four of us are almost there when
i see  guys standing off to one side
they are fellows i am very anxious to
meet being the  lads who was in the
picture i took of amos sipes recent
cornfield meet with pete obrien

   wait a minute goldenrod i says

letting go of her arm  theres a
couple of fellows i want to talk to
one of them looks up as i push
through the throng the  whisper to-
gether and then make for the door

   hey i says  you with the stet-
son 

  before i can catch up with them
however they are practically out the
front door

   naw barks one of the men when
i explain why i have pursued them
 we dont want no pictures

  but his companion jabs him in the
ribs

   sure he says  well take 
dozen copies the next time you see us
toodle-oo funny-face

  with that they hurry out of the door
laughing i am smiling myself when i
start back for my table at the good
news i will have to tell goldenrod of
selling  dozen engine pictures to one
bird

   fine says goldenrod shaking
her head slowly  but who is the fel-
low did you get his name and ad-
dress kid

  gosh i says i forgot to re-
member to ask him

  both goldenrod and jim richardson
give me a very thorough ribbing over
this but i do not say anything as i
am one who believes that he laughs best
who laughs afterwards besides i have
a hunch that  will know where to find
these  birds again some day

  before we go home for the night
j im says he thinks he will make the trip
all the way down to minden on the
v  t and get himself some good
shots of the old power used on the
road

   make it next saturday suggests
goldenrod  im going to ride out
with the kid then myself

   oke says jim looking at his wife


railroad stories

 and i guess ill bring mrs richard-
son and the youngsters along too

  the children clap their hands in glee

it appears that supt bill mcginnis
has a weakness for engine photos
like a lot of other railroad executives
so i give him a bunch of pictures i have
taken on the v  t

  of course i do not include the one
with pete obrien and amos sipes
walking past the pilots of no n and
no  because i dont want to have to
explain how come the two hoggers
were prospecting along the right-of-
way after the general order had been
issued forbidding such practices

  saturday comes around we pick up
goldenrod at carson city i must say
she looks very pretty and efficient in a
brown tweed sports suit as she comes
forward to the cab where i am doing
my daily dozen with the coal scoop jim
and his family are already aboard

  i introduce goldenrod to amos
sipes the old guy beams all over
which is very complimentary from this
hogger because he is a rail who is usu-
ally as cranky as goldenrods father
hardshell higgins when he is at the
throttle

   boys she says  better watch
your step this run superintendent mc-
ginnis is going with us

  amos is leaning out the window
watching for roscoe batess highball
but mostly his eyes are on goldenrod

  then she explains to me that the
super is going to make his decision on
the land deal over the week-end he
wants to be up in the solitude of the
mountains to do his master-minding

  amos dont catch his highball till
bates gives it a second time then he
eases open his throttle and stands
ready to horse the johnson bar back a
few notches as the drivers grip the

rails and the train moves forward
goldenrod stands back and swings
aboard the first passenger coach as it
rolls by

  it aint long before amos has cracked
his throttle wide open and we are spin-
ning across the country to the swift
throb of the old hogs shrill exhaust

   im goin to give mcginnis the ride
of his life says amos watching the
ribbon of glistening steel slide under
the leading truck wheels  hes been
moanin for a long time about this en-
gine figures she oughtta been retired
long ago

  he gives a little sigh  but when she
goes he continues  i go too

  i can understand the old mans feel-
ings because goldenrod used to feel
the same way about her own little
baldwin up on the happy valley line

  we must be doing  an hour and
the cab is rocking so bad it is hard to
hit the grate with black diamonds
amos dont say a word when a load of
coal misses the firebox door and sprays
itself all over the floorplates he dont
shut down on his speed either

   anyhow i says bracing myself
against the motion of the engine  i
hope we dont meet pete obrien pros-
pecting out in the middle of the desert
 me too says amos with a broad
grin  it would be too bad for pete
this time

  then he adds more seriously  ill
watch the road you get over in that
left-hand window and look ahead for
smoke

we go by stewart all right the
grades hold us back some but
amos is driving eleven like he was late
with the u s mail

  i	am at my post looking ahead from
the tallowpots side suddenly i tense
at what i see
rolling down to reno



   wipe the clock i shout to amos

  at the sound of my words the engi-
neer stiffens one hand instantly
closes the throttle and his other reaches
for the air valve

rod behind them a whole crowd of
passengers are streaming from the cars

  but i pay no attention to any of
them up ahead tearing across the
desert is the guy in the stetson and his
companion who ordered them  dozen
engine photos from me with me busi-
ness is always business besides amos
was running so far ahead of time
hed have at least an hour to wait
at pinon gulch for pete obrien

   what the blinkety-blank  snorts
amos his eyes still straining ahead

  the wooden cars rattle behind us as
we buck and jump along the rails i hit
the dirt running before the train has
even come to a stop i land right be-
side the milepost that marks the spot
where amos and pete had their corn-
field meet

  behind i can hear the sound of men
shouting and the tramp of running
feet one glance back and i can see
amos taking after me and conductor
bates and j im richardson and golden-

  the guy with the stetson and his
companion are getting away from me
until the former trips over a stone in
the desert and goes sprawling on his
face turning to see what has hap-
pened the other guy crashes into a
clump of prickly pear

  he is still picking cactus needles out
of his caboose when i catch up with
them

   hey i says  where do you fel-
lows want them engine pictures sent

i	got em all ready for you

   nuts says the guy with the hat

 hey where do you want
them engine pictures sent
i got em ready for you 


railroad stories

  amos and roscoe bates join us

   gone plumb loco says amos to
the panting conductor  didnt think
he was a drinkin man neither but he
shouts to me to wipe the clock and
there aint even a horny toad on the
track

  bates lights into me too i do not
get a chance to squeeze a word of ex-
planation in sideways

   ordinarily i wouldnt mind
snaps the conductor  but with supt
mcginnis ridin the train it-it looks
terrible sloppy railroading

  even goldenrod looks at me very re-
provingly and i am indeed embar-
rassed to be getting such a bawling out
in front of the girl to whom i am en-
gaged

   aw shucks says richardson
 he meant well

  right then i figure i am fired be-
cause supt mcginnis pushes amos
aside and stands in front of me theres
a grin on his face a mile wide

   kid he says extending his hand
 put her there youve saved the v 
t a lot of money

   mr mcginnis i explain  al-
ways try to burn as little coal as pos-
sible no matter what road  am work-
ing on

   im not talking about coal says
the super  youve showed me whos
behind the land deal that nevada joes
been trying to engineer he laughs at
the guy with the stetson  wanted it
for grazing did you joe

  then he turns to the other fellow
 all right forbes he says  mon-
day well sign the papers in reno-on
an honest basis

  the fellow shrugs his shoulders
 reckon the jigs up he whispers to
the guy with the stetson  suppose
well have to pay the road what the
lands worth-as mining property-
after all

  on our way back to the train i turn
to the super

  i	have something on my mind

   by the way mr mcginnis i
says  if youve got that fellow
forbes full name and address id like
to have it he promised to buy  dozen
engine photos from me

juggling a nitro train

railroad construction was full of perils and not the least of
them were those which went with handling and transportation
of high explosives chemistry during the period of intense rail-
road development was not exactly the science it became in later
years faulty mixtures were all too plentiful and they had a way
of going off at unexpected times and places many construction
men muckers and engineers were shorn of arms legs eyes and
other parts of their anatomy due to premature explosions how-
ever at times the handling of dangerous materials had its hu-
morous as well as tragic side and one of these was the episode
of the nitro train during the construction of the cpr between
winnipeg and prince arthurs landing now port arthur ontario

    steel had been completed in  from port arthur to martin  miles west
but the roadbed was anything except smooth and straight as the port arthur  daily
sentinel said the road resembled the outline of a snake killed in the midst of its
convolutions a train passing over it imitated the motions of a ship at sea and the
chances of the engine leaving the rails were as numerous as the twists and turns them-
selves

                                                                   r
juggling a nitro train



     port arthur head of the lakes was naturally the supply base for all construction
 material steamers from canada and the united states poured cargoes of railroad
 supplies into the port from where it was later shipped to the end of steel via the road-
 bed described above

     one cargo of nitro-glycerine was domiciled for a time at port arthur as its tricky
 nature was known the city fathers insisted that so long as it remained in town it be
 distributed in different places the road officials complied and removed a portion of
 it to what is now fort william stored in a shack on the present site of the cpr
 roundhouse it let go one day for no apparent reason fortunately no one was in-
 jured but everyone was scared stiff

     get your damned stuff out-and quick was the ultimatum of the port arthur
 officials to the road were making a city of this place and have no desire to be blown
 clear across lake superior in canada when governmental bodies clash with private
 enterprise private enterprise usually comes off second best the railroad took steps
 to remove the remaining five freight cars of nitro inasmuch as it was being used
 at the end of steel that was the logical place to store it and rileys siding near mar-
 tin was chosen as its next resting place but the road ran into a snag no train
 crew would haul the stuff jobs in those days were not hard to get and every cpr
 man in the train service at the lake head simply excused himself

     john king a young french-canadian from montreal knocking about the country
 to see what he could see heard of the railroads dilemma he had been employed
 previously at a nearby gravel pit and knew something of explosives for a substantial
 consideration he volunteered to take the nitro to rileys siding he was given full
 charge and authority to recruit the necessary help

     first he cajoled an engineer and a fireman by proposing that they put the five
 cars of nitro on the tail end of a thirty car train of empties fine thirty cars would
 provide quite a buffer in case anything went wrong king didnt know that exactly but
 he made the engineer and fireman believe it so far so good but how are you going
 to get a conductor flagman and brakeman to ride in a caboose hooked onto five cars
 of nitro

     john king scratched his head apparently the thought of putting the caboose
 next to the engine never entered his mind he talked the matter over with bob craig
 a conductor and they decided that craig and one brakeman could ride a velocipede
 behind the train just in case they were needed the simple matter of brakes was
 almost overlooked there was no air in those days and setting brakes meant getting
 out on the train with a brake stick

     fortunately the grades were few and moderate on a bright morning with a
 cleared track to rileys siding a locomotive with thirty-five cars-thirty empties be-
 tween the engine and the nitro-pulled out of port arthur king himself rode the
 caboose coupled onto the last nitro car five miles behind maintaining that distance
 throughout the entire journey came bob craig and a brakeman on a velocipede only
 when the train halted to permit its crew to eat did the velocipede catch up

     king was worried he knew engineers the big thing on his mind during the
 -mile trip was would the hogger forget the nature of his freight would he uncon-
 sciously or sub-consciously give the cars a playful bang now and then would the
 slack in the links run in or out eventually after enough worry to drive away the
 thoughts of the money he would get the train and its one man crew in the caboose
 reached rileys siding so did bob craig and his brakeman almost a day later still
 on the velocipede

a tiny scrap of paper

 a tiny scrap of paper
by n a critchett jan issue had
a special appeal to me because as
a boy in chicago i worked as an ex-
press messenger on the rock island old-timers
often spoke of the cruel murder of kellogg
nichols i covered the same run many times
the head car in which the messenger rode was
known as the peoria car he rode in this car
and handled local express between chi and bureau
jet where he turned the car over to the peoria
branch messenger then he went into the rear
or kansas city car and worked with the bag-
gageman the rest of the way to kc

  newt watt had  brothers tom and bob also
baggagemen on the ri both were fine men
who were later retired on pension and have since
died i worked with them and at one time
lived next door to bob in chicago i understand
newt also was o k until he came under
schwartzs influence

  i worked with conductor fred wagner on the
chicago-west liberty run for a couple of years
and knew him well i also worked with con-
ductor danforth

  the boys said nichols was somewhat careless
in his duties and the cause of much concern to
uncle joe sheppard manager of the western

  casey jones fire-
man march issue re-
called the tragic day 
years ago when i was sent
to grenada miss to com-
plete caseys run and bring
his train back to memphis
casey and i had been
friends for years his death to the wreck was
a blow to me his widow and children are liv-
ing today so is his fireman sim webb about
whom the article in railroad stories was printed
i know sim well he happened to pass my
home the other day and stopped to tell me how
much he enjoyed the article

  long before casey took the ill-fated memphis-
canton run he and i were on the same freight
runs between water valley miss and jackson
tenn casey had  hobbies devotion to his
engine desire to maintain schedules and the
sounding of a locomotive whistle one day we
both pulled into jackson yards about the same
time while waiting for clearance casey said
to me  harry if youre ever assigned the 
while im off duty take good care of her

  as for maintaining schedules he taught me a
lesson when i first came to the ics mississippi
div i was pulling a drag out of jackson and
had a wait order to meet casey at lamar tenn
he was running a banana train on special schedule
due at this point  pm i managed to get
my drag into the siding as he roared by right
on the dot later my conductor said the clear-

dept u s express co once the bridge over
green river near colona  was washed out
passengers baggage and express were ferried
across on a raft while nichols was transferring
his safe it fell into the river they had a hard
time recovering it uncle joe said he wouldnt
have cared so much about losing the safe if only
nichols had been tied to it but later he felt
very sad about the murder

  following the crime a man named frank wing
came on the runs as brakeman and baggageman
he was a mixer well liked by the boys later
it transpired he was a pinkerton detective he
did good work on this case-h w chambers

  every cotton-field negro between cairo and
canton could tell when casey jones was at the
throttle his ability to handle a whistle cord
was marvelous his beautiful chime notes start-
ing at a high crescendo trailed off into a whisper
the day casey was killed at vaughan miss he
had just completed a is-barrel whistle and mount-
ed it on the  sim who fired for me for
years after the wreck told me that just before
casey blew for vaughan he called over the
boiler-head  oh sim well sure wake em up
at canton this mornin with the new whistle

  i dont know what became of that whistle i
was assigned the  when she returned from the
shops after the wreck but her whistle was missing
in its stead was a regular ic standard chime
of the type which was then being used to replace
the engineers home-made whistles

  on the night of april   casey had
some trouble coupling into a southbound mail
car he bunted it several times with the 
when he arrived at the poplar st station mem-
phis for no  but couldnt make the coupling
the car rolled downhill but was caught and
brought back to the station before one arrived
if they had failed to stop this car casey prob-
ably would not have been killed as the delay
to one would have made him late enough to
miss the fatal meet with the freight

  in sept  while wm jennings bryan was
campaigning against wm mckinley the repub-
lican presidential nominee the democrats staged
a locomotive collision to raise funds for tbeir

  free silver  cause

  their first step was to get  old brooks engines
-i think they came from the denver  rio
grande-and paint on their tanks the names bill
mckinley and mark hanna his campaign man-
ager perhaps some reader can give the history
of those engines

  a half-mile of track was laid in denver so
that the center was lower than either end thus
giving a down-grade for both antagonists then
a high canvas screen was erected around the
grounds except at the track openings in the
middle of the enclosure an arena was built parallel
to the tracks price of admission was  as
i remember

   many test runs had been made by each engine
 timed to the second so as to meet in the center
 of the arena at length all was set for the big
 thrill a starter stationed in the middle waved
 a white flag both engineers whistled back their
  ready  signals then the starter slowly raised
 a red flag a breathless hush fell over thousands
 of spectators crowding the arena the flag
 dropped the big run was on because of the
 downgrade and no brakes one engine had been
 kept in reverse her reverse lever stuck for a
 few seconds-long enough to spoil the schedule

   at the last minute dummy engineers and fire-
 men had been placed in the cabs with throttle
 wide open bells clanging and whistles screaming
 one locomotive tore into the enclosure instantly
 the spectators realized that the collision would
 take place outside the arena there was a mad
 scramble by those lining the track fences but
 they could scarcely move because they were held
 in by the crowd in back of them when the
 crash came the air was filled with pieces of
 flying metal and glass almost miraculously no
 one was injured what might have been a tragedy
 turned out to be a bad scare

   the engines struck with such force that they
 almost stood on ends and then settled back in
 a rebound that left them standing about  feet
 apart from one boiler front a stream of hot
 water and steam shot into the air like a geyser
 flues and fireboxes of both engines must have

railroad stories

the readers viewpoint

  in saying the bristolian
was the worlds fastest sched-
uled train between  central
points f h of liverpool
erred on the madison div
of the cnw the  cov-
ers the  miles between buffalo and oxford
in  minutes an average of  mph  miles
between brooks and buffalo in  minutes -
mph  miles between highland park and
wilmette eastbound in  minutes  mph
 miles waukegan and kenosha both east and
west ix minutes  mph  miles lake
bluff and wilmette  minutes  mph

  the cnw train is faster than the english
train and for longer distances-martin dignan
 holmes st youngstown o

	 

answering m r

dignan that  miles
at  mph between
control points makes the
bristolians  mph
look tame doesnt it

however england raised
a new stepper when the london  northeastern
adjusted its silver jubilee schedule giving 
minutes to run the  miles between hitchin
and huntingdon northbound which works out
at  mph

  this doesnt look so dusty seeing the  cant
show  mph fort that distance maybe the
detroit arrow coulu id like to know will
somebody check up on an employees timecard
and tell us-f h liverpool england

 the recent controversy be-
tween burlington road execu-
tives and enginemen has been
settled in favor of the em-
ployees  men must be in the
cab of each diesel engine but
firemen are paid by the hour
not on mileage basis

  when swiss federal railroads were electrified
engine crews were cut to one man then came
the crash in lucerne tunnel in which several
lives were lost including the engineer investiga-
tion indicated that the engineer was either dead
or unconscious he was thrown down at a curve
but when his hands left the throttle and brake
safety devices stopped the train had the other
train been a few minutes late a head-on collision
would have happened thereafter passengers made
sure that  men were in the cab before they
would board trains-ernest stalder  byron

  you devote too much space to
foreign roads and too little to

   tenders and also for lining up the centers
   of driving wheels this is how to make it
   take a rectangular piece of steel about
    long  wide and w to i thick
   put tms piece in the chuck of your lathe
   and lace accurately across on one side
   reverse and face the other side your
   block figure no g in the accompanying
   drawing should be the same thickness at
   all points when you have finished machin-
   ing

     now drill  to rs hole about half-
   way through the block this hole is for
   the tool post and should be approximately
    away from one end of the block the
   tool post figure no  may be a piece of
   drill rod  to  long and should fit very
   tightly in the hole you drilled in the block

use it but now well go to the job of
quartering locomotive driving wheels

  press home one driver on each axle
using your vise as a press and pieces of
hard wood or brass between the jaws and
the metal slip an axle through one of the
holes in the frame next place on the
phonograph gear mentioned two months
ago lightly press on the opposite driver
so that its center line is pointing toward
the front of the frame the other driver
should have its center line pointing down-
ward and thus the angles formed by the
center lines of one pair of drivers should
make an angle of  degrees

  when all drivers are in place put the
chassis on a piece of windshield glass
take your surface gage and check all the
drivers on one side to see that their center
lines are vertical and then without touch-
ing the chassis move the surface gage
around to the other side and check the
center lines on that side they should all
form a horizontal line if they all check
press the drivers home

  the function of a pilot truck on a model
locomotive is merely to carry the weight
of its parts and to line up switches and to
help keep the locomotive from leaving the
track on curves but not to carry the weight
of the front end as is the case in a real
locomotive pilot truck

  making one is simple you need two

pairs of wheels one piece of strip brass a
small amount of lead and some -
screws the side frames no  in the
pilot truck drawing are made first cut
them to the size shown in the chart drill
the axle holes about two drill sizes bigger
than the axles to allow for a small amount
of play we suggest you buy your wheels
rather than make them when you receive
your wheels take one off each axle slip on
a washer about  thick put the axle
through the holes place another washer on
the axle and drive home the other wheel

on the left are two photo-
graphs of a simple surface
gage showing the commercial
product white background
and the finished gage de-
scribed in this article black

in the exact center of the side frames drill
two holes no  with a no  drill and
tap the holes with a no - tap a u-
shaped stretcher is made which will just fit
snugly without binding the side frames
this is figure no  in the drawing

  drill two no  holes in the sides of
this stretcher and one hole on the top and
tap them the same size as no  in the side
frames the diagonal lines in the drawing
show where the lead is placed assemble
the truck with no - screws make
sure the lead does not bind the side frames

dont let adoleseent pimples
make vol lose out

 pimples are often a real drawback during
 the years following the start of adolescence-
 from about  to  or even longer

   in these years important glands develop and
 final growth takes place this causes disturbances
 throughout the body the skin becomes over-
 sensitive waste poisons in the blood irritate this
 sensitive skin-and pimples appear

   fleischmanns fresh yeast is often prescribed
 for the correction of these adolescent pimples it
 clears the skin irritants out of
 your blood pimples go

                 eat fleischmanns yeast 
               times a day before meals-plain
               or in a little water-until your
               skin is clear and smooth once
               more start today

  camels

   they are so mild
   they never get my

  at a sicnal the elephants are

 the enraged herd maddened
 by the noise thunders blindly
 into the kraal-

youll like their mildness too
