chapter i

the cipher telegram

 t ig penny pugilist poke

   the station - agent at shunton
hills who was also telegraph operator
baggage-master and general factotum
finished the transcription of the mes-
sage added the signature and craned
his neck out of the window

   hey harry he called to his son
and assistant who was battling with a
pile of trunks down at the far end of
the platform wheres tad

  gone shimming i guess why
 oh theres a sort of gibberish mes-
sage here for daniel g ramsey whos
he i wonder 

  ramsey why that must be the
fellow who came in on the accommo-
dation this afternoon with his family
and all this baggage theyve taken the
old sampson place for the summer and
billy sampson told me he was a big
new york banker whats the message
about leaving his task and coming
forward

   you can see for yourself he held
out the yellow sheet with a grin  its
all right though i repeated it and got
back an ok from the other end
harry glanced at the cryptic words
curiously  why thats in cipher he
exclaimed  and maybe about something
mighty important it ought to be de-
livered at once dad

   maybe so but how is it going to
    a

be done with tad gone drat that
boy hes never around when  he is
wanted

  harry hesitated a moment

   here he cried  let me have it
i can jump on my wheel and ride over
to sampsons and back in less than no
time besides  am very strongly of
the opinion that ramsey would rather
wait for his trunks than for this

  as -he spoke he snatched the flutter-
ing telegram from his fathers hand
crammed it into an envelope and leap-
ing on a bicycle which stood against the
end of the station was pedaling away
a moment later down the dusty country
road

  the station-agent shaking his head
as though deprecating the waste of so
much energy upon a mere supposition
returned slowly to his cushioned chair
and resumed the nap interrupted by the
clicking of his instrument

  he was not an imaginative nor an
energetic man himself this benjamin
rock perhaps if he had been en-
dowed with so much of either quality
as was possessed by his son harry he
would not have been content to round
out his days as agent at the little in-
significant mountain station of shunton
hills

  it was not entirely excess of vim
however which had rendered young
rock so ready to undertake extra duty
nor for that matter the possible impor-
tance of the message either




the argosy

  to tell the truth he had caught a
fleeting glimpse of a smashingly pretty
girl in the party which had alighted
from the accommodation that afternoon
-a dark spanish-like little beauty with
a ravishing smile and cheeks whose color
was like the blush on a nectarine and
what young man of eighteen would not
have been willing to drop his work and
go chasing off  a mile and a half spin
for the chance of a closer look at a di-
vinity like that

  fortune favored him moreover 
his quest for as he turned in at the
old sampson place and wheeled smartly
up the driveway leading to the house
he could see the midnight maiden on
the veranda engaged with one of her
brothers in putting up a hammock

  they were having trouble with one of
the hooks and were both gazing rather
ruefully at the result of their bungling
efforts when harry came up the steps

  he saw what was the difficulty in an
instant

   here he cried impulsively  let
me fix that for you

  and in almost less time than it takes
to tell it he had the trouble adjusted
and the refractory hook hanging nicely

   oh thank you smiled the girl
gratefully  that was awfully clever
of you

  harry blushed as though he had been
caught stealing sheep

  you-you are miss ramsey he
stammered

  she looked a trifle surprised

   yes i am anita ramsey she an-
swered  did you want to see me

   yes maam-er-that is no maam

-	i should-say-

  he ceased to struggle longer with his
embarrassment and for explanation
merely fished the telegram out of his
pocket and extended it to her without
a word

   oh she said glancing at the super-
scription  this is not for me this is
for my father wait a minute and i
will call him

  a moment later the president of the
new york thirty - fourth national
came striding out on the porch the open
message in his hand and his face like
a thundercloud

  harrv rock had made no mistake it

seemed when he ventured the suggestion
that  pig penny pugilist poke
might veil a communication of consider-
able importance as a matter of fact
it was nothing less than an intimation to
the financier that a cabal of his enemies
taking advantage of his absence upon
his summer vacation were about to
spring a well-planned coup to wrest
from him the control of the powerful
institution which he headed

   so fully were their designs perfected
indeed that unless he were able to con-
front them on the morrow and by some
measure turn the tide it was practically
certain that he would be dethroned

  but daniel g ramsey was a fighter
and even as he hurried out upon the
porch a scheme was formulating in his
mind whereby to circumvent the  gang
 you are from the station are you
not   he inquired bruskly of young
rock  tell me what time does the
next train leave for new york

   eight forty-five to-morrow morning
sir

   eight forty-five to-morrow morn-
ing   the other gasped  do you mean
to tell me there are no more trains over
this road this afternoon or to-night  

   oh yes sir-plenty of them but
they are express-trains only the ac-
commodations stop at shunton hills
two a day each way

   but surely one of the expresses
could be flagged  

   i dont know about that sir youd
have to ask my father the station-agent
ive never known of it being done be-
fore though

   well its going to be done now
asserted ramsey decisively  what
time does the next express go through  
 the limited at five-sixteen

   five-sixteen the banker snapped
open his watch  thunderation  shall
have to race to catch it 

  he started toward a buckboard
which fortunately was already hitched
up and standing under a tree beside the
drive

    george he called to his son  run
in the house and bring out my suit-case
anita you can come with me and drive
the rig home

  and as harry rock wheeled more
slowly back to the station the buck-
the time for action



board passed him in a cloud of dust the
horse in a lather of foam as its master
vigorously laid on the whip

   gosh it must be fun commented
the countryman enviously  to get your
blood all stirred up like that because
something has got to be done in a rush
out here in this dead-and-alive old hole
it doesnt generally make much differ-
ence whether a thing is attended to now
or week after next

  yet when he reached the station and
found the banker wrangling with his
father he could hardly have believed
in strict truth that ramsey was greatly
enjoying himself

  the sweat stood out on the city mans
brow he was gesticulating fiercely and
the remarks in which he indulged were
more forcible than polite

  mr rock however remained placid
and unmoved he was one of those
featlier-pillow men upon whom it is al-
most impossible to make an impression
and to his slow brain the idea of flag-
ging the limited was almost as scandal-
ous a suggestion as to propose a revision
of the ten commandments

   no sir he asserted tranquilly
heedless alike of threats expostulation
bribes and entreaty it cant be done
of course i can wire in to headquarters
for permission to stop her if you say
so but i dont believe it would be
granted and anyhow there aint hardly
time to do it now shell be along here
in twenty minutes

  anita ramsey did not of course
know the exact nature of the trouble
which confronted her father but she
could see from his wrought-up and ex-
cited demeanor that it was serious and
that he considered it almost a life and
death matter to catch this train

  consequently when the bright-faced
fellow who had so adroitly fixed her
hammock joined their little group she
turned to him in eager appeal

 cant you do something she
whispered coaxing him with her dark
eyes  i know you can if you only
will

  he shook his head

   i dont think so regretfully

 you see its a pretty serious thing to
hold the limited and my fatherd lose
his job sure if- or stop a minute

a sudden idea coming to him under the
inspiration of her glance  by george
ill stop her for you  he exclaimed

  as he spoke he hurried off down the
platform and pausing only to snatch up
an ax from the baggage-room quickly
disappeared along the track

  a minute or so later there came
sounds of lusty chopping from the di-
rection in which he had gone but the
wrangling disputatious men upon the
platform paid no heed and anita could
only listen and wonder

  presently however there came a loud
crackling followed by a tremendous
crash and as ramsey and the agent
startled by the noise faced sharply
about harry reappeared around the
curve below the station shouting and
waving his arms -

   hey dad he called  i was chop-
ping down that big dead tree along the
right of way that you told me to get
rid of yesterday and it fell square
across the track youll have to flag
the limited 

chapter ii

getting a start

  neither the caustic remarks of his
father nor the swearing of the delayed
trainmen served to abate young rocks
satisfaction over the success of his ex-
ploit indeed the harsh and bitter
words flung in his direction slid off him
like the proverbial water from a ducks
back for mr ramsey apprized by his
daughter of the true reason for the acci-
dent had laid a grateful hand upon his
shoulder before boarding the halted
train and said

   ive not time to talk to you now
my boy but you can rest assured that
ill not forget your work this day and
when i get nack from the city i shall
take occasion to have a more extended
chat with you

  anitas eyes too with their beaming
glances of admiration gave him his re-
ward  so that he worked away uncon-
cernedly to help clear the line indiffer-
ent to the black looks so freely showered
upon him by the railroad people

  that night after supper however
when his father started in afresh with


the argos v

 the observation that abe dorsey the
 conductor of the limited had said if
 it was his boy who had played such a
 trick hed fairly skin the young whelp
 alive harry began to wax impatient

    well he rejoined defiantly  i
 guess id sooner stand in with mr ram-
 sey than with old abe dorsey even if
 he does act like he was lord of all crea-
 tion in that blue suit and brass buttons
 of his

   the elder rock glared at him with
 suddenly confirmed suspicions

   so he snorted you really did it
  purpose and to help out that stuck-
 up new yorker who was pitching into
 your own father for all lie was worth
 i should think youd be ashamed of
 yourself harry

    and now you think  suppose that
 hes going to make it up to you some
 way he went on jeeringly well
 youll find yourself good and mistaken
 if i know anything that kind is
 mighty free with their promises and soft
 sawder until they get what they want
 and then ive noticed theyre always
 too busy to see you

   but his sneering croak failed to si-
 lence the song of elation in harrys
 heart or to dispel the ambitious dreams
 aroused by the bankers parting words
 and the sequel showed that young rocks
 faith had not been misplaced

  when ramsey returned from new
 york his enemies routed and his control
 of the thirty-fourth national reestab-
 lished more firmly than ever he sought
 an early interview with the lad who had
 rendered him such signal service and
 learning during the course of the conver-
 sation that the country boys chief yearn-
 ing was for a wider horizon and a chance
 to make something of himself in he
 world ended by offering him a position
 in the bank

   no small mark of daniel ramseys ap-
 preciation was this either if the shunton
 hills folk had only known it for there
 were many sons of rich men waiting and
 eager to accept even the most minor post
 in the thirty-fourth national in order
 to learn financiering under the tutelage of
 its capable president

   yet so carefully were the qualifica-
 tions and characters of the various appli-
 cants scrutinized that to land a job there

was in effect a certificate of exceptional
merit and ability

  nor for that matter was shunton
hills at all disposed to stick its tongue
in its cheek hitherto it must be con-
fessed the community had rather regard-
ed harry as a  smart aleck because
of his readiness to criticize their slow-
going village ways but when it became
noised abroad that he was  goin to noo
york with that there rich banker whats
took the old sampson place public sen-
timent showed  a marked reversal and
there were not wanting those who
averred they had always prophesied
 somepn good fer so sprv a voung fel-
ler

  benjamin rock it is true predicted
disaster as he shuffled about in his run-
down old carpet slippers and wondered a
fretfully why harry couldnt be content
to let well enough alone

   why that boy is making eight dol-
lars a month and his board he grumbled
to his wife  and i was calculating to
give him a dollar more next year if busi-
ness picks up youd think he ought to
be satisfied with that wouldnt you in-
stead of chasing oif to break himself
down with the hard work they put on
those fellows in the city banks besides
its going to be pretty rough on me for
i declare  dont know where  can find
a helper worth his salt among the worth-
less cubs around here and the result will
be ill have to do the work myself

   however with a shrewd nod  i
guess itll not be long before he comes
sneaking back home again he wont
realize what a snap hes had until after
hes left it for a while the best way to
deal with headstrong young colts like
that is to give them their own way and
let them run for a time after a bit
theyre glad enough to settle down to a
steady trot

  harry however did not  come sneak-
ing back home except for an occasional
brief visit and neither did he break down
under the strain of his new duties

  on the contrary he  made good  
for although he speedily discovered that
a position in a city bank is far from being
a sinecure he was working in an atmos-
phere which suited him intimate in a way
with large transactions and having his
imagination stimulated and inspired
the time for action



every day by the magnitude of the pos-
sibilities offered to ambition by the great
metropolis

  moreover mr ramsey did not lose
sight of him but having taken a strong
fancy to the quick-witted energetic
young fellow watched over his progress
and advanced him as fast as conditions
permitted

  he also not infrequently invited the
lonely country lad to his house for a
sunday dinner or on some similar occa-
sion for there was not a trace of snob-
bishness in ramseys composition and he
believed thoroughly in the good old-
fashioned idea of an employer keeping in
touch with his help

  and after one of these visits harry
rock would return to his dingy little
hall-room on the fourth floor back of a
boarding-house and stretched out upon
its narrow cot would dream of the time
when lie too should be a rich and pow-
erful banker living in a palatial mansion
filled with all sorts of beautiful things

  in these ambitious visions there was
also another character always introduced
-a sprightly lady who appeared to be
the mistress of this home and whose hair
was dark and her eyes sparkling while
the color in her cheeks was like the ripe
blush on the side of a nectarine

  for although he had seen many beau-
tiful women since coming to new york
and had met some of them as he began
to go about more in a social way he had
never once faltered in his opinion reached
the first time he had ever seen her that
anita ramsey was the most beautiful
exquisite fascinating and wholly desira-
ble creature who ever breathed the breath
of life

  so he would go on building his airy
castles in spain and installing her in
them to do the honors until-suddenly
the alarm-clock would go rattling off
beside his ear and he would start awake
to realize that a trial balance was waiting
to be struck off down at the bank and
that as yet his income was hardly suffi-
cient to maintain himself

  however that state of affairs did not
last long with his successive promo-
tions each accompanied by a substantial
raise in salary rock was presently able
to live comfortably to send something
home to his mother and even to lay aside

certain sums-small at first but gradual-
ly increasing in size-as a nucleus for
that fortune he intended some day pos-
sessing

  under mr ramseys advice too he
invested his savings when they grew
large enough-invested them so judi-
ciously that by the time he was twenty-
five and had become the paying-teller of
the bank his personal account at the insti-
tution was one by no means to be sneezed
at

  his habits remained economical
though and he indulged in no splurging
his one idea was to become a master in
the world of finance and some day to
win anita ramsey for his wife toward
that goal he concentrated all his ener-
gies

  anita who was now twenty - three
had been abroad for the last two years
finishing up her education by a round of
travel but harry could see no difference
in her when she returned except that she
was if anything lovelier than ever she
greeted him with the old frank friendli-
ness and seemed to be fully as interested
in his plans and his career as ever but
he noticed that she spoke a good deal of
a certain mr arthur corning whom she
had met on the other side and who had
paid her a good deal of attention on the
score of having been at college with her
brother george

   this mr corning he also learned had
inherited considerable money from his
father but not content to live a life
solely of leisure was shortly coming to
new york to engage in business and
had signified his intention of opening
an office on wall street

   in due time accordingly he arrived
and was introduced to rock at miss ram-
seys one evening the country boy-for
despite his long residence in the city a
good deal of hayseed still clung to the
paying-tellers hair-thought him the
most interesting man he had ever met
fluent polished magnetic graceful and
wras deeply flattered when upon leaving
the house the newcomer hooked an arm
within his elbow and took him for quite
a long walk ending up with a charm-
ing little supper at one of the swell
restaurants

   but that painfully gathered bank ac-
count if it had any prophetic instinct


the argosy

whatever must have shuddered and
grown pale at the thought of that meet-
ing

chapter iii

riotous living

  after that whenever harry rock
called at the ramseys he was almost cer-
tain to find young corning ensconced in
the drawing-room

  in some subtle way too he would be
made conscious of the old adage that
 two is company and three a crowd
and presently flushing with embarrass-
ment he would awkwardly withdraw to
spend the remainder of the evening with
daniel g in the library or playing back-
gammon with sweet-faced gentle mrs
ramsey  her private sitting-room

  generally though when lie would
start to go out lie would be hailed by
corning with the injunction to  wait a
minute  and after a while the other
would join him at the front door and
they would go out for a season of fun
and frolic about the big town

  usually young george ramsey would
form one of the party and perhaps two
or three other  good fellows  would be
added so that since harry was un-
willing to let corning do all the spend-
ing without making some return the ex-
pense footed up considerably and he was
a little worried at times to observe that
his bank account did not grow as fast as
formerly

  nevertheless he solaced himself with
comings favorite phrase about all work
and  play making jack a dull boy and
although he made one or two spasmodic
efforts at retrenchment they were futile
and short-lived

  he had got into the habit of seeking
amusement at the places of gay resort
you see and there is nothing so hard to
break off as a habit even though it be
only as to which stocking one puts on
first in the morning

  nor was it only  the nights that lie
happened to meet corning at mr ram-
seys that harry now went out in fact
he rather neglected the ramseys a bit
for whenever the  crowd  gathered
there was always a proposal of some kind
for the next evening and harry was get-

ting so he could not bear to miss any fun
that was going

  finally one night when everybody had
been wondering what could be keeping
corning away that gentleman appeared
late but in a flush of high spirits and
rapturously announced that he was en-
gaged to anita ramsey

  for a moment it almost seemed to
rock as though a bomb had been ex-
ploded under him he saw all his
cherished dreams and hopes his youthful
ambitions and his castles in the air go
crashing down in one fell overthrow of
destruction

  how blind how imbecile he had been
not to realize before what was in the
wind

  he pulled himself together somehow
however and managed to extend his con-
gratulations with the rest but he excused
himself very shortly afterward  the
plea of having a headache-heartache
would have been more truthful-and for
three nights absented himself from the
assemblages

  he could not blame any one though
he told himself no man could fail to
be enslaved by the beauty and charm of
anita ramsey and it was certainly by
no means wonderful that she should
prefer a dashing attractive suitor like
corning to such a dull and uncouth
fellow as himself heaven be thanked
he muttered that he had never let her
know the silly hopes he entertained

  for three days as has been said he
nursed his wounds in solitude then as
he began to look at the matter in a more
philosophical light although the smart
still endured the force of habit reasserted
itself and he began to yearn for his
customary evenings of excitement

  accordingly he went out and hunted
up the  gang with the result that very
shortly lie was back in the full swing of
his frivolity more madly and merrily
than ever

  with this difference however that
whereas before he had simply refrained
from adding to his bank account he now
dipped deep into the hoarded store

  the object was gone as it seemed to
him for which he had been saving and
planning of what use then was the
money except to give him a good time

  yet it must not be understood that
the time for action



there was anything inherently wrong in
this period of wild oats sowing on the
part of rock he was a more than ordi-
narily clean - minded young fellow and
he rigidly frowned upon any suggested
diversions which touched upon absolute
evil 

  no at the worst his dissipations were
merely idle pleasure-seeking and in an-
other type of man might not have been
considered even blameworthy but it was
because he was of finer metal and of
greater capabilities than his roistering
companions that his conduct must be
judged reprehensible

  he attended to business as faithfully
as ever his handling of the banks funds
was as straight as a string there was
nothing in his behavior upon which his
employers could justly have laid a finger
of criticism yet he was spending more
money than he earned and that is al-
ways dangerous

  yes it certainly cost money to travel
in arthur comings crowd and rock
made it fly as fast as any of them al-
though it must be confessed that even
he failed to equal the lavish prodigality
of corning himself

  for despite his engagement the
young wall street man continued as the
leader the life and soul of their little
coterie the prospect of his new re-
sponsibilities instead of causing him to
settle down actually seemed to render
him more wild and reckless than before

  this too notwithstanding the fact as
rock had heard whispered about down-
town that his free expenditure coupled
with some crippling business losses he
had sustained as a result of his inex-
perience at the wall street game had
seriously impaired his fortune

  still that did not make any especial
difference thought harry anita un-
doubtedly had enough for two and
in all probability corning consoled
himself with the same reflection

  it was this suggestion however which
first turned the bank-clerk a little against
his brilliant friend the sturdy country
boy who had made his own way could
not help feeling a certain contempt for
a chap who having wasted his own
patrimony would be content to sponge
upon his wife for the remainder of his
days

  there were other things too in
comings deportment which of late had
caused him somewhat to temper his
former unqualified admiration nothing
very tangible itis true consisting most-
ly in the adoption of a somewhat coarser
and  sportier  habit of speech and the
occasional introduction into their circle
of more or less questionable acquaint-
ances  but unimportant as these trifles
were they formed for harry a  fly in
the ointment pot and the rift between
the two men was gradually growing
wider

  matters stood about in this shape
when young george ramsey came bus-
tling into rocks rooms one evening
just about dinner-time his face all
aquiver with excitement

   gee he exclaimed throwing him-
self into a chair  but we have been
having a royal old muss up at the
house 	

  harry glanced up with unfeigned
surprise the idea of a  muss  at the
well-ordered ramsey home where every-
thing appeared to run upon oiled wheels
seemed almost a contradiction in terms

 yes we have certainly been having
a merry session went on george con-
senting to explain  you see the old
man dropped on to corning pretty hard
some weeks ago and put the question up
to me as to just what sort of fellow
he was

   well of course i stood up for ar-
thur not only because he is a friend of
mine but also- he hesitated  well
because he is negotiating some business
matters for me which i dont particular-
ly care to have the old man find out
about-

   youre a fool broke in harry se-
verely  what business have you got
that your father shouldnt know to
my mind youd do a great deal better
to consult him and take his advice
whenever you have any transactions on
hand i know it has been dollars and
cents in my pocket to heed what he has
to say

   ok thats all right rejoined
george  another time i would prob-
ably go to him but i am into this thing
and as i say i didnt especially want
him to get next besides you neednt
preach blustering up a bit  i guess


the argos v

you wouldnt care to let him know
where you get all the money you blow
so free nd youre not his son either

  rock was silenced

   well he said less virtuously  you
defended corning and what then

   oh  staved matters off for a
while but to-day the old man came
home all up in the air he said that
lie had convinced himself that corning
was a worthless idle spendthrift and
worse than that was not only an asso-
ciate of some of the shadiest characters
in the financial district but was also
himself engaged in various concerns
which would not bear investigation

 in short he said  mr arthur cor-
ning so far as i can find out is in a
very fair way to land inside states
prison within a short time

   so then of course george pro-
ceeded  dad called anita in and put
her wise to what he hq discovered and
she insisted that arthur be sent for and
given an opportunity to answer the
charges he was game all right and
he attempted to put up a terrible bluff
when she first explained what was want-
ed of him but the old man held the
deadwood on him in the way of proof
and in the end he had to come off his
perch and admit that about everything
they said was true

   then he pleaded desperately for
another chance promised to reform and
went through all sorts of stunts but it
didnt touch anita any more than if she
had been a marble statue she told him
that for some time past she had felt that
she had been mistaken in accepting him
and that her regard for him was less
deep than she had thought but that in
any event she could not dream of marry-
ing a man whom her father failed to
approve or whom she herself could not
respect and with that she handed
him his ring and walked out of the
room

   so the engagement is broken   de-
manded harry excitedly

   of course off for good and all i
know sis and when she takes a stand
of that sort shes just like the old man
an army of ten thousand men could not
force her to budge a hairbreadth

  harrys first feeling was one of dis-
tinct elation the roseate dreams in

which he had formerly indulged but
which of late he had laid away surged
up strong and fresh in his heart again

   anita was free free to be won by
 a man who could command her respect
 and perhaps he had a chance

   he had to turn away his face from
 his companion to hide what was show-
 ing too plainly in his eyes but even as
 he did so a sickening recollection came
 over him as to the state of his bank-
 account he had consulted the ledger
 that morning and had found but forty
 dollars to his credit

   how could he enter the lists when it
 would take him at least five years to
 save enough from his present salary to
 be in a position to propose and how
 could he explain to her father what had
 become of the growing  nest-egg 
 which the latter had helped him to
 gather 

  oh fool fool he had thrown
away his chance to win anita ramsey
through a round of silly extravagances

chapter iv

ox dangerous ground

   for a long time after george ramsey
 left him harry remained alone in his
 room moodily gazing at the carpet
 he had an engagement for dinner that
 evening but it entirely slipped his
 mind somehow he did not care to eat

   yet scourge himself with bitter names
 as he would and rack his brains until
 they fairly burst he could hit upon no
 plan which offered any sort of solution
 to his problem

   without enough to provide for her
 he would be nothing less than a cur
 to attempt to gain any womans love
 and even though anita should be will-
 ing to overlook that and grant her con-
 sent what could he say to her father
 when he asked for his

   would he not have to confess to dan-
 iel g that he had been no less of an
  idle worthless spendthrift  tan ar-
 thur corning

   in his desperation his almost fren-
 zied search for some way of escape out
 of the coil in which he found himself
 caught he even got down his old bank-
 books and laboriously added up each
the time for action

item hoping against hope that he might
discover an error or that in some way
he could make the figures lie

  but it was of course a fruitless
effort the result showed the same de-
pressing figures his available cash as-
sets were an even forty dollars-not ac-
cent less and not a cent more

  at last while he still ruminated dole-
fully over the situation there came a
knock on the door and when harry
stepped over to open it he was surprised
to find upon the threshold no one less
than the man who had played the part
of his evil genius corning himself

  the latter was haggard and upset his
eyes hollow and his hands trembling
slightly with nervousness but he was
evidently trying to maintain his usual
debonair manner

  ah harry he cried to the other
jauntily  this is better luck than i ex-
pected to find you in- still  had a
little stroke of business which i wanted
to talk to you about so i thought i
would take a chance and run over
business repeated harry won-
dering what on earth the fellow could
have in his mind

   ves briskly  to come to the
point  find myself unexpectedly hard
pressed for ready money sounds ridicu-
lous doesnt it but most annoyingly it
happens to le the truth of course i
could dispose of some of my securities
at a sacrifice but i hate to do that for
the small sum i need so i thought i
would see if you would not be willing
to loan me two thousand or twenty-five
hundred for a few days

  rock laughed hollowly

  twenty-five hundred he repeat-
ed  you may believe me or not as
you choose corning but  have been
just running through my bank-bank
and  find  have but little more than
twenty-five dollars

  his tone and expression were such
that corning could not doubt the sin-
cerity of the statement and he too
pulled a long face over such a disap-
pointing check to his plans

   by jove he exclaimed irritably

 that is certainly tough luck with a
vengeance and just when i have a
chance for a killing which would
more than put me on my feet again

    isnt there some way you can raise
the money for me rock he urged
eagerly  ill tell you you raise five
thousand and ill put you on to a way
of making a tidy bunch of money for
yourself

  how is that questioned harry
not without a degree of interested curi-
osity

   why you know ed spear that chi-
cago fellow  introduced you to up on
the roof-garden the other night well
he is interested in horse-racing - of
course merely as a sport though for
lie has slathers of money and he has
tipped it off to me that there is a horse
going to run to-morrow which is sure
to have a good price against it yet
which cant possibly lose as he says
to put a bet down on this one is just
like finding the money

   now if you can only raise five thou-
sand well go in together on the scheme
twenty-five hundred apiece and divide
the profits share and share alike there
wont be less than fifteen thousand dol-
lars in it for each of us spear says the
odds are bound to be as high as six to
one

  but tempting as was the proposal
harry shook his head when the other
had first suggested giving him a chance
to make some money he had thought
reference was made to a legitimate bus-
iness deal and the idea had occurred to
him that he might possibly obtain five
thousand dollars from air ramsey but
it would have to be a sanguine person
indeed who could imagine the president
of the thirty-fourth national as lending
assistance to or even countenancing a
racing speculation no matter how sure
the results promised

   no said harry -regretfully  i
couldnt raise five thousand dollars for
any such purpose as that if i had to be
hung for it

   nonsense scoffed corning  do
you mean to tell me that you couldnt
borrow it from the bank if youd a mind
to

   certainly  could on good secu-
rity but where the mischief am i to
get security for five thousand dollars
that is the question

   ah a shifty gleam showing in his
eye  but i was thinking of your bor-


the argosy

rowing it without security look at the
thousands of dollars passing through
your hands every day whats to hinder
you from holding out enough for our
needs for a few hours no one would
ever know for you could return it be-
fore the bank opened in the morning
and-

  he broke off abruptly harrys hor-
rified expression warned him that it
might not be safe to proceed and he
attempted to turn off the suggestion with
a laugh

   of course i was only joking about
that he said  but lord how i do
wish we could raise that money here
we have the chance of a lifetime yet
we are compelled to pass it up simply
because we both happen to be tempo-
rarily strapped was there ever such
beastly luck

  he dropped his head into his hands
and sat as though in earnest thought
striving to ponder out some way of meet-
ing the exigency when suddenly he
roused up his eyes beaming

   why to be sure  he cried
 strange that i never thought of- -it
before i can borrow the money from
spear will you afgree to stand good
for half the loan if i make the touch
its a mere formality of course for we
can hand him his five thousand as soon
as the race is over

  rock hesitated a moment but finally
nodded assent and said he would how
he could ever pay back twenty-five hun-
dred dollars to spear if the horse should
happen to lose he could not tell but
corning had assured him positively that
it must win and then spear himself
who was a practical horseman must evi-
dently think so or he would not be
willing to advance the money on mere
personal security

  yes he decided he would be a fool
if he failed to embrace this opportunity
so providentially offered why at one
stroke he would recoup all the money
he had squandered and be once more
on easy street on easy street and
free to woo anita

   all right then cried corning
 ill go right down and telephone spear
and make sure hell stand for it hes
up at the dorfwald i guess

  and as he spoke corning was out

the door and half-way down the stairs
harry waited on pins and needles for
his return at one moment he was
scared to death lest spear should grant
the loan the next trembling with ap-
prehension for fear he should refuse

  there was small need however for
the anxious well with which he
greeted comings reappearance for the
latters jubilant face bore its own answer

  oh its all right he said resuming
his seat  i knew it would be ed
spear is one of the whitest boys that
ever stood on two feet he says we
can have the five thousand and welcome
and pay him back after the race or
whenever we feel like it but he says
that in his opinion five thousand wont
be more than car fare to any of us after
that race is over

   that certainly sounds as though he
expected the horse to win doesnt it  
murmured harry

  win why according to him its
just the same as if there wasnt any other
horse in the race but i forgot to tell
you spear says that hell need all the
ready cash he has with him for the big
plunge he is going to take himself to-
morrow  so if he makes the loan to us
he will have to get cashed a chicago
draft which he has wtith him for six
thousand dollars and he was a little
fearful that he might have some diffi-
culty in getting the money

   i told him though that he neednt
worry his head about that if he came
down to the bank to-morrow morning
you would probably cash it for him all
right you will wont you

   why ye-es i guess so faltered
rock scratching his head

  caution was whispering in his ear
and urging him to refuse  but stronger
sounded the voice of a rash optimism
telling him to go in and win back his
money and anita

  yes he decided tell him to
come around and ill cash his draft for
him 

chapter v

what happened to a  sure thing

   rock took an afternoon off the follow-
ing day and accompanied corning and
the time for action



spear down to sheepshead bay never
could he have been content to stay in his
grille-work cage and perform the mo-
notonous round of his duties while a
contest of such importance to him was
being decided

  nor could he wait to hear the news by
ticker or see it flashed out on the bulletin-
boards he must be where he could see
the  gee-gees  go round with his own
eyes aud know that his horse was a win-
ner the moment it passed under the wire

  before he left the bank though he
duly cashed spears six-thousand-dollar
draft counting out the crisp notes and
pushing them across the little glass
counter as calmly and perfunctorily as
though each one were not weighted with
a load of anxious thought

  then when he had turned the business
of his post over to an assistant he hur-
riedly left the bank and slipped around
to a little restaurant where it had been
prearranged they all should meet

  he had been half fearful in a nervous
uneasy way that he should not find them
there for it must be confessed that his
mind wras not quite at peace in regard to
that chicago draft but they were 
hand all right and what is more corn-
ing thrust the five thousand dollars into
bis hand as soon as he appeared

  but what is that for queried
harry  hadnt you better keep it to
make the bet with

   oh i would rather that you placed
it yourself and then you will know it
is all right rejoined the other and for
some strange reason he waxed so in-
sistent  this score that rock finally
yielded

   i wont go into the betting-ring down
at the track though he demurred  it
would be as much as my position is worth
for me to be seen placing a wager of
this size at such a place  f you insist
on my putting the money down arthur
youll have to tell me of some place in
town where i can do it before i go

   oh thats easily arranged spoke up
spear who hitherto had not been taking
any part in the discussion  theres
a pool-room not two blocks above here
where theyll take your bet all right just
tell the man at the door that ed spear
sent you and hell let you in without any
trouble

  vet even with this assurance harry was
a little surprised to discover how easy it
wasfor him to pass within the guarded
precincts he had never visited a resort of
the kind before and from what he had
read of the police having to batter their
way in with axes and sledges had sup-
posed it to be very difficult to gain ad-
mission  yet the doorman merely nodded
to him now and passed him in without a
word

  he did not know however that ar-
rangements had been made for his visit
in advance and that spear and corning
had followed him to the corner below
so as to give a signal to the watching
doorman and indicate that this was the
man they meant

   now observed spear to his compan-
ion with a satisfied grin  you see they
cant ring us in on it if any trouble comes
out of this affair ill simply say that the
teller forged my name and took the
money himself and the facts will tend to
bear me out

  meanwhile rock all unconscious of
the crafty game set up on him was
mounting the winding stairs and pushing
his way past the second guard into the
pool-room

  the afternoon crowd of patrons had
already started to assemble and were
sitting about the stuffy tobacco-reeking
place exchanging reminiscences or in-
dustriously poring over the  dope 
underneath the flaring gas-jets

  they glanced up curiously at the 
stranger and as he had no desire to
be recognized this made him more than
anxious to get away especially as lie
was already far from favorably im-
pressed-with the surroundings

  therefore he hurried up to a man
who seemed to be in some sort of author-
ity and asked if it would be possible
for him to put down a bet on the fourth
race at sheepshead bay

   sure replied the functionary gra-
ciously  just make out a slip with your
initials and the name of the horse you
want to bet on and slide it along with
your bundle into yonder window well
give you official closing odds on your
pick and if you win you can call around
and get your money down-stairs in the
saloon to-night

  obedient to instructions accordingly


the argosy

he prepared to make out the slip
but as he started to write he paused
and bit at the head of his pencil seized
with a sudden qualm of doubt

   by the way he said to the man who
had previously assisted him  have you
a list of the entries for to-days races
 dont want to make a mistake in the
name of my horse you know

   sure weve got a card what race
did you say it was you wanted the
fourth at the bay well here it is
all right

  rock took the sheet of pasteboard
handed him and eagerly glanced at the
printed names

  ah yes he had made no mistake
here it was right at the top of the list
gold heels the name which corning
had so cautiously whispered to him over
at the restaurant fearful lest some one
might overhear and plunge to the  good
thing with a consequent fall in odds

   gold heels harry therefore print-
ed upon the paper in unmistakable print-
ed character added his hastily scribbled
initials and pushed it with the five thou-
sand through the little window

  then without regret he started to
leave the place but to his chagrin he
met at the top of the stairs a man whom
he knew one of the banks heaviest de-
positors

  there was no use trying to avoid him
however and accordingly he took the
hand outstretched to him with the best
grace he could

   ah mr rock the fellow said
 glad to see you this is the first time
ive ever seen you in my little place
i believe well even the best of us like
to play the ponies once in a while

  his place so he was the proprietor
here then

  a great wave of- relief spread over
rock for he saw that it would not be
necessary to return here again and run
the gantlet of those curious eyes in order
to get his winnings

   yes i have been making a bet he
said  and as i expect to win i am
wondering if it would be too much
trouble for you to bring my profits over
to the bank with you when you come in
the morning

  why no certainly not glad to do
it lets see what are you down on

   gold heels in the fourth race at
sheepshead my bet is five thousand
then he hurried on down the stairs

  the proprietor gazed after him with
a coldly speculative gleam in his eye

   five thousand dollars eh  he mut-
tered thoughtfully  i wonder does
that mean he has been tapping the till

  no he decided they dont start
in on that the first time they come
more likely hes got a red-hot tip from
somebody that knows i guess ill have
to buy some of that gold heels stuff
myself hes rated as an old skate its
true but you never can tell when one
of these dead ones will come to life

  meanwhile rejoicing in the comple-
tion of his errand rock was hastening
on to rejoin his companions and hav-
ing met them no time was lost in pro-
ceeding to the track

  during the ride down on the train
and until the time came for his race to
be called he was flushed and excited
talking at random in order to conceal
the secret misgivings which clutched at
his heart feverishly gay and boisterous

  the first three races of the day held
small interest fohim since to his mind
they only served to prolong the agony
of his waiting but he pretended to be
vastly entertained by them and stood
about trying to ape spears professional
manner of discussing the performances

  it was anything to keep himself from
thinking to drown the still small chi-
ding voice of his conscience to prevent
a breaking and giving way under the
strain which rested on him

  and then at last his heart gave a great
thrill and stood still for the bugle had
sounded and the horses were coming
out for the fourth race

  mincing and prancing the satin-
skinned thoroughbreds with their dimin-
utive riders atop paraded in front of the
stands

   there he is  whispered corning
tensely as he clutched at rocks arm
 thats gold heels the one with the
boy up in the red-striped jacket look
at the baby thats going to bring home
the coonskins to you 

  thereafter harry had eyes only for
that one horse stiff in his seat with
his head bent forward and his hands
clutching his chair until the knuckles
the time for action



turned white he glued his gaze upon
the red-striped jacket and kept it there

  during the fretful moments at the
barrier he suffered a thousand pangs
and apprehensions

  what if his choice should be kicked
and injured by one of those other cur-
veting horses what if he should be
left at the post oh what if a hundred
things might happen

  but at last the webbing flew up and
to the music of a thunderous roar from
lawns and stands they were  off 

  a moments mixup at the turn as the
striving jockeys fought for position and
then the red-striped jacket flashed out
in front

  what did i tell you cried spear
with swelling exultation  him all the
way home why hell lead the rest
of those dogs by all the distance from
iiere to new york

  but harry was unable to articulate
a word he could only sit still and
follow with fascinated gaze the swift
onward flight of horse and rider

  at the half  and the red-striped jacket
was still in front his mount galloping
resolutely steadily as though he still
had oceans of speed to spare

  the three-quarters and still he was
in the lead true the others were creep-
ing up a bit but spear readily explained
this by pointing out that the boy was
gathering him up in preparation for the
sprint home

  in the stretch with the red-striped
jacket still in front the craning throng
was already beginning to shout and ges-
ticulate and call the horses name

  suddenly there flashed out from be-
hind a wiry little sorrel who with a
burst of tremendous reserve speed came
on to contest the supremacy

  already his nose was at the others
withers at his shoulder at his throaf
creeping up veritably inch by inch

  true the first horse was still in the
lead and the wire not a dozen strides
away but how many a turf-battle has
been lost in that narrow margin

  for a moment longer they fought it
out grimly desperately then the little
sorrels nose pushed by the others muz-
zle and the boy in the red-striped jacket
seeing the fight was lost ceased to ply
his whip

  his mount faltered lost his stride
and fell back into the ruck

  harry rock gazed at corning with
stony almost incredulous eyes the
 sure thing  was hopelessly beaten and
their five thousand dollars irrevocably
lost

chapter vi

         n

another loser by the tip

  it is the hardest-hit fellow who makes
the least fuss a chap who yells blue-
murder when he stubs his toe will re-
ceive his death-blow with calm dignitv

  so now although two-dollar  pikers 
were squealing and cursing all around
him rock maintained a very fair sem-
blance of equanimity

  true his face was very pale and he
could not control a certain nervous
twitching about the corners of his
mouth but his voice was steady and he
even managed to summon up a smile as
he replied to spears voluble excuses and
apologies for the failure of the tip

   no one can blame you mr spear
he said quietly  we all went into the
affair with our eyes open and should
have known even if we didnt seem to
that there is no sure thing in horse-rac-
ing we have lost and that is all there
is to it except to settle up  owe you
twenty-five hundred dollars and  re-
gret to say i cannot pay you at once
but if you will call around at my rooms
to-night i will try to arrange some se-
curity for you and fix it so that i can
reduce the obligation by degrees

   oh thats all right rock returned
the other with magnificent indifference

 dont you worry your head old man
but pay me when you feel like it per-
haps we can dig up a horse this week
which will pull us all out more than
even

 not for me said harry decidedly

 i am done once and for all

  so well every fine to his own
liking but  always feel as though 
wanted to get my money back from the
hole where  sank it

   and that reminds me rising from
his chair  that if i want to put a bet
down on this next race ill have to be
getting into the ring


the argosy

   i guess ill go along announced
corning wont you come harry
we can pike a little and get that much
fun out of it anyway

  but harry shook his head he had
made up his mind never again to be
tempted to bet on a horse-race no matter
how small the wager and when harry
rocks mind was made up in that way it
was made up for keeps

  he accompanied the others though
ifrom the stand down on to the lawn and
stood there while they went on into the
betting-ring

  a couple of men strolling by just then
stopped and gazed after the retreating
figures of corning and his companion

   there goes that dirty tout of an ed
spear remarked one of them with a
frown  its a wonder to me he hasnt
been ruled off the grounds for all the
crooked work hes done

   it is indeed assented the other
cordially  whos the new sucker hes
got in tow now  

   oh i guess you neednt waste any
sympathy on that one i see him down
here with spear a good deal lately and
i guess from all appearances hes pretty
well tarred with the same brush

  then they passed on and harry was
left to digest the information thus fortui-
tously vouchsafed

  at first he was inclined to be angry
and told himself that the opprobrious
term used was probably only a sneering
way of speaking of a business enemy or
turf rival

   why he argued  no one could
have been more considerate than spear
was in regard to that two thousand five
hundred dollars the very fact that he
told me to pay at my own convenience
shows that he must be a man of wealth
no mere tout could afford to loan that
much money in the first place or to let
it hang over in the second

  but then it suddenly occurred to him
where the morfcv had come from with
which spear had been so generous

  if that chicago draft should happen
to be returned the alleged horseman
could not be held for a minute he
would simply be a thousand dollars to
the good and the bank would look to its
official who had cashed such flimsy paper
for the amount

  whew harry began to look grave
the more he considered all the circum-
stances connected with the transaction
the less he liked the appearance of it

   and suppose the draft did come back
 what then how was he going to raise
 six thousand dollars to take it up he
 would lose his job sure

  more than that if the bank ever
dropped to the fact that he had got a
part of the spoils he would be prosecuted
and sent to prison oh this was a lovely
kettle of fish he had got himself into

   but he tried to tell himself all this
 was needless alarm and apprehension
 the draft was probably all right

   probably of course it was all right
 this time next week he would be laugh-
 ing over the idea that it had ever caused
 him a moment of anxiety

   thus desperately and it must be con-
 fessed somewhat unsuccessfully trying to
 hearten himself up as he paced along the
 lawn harry all at once caught sight of
 young george ramsey rushing wildly
 hither and thither through the crowd his
 face white and his hair disheveled

    hey george he hailed and the
other turning saw him and came quick-
ly forward

    have you seen anything of spear 
 he demanded excitedly

  spear that name was fast be-
coming a nightmare  why yes  he
went into the betting-shed a little while
ago with arthur corning

    well hes not there now and whats
 more i cant find him anywhere about the
 grounds and ive got to find him
 harry if i dont i am ruined 

   georges voice rose almost to a shriek
 as he finished and fairly beside himself
 he was starting to chase off once more on
 his quest through the crowd but rock
 reaching out laid a hand on his shoulder
 and turned him sharply about

    look here george he said sternly
  whats up between you and spear
 have you been betting on their sure
 thing 

    yes or at least i thought i was
betting but it turns out now that i did
not have down a cent

    well in heavens name what are
you kicking about then you ought to
be thanking your lucky stars that your
money was not burned up


tik timk for action



   oh but you dont understand spear
is a scoundrel he touted me-harry
winced at the word- he touted me
against this horse so hard that i was
wild to play it but  didnt have any
money i had been losing pretty heavily
down here with him before you see then
he and corning got hold of me and told
me that although they were too short to
lend me any money themselves they could
fix it with a bookmaker to hold me up
for the bet and not press his claim inside
of six months provided i could furnish
him some good security well i knew
i could easily make up the amount in
that length of time so i gave them some
railroad bonds which are as good as gold
and-

  railroad bonds broke in rock
struck by a sudden suspicion  where
did you get any such things  

  for he knew that at the pace they had
all been going young ramsey would long
since have hypothecated any negotiable
securities in his possession

   oh i had them evasively  hut
what business is that of yours you
dont have to know all about my re-
sources do you  

  but harry was not to be put off

   where did you get those bonds
george he insisted gripping down
hard upon the others shoulder

  and although the boy tried to act
haughty and indignant at first he pres-
ently broke down under the continued
pressing and admitted that they were
not his own

   the old man gave them to anita for
a present once he confessed sullenly
 fen of them for a thousand dollars
each and she kept them in the back of
her little jewel safe never looking at
them except twice a year when she would
get them out to cut off the coupons and
let the old man collect the interest for
her

   well when spear and corning got
me all up in the air over this horse and
i was casting about every which way to
lay my hands on some security all of a
sudden the thought of these bondsoc-
curred to me i knew that i could get
them back all right the semiannual in-
terest having just been collected sis
wouldnt dream of looking at them for
another six months and even though my

horse lost i would easily be able to re-
deem them in that time so--sg he
faltered   borrowed them without let-
ting anita know and put an envelope
full of blank paper in their place

  rock did not attempt any moral stric-
tures or reprehension at this time the
thing to do now was to get the mess
straightened out as soon as possible

  besides he felt somehow as though the
cloak of a preceptor would not fit alto-
gether easily upon his shoulders

   and has this bookmaker the bonds
now he inquired quickly

  the bookmaker no fairly wailed
george panic again seizing upon him
 that is tvhat i have been trying to tell
you after the race i went to the book-
maker to have a talk with him and make
sure that the bonds would be held until
i could redeem them and he told me that
no such collateral had ever been placed
in his hands  why he said  that
crook of an ed spear has simply soaked
them down into his own wallet if youre
wise young man youll lose no time in
laying hands on him and getting back
your stuff for i tell you straight lies
nothing better than a thief and ten thou-
sand is a pretty tidy haul 

  nothing better than a thief the
words rang upon harry rocks ears like
the sound of a death-knell and a chill-
ing grip seemed to settle about his heart

  his misgivings in regard to that draft
then had not been mere fanciful alarms
it would undoubtedly be returned from
chicago and he was a ruined man

  in an instant he was as wrought up
and agitated as george himself

  yes he exclaimed distractedly you
are right we must get hold of spear
at once 

chapter vii

a council of war

  heedless whom thevjostled and of
the curious looks cast in their direction
the two young fellows wild-eved and
with drawn faces dashed hither and
thither through the crowd

  around the betting-ring they tore dis-
regarding repeated injunctions from the
police to  keep to a walk and thereby
almost getting themselves arrested they


the argosy

raced over the stands and paddock in-
quired at the stables and even investi-
gated the  field where the cheaper
 sports  are accustomed to congregate

  but nowhere did they catch a glimpse
of the man who had  done  them nor
run across any tangible clue to his where-
abouts

  once when they stopped to make ex-
cited inquiry of a waiter behind the pie-
counter the gentleman who had first
aroused harrys suspicions by referring
to spear as a  tout  happened to be
standing close at hand and the boys
overheard him remark to his companion

   ah a couple more of spears vic-
tims evidently and they look as if they
had been well stung too i hope they
will catch the cur and give him what he
deserves but theyll have to look sharp
if they expect to do it i heard last
night that he had all his plans laid to
slip away to europe its getting a bit
too hot for him on this side of the water

i	fancy

  harry wheeled about on his fellow-
sufferer struck by a sudden thought

   george he asked quickly  were
those bonds of yours readily negotiable

   readily negotiable well i should
rather say so they were payable to
bearer anybody could have got the
money on them

  rock gasped the possibilities were
getting more interesting every minute
with a thousand dollars in currency in
his pocket and ten thousand dollars more
in securities which were just as good as
cash there was evidently no reason why
spear should postpone for a single day
his projected departure to foreign climes

  a thief does not usually delay long in
his flitting when he has the swag safely
in hand

  there was one point in their favor
however the rascally tout did not
know as yet of course that they had
fallen wise to his duplicity

  he would argue that harry believing
him to be a wealthy man would not
think of questioning the draft until after
it had gone to chicago and come back a
proceeding which would take several
days and that a still longer time must
elapse before george became cognizant
of the bold swindle practised upon him

  hence it was highly probable that un-

less his suspicions became arouseck by
some untoward event the scamp would
to a certain extent take his own time in
making his  get-away

   as these considerations presented them-
 selves to harrys mind he ceased his aim-
 less rushing about and dragging his
 companion into a secluded corner urged
 him too to desist from the fruitless quest
 and to try and regard the situation in a
 calmer and more judicial spirit

    look here george he said forcibly
  we are making a couple of confounded
 idiots of ourselves it ought to be plain
 to any one by this time that neither
 spear nor corning is any longer on the
 grounds yet we go chasing about like
 chickens with our heads cut off not only
 to no purpose but what ig worse attract-
 ing a lot of curious attention to ourselves
 the one thing above all others we should
 most sedulously avoid how long do
 you suppose it will be before some friend
 of spears drops on to the fact that wre
 are looking for him and hurries off to
 report and if that ever happens the
 fat will be in the fire and no mistake

    but what else can we do objected
 george feeling that any sort of action
 was preferable to an idle sitting down
 upon the stool of repentance

    i must find him and get back my
bonds he repeated desperately for about
the hundredth time you heard what
that man said just now harry spear
is liable to be off to europe at any mo-
ment and then what sort of a pickle
wpuld i be in 

    and do you imagine that he will
delay his sailing because he happens to
hear that you are searching for him
questioned rock with withering sarcasm
 far from it my young friend that
is just about the one thing which would
lend an especial celerity to his move-
ments

   no if we are going to overhaul
this artful dodger and succeed in ma-
king him disgorge we have got to be
wary and circumspect not go hunting for
hinf with a brass band and a drum-major
at the head of it
k  now what i propose is that we im-
mediately efface ourselves from here and
go quietly back to town to take up the
pursuit afresh there

   and how shall we set about it
the time for action



 queried george dubiously  report the
 affair to the police and let them take up
 the trail

  no i dont believe i would advise
that just yet a while of course it
may be necessary to go to them in the
end but you know what a lot of notori-
ety it entails and  for one am by no
means convinced that if we play our
cards right we cannot satisfactorily han-
dle the business for ourselves

  they had passed out at the gate by
this time and with the crowd surging
all about them and the possibility of
some of spears friends being at their
very elbows there was no chance for
further conversation until they had
boarded the train for new york

  seated at last in a parlor-car cn route
to the city however and with their
heads bent close together rock proceed-
ed to elucidate his plans

   in starting out to run down this
crook he said  it seems to me that we
ought as far as possible to put ourselves
in his place and try fairly to consider
what we would do under like circum-
stances

  now here is a chap with a lou of
stolen booty in his pockets and the
natural inference would be it is true
that he is going to get himself out of the
way as speedily as possible but on
the other hand we must remember he
does not think that his victims are aware
of the fact they have been buncoed or
are likely to discover it until a consid-
erable time shall elapse you for several
months perhaps and me-

  he caught himself  sharply together
with a frown but george had noted the
slip of the tongue and exclaimed with
eager curiosity

  you do you mean to say that he
got you too

   never mind about that now im-
patiently if he did get me it was
for nothing like the amount for which
he landed you nor was it by any such
openly criminal act

   but at any rate as i was saying
lie is apt to be fairly comfortable in his
mind and feeling that there is no par-
ticular cause for haste will arrange his
departure to suit his own convenience
in the meantime making no change in
his regular routine

   	a

  under ordinary circumstances there-
fore if i wanted to find him i would
simply visit one after another of his
usual hang-outs until i finally ran across
him but as the case stands now that
doesnt seem exactly advisable for two
good reasons

  what are they

   well in the first place our ill-ad-
vised actions at the track may have put
him on his guard so that he is avoiding
an appearance in public and hurriedly
getting ready to fly

   and the other reason  

  an expression of grim determination
showed upon rocks resolute counte-
nance

   simply that when i do have it out
with that gentleman i want to be where
our interview shall run no danger of
being interfered with by bystanders or
the authorities neither your bonds nor
my money can be got back by law with-
out publicity and scandal but i think 
-significantly-t can get them back--
that is your bonds to a certainty and as
much of my money as he has left

   but how will you locate him  
asked george you dont know where
he lives do you and as yu have al-
ready said to go around asking questions
would only serve to put him on his
guard

   true so i am going to act on the
old principle for hunting snakes they
always travel in pairs you know and if
you can locate the haunt of one the
other is pretty sure to put in a speedy
appearance also now as you say i
dont know where spear hangs up but
i am pretty well acquainted with com-
ings apartments and there is where i
am going

 corning  ejaculated the boy  oh
i say harry you dont really believe
that arthur was in on the deal do you  
rocks frankly contemplated laugh
was not exactly pleasant to hear

   believe it  he said  why george
ramsey if the angel gabriel himself was
to try and tell me that chap was on the
square id have to give him the lie

   in on the deal   he continued
 id be willing to make a good-sized
wager that the two of them are sitting
in some restaurant at this very second
jollifying over the complete way in


the argosy

which they have trimmed us and ar-
ranging for a division of the spoils

    and as a consequence of this little
celebration i will be able to nail them
dropping once more into his explanatory
tone  you know how corning is al-
ways wants to return to his room after
dinner to primp up a bit before starting
out again or even if he should be
scared and ready to skip it is certain he
will want to go back there to get some
of his things and so it is ten to one
in any event that spear will return with
him

   that will be my opportunity for
while they are at dinner i propose to
ensconce myself in the apartment and
be on hand ready to greet them when
they arrive

   but of course you want me to go
with you

  no i think perhaps i can handle
the situation better alone you go on
quietly home and pretend to have a sick
headache so that thefolks will not sus-
pect that anything is wrong from that
graveyard face of yours i will drop up
later to let you know the success of my
mission

   but good heavens harry suppose
they should get nasty on your hands
they would be two to your one

   not so i also will be two-myself
and a trusty little friend that i shall
pick up at my lodgings and carry with
me in my hip-pocket

   as he finished the train whistled into
long island city and the passengers
started to rise to their feet the time
for action had come

chapter viii

  what the eavesdropper heard

  rock with the other members of the
 crowd had often gathered at com-
ings apartments for a jolly evening or
to discuss plans and arrangements for
some impending frolic and he conse-
quently knew the place like a book

  it was a luxuriously fitted-up bach-
elors  two and a bath  at the fashion-
able martingale and as it was on the
second -floor the tenants visitors used
the stairs or the elevator impartially in
order to reach it

   in the present instance harry chose
 the stairs as the more inconspicuous mode
 of approach and also in order that the
 elevator-boy might be able to return a
 truthful denial if corning should ask
 whether anybody had called during his
 absence

   thus he finally arrived without en-
 countering any undue obstacles and so
 far as he could tell unobserved at the
 door of the suite discovering to his re-
 lieved elation that owing to the warm
 weather the transom overhead had been
 left open

   he had brought a twisted wire with
 him and had fully intended to pick the
 lock if necessary despite the danger of
 being caught at such questionable work
 but the open transom made a way of
 ingress for him as though arranged 
 purpose and relieved him of the ticklish
 alternative

   accordingly after listening to satisfy
 himself that the cage was empty and the
 birds still away he drew himself up to
 the aperture wriggled through and
 dropped lightly to the floor on the other
 side

   but once there and after a glance
 around he changed somewhat the plan
 of action he had formulated for himself

   the original purpose he had conceived
 was to hide in the bedroom until the
 two men had returned and were well in-
 side the apartment when he would sud-
 denly disclose himself and enforce his
 demands at the point of the revolver

   now however as the idea occurred to
 him that they might not both come at
 the same time or even if they did
 might between themselves indulge in
 some talk which it would be wise for
 him to hear a better suggestion offered
 itself and he decided to delay such pre-
 cipitate action

   a patent bed-couch with a handsome
 cover on it stood at one side of the front
 room and stooping down to examine it
 rock perceived that there was ample
 space under its light iron framework for
 a man to lie in comfort while the over-
 hanging mattress and coverlid would
 serve most effectually to conceal his pres-
 ence from the view of any one in the
 room

  down upon hands and knees harry
 v dropped and crawling into the retreat
the time for action



 arranged himself as easily as possible to
 await the coming of the enemy

  but a long time passed before his irk-
some vigil came to an end

  surely that  jollification dinner 
must consist of many courses or was ft
perhaps that the tricksters were so ex-
ultant over their coup they had decided
to make a night of it

  then again anxious doubts and ap-
prehensions would arise as to the possi-
bility of their never returning true
the apartment showed no evidences of
any hurried flight on the part of its
owner yet that might simply mean that
he had never come back there from the
race-track but tipped off that the pur-
suit was on had abandoned all his be-
longings to their fate and vamoosed

  mingled with these queries too were
anxious speculations as to what the out-
come of the forthcoming encounter with
the sharpers-provided they did put in
an appearance-would be

  would he be able to recover the bonds
would he get back any of the money
advanced upon the draft and if so how
much 

  again what action would the bank
take upon his case should he fail to ob-
tain any of the money what would
daniel g ramsey think of him when
all the facts came to light and-most
harassing question of all-what would
anita think

  oh harry had plenty to occupy his
mind even though his period of sus-
pense was lorig protracted

  but at last there came the sound of
footsteps from the corridor outside the
click of a key in the lock and corning
entered accompanied to harrys intense
satisfaction by spear

  everything was turning out exactly
as he had predicted to george he told
himself not without a certain pride in
his powers of deduction

  he was also pleased to discover that
by lying close to the floor he could get
with one eye a full view of the room
from under the edge of the couch thus
enabling him to see as well as to hear

  so with his one eye and both ears
alert and the revolver in his hand ready
for action he lay there quiet as a mouse
and waited for what might happen

  from the very manner of the rascals

in entering the room though as well as
from their subsequent words and actions
he perceived that there was no ground
for his fear lest they should have been
already alarmed -the idea of any im-
mediate reprisals on the part of their
plundered victims was evidently the last
thought that came into their heads

  indeed both of them were in jubilant
mood laughing and jesting as might fel-
lows who had dined well and were with-
out a care in the world

  corning hummed a gay little air as he
moved about turning on the lights and
setting the room in order while his
companion standing in front of the
mantelpiece thrust his hands down deep
into his pockets and jingled his keys in
thoroughly complacent fashion

  of a sudden though he paused in his
careless tintinnabulation and glanced
quickly toward the other

   i say arthur he questioned
 youre sure there couldnt possibly be
any mistake about the value of those
bonds eh im not very familiar with
junk of that sort you know

   oh no as i told you theyre as
good as gold however let me see them
again and make sure

  out of spears side coat-pocket came
a bulky envelope which he tossed over
upon the table and for a moment the
hand of the unseen watcher tightened
upon his revolver and he was almost
ready to burst from his concealment then
and there but he restrained himself
with an effort and waited for further
developments

  mistake smiled corning skim-
ming with practised eye over the en-
closed securities  if i had a barrel
or two oftidy little documents like these
i could make the thirty-fourth national
look about the size of a tin savings-bank
oh no edward never underestimate
those beauties theyre worth every
cent they call for and then some
spears heartfelt sigh of relief was
almost laughable

   well im mighty glad to hear it
he declared emphatically  things have
been going so rotten bad with me and
you lately in everything weve under-
took that i began to get afraid maybe
those bonds were on the  bumski too
but since you say theyre all right


the argosy

theres no reason why we shouldnt get
em cashed to-morrow and sail on the
cavonia on wednesday maybe things
break better for us on the other side
and anyway the sooner we get blue
water between us and this job the better
ill be satisfied

   oh whats the use of getting
frightened  rallied his partner  there
isnt one chance in a hundred that
george ramsey will drop to the game
and even if there was he dont dare kick
up a row he stole the bonds himself
no who from how do you
know  

  he took them from his sister anita

i know they are hers because she told
me about them herself answered corn-
ing  strange how things work around
he added musingly  it must have
been intended by fate that these bonds
should come to me in one way or an-
other here take them thrusting the
packet back into the envelope and hold-
ing it out

   oh no if youre going to market
them to-morrow youd better keep them
overnight i dont suppose theres any
danger of burglars in a place like this 
hardly smiled corning the
night watchman is always around and
the help are exceptionally honest as
you say too i guess it would be best
to keep them here

  and with that he stepped over to his
desk dropped the envelope in a drawer
and carefully relocking the receptacle
resumed his seat

  spear fidgeted about a second or two
then somewhat deprecatingly started
afresh on his plea for an early departure

  no matter how sure we are about
george ramsey he urged  i never-
theless think it will be good sense for
us to take that cavonia when she pulls
out on wednesday suppose rock
should get to thinking over matters and
have the bank wire an inquiry out to
chicago about that draft

   well do you know what would hap-
pen replied corning mr rock
would simply land behind the bars a few
days earlier as i have already ex-
plained to you they can do nothing to
you on account of that affair but they
can sotk him and you may rest assured
theyll do it

  in order to clinch the matter i
wrote an anonymous letter to the direc-
tors of the bank to-night warning them
of their paying-teller and informing
them that he had placed a five-thousand-
dollar bet at max snooks pool-room this
afternoon

  the tout stole a sidewise glance at
his friend and scratched his head

   why are you so down on that poor
sucker arthur   he queried  you
and he have been pals too in a way
havent you yet there is nothing tot
bad for you to hand out to him whats
the answer 

   oh i despise the clodhopper 
broke out corning a dull flush of rage
streaking his face  so would you
too if youd had to have a lout like that
held up to you as a model and a para-
gon  

   held up to you by whom

  the angry man hesitated a second

   by anita ramsey he burst out
 by jove spear that girl is in love
with him-always has been in love with
him  she doesnt know it herself maybe
but it didnt take me long to find it out
after i got engaged to her it was
harry this and harry that until i grew
so sick of hearing his name that i swore
id fix her pink of perfection for her
and i guess he added vindictively
 that ive about succeeded although at
that with a wry face  i wouldnt bet
ten cents that she didnt eventually
marry him jailbird or no jailbird

   well since theres a woman between
you i dont wonder so much any more
granted spear  but before im free to
confess i couldnt understand it for he
always struck me as a pretty nice young
chap indeed i havent got any hard
feelings against him now except for the
fact that we let him bet that five thou-
sand dollars- instead of holding on to it
ourselves

    strange how i got such a fool notion
into my head that that horse couldnt be
beat he muttered shaking his head
  thought we could make more by let-
ting him win from the books first and
then taking his winnings away from him 
but the durn combination didnt pan out

   i wrent bad on that dope just as i
did afterward on senator boy in the
fifth race and to-
the time fur action



  corning broke in upon him with a
quick glance of interrogation  then
you lost the extra thousand you got from
rock too   he asked

   oh yes every cent of it

   and all we have is these bonds 

   thats it and thats why i say we
ought to sail at once theres no
chance to do business here any more so
the sooner we get to the other side the
better off well be

  a moment before the pulses of the
man concealed under the couch had been
thrilling and bounding with exultant
happiness for he had that surest proof
in the world the word of his rival and
enemy that the woman he loved loved
him

  but now the triumph and the joy
turned to ashes in his mouth and he
saw standing before him the open door
of a felons cell

  there was no chance upon earth to
recover the money paid out upon that
worthless draft

chapter ix

the catcher caught

  in his rage and desperation at the
plight in which he found himself see-
ing nothing ahead except ruin and dis-
grace it is the greatest wonder in the
world that rock did not dash forth
from his hiding-place and with the
loaded weapon in his hand end the ca-
reer of arthur corning then and there

  and indeed until his dying day
that scurvy villain will never be closer
to breathing his last three separate
times harry stiffened his muscles for
the spring three separate times his fin-
ger was curled tight about the trigger
three separate times his lips were
framed to the shout which should an-
nounce his onset

  but in the end the tense limbs re-
laxed the finger lifted from the trigger
the shout remained in his throat he
lay back weak from the struggle quiv-
ering in every fiber the sweat standing
out in great beads upon his brow

  but one impulse had restrained him-
the thought of anita first lest her
name might become involved owing to
the admissions corning had just made

to spear second because he had it in
his power now by relinquishing his ven-
geance to save her dearly loved brother
from the scandal of a tarnished name

  only by his keeping still at the pres-
ent time could the bonds be recovered
without publicity and disgrace to george

  accordingly he lay back clenching
his teeth and gripping his hands to com-
mand his self-control until at last after
some further desultory conversation
corning proposed a visit to one of the
roof-gardens and the other acquiescing
they took their hats and left

  hardly had the door closed upon
their departing figures before harry was
out from under the couch and across the
floor to the desk which stood beside a
window

  a moments examination of the lock
by the light of a match and then setting
deftly to work with his pocket-knife and
piece bf twisted wire he soon had the
receptacle open

  nor had he to rummage long for what
he sought he had watched corning
carefully when the latter put the bonds
away so now his hand closed almost in-
stantly upon the precious envelope

  nothing now remained but to get
away his task was done

  but first he must make sure that there
was no mistake so he lighted another
match and held it as he hurriedly ran
over the contents of the package

  yes this was what he wanted beyond
question ten railroad bonds of the
value of one thousand dollars each all
in the envelope and all in good con-
dition and now at last he could go

  but just at that moment a window
flashed up on the other side of the court
across from comings apartment and a
shrill feminine voice fairly split the air
with shrieks of  burglars burglars 

  startled and dismayed for he realized
that it must be to him attention was
being directed rock wavered an in-
stant uncertain just what to do then
it came to him that to remain there in
the room beside the rifled desk would
be fatal

  even though lie was known as a
friend of corning he would necessarily
find a situation of that sort difficult to
explain no he must try to get away
whatever the hazard


the argosy

  swiftly he flew to the door and tried
the knob hoping that corning might
possibly have failed to turn the key on
the outside but the hope was vain
the door held and there was no time
to pick the lock for the entire house
was in a turmoil now the screams of
women and children resounding from
every floor

  it was plain therefore that he must
go as he had come and that he had bet-
ter lose no time about it either with
a quick spring he drew himself up to the
transom opening climbed through and
was just about to drop into the corridor
when there came a howl of triumph
from up the hallway and two lusty por-
ters charging forward bore him to the
ground underneath their combined
weight

  harry was not greatly injured by the
fall for he was lithe and wiry and able
to stand a good deal of rough handling
but it seemed to him as though he should
be crushed into a pancake before he
could persuade the two men to remove
themselves from off his chest

  he was sadly out of wind when he
was at length dragged to his feet but
he made a fair stagger at a smile of
quizzical amusement

   i guess i have been the cause of
considerable trouble here he said
 and i can hardly blame you fellows
for taking me for a burglar but you
understand of course that i am a friend
of mr comings and that when he
locked me in his room for a lark the
only way i could get out was through
the transom its all a joke boys just
a big joke

  they were plainly skeptical

   aw come off  growled one of
them  youll have to dig up a better
one than that hold him there bill
until i get the pass-key and see whether
there maynt be another of em still in-
side the room

  now what harry was more anxious
to avoid than anything else was to have
the condition of the desk discovered
and he therefore insisted so vehemently
that the affair was all a joke and that
he could prove a clean bill of health
if they would send for mr keer the
proprietor of the hotel who knew him
that the men aided thereto by sugges-

tions from the crowd of guests and wait-
ers who had gathered by this time finally
yielded so far and a messenger was ac-
cordingly despatched for mr keer who
was at the home of a friend a block
or twro away

  presently word came back that the
proprietor was engaged in a hand of
 bridge  at the moment but would be
over as soon as the rubber was played
out

   while they were all waiting however
the regular policeman on the block
having heard of the disturbance came
nosing about and stood regarding rock
with a severe and cynical disfavor

   suddenly a gleam of quick suspicion
showed in his eye and with a movement
as quick as a cats he twitched out of
the prisoners pocket that significant
strand of twisted wire

  a joke is ut he observed with
lofty disdain  begorra theres a la-ad
down in part fo-our iv th criminal
co-oorts that im thinkin cd take th
measure iv this joker in iligant style

 tin years fr yours is his favrite bit
iv pleasanthry

  this circumstance naturally turned
the sentiment of the bystanders against
the prisoner but he still asserted so
vigorously his claim that it was a joke
and showed such evident willingness to
face mr keer that final decision was
withheld in most minds until the pro-
prietor should appear and pass his ver-
dict

  and then there came a quick murmur
along the corridor at which harry hope-
fully raised his glance expecting to be-
hold the landlords familiar visage
but instead around the corner came-
coming

  if the earth had opened beneath him
in a cataclysmal gulf rock could not
have been more dismayed for he real-
ized as did every one else in the com-
pany that there was no longer anv
reason to wait for the word of the pro-
 prietor the tenant of the apartment
was here

   and corning too went aghast it was
plain when he first recognized the iden-
tity of the prisoner his face grew
white and he had to take a quick step
to preserve his balance for his guilty
heart failed him as he saw at once that
the time for action



his crime was known and the pursuit
begun

  then with a better comprehension of
the situation a malignant light kindled
in his eye and he raised his hand to
hide the smile of triumph which flick-
ered across his lips

   yes certainly i know this man he
replied to the questions addressed to
him  but it is equally certain that i
do not know what he was doing in my
room

  as he spoke he turned the key in the
lock and as he switched on the light
turned instinctively toward the desk
with a sharp exclamation he sprang
forward and thrust his hand into the
rifled compartment

   good heavens  he cried  i
have been robbed of ten thousand dol-
lars in bonds

  the policeman stepped quickly back
to rock and reaching into his inside
coat-pocket held up the envelope

    is these thimt he asked

   then come wid me my gay joker
clapping down a hand of authority on
his prisoners shoulder  th captn be
wantin to see yez down at th station-
house  

chapter x

held for evidence

   harry realized the futility of attempt-
ing any defense at that stage of the pro-
ceedings and therefore accompanied his
captor quietly and with the best grace he
could muster over to the police station

  arrived there however he imme-
diately asked for an interview with the
captain and made a clean breast of the
whole affair at least so far as the bonds
were concerned his own trouble on
account of the draft he somewhat dole-
fully reflected would become known soon
enough

  the captain was naturally a bit in-
credulous of the story recited to him
but being favorably impressed with the
seeming frankness of the young prisoner
finally consented that george ramsey
should be telephoned to come down

  the distressing information came
back however that mr ramsey was
quite-ill with a severe sick headache and

could not be disturbed on any account
would not his presence on the morrow
serve as well 

    every bit as well as far as i am
concerned commented the captain
 but its a shade rough on you if youre
innocent mr rock for under the cir-
cumstances i shall of course have to lock
you up

   oh thats all right rejoined
harry thinking involuntarily that with-
in a very short time the experience might
become a by no means novel one to him
 the chief point of interest with me is
to know that the bonds are safe and
you will take good care of them

    oh yes they will be as secure here
as they would in your vault over at the
thirty-fourth national

   corning who had been sitting across
the room pretending to be serenely con-
temptuous of rocks charges against him
jumped up as though he were shot

    secure here  he gasped  do you
mean to tell me that i cannot have my
property now that the thief is under
arrest 

   certainly not those bonds will
have to be held as evidence until the case
is finally adjudicated

    oh but i say in agitated protest
 that will never do why i need those
bonds to put through an important busi-
ness deal to-morrow absolutely must
have them

   cant help that mr corning
youve had this man arrested on the
evidence of those bonds being in his
possession and now they will have to
remain with us until the court decides to
whom they do belong

   but i will withdraw the charge
cried corning eagerly  i will decline
to prosecute

   all his debonair assumption was gone
now his face was gray and his hands
trembled as he knotted his fingers to-
 gether if he could not secure the bonds
and market them he saw where a swift
retribution waited for him

    yes i withdraw the charge he re-
peated almost hysterically

    then said the captain a glint of a
teasing twinkle in his eye  you admit
that the bonds belong to mr rock eh
their having been in his possession being
prima facie proof of his ownership


the argosy

  belong to him howled the dis-
tracted wretch no no no they
are mine  will withdraw the charge

 tell you but only on condition that
the bonds are returned to me at once

   and rather than consent to that
broke in rock   would spend every
night in a cell for the next ten years 
the police captain who had been
studying the faces and actions of both
young men and considering within him-
self suddenly reached a decision to send
for george ramsey again but this time
more peremptorily and upon his own
hook

   there is more in this case than ap-
pears on the surface he muttered into
the depths of his heavy mustache  and
i guess its about up to me to learn what
has been going on 

  he made no mention of his purpose to
either of the young men however but
having secretly despatched the message
watched with amusement the game which
was on between them

  corning ghastly now between appre-
hension and anxiety was trying by every
means in his power to induce rock to
give up the bonds and let the charge
of burglary be dropped but harry was
sturdily resisting all his persuasions

  at last after a manifest inward strug-
gle the sharper came to a desperate
resolution pretending to want a drink
of water he crossed the floor and as he
passed the others chair he muttered in a
rapid undertone

   that draft you cashed for spear is
bogus and will cost you your job if
you let me keep four of the bonds you
can have the other six and so be able
to square the thing up is it a bar-
gain 

  like a flash rock was upon his feet
and all the nervous strain the pent-up
passion and the restrained feeling of that
eventful day went into the blow which
lie sent smashing squarely into comings
face

  take that you thieving hound you
crawling treacherous beast for an an-
swer to your dirty bribe 

  the recipient of the blow went to the
floor dazed and with his cherished
beauty pretty effectually spoiled for the
time being but as the police captain
sprang forward to interfere harry

turned on his heel and resumed his seat
as though too utterly contemptuous of
such vermin to pay any further attention
to him

  at that moment there came a rap on
the door and the captain interrupted the
rather caustic homily he was energetic-
ally delivering to both combatants in
order to open it

   that must he george ramsey he
muttered to himself but it wasnt

   it was to his surprise a very stylishly
and becomingly attired young woman
who her face suddenly suffused with
color rushed up to harry rock and took
both his hands in hers

  then she turned to the captain

   i am anita ramsey she explained
 and when your message came stating
that mr rock was in some sort of
trouble down here my brother was
asleep and as my father is in philadel-
phia there was no one to come but
myself if i can be of use in any way
pray command me for any member of
our family would esteem it only too great
a privilege to be of assistance to mr
rock

   im afraid you cant be of any help
though maam replied the captain dis-
appointedly  what i wanted to ask
your brother about you see oblivious to
the signals harry was making to him
 was in regard to some bonds which mr
rock insists belong to your brother but
which this mr corning also claims as
his

  bonds she repeated with a puz-
zled air  i didnt know that george
had any bonds

   these are ten railroad bonds of the
value of one thousand dollars each
went on the captain with the hope of
refreshing her memory  see here they
are perhaps you may remember your
brothers having had them

  he lifted the envelope from his desk
and held it up for her inspection

   why-why- she gasped  those
bonds are mine my very own that
father gave me for a present when-

  but the police captains attention was
caught by a figure which rising from
the floor had started to steal furtively
through the door

   hey he called to his subordinates
in the other room  dont let that man get
the time for action



away hold him some of you out
there it is beginning to look as though
i shall want him

chapter xi

oh what a difference l the
morning

  there was of course nothing else for
rock but to give anita the straight story
of the bonds from beginning to end and
although he spared george all that he
possibly could in his recital it did not
take her long to perceive that her brother
had been saved solely through his
friends courage and readiness of re-
source

   oh harry she cried  it seems to
me as though you were ahvays coming to
the rescue of some member of our family
i wonder if there was ever before any one
so dependable and absolutely square as
you

  he felt like a whipped cur for all the
time she was praising him the thought
of that chicago draft kept rising to his
mind to spoil his pleasure in her com-
mendation

  neither did he tell her of the scrape
he was in for he knew that she would
immediately offer to help him out from
her own resources and he did not think
he could quite bear that

  as to going his bail at the police sta-
tion that was a mere formality and he
interposed no objection when she insist-
ed on doing it but when it came to ac-
cepting a substantial obligation at her
hands to rid him of a load resulting from
his own follies-why he told himself he
would rather starve and die in the gutter

  yet it was a sore temptation to confide
in her if only for the happiness of having
a secret between them and to receive her
sympathy and pardon he longed to lay
bis poor bruised heart at her feet and
then if she granted him absolution he
did not care what might happen to him

  but he dared not speak and have her
offer monetary aid to him only to despise
him ever after

  so as he took her home she noticed
that he was not the frank open comrade
he had always been to her and she won-
dered grievingly what could have changed
him

  he made her promise though before
he left that she would not speak of
georges shortcomings to her father upon
the latters return and as she agreed to
this a passionate tremble crept into his
voice which made her glance down quick-
ly and wonder if his previous restraint
had been only shyness and if he was
about to speak the words her heart con-
fessed she was ready to hear

  but he said no more merely pressed
her hand and without a word went quick-
ly away leaving her still wondering

  she did not understand the reason of
the tremble in his voice nor why he had
exacted the promise the latter was be-
cause he had made up his mind to confess
all the circumstances of his own scrape
to old daniel g upon the morrow and
he did not wish to appear in the light of
trading for mercy upon the favor he had
been able to render the son

  the tremble in his voice was due to a
sudden realization that after his story
was told he would have to resign definite-
ly and forever the dream he had held so
long old daniel g might permit him
to retain his position in the bank but
receive him as a husband for his daugh-
ter-never

  still he held manfully to his resolu-
tion  for he knew it was the only square
and honest thing to do but oh-as he
said to himself that night while he tossed
upon a sleepless couch trying to conjure
up some way of avoiding the unpleasant
necessity-but oh he would rather have
every tooth in his head pulled out slowly
one by one daniel gs scorn was not
a pleasant thing to face

  yet rack his brain as he would-and
he had done little but this ever since the
problem had risen to confront him-no
other suggestion seemed to offer itself
he must tell the stupid silly story over
to that stern grizzled old man and take
the consequences whatever they might be

  slowly and haltingly he wended his
way to the bank like a boy on the way
to school expectant of a whipping he
showed small zest for the preliminary
duties of the day but kept casting fre-
quent glances toward the door of the
little office marked  president as
though equally apprehensive that its
occupants might or might not appear
one other thing he did too he hunted


the argosy

up the mail-clerk and destroyed the
scurrilous anonymous letter which corn-
ing had posted the night before the
truth was bad enough without having a
lot of lies tacked to it

  and that truth-bad enough as it was
-he had to tell to daniel g ramsey
how the cloud of that coming confession
hung over him it seemed to change the
morning which was clear and beautiful
outside into a murky lowering day with
overcast skies and damp chilling winds

  the hour of his ordeal was postponed
however for the president happened to
be late and with the opening of the bank
to the public rock had to enter his cage
to stay there until relieved

  somewhat fretful of the delay harry
regarded it as almost a personal affront
on the part of fate that the first cus-
tomer to appear should be the pool-room
man whose place he had visited the day
before

  as though to mock him too the fellow
pulled out a roll of bills large enough
to choke a horse and began peeling off
five hundreds and thousands as though
he never would stop

  finally he wadded the money up into
a bunch and pushed it through the win-
dow

   there you are he said

  harry supposed he had simply made a
mistake and nodded his head in the di-
rection of the receiving-teller

   wrong window he admonished
shortly

   no no persisted the man  thats
yours

   mine  staring blankly

   certainly what you won on gold
heels yesterday five thousand dollars
at official odds of six to one or thirty
thousand as your profit count it and
see if there isnt thirty-five thousand in
the bundle

  harry wondered if he was dreaming
or the man insane

   but gold heels didnt win he
faltered  he led all the way to the
finish but was beaten out by a little sorrel
who came from behind

   oh that was gold hills said the
man impatiently

  then he stopped abruptly and now it
was his turn to stare

   do you mean to tell me that you

intended to bet on gold hills he asked
in awestruck tones  and got your money
down on gold heels instead man
man dazedly shaking his head  you
ought to quit this job and go into a
museum as the greatest specimen of luck
unhung

   still i oughtnt to kick he added
cheerfully  for i followed your lead
and drew in a nice little wad myself im
just on my way to the next window now
to give it to you chaps to take care of
well so long come over and see me
soon again

  harry threw up his hands

   not on your life  he rejoined gaily

 lightning never strikes but once in the
same place and ive been hit

  then without delay he wired six thou- 
sand dollars to chicago to meet the bogus
draft when it should arrive and deposit-
ed the balance to the credit of his almost
moribund bank account

  strange how all the world now took on
a different aspect the sky was blue and
the sun shining and even the grumpy old
bookkeeper whom he disliked appeared
to him as a long-lost brother

  yet one thing remained unaltered he
felt that he must still tell daniel g-
not only because the bank had a right
to know of the transaction concerning the
draft but also for his own sake in order
that the memory of the dressing-down he
was going to receive might serve as a
deterrent to any such escapades in the
future

  and tell he did falteringly shame-
facedly but holding nothing back and
concealing not one thing

  daniel g listened to the end in si- 
lence then he observed dryly

   and so you borrowed six thousand
dollars of the banks money and by your
good judgment made thirty thousand dol-
lars in one afternoon that looks like
good business to me lets go into it to-
gether

   not for me and harry spoke em-
phatically  i wouldnt go through
what i have suffered in the past twenty-
four hours again for thirty thousand
times thirty thousand dollars and as
for good judgment i have already told
you that my winning was a sheer fluke
the bull-headedest sort of bull-headed
luck no sir i have made up my
that stick and singleton



mind i will never lay a wager on an-
other horse-race so far as i am con-
cerned hereafter the horse will  run for
sweeny as they say at the track

  the severe hut kindly old banker gave
one of his rare smiles

   right my boy he said  and i be-
lieve you youhave had a hard lesson
but i think you will be an all the better
man on account of it you have told
me very little concerning your squander-
ing of money and your idle habits which
i did not already know for i have kept
closer tab on you than you have perhaps
thought

   but i have always trusted that you
would see whither you were heading some
day and would then pull up short and
i believe that time has now come to you
harry

    you have shown it by coming to me
for this interview this morning you
showed it by the noble way in which you
stood by george in that affair of his-

   george 

   yes smiling a little sadly  you
have not been the only one to make con-
fession to me this morning the boy had
been weak even criminal but i am glad
to say he behaved like a man in the end
and told me everything of his own ac-
cord you will know some day how

deeply i appreciate the share you took in
the transaction

   i only wish i could have done more
said harry modestly  i am afraid as it
turned out there can be no escape from
some notoriety

   oh yes therecan returned the old
man  that has already been arranged
and corning and spear will be prose-
cuted not for the affair of the bonds but
for some very shady business deals in
which they have been engaged and of
which i was already cognizant i am
told that both of them are almost certain
to receive long terms in sing sing

  he paused and rock taking this as a
signal for him to go started toward the
door but the old man called him back

   am i mistaken harry he asked a
bit constrainedly  that you have always
cared a good deal more for anita than
you showed upon the surface 

  harry taken utterly by surprise raised
a pair of quick startled eyes to meet the
old mans gaze bent searchingly upon
him

  their glances interchanged and al-
though not a word was spoken both un-
derstood what was in the others mind

   she is free harry said daniel g
softly at last  why dont you go in and
win

that stick and singleton

     

                 by joseph ivers lawrence

            an early morning sally after thieves and the singular fashion in
            which the belated member of the posse gave an account of himself

one after another the brightly
lighted windows of the big thor-
ley house winked out until it was only
a huge black shadow in the moonlight

  a house party of some magnitude was
in progress and there had been dancing
in the evening but the guests tired after
a day of golf tennis and rowing had
retired early and by one oclock not
even a servant was about and perfect
quiet reigned the moon cast a pale
blue light over the lawn throwing the
cordons of rare evergreens and exotic
shrubs into all sorts of fantastic figures 

but not a sound was to be heard not
even when three creeping figures parted
the branches of a clump of conifers and
hastened stealthily across the grass a
wakeful sparrow chirped protestingly at
having his rest broken but the three in-
truders made no sound

  they crept into the dark shadows of
the veranda and immediately concen-
trated their attention upon a window-
leading into the hall that they could
not have been adepts may be gathered
from the fact that after they had labored
over the work of the glazier and lock-


the argosy

smith for some moments a sleep-destroy-
ing burglar-alarm went off like the
tocsin of an army and in another in-
stant the whole house was lighted as for
a festival

   the three novices were good runners
and made off across the grounds without
minding garden-paths or new flower-
beds and it is probable that no harm
might have been done beyond breaking
the rest of a sparrow and ruining a good
pane of glass had not a young groom
returning home from a night off in the
town heard the alarm-bell in the house
of his master and thrown himself cour-
ageously in the path of the fugitives

  he was a brawny lad  well able to
give an account of himself and he gave
the tallest of the three a sharp tussle for
a moment but one of the ruffians com-
rades came to his rescue and quickly
rendered the poor groom hors de combat
by hammering his head vigorously with
a heavy jimmy

  when mr thorley ran out with a
number of his male guests the inter-
lopers were far away and the groom lay
there his face turned up to the moon
with a fractured skull a motor - car
was quickly brought from the garagt
and he was hurried to the hospital in the
town but he died without regaining
consciousness

  there was little sleep in the house
after that some of the women were
hysterical and required medical attend-
ance and the men sat up and smoked
and talked of various methods of run-
ning the bandits to earth

   the alarm was telegraphed to all the
neighboring towns and it was decided
that as soon as day dawned the men
would start out under the leadejship of
a deputy sheriff and scour the country-
side it seemed very probable that the
ruffians would hide near by until oppor-
tunity offered an easy escape out of the
region

   as the gray light came in at the win-
dows the men proceeded to arm them-
selves with care the gun-room was de-
pleted of shotguns and thorley scraped
up a revolver or two

   where is singleton he inquired

   gone back to bed sniffed brooks
with contempt

    but i am sure he intends to go with

you protested ethel thorley in defense
of the absent

   call mr singleton said the host
sourly to a servant

  presently the man returned and re-
ported that mr singleton was dressing
and would join the party in a half-hour

   he seems indifferent to work of this
sort remarked brooks with a side
glance at miss thorley

   never mind said her father  we
will start without him and he can join
us at his pleasure

  when singleton came down - stairs
miss thorley greeted him rather coldly

   they have started slie told him
 and father said you might follow if
you cared to

    oh well now isnt that too bad  
said singleton calmly  i didnt know
there was such a rush and theyve
taken all the artillery with them ill
wager

   must you be armed cap-a-pie to
hunt for a few footpads asked the
girl with some acidity

  why no laughed singleton  i
wonder that they cared to go out like a
squad of musketeers i shall be satis-
fied with one of those stout sticks in the
hall-rack my own is rather light for a
combat

  lie lighted a cigarette and chose the
heaviest stick in his hosts collection
then he sauntered forth to trail the
posse

  the neighborhood was thoroughly
aroused by the cruel death of the groom
and most of the men were assisting in
the search so singleton had some dif-
ficulty in getting information as to the
direction the party had taken but soon
he got a general idea of their proposed
route and calculated that he might by
fast walking come up with them in half
an hour

   over the hills he strode paying little
heed to the quest of the robbers as the
posse had already covered the ground
as he gained a high eminence he saw
on the next hilltop outlined against the
sky several figures they seemed to
pause for a while and then took up the
march and came toward him evidently
retracing their steps

  he at once started down the hilly
road to meet them in the valley
that stick and singleton



  a few clouds had gathered the sun
was obscured and soon a few large
drops fell then a few more in quicker
cadence and a roaring summer shower
broke over the valley there was no
hope of avoiding a soaking but single-
ton turned up his collar and raced for
the nearest shelter which happened to
be a deserted shanty that had once done
duty as a farmhouse

  as he neared it he saw that the
cracked and shrunken door was closed
but he was thinking solely of escaping
as much of the rain as possible and he
went at the door like a battering-ram
it was apparently fastened with a rusty
old bolt but the wood gave way and he
landed inside

  it was quite dimly lighted by two
small windows shaded by the wild
growth of lilacs outside and he did not
see clearly for an instant then he looked
about him and discovered that he was the
center of a group of three

  they had none of the air of peaceable
rustics-ready to welcome him to shelter
one black-visaged fellow stood glower-
ing at him and training a vicious-looking
derringer menacingly the other two
were prepared to make flank attacks at
any moment with a long knife and a
black-jack respectively

   i fear i intrude remarked sin-
gleton

   well thats about the size of it
said the man with the gun  but youd
better stay right where you are and
dont move your hands round too much
im pretty nervous and i might let the
gun go off accidental

  singleton leaned against the table in
the middle of the room and tried to pre-
serve some nonchalance fingering his
walking-stick idly but prepared to grip
it firmly and defend himself at any mo-
ment

  what we goin to do with im
asked the man with the knife

  the man with the gun deliberated for
a moment

   gag him and tie him up in thg
garret i guess he suggested

   pah  said the fellow with the
black-jack theyd find im within
twenty-four hours and hed give the
police a full description of our mugs and
our clothes and everything

   well you tell us what to do with
him then said the first speaker  maybe
youd like to take him along with us for
a pet

  the desperado thought deeply glan-
cing over the athletic form of singleton
then he looked at the walking-stick the
knife and the revolver each in turn

   kill im  he growled gutturally
 weve done one already might just as
well do two

  the other two flinched slightly but
singleton held himself together

   sir you are a man of action there
is nothing like thoroughness he ob-
served coolly

   pretty fresh at that said the man
of the gun  youd better shut up

  at that moment voices were heard
echoing faintly from the valley sin-
gleton and the robbers started nervously
and listened the posse must be within
five hundred yards of the shanty and
the men would be-sure to notice that the
door had been forced in since they had
inspected it in the morning

   you let out one peep and youre a
dead one said the man with the gun
brandishing it slightly

  my god yere not goin to stay
here like this and wait to see if theyre
cornin to call are yer demanded an-
other fellow

  no said the first wed better
gag this lad now and take im up in the
garret and keep quiet

  the man with the knife set about
searching for a rope and a suitable gag
while the other two eyed singleton as
though dreading to lay hands on him
his stick was stout and his eye deter-
mined but he leaned calmly against the
table apparently indifferent to what
they were saying or planning

  the voices now sounded much nearer
and singleton knew that he could make
his friends hear if he shouted loudly
but the derringer in the hand of the
stupid brute before him had to be reck-
oned with as well as the long knife and
the bludgeon

  he still toyed with the stick idly to
conceal his agitation and he wondered
how far he might depend on his old
training as a fencer to defend him with
a cane against three more dangerous
weapons if luck were on his side the
	the

stick was heavy enough to break the wrist
of the derringer-man in one quick blow
and then the other two might be settled
with as many thrusts in the neck if the
direction of his lunge was still reliable

  the odds were unquestionably three
to one but he was a good sportsman
and they didnt seem so heavy as ones
mind turns on the most trivial things at
the gravest moments he thought for a
passing instant how finely polished and
satiny the stick was as it slipped through
his fingers and in the next he started
with ill-concealed excitement

   his forefinger had suddenly encoun-
tered a peculiar excrescence on the
smooth surface of the malacca it could
mean but one thing a beautifully fin-
ished stick like that would hardly have
chance flaws and knots in its surface
his face flushed with pleasure and relief
as the little knot yielded to the pressure
of his finger the plain inoffensive walk-
ing-stick was the envelope of one of those
little aristocrats of the great family of
cold steel a damascus dueling-blade-
triangular elastic tough-with a point
as sharp as a cambric needle

   he would have but to press the small
button whip the slender blade from its
disguising case and he would be as well
armed as any good fencer cares to be
but the gun might go off first and he
decided that his first move was to strike
the weapon from the mans hand then
he could jump back against the door and
defend himself against all comers with
the naked blade

  the posse was evidently within two
hundred yards of the house but moving
slowly and the man with the gun
looked around uneasily as the searcher
returned with an old cord a rag and a
bit of wood he looked at singleton
almost kindly

    now you be sensible and do as we
tell yer and youll get along all right
he said

   very well replied singleton
 what shall i do first

    drop that club and turn yer back
ordered the man and as the approach-
ing voices sounded suddenly nearer he
added  and be blame quick about it 

    yes  shouted singleton  lets be
quick

  and with the speed of lightning he

argosy	

 brought down the stick upon the wrist
 of the man before him knocking the
 derringer to the floor and exploding it
 at the same time he shouted wildly for
 help

   as he jumped backward the man with
the knife rushed at him and thrust wild-
ly before he could draw his new-found
weapon but with an upward motion
singleton buried the ferrule of the stick
in the softest part of the mans neck
the fellow went over backward and lay
upon the floor without moving

  at that moment the man with the
maimed wrist and his remaining pal fled
up the stairs to the garret like fright-
ened rabbits as the door was thrown
open and the room swarmed with ex-
cited men

   the two men in the garret were soon
routed out and handcuffed and a farm-
wagon was procured to take them to the
county jail and their apparently life-
less comrade to the hospital then the
thorley party made its way home by
the shortest route and thorley proceed-
ed to celebrate the heroism of singleton
in a truly pickwickian fashion

   wine was fetched from the cellar and
 a repast was laid and every one had to
 shake the hero by the hand several times
 and assure him that no one else would
 have had the courage to contend with
 three ruffians single-handed in a half-
 lighted room brooks was a little stiff
 remembering his slurs of the morning
 bu he assured singleton that it was
 really a fine thing to do

   you did just what i expected you
would do if you had the opportunity
whispered ethel thorley blushing and
pressing his hand more than cordially

   oh now let me have a word 
laughed singleton  i dont want all
the glory of this affair without explain-
ing some of the inside of it you see
i thought i had an ordinary walking-
stick when i tumbled into the shanty
with those fellows and i believed i had
a rather slim chance in a scrimmage with
them but my household gods were with
me and i suddenly discovered a little
button on the stick which told me that
i was armed with a good sword-cane
that gave me a great burst of courage
and without further consideration i
plunged into the mess and they dis-
at his mercy



persed before i had even time to draw
my trusty blade

  at this moment while the audience
was listening to the narrative with bated
breath inarticulate apoplectic sounds
drew all eyes to mr thorley who was
seen to be purple in the face from sup-
pressed laughter

 my word oh lord -oh save
me  he howled rocking backward and
forward and holding his sides

  what is the matter shouted every
one at the same time

   are you ill father  cried ethel
no-no he gasped partially re-
covering   but singleton  oh single-
ton you will be the death of me didnt
you draw that keen blade from its scab-
bard at all you rogue  

   why no answered singleton  i
found that the danger was over before
it had well begun and i really never
thought to look at the blade afterward

  thorley had a slight relapse but
managed to gasp to the butler who was
in attendance

   go fetch me that heavy stick from
the hall-stand

  the butler brought in the now-famous
malacca cane and all eyes were turned
upon it with reverence but thorley
seized it and still shaking with laughter
pressed the button with his fat thumb
took off the upper part of the stick and
disclosed to the view of the astonished
audience in the lower section the mouth
of a glass tube from which he decanted
into his wine-glass a fluid which resem-
bled good brandy

  as singleton and the rest began to
recover their wits and grasp the situa-
tion thorley raised his glass and said
 i propose a toast to the hero who
armed with his trusty brandy - flask
fought and captured three desperadoes
single-handed

at his mercy

the invisible wall

at ten minutes after the hour of
noon on a bright day in april
the south coast limited was speeding
toward the city of merton at a rate of
sixty miles an hour

  jerry calkins the veteran engineer
grasped the throttle firmly and his eyes
watched closely the twin lines of steel
ahead the train was due at merton
in three minutes and was seven miles
from the union station calkins was
a man who detested being behind time

  suddenly the locomotive whistle
shrieked

   well were at the junction tower
commented bis fireman  well not be
more than five minutes late at that
and after all the bad luck weve had-

   shut up you fool  calkins cried
above the roar of the train  five min-

utes amounts to something when were
driving the crack train of the road do
you take this for an annulled freight
well get called by the old man as much
as though that five minutes was five
hours this is the last time im going
to try- what the deuce 

  the fireman gave a cry of alarm
jerry calkins answered it with a cry of
wonder then he swung on the throttle
quickly and stood on the floor of the
cab shaking like a nervous wreck great
drops of perspiration standing out on
his face and arms

  what-what was it the fireman
gasped

  por the limited running at a mile a
minute had suddenly stopped as though
it had crashed against a stone wall

  i-i thought wed jumped the
track jerry gasped  w-what-

   were still on the track  the fire-
man cried  what did it


the argosy

  there came a chorus of cries from the
coaches and sleepers behind passengers
poured from the cars and ran alongside
the train toward the locomotive

  they had been thrown violently from
their seats many of them had received
serious cuts and bruises they ex-
pected to find the results of a head-on
collision to see mangled bodies of en-
ginemen to gaze upon twisted steel
where monster locomotives had been be-
fore

  instead they found the locomotive
tender baggage and mail cars standing
on the track uninjured looking just the
same as though the train had been under
the great train-shed at merton

   what is it jerry  the conductor
cried pushing his way through the
crowd

   we-we stopped the engineer mut-
tered

   i should think you did and you
piled up every one behind you but
why did you stop her

   i-i didnt stop her  the engineer
answered  she stopped while the
throttle was wide open just as i was
throwing her open wider after passing
the junction tower i dont know-

   i thought youd pulled up to pre-
vent a collision the conductor went
on  something the matter with the
locomotive perhaps look her over
ill get these people away so you can
work 

  the conductor turned to the passen-
gers

   all aboard  he cried  all
aboard 

  but why did he stop chorused a
hundred voices

  the conductor was something of a
diplomat and had the honor of the road
at heart he smiled down at them from
his position on the steps of the loco-
motive

  just thank your stars that you were
riding behind an engineer who had sense
enough to stop the minute he knew
something was wrong instead of taking
a chance and wrecking you while you
were so near home-and dont ask ques-
tions now he said

  muttering among themselves at the
unsatisfactory reply the passengers
made their way back to the cars jerry

and the fireman sprang to the ground
immediately and looked over the loco-
motive

   shes as good as the day she came
from the shops jerry reported
 theres nothing wrong with her 

   maybe she just had a spasm the
fireman suggested  locomotives do
funny things sometimes

  youre right there said jerry
 well well try it again

  they got back in the cab and jerry
backed the long train

   she seems to be all right now he
remarked  confound it this will
put us back another five minutes

  the train came to a stop and then
began to move forward

  shes all right jerry cried
well wouldnt this thing jar you

   funny commented the fireman

  the locomotive arrived at the place
where it had stepped so peculiarly be-
fore and it stopped again

  jerry shut off steam then opened the
throttle slowly then threw it open
quickly and tried every trick of his pro-
fession but the locomotive seemed
glued to that one spot

  he could move the train backward he
could move it forward to a certain point
-then it stopped and the great dri-
ving-wheels spun around on the rails
just the same whether the track was
sanded or not but the giant locomotive
wouldnt move forward an inch

  jerry shut off steam again his face
was white and he was shaking

  what on earth is it the fireman
cried

  the conductor had made his way for-
ward a second time and sprang into the
cab to ask questions jerry explained
all that he knew the conductor
laughed

  jerry illustrated by backing the train
and approaching slowly there was no
doubting for the conductor then the
engine was under perfect control any-
where except at that particular place on
the track the train would back as far
as the engineer desired it and approach
at any speed until it reached that spot-
then it would stop suddenly

   just like running up against a stone
wall said the fireman

   but you can see a stone wall re-
at iis

mercy



plied the conductor  and you cant
see anything here 

  they made a quick examination of
the track everything seemed to be all
right the mystery was beyond explain
ing

  if theres anything the matter with
that locomotive its something ive never
run across before and ive railroaded
some jerry said

   but there isnt any other explana-
tion the conductor retorted

   well it is no use to try to run in
town again jerry went on  its time
for the outgoing limited to be coming
along too well have to take a
siding 

   ill send a brakeman back to the
junction tower to wire in the conduct-
or said  the limited wont come out
while were on this block

  the brakeman was sent back with the
report-a report which stated that at
a certain place in the track jerrys loco-
motive had stopped like a balky horse
and refused to budge an inch that it
seemed everything was all right as long
as no attempt was made to pass that one
spot it was suggested that the out-
going limited run slowly until it had
passed the side-tracked ingoing train
and the junction tower

  the superintendent swore when he
got that message then he ran down and
got on the outgoing limited and ordered
it to proceed when the train rounded
the curve out of the yards those on its
locomotive could see jerrys train side-
tracked and waiting the track seemed
all right

   something wrong with jerrys en-
gine thats all muttered the superin-
tendent  i thought hed been in the
business long enough to know an en-
gine  

  those on jerrys locomotive watched
closely as the other train approached
it was running slowly the engineer ap-
parently using great caution it ap-
proached the spot beyond which jerrys
train had refused to go-now it was
upon it now it had passed and the last
car was rattling over it as the foremost
cars came abreast of jerrys locomotive
the superintendent sprang oif and the
outgoing train its locomotive giving a
whistle that seemed to be one of derision

   	a

to jerry dashed away on its long jour-
ney

  well wouldnt that jar you
jerry exclaimed

   whats the matter here  the super-
intendent cried  dont you know how
to run an engine do you know youve
got a few hundred passengers behind
you that are swearing at this road and
every one connected with it whats
the trouble	i

   i-i dont know sir jerry replied

  he explained at length to the su-
perintendent and the superintendent
laughed as the conductor had done
jerry therefore demonstrated

  he backed the train and handled it
with his usual skill then he ran it
forward but when it reached that point
in the track the locomotive jarred and
stopped

  jumping jerusalem exploded the
superintendent  but we cant stop to
explain it now send some one back
to the tower and order out another en-
gine uncouple jerry and leave the
train on the main track then take that
antiquated pile of junk youre running
and put it on the side track 

  in time the other locomotive arrived
from the yards it passed the myste-
rious stretch of track safely it coupled
on to the limited and started to pull
the train gathered speed and ap-
proached that mysterious spot jerry
and his fireman and the superintendent
stood beside the track watching

  and when the train reached the spot
it stopped again

   what the- the official began

  he ran forward with jerry and the
fireman at his heels

  the other engineer was swearing and
trying everything of which he could
think to carry his train beyond that
spot

   guess my engines gone back on me
sir he said as the superintendent came
running up

  the passengers were piling out of the
cars again some of them business men
who looked at their watches and mut-
tered things about the road others were
travelers who were missing connections
they crowded around the superintend-
ent and demanded an explanation the
official was in agony


the argosy

   theres only one thing to do he
cried  we dont know whats the mat-
ter but it is evidently something in the
track we cant make a locomotive go
past this spot youll have to walk down
the track half a mile to the nearest
street-car well get your baggage to
the station as quickly as possible if
you are sustaining losses youll have to
sue the road i guess i cant help it
and these men of mine cant we cant
take a train past that spot and thats all
there is to it 

  there was a chorus of objections but
they soon ceased and the passengers re-
turned to the coaches for their hand-
baggage there was nothing to do ex-
cept to adopt the superintendents plan

  they started down the track two
traveling men leading the crowd as
they came to the mysterious spot a few
yards awray which the superintendent
had pointed out as the one beyond which
the train could not go their interest in-
creased and they inspected the track

   looks like an ordinary track to me
and that outgoing train didnt seem to
have any trouble here one of the trav-
eling men remarked  that superin-
tendents lying for some reason hope
a hundred sue the road-and get what
they sue for rotten management 
the other was walking some distance
in front of him suddenly he stopped
backed up started forward and stopped
again then he dropped his grip on the
ground and went through the pantomime
of pushing against something with all
his strength

  to the man behind it looked as
though he was pushing against the air

   are you crazy too pal   he cried
loudly

  the other looked around his face
was white horror written in every line
of it

   try to walk past here  he ex-
claimed

  past where i dont see anything
 neither do i but try to walk down
the track

think i cant just watch me
but he didnt proceed far he
stopped as the other had done and
looked around with a puzzled expression
on his face

  then the rest of the crowd caught up

with them and tried to walk down the
track and could not do it

  at first they were amazed and then
after repeated futile attempts to move
forward their amazement gave place to
terror what was wrong apparently
here wras nothing but a stretch of ordi-
nary railroad track and ordinary at-
mosphere but at a certain point it seemed
they ran against an invisible wall and
could go no farther

  it doesnt take terror long to fasten
itself upon people when it is founded
on something seemingly supernatural
in ten minutes the passengers of the
limited constituted a frenzied mob
they ran to either side of the track a
hundred yards-two-three hundred-
and tried to walk toward the city there
but always it wras the same

  a tramp walking out from the city
observed the crowd and wondered what
the trouble was they stopped their
crazed actions to watch him he cami-
on-and passed the invisible wall

  they surrounded him tried to explain
finally persuaded him to try to walk
back he did more than try to walk
back he tried to run back with fear
in his heart for he thought a crowd of
lunatics was at his heels

  and when he reached that invisible
wall he came to a quick stop

  at this juncture one of the travel-
ing men noticed a team being driven
along a near-by road-from the city to
the country it passed out safely an-
other team w-as going toward the city
it stopped

  the driver lashed his horses but they
could not move forward the driver
himself started to run ahead to pick up
a club that lay in the road-but he
couldnt get to the club

  a dog trotted down the track toward
the city when he reached the invisible
wall he stopped acted peculiarly then
turned tail and fled howling with all
the power of his lungs

  what does it mean what does it
mean the people wrere crying

  but nobody knew

  human beings domestic animals
trains-things animate and inanimate
no matter what their motive power-
could pass coming from the city to the
outside
at his mercy



  but nothing could pass froth the out-
side into the city

chapter ii

the only men in town

  there was a press telegrapher on
jerry calkinss train he offered his
services and was taken back to the junc-
tion tower where the regular operator
was deposed and the more expert man sat
down before the key

  he managed to get his wire connected
with telegraph headquarters in merton
then he tapped out the story

  headquarters did not believe at first
the chief thought some raving maniac
had gained possession of the tower but
soon there came messages from other
points-from east and west and north-
and they told substantially the same
story

  the invisible wall seemed to surround
the city

  the newspapers came out with extra
editions and made the news public and
the people laughed

  then the leading paper a conservative
organ announced that it had sent its best
man to the place where jerrys train was
standing and that their man after gath-
ering the facts-was not able to reenter
the city

  the news spread throughout the town
with great rapidity the electric lines
did a thriving business especially the one
which had a terminus within half a mile
of where jerrys train was stalled
crowds of people left the cars there and
hurried down the track toward the crowd
outside

  they rushed forward heard the story
from the others and started to rush back
to spread it among later arrivals and
they found they could not get back

  the people were divided into two
classes one class still laughed and
wanted to experiment the other class
thought it some trick and did not even
take the trouble to laugh

  people who journeyed to the invisible
wall could see nothing unusual except
the peculiar antics of the people outside
every person went out sure that he or
she would be able to return where the
others had failed and in this manner

several thousand people found themselves
outside when night came and unable to
return

  business men were separated from their
establishments employees who worked
at night were unable to go to their labor
husbands were separated from their
wives fathers and mothers from their
children

  there was no sleep in merton that
night ihe people crowded the business
section and discussed the affair street
preachers took advantage of it throngs
on every corner read the latest bulletins
sent by the telegraphers outside

  morning dawned upon a scene of ter-
ror thousands of messages came from
the outside telling relatives and friends
to leave the city of mystery people col-
lected their valuables drew their money
from the banks and got away as rapidly
as possible

  outgoing trains were crowded by
noon one-third of the two hundred thou-
sand inhabitants had passed out

  and every one found it impossible to
return 

  at first the outside world laughed too
but gradually it dawned upon the nation
that the story was no hoax something
unusual was happening at merton-some-
thing unlike anything that had ever hap-
pened in history

  trains carried thousands of excursion-
ists who wanted to test the invisible wall
scientists rushed to the scene

  in three days merton was surrounded
by a great camp ihe governor of the
state ordered out the militia to preserve
order the war department was ap-
pealed to and a regiment of regular
troops sent to aid the state guardsmen

  and out of the city poured the
inhabitants intent only upon quitting
the dreaded circle of mystery

  inside the invisible wall riot reigned
peace officers with fear in their hearts
were deserting their posts everything
was at a standstill every one stopped
work to leave the city

  at the end of the week the place
seemed deserted by women and children
only now and then one being seen and
by all men except a few who remained
at their posts and the criminal class
part of which ignored their fear long
enough to profit by the occurrence


the argosy

  about the end of the first week there-
fore the city of merton but a few days
before so beautiful and prosperous was
an inferno a few hundred coarse char-
acters roamed the streets looting resi-
dences and business houses

  their senses numbed by liquor they
committed every crime of which they
could think one by one they made their
way from town carrying with them their
ill-gotten gains

  and after a few days of this after
the first excitement of crime wore away
these low criminals began to fear and
one day following a night during which
there had been a thunder-storm unusual-
ly violent they seemed to rush from the
city in a drove maddened by a fear that
had come upon them mysteriously in a
moment

  it was that same day that the day-
telegraphers at headquarters deserted the
wire absolutely refusing to remain at
their posts a moment longer and the
wires went dead

  the thousands outside could get no
word in the junction tower and in
the other near-by telegraph stations out-
side operators in vain called headquar-
ters there was no answer

  jerry calkins was at the junction
tower where he spent a great part of his
time when not pulling the special trains
that ran from the invisible wall to the
next division - point on the road he
heard people saying that all of the teleg-
raphers had deserted

  not all he cried you can bet
my son hasnt

  your son said the mayor of mer-
ton who happened to be present

   yes sir hes on the night-shift
bob calkins-thats his name hes been
trained right-and you can bet he hasnt
deserted his post

   but the wire is dead complained an
operator

  didnt i say bob worked nights
demanded jerry you avait until its
time for him to go to work and hell be
there ready to do his duty

   let us hope so said the mayor but
the way he said it indicated that he had
no hope himself personally the mayor
didnt blame any one for deserting the
city he had deserted himself

  bob calkins roomed with another

night-telegrapher fred haverson that
morning they had gone to their boarding-
house as usual and turned in after a
strenuous nights work

  they had the entire house to them-
selves and they slept in a bed that had
not been made up and were forced to go
to that bed without a meal except such
a one as they evolved from canned goods
taken from a little grocery

  the two men awoke about four in the
afternoon

   well bob haverson asked  what
are we going to do 

   go to work bob calkins answered

   are we going to stick 

   we are  

   all right-youre the boss

   you didnt want to throw up your
job did you  bob demanded

   n-no-not exactly only its get-
ting spooky working in an infernal city
like this great sctt how those chaps
were tearing the town to pieces yester-
day  

 dirty ghouls commented bob
calkins  were decent anyway and
we havent lost our nerve yet and weve
been honest thank god in spite of all
the temptation weve had we havent
taken a thing that didnt belong to us
except something to eat from the gro-
ceries and the bakeries - and  guess
theyd ought to allow us that

   speaking of eating- began fred

   well eat now laughed bob
come along got your revolver
thats good were liable to need it

  they left the house and walked rap-
idly toward the central part of the town

  they saw not a single person doors
stood open here and there a dog or horse
wandered up the street there was not
the usual jangling of street - cars the
rumbling of trucks the chng-cjiug of
motors the sound of hurrying footsteps
the great silence was oppressive

   tis rather spooky bob muttered

   guess every ones gone said fred

  nonsense theyre merely so scat-
tered that we dont happen to run into
anybody bob replied

  they entered a grocery the doors of
which stood wide open and began de-
bating on what sort of food they would
eat

  the store had been ransacked for val-
at iis mercy	

uables and presented a weird appearance
fred haverson seated himself upon
the counter with a link of sausage in
one hand and some crackers in the other
bob opened two cans of pears and a tin
of preserved meat

   theres no limit to the bill of fare
bob remarked

   but this sort of thing is going to
get monotonous fred objected

   well we can change eating-houses
as often as we like bob replied  and
we must select some place where we can
do a little cooking can you make cof-
fee

   sure

   cook meat 

   of course

   then were all right well lie able
to find fresh meat for quite a time in the
refrigerators then well have to descend
to bacon oh well have plenty to eat
as long as we remain in town

  how about something to drink
haverson asked  the water-works are
deserted of course and the water in the
mains will be getting stale before many
days and neither of us is a boozer

   weve got all kinds of time to find
a well and the right to look in any ones
yard for it bob answered  forget
about those things-well get along all
right what we want to think about is
this confounded mystery what on earth
do you suppose it is 

   its my private opinion answered
haverson  that the whole town has
gone insane fancy not being able to
walk through ordinary air ive got a
notion to go out and have a try myself 
bob calkins grasped him by the arm
 thats exactly what several thousand
persons did and found they were unable
to get back he said  dont get to
thinking about that lets get down to
work maybe theyve solved the mystery
since morning

  they went on through the deserted
city seeing no one bob had been wise
enough to take several candles from the
grocery

   well need them he explained to
haverson  therell be no electric
lights to-night-no workmen at the plant
and well not be able to find any kero-
sene - lamps in the electrical building
 to-morrow said haverson  well

go out in the suburbs find some house
where the people formerly burned kero-
sene and collect a few lamps

  they reached the great electrical
building in which the telegraph company
had its headquarters the operating-
room was on the seventh floor but 
the ground floor were the general offices

these were deserted

   oreat scott we havent seen a
person on our way down  haverson ex- 
claimed	

    well well find several persons up on
the seventh floor ready to eat us alive for
being late bob replied  dont you
suppose those day-operators want to get
off and have their dinner

    i never appreciated an elevator until
now said haverson as they began their
climb-to the seventh floor elevator-boys
had deserted early in the game

   they reached the seventh floor at last
and started down the long corridor to
their ears came the noise of a sounder-
some one seemed to be calling headquar-
ters frantically

  they entered the first room and hung
up their hats and coats no one was
there then they threw open the door
leading to the general operating-room

  no burst of noise welcomed them-
no frantic ticking of keys and relays and
sounders

  headquarters was deserted there was
not a single man sitting before a key

   what- began haverson

    theyre gone   bob cried

   but-what-

    deserted like the others nice bunch
of telegraphers   bob cried

   i dont know as i blame them
haverson said looking around the room

 this thing is getting on my nerves  

  bob calkins hurried over to him and
grasped him roughly by the arm

   buck up fred  he said  youve
been my particular friend for several
years and i want you to stick by me
now

   youre going to stay-when every
one else is gone haverson asked

    jvere going to stay replied bob

   but-

   nonsense man forget the infernal
mystery and play that you are a boy out
for a lark who ever had such a chance
lie fore why weve got the whole city


thu argosy

for a playground you can play at
mayor and ill be the council and well
close the saloons and have all sorts of
fun well be famous fred-only men
with nerve enough to stav in merton and
all that 

  bob didnt care for the fame but he
was trying to make haverson see the thing
in a different light

   and whats the harm   he went on
 no one has been hurt in the city noth-
ing unusual has happened here its just
that confounded so-called invisible wall
out there that keeps everything out and
that has frightened the people half to
death we dont know anything about
it and we dont care well just hold
clown our jobs think of the fun of
being the only people that can tell those
outside what is going on-the only teleg-
raphers in town 

   and i guess the only men in the
city added haverson  we didnt see
any one remember

   then its all the better wont you
stick with me fred theres no plague
or disease and nothing it seems to harm
us stick until we are frightened by
something worse than that invisible wall
anyway

   i-i dont know- fred began

   come on old man dont be a cow-
ard  therell be two of us remember
well have all sorts of fun but its not
the fun fred some one ought to be
in town and were the only ones left that
can use a key were the historians of
this affair fred we can write magazine
articles when we get out if we want to
and then we ought to hold down our
jobs

   but even the chief has left pro-
tested fred

   what do we care you can play
chief if you want to lets be game
enough to stick to our posts

  fred walked to the window and looked
out at the lifeless street below

   ive got no one in the world except
my old dad said bob  he was pulling
the train that first ran into the wall id
rather run the risk of never seeing him
again than to desert now and have him
call me a coward-and thats what hed
do 

  haverson whirled upon him

   i havent any one bob lie said-

 not even an old father if you have
 nerve enough to stay so have i

mysteries and a voice

 at the junction tower the operator
 kept stabbing at the key calling head-
 quarters in merton he got no answer

 old jerry calkins who stood near
 was looking at his watch

  in five minutes my boy will report
 for work he said  and then youll get
 an answer

  i doubt it muttered the operator to
 the mayor who was bending over the key

  i swear i wouldnt stick in town not
 knowing what sort of an infernal thing
 is going on in this neighborhood

 the five minutes passed and still the
 operators call went unanswered an-
 other five minutes were ticked off there
 was a trace of keen disappointment and
 pain in jerrys face

  the boyll be there if lies alive he
 kept repeating  he wont desert-he
 wont desert

  its too much for the boys nerves
 jerry said the mayor kindly

  hell be there i say-if lies alive
 just then the wire was  broken the
 operator shut his key with a snap the
 wire was opened again and there came
 the answer to the call

  << J J>

 merton merton questioned the
 tower operator

  it j 

 whos talking

  calkins

 the tower operator turned around in
 his chair

  calkins talking the old engineer 
 was right he said

  i knew it jerry cried  i knew
 my boy wouldnt desert

 but the operator had turned to the
 key again and was asking questions as
 rapidly as lie could tick them off whefi
 the answers came he called them aloud

 hows everything he inquired

  every one has deserted we found
 headquarters without anybody on duty

  any one left in town  

  we didnt see a person on our way
 to work
at mis

mercy



   you say we whos the other one 
   haverson hes with me

   will you stick  the tower operator
demanded

   yes

  the wire was  broken  again and
from miles across the country there came
a message from the division chief who
had been listening

   your message overheard superin-
tendent of company says he thanks cal-
kins and haverson for their nerve and
attention to duty asks that they as-
sume charge of office and companys
property and arrange it among them-
selves so that one man will be on duty all
the time the company will pay each of
you fifty dollars a day and in addition
will not forget your service

  haverson was standing over bobs key
when that message came in

   tell him well stick with or without
that raise of pay he said

  but bob was already working the key
and that information was wired to the
superintendent

  then fred went to another key and
talked with the north while bob re-
mained talking to the south through the
junction tower bob asked whether any
progress had been made toward solving
the mystery

   scientists are now making their way
completely around the city following the
invisible wall came the reply  ex-
pect to arrive back at tower to-night
some time and turn in report what are
conditions inside

   criminals looted city bob wired
 stores and residences broken open and
articles of value taken several bank
vaults blown open

   troops are searching every one who
comes out was the answer  and have
already arrested many of the looters

what else

   we are taking liberty of getting food
in groceries and bakeries water in
mains is growing stale but well locate a
well guess well have to find an oil-stove
and cook up here in the operating-room
if we have to be on duty continually
no lights of course except candles
believe the city is wholly deserted went
up on tower of building and couldn t
locate a human being on any street as
far as i could see growing dark now

but cant see lights anywhere except out-
side invisible wall

  bob closed the key and the tower
operator broke in

   mayor instructs yourself and haver-
son to use all stores necessary and make
yourselves comfortable if you see any-
thing suspicious report immediately be
careful to keep wire in order at your
end the city is cut off from the world
if this wire goes down

   well be careful bob wired

   your father sends his regards and
says for you to stick

    fell dad ill stick

  there was silence then for a time
fred had given the same information to
the north and the two operators having
nothing more to wire walked to the
window and glanced over the city

  there was not a flash of light not a
sound from those streets which were
usually thronged at that hour from the
distance came the bay of a dog it was
indeed a dead city far away they could
see lights where the crowds surrounded-
the town outside the invisible wall

   rather lonesome here observed
fred

   but its all right just the same
added bob quickly  everything de-
pends upon us now fred

  just then haverson uttered a cry
bob sprang to the window again what
he saw startled him

  throughout the city row after row of
street lights were flashing gradually
the entire city was illuminated incan-
descents glowed on roof-gardens and be-
fore theaters but for the absence of
human beings the dead city was alive
once more

   what does it mean haverson
cried

   some good chap has stuck to his job
thats all bob answered  lets say
 hallo  to him  

  he rushed to the telephone to call the
electric-plant but after he had stood
at the instrument for a moment he made
a grimace and hung up the receiver

   i forgot he said  the central
girls are not at work

   im sorry we cant talk to the fel-
lows at the plant added haverson  it
would help some if we could we might
even get them to eat with us no sense




the argosy

in running the electric lights from
what i can see

   look out of the other window in-
structed bob  and see if you can see the
smoke from the plant you generally
can see it from there itll cure your
lonesomeness

  fred hurried to the window

   why theres no smoke  he cried
 thats funny too you can always see
a cloud of it in front of the lights at the
railroad shops

  no smoke laughed bob

  he went over to look fred had
spoken the truth there was not a bit
of smoke hanging over the power-house

   you cant run all the electric lights
in town without making some smoke
said haverson  what do you sup-
pose-

  a call at one of the sounders inter-
rupted him bob answered it it was
the tower

   city seems lit said the tower op-
erator

   all street lights and incandescents
burning bob answered

   peculiar went on the tower  presi-
dent of light company is here and says
all his employees left plant yesterday
with exception of foreman and one crew
and they came out to-day absolutely
no electricians at plant can you ex-
plain

   seems to be no smoke coming from
plant replied bob

  the next question rather staggered the
two operators

  if power for lights is not generated
at plant wjiere does it come from

   dont know bob said

  just then fred ran back from the
window

 the lights have gone out  he cried
and as he spoke the incandescents
went out also and the operating-room
was left with the uncertain glow from
the candles

   lights just went out-all of them
bob wired

   noticed it replied the tower
 wire if anything else unusual occurs
bob got up and left the key

   i guess thats enough unusual stuff
for one night he said  where do you
suppose that power came from fred
 i havent any idea

   it didnt come from the plant that
much is certain they cant generate
power down there without burning coal
and making smoke what do you sup-
pose-

  he stopped and glanced at haverson
with an expression of wonderment in his
face the telephone bell was ringmg

 somebodys alive in this old town
besides us after all bob gasped  an-
swer it fred while i watch the key
haverson sprang to the telephone and
took down the receiver

   hallo hallo  he called then
he took his ear away quickly  the con-
founded chump-whoever it is-doesnt
stop ringing he exclaimed  he wont
give me a chance to talk listen to him
ring

  bob rushed to the instrument and put
the receiver to his ear there was a
buzz-the telephone was still ringing

   thats a nice trick he commented
 if some maniac has got into the tele-
phone-office and cooked this up-

  he ceased speaking and his jaw
dropped

  what is it haverson asked

   listen over here by the door
what do you hear  

   why other phones are ringing

   i should say they are lets go into
the hall

  they went into the corridor to their
ears came the incessant ringing

    every bell in the building is going  
exclaimed fred

   what  earth do you suppose-
bob began and then he saw the look in
haversons face and stopped

   well i hope whoever is doing it
will get tired pretty soon he added
 this confounded noise-

   i believe other bells besides those in
our building are ringing fred inter-
rupted  come here by the window

   sounds like it bob assented  but
we cant tell from here remember there
are several hundred telephones in this
building

   youd think there were several thou-
sand from the noise they make im get-
ting nervous

   dont  snapped bob

  they stood beside the window listen-
ing it was enough to make any one
nervous-the great dark dead city with
at his

mercy



not a sound in it except the ringing of
thousands of telephone-bells and the
ringing continued five minutes passed
-ten-fifteen

    will it never stop  haverson cried
 what can it be i dont see how mor-
tal man could do it

   mortal man is doing it all right
you can bet on that  exclaimed bob

   the noise will set me crazy haver-
son insisted

  it wtas bad for the nerves-doubly bad
under the circumstances twenty min-
utes after the ringing of the bells began
both operators were walking the floor of
the room holding their hands to their
ears

   weve got to stop this said bob
 if we have to unhook every receiver in
the building

   lets begin with this floor and try
it fred suggested

    id better call the towrer and report
bob added take a candle and begin
operations

  haverson lit a candle and went out to
enter room after room and take the re-
ceiver off the telephone-hook bob cal-
kins sat down before the key and called
the tower

   i the tower answered

    every telephone-bell in city as well
as we can judge is ringing bob re-
ported  and has been ringing for al-
most half an hour  were not sure
about the entire city of course but we
know that every bell in our building and
bells in some adjoining buildings are at
work

  no one talks over the telephone
came the question

  no the bell will not stop ringing
the noise is setting us crazy haverson
is going through the building taking the
receivers off the hooks

    i will report to scientists when they
return said the tower operator

   o k answered bob

  as he closed the key haverson stum-
bled back into the room his face white

  great scott i cant do any more
alone he gasped  its awful bob
im-im afraid  

   buck up old man of course i
know it is creepy but telephone-bells
cant hurt us

   it isnt the bells its the fact that

all this is so blamed mysterious that all
the bells are ringing and we do not
know why i wonder what next

   it is hard to tell there-

  the bells suddenly stopped have
you ever been plunged in the twinkling
of an eye from a fearful din into com-
plete silence even if you have not you
can imagine the result the silence
seemed oppressive-rseemed to pain

   this-this is awful  haverson
gasped

  there came another quick ring at the
telephone-bell just an ordinary ring
such as an ordinary  central  might
give bob ran to the instrument and put
the receiver to his ear

  hallo he cried looking back at
haverson and winking

  to his surprise an answer came back
in a mans voice 

   hallo 

 hallo hallo who are you
bob cried

fred ran to his side and stood waiting
bobs question was not answered in-
stead a sepulchral voice full and deep
which seemed to speak in measured ac-
cents said

   the city is doomed this is your
last warning you have until noon to-
morrow to get outside the town

   say old man what is this-a joke 
asked bob

   your last warning came the voice
over the wire  the city is doomed it
is in my power no mercy will be shown
you after noon to-morrow

chapter iv

a warning on the wrire

  the receiver dropped from bobs
nerveless hand for fully a minute he
and haverson faced each other without
speaking the ticking of the sounder
broke the spell

  what-what do you think fred
demanded

   some ones ghastly joke commented
bob though he didnt feel sure about it

  he knew that fred mas at the point of
giving way however and he wanted to
prevent that

  he sprang to the key it was the junc-
tion tower calling


the argosy

  anything new the tower asked

   plenty bob replied

  then he told the tower operator of the
whole affair even going so far as to de-
scribe the voice to the best of his abil-
ity the tower operator answered that
he would give the report to the authori-
ties and also to the scientists

   the scientists have returned he
added  and are now holding a coun-
cil

  bob closed the key and walked with
haverson to the window the moon
had risen bright and full and the great
city looked indeed like a silent tomb in
the pale moonlight

  the muddled voice of an intoxicated
loafer would have been sweet music the
clang of a street-car gong welcome in-
deed

   are-are we going to stay-after
getting that message over the telephone
fred asked

   of course well stay  bob replied
 dont let that message frighten you
i have an idea a few clever thieves have
remained behind have connected the
telephones at central and after ringing
every instrument in town have given that
message dont you see they thought
every person who remained would answer
the telephone and hear them they would
frighten those who stayed and make them
leave and then the city would be theirs

   but if they locate us-

   howll they do that unless they hap-
pen to see us how will they ever find
two men in all this town not knowing
where to look when there are so many
thousands of buildings and so many
places for a man to hide lets fight it
out a little longer anyway	i

   im with you-as long as we can
stand it haverson replied

  bob realized that his one object was
to keep haverson busy- keep him so busy
that he wouldnt have time to think about
things and let the mysteries get on his
nerves that would be easy in the morn-
ing for they could gather supplies but
there was nothing to do at night haver-
son would not sleep-said he could not
sleep and the night dragged terribly

  an hour or so passed and then the
junction tower called again bob sat
down before the key and haverson stood
beside him

    i bob replied to the call

    scientists have concluded their ses-
sion and have formulated report the
message said you are asked to give
them all the aid in your power as you
are believed to be the only honest men
left inside and everything depends upon
you please give best of attention as i
wire report and ask all the questions you
desire so there will be a complete under-
standing is the other operator there
 i bob answered

   have him read message also

    i flashed the answer

   attention scientists have com-
pleted circuit of the city and find that
invisible wall extends completely around
it they examined every few inches and
found no loophole it begins on the
ground and extends at least thirty feet
in air on the perpendicular it may run
beyond that but they had no means to
investigate

    this peculiar wall i nothing seem-
ingly except ordinary air except that it
does not give the least fraction and to
push against it is like pushing against a
wall of brick or stone the atmosphere
lias no unusual color or odor though the
delicate instruments used showed a slight
bluish tinge in the air at times which may
or not be due to the present condition of
the ether or to a slight electrical dis-
turbance following the thunder-storm of
a day ago

   while the thing is a mystery and
never dreamed of before the scientists
are of the opinion-merely an opinion
this without scientific truths to make it
a fact - that some peculiar force is at
work but that the force is exerted by a
human being or human beings who have
discovered something sensationally new
in physics the experts are at a loss to
designate the nature of this force-if such
it may be called

   the greatest mystery is that while
no one can enter from the outside any-
thing can come from the inside without
trouble and without experiencing any
unusual feeling are you getting this all
right 

  o k bob tapped

  now listen this has been discov-
ered  the invisible wall surrounding the
city follows closely the outside rail of
the merton belt line traction compa-
at his mercy	

nys road at first the scientists were of
the opinion that the peculiar force was
being exerted through this rail but upon
close examination they could find no indi-
cations that such was a fact they knew
also of course that the traction company
has not completed its work and that
while it has constructed its rough road-
bed and laid its rails there has been no
electrical installation as yet-no trolley
wire or even poles to support one

    it is the opinion of the experts there-
fore that the person or persons who are
exerting this peculiar new and wonderful
force are merely using the outside rail of
the belt line as a boundary because it was
easy to establish and follow and is just
outside the city limits all the way around
the town

   they are of the opinion that this
force whatever it is is being manufac-
tured inside the city and that therefore
persons or at least one person with some
ulterior motive against the city is within
its limits doing his or their diabolical
work you are instructed to watch be
careful as everything depends upon you
two men

    do not risk yoursel ves any more than
is absolutely necessary try to keep out
of sight the persons doing this work
are perhaps hidden but the scientists say
such a great force cannot be exerted with-
out considerable work  matter what
its nature and they ask you to watch for
smoke or any indication that power of any
sort is being generated

   your recent message concerning the
telephone warning was shown them and
they are more than ever convinced that
it is human beings we are fighting and
not some supernatural force they say
again that everything depends upon you
two men and while you are not asked
to risk your lives you are asked to do
everything possible before leaving the
city to solve the mysterv

    o k flashed bob

    will you stick  the tower operator
demanded

    well stick bob wired

  he closed the key and whirled around
to face haverson

   funny  fred commented

    looks mighty plain to me said bob
 some scoundrel lias discovered a great
secret of physics and is using his discov-

ery for ill instead of good-thats all
what he intends to do with this city is
more than we know i dont think liell
destroy it- have an idea that he has
frightened the people away and is using
his confounded invisible wall to keep
them out so that he and his confederates
if he has any can loot and enrich them-
selves there are fortunes upon fortunes
left in town in spite of the looting that
has occurred already

   you forget one thing haverson re-
plied  the city is surrounded by people
by troops and officers how will this man
-if it is a man-be able to take away his
loot after he collects it 

  bob calkins laughed

    i have an idea he said  that if i
was powerful enough to keep people and
animals and even railroad trains from
passing through a section of ordinary
air id be powerful enough to take away
all the loot i could collect

   well i wish wed never encountered
this freak situation fred answered
 but since we have i suppose we can
make the best of it i hope those sci-
entists have the correct idea and that it
is human beings we are pitted against if
that is true it isnt so bad  cant say
ill run away from ordinary human beings
unless they get too strong for us but
the man that can make an invisible wall
is perhaps also strong enough to destroy
two men like ourselves

   we have until noon to-morrow any-
way said bob

   until noon to-day you mean it is
two oclock in the morning now

   anyway i think the fellow who
talked over the telephone is working a
big bluff calkins went on  he doesnt
know exactly where we are and so we
have the advantage of him

   but we arent sure he doesnt know
where we are protested haverson

    well lets stop talking about it keep
our eyes open and take the chance bob
replied  id rather die trying to do
something than face my old dad after
deserting i know what hed tell me and
it wouldnt be complimentary-you can
bet on that

  the sounder began its ticking again
and bob went to the key

    if you want to gather supplies the
tower operator wired  it is suggested


the argosyi

that you leave the operating-room this
morning between eight and ten oclock
that will give you two hours which is
ample time well understand where you
are and not think it unusual if you do
not answer during that time if you dont
answer soon after ten oclock however
well know there is something wrong

   good plan and well abide by it
bob answered

  he closed the key but immediately
there came another call and he turned
to answer it

    i he said

   you will do well came the message
 to leave the city at daybreak you have
been warned

   great scott  cried haverson

   wait  bob implored
lie worked the key calling the tower
 did you send that message  he de-
manded

   no the tower answered

   then who in the world- bob be-
gan

  the circuit opened bob closed the
key and then came more words from the
unknown operator

   i am the master of the world i ad-
mire brave men but say to the two oper-
ators in the electrical building that re-
sistance is useless leave the city at day-
break  it will not be safe for you to re-
main longer than noon to-morrow this
is the last warning

   some operator along the line joking
bob wired to the tower

  the answer came immediately

   cut out wire except from tower to
headquarters and see

  this was immediately done the tower
operator reported soon that communica-
tion beyond the tower had been inter-
rupted	

  then the mysterious operator cut in
you see it is not some operator
fooling i am master of the world and
i warn you because i admire brave men
but i do not admire them enough to
allow them to prevent me from accom-
plishing my purpose icave the city be-
fore noon to-morrow

   are you tht fellow who telephoned 
bob demanded on the key

   u j 

   and who turned the lights on and
off

   a  n

   well what else can you do did
you throwr the invisible wall around the
city

    il j 

   that confounded thing is the work of
human hands then

   the work of a brain came the ego-
tistical answer- the work of the great-
est brain in the world are you satis-
fied

    im satisfied that you are the greatest
scoundrel of the age bob replied
 youre nothing but a man in spite of
your confounded mysterious power-a
man that uses his brain for evil instead
of good and ive never yet met a man i
was afraid of

   if you are wise you will be afraid
of me came the answer

chapter v

the first blow

   well what do you think of that
bob asked haverson turning from the
key

  the tower operator had cut off and
was reporting the conversation bob sup-
posed to the authorities

   what do you think about it   fred
demanded in return

   i think it is some maniac with a great
deal of nerve and bluff

   but you are not remembering the in-
visible wall a man that can create that
is liable to be able to do anything

    im not forgetting the invisible wall
bob retorted  but i want to see him do
something else-something that actually
threatens us-before i run away from
him what do you think of the report of
the scientists

   they talked a lot without saying any-
thing haverson replied  they seem
to be as far from solving theunystcry as
before

   you noticed what they said about the
belt-line track

   yes but they also said they believed
it was merely used as a boundary for the
wall what is the history of the belt
line 

   it is innocent enough explained
bob  some months ago a corporation
headed by a man named hellinger se-


at his mercy



cured rights from the county and state
made arrangements with property own-
ers and started to build an electric belt
line around the city just outside the lim-
its

    their intention i believe - is to ra-
diate from this circular belt line other
electric lines running into different parts
of the state you see every car no mat-
ter from what direction it approached
was to  loop the loop and enable pas-
sengers to reach almost any part of the
city

   the belt-line track has been roughly
laid but no poles or trolley wires have
been erected yet and the power plant
i understand has only a part of the elec-
trical machinery installed im inclined
to agree with the opinion of the scientists
that the belt line has nothing to do with
the mystery except that it has been chosen
as a natural boundary for the invisible
wall

   if there were wires and a general
electrical installation along the line i
might think that the belt line was con-
nected more closely with the mystery

   are we going to remain here in the
face of the warnings we have re-
ceived fred asked

   yes replied bob firmly  at least
well remain as long as we can itll take
more than a bluff to drive us out

  all right laughed haverson i
can stand it if you can

  bob walked back and forth in the room
for a time and finally stood for several
minutes looking out of the window over
the city

   fred he said finally  were going
to move

   to move  haverson cried

   yes-move that chap-whoever he
is-knows where we are and if he wanted
to start any devilment hed know where
to find us here we are seven stories from
the ground-and hed have a chance to
cut us off and starve us out if he couldnt
get us out any other way

  but wherell we go haverson in-
quired

   well take an emergency outfit and
go to some other building where well
make connections with the tower wire
down at the branch office on washington
avenue the wires leave the conduits and
run over the-buildings for several blocks

well make a connection there run the
wire into some obscure building and go
to work as usual and we must do it
immediately-before daylight

   but hell find us objected fred

-	 perhaps but hell have to look for
us first and hell not know exactly where
to look well gain time at any rate
they began their preparations imme-
diately while haverson went to the
storerooms and gathered the necessary
paraphernalia bob sat down before the
key and called the junction tower

   do not call us or expect us to an-
swer for an hour or so he wired wait
until we call you

   why  the tower demanded

   cant tell you for obvious reasons
and when we call again understand that
we talk to tower only and not to other
stations outside city we cant trouble
to talk to more than one station every
thing must go through tower

   o k the tower flashed

  fred entered the operating-room as
bob finished and they gathered up the
things and went into the corridor and
began the descent to the street

  it was bright moonlight and they tried
to keep in the shadows as much as possi-
ble because they did not know what to
expect or whom to expect

  they had not walked three blocks be-
fore every electric light in the city
suddenly flashed and remained burning

   hes trying to spot us bob cried
 down this alley here and keep out
of the light as much as possible

  they hurried on block after block
crossing street after street bob stopped
at a cigar-store and took a box of cigars
fred invaded a grocery to get cheese and
crackers and then they hurried on

  they reached the building which con-
tained the branch office and bob led the
way up-stairs and to the roof there bob
tapped wire after wire until they found
the one which ran south and got an an-
swer from the tower

  then they followed this wire over
several buildings until they came to the
one on the corner

   i guess this builiding will do as well
as any bob said  of course we dont
want to locate in the branch office for
thats as bad as being in headquarters
well run a wire into this building its


the argosy

an old one and about the last place any
one would look for us

  they worked frantically for a red
streak in the east told them that daylight
would soon be at hand the electric
lights went out again and they had to
use candles after making the proper
connection they carried the wire through
a trap-door in the roof down a long lad-
der through a musty garret and so to the
top floor then they took it down the
stairs floor after floor until the ground
was reached

  on the corner was a jewelry-store in
the rear was a small room originally de-
signed as a workshop with ample light
from windows and skylight the back
room could not be seen from the treet
it was an ideal place for their project

  while haverson fastened a key and
sounder to a table and went about put-
ting the apparatus in working order bob
left the building and hurried across the
street to a grocery-store he filled a
large box with food and carried it back
to the little rear room

  fred went with him on the next trip
and before they finished they had an
ample store of provisions in their new
headquarters

   bob rifled a liardware-store for an oil-
stove fred got five gallons of oil from
the grocery then they both went to a
furniture establishment and carried back
a cot and two chairs one a rocker

   on their last trip they entered a dry-
goods emporium and selected heavy
blankets and a few towels

  it was dawn now too light for them
to be in the streets unless they wished to
risk discovery

   breakfast  bob demanded and
laughing he began to prepare it

  they didnt have to leave the rear
room for water and soon they sat down
to fried eggs and bacon and coffee
which bob declared was not quite as
good as- they were used to having but
a great deal better than nothing

   and now said haverson  wed
better call the tower

  fred called and the tower operator
answered immediately

   thought you had disappeared he
said

   were still on the job fred re-
plied

   why did you take that hour off

   dont ask questions because we
cant answer them fred tapped

  the wire  broke and the unknown
operator cut in

   it is now break of day he said
 i trust you men remember my warn-
ing you have until noon to leave the
city of merton

   weve decided to stay a little
longer bob said for he had relieved
fred at the key when the unknown
cut in

   you are warned ill say no more 
 well not be sorry to be deprived
of your conversation bob wired

   fool  came the solitary word as
answer then the wire was still

  an hour after that the operator in
the junction tower out of the kindness
of his heart began to give bob and
haverson a condensed report of the
doings in the outer world

  congress the report said had ap-
pointed a committee to proceed to the
city of merton and make an investiga-
tion distinguished  scientists were
coming from abroad the eyes of the
world were upon merton and upon the
two operators there who braved an un-
known peril to give to those outside a
truthful description of what was taking
place within

  those who were formerly residents of
merton and especially those who had
interests there were frantic millions
of dollars worth of property was at the
mercy of the mysterious unknown who
called himself master of the world

  haverson stood at bobs side as this
report was coming in there was not
much to interest them but it served to
pass away the time in fact the time
passed faster than they realized the
tower operator ceased sending and bob
whirled around to talk to fred

   i dont like this hero business he
said  were just attending to our
duty thats all

  there came a call on the sounder
and bob answered it was the myste-
rious unknown

   do you realize that it is ten oclock
in the morning and that you have only
two hours in which to leave the city
he demanded	

   didnt realize it was so late bob
at his mercy	

flashed  weve been getting the news

   i heard you came the answer
 youd better move now

  were very comfortable thanks

   i have warned you to leave by
noon

   but we prefer to remain said bob
  the answer rather startled them

   at one minute after the hour of noon
i will destroy the high tower on the
electrical building after that i shall
exert forces over which i have control
and gradually demolish the building
floor by floor

   pardon me old man but that reads
like a lie wired bob

   you are brainless to doubt my
power have i not already demon-
strated it

just the same we arent going to
run away from town answered bob

   then the city will be your tomb
said the unknown  i have given my
last warning 

  bob whirled around and faced haver-
son

  what do you think of that he
asked

   well hell not injure us particular-
ly by destroying the electrical build-
ing fred answered  personally i
am glad we moved i dont believe he
can do it of course but i dont want
to be in that building and run the risk
while he conducts any experiments
were ten blocks away thank good-
ness  

   and from this rear window said
bob  we can see the tower and the
upper three stories of the electrical
building if there is any destruction
we can see it from here i dont care
for a ringside seat at any exhibition like
our friend promises

   neither do  added fred

  the tower operator called them again
and fred who was nearest the key an-
swered him

   we have overheard peculiar mes-
sage you just received the tower oper-
ator said  scientists ask you to watch
closely and report any unusual occur-
rences if there are any they want it
understood however that this service is
optional on your part if you really
think there is danger they want you to
feel at liberty to leave

 bob pushed fred to one side and took
 charge of the key

  this is calkins talking he wired
  is my father in the tower

  yes

  ask him whether i shall remain or
 come out

 there was silence for a moment then
 the answer came

  your father says for you not to be
 a coward 

  tell him ill not bob replied and
 closed the key

 he faced haverson again

 you heard that he asked mv
 dad will have to leave the road soon
 because hes getting old of course he
 owns his little place here in town but
 thats about all and he looks to me to
 support him in his old age he tells
 me to stick 

  well stick   fred said

 at five minutes before noon the un-
 known operator called them and bob
 answered

 you are going to remain the un-
 known asked

 we are

  very well youll soon know better
 than to doubt

 bob did not answer that it seemed
 that no answer was necessary with
 haverson he walked to the window
 where by looking over the tops of the
 small buildings across a near-by square
 they could see the lofty tower of the
 electrical building and two or three
 stories below it

  it is noon bob said

 they turned their eyes to the tower
 suddenlv it crumbled into fragments
 and fell 

 they could hear the great crash as
 stone was hurled downward hundreds of
 feet to the roofs of other buildings and
 to the streets

chapter vi

the citys death-warrant

 their faces blanched their hearts
 beating like trip-hammers their eyes
 bulging-they watched the destruction

 another minute and then the top
 story of the great structure began to
 crumble away first a corner of it


the argosy

 seemed to fall to pieces and then the
 destruction spread and sections of the
 building were thrown outward with
 great force finally the upper story was
 gone

  there was no smoke no flame noth-
ing to indicate the nature of the destruc-
tive force the building simply stood
then fell

   as they watched the next story began
to go and then the third from the top
disappeared and then there arose from
the ground great clouds of dust that
obscured the view

   but crashes and shocks told that the
building was being demolished story by
story floor by floor as the unknown had
threatened

   haver sons quick sob of fear brought
bob back to the realization of things

    well hes done it  bob exclaimed

   but how-with what

   dont ask me im not up to solv-
ing this mystery im sorry that build-
ing is gone for i was proud of it-proud
that i had a job in it but it neednt
bother us any i fixed the wire of
course we can use it even if the elec-
trical building has been demolished

  he turned to the window again the
crashes had ceased the dust clouds
still filled the air but as they watched
these clouds gradually settled and they
saw that where the electrical building
had stood there was now nothing but air
bob leading the way they ran to the
roof of the building to which they had
moved from the roof they could look
across the square

  they saw a mass of ruins heaps of
stone and mortar and wood crushed to
kindling the building had been torn
to pieces great steel beams and girders
were twisted and gnarled as though they
had been grape-vines

  bob noticed one thing - the ruins
showed that the power of destruction
whatever it was had come from the
north the demolished building had
been scattered toward the south over the
square

   if we had been there- haverson
began

    but we were not laughed bob

   it wasnt a natural laugh there was
nervousness and a little fear in it but it
had the effect of calming them

  they rushed back down the stairs and
to their room the tower operator was
calling them repeatedly bob answered
what happened was asked

   electrical building mass of ruins
bob wired and then he waited

  he could picture the scene in the
juncture tower - the white faces the
fear expressed in them the bewilderment
of the scientific experts presently the
junction tower spoke again

   kindly answer questions as nearly
correct as possible what seemed to be
manner of destruction

   could not tell bob replied  we
watched from window tower seemed
to crumble and fall toward the south
after short interval upper story began
to go beginning at corner and spread-
ing gradually building gradually torn
to pieces

  any smoke or flame

   no

    sound of explosion  

   no

   nothing at all to denote nature of
destructive power

   no bob replied

    entire building destroyed you say 
yes nothing left but mass of ruins
scattered over public square

  yet you are alive

  yes haverson and i are all right
how does that happen how does
it happen wires are in order  

  bob hesitated about replying but
finally reached for the key

   we anticipated trouble and moved
headquarters he said  that was what
we were doing early this morning when
we took that two hours off connected
emergency wire and arranged things so
that destruction of building did not cut
us off

  there was a pause then word from
the superintendent who evidently had
been listening to the conversation

  good work boys the company will
not forget this

  the junction tower cut in again

    are you in a safe place  

   dont know whether any place in
town is safe or not answered bob
 but i guess were in a place where
well not be found easily

   be careful came the warning from
the superintendent
at his

mercy



  the dots and dashes ceased bob
left the key and helped haverson open
some food as they ate they discussed
the situation

  what are we going to do fred
asked  i cant see any particular use
in remaining here except that well be
able to tell the outside world how the
city is destroyed we arent stopping
the destruction and were not helping
the people outside to get in

   ive been thinking of that bob
said  but how can we stop the work
of this scoundrel whoever he is when
we do not know how his work is done
and dont know where he is a man
who can destroy a great building as
easily as he has done can do almost any-
thing so well have to be careful how
we go about it

    i take it for granted that we are the
only people inside the town except him-
self if we try to conquer him and
make a bad break hell be liable to des-
troy us and then the city would be at
his mercy even more than now the
only thing we can do as i see it now is
to take it easy and try to locate him
and after we do that we can move ac-
cordingly

   do you think he will destroy the
entire city  haverson inquired

   i dont know what to think con-
fessed bob  i cant imagine his ob-
ject if it is to loot the town hell not
destroy it - at least not until he has
done the looting

  but how can he hope to escape
asked fred if he loots the town it
is surrounded by troops and theyll
catch him if he attempts to leave with
his plunder

   a man who can destroy a building
as easily as he did- began bob

  fred did not say more it was evi-
dent that they faced a problem beyond
their comprehension

   well bob added  we can wait
 do you suppose he thinks we were
destroyed in the electrical building
fred remarked

   thats what id like to know said
bob  he didnt cut in while we were
reporting to the junction tower i have
an idea that he had tapped the wire near
the electrical building and that his
connection was destroyed

   	a

   and perhaps his connection is not
destroyed but he has not been where he
could hear the sounder

  if that is the case we are liable to
hear from him again bob replied

  they left the room and journeyed to
the robf once more and there they
looked over the dead city there was
not a trace of smoke in any direction
not a human being nothing to indicate
the quarter from whence came the great
power which had destroyed the elec-
trical building

  bob laughed as he saw fred get be-
hind a chimney

  no use to try to hide he said

 you may be getting directly in his line
of vision instead of away from it i
dont think i am a coward but when
i fight i like to see my foe or at least
know where he is

   wed better go back then fred
replied  we ought not to take
chances for if he does locate us hes
liable to end our days on earth

  so they descended to the ground floor
again and went to the little rear room
the sounder was ticking frantically
bob rushed across the room and an-
swered

   anything else happened  the junc-
tion tower asked

   nothing else bob replied

   let us know immediately if other
property is destroyed

   ill do it

   arrange with haverson so that one
of you can answer our call every hour 
day and night

   well arrange it bob replied

  the wire was  broken and there
was a silence for a moment then the
dots and dashes began again but they
were coming from the dreaded unknown
instead of from the junction tower

   i see you escaped destruction the
unknown said  you must have wit-
nessed my work however have you
nerve enough to remain in the city after
seeing that  

   were still here old man answered
bob

   i warned you to leave before noon
and you did not therefore you must
take the consequences if you start at
once you may be able to get out of the
city safely but if you delay another


the argosy

hour youll never reach the outside alive
before midnight youll sleep in a sepul-
cher of ruins

    we are not leaving bob replied

   so be it came the answer  you
have bravery but not brains you can-
not hide from me will you leave the
city 

    why do you wish us to leave  bob
asked

    because it does not suit my purpose
to have you remain

   what is your purpose

   you ask too much wired the un-
known

    if you are master of the world and
have the city and us at your mercy why
should you be afraid to tell us your
purpose	

   i am not afraid to tell you but
i refuse to do it

   i say you are afraid you do not
have  confidence in the power you say
you possess

  have i not came the answer
 very well ill tell you my purpose
and in telling you  speak your death-
warrant for if i speak you shall
never leave the city alive

   speak  commanded bob

   you talk for yourself how about
the other operator

  bob turned and looked at haverson
freds face went white but he stum-
bled forward grasped the key and
tapped his answer

    speak 

  the unknown wired again

   very well my purpose is to crush
the city of merton to leave it a mass
of ruins to demolish every building to
tear stone from stone and brick from
brick and then to sweep it with con-
suming fire the city is in my power
now nothing can save it nothing
can cheat me of my vengeance

    you are not then going to loot the
city of its wealth and escape with it  
bob asked

   i do not care for wealth i have
possessed wealth for years-wealth i
inherited and wealth that i amassed
it has brought me many things chief
among which is my revenge i shall
destroy the city - all of it except the
building in which i now am-and then
i shall go my way

   you forget said bob  that you
are writing your own doom the city
is surrounded by thousands of people
and by troops you may destroy it but
youll never reach the outside how
will you escape the vengeance of the
citizens outside  

   the same force which tears the city
to pieces shall be thrown against the
foolish people who would oppose me
the unknown answered  though thou-
sands stand in my way they shall be
swept from the face of the earth hurled
from my path he who tries to oppose
me dies nowr you have learned my
purpose - and for this knowledge you
pay with your lives

   one moment bob flashed  who
are you and why do you desire revenge
against the city of merton

  ill tell you no more said the un-
known operator  you have one hour
in which to communicate with the out-
side i grant you this last favor at
the end of the hour the destruction of
the city will begin you may think it
peculiar  did not crush the city while
its thousands of people were within do
you wish to know why

   yes bob answered

   because i know what lingering
agony is i know the mercy in a quick
death  know the feelings of the peo-
ple of merton now upon the outside
who count the seconds while their homes
and fortunes are being swept away i
want to send those thousands of people
out into the world penniless to make
them lifelong slaves to the terrible mem-
ory of how it happened in that way
my revenge will live long

   to annihilate them would be mer-
ciful indeed to hear their groans and
shrieks to see their tears and their agony
-that will be sweet for me i am done
with talk you have your hour - and
perhaps youll count the minutes and the
seconds and know what fear is when
you see buildings tumbling about you
and flames shooting toward the sky this
is my last communication-i will cut the
wire

  bob had fallen back in the chair as
the unknown sent the dots and dashes
flying into the sounder fred was be-
side him his hands trembling his breath
coming in gasps
jacobis juggernaut



  in all the room-in all the city as far
as they knew-there was no sound save
that of the dots and dashes-that mer-
ciless ticking which announced the doom
of the city and of the two men within
its limits

  but as the unknown destroyer con-
cluded and threatened to cut the wire
bobs hand reached for the key again

   wa- he began

  then he sat back and groaned the
wire was cut

  there was now no means of commun-
ication left with the people of the out-
side 

  and there above the silent sounder
in the little back room of the jewelry-
store a small clock ticked away the sec-
onds and narrowed the gap between life
and death

                         to be continued

               the strange night experience that befell a restaurant pro-
               prietor as he motored to his country home for his health

  t ot the pleasantest kind of a

    night for an automobile ride
harris jacobi remarked as he settled
back in the rear seat of the big car
 particularly when one is taking it for
his health

   it might be better his chauffeur
ventured as the car glided ahead in
response to his pressure of a lever

   well not stay out any longer than
necessary the employer declared
 when we reach the city limits let the
car out-i am tired and want to get
home

   yes sir was the response of the
man at the wheel

 he was gazing intently ahead
through the midnight mist that blan-
keted the streets of new york like a
heavy fog

  jacobi pulled closer around himself
the fur robes-the drizzle of rain which
entered the hooded car brought with it
a chill that was of no benefit to one
under the steady care of a physician as
he was

  the restaurant which bore his name-
it stood out in large electric-lighted
letters-was one of the most exclusive
in the bright-light district of new york
and for a generation had been under the
personal management of the owner
but the steady application to business
with its long hours had undermined
jacobis health and in accordance with
his doctors orders he had shifted his

residence to haledon a suburb fifteen
miles up the hudson

  with this move came a change in his
business rules-he came to the city late
in the aijfernoon and left for his home
about midnight and as his physician
directed that he be out in the air as
much as possible he had purchased an
automobile and used this means of
transit to and from his home

  the car glided steadily through the
gloom and a glance without showed
jacobi that they were nearing the out-
skirts of the city

   let her out now he directed and
the chauffeur shot the machine ahead

  in a few moments the houses had been
left behind entirely and they were now
rushing through the open country with
only the street-lights blinking through
the mist like so many fireflies

  now they were descending a slight
grade at the foot of which the driver
knew there was an abrupt turn and al-
though he slowed down a trifle the car
skidded on the wet highway as it took
the curve

  suddenly harris emitted a cry of
alarn and threw on the brakes at the
same instant the heavy car bounded over
an obstruction in the road and came to
jyhalt about fifty feet beyond

  before jacobi could question the
chauffeur burst out a man-we ran
over him the road-was too narrow
to turn out


the argosy

  the restaurant - owner sprang to his
feet

  are you sure he queried

  the driver turned and nodded his
head-he was too frightened to speak

   jacobi shook his shoulder

   then come-we must help him

  his employers words brought the
man back to his senses and jumping
from the car he quickly unfastened one
of the large lamps from the front and
hurried back to where the accident had
happened jacobi followed closely at
his heels

  as the two men neared the spot the
lamps rays showed only too plainly the
truth of the chauffeurs words there
before them in the middle of the road-
way lay the prostrate form of a nan

  for an instant harris paused and as
his employer came abreast of him he
cried  if i have killed him-ill never
run a machine again 

  jacobi seized his arm and literally
pulled him to the side of the injured
man whom he bent over and examined
critically while the chauffeur hung
back fearful of the worst

   hes not dead jacobi declared in
an undertone  hurry to the car and
back it up carefully then well rush
to the nearest doctor

   you think-hell live harris que-
ried anxiously  you dont think hell
die

   i do not know was the curt re-
sponse  bring the car here

  the other ran swiftly to do as bid-
den and springing into the front seat
reversed the gears and the big machine
slowly backed toward the man wthose
head rested on jacobis knee when it
stopped harris leaped to the ground
ready to assist

   help me get him into the car ja-
cobi directed and raising the uncon-
scious man between them the two lifted
him tenderly into the automobile

   he must be intoxicated harris
muttered as he helped make the stran-
ger as comfortable as possible

   not at all jacobi broke in quick-
ly  that is just what i thought at
first but there is no trace of liquor in
his breath i cannot understand it but
go ahead now

  at that instant the injured man

roused up and after a deep groan
burst out dont strike me again
then he suddenly sat erect and
grabbed at jacobi

   here harris help me the restau-
rant-owner called as the chauffeur was
about to replace the lamp then he
attempted to pacify the stranger

 there my man we are your friends
and want to take you to a doctor

  the others hands dropped limply to
his sides and in the dim glimmer of
the street-lamp jacobi could see he was
staring directly at him

   you are injured he continued
soothingly  but i will get medical aid
as quickly as possible my driver did
not see you in the darkness and ran
over you but i hope and pray you are
not hurt seriously

  the other sank back upon the cush-
ions

   i remember all now he said al-
most under his breath  are you a res-
taurant-owner  

   this question took jacobi by surprise
but he replied yes-why 

   then you are the man they wanted
this puzzled the other more than
ever and leaning closer to catch the
almost inaudible statements of the in-
jured man he said  i do not under-
stand

   i know now was the response

 they wanted you-and got me

   jacobi realized the futility of secur
ing any information from the man
whose mind he now believed to be wan-
dering leaning out of the car toward
harris who stood alongside he or-
dered   go ahead but drive carefully
avoiding any jar ill take him to my
home

   no not that the stranger burst
out  take me to my home

  the car was already under way and
the driver leaned back to catch any di-
rection he might give

  and where is -that jacobi in-
quired

   beaumont-on this same road

    better let me take you to my house
the restaurant proprietor urged  i live
in haledon-only two miles farther than
beaumont then ill summon my own
doctor-

 no i want mine the stranger in-
jacobis juggernaut



terrupted  ill tell you when we get
there

  a sharp cry escaped him

   oh he moaned  my head and
side pain me so

  for a minute no one spoke then the
injured one added you must be the
man they were after

what do you mean jacobi asked
the car was slowly proceeding north-
ward and an occasional darkened house
disclosed the fact that they were ap-
proaching a town

   i can tell you-in a few words
the stranger spoke with great effort
 i had spent the evening-at a friends
-about three miles down the road the
last trolley - was missed - and i was
forced to walk that spot-where you
found me - i approached and heard
voices i stopped-and listened- oh
my side  he moaned and paused as if
in great pain

   ill have you at a doctor pretty
soon now jacobi told him

   there were three men the stran-
ger continued  i soon learned they
were there-to hold-up and rob-a res-
taurant-owner in new york-who lived
in haledon

  yes jacobi broke in now all ex-
citement	
just then-i stepped on a dry twig
before i knew it-they were upon me
-and struck me down by repeated blows
on the head i remember nothing more
-until i found myself here

 then you saved me- jacobi
stopped abruptly and there was an
added warmth in his tone as he con-
tinued   try to bear the pain a short
while longer

  the stranger leaned forward and
stared into the gloom outside the car

   my house-you are near it its on
the next corner he murmured

  if you wish to be taken there ja-
cobi rejoined  i will leave you but

i	insist upon sending a doctor to you
 there is one in our house the
stranger returned still gazing intently
out of the car  its a boarding-house
-and-there it is now

  he pointed to a large dwelling a short
distance ahead

   pull in harris was the order and
the car drew up close to the curb

  what is your name jacobi in-
quired as the machine came to a stand-
still

   bickel was the reply

   ring the bell harris and get some
one out here

  as the chauffeur started for the stoop
the injured man called after him  ask
them to get dr zabriskie to come down
ask for him

  it was some moments after harris
had rung the bell when a light appeared
in a room  the second floor and the
raised window disclosed a woman

  who is there she inquired

   please tell dr zabriskie to come
downtejacobi called mr bickel has
met with an accident-

  the head quickly disappeared and a
moment later a man- in a dressing-gown
and slippers appeared at the front door
he volunteered the information that lie
was dr zabriskie

  in response to jacobis call he fol-
lowed harris to the machine and upon 
being told very briefly of the accident
directed that the injured man be helped
to his room

  the chauffeur and his employer
made a seat by grasping the crossed
hands of each other and carried the
sufferer into the house and up-stairs the
doctor following them closely

  as the victim of the highwaymen was
laid tenderly upon his bed jacobi and
harris stepped back to allow the physi-
cian to determine the extent of bickels
injuries

  what happened mr bickel the
surgeon queried while taking his pulse

   i was struck on the head was the
reply  and then run over-by an auto-
mobile

  where do you feel pain the doc-
tor went on while he felt the others
head carefully

   my head-and side was the groan-
ing reply

  zabriskie unbuttoned the mans coat
and shirt and went over bickels chest
with both hands while jacobi and his
chauffeur awaited anxiously the result
of the examination

   three ribs fractured - one com-
pound the surgeon announced without
looking up  and a bad one too he
added in a tone that plainly showed the


the argosy

seriousness of the accident  it may
have punctured the lung although i am
not certain

  and his head jacobi queried
earnestly

   cant tell yet whether his skull is
fractured or not

   this is a very serious matter doc-
tor jacobi ventured after some hesita-
tion   and i feel doubly responsible
for mr bickels condition in the first
place his getting what was intended for
me may have saved my life and in the
second place his broken ribs were caused
by my machine passing over him i owe
him a debt i can never repay and as
you seem to be a friend of hisj i im-
plore you to give him every attention in
your power i am responsible for the
bill and if necessary do not leave his
side for an instant here is a hundred
dollars on account

  he handed the other some bills which
he had taken from his pocket

   i will do all in my power the doc-
tor declared with emphasis  and thank
you for your confidence in me and for
these

  he nodded toward the bills which he
slipped into a wallet

   bickel and i are the best of friends
and i tell you thisll be a blow to him
 it would be a blow to any one
jacobi returned

   but particularly to him the doc-
tor said  he has been out of work
for some time and was promised a po-
sition for next monday i fear it will
be a great many mondays before he can
think of going to business

  the restaurant-owner drew the physi-
cian to the far side of the room where
they held a brief whispered conversa-
tion at the conclusion of which the two
men approached the bed again

   mr bickel jacobi began  perhaps
you do not realize just what you have
done for me to-night had it not been
for you i might be in the same condition
as yourself-or more likely in a much
worse one and as the doctor has just
informed me you will be unable just
now to accept the position that is
offered to you i wish to make you a
present-

  the man on the bed raised his hand
in silent protest

   but i insist upon it jacobi con-
tinued  i have already assured dr
zabriskie that all his charges will be
paid by me and i have advanced him
one hundred dollars on account but
now for yourself

  he drew out his clieck-book and
hastily filling one out handed it to the
injured man  this is a slight token
of my gratitude to you he added

  bickel took it in a dazed sort of way
and glanced at the slip of paper
quickly

   i cant accept this he said slowly
and let it flutter to the floor

  the physician drew the restaurant
owner from the bedside again

   i will attend to it mr jacobi he
said  and it will be a godsend to him
knowing him as i do i am fully aware
of his financial condition and a few dol-
lars will tide him over for the present
or at least until he is able to be around
again landladies are like the tide he
added smilingly  they wait for no
man

  he stepped to the side of the bed and
picked up the check

   five thousand dollars  he ex-
claimed as his eyes fastened upon the
bit of paper  why its a small for-
tune to him

   and he deserves it j acobi declared
 i will leave the patient in your care
it is late-why its nearly two oclock-
so i must go spare no expense or
trouble to effect a speedy recovery i
will drop in to-morrow to inquire re-
garding his progress

  with a parting  good night jacobi
hurried from the room and down the
stairs to the street where harris having
realized some time before that his pres-
ence was not needed in the sick-room
was waiting

   its pretty tough on the poor fel-
low jacobi murmured as the car again
proceeded on its way to haledon

  but hell recover wont he the
chauffeur inquired

   i think so-or at least i hope so
was the reply  he seemed quite him-
self again although suffering acute pain
let us hope for the best anyway but i
think harris that you and i had a
pretty close call

  the chauffeur made no reply and
jacobis juggernaut



the ride continued in silence soon
ending as the heavy car ground noisily
over the pebbled driveway that led from
the highway to jacobis house

  he dismissed the chauffeur and hur-
ried to his rooms where he retired for
the night hoping for the rest he needed
but the events of the last few hours
weighed heavily upon him and sleep
would not come

  the very fact that he would fear to
take the rides his doctor had ordered
preyed upon his mind and at last forced
him to a decision-he would not let the
matter rest where it was but would
emply detectives to trace the highway-
men and bring them to justice

  with this decision came a determi-
nation to lose no time in acting upon it
he resolved to start upon the wprk at
daylight while such clues as there might
be would still be warm

  jacobi glanced at his watch-it lacked
five minutes of five

   by jove ill phone harf now-he
can be up here in an hour or so and
ill get him on the case immediately
he had had occasion to employ a de-
tective on two or three occasions and
being recommended to one named hart
had found him very satisfactory con-
sequently this man came to his mind
and he quickly determined to get in
communication with him knowing he
had a telephone in his residence

  jacobi threw about himself a dressing-
gown and descended to the library
where the telephone was located some
moments elapsed between the time he
gave the desired number to the operator
and the thick inquiry at the other end
well what do you want

  but although his voice betrayed the
fact that its owner had been suddenly
awakened by the ringing of the tele-
phone bell jacobi recognized it as be-
longing to the man he wanted

  this is mr jacobi he said i
am in haledon and wish you would
come here as quickly as possible

  the other was instantly alert and
ready to do as bidden

  he arrived in haledon in due course
jacobi met him at the station with the
car and the restaurant proprietor hur-
riedly recited the events of the past
night the detective listening intently

   thinking the place for clues would
naturally be the spot where the affair
happened jacobi added  i came down
to take you there

   it seems a peculiar case the detec-
tive replied  but let us start for the
spot my work begins there

  yes go ahead harris jacobi di-
rected  do you think you can locate
the exact place

   yes sir was the reply as the car
moved off

  hart inquired into every detail from
the time of the accident until jacobi had
left the bedside of the injured man

   as far as i can make out at present
mr jacobi he said slowly you have
had a very narrow escape

   so i reasoned the other agreed
hart then turned his attention to the
chauffeur

   stop just this side of the spot if
you can remember the exact location
there may be some clue that might be
destroyed if we ran over the spot

  it is just ahead there-where the
road turns sharply harris explained

   then stop here hart directed
 fortunately the drizzle of last night
was not heavy enough to destroy foot-
prints if there were any left in the soft
dirt let us get out here and walk care-
fully keep a sharp lookout

  the three men alighted from the car
and slowly made their way to the spot
indicated by the chauffeur easily recog-
nizable by the footprints in the soft
dirt

  hart stared hard at these for some
seconds then remarked  there are
plenty of tracks here but as they do
not lead into the bushes at the side i
judge they are your own as near as
i can make out the highwaymen must
have kept in the hard road when they
left this spot-there are nd signs that
they made their escape by cutting across
country not right here at any rate
you passed no one on the road did
you 

   not that i noticed jacobi re-
plied did you harris

   no sir

  suddenly harts eyes fastened upon
something about ten feet from where
they stood and he hurried in that di-
rection


the argosy

  whats this he queried as the
other two men followed behind him

  there in the soft soil were two
parallel marks as if something heavy
had been dragged toward the bushes at
the side of the road

  hart followed the strange marks and
stepped into the wet bush where they
disappeared the others watching him
closely he stooped down for a few
moments then raised his head and beck-
oned

  as jacobi neared his side he pointed
to an object half hidden by the under-
growth and that gentleman gavea start
of surprise as he saw before him what
appeared at first glance to be the body
of a man

  the detective noted his look and re-
assured him

   no need to be shocked-its only
a dummy he said

  the restaurant owner leaned over and
peered closer at the thing and when he
saw it was only some straw-filled cloth-
ing he queried blankly what does
this mean

   i have my own theory hart re-
plied vaguely perhaps  am wrong
but my advice is to take me to the in-
jured man as quickly as possible

   but what is your theory 

  whether it was that the detective
did not consider his theory had secure
enough foundation he was not ready to
communicate to his employer but re-
plied simply  take me to the man
but do not introduce me as a detective
 but we cannot call upon a sick man
at this hour the other protested

   yes we can under these circum-
stances hart insisted

   very well the case is in your
hands but jacobis tone showed plainly
his reluctance to follow the advice

  the three men returned to the car
and were soon on their way to beaumont
and the injured man

what can i say and who are you
supposed to be jacobi inquired
 and perhaps the man will be asleep-
 in that case his rest will be dis-
turbed hart interrupted

   i cannot do that after what has
happened

   and it is for just that reason that
vou will do it when i tell you-

   here is the house jacobi inter-
rupted as the car came to a halt

 then let us go up immediately
there was a positiveness in the de-
tectives tone that brooked no objection
and reluctantly jacobi followed him up
the steps

  in answer to his ring of the bell a
domestic came to the door

   is mr - he began then turned
to the restaurant owner  what is his
name 

    bickel

  yes is mr bickel in

   yes sir because  heard him in his
room as i came by it a few moments
ago

   i guess it was dr zabriskie jacobi
broke in  he probably stayed up with
him all night

   probably hart repeated quietly
then addressing the girl he directed
take us to his room do not an-
nounce us-take us right up

  the two men trailed after the maid
and paused before the door she indi-
cated without a word hart turned the
knob quickly and threw open the door

  i beg your pardon i guess i got
in the wrong room he said to the men
whose backs were turned to him and
who were busily packing a grip

  at the sound of his voice they faced
about suddenly to see before them a
stranger and the restaurant owner the
countenances of each took on a peculiar
expression as they stood there apparent-
ly too surprised to move or speak

  hart crossed the threshold and with-
out taking his eyes from the two men
inquired of jacobi which is the in-
jured man

   that-one  was the reply which
came with a gasp of astonishment be-
tween each word

   pretty well looking man to have
been knocked senseless by highwaymen
and then run over by an automobile
i should say hart remarked

   but-but- bickel began

   there are no  buts  about it hart
broke in  i see through your game
 mr hart jacobi burst out  i
protest

   the case is in my hands now sir
the detective declared firmly turning
to the two men he continued as he dis-
jacobis juggernaut



closed his shield  i am a detective
and i want you

   this matter has gone too far ja-
cobi cried  mr bickel i assure
you-

   let me talk hart interrupted
cant you see their game

  dr zabriskie fumbled in his pocket
and drew out the check which the res-
taurant owner had presented to the in-
jured man and his hand trembled as
he grimly held it out toward the detec-
tive

   take it-we are leaving town by
the first train

  hart took the piece of paper

   when you leave town you come with
me he announced firmly  will you
prosecute them mr jacobi

   i cannot see-

   why you didnt run over this man
the other said impatiently  it was a
dummy which he dragged into the
bushes when he saw you stop and then
lay down in the road himself there
were no highwaymen waiting for you
either it was all in the game and
they knew that youd fall for it any
one in the same position would nat-
urally do so

  a light of understanding broke over
jacobis face

   i cant believe it

   but  can and this dr zabriskie is
no more a doctor than i am he was the
other man in the affair will you pros-
ecute now

  a smile of relief broke over jacobis
countenance as he replied no i am
too delighted to know that i have not
injured a man who was supposedly the
cause of saving my life no ill not
prosecute now that i have the check
back

  hart gave vent to a grunt of disgust
 well ill be darned  he muttered
then he turned to the two men

 come on now and well see that
you get out of town pay your bill-
 we did that a few moments ago
bickel said as he shot a furtive glance
at the man he had attempted to defraud

   then come on-well take you to
the station hart added

  the four men descended to the wait-
ing auto and harriss surprise was
noticeable as he saw them enter the
machine

   to the station jacobi ordered

  not a word was spoken during the
short ride and there was no parting
greeting as the two strangers clambered
out at the railroad-depot and stood on
the platform awaiting the train

   you ought to send them up hart
declared as he lingered beside the car
by jove how about the hundred you
thought you were paying to a doctor
ill get that too

  but jacobi detained him

  no let them keep it its worth
that to have my mind relieved-to know
my machine did not break four or five
of a mans ribs

  a heavy train was rumbling into the
station and hart started toward it with
the pair in front of him

   ill see them to new york anyway
good day sir

  harris turned to his employer
what does it mean sir

  jacobi smiled grimly

   nothing much except that you
didnt run over that man bickel re-
lieve your mind on that score take
me home now and ill tell you all about
it on the way to new york this after-
noon

    faithfulness

 they vowed eternal constancy-
 the youth and maiden shy
 through time and through eternity
 their love should never die

 but fate in lifes uncertain whirl
 played havoc with their plan-

               author of  from flag to flag  on glorys trail with sealed lips etc

             a story of paris in the reign of terror with an american for
             its central figure and his sweetheart in the grip of powerful foes

        synopsis of chapters previously published

    accompanied by shadrach bemis an old ex-scout and trapper a young american
jack braith sets sail for france with the purpose of claiming the title and estates of his
late granduncle the vicomte de chevreuse he knows nothing of his french relatives
except of his cousin etienne de chevreuse a wild youth who is said to resemble him
greatly in looks on the voyage he meets and falls in love with mile elise de perier
who with her father is taken aboard from a sloop wrecked by a privateer after a narrow
escape from being kidnaped by the privateers mysterious captain

    arrived in paris where the revolution is raging braith bemis and de perier take
lodging at a small hotel in the rue st honore two weeks later mile de perier fis ab-
ducted by some unknown enemy but bemis succeeds jn tracking the cab in which she is
carried off to a convent in the suburbs under the guidance of bemis braith goes to the
place and demands to see the abbess her words of greeting leave him dumfounded with
amazement

chapter vi continued

a new mystery

whal the abbess said that so an-
noyed me was merely this

  citizen braith

how did she know my name

i peered forward through the half-
light to scan her pallid face indistinct-
ly as i could see it i was none the less
sure i had never before looked upon her

  citizen braith she repeated as i
 did not speak  you wished to speak
 with me  

  yes i made shift to reply pulling
 myself together and blurting out my
 message awkwardly enough  i wished
 to see you about mile de perier

she inclined her head but with 
surprise

  mile de perier is here   went on
  certainly citizeness perier is here
 she answered apparently astonished at
 my question

 mother i pleaded awkward in my
hopeless eagerness   have come for
her wont you let me take her away
i beg it of you her old father-

  let you take her away  echoed the
 abbess	a

	began april argosy

   yes back to her father mother
i do not ask why she-

  but citizen she interrupted itis
not necessary to entreat your order is
sufficient as you well know the citizen-
ess has been detained here only subject
to your wishes now that you are ready
to remove her there can be no obstacle
to her departure i hardly expected you
so soon but-

  i did not hear the rest of the sentence
the room seemed to whirl around me

  was i dreaming here i had come
prepared to beg threaten intrigue yet
lhad hoped little of my quest and at
my first word i found the door of my
wishes flung wide open

  surely of all the days many tangles
this was the most mystifying

  my first thought was that in the gloom
the abbess had mistaken me for another
but no she had called me by name
had said elise was at the convent await-
ing only my word of release mad and
impossible as it all seemed i was not
idiot enough to spoil my advantage by
prying into its reason

   i thank you mother i said as coolly
as i could  and if i may trouble you
to have mile de perier ready at once i
single copies  cents


the crimson harvest



will have a carriage sent for to take her
away

  the abbess bowed and was about to
quit the room when i interposed

   one moment may i ask that you
do not let her know it is i who arranged
her release 

   but-

   let her think it is the police or any
one you will i insisted  but i do
not wish my name to appear the car-
riage if i can find one at this hour will
be awaiting her in the courtyard in ten
minutes will you see that she is ready
by that time 

  coming upon the little boy on the
steps i handed him a gold coin and bade
him hurry oft to the nearest mews for
two fiacres and have them sent to the
convent with all speed then i joined
bemis at the gate

  to the old trapper i told the story
at its end he muttered confusedly
this aint a joke is it

   i dont know said i  my only
fear is that i may wake up before we get
to mile de periers home

   but what are the two carriages
for he queried as the cabs rumbled
up to the gate

   i want her love i replied  not
her gratitude if she knows i have saved
her from this place she may think she
owes me something you and i will get
into this second cab the abbess will
put her in the first i will give direc-
tions beforehand to both drivers one to
go straight to our hotel with her the
other-the one you and i take-to fol-
low close to guard her

   she need never know i dont eare
to pose as a rescuer especially after such
a tame rescue as this nor to have her
feel indebted to me she must care for
me for myself not for what ive done
for her

  which proved to be the most insane
plan of my life and one that was to lead
us all far closer to death than most men
are brought before their last hour

dismay

  it was late next morning when i
awoke and long i lay drowsily won-

dering why i felt so at peace with the
world then i remembered elise was
safe

  true to my plan bemis and i had not
made known our presence elise had
entered the cab in the convent courtyard
and had been driven straight to the
hotel we following in the second vehicle

  i had seen her alight and hurry into
the hotel and had noted in that brief
glimpse the stricken harassed look on
her sweet face small wonder after all
she had been through

  i had not broken in upon her meeting
with her father she would be weary
it was no time to intrude so i waited

  and now at dawn i awoke across
the room shadrach was snoring mightily
in the street outside i heard the rolling
of carts a shrill newsboys voice cut
the air with words whose frequency of
utterance had well-nigh robbed them of
their gruesome meaning

   list of the condemned list of
the condemned 

  for thus it was that the news-sheets
of the time made known to the public
the results of each previous days trials
and people read with bated breath

  none could say how soon his or her
own name might be emblazoned there
nor when the cockaded guard of the
committee of public safety might halt
at the door with the dread summons

   in the name of the republic of
france 

  that morning i called on laurier
the chevreuse advocate he had re-
turned from touraine the preceding
afternoon but i got slight benefit from
the visit old laurier declared himself
utterly at a loss

    for months i have been at work
on the case he said in doleful perplex-
ity  it seemed moderately simple at
first indeed i cannot say why it has
not remained so but at every turn some
new and unforeseen obstacle blocks my
way some legal quibble due to the
changed conditions or else a setback of
a clerical sort it seems as if some wily
foe were working in the dark against us
 you spoke in your letter i sug-
gested  of another claimant who had
vowed to fight my claim to the last
ditch can you tell me who he is and
where t may find him i may as well

the argosy

settle with him soon as late if there
is a duel to be fought-

    am not yet at liberty to give you
the information you ask he interposed
 you see i am the lawyer of the estate
not your personal advocate so i must
do justice alike to all legal claimants
personally as i wrote you i believe your
claim just and yourself the natural suc-
cessor but until i can fully establish
those facts and hear in full the preten-
sions of-

   i understand i broke in rising

  i knew well the dreary long-winded
technicalities of french law it could
not be hurried

   moreover he added  even though
you are proven the rightful wearer of
the title  vicomte de chevreuse it will
not only be an empty honor in these days
of equality but may even implicate you
as an aristocrat i speak unprofession-
ally of course hev finished nervously
 you see i-

   i know said i  yet i am minded
to claim the title for myself it means
nothing i am an american born and
bred and to america i shall return
when this business is at an end yet
thinking of elise and her father  i
wish to prove my right to the title none
the less as for the estates and the
money i shall need those for the same
cause i beg you will use all diligence
in my behalf

  when i reached the outer office
where shadrach was awaiting me i
found him doubled up on a high stool
poring over a shabby little book his
lips moving noiselessly his forehead
puckered it was not the first time i
had caught him thus engaged now
as always before at sight of me he
thrust the book into his deerskin blouse

  but he saw that i had noted his
action as we passed out into the street
he cleared his throat and remarked
with some nervousness

  know what i was doin

   no  answered  what 
instead of replying directly he drew
a long breath and then burst forth into
a jumble of fearsome sounds

   thar  he ended with sheepish
pride  hows hat

   is it a choctaw war-whoop   i
asked or-

  its french he retorted deeply
offended  an you pretend to know
the language aij cant even understand
it what i said was french for have
you the pen ink an paper of your
granthers wife   

   oho it was a french text-book
you were studying good for you
now say the sentence again a little
slower this time french people dont
talk quite so explosively

   a vvy-zoo-lay-ploom-i-  he
began pompously then with a rueful
sigh  the whole measly things
slipped me agin but ill git it some
time or other when you goin to call on
miss elise

  i consulted my watch

   it is nearly noon i answered
ill go as soon aswe reach the hotel
 you were silly not to take her home
from that convent place last night
shed likely a squealed  im yourn 
the minute she clapped eyes on you an
found it was you that let her out of
the convent

   ive told you once that i want her
love not her thanks i replied
 and-

   an ive told you twice youre fool-
ish troubles lible to come from that
breed of nonsense

  i laughed at him and ran up the
broad stairs of the hotel to the door of
the de perier suite to the answering
 entrez  i swung open the door and
entered the spacious old drawing-room

  elise and her father were seated near
the window deep in talk a glance
showed me that elise had been weeping
on her white face i read too that
harassed almost heart-broken look which
had so distressed me the night before

  at sight of me both father and
daughter sprang to their feet i hur-
ried forward eagerly then halted for
instead of the welcoming smile i had
looked to see de periers pale old eyes
were ablaze with wrath elise had
shrunk back at my advance as though
i had struck her

  and thus for an instant we three
stood it was de perier who broke the
silence

   it is well you have come monsieur
lie said in a voice shaking with rage
 though i scarce expected such effront-
the crimson harvest



ery it is a peace however with the
rest of your conduct

   m de perier i cried doubting
my own ears

  it is well he repeated for
you can hear from our own lips how
we regard such asyou -if-
mademoiselle  i exclaimed aghast
turning to elise  has your father gone
mad

  but she vouchsafed me no answer
her gentle eyes were full of a cold
scorn that had no place therein yet
behind it i seemed to read a sorrow
greater than her outward contempt

  i drew myself together facing de
perier again

   will you do me the honor to explain
sir   i asked stiffly

   hypocrisy will not help you now
he retorted  we know everything i
only grieve we did not know sooner
what do you mean on my soul
this is greek to me

   i mean snarled de perier  if i
were a younger man i should kill you
as i would kill a cur as it is leave our
rooms before i forget my own dignity
another will soon be here who will know
how to deal with you though it were
unbecoming a gentleman of france to
soil his hands on such canaille

  elise had crossed to where the sha-
king furious old man stood and laid an
appealing hand on his arm the touch
momentarily calmed him

   go  he repeated pointing again
to the door

  in reply i folded my arms and stood
stock-still

   i shall not go said i as quietly
as might be  until this absurd mis-
understanding is cleared up

   misunderstanding  he mocked bit-
terly  the  misunderstanding  has
been all ours monsieur it no longer
exists nor do you so far as concerns
us

  mademoiselle said i again ignor-
ing him i seem unable to obtain any
explanation from your father will you
do me the honor to tell me what this
all means

   i forbid you to address my daugh-
ter   quavered the irate de perier

   i have been honored by your ac-
quaintance mademoiselle and by your

fathers i went on unheeding  to
the best of my knowledge i have done
nothing to forfeit that honor yret to-
day-

  elise checked again an outbreak of
de periers rage speaking with an ef-
fort yet in a curiously dead calm voice
she turned to her father

   it would be better to end this it
cannot but be painful to us all tell
m braith why we forbid him our rooms
father as briefly as you can

   m braith said the old man
quieter now and bowing acquiescence to
his daughters request  i welcomed your
acquaintance because i believed you a
gentleman i allowed you to meet and
converse freely with my daughter under
the same impression how have you
requited us by causing my daughters
arrest as a political suspect by having
her spirited away from me and placed
in the convent of our lady of mont-
martre by-

    it is a lie  i shouted forgetting
in my amaze to choose more respectful
language toward a man so much my
senior  who tells so dastardly a false-
hood of me it is absurd as well as
false i-

   your acting is excellent monsieur
sneered de perier  but it will not serve
you know best why you did this thing
at first i myself was at a loss for a
motive to it but this very day the clue
has unexpectedly come into my hands

i understand now only too well why
you should wish my daughter out of
the way have you heard enough if
so go 

   i have heard no word of truth i
replied dizzy with the whole bewildering
affair  nor anything i can understand
you are actually mad enough to claim
it was  who had mile de perier kid-
naped i demand to know your author-
ity for so ridiculous a-

     am his authority interposed elise

   you

   i went to the fiacre to meet my
father i was hurried into it and the
driver started then  found it was
not my father but a strange man beside
me on the seat the curtains were down

i could not see his face i was hurried
to the convent there they were await-
ing me


the argosy

    i was led to a cell by two lay-sisters
put no word of explanation was offered
some hours later-long after dark-i
was ordered to go to the abbesss room
the police had ordered me set free

  i remembered angrily the tale i had
bade the abbess tell as explanation
elise went 

   as the abbess was telling me of my
release she was called from the room
for a moment on the table lay several
open papers one was a  icttre de
cachet consigning me to the convent

 on request of citizen j ohn braith
american and for such term as he shall
designate it was signed by fouquier-
tinville the public prosecutor and
countersigned by the president of the-
my name mine i found voice
to gasp

 your name she repeated miserably
 i still did not believe when the
abbess returned i showed her the paper
and demanded to know what it meant
 and she-

    she confirmed it i still refused to
believe then she showed me the sig-
nature john braith american at the
bottom of my commitment and-and
described you accurately she said you
had been at the convent that very day
naturally enough the abbess could
describe me she had at the time
parted from me not ten minutes before
but even at that i could make nothing
of it all

  why should a daughter of the church
lie about such a thing no she had
told doubtless what she deemed the
truth also she had called me by name
on first sight

  oh there was no getting to the bot-
tom of the wretched complication nor
had i just then the heart to try to solve
it all i wanted was to set myself
straight in elises eyes

    well sir observed de perier  are
you satisfied

  no i declared

    you still persist in-

   in declaring my innocence i do
not understand this mystery but i give
you my word-

   the word of an american 

  there was a slur in the retort that
maddened me

  yes of an american i flashed

back of a race that has yet to be
charged with the petty dishonesties and
lies that are dragging your old-world
nations to their fall you use the term
 american  as an insult sieur de perier
 wear it as an honor

   an honor on which your country
is doubtless to be complimented he
laughed contemptuously  but this has
little to do with the matter in hand
you have-

   i have heard you patiently and i
deny the charges all i ask is the
chance to prove them false

  de perier shrugged his shoulders in
disgust and once again pointed door-
ward but elise now spoke her lovely
face had softened i knew she was loath
to disbelieve pie and that my vehemence
had had some slight effect on her heart

   m braith she said  i would
rather cut off my own hand than that
you should have been thus treated if you
do not deserve it if that is so both
i and my father will make all the
amends that mortals can you must not
blame us nor think we decided over-
hastily surely the proof stands clear
can you refute it  

   he can overwhelm us with lies 
cried de perier before i could speak
if he has real proof let him produce
it

   you have doubted my word mon-
sieur said i  among gentlemen a
sacred word of honor is-

   my father has doubted your word
admitted elise intervening between de
perier and myself  but he was indig-
nant at what he thought were my
wrongs when he is calmer he will
agree with me in accepting it i do not
ask for proofs m braith if you will
give me your solemn word of honor-
 gladly  i exclaimed my heart
throbbing with joy at her trust and its
triumph over such fearfully condemning
appearances most gladly i-

   your word of honor she continued
 that the abbess was mistaken in think-
ing you visited the convent and talked
with her yesterday-

  my changed face must have warned
her for she stopped and her own pale
cheek grew whiter her big gray eyes
were luminous with unspoken pleadings
what could i do
the crimson harvest



  yes i know it would have been the
part of sanity to say  i went there
to save you but even if i could have
made her believe the story of my strange
interview with the abbess - which my
own common sense scarce permitted me
to believe-i was still all the more re-
solved not to come to her with an appeal
for thanks when what i craved was her
unbiased love

  and stubborn pride too flew to the
aid of this resolve

  her father had insulted me she her-
self had at first doubted me-though her
strongest reason for that doubt i was
destined not to know until many months
later-and in face of all this how could
i pose melodramatically as her pre-
server it was out of the question
and at best de perier would never
credit my version of the scene at the
convent no there was no way out
of it

  de perier who had moved to the win-
dow as though disclaiming any share
in his daughters compassionate weak-
ness now looked around in some in-
terest he had noted elises pause and
like her read my face

   you heard my daughters question
he rasped  did you or did you not
go to the convent of our lady of mont-
martre yesterday

  i made no reply

   did you talk there with the abbess
in reference to my daughters captiv-
ity

  i did not answer

  come come sir the old man
growled  a moment back you were
eager enough to be put upon your so-
called  word of honor yet now that
we stoop to question you you are dumb
surely there is not so much  honor  in
that same  word  as to choke back all
your speech can you find no lies to
those two simple queries did you go
to the convent and did you talk to the
abbess

   my answer to both questions i
returned hopelessly is-yes

  a little gasp from elise and an ironic
chuckle from her father then the girl
sank down and buried her face in her
hands there was that in her crushed
attitude which went like a knife to my
heart

   i went there i asserted again
 and i talked to the abbess but it
was not to-

  a jeering laugh from the old man
cut me short

   so the supply of falsehoods has not
yet run out after all  he remarked
 have you still others 

   i have spoken the truth i urged
casting sense to the winds along with
hope  and any man with a brain should
know it what object could i have had
in the kidnaping of your daughter let
me tell you one more  falsehood to
prove what i say-or to clinch the rest
m de perier  love your daughter i
had hoped to come to you rich and
titled to claim her hand why should

i	then have spirited her away i love
her and-

  the old mans sardonic humor gave
place in a breath to senile fury at my
presumption

   go  he shrieked springing un-
steadily at me cane aloft

  down came the slender walking-stick
across my unguarded face feeble as
was the arm that dealt it the blow was
none the less infuriating

  and then  did the bravest deed of
my life i looked de perier in the eyes
-scarce noting elises cry of horror
and her hurried rush between us-bowed
in silence to both father and daughter
turned on my heel and left the room

  my whole being throbbed and burned
ii accord with the sting of the welt
across my face i could not think save
through a mist of red

  i had been struck like a street-beggar
-and in the presence of-a woman the
woman i loved i had been struck and
i had been brave enough not to resent it

  i left the hotel looking not to right
or left straight onward i went heed-
less of distance direction or time

 through deserted byways and
through busy throngs i hurried at un-
checked pace more than one man was
rudely jostled in my unswerving prog-
ress through the more frequented thor-
oughfares

  at such times i came out of my mad
daze long enough to hope vaguely that
one of the persons thus hustled might
take umbrage and pick a quarrel with
me


the argosy

  an angry man is not unlike a child
a man furious as i and at the same
time so sorely perplexed and heart-
broken is perhaps little better than an
imbecile and always that reddening
welt on my face burned and stung it
seemed to me that the mark must blaze
out from my countenance and give
notice to all

   here is the man who was caned-
beaten like a dog-and who did not re-
sent it 

  for many hours this insanity of mine
must have waged till at last by sheer
fatigue and lapse of time it smoldered
down into something like normal men-
tality and i came to myself wondering
at first where i was

  dusk had fallen i was in the mont-
martre district i must have wandered
in a half-circle covering many miles
yet pausing at length only a mile or
two from my starting-point

  montmartre in those days as later
avas the home of workmen poor students
riffraff cafe politicians and the  red 
political societies

  not the safest place on earth after
nightfall but at that era of agita-
tion it was the home-ground of the
most rabid of all the revolutionary
factions

  i loosened my small sword in its
sheath looked about me to fix my loca-
tion and walking in midstreet beyotjd
the shadows of the rickerty houses
turned my steps homeward

  i was passing a cafe when its door
was flung open and one or two men
started out i crossed the broad path
of light from within one of the men
lurched accidentally against me in emer-
ging from the brightly illuminated in-
terior into the dusk of the street

  the impact jarred him and he gave
vent to his feelings in one of those pe-
culiarly offensive epithets for which the
paris pot-house politician is so justly
celebrated

  at another time i might have let it
pass but now my nerves raw up
flared my temper catching the fel-
low suddenly by the shoulder i shook
him as a puppy might shake a rag and
then threw him violently against the
wall

  he gathered himself together with a

volley of lurid curses pulled out an
ugly short knife and sprang toward me

chapter viii

a nocturnal adventure

  now i had done an asinine thing i
had forced a fight in a district where
human life was held even cheaper than
in the revolutionary courts of the day

  also my opponent was no doubt a
member of one of the countless mont-
martre clubs or gangs and had probably
a score of friends within easy call more
than willing to take up their comrades
quarrel i would be extremely lucky to
escape alive

  still having brought on the trouble i
would not adopt the one sane course left
to me namely take to my heels i stood
my ground half drawing my sword as
my assailant bounded forward then an
odd thing happened

  the fellow halted - almost as it
seemed in mid-leap his truculent man-
ner underwent a swift change

   pardon citizen he said in brutal
attempt at civility  may i inquire your
name 

   my name is braith i replied sur-
prised

citizen john braith-american
with a queer inflection on the last word

   yes

  and i made as though to pass on

   one moment he ordered barring
my way knife still gripped

  lie blew four peculiarly modulated
notes on a whistle he liad snatched out
of a pocket with his free hand while i
was still wondering at the action and in
doubt as to whether to thrust him to one
side or to remain where i was a half-
dozen men ran out of the cafe

   we are in luck  cried the man who
had summoned them and i am glad
the meeting was still on in there it
would have been a pity to let such prey
escape and in my hurry i was nigh
to choosing for my own meat  what
lawfully belongs to you all citizens
brothers of the montmartre branch 
he went on oratorically  permit me to
present an honored guest jack braith-
american 

i had scarce opportunity to note again
the crimson harvest



that inflection on the word  american
for at his speech the half-dozen closed
around me

  a little crowd had already collected
in the dim street the cafe door had
swung shut and we were almost in dark-
ness

  i made as though to draw my sword
two hands from behind pinioned my
arms i wrenched myself free but not
before another had seized my sword and
pulled it from the scabbard and out of
my reach

  another patriot carried away by zeal
threw himself upon me my fist met his
jaw and he collapsed in the muddy
roadway

  but what can one man do against
six i am no hero of drury lane melo-
drama i struck out in all my strength
and more than one went down before
my blows while others reeled back
bruised and bleeding into the crowd

  yet the struggle was short others
had joined the first comers soon i was
overpowered by sheer force of numbers
and my arms were pinioned

   so  exclaimed the man who had
summoned the rest  thats settled
shall we carry him inside for his trial
or dispense wholly with the farce and
march straight to the seine

  what does this mean i panted
still vainly struggling  if you are
pickpockets-

  pickpockets echoed the spokes-
man in high contempt  citizen braith
we are as incorruptible as your beloved
friend and patron maximilien robes-
pierre-whom may the guillotine feed
upon 

   amen   chorused other voices from
the darkness

   a bas robespierre  screamed a
fishwife in the crowd

  the rabble took up the cry clearly
the  incorruptible  was not popular
here and i for some reason was evi-
dently supposed to be one of his sup-
porters

  yell a bas robespierre citizen
braith suggested my first acquaintance
 and we may make your end less pain-
ful

  the idea appealed to the crowd and
a laugh arose

  a bas robespierre  by all means

     a

if you like i retorted as unconcernedly
as might be  it is all one to me 

   see  commented the man  his
own lieutenants cannot be loyal to the
 incorruptible ill wager that even
couthon or st just would also have-
 be still  ordered a deeper voice
from the other side of the little circle
 that is not citizen braiths voice i
ought to know bring a torch some
one

  a flambeau was brought from a near-
by huckster-stall the deep-voiced man
-who was taller and better dressed than
his colleagues and seemed in authority
-thrust it in front of my face

   there is some mistake here he an-
nounced presently  this is not braith
duval youve made another of your
stupid absinthe-bred blunders

   it is braith insisted the man with
the knife  he-

    ought to know interrupted the
other  it is not he or any one close
to robespierre

  you are right citizen spoke up
another  this is not braith ive
seen him a hundred times

   well cheerfully observed the man
called duval  why not kill him any-
how on general principles it will be
symbolic like burning braith in effigy
what do you say brothers

  another laugh went up at the grue-
some pleasantry but the leader inter-
vened sharply

   are we patriots or are we street-
assassins 

  personally i thought the two might
amount to much the same

   a mistake has been made here lie
added turning to me and offering me
my sword liilt foremost lie cut short
the wrangle by saying

   citizen pray accept our apologies
ho there jive the citizen room to
pass on his way good night 

  dazed my brain awhirl i returned
his bow took the proffered sword and
passed through the sullenly parted
throng out into the silence of the night
beyond

  as a man in a dream i walked my
wonder is that i did not in my absorp-
tion fall victim to the first footpad

  within the past thirty hours i had
first been saved from a duel because i


the argosy

was mistaken by ill light and other ob-
structions for a friend of robespierres
next  had been able to rescue elise
from the convent simply because my
name was braith now  had been
saved from nocturnal death because ap-
parently my name was not braith

  was ever mortal man in such another
snarl was there any head or tail to
the absurd impossible situation

  i had at first thought robespierre
mistook me for one of his friends the
same supposition would account for his
enemies assault on me to-night

  but the name  braith  why should
it secure me the privileges of the con-
vent-prison and why should the state-
ment that it was not my cognomen snatch
me from death at the hands of the mont-
martre club why

  oh it was all beyond me to dwell
on it longer i felt was like to drive
me mad

   but one thing at least my montmartre
adventure had accomplished it had
lifted me out of my despondent rage
against fate and circumstances in gen-
eral and de perier in particular i saw
that situation now at a better perspec-
tive and with saner eyes

  i had played the fool that morning
instead of insisting on going over the
whole misunderstanding quietly and log-
ically with elise and her father-driving
with de perier if necessary to the con-
vent itself for confirmation of my story
-what had i done i had blazed out
like any drunken soldier seeking by
frantic assertion to batter down a gate
of disbelief that only common sense
could unbar i had bellowed where i
should have argued

  as a result i had crushed elises
dawning faith in my innocence and i
had subjected myself to a blow from
a man too old to give satisfaction well
what was done might even yet be un-
done

  i put my pride and anger behind me-
or rather both were overwhelmed by
my greater love-and decided then and
there to humiliate myself by seeking
out elise and making one more appeal
to her not for belief this time but for
a fair chance to prove myself guiltless

  if she would grant me such chance
i was prepared to seize this baffling

mystery by the throat and-at cost of
life if need be-unveil it

  i reached the hotel full of my new
resolve passing the door of the de
perier suite on my way to my own room

i saw a line of light below the thresh-
old and heard voices within

  now that i had fought down my
pride i was minded not to let a night
pass before putting my new resolution
to the touch i rapped lightly-for the
hour was late-at the drawing-room door
of the suite then i pulled myself to-
gether determined not to let any rebuff
of de periers turn me from my pur-
pose or ruffle my wretched temper

  no reply came to my soft knock the
voices within the apartment drowning
it so i rapped again this time harder

  the door though i had not noted the
fact was on the latch the impact of
my hand swung it wide it was ill-hung
and its sill warped or so light a pres-
sure would scarce have opened it the
hotel and its equipment were old and
not in best repair

  as it was i found myself standing
on the threshold looking into the bril-
liantly lighted room whose occupants-
grouped at the opposite side and talking
-had not heard even my second and
louder knock

  dazzled by the sudden glare of light
after the dark  stood blinking on the
threshold trying to adjust my eyes to
the light and with my lips parted to
apologize for having seemingly flung
open the door unbidden

  but though my mouth remained open
no words came i stood like the spec-
tator at a stage-play gazing speechless
upon a scene being enacted at the far
end of the long room

my crowning act of folly

  a table was spread whereon lay tlie
remnants of a light supper at one end
of it sat m de perier leaning back with
a complacent smile on his withered old
lips his pale eyes were fixed affec-
tionately on two people who had appar-
ently just risen from the board

   one of these was elise still pale but
with a happy light in her glorious gray
the crimson harvest



eyes the other was a man-tall
young handsome - in traveling dress
on a chair near by lay his cloak hat
and sword

  the man with one arm supported
elise whose head rested on his shoul-
der this was what had caught my eye
and held me dumb

  as i looked she was saying

   good night then clieri and sleep
well a bridegroom should not look
haggard on his wedding-day

  if the sight of your dear face does
not give me sweet dreams nothing will
replied the stranger stooping and kiss-
ing her  so i- sacre who is this 
he broke off catching sight of me

  with a little cry elise released her-
self from his arm and whirled about
fear in her eyes de perier too sprang
shakily from his seat with a guttural cry

  the eyes of all three were fixed upon
me in the strangers i read only sur-
prise  in elises a fear so intense that
it actually hurt me in de periers a
senile fury

   what do you wish   asked the new-
comer curtly

 nothing-now i answered my
voice sounding hoarse and strange even
to my own ears

  it was the truth i had no further
object in being there i had just seen
that which struck me to the heart as all
the horrors of the reign of terror had
failed to do for in the scene i had
witnessed no great acumen was needed
to show me my life-liopes lay dead

  elise was betrothed was evidently-
from her wrords - about to become a
bride i am glad to recall that even
then i did not blame her for her earlier
kindly treatment of myself in none of
it now that i reviewed our happy talk
together had she given me actual en-
couragement

  i had mor than once hinted of my
own great love but she had not co-
quetted with me nor offered anything
that i could honestly term encourage-
ment

  yet i marveled that in our weeks of
close acquaintanceship in paris i had
never before set eyes on this fiance of
hers had he but just arrived from a
distance whoever he might be and
from wherever he might have come i

could see his suit was not only favored
by the girl but by her father as well

  in france fathers do not sit smiling
by while their daughters are kissed by
men whose attentions are unwelcome to
the family elise had told me she was
an only child this embrace i had be-
held could not therefore be fraternal
no there was but one explanation
and that the simplest and the future
stretched out before me dreary and
barren as a rainy sea

  all at once  felt very old and very
weary

  hence as i answered the strangers
brusk query i bowed and was stepping
back through the doorway when de
perier found his tongue

  nothing he queried fiercely echo-
ing my word  it seems you add to
your other accomplishments the gentle
art of spying m braith

  i did not answer indeecj i scarce
heeded nothing mattered now i was
still withdrawing when at sound of my
name the other man sprang forward to
bar the exit

braith he cried is this the
scoundrel of whom you told me sir 
 yes answered de perier  the
cur whom i caned this morning and
who-

   monsicurexclaimed the stranger
 you shall not leave this room before
giving me full satisfaction for your gross
insult to mile de perier you shall
be taught that it is one thing to kidnap
a young lady whose only protector is
old and feeble and quite another to
answer for that insult to a stronger
man

   hush maurice  whispered elise
in alarm  the door is still open any
one passing through the corridor might
hear or see you for my sake be pru-
dent remember it is death if-

  if this canaille leaves the room
alive replied the man but in a more
guarded tone as old de perier moved
by sudden caution shuffled across and
closed and bolted the door near which
i still stood if he escapes i have
no doubt he will tell the authorities of
my presence in paris but i do not
intend that he shall escape both on
your account elise and on my own
i have much to live for just at present


the argosy

  but elise had not heeded the latter
part of his speech she was advancing
toward me her hands outstretched her
eyes big with appeal

  monsieur she said brokenly we
are in your power why should you
persecute us if you really came here
to-night to spy upon the comte de
grieux  implore you to give up your
wicked plan he has not harmed you
he has harmed no one he was pro-
scribed as you know and fled to brus-
sels at risk of his life he has crept
back here by stealth but  on my
honor for no evil purpose no plot
against france oh have mercy on-

  stop   i broke in

  this agonized pleading for the man
she loved was more than i could bear

   stop  i repeated  mademoi-
selle you are humiliating yourself to
no purpose i-

  oh she gasped shrinking back
in misunderstanding of my words and
clasping her white little hands in en-
treaty  but for-

   there has been enough of this
elise  interposed de grieux putting
her behind him and advancing on me
 this is my affair not yours i-

  but i was not minded to add one
more blunder to the long score i thrust
the count aside with no great gentle-
ness and again confronted her

   mademoiselle i exclaimed  when
this refugee friend of yours interrupted
me i was about to say you were pleading
to no purpose-simply because i had no
idea before i entered this room that
the comte de grieux was here or even
that he was in existence after i leave
this room-which m le comte i shall
do at my own pleasure and unchecked
by you or any other man-after i leave
this room no one shall know from me
that m de perier is putting his neck in
peril by harboring a proscribed aristo-
crat of all this i give you most solemn
assurance which i beg you to believe
whether or not the others choose to be-
lieve me i care not in the least

   oh thank you  she exclaimed in
relief  i do believe you and i-

   but i do not croaked old de pe-
rier  this man is a spy moreover
he has influence with the riffraff that
calls jtself the french government

otherwise he could not have obtained
order for elises imprisonment in the
convent if he is allowed to leave
here-

  he shall not be returned de
grieux  rest assured of that sir
as for his being a spy and the chances
that he may denounce me i neither know
nor care but for his behavior yester-
day toward elise his life shall answer
stand back from that door 

  for i had already returned to it and
my fingers were on the bolt i now
turned slowly to face him

   my young friend i observed calm-
ly  i had the honor a few minutes ago
to tell you i should leave this room at
my own will i have not changed my
mind nor does the fact that you have
picked up your sword from that chair
deter me the least i do not wish to
fight you-for reasons which mile de
perier will understand better than your-
self

    we will leave mile de periers name
out of it if you please he retorted
stiffly  the matter lies between you
and me

  yet from the faint flush on her pale
face i saw that elise understood-she
knew i did not wish to fight de grieux
because he was the man she loved and
because i was averse to harming what
she held dear

   you will fare better with my cane
than with your sword maurice jeered
de perier  a thrashing is more in
the fellows line than a duel

  this too i endured without reply-
again for elises sake i turned once
more to the doorway

   well american asked de grieux
stepping sword drawn between me and
the threshold is it true will you
fight or must i kill you as i would any
other pestilent vermin

    i have told you said i keeping my-
self in hand with difficulty  that i do
not want to fight construe my motives
as you will

   there is but one way to construe a
cowards motives he answered

   be it so i said calmly though my
brain was ablaze at the unmerited affront

   though he resumed in sneering
banter  in your country i understand
cowardice is more a virtue than otherwise
the crimson harvest



the example if i remember aright was
set by your worthy leader general
washington

  i felt myself go white to the very lips
but i fought back my rage

   your ignorance of the greatest man
the century has produced said i qui-
etly  is ample excuse for-

  ignorance he mocked seeing he
had struck the right tack to provoke me
ignorance no man but an ignorant
yankee bumpkin would attribute great-
ness to that virginia farmer who turned
traitor to king george a traitor and-

  he got  further my sword was
out

   m de perier i cried as i sprang to
the attack  take your daughter to one
of the inner rooms her fiances death
may not be pleasant to witness

  then we were at it hot and heavy
sword to sword up and down the room
overturning chairs smashing fragile table
ornaments kicking rugs into disarray

  i took the aggressive from the first
but did not fully let myself out until i
saw with the corner of my eye m de
perier forcibly draw the trembling elise
to the farther room and close the door on
her

  then i flew at my adversary with all
the fury of a man whose country and
whose countrys idol have been insulted
with all the deadly fencing skill bred of
long years practise under the cleverest
maitres darmcs france could boast

  i had endured insults without num-
ber-a blow itself-in that room it
was good to be at last free to revenge
my shameful injuries and revenge
them i would

  de grieux was a strong man and tall
he was a good swordsman too yet
with the mysterious  fencers instinct
i felt before we had fought thirty sec-
onds that i was his master

  i pressed him back little by little
forcing him ever to shift his ground
hurling in thrusts and lunges with all
the speed and accuracy of an arm trained
and strengthened by years of practise

  now i parried one of his thrusts feint-
ed and lunged eluding his guard and
touching him on the chest

  it was but a flesh wound i scored but
i knew i would soon or late be able
to drive home the finishing thrust and

at sight of the fleck of blood that stained
his shirt-ruffle a cold relentless rage
took hold of me as  have known it to
do on the battle-field and i pressed my
advantage the harder

  brave man as he was de grieux
knew he had met more than his match
yet he fought on despairingly and with
a fury equal to my own

  our crossed blades grated and whined
together flashing forth long shimmering
rays from the candle-light we were
beginning to breathe heavily too

   de periers set excited face came once
into my range of vision he had left
the door of the inner room and in his
tense interest had drawn  nearer and
nearer to us as we fought

  after a series of thrusts that de
grieux guarded with increasing uncer-
tainty i saw that all was ready for
my final stroke a bewilderingly swift
feint that would leave his guard open
to my lunge-and then-

  the inner door was thrown open and
elise advanced into the room her
father saw her and seized her shoulders
as she would have run between us but
i had seen her face in the candle-light

  and at the unspeakable look in those
wide luminous eyes of hers my love
surged back upon me killing the death-
hate that had just filled my whole being

  she loved this man this man who
fought at my mercy were i to slay
him the thrust that laid him low would
kill her heart as well and i who loved
her would then be murderer alike of
her lover and her love

  all at once i felt as if it were she
not de grieux who stood before me
awaiting death at the thought i knew
i could not kill my adversary

  yet i made the feint i had planned
only instead of driving my blade to the
hilt through de grieuxs heart i made
a light quick cut that struck from his
waistcoat the lowest lapel button

  the button had been directly above
his heart he noted what i had done
and he understood that i held his life
in the hollow of my hand and-was
sparing it

  as his sword wavered in momentary
confusion at my inexplicable act of
mercy i made use of another trick i
had long ago learned


the argosy

  with a sudden wrench my blade slid
down his and jerked it from his hand
his sword flew across the room and
struck the far wall

  starting back as i disarmed him de
grieuxs foot caught in a crumpled rug
and he fell heavily to the floor the
impact of his head on the polished
boards momentarily stunned him and he
lay motionless

  but as though in echo to the sound
of his fall a second crash sounded from
the other side of the room the bolted
outer door flew open with a rending of
rotten wood and through the gaping
aperture poured uniformed men

   in the name of the republic of
france  roared the foremost

  a glance told me these were not mere
gendarmes drawn thither by the sound
of fighting they wore the national
guard uniforms and their leaders chest
was crossed by the dreaded insignia of
the committee of public safety

  and then i knew word must some-
how have reached the government that
the comte de grieux proscribed aristo-
crat had ventured back to paris

  his whereabouts being known a
squad of guaidsmen had been sent to
arrest him here in his insecure hiding-
place hence the unheralded assault
upon the room designed in order to
give the prey no time nor chance to
escape

  every hotel every lodging-house had
its government spies in those days de
grieuxs love must indeed have been
strong thought i to lure him here al-
most to certain capture

  but the french aristocrats ever lacked
forethought had they not there need
have been no french revolution

  de perier and elise alike understood
even as had i the cause of the intru-
sion the lieutenant in command strode
toward us

  which is the emigre grieux he
asked sternly looking in doubt from my-
self to the man on the floor who now
began to stir feebly

  so the guillotine was to finish
what i had begun well it was de-
cidedly no affair of mine i shrugged
my shoulders and slipped my sword
back into its sheath

  which is citizen grieux repeated

the lieutenant more- harshly  answer
in the name of the-

  as ill luck would have it his eye
fell on elise this time the question
was addressed to her like a little child
afraid her eyes turned to me in what
i read for the very sublimity of appeal

  and then i committed my crowning
act of folly

   i am the comte de grieux at your
service my man said i in an offensively
haughty tone  what do you wish of
me 

  elise drew in her breath sharply
de perier stared unbelieving at hear-
ing my admission the lieutenant had
drawn a paper from his belt

   citizen grieux he declaimed in a
nasal singsong tone  in the name of
the french republic represented by the
committee of public safety i arrest
you fall in  he ordered his men

  two of them stood on either side of
me

   citizen grieux resumed the lieu-
tenant in the same singsong  you are
charged-

   did you address me  came a dazed
muddled voice from the floor behind us

  de grieux had risen on one elbow
still but half-conscious and uncertain
as to where he was he had dimly caught
the repetition of his own name and had
replied to it i must act quickly

  be still i shouted to him in af-
fected contempt  or must my sword
teach you another lesson american it
is lucky you come in force lieutenant
i went on braggingly  or i should serve
you as i served that fellow braith there
who dogged me to this room and sought
to arrest me in the same name of your
upstart republic

   come i added  if i am to be
jailed for the crime of being better born
than scum like yourselves let us be
moving there is no need to read me
the list of my offenses i have no wish
that this lady and her father should be
further distressed on my account i
forced my way in here upon them hoping
to borrow money for my needs but
they are so foolish as to be attached to
that same rag-bag republic of yours and
they ordered me away come we
waste time

  march  ordered the lieutenant
the crimson harvest



taking my sword from its scabbard and
leading the way toward the door

  i followed close at his heels my two
guards clanking along on either side
of me

  no no screamed elise starting
from her daze of horror and struggling
to fling herself forward past her fathers
detaining arms  you must not lieu-
tenant he is-

  but de periers hand closed over her
mouth choking back the cry

  and so i left them

   vive la guillotine  shrilled a be-
lated street urchin as we passed into
the midnight darkness of the rue st
honor e

chapter x

  shadrach bemis miracle-worker

  through the stillness of the almost
empty paris streets we marched my cap-
tors and i the tramp of feet and click-
ing of martial accouterments echoed
from the tall houses lining the roadway

  we crossed the boulevard to my
surprise we did not turn toward either
the conciergerie or la force the two
foremost prisons but in a different di-
rection from either

   where are we going   i asked the

lieutenant

   to jail he answered laconically

   really  i exclaimed in mock
amazement  i fancied from your
weird costumes that we were on our
way to a comic masquerade

  now if there was one thing a french
national guardsman adored in those
days it was his gaudy uniform many
a duel was fought with those who criti-
cized the absurd costume so as i had
intended my sneer added tenfold to my
escorts hitherto impersonal dislike for
myself

  i was glad of this the more they
hated me the surer they were not to sus-
pect they had made any error in my ar-
rest i wished to be taken to the prison
office to be locked up for the night if
possible as the comte de grieux

  this would give the real de grieux
ample time to escape from paris and to
take elise and her father along if
might be

  for myself now that  had time to
think matters over i had little to fear
i was an american citizen as such the
french government would think twice
before beheading me all i need do
was to make known my plight to the
hon gouverneur morris our minister
to france

  we made our way through an alley or
two and thence northward i knew now
where we must be going for that way
lay the prefecture of police

  there i was doubtless to be lodged
for the night and undergo my prelim-
inary examination next morning prior
to commitment to one of the prisons

  as we came out upon the wider thor-
oughfare again beyond the hailes i
descried a figure crossing the street in
front of us one glance was enough
and despite the lieutenants sharp order
for silence i called

   bemis shadrach bemis 

  the old trapper on the way home
from one of his customary nightly ram-
bles heard and turned toward me his
lean face screwed up with astonishment
at my odd plight

   le grand samage  laughed the
lieutenant recognizing him

  but bemis shoved past him and was
at my side

   how in blazes- he began

  i cut him short and told him briefly
and in english as much of my story as
was needful this i had to do in de-
cidedly few words for the guards as
quickly as possible thrust us asunder

   shall i shoot one of em an give
you a chance to cut an run shadrach
asked

   no i answered  im going to the
prefecture go first thing in the morn-
ing to the american embassy tell-

   i understand he called back as the
guards broke off my instructions by
hustling me away

  and i felt i could safely leave my
case in the shrewd old backwoodsmans
hands so with a lighter heart i ac-
companied my captors to the prefecture

  there my name and pedigree were de-
manded by a yawning blear-eyed desk
official feigning sullenness i refused
to answer

  the official eager to get back to lied
gruffly consigned me to a cell for the


the argosy

night thither i was conducted as
soon as the iron door clanged shut be-
hind me  threw myself on the narrow
board cot and in a moment was deep in
the heavy slumber of physical and men-
tal fatigue

  it was not yet sunrise when a gen-
darme opened my cell door roused me
and ordered me into the outer office
the same sleepy fellow was at the desk
beside him lolled shadrach a court in-
terpreter at his elbow

  thats him observed bemis as i
was led forth  well young feller
he continued addressing me with a cant-
ing air of disapproval  a nice mess
youve got us all into aint ye what
your pore old fatherll say i dont know
ive told them ere gentlemen you cant
speak a word of french so theyve got
an interpter to do the talkin if anys
needed

  i was at sea to explain this cryptic
speech all i could gather from it was
that i was supposed to know no french
but why i could not imagine

   this plice officer went on bemis
 is goin to give you one more chance
but ive told him if any of his men
ketches you on another spree theyre to
lock you up fer a month come on
home now

  the grinning interpreter kept up a
running translation under his breath for
the officials amusement bemis affixed
a sprawling signature to two papers
slipped a louis into the interpreters
hand caught me roughly by the coat
and led me out through the vaulted arch-
way into the street

  there he linked his arm in mine and
set off at a tremendous pace

  what-what does it all mean i
demanded in amaze

  it means your plumb foolishness
came near gettin you into all sorts of
trouble he replied never checking his
gait  lord son what a night youve
give me were goin pretty fast now
but its the slowest ive moved since you
an me parted last evenin

  where have you been what-
where aint i been fust to the
hotel where i makes bold to drop in fer
advice on your perier friends my
what a state they was in but miss
elise manages to tell me all about it

all about your crazy actin son that
business was the wildest unreasonablest
worst thing i ever heard on ail-an
id like to shake your silly hand
which he did with muscular fervor
then resumed

   tother feller had decamped by the
time i got there he got away with a
whole skin thanks to you then i went
to the united states embassy minister
morris was just home from a ball an i
guess he was pretty tired for it was past
midnight but he saw me

   i told you not to go there till this
morning i interrupted

   so you did so you did but im
bad at obeyin orders besides i had a
kind of sneakin notion that this was a
case where a little hurry wouldnt do no
great harm to any one cept maybe to
the count feller

   it was on his account i wanted you
to wait till this morning so he might
have time to escape

   yes waal mournin cloes is
pretty dear but we neednt a wore
any on his account so off i goes to
gouverneur morris like i told you

   and he arranged my release of
course i must call to-day and thank
him but why did you make such a
queer scene just now at the-

   son you make more mistakes in
fewer words than any man i ever met
answered bemis  for one thing
morris didnt arrange your release for
another youd better not call on him
to-day an-

  didnt arrange my release said i
in astonishment  then how in-

   it was old shadrach bemis what
got you off he announced with a lu-
dicrous self-complacency

   look here  i cried angered by
his conceited air  i was arrested last
night as the comte de grieux a pro-
scribed aristocrat that is a case for
fouquier-tinville and then the guillo-
tine even morriss influence would be
strained to prove me an american and
not an emigre-and to induce the french
government to take a lenient view of
my share in de grieuxs escape so
why do you claim you set me free

   i dont know why i said it son
he answered ruefully  unless maybe
because twas so
the crimson harvest



  i saw at last that there was something
more than mere boasting in his words
the trapper was in earnest

  tell me about it i suggested still
in doubt

   i went to morris he began nothing
loath  an i told him the story when
i got to your name up he flies in a
temper says hes sick o the very name
of  braith says youre a scoundrel
sneakin under an american name an
citznship an not entitled to either he
wont git uncle sams fingers burnt in
no more of your scrapes he says an
th law can take its course then-
what i gasped  gouverneur
morris said this of-me

   that an a lot more jest as flatterin
an winds up by stampin out of the
room an sayin hell hear nothin more
 but i dont understand i never
met minister morris and none of my
affairs have yet come before him for
adjustment what can he mean by-

   lets git to that later ive got an
idee of my own will i go on with
this story or wont i  

   go ahead i said confusedly my
brain sick with bewilderment  what
next 

   out he stamps leavin me alone in
his place i was just goin to foller
when i thinks maybe ill have better
luck with some of his sectaries so i
hangs around waitin for one of em
to happen in on the way to bed just
to amoose myself i looks over some of
the papers layin around loose on the
study table dretful untidy chap that
morris man is

  you mean you read his private pa-
pers 

   i dont know how private they was
most of em was in french an didnt
mean much to me but i found one
with an english translation pinned onto
it i read that one it was kind of
intrestin 

   and you read a personal document
of-

   i sure did an youd better be
thankful instead of so stiff about it
cause if i hadnt read it youd still
be coolin them gilded heels of yourn
in jail

  was it about me then

   not till i made it so it was a

letter from an american whose son had
got into some kind of trouble over here
the feller was in jail on charge of in-
sultin the govment his fathers a
senator an hed got ginrl washing-
ton to endorse his letter askin morris
to get the lad off an sent it to morris
an morris got a order of release from
th cmittee of public safety an-
say son he interpolated  these
frenchies sure dont know a joke when
they see one if they did theyd a died
a laughin every time they heard that
measly cmittee called  safety its
about as  safe  as an angry rattler
id sooner-

   but-

   oh the story i forgot waal
the documents was all pinned together
translations an all an tacked to that
one long sheet of paper the order of
release was dated yesterday an it was
made out in blank out o compliment
to morris i spose i reckon it had
come that evenin while morris was out
an he hadnt had chance yet to-

   so you-

   i just unpinned the order from the
rest for fear it might fall into some dis-
honest fellers hands it was foolish
for morris to leave it layin about so
careless for all he knew it might a
been used to git some other pore pris-
ner out o jail to make sartin it
shouldnt be misused that way i jest
put temptation out of anybody elses
reach by fillin in yojur name

   good old bemis good old boy 
i cried but-

   or leastways twasnt your name
but this mister dee groos

   de grieuxs

   thats the one id made miss
elise spell it out fer me an i wrote
it straight then seein i wasnt wanted
at morriss an jest nacherally hatin to
be a unwelcome guest i leaves the em-
bassy an-

   and came to the prefecture with
the order

   not me i hunted round till i
found a jonny-darm that could speak
some english an i found from him
where the court interpter lived an i
routed him out of bed and brought him
along told him bout how i was your
old uncle sent over from the states to


the argosy

bring you back said you was a drinkin
dissoloot youngster an that youd got
inter trouble before an i was goin to
take you straight home an i gave the
interpter a bit of gold every few min-
utes to pay him for his bother in gettin
up so early by the time we got to the
jail he loved me like a white-haired
twin brother

   oh you clever old fraud  i ex-
claimed  ill never-

   oh yes you will next time you
git mad at me but never mind all
that the interpter sailed into that
feller in charge of the desk in a way to
satisfy the most fastijis tother feller
wasnt fairly awake an all he could see
clear was a couple of gold looeys i
passed him he had you turned out of
your cage an-an here we are if
wed a waited till later thered a been
a whole lot of nosey jacks-in-office in
charge there an we mightnt a got off
so easy

   but de grieux is a french name
i objected  why didnt they know an
american wouldnt have such a-

   what does any of these furreners
know about our country the interpter
achlly asked me was it true we hunted
bufflo in noo york whatd they know
of america or american names no
more than a yankee pliceman would
know of french

   shad i said in amaze at it all
 do you know youve committed theft
from our own embassy that youve
cheated the french government that
you-

    that youre walkin free instead of
takin a-course of guilltine shavin he
supplemented  that last is all i care
about well jest put the rest down to
the charge account but im kind o
sorry i had to fool that interpter he
was a nice feer seemed real intrested
in how i came to lose my scalp an-
 so you told him the scalp story
too i queried what version this
time 

   the true one he snapped  same
as i tell every one same as i told
minister morris last night i-

   did you tell gouverneur morris
about-

   i-well-that is t kind of pleaded
witli him when he wouldnt help me

i pinted to my head where a british
shell had took off a part of the scalp
an begged him in memry of my patri-
otic wound to - now what are you
laughing at he ended peevishly

   shad i groaned in despair  thats
the twelfth utterly different version of
your last scalp that ive-hallo i
broke off whats all this

  we had turned into the square where
stood the abbaye prison and were about
half-way across the open space from
a street to the right burst into the square
a screaming cursing mob of men
women and children they were fight-
ing tooth and nail to break through a
tight cordon of national guardsmen
and to attack some one who walked in
the center of the clump of soldiers

  a i second glance-even at that dis-
tance - showed me the prisoner they
were striving to murder was a woman-
a young girl

chapter xi

a red interlude

  for a moment my heart stood still
to me the sight of a girl in the hands
of the french law meant but one thing
-elise perier and illogical in my
dread i ran forward toward the on-
coming throng

  a statue of  equality  stood in the
center of the square for better view
i jumped up on its high pedestal shad-
rach scrambled up beside me

  what ails you son he queried
eying the advancing crowd

  but i had caught a glimpse of the
captives face and at sight of it i
heaved a great sigh of relief it was
not elise it was no one i had ever
before seen yet my first reaction over
there was something in her look that
held my gaze and that seemed to draw
the heart out of me

  it was not that the girl was beautiful
or even because she was in peril of in-
stant death her face was not lovely
not really pretty but one to compel
attention

  she was short - little more than a
child in statue-but with a rather broad
powerful figure her long brown hair
had come undone and poured in heavy
the crimson harvest



masses over her shoulders framing a
dead-white face whose huge gray eyes
glowed with an unearthly light that
seemed to illumine her whole counte-
nance

  she was plainly clad not as a serv-
ant but as perhaps a small shop-keepers
daughter might be dressed her step
had the grace and her bearing the glad
fearlessness of a pagan priestess

  four deep around her marched the
guard while other soldiers with bayonet
and musket-butts sought to batter back
the surging throng but the mob threw
itself madly on the opposing weapons
shrieking cursing mouthing horrible
threats shaking fists and clubs at the
barely protected maiden who as though
unconscious of their presence strode on
amid her encircling captors

  the crowd was made up of the scum
of paris frowzy-haired fishwives pur-
ple of face and streaming-haired raga-
muffins that looked as if they had been
hurled from some filthy underworld by
an upheaval of mother earth these
and a score of other types of the day
bred of the hideously satiric slogan
liberty equality fraternity

  there was nothing new in the rabble
to hold my attention but i marveled
none the less at their presence a single
prisoner or even a group of such haled
to the nearest jail was no novelty in
those days scarce enough so to evoke a
stray glance a handful of mud or the
cry  l lis les aristocrats

  yet here were close upon a thousand
riffraff not only accompanying a pris-
oners trip to the cells but trying to tear
her to pieces on the way thither

  what did it mean a larger more
rabid assemblage could scarce have gath-
ered to escort queen marie antoinette
herself to the guillotine

  the soldiers on their route to lab-
baye passed close by the base of the
 equality  statue on whose tall pedes-
tal shadrach and i were standing the
pressure of the throng eddying about
the base caused by sheer weight of
numbers a momentary halt in the pro-
cessions march

  in that brief rest before the outlying
guards could beat a passage for their
fellows through the press the girl
seemed to become aware for the first

time of the mobs presence lifting her
head proudly she faced that yelling
seething crowd and in a voice like a
silver trumpets cried aloud

  my friends my brothers what
i have done was done for the father-
land  for france  i-

  she got no further a mingled howl
and roar from the rabble drowned her
clarion shout at the same instant the
guards clove a way through the press
and the ghastly procession took up its
march again at faster pace

  a crippled beggar who had been left
behind in the increased rate of speed
paused for breath at the statue base i
leaned over and accosted him

   citizen i asked tossing him a
franc who is the prisoner and what
has she done 

   i dont know he answered impa-
tiently over his shoulder as he hobbled
off yelling  down with her 

  but my gift of a coin had excited
the cupidity of one of the street gamin
who hung to the outskirts of the mob
noticing my action he dashed back to
where we stood and held his cap up-
ward for a similar offering

   i know what its all about  he
squawked in pride  for a franc ill
tell you

  i held the silver piece in my hand
above his head but did not drop it into
his waiting ragged cap

   speak first i ordered

   citizen marat he announced fair-
ly bursting with the joy of being first
to tell any one the great news  citizen
marat-the liberator the friend of the
people the-

  what of him i inquired shud-
dering inwardly at mention of the fa-
natic demagogues name  what of
him  

   he is dead murdered in his bath
she jerking his thumb toward the van-
ishing procession  she killed him her
name is cordav curse her charlotte
corday

shadrachs ideas

  the fanatic glorified face of char-
lotte corday still fresh in my memory


the argosy

i continued  my way with bemis
back toward our hotel i wanted to
make one more appeal to de perier to
take his daughter out from this accursed
city ere he and she should become hope-
lessly enmeshed in the ever-spreading
terror-web

  also i was human enough to long
for an interview with elise in the light
of the previous evenings happenings
 knew she had noted to the full my
quixotic service to her betrothed and
that such service must go far toward
wiping from her thought the former ill
opinion of me that had been forced
upon them

  my act had not been that of a spy
or a kidnaper even prejudiced old
de perier must recognize that

  though she was lost to me and about
to wed another man it none the less
gave me a little miserable thrill of joy
to feel  had softened her contempt of
me all i now asked was to guard and
serve her

  if she was to be the wife of another
and if my own future life was to be but
a grave of loves memories i was none
the less minded to help her to what
happiness and refugee existence could
offer

  if my unselfishness could not force
me to include de grieux in my kinder
feelings who could blame me i had
acquired a very lively and natural dis-
like for the graceful brave young noble
what unsuccessful lover would not

  shadrach bemis as we walked along
broke in on my reverie bringing me vio-
lently back to the present

   son he observed  from that
mooney look of yourn i take it youre
thinkin of miss elise an nice and
natral it is for you too only this
aint the time for sech sugary dreams
you got suthin livelier to rastle with
jest now

  what for instance i asked
humoring him

   oh but it must be grand to be a
youngster he retorted to be ram-
blin along on the edge of a canon half
an inch from the precpice an yet be
able to think of nothin but a pretty
gal  

   you think im in danger

   i dont think nothin about it he

said grimly  i know it while youve
been mixin up in love business ive
been doin some figurin in my mind
an ive come to two or three kinds o
queer conclusions want to hear em
dont trouble to unless-

   go ahead  i replied  what are
they 

   fust  of all he began slowly
 theres some one in paris who aint a
double of yours nor a twin brother nor
any of them story-book things but who
looks enough like you to cause a whole
lot of-

   ive gathered that much already
i interposed  and-

   an have you figgered it out any
further  

  no i admitted i have not
have-

   waal  have you dont know
anything about him moren that hes
most likely one of the he-coons of this
revlootion outfit an that some folks-
robbyspeer an his gang-thinks pretty
high of him an thanks to that he
stands solid while the robbyspeer bunch
is on top likewise that theres a whole
passel of other folks asd look on it as
a reel sunday-school treat to be able to
snuff him out thats all you know
about this ere feller whos been gitten
you in such a mess of scrapes lately
now-

   yes i agreed  thats all i know
of him and most of that is conjec-
ture but-

   but he knows a whole lot more
about you son

 about me absurd why he
probably doesnt even know i exist
he-

   dont know you exist eh i spose
that accounts fer his usin your name
so free an promiskus

   good lord man i never con-
nected-

  of course you didnt you was
spendin your valble time sighin about
a girl an trying to rime  love  with
 dove an yet when youre sane
youre a real clever chap honest i
wonder at your thickness these days
wake up -man if you dont want ol
missus guilltine to put you to sleep
for good want to hear more of my
idees 
the crimson harvest



   yes i said all attention now  i
do

   this mysterous feller pursued
shadrach  maybe hasnt seen you he
maynt even know youre in france
an hes passin himself off as you he
got robbyspeer an the public pros-
cutor to let him put miss elise into that
convent place an sign your name to the
commitment now the prosecutor chap
might be bribed to do that but robbys-
peers said to be so straight he bends
backward thats what i cant make
out howd he get such a hold over
robbyspeer an by usin your name
if hes a revlootionist boss robbyspeer
must know all about him an must know
his real name aint braith an that he
aint an american yet he seems-

   whoever he is i put in remember-
ing the scene at montmartre  he is
known as jack braith american
and from the way people add the
 american it looks as if they dont be-
lieve it or that they are just quoting
his own words about himself how
could he have got hold of my name
and for what reason weve only been
here a few weeks he must have as-
sumed the name before then so it cant
be that my arrival in paris has-

  jest what i said chimed in shad-
rach  i doubt if he even knows youre
in france youve been livin pretty
quiet up to yesterday an-

   but if he doesnt know im here-
 if he doesnt hes sure to find it
out mighty soon some of these spies
that happens to know him are sure to
mention theres another jack braith
american stayin in town an when
he finds that out-

   then we can meet and i-

  oh son  scoffed bemis  youre
plumb foolish dye spose hes stole
your name an nationality jest for a
measly joke not he i dont know
what his reasons is but you can gamble
theyre good useful ones so it looks
plain to me he wont be over happy at
learnin that the real jack braith turned
up in paris two jack braiths is one
too many an it aint much of a stretch
to figger out that hes likely to fix up
a little guilltine party for your benfit
as soon as he finds you atotv do you
see youre in danger here

   no i returned  not in the least
these crazy revolutionists can cut off
each others heads to their hearts con-
tent but when it comes to laying
hands  an american citizen our min-
ister will have something to say and
when uncle sam orders  hands off 
people have a way of obeying him

   hm  grunted shadrach  all
you say bout uncle sam is true son
but when it comes to your own case
thats a horse of another color didnt
minister morris git maddern a wet hen
the very minute i says your name i
couldnt count on findin one of them
blank release orders every time i hap-
pen to drop in on him next time it
might-

   thats true  i had to confess
 this man whos stolen my name seems
to have used it and my nationality once
too often as far as gouverneur morris
is concerned im afraid i could look
for little help after all from our em-
bassy

   hes imposed on morris somehow
went on shadrach  an morris has
found out he aint american so if
it came to your usin that same jersey
name to git you out of jail youd be
lible to stay behind bars all your life
before the ministerd help you no
son you see whar you stand youre
jest a coquettin with the guilltine by
bangin on here in paris let this fel-
ler git on your trail-which hes bound
to before long-an youre a dead man

   upon my soul i laughed uncom-
fortably  youre a cheery companion 

   i aint extra strong on refined hu-
mor retorted bemis  but im talkin
good horse-sense an you know it ill
tell you suthin else that any one but a
lover would a seen before now this
other feller has reasons for wantin to
git miss elise comftably out of the
way so he put her in the convent
what them reasons of his are i dont
know not bein a prophet nor a mind-
reader but they must a been pretty
strong ones to make him risk the
chance of gettin nabbed for misusin
state dockyments fer persnal grudges
an-

   but tell me what harm has mile
de perier- 

   besides he went  unheeding


the argosy

 its dollars to doughnuts that it was
him who sicked the national guards
onto that de groo count last night
must have spies at the hotel when
them spies tell him miss elise got away
from the convent hell start another
game to get her locked up if he aint
done it already there son dont
look so sick pull yourself together
and face it like a man

   had quickened my pace almost to a
run in my haste to reach the hotel but
the backwoodsmans long easy stride
readily kept up with me

   hell most likely ask questions at
the convent too continued shadrach
 then id like to see his face when the
abbess tells him it was jack braith that
let miss elise out thatll give him
the tip youre in paris if he aint al-
ready got it from somewhere else you
got scandlous little time to waste jack
 what do you advise then 

   git your traps together an light
out o paris before night

   and leave elise here to-

   you cant help her any by stayin
make her come away too if she wont
then kidnap her if you like ill help
you carry her and the old man acrost

the frontier ill think up some way to
arrange it

   made no reply we had turned
into the rue st honore and i broke
into a run into the hotel i dashed and
up-stairs to de periers suite

  the door swung wide within a
man was moving i entered without
ceremony it was no time for etiquette
observances

  i came upon gelat the proprietor
taking inventory of some personal effects
that lay scattered about

   where is- i began

  he cut me short with a grunt of
anger

   gone  he snapped  he and the
citizeness his daughter an hour ago
a pretty name this sort of thing will
give my poor hotel with the government
to think that-

  gone i repeated  they have
left paris

   they will leave paris by way of
heaven he grinned  they were ar-
rested-both of them-by a squad of
national guardsmen for the crime of
 harboring and aiding a proscribed
aristocrat the guillotine deals quickly
with such cases

                              to be continued

h er ideal in the gray overcoat

                     by r k thompson

         the man she saw in the street-car regretted she should never see again
         only to have him turn up in the guise of a thoroughly unwelcome visitor

there i decided stealing a sec-
a ond glance across the street-car
 sits my ideal man 

  the adonis in the liglit-gray over-
coat looked in my direction and i hastily
lifted my eyes to the advertisement of a
breakfast-food farther down the car

  riding up-town to the studio-apart-
ment i shared with grace marshall an
old school-chum my idle gaze out of the
opposite window had suddenly been ob-
scured by the broad shoulders and hand-
some head of the man who dropped into
the vacant seat across the aisle

  unconcernedly i swept another glance
at him from the crown of his becom-

ing derby to the tips of his shapely shoes
-taking in his clean-cut face athletic
build and well-formed perfectly-gloved
hands-he was the capitalized real
thing in twentieth-century prince
charmings aware of my eyes upon him
he glanced at me again-to discover my
gaze riveted on a section of atmosphere
eight inches above his head when i
felt him look away i took another peep
at him out of the corner of my eye

  why was it i wondered a bit petulant-
ly that conventionality made it so hard
to meet people you didnt know but
liked on sight

  here was an utter stranger a man
her ideal in the gray overcoat



whose looks i admired who would al-
ways be utterly a stranger to me because
convention labeled him  not properly
introduced

  i liked the way he sat the way he
held his head the way he had looked at
me twice without staring yet he was
simply a figure glimpsed in the passing
show about me i should never see him
again after i left the car at the next
corner

  which of course didnt matter for i
am not  wooshy as grace defines the
sentimental womans state of being i
would continue to exist quite happily
despite the fact that i never knew the
handsome stranger

  only-i did wish we could have met
i wanted to find out if he were really as
nice to talk to as he was nice to look at

  as i signaled the conductor to stop at
the next crossing snuggling closer the
portfolio of sketches i carried under my
arm i shouldnt again have noticed the
man as i rose-if he hadnt walked down
the aisle before me and descended from
the car at the same corner

  by a coincidence he was getting off at
my street i watched him reach the side-
walk ahead of me from whence he might
depart in any one of three directions-
up or down the avenue or along the
street down which i was to go

  unhesitatingly he  took the latter
course following i momentarily ex-
pected him to disappear into some one
of the shops or office-buildings along the
way but he kept right straight ahead
his more vigorous pace separating us by
fully a quarter of a block jet his grace-
ful figure still plainly in view

  i had just asked myself where he was
going for the fifth time in two minutes
when i started forward with an excla-
mation of surprise

  the man had turned into the entrance
of the very building for which i was
headed i saw his familiar gray over-
coat vanish into the hallway of the tall
sandstone-fronted edifice where grace
and i had our top-floor abode

  there was nothing unusual in the fact
that he had gone in there the building
held a score of studios and apartments
at any one of which he might be calling
yet the coincidence of his leaving the
car at the same time i did struck me as

a little odd since his final destination was
the same as mine  hurried after him

  as i entered the hall the clang of a
closing elevator-door greeted my ears
i was too late for more than a fleeting
sight of well-known gray glimpsed
through the grille-work of the cage which
rose with him out of my sight

  he was gone as i waited for the
second of the two elevators our building
boasts i told myself that i had seen the
last of mr gray overcoat-and i only
sighed once

  stepping out at my floor i searched
for my keys which so persistently eluded
me in some crevice of my bag that my
eyes and hands were busily hunting
them as i turned down the hall

  then the little bunch lightly jingling
in my hand i lifted my eyes and looked
toward my workshop-home and the
sight that there met my astonished gaze
brought me up sharply with a gasp of
amazement

  the man who had preceded me from
the street-car up the street and into this
very building cm now entering the door
of my apartments

  there was  doubt about it before
my very eyes his unmistakable figure
stepped across the threshold i saw and
heard the door close after his easily
recognizable gray overcoat

  i felt the strength running like the
fairy-tale gunpowder out at my knees
as the horrifying thought flashed like a
white-light of truth into my brain he
was a burglar

  my portfolio and with it my bag
slipped unheeded to the floor after the
keys which dropped from my nerveless
fingers i leaned weakly against the wall
my trembling limbs jarring into being a
million goose-pimples of fright on my
body

  the rooms that grace and i occupied
were at the mercy of the man i had
seen entering our apartments as coolly
and calmly as though they were his own
to plunder as he would my chum had
gone out that morning to visit a dozen
music-pupils i did not expect her back
until long after i had returned from the
office of the art editor of a down-town
magazine upon whom i had called that
afternoon

  what was t to do how was this


the argosy

daylight marauder who might even now
he uninterruptedly taking possession of
our silverware to be removed should
 send for the janitor or summon one
of the elevator-boys by a touch on the
bell near at hand and call a policeman
to take him in charge

  and how had he opened the door by
the way i had arrived on the scene too
late to discover by what means he had
effected an entrance he was just going
into the studio when i looked up after
stepping out of the elevator

  curiosity at length overcame my
tmidity and i stole with silent caution
along the hall to the door of our apart-
ments examination proved that it had
not been jimmied the man had
probably used a skeleton-key or else he
had delicately picked the lock

  he was evidently a hardened expert
at the business i thought for only long
experience could have taught him to open
a door as neatly as this one had been un-
locked it seemed a pity too that such
a handsome fellow-a man whose face
appeared to hold so much honesty of
purpose and strength of character-could
stoop to the occupation of a common
llat-robber

  if i had not actually seen him enter
that door i never would have believed
it possible that he had done it i blushed
to recall my thoughts of him of five
minutes before-a man i had branded
on sight as my ideal was a burglar

  but i had no time to waste in vain
regret over the discovered clay feet of
yet another shattered idol every mo-
ment i passed in inaction meant a length-
ened opportunity for the man inside to
rob our home

  as i stood outside the door the
thought of the robber within rifling our
household goods roused in me the in-
stinct latent in every one to fight for
his or her home when that cherished pos-
session is menaced anger against the
man who had dared to enter our rooms
thrilled me i was no longer afraid i
would enter the studio and myself re-
move its overbold occupant

  i put out my hand the strength of
my purpose stilling the cowardly trem-
bling of my limbs and softly turned the
handle the door was locked the spring-
catch had fastened in its closing-and i

dropped my fingers from the knob with
a little sigh of relief it was all very
well for a righteous indignation at the
desecration of my home to fill me with
a desire to drive out the invader but to
enter alone an apartment in which a
strong healthy man was somewhere lurk-
ing-that required a trifle more daring
than i felt was at present mine

  i was about to turn away and summon
outside assistance in evicting the intruder
when a sound from the rooms within
halted me the sound was a crashing
chord struck on our piano and it recalled
my waning courage like the trumpeting
of a battle-horn

  of all the nerve i thought as i took
a quifk step nearer the door it wasnt
enough i told myself as i noiselessly in-
serted my key in the lock and turned the
handle that the man had broken into
our flat but he must play our piano as
though to show how lightly he held the
consequences of his ruthess act

  i would show him i thought angrily
as i softly opened the door and stepped
into the private hall of our apartment i
would tell him what i thought of his
cheek his effrontery his impertinence
his unqualified gall and then i would
turn him out of the studio into the hands
of the police

  i stood outside the closed door of our
parlor listening to the song the musical
burglar sang as he played a rag-time ac-
companiment to which the sudden chord
he had struck was evidently an introduc-
tion he played well i noticed and his
voice was fairly musical

   all i get here is much obli-i-iged to
you   he sang spiritedly

   youll get six months in jail my
friend for coming in here  i promised
him viciously under my breath as i
waited outside the door trying to nerve
myself to enter the room and confront
him

  the song ended i listened in vain for
a break in the silence that followed

  then the thought suddenly struck me
that he was packing up our valuables
stealthily robbing the parlor of its orna-
ments again the fierce rebellion against
the despoiling of my home stirred me to
action i lost my fear threw open the
door determinedly and stepped across
the threshold
her ideal in the gray overcoat



  the man in the gray overcoat was
leaning over the front of the piano
studying on its top a photograph in a
silver frame as i paused in the door-
way he turned and looked at me the
picture-one of my own i hadgiven to
grace-dropped clatteringly to the floor

  in silence he stared at me over the
ruin of broken glass and twisted metal

  full as were my eyes of contempt for
the creature there was still room in them
to see as i looked steadily at him that
he was vastly handsomer with his hat off
his hair waved back from a splendid
brow-behind which i thought with a
curling lip was a brain only capable of
earning a living for its body by house-
breaking

   im afraid ive spoiled this picture-
frame he remarked not taking his eyes
from my face but indicating the wreck
on the floor by a slight motion of- his
head he smiled attractively  im
sorry for my clumsiness he added  but
your unexpected appearance startled me
my appearance had startled him
there was no cringing away from my
accusing gaze neither was any attempt
made to intimidate me by threatened
violence

  this burglar was probably of the new
school the gentleman-cracksman type
evidently he was going to bluff it out
until a means of escape from his pre-
dicament offered itself

  very well i thought if that was his
game i too would take a hand in it i
felt no fear of him

   it is of no consequence i answered
coldly  the picture has no value

   i beg your pardon he said quickfy
his eyes still steadfastly on me  it is
a photograph of you then it is de-
cidedly not valueless

  my face burned at his look and words
i could not doubt their meaning and his
insolence angered me

  perhaps you refer to the frame
i replied evenly  the silver is possibly
worth something to you

  his eyes widened and in turn he
had the grace to blush stooping he
carefully picked up the bits of bent
frame and broken glass from the floor

   you must have fallen on lean days
in your business i remarked spitefully
as i watched his bowed back and lowered

head  since you need bother to gather
up such a trifling amount of silver

  he rose to his feet and laid the wreck-
age on top of the piano as he dusted his
hands he looked keenly at my face while
a slow smile curved his lips

  come he said cheerily you
arent going to cherish any ill-feeling
against me because in effigy i  threw
you over  are you i dropped your pho-
tograph quite by accident i assure you 
 i am more surprised at your clum-
siness than anything else i retorted
thinking of the neat manner in which he
had forced open the studio door  i
should have thought you far too clever
for such carelessness

  he was stung by the sarcasm in my
voice for  could see the muscles of his
jaw tighten as he clenched his teeth
firmly at my words he turned and
walked across the room

   since you find you cannot pardon
my unintentional carelessness he said
arriving at the mantelpiece  i presume
i had better go

  he reached up for the heavy onyx-
and-gold clock over the fireplace and
brought it down  in his arms could i
believe my eyes was the man going to
carry off our most sacred belonging
under my very nose

   indeed you had better go  i cried
out unsuccessfully struggling with a
quaver of excitement in my voice  but
not with our clock 

  the man turned

   but this is what i came for he
said shifting its weight more comfort-
ably in his arms  and since i have it
i may as well leave at once

  the vandal actually admitted that
the purpose of his visit to our apartment
had been to steal our clock and it was
the one possession prized above all others
by grace and myself often we had told
each other that it was the only worth-
while thing we owned its polished
marble and gleaming gold shedding its
effulgence from the parlor-mantel
formed the piece de resistance in the
decoration of our home

  was i to see it stolen before my very
eyes-lost to us forever only over my
lifeless body i mentally determined as
i threw out my arms barring the door-
way with a hand on either casing


the argosy

  oh no i protested while a nerv-
ous laugh shivered through my voice
 you can go but the clock cant you
see it hasnt been going for a week so
it cant go i added hysterically

  the would-be abductor of our treasure
rested the sacred timepiece on the piano-
stool and reached for his hat

     know he said not looking at me
 thats why im going to take it away-
because it cant go itself

  my nails dug into the woodwork as
i tightened my clutch on the door-jamb
i could feel an icy perspiration breaking
out on my brow and in the palms of my
hands my eyes were wide and staring
fsom the strangle-hold of fear that
gripped my throat as the man took a
step toward me

  youre not i cried youre not
going to do any such thing 

  he looked up quickly and his lips
puckered in a slow whistle of surprise
as he took in my barricade of the door-
way then his chin hardened purpose-
fully and he picked up his loot

   if you will let me pass- he began
stepping forward

  stop i called

  the man paused and then backed away
before me as  advanced slowly into the
room keeping my eyes fixed on his face
in the center of the parlor he stopped
and i came up until i stood directly
before him

   how dare you attempt to take away
before my eyes- i began

   but my dear young lady- he
interrupted

   stop  i checked him raising un-
hand  dont speak-this has gone far
enough do you think that you can leave
this room with that clock-

   but i tell you-

   you tell me  i laughed scornfully

  you a-

   i broke off suddenly the word  bur -
glar  dying in my throat at the sound
of a light step behind me i wheeled-
to discover the alert figure of grace
poised in the doorway

  just in time i thought now there
were two of us to handle this fellow i
would keep him in the room while my
chum went down-stairs for a policeman

	 grace- i began taking a quick
step toward her

  then i halted in surprise at the ex-
pression on her face there was no won-
der in her survey of the scene she had so
suddenly come upon no amazement at
the unexpected sight of the strange man
still standing in the center of the room
why wasnt she astonished awestruck
frightened at the spectacle

   hallo kidlet  she called to me
 just got in i see tom have you
met-

  was i dreaming or crazy or-what
could this mean  besides taking the mat-
ter of my being alone in our home with
aburglar as something quite ordinarily
to be expected she seemed to know the
man-called him by his first name in
fact

   roberta she addressed me  let
me introduce you to tom jennings this
is my chum miss fletcher tom for
goodness sake what are you carrying
that clock around in your hands for
you arent going yet wait till i hang
up my hat and coat and well chat
a while

  my roommate walked out into the
hall mumbling an apology to the man
in the gray overcoat i dashed after her

   grace  i gasped pulling her into-
the dining-room and closing the door
hastily after us  what does this
mean 

   what does what mean silly  she
asked surprisedly staring at my wild eyes
and flushed face

  that man out there-who is he
i panted  where did he come from-
how did he get in here 

  why tom jennings is an old old
friend of mine grace answered wonder-
ingly  his fathers in the jewelry busi-
ness-worth millions by the way-and
when i met tom on the street the other
day and told him how badly our clock
was keeping time he offered to come up
and take it down to his fathers shop to
be fixed he called about fifteen minutes
ago but i had to go out after the salad
i forgot to order and i left him here to
wait till i got back roberta-whatever
is the matter 

  i was leaning helplessly against the
table all the strength sapped from my
body in the reaction i saw it all now-
why had i been so stupid as not to un-
derstand the situation before
her ideal in the gray overcoat

                                                   a



  the man i had seen entering our
apartments had been admitted by grace
-who had returned earlier than i ex-
pected and answered his ring which i
had arrived too late to hear then while
i stood in our private hall outside the
parlor door my chum had slipped out
through the back door that led to the
elevators leaving the stranger to be dis-
covered alone in our rooms

  between nervous laughter and hys-
terical tears i explained the whole story
to grace from my observation of the man
in the street-car to the scene with him
she had interrupted

   and if you ever breathe to a soul-
to him- i finished in impressive
warning

  you crazy little indian said my
chum  do you think id spoil this bud-
ding romance why you are the girl
tom raved about after he came in here
as a  dream of ideal beauty he saw in
the car  

   then i faltered happily  then he
noticed me too

  grace laughed as she pushed me
toward the parlor with a pat on the back

  he did-so thoroughly that his de-
scription of you was astonishingly com-
plete-for a man come on lets go
back and give him another look at you 
 but- i hesitated my hand on the
dining-room door  think of the things
i said to him about the silver in that

broken frame-and hes in the jewelry
business 

   make him forget it encouraged my
chum  be nice to him come along 
together we entered the parlor the
man in the gray overcoat turned from
the window and came toward us with
his hat in his hand grace advanced and
took it from his unresisting fingers as
she pushed him into our easiest easy
chair

   youre going to stay to tea tom
she informed him turning to the samovar
on the little tabouret at his side  so
make yourself perfectly comfortable
while the kettle boils

   well really he began half pro-
testingly with a swift glance at me
 miss fletcher might object to my ta-
king a cup  before her very eyes- 

  i smiled back at him

   not at all i answered  ill bring
it to you myself if youll promise to dis-
play the cleverness i know you possess-
and not drop it 

  a quick light grew in his eyes and
under its glow i felt my cheeks redden
but i looked bravely back my pulses
quickened then with a little gasp of
sudden gladness i turned toward grace
bending busily over the tea-things

  the man had not come into our home
to rob but he had stolen something there
just the same and he was an ideal
burglar

   when the sun sets

by stephen brandish

     author of  gordons getaway  when suspicion struck hard  at the mercycf the unseen

         the astounding experience of a business man who thought all his troubles
         were over just as he was on the eve of the greatest calamity in his career

synopsis of chapters previously published

    martin hoffman in charge of the galpin manufacturing company during the ab-
sence of young dick galpin finds the concern imperiled by the rival dalton company
he is in despair when theobald thomas a former member of the firm offers to take
over its four-hundred-thousand-dollar debt the papers must be signed by hoffman on
the next day when the debt falls due

    a man named gulick of the dalton company tries to bribe hoffman to leave town
until too late for this transaction that evening in his rooms during a visit from george
wellingford vice-president of the rival firm who offers him an increased bribe hoffman
is suddenly stricken blind exhausted by strain and worry and crazed with horror at
his loss of sight he hears as in a dream a number of men discussing his case he is
hurried off by them in an automobile to some house where lie is carried up-stairs and
laid  a bed he feels a sudden prick on his arm and sinks into unconsciousness

chapter v

ix the house of mystery

irst of all the pillow was soft
hoffman felt over it with sleepy
fingers yes and so far as his capacity
for judging went the cover was fine
linen the bed too was distinctly soft
and comfortable-even a little bit more
comfortable than usual if that were pos-
sible

  his head ached a trifle to be sure but
that was to be expected he had had
a bad day yesterday and to-day he was
going to have a fine day - the biggest
day in the history of the galpin com-
pany

  it must be about eight now hed
doze for perhaps fifteen minutes more
then hed get up and have a cold plunge
and a breakfast and after that get to
the office in time to meet thomas and
settle up all details

  oh it was glorious exhilaration
fairly surged through him and still-
what the dickens had happened last
night 

certainly something had gone wrong
-radically wrong he had a vague
recollection of wild dreams-of an auto-
began april argosy

  mobile ride-of doctors and judges and
  heaven only knew what else he re-
  membered dreaming of raving and rais-
  ing cain generally and-

    well it was over and he must get up
  now he rolled to his back and opened
  his eyes and-there was nothing there

    his breath stopped  with a choke in
  his throat he sat up and stared or tried
  to stare about him why there was
  nothing in sight at all so far as his
  eyes were concerned they told of abso-
  lutely nothing save an increased light-
  ness when he stared to the left - the
  direction from which the faintest of
  breezes was coming

    then he must actually be blind he
  gasped and reached for the button be-
  side his bed the button by which at
  times he ordered breakfast it was
  gone

    instead of the tapestry paper his fin-
  gers encountered a bare painted stretch
  of wall instead of the push-button
  there was-paint

   then it was all true the whole
 affair which he had just imagined to be
 a dream was actual fact he was blind

    an extremely soft footfall approached
  him and a low respectful voice said
  single copies  cents

j
the name of martin hoffman



  will you have breakfast sir 

  what  the blind man tried hard
 to look around

 breakfast sir

 hoffman swallowed hard his head
 was clear now-and thank god for the
 fact he might have been mad last
 night but his brain was working at
 present and be felt fairly able to grap-
 ple with conditions and

  will you kindly tell me who you
 happen to be he said slowly

  your special nurse sir

  and do i seem to need a special
 nurse 

 yes sir

  well ill be hanged  remarked
 the treasurer of the galpin company
 pensively

  yes sir  said the voice placidly
  would you like a little steak sir or
 some eggs or-

 the dazed man rubbed a hand over
 his sightless eyes ifor a long space he
 thought hard then

  i am - somewhere outside of my
 home he inquired with difficulty

  yes sir

 well where

  in dr coless sanatorium sir
 eh hoffman reflected further
  young man he said  i am blind
 you know that

  certainly sir

  well as nearly as i am able to
 judge it happened only last night is
 this a place for the treatment of the
 blind

  yes sir

 he seemed to be assuming things with
 an amazing accuracy he hazarded an-
 other query

  i have been brought here to be
 treated for my eyes

 yes sir

  then will you kindly tell me
 went on hoffman gently  who the deuce
 had the assurance to take me away from
 home without my permission

  it was your brother mr hoffman
 said the even voice

  did he give his name

  it was mr john hoffman sir re-
 plied the attendant patiently

 the treasurer reflected deeply
 certainly it was a rather curious state
 of affairs-more particularly as his only

brother happened to bear the name of
richard and to be several hundred miles
away he took to rubbing his throb-
bing eyes again for a time until

   the doctor said most particularly
that you must not rub your eyes sir he
said that you might have breakfast and
dress afterward if you wished after
that i think he will be up to see you
sir what shall i bring

   what time is it  

   nearly noon sir

   then hoffman pondered  bring
me a small steak and some hot rolls and
some potatoes and a couple of cups of
coffee thats enough

   very well sir

  the shuffling footsteps departed as
quietly as they had arrived

  for an instant there seemed to be a
whispered consultation somewhere in the
neighborhood then silence fell and the
blind man sank back and waited

  john hoffman-his brother who had
never existed dr coless sanatorium
of which he had never heard what the
dickens did it all mean anyway

  ten minutes of hard thought and he
had found but one definite conclusion
it was past ten in the morning and he
was not at the office that solitary fact
coursed on and on through his head

  he hadnt been on hand to sign the
notes for thomas and keep the old firm
above water there were three more
days to be sure but he very much pre-
ferred not to use them

  he thought on and on - and finally
breakfast came

  it was as delicate and delicious a meal
as skill could produce its extreme ex-
cellence in fact astounded the patient
he felt and ate his way through it rap-
idly though and at the end as the fin-
gers of the attendant ceased piloting his
own and the tray was removed he came
to the subject uppermost in his mind
with

  see here you-whats your name
   smith sir

   all right smith i want to dress
and get out of this

  you may dress sir - indeed your
clothes are here but t dont think the
doctor would allow you out sir

   well the doctor hasnt anything to
say about it in this case hoffman re-


the argosy

sponded serenerely  ive got to get
down to my office for half an hour at
least and youve got to steer me there
 the doctor would never hear to it
sir he gave the strictest orders that
you mere to be kept absolutely quiet

   then im afraid his orders are go-
ing to be disobeyed the patient re-
marked where are my clothes

  in silence the man brought them and
for the first time in his adult life the
treasurer of the galpin company was
forced to allow himself to be dressed
from top to toe

  the process was completed at last
and he stretched himself he m-as still
rather tired and stiff he m-as also stone-
blind  but his head seemed to be in
good shape again-and he had never
heard of a law barring a blind man from
business transactions

 well start now he announced
calmly  can you get an automobile
 the doctor said very positively just
now sir that you must not go out for
a day or two

  send him here then hoffman
commanded sharply

   hes just gone out for several hours
sir

   then let me ask you whether twenty
dollars m-ould bribe you to take me down-
town for an hour

   it wouldnt sir it would cost me
my job said the voice in rather sorrow-
ful monotony  and you couldnt do
anything without an attendant sir it
went on soothingly again  youd have
to have somebody with you sir and
theres nobody here mould dare go for
twenty or fifty for that matter youd
better sit domrn sir

  the man mas right-eminently right
the hard fact struck hoffman after the
manner of a blom everything else out
of the question he couldnt navigate
alone just yet under his new conditions

   yes id have to have an attendant
fast enough  he muttered bitterly
 but why the dickens cant i have an
attendant and-

   the doctor said that in these cases
of temporary paralysis of the optic
nerve absolute quiet was the first re-
quirement sir the attendant assured
him  youd better sit down in the big
chair sir and ill read to you if you

like just forget business altogether
sir and youll be at it again in a few
days and as well as ever 

  there mas a compelling monotony
about that voice hoffman began to
malk in the weak shuffle he seemed to
have acquired and quick hands caught
him and steered him to a thickly uphol-
stered chair

   he dropped into it with a disappoint-
 ed grunt

   look here smith he said with
mhat mtas intended for a friendly tone
where is this joint

    up-town sir

    whereabouts 

   oh mrell up-town sir shall i
read-

    wait a minute i want to ask you
a few questions first youre sure my
brother brought me here

   why yes sir with a couple of
doctors you were in a bad state last
night-very much overwrought and over-
worked sir now this novel-
hoffman sighed resignedly

    go on   be said  thank you

 the man might as mtell be reading a
novel as doing anything else that came
within his range as special nurse fur-
thermore it would give hoffmarjtime to
meditate in peace and decide what mas
best to do under the circumstances

   the story began it m-as a late pro-
 duction in fiction and the patient
 thanked his stars that he had read it
 for nom he could pick up the tale at any
 desired point and offer sane comments
 he sat back with a fair counterfeit of a
 contented sigh and smiled vaguely as he
 tried to assort the varied occurrences of
 the last twelve hours

   first of all velvet - gloved effects to
 the contrary he mras being detained
 somewhere against his will there mas
 no question whatever but that he must
 stay where be m-as until he devised fit-
 ting means of leaving

  it might be a sanatorium for the
blind it might be anything else just
at present he mas in no position to say
what it mras or to make any definite
hypothesis upon the matter-save that
one intention to get out

   secondly some one must have brought
 him here-and some one masquerading
 as a brother of his that last of course
the name of martin hoffman



was absolute nonsense richard was
south and he was the only brother
hoffman had ever owned

  and it was only yesterday morning by
the way that martin had had a letter
from him regretting that the end of the
week would have to see him homeward
bound

  no richard was altogether out of the
whole proposition some one else had
elected himself brother of martin hoff-
man and had succeeded in putting him
in this place - whatever eventually it
might turn out to be some one else
and-yes some one who understood the
various business matters that were im-
pending and wished to have him out of
the way

  that much seemed reasonably clear in
view of certain sums that had been
offered for his disappearance that was
it he had been put-somewhere

  now to find out where  somewhere 
happened to be and to get back to the
hotel and the office and see a doctor and
find out exactly what ailed his poor eyes
and how long it was going to take to
remedy the trouble after the thomas
business had been settled

  and for a beginning-

    she stood momentarily sweeping
him with a cold scorn and- eh are
you sleepy sir asked the voice of his
attendant

   well to tell you the truth im
pretty tired smith  hoffman re-
sponded with a hearty frankness as a
fresh idea came suddenly  im going
to lie down suppose you come over
and sit by me and go on

   very well sir there was a cer-
tain relief in the attendants voice as he
steered hoffman gently from the chair

  the short transit concluded the blind
man stretched out luxuriously as a blan-
ket was laid over him with the quick-
ening sense of hearing that seemed to
develop more markedly every minute he
knew that the man was taking a chair
beside him and opening the book again
-and the story went on

  and on and on until hoffman found
himself all things notwithstanding very
near a doze he caught himself and
was wide-awake again and acute in every
sense save that of sight

  the attendant was watching him as

the droning tone denoted he wrould
play his part as nicely as possible the
sightless eyes closed again and his
breathing gradually became slow and
regular he grunted softly and hud-
dled down more cozily under the blan-
ket-and to all outward appearances
he was asleep

  features peaceful and expressionless
he waited patiently the reading ceased
and there was an expectant pause hoff-
man permitted an artistic snore to es-
cape him the wait grew longer and
at last came a soft

  mr hoffman

  a long sibilant breath was the only
answer

   mr hoffman 

  the snore came again and it seemed
to have been a well-judged snore for
the attendant muttered

   sleeping again thank god well-
there was the sound of a chair being
pushed back softly the blanket about
him was tucked in more securely and the
light steps crossed-toward the door as
it seemed for there was he slightest
creak of a knob-and in an indistinct
way the man on the bed knew that for
the time he was alone

  for all of ten minutes he remained
motionless then as matters seemed per-
manently soundless he essayed a soft

   smith 

  there was no answer he waited a
minute and tried again
v smith

  and smith it appeared had left the
room on the instant hoffman thrust
one leg from under the covers-and then
the other-and there was no reproving
voice

  he cast off the blanket and stood
erect and no one filed an objection
erect he waited listening no sound
greeted his ear

  so that the time appeared ripe for a
tour of investigation-a tour which if
successful might land him in the street
and once there lack of hat and over-
coat notwithstanding he could find some
one any one who would tell him where
the cars were and how to get back to his
home and-

  he must not delay blind and strange
to the place and not altogether steady
he might be but he must make the


the argosy

best haste possible and find the way to
freedom before any further interference
came

  hands outstretched he started for-
ward hastily in a fairly definite way
he knew the direction in which his at-
tendant had gone he followed it as
swiftly as possible and-

  yes here was a wall here too was
some sort of woodwork and-ah here
was a door

  he found the knob and turned it and
walked-into a closet he backed out
quickly and searched on and in ajvery
few seconds he had found another door
and was seeking the knob

  an extremely queer sense of greater
space impressed him as he passed
through inquisitive fingers reaching
and waving through the air met a ban-
ister railing and he knew that he was
in a corridor and probably at the edge
of the stair-well he retreated to the
wall opposite and felt his way along
cautiously again

  a full dozen feet of progress-and he
had found another door he reached to
the left again and learned that he avas
at the turning-point of the banisters
that it seemed must mean the head of
the stairs

  logically they should lead to the
main corridor below he dared not try
them hed make a trip through this
doorway to the right if it happened to
be unlocked and see what aatas con-
cealed perhaps another and more
acclimated blind man avas there who
could tell him the way out

  perhaps-excited hope surged through
him as he tried the fastening exulta-
tion succeeded suddenly as the door gave
way before his hand and opened with-
out a sound

  little idea as he had of his avhere-
abouts he avas at least going someavhere
and the path might lead to the outer
world and-

  out of the limitless blackness there
came a sound of some one stirring
there avas a muffled exclamation the
sound then of a sudden fall as if some
one had thrown himself prostrate upon
the carpeted floor

  and then a strange voice rose deep
but querulous in reverent and respect-
ful tones with

   it is indeed the king it is indeed
the avise one boav ioav ye people all
hail king solomon 

chapter vi

in regard to clues

  the day-clerk as richard hoffman
observed avithout much interest stared
a little as the two bell-boys hurried to
the elevators avith the hand-baggage

furthermore the day-clerk observed

  too bad sir that you avere forced
to return so soon im very sorry sir 

   well you neednt cry about it dick-
son   mr richard hoffman comment-
ed as he hurried by avith his avife
 these things are bound to happen
you knoav one time and another

   yes sir certainly sir its al-
avays avell to be prepared for them as
it avere and to try to take them philo-
sophically mr hoffman the day-clerk
murmured as the elevator-gate closed
for its trip to suite 

  it avas in suite  some seven or
eight minutes later that the peculiar
tone avorked into the elder hoffmans
mind and set him avondering

   what in blazes avas the matter avith
dickson madge he inquired thought-
fully

  what dear

   he talked as if id just lost a leg
or something instead of merely being
called back unexpectedly by business
richard went on

  his avife laughed

   probably dickson knew how much
youd been counting on a avinter vaca-
tion she said

  but still- he paused i must
be getting imaginative  hoffman fin-
ished with a laugh  i guess the long
face made an impression on dickson
blast it i didnt want to come back 

   neaer mind the maid had bus-
tled in and fluffy things and things that
rustled and other things that swished
and crackled avere being laid out from
the trunks and the grips-and for the
time richard hoffman avas a quantity
ignored

  he intruded again shortly avith

   i aa-onder how poor old martins
getting on doavn-town  
the name of martin hoffman



   er-what dear

   i say i wonder whether martins
going to weather the storm for the gal-
pin outfit the brother mused i
doubt it like the dickens 

  there was no answer martin had
been too thoroughly discussed and his
prospects in the last few weeks had been
too gloomy to allow of much specula-
tion

   im going to call him up and sur-
prise him  richard hoffman an-
nounced

	he walked to the telephone and
asked for the galpin companys num-
ber he waited a little and suddenly
asked to be connected with mr martin
hoffmans office and

   mr hoffman is not here to-day 
the companys central informed him

   eh

   no sir he hasnt been down

   are you sure  richard swallowed
a little

  yes sir

   well send some one to mr stound
and ask again

  he waited once more and presently
he caught his breath

   mr stound says that he isnt there
and that it is the first time in twenty
years he hasnt been on hand before
nine 

  yes sir

   then-well leave word for him
that his brother called up if he should
happen to come in within the next hour
good-by

  he hung up the receiver and turned
to his wife with somewhat startled eyes

   mart isnt down at the office he
announced  and they havent had any
word from him i-hang it he must
vje ill im going to see

  he shot out of the suite and to that
other floor where martin hoffman
abode he was back in a matter of five
minutes with new information

   the room-maid says martin wasnt
there last night and that his bed hasnt
been disturbed  he announced rather
wildly

  well he may have taken a notion
to go off somewhere for a little relaxa-
tion his wife said gently  he cer-
tainly needs it badly enough dear

   maybe he does but martin never

 -	went off at such a time as this unless
 some one chloroformed him  replied
 martins brother  im going down to
 the office and find out what struck
 him 

   the elevator within a very few sec-
 onds landed him before the desk of the
 hotel and mr hoffman the elder came
 straight to the point with

    was my brother here last night 
 dickson

   the clerk stared open-mouthed

    why-er-yes sir

   well where is he now

     i cant tell that mr hoffman
    why not

    because i dont know

    the elder brother did a little staring
 himself

    well have you gone crazy dickson
 or have i   he inquired  what the
 deuce became of martin he hasnt
 left on a wild carouse has he you
 didnt notice any signs of intoxica-
 tion or-

     certainly not sir but-
 inexplicable emotion seemed to have
 choked the clerk

    well what  the inquirer de-
 manded rather violently  what in
 thunder has happened here anyway
  if you will just step inside sir
 suggested the clerk with a studied gen-
 tle compassion

   hoffman went through the gate brisk-
 ly and took a chair to the rear of the
 enclosure beside the big safe the
 clerk with a final glance about the de-
 serted lobby followed him and dragged
 another to his side

    do you mean to say mr hoffman
 he said very earnestly  that you are
 not here before you were due because
 they sent for you  

    they 

    why the gentlemen of course
 your brother and the rest

    i certainly havent heard from mar-
 tin-that is in any spectacular way such
 as you seem to suggest

    not your brother martin sir your
 brother john

   mr richard hoffman stared at him
 for a full minute then his summary
 came forth with a characteristic and
 cheerful frankness

    you let it alone dickson-the


the argosy

booze or tbe pills or the pipe or what-
ever it is he remarked soothingly  i
thought you looked funny when we first
came in i never owned a brother by
name of john my boy you-

   but your brother john was here last
night he was the one who took your
other brother away sir 

   took him where 

   thats more than i can say there
were a number of gentlemen up-stairs
there was one they called  judge sir
and three or four that they called
 doctor and thei-

   and then   cut in richard with
dazed patience

   and then they all went away to-
gether in one of those taximeter auto-
mobiles and mr martin has not been
back since nor any of the rest of
them 

  the elder hoffman licked his lips
dickson is this straight he in-
quired

   its just as the night-clerk told me
sir im sure he wasnt mistaken

   and my brother was taken away
last night

   yes sir and the night-man said
that he didnt seem himself at all he
said he was talking very wildly and say-
ing that he was blind and that he made
a good deal of resistance when they put
him in the machine

   yes ill bet he did if he didnt
want to go but- oh see here this
is all too darned absurd where did the
cab come from

   the stand right across the way sir
i heard them call it just before i went
off my watch

and where did they tell it to go
 i havent any idea of that sir the
only thing i know is that your brother
is gone and that we havent heard a
word of him since

  the elder man reflected for perhaps
a minute then he rose suddenly and
shot through the gate and across the
looby and out of the hotel

  very abruptly it had been borne in
upon him that something distinctly un-
usual had happened to martin and he
had decided to delve into the mystery at
once

  he made for the cab-stand and was
greeted with enthusiasm by the man next

                                                             

in line experience suggested a gentle
bribe hoffman thrust a small bill into
the persons hand and came straight to
business with

   were you on duty here last night 

   no sir

  well do you know who was

  no sir but i know they aint
now grinned the metered chauffeur

   why not 

   because the whole seven that was
on here last night was fired when they
brought back their cars theyd been
fixing the taximeters sir finished the
driver

  are you sure of that hoffman
asked rather breathlessly

   its the talk o the whole bunch
sir

   then-

  the inquirer turned suddenly and hur-
ried away in the cigar-store on the
opposite corner there was a telephone-
booth and he made for it and looked
up the number of the cab company

  he had the connection very shortly
and the superintendent of the establish-
ment as well-and he learned nothing

  the man had been quite right the
whole  seven at that particular station
had been discharged on their return last
evening no the superintendent did not
know the address of one of them or
where they had been during the night
for that matter

  he knew only that they seemed to
have been a downright bad lot and that
this company proposed to maintain hon-
est rates and that any member of the
employed force who sought to violate
rules would be discharged on the instant
his derelictions were discovered

  the elder hoffman hung up the re-
ceiver wearily

  his brother had been carried off in
an unknown cab by an unknown collec-
tion of men to an unknown place

  it was absurd it was outrageous
it was furthermore incredible for in
the present crisis of the galpin affairs
martin would no more have thought
of deserting business than he wrould
have essayed a flight through the air
and-hoffman took up the telephone
once more and called up his wife across
the street and informed her that he was
bound for the galpin office
the name of martin hoffman



  over the galpin establishment a sort
of dazed calm seemed to rest he asked
the boy at the door where mr hoffman
could be found he was informed that
mr hoffman had not been down to
business that day but that he could see
mr stound the infant blinked con-
fusedly-and the elder hoffman walked
to the back of the store and straight
through the  private  treasurers door

  the place was just as he had left it
a month or two ago save that the desk
was closed and that there was a pile of
unopened personal letters on the out-
drawn arm-rest

  with a grunt he settled into martins
own chair and stared about - until his
eye lit upon the button which was con-
nected with stounds office on the im-
pulse he leaned forward and pressed it

  steps came with a rush formality
forgotten the door was burst open sud-
denly  and stound with a remarkable
change of expression wras standing be-
fore him and muttering

   god bless me sir i thought it was
your brother sir i- dear me  
where is my brother stound
hoffman demanded

   well i-hes not here sir ive-
been expecting him every minute this
blessed day sir and its getting late in
the afternoon now and there aint a sign
of him

  wheres he gone then the
elder hoffman leaned forward earnest-
ly  certainly youd know if any one
did stound was there any business to
take him out of town

   no sir the old man looked at
the floor

   wasnt he well then  

   he seemed so

   well did he seem at all indisposed
yesterday  

   he-he seemed a bit tired out sir
and no wonder thats all i know
the visitor studied him with very
deep interest for rather more than a
minute then he straightened up with
 my dear stound this isnt a melo-
drama you know you neednt stand
there with that long face and work your
fingers and snort under your beard as
if you were concealing state secrets if
youve got anything to tell or anything
to suggest-out with it 

  the old man started a trifling hesi-
tation and he closed the door and
turned to the visitor

   god help me sir  he said fervent-
ly  youll forgive me before i say
it - but somehow it seems to be my
duty sir

   eh 

  yesterday sir a gentleman came
here and said that hed loan the com-
pany money enough to carry it through
the trouble sir-you know all about
that

   yes

   and after hed gone the manager
hurried on  another gentleman came
and he said that if mr hoffman-your
brother - wouldnt be here to sign the
necessary papers hed give him fifteen
thousand dollars in cash to disappear
for a week that is

 and

   and i understand your brother had
him kicked out of the place sir 

   which was thoroughly like him 
the elder hoffman commented  how
dyou happen to know all about it  

   well to tell the truth sir i was
listening at the door for just a minute
 and this morning when my brother
didnt turn up you concluded imme-
diately that he had met the other man
outside and closed with the offer

   heaven forbid sir i-

   all right ill take your word for
it now what do you know about his
whereabouts at present  

  no more than i do about where ill
be mvself a hundred years from now
sir

  the visitor considered again and
when he looked up it was with a rather
hard smile

   its apparent that my ordinarily
well-balanced brother has elected to
drop out of sight altogether for the
time he observed just tell that
telephone central of yours to give me
delafields detective agency and get
mr howard delafield on the wire 

chapter vii

through three doors

  for the moment martin hoffman
stood transfixed with amazement


the argosy

  for the moment too a little chill
ran through him and his head began
to feel a trifle doubtful and then out
of the blackness before him the voice
came again intoning

   wonderful and mighty king we
hail thee

  the blind man stopped short it was
a joke of some sort doubtless a joke
perpetrated by some one who didnt real-
ize that he was sightless

   pardon me he said with a faint
smile but im not just the subject for
a practical joke i am stone-blind

   all hail king solomon  the voice
went on impressively

  the wanderer moistened his lips

   am i supposed to be king solo-
mon he inquired mildly

   great king the nations of the earth
bow down before thee  the voice went
on monotonously see majesty i
beat my head upon the ground before
thee i call aloud-

   then please stop calling aloud 
hoffman said rather sharply  im
blind i tell you whatever the idea is
please give it up i cant see it or you
and i cant appreciate it at all where
are you anyway 

   lo king i lie before thee 

   then please get up drop your con-
founded farce and tell me the way out
of this place i want to get a breath
of air and-

  a sharp intake of breath greeted him
and a horrified

   oh incomparable solomon thus
would you leave even the humblest of
your subjects in this the first moment
that you have appeared through all the
centuries thus must i be cast back
into the unhallowed gloom endured for
so many years before your coming 
thus must i-

  a j

   for i have indeed waited long and
patiently lord  the voice continued to
plead  i have waited and prayed
that you might return and reveal your-
self  and now you have at last deigned
to come and you would go as quickly
ah no lord i beseech thee that-

   shut up  cut in hoffman rather
inelegantly

  the voice had risen altogether too
high for complete comfort and hoffman

expected every moment to hear the sound
of footsteps in the corridor instead
a dismal wail answered him with

   lo king i obey though my heart
turn to ashes and be melted in the bit-
terness of ages  my voice is dead my
lips are as stone 

   then let them stay so for a while 
snapped the blind man  im frank to
admit that i dont see the point of it
and if its supposed to be a joke its
deuced bad taste to say the very least
but if youre not going to get up and
pilot me out of here for heavens sake
have sense enough not to raise that row 

  he seemed to have been taken liter-
ally 

  from the room before him came never
a sound save the groans of some one
apparently near the floor

  for an endless space as it seemed
hoffman waited for further develop-
ments

  none apparently were to come for
silence reigned-and presently the chilly
sensations began to run up and down his
backbone once more

  there was something uncanny about
all this-something too uncanny for en-
durance in his present state he wanted
to get out of the place he wanted to
get down-town to his office he wanted
to find thomas by telephone and have
him back and have the deal closed
before the end of the days banking
hours he wanted to see the ridgkin
people considerably before three and
have matters settled in full

  and he turned abruptly to the spot
where the door must be in a happy
instant he found it and felt his way
through

  he stepped into the corridor quickly
and drew the door closed and a sorrow-
ful voice floated after with

   great and merciless majesty the
humblest of thy servants awaits with
chastened spirit thy next coming
though my spirit groan and my heart
bleed though the ages come and go
and nations rise and fall again still will
i-

  the door snapped sharply and the
sound was deadened to a wordless mut-
tering

  hoffman drew a great breath and
pressed a hand to his eyes
the name of martin hoffman



  was he crazy or was that other indi-
vidual  or was it all an extremely poor
joke perpetrated by some convalescent
of the place

  for the instant his over-tried brain
took to its tricks of unsteadiness again
and he was unable to determine defi-
nitely with something of an effort
he threw off the recollection of the
whole affair as far as possible

  it was time for him to go on and find
his way out even if he had to attempt
the descent of a fire-escape in the dark-
ness that surrounded him

  hed do it too and take his chances
and-there was another door at his hand

  for a little he felt over it it was
much like the former perhaps it would
lead to nothing whatever perhaps it
was the exit to a rear stairway-or some-
thing of the sort

  he felt on and on and his hand en-
countered a bolt on the hall side of the
door hoffman started joyfully this
looked promising the entrance to a
stairway perhaps or-he slid back the
bolt and tried the door

  it opened with beautiful ease the
wanderer thrust one foot forward and
felt his way the floor wras entirely
solid he advanced another yard and
found only level carpet he tried again
and felt about with his arms he seemed
to be in another room now

  confusedly cursing his blindness he
felt farther to either side there was
nothing solid to be encountered well
hed turn around and get out and look
further for escape and-

   it is certainly high time you turned
up dansten  said a thin cracked
voice some few feet before jiim

  the blind man stopped short

   what

   i say its certainly high time that
you put in an appearance dansten 
the sharp tones repeated  why havent
you been here before what

  hoffman choked down the amazed
question that was in his throat there
was something here altogether beyond
his understanding for the present

  hed have to take these little pleasant-
ries in the spirit in which they wrere ad-
vanced whatever that might be he
tried to smile and a vague flicker of
mirth came over his lips

   i-er-was delayed  he announced
shakily

 delayed were you humph
the voice seemed to have grown more
irascible and the visitor catalogued it
suddenly as that of a rather elderly man
 well youre here now anyway i
hope youve come for business

   i-er-yes 

    i-er-yes   quoted the unseen
hades your father never wabbled
around with any  i-er-yes  my boy
he was a man that knew the law business
from one end to the other 

 of course assented hoffman
dazedly

   and youll be like him all in due
time the thin voice continued with a
little kindlier accent  sit down 

   if-if youll show me a chair  sug-
gested the visitor  im blind

   blind  the voice rose to an
astounded scream pattering footsteps
came toward hoffman and he felt that
some one was staring at him  well
ill be hanged boy here sit here
now gently thats right down
there 

  thin fingers clutched the visitors
arms and he was lowered into a com-
fortable armchair for a minute or so
he waited expectantly then with a
creaking of a willow chair somewhere
across the room he heard

   you havent brought the papers of
course 

   why-no 

   i thought not i thought not i
thought not youre so devilish unt
dependable horace your father would
have had them with him and all made
out in proper form-and after my wait-
ing all these months to see you too
well-bah 

  hoffman moistened his lips and tried
to smile again

   you - er - see it was unavoidable
this time he explained thickly  i-
 unavoidable unavoidable why
should you allow anything unavoidable
to enter into a case as important as
mine the person demanded dont
you know horace-dont you know pos-
itively-that just as soon as we put my
claim before any judge the whole ninety-
seven millions are going to be awarded
to me by the courts dont you know


the argosy

that i am going to give you personally
forty millions in cash as soon as we get
the decision dont you understand that
youre not working for nothing even if
my relatives have brought me here to
italy and shut me up in this confounded
villa what

   of course  hoffman agreed

   then why dont you collect the
money the voice rasped why do
you come aroundhere and tell me you
havent the papers ready why do you
boggle everything and try to excuse
yourself and all that sort of rot 
well i-

   look here  the voice grew an-
grier  ill tell you one thing thatll
bring a blush to your cheeks yesterday
a man came in here-a colored man-
one of the servants of the palace or
whatever it is he came in here merely
to sweep mind you i looked at him
and i saw that he was intelligent i ex-
plained the whole matter to him and
asked him if he could attend to it and
if he would he agreed then i gave
him five cents for a retainer and he said
he would attend to everything he said
hed go to america at once and be back
here with the money inside of two days
just as i asked him there what do
you think of that and you supposed
to be one of the leading lawyers in new
york bali 

  with a gasp hoffman was  his feet
 ill tell you what ill do he said
swiftly and rather chokingly  ill go
straight back and get the papers and
have you sign them and ill have the
money here for you before that colored
man possibly can is that satisfactory 
he turned toward the door and felt
his way a thin hand came down on
his shoulder and patted it-and a new
series -of chills ran through hoffman
as a gratefully lachrymose voice squeaked
into his ear

   spoken like your father my boy
spoken like your father now youre
beginning to talk business go and
get my air-ship its tied to the left-
hand chimney on the roof tell the
engineer to take you straight to trinity
church new york and-good-by my
boy 

  ilie treasurer of the galpin company
was through the door and had closed

it after him with fingers that were
growing in intelligence by the second
he found the bolt and jammed it back
into place-and for an instant he stood
and breathed hard

  that poor devil was as mad as a
march hare about that last fact there
could be never the shade of a doubt

  and the realization gave biting point
to another horrible suspicion that had
been floating through his mind for some
five minutes was he in a lunatic
asylum 

  on the face of it it seemed incredible
and yet-well there were people in the
place altogether too queer for comfort-
able association and he must get out
and find his way home and-ah

  here was another and smaller door
he felt about it carefully he felt
farther and found what seemed to be
a turn in the hall or a solid wall

  at all events this door was consider-
ably narrower and-yes it was bolted
too this must be the back stairway
and perhaps it led to the street and
perhaps he could-

  he shoved back the bolt and tried
the third knob it gave way and hands
outstretched once more he hurried for-
ward into the endless purposeless space
before his blind eyes

  a dozen feet and hoffman leaped
back instinctively for out of the gloom
had issued a wild animal-like snarl

  for all resemblance to human sound
it might have been a tiger or a lion
on the other hand there was a queer
savage quality that resembled a demented
mans voice and - hoffman was flat
upon the floor

  strong wiry hands following the
crash of a chair or a table had gripped
him so suddenly that resistance was out
of the question not altogether ignorant
of wrestling he let go of his muscles
and landed without a bruise-and as
swiftly he had bounced back to his feet
and was reaching wildly around in the
darkness

  the snarl came again and with it a
rushing of light feet the hands fol-
lowed too and all but had his throat
again and the treasurer of the galpin
company found himself engaged on the
second in furious conflict

  at the mildest it was a wild sort of
when the clock stops



business and one in which palpably
he must fight or be thrashed-and per-
haps killed he caught himself in a
wild desire to scream for help and put
all his mind to fighting the unseen thing
that was straining at him

  silently pantingly they gripped hard
the others fingers slipped and came
again to hoffmans neck he caught
at the wrists and secured them with
wonderful alertness he forced them
down and back he managed even by
releasing the one to turn the other very
suddenly behind his demented antago-
nists back

  he shut his teeth and thrust out a
leg-and the invisible fighter was down
upon his face for the moment and
struggling like a wild man he was
rising too despite the well-held  ham-
merlock   in just a minute if he main-
tained his strength he was going to be
on top of hoffman with every prospect
of choking him to death

  and indeed what with years of desk
work hoffman felt himself giving out
rapidly and-the door crashed - back to
the wall and other steps were racing
toward the strugglers

  there was an instant of furious pant-
ing there was a sudden tremendous
relief as the form was dragged away
from him

  there was an abrupt jerk as hoffman
was yanked bodily to his feet by two
pairs of hands and raced forward

  and they were apparently out in the
corridor now-and now they were tear-
ing along the hall-and now he was
hurled headlong upon a bed and hands
were holding him down

  he tried to protest his voice choked
for an instant and then before he could
speak the no longer gentle tones of
smith growled breathlessly into his ear

   the next time you try that trick
youll get vour skull cracked - hear
that 

   say for a blind mans- home- came
in a roar from hoffman

   this-aint any blind mans home
bill  the snarl informed him viciously
 this is dr blatchfords private asylum
for the insane-and if you aint less
buggy hereafter youll get a jab of
morphine thatll make you think youve
dropped into the atlantic lie down
there 

                            to be continued

when the clock stops

               by howard dwight smiley

                   how the inventor with a grudge got even with
                   those who had turned the cold shoulder to him

elihu brooks inventor stormed
furiously around the private office
of the president of the acme air-brake
company

   whose invention put you where you
are he demanded

   yours admitted the president with
an air of patient resignation	

   and youve made over a million out
of it aint you 

   something around that figure i be-
lieve the president again admitted

   well then it seems mighty curious
that you cant invest five thousand in my
top why sir it is the most remarkable
top ever invented spins for two hours

did you ever hear of a top that would
spin for two hours you never did if
i can get that top on the market it will
sell like hot cakes every man woman
and child in the world will want one
and they will retail at a dollar each too
seems to me that in view of the fact that
i made your old company what it is you
might finance this thing for me

   but mr brooks the president gen-
tly remonstrated  we bought your patent
outright and paid you cash for it i
cant see where we are under any obliga-
tions to you your top may be a good
thing but it doesnt look practical to
me i dont believe you can get anybody


the argosy

to invest a dollar in a toy just because it
will spin for two hours who wants to
see a top spin for two hours your
proposition is altogether too foolish for
my consideration and as i am very busy
just now i will bid you good morning
without a word mr brooks snatched
up his top from the desk and stalked an-
grily from the office

  in turn he visited the offices of the
new process brass company the briggs
fire appliance company the gauss au-
tomobile brake company and half a
dozen other concerns in a fruitless en-
deavor to raise funds to finance his top

  at all of these places he was received
with due respect for indeed it was to
the products of his fertile brain that each
of them owed its existence however
none of them could see their way clear
to invest five thousand dollars in mr
brookss top

   then ill finance it myself he said
angrily as he strode out of the last office
 i know its a winner and ill make a
fortune out of it you see if i dont
now mr brooks lacking the in-
stinct that makes men successful in a
business way had never before attempted
to finance one of his inventions but had
always been satisfied to sell his patents
outright for cash the products of his
genius had made millions for other men
but the inventor himself was in compara-
tively poor circumstances

  true he owned a beautiful home sur-
rounded by spacious grounds the value
of which was estimated at not less than
thirty thousand dollars he also owned
a large store-building oil the main street
of the town but as this had stood empty
for several years it brought him no in-
come outside of these he was practi-
cally penniless a

  nevertheless with absolute confidence
in the success of his enterprise mr
brooks mortgaged his home for five thou-
sand dollars installed the necessary ma-
chinery in his empty store-building em-
ployed several helpers and set about
manufacturing tops

  at the end of two months the inventor
had ten thousand tops finished boxed
and ready for shipment and had used up
the entire five thousand dollars then
he suddenly discovered that he had made

no provisions for advertising and mar-
keting his stock

  reluctant to further mortgage his
home he again made a round of his
friends in a fruitless endeavor to raise
funds as before they received him
kindly but they were all of the private
opinion that the old gentleman had be-
come weak-minded in his old age and
they declined to risk a dollar in his enter-
prise whereat the irate inventor vowed
dire vengeance on all of them and pre-
pared to plaster another mortgage  his
home

  before he could do this however mr
brooks was taken suddenly and serious-
ly ill

when dr harmon arrived and exam-
ined the old gentleman he looked very
grave and sent a messenger for drs
evans and grant

  after a thorough examination and a
long private consultation in the next
room the physician returned and informed
the patient that he was afflicted with an
incurable disease and had less than a
month to live

   mr brooks avas at first stunned by this
intelligence but the philosophy of the
genius was his and he quickly bacame
reconciled to his fate and set about pre-
paring for the end with the same cool
deliberation that had marked all his ac-
tions throughout his career he expressed
but one regret-that he could not live
long enough to get even avith the men
avho had grown rich through his inven-
tions and had refused him aid in his
hour of need

  for a week he did little except lie
quietly apparently buried in deep thought
and contemplation then one day his
housekeeper heard him calling excitedly
when she reached his side she found the
old gentleman sitting up in bed his face
filled with elation

    ive got em  he cried exultantly
 ive got em  

  for the lands sake gasped the
good avoman  youve got avhat

   them answered the inventor enig-
matically  i want you to send for laav-
yer patterson right off im going to
make my will

   humph   sniffed the housekeeper
 i cant see avhy you should make such a
when the clock stops



  fuss over that i thought you were having
  a fit and she flounced indignantly from
  the room

    mr patterson arrived shortly after-
  ward and remained closeted with his
  client for three hours the housekeeper
  was called in once to witness the signing
  of the will and then dismissed again
  and when the lawyer finally emerged
  from the room he had a number of
  papers in his hand and a grim sardonic
  smile on his countenance

    he appeared to be much amused over
  something but made no comments

    and the next day elihu brooks died

ii

    when the contents of the will were
  made public everybody in cerescosat up
  and wondered it was a most remarkable
  will those who had suspicioned that
  the old inventors mind had become weak-
  ened before his death wgre now con-
  vinced that they had made a correct sur-
  mise

    clyde brooks a young grofcery clerk
  of the town nephew and only surviving
  refative of the inventor was made the
  sole heir with certain restrictions and
  conditions to wit

    he was to take immediate possession
  of the home and store he was to oc-
  cupy the former until its disposal as set
  forth in the will

    he was then to take the large swiss

	clock which stood in mr brookss study
  and place it in the show-window of the
  store so that it could be plainly seen from
  the street

    he was then to announce in the town
  papers that on a certain date he would
  place on sale ten thousand tops the in-
  vention of the late elihu brooks and
  would dispose of them as follows

    the price of each top would be one
  dollar and each sale would entitle the
  purchaser to one guess as to what hour
  and minute the clock would stop these
  guesses were to be registered in their
  order and in case two or more contest-
  ants guessed the correct time the one
  registering his guess first would be the
  winner of the contest

   the prize to the winne was mr
 brookss tlnrty-thousand-dollar home

      a

  w hen clyde read these conditions he
made an indignant and vigorous protest

   why uncle elihu must have been
crazy when he drew up that will he de-
clared to lawyer patterson  i wont
stand for any such proceeding it isnt
legal ill break the will

   you couldnt do that the lawyer
informed him  your uncle was privi-
leged to dispose of his property an he saw
fit i helped him draw up the papers
and i know that it is all perfectly legal
but you go ahead and do as he wishes
youll be satisfied in the end

   it took the lawyer the best part of two
hours to convince the young man that he
could not do other than follow out his
uncles wishes but in the end clyde
yielded to his arguments and agreed to
follow mr brookss instructions to the
letter and accept whatever the transaction
yielded

  therefore the next morning clyde in-
stalled the clock in the store-window
and inserted advertisements in the two
local papers announcing that the sale of
the tops and the guessing contest would
start promptly at seven oclock the fol-
lowing monday morning

  the result was astonishing the town
became immediately filled with excite-
ment crowds gathered before the store-
window to view the clock while others
besieged clyde and mr patterson to
learn if the report was really true and
legal

  on being assured that it was they at
once lapsed into a deep and silent reflec-
tion in an earnest endeavor to figure out
just at what minute the clock would be
liable to stop

  the prize was a beautiful old stone
mansion ideally situated on a long slo-
ping hill overlooking crystal lake and
surrounded by stately old oaks it had
long been the envy of the wealthier resi-
dents of the town many of whom had
made efforts to buy it but without avail
as the late owner had refused to sell at
any price

  therefore when the opportunity pre-
sented itself to them to become the pos-
sessor of the property through the process
of merely guessing when a clock would
stop at the rate of one dollar a guess
everybody started guessing


the argosy

   clyde reached his store at five-thirty
monday morning to get it in readiness
for the rush he anticipated however
early as it was he found the president of
the acme air-brake company already
there and waiting for him

  how long have you been here
asked clyde noting the tired expression
on the others face

    since midnight answered the presi-
dent  i was determined to get the first
crack at this guessing contest

   clyde opened the store and the presi-
dent promptly made a purchase of one
thousand four hundred and forty tops
and registered his guesses one for each
minute of the twenty-four hours

    there he remarked as he finished
 ill bet ive got that place cinched now
and at a mighty cheap price too why

i offered brooks thirty-five thousand for
it less than a year ago and he refused

    of course you understand that there
is a five-thousand-dollar mortgage on the
place clyde reminded him

    i dont care anything about that
ill have it lifted within twenty-four
hours after the clock stops and will be
moved into the house inside of a week

    it was a rather mean trick to play on
you though he added kindly to clyde
 the sale of the tops wont bring you a
third of what the home is worth of
course its easy to see what your uncles
scheme was he was very angry because
we refused to advance him money to
finance his tops and he thinks he is get-
ting even by makng us buy them well
im perfectly willing to do so with the
inducements he offers

  at this point the president of the
new process brass company  arrived
the first president greeted him deri-
sively

    youre too late jones he laughed
 ive got this game cinched already

   oh i dont know answered jones
 howd you guess 

    i began at twelve noon and made
a guess for every minute of the twenty-
four hours

   well that dont necesarilv win the
contest grunted jones turning to
clyde and pulling out his check-book
 you can send fourteen hundred and
forty tops around to my house and put

me down for an equal number of guesses
starting at one half minute past twelve
and putting in the half minutes for the
full twenty-four hours the seconds
count  presume  

   certainly answered clyde

  more top customers began to arrive
and the two presidents returned to their
homes

  by noon the trade had grown so brisk
that clyde had to call in help to assist
him in passing out the packages when
he closed the store for the night he
found that he had disposed of nearly
five thousand tops

  most of these had gone to the wealthy
manufacturers of the town who had
bought them up in lots of five hundred
or more

  the next day the trade was not so
brisk the heavy guessing of the weal-
thier class had frightened off many of
the poorer people who saw that they
had little chance of winning however
clyde disposed of nearly one thousand
tops and registered an equal number
of guesses by the end of the week he
had less than five hundred tops on hand

  then lawyer patterson who had been
an interested but silent watcher of the
proceedings handed clyde a letter ad-
dressed to him in his uncles handwriting

   a week from to-day i will hand you
another and last letter of instruction
from your uncle he informed the young
man

  clyde opened the letter and read the
following	

  my dear nephew

     i presume you have by now disposed
  of the bulk of my beloved tops and if
  i guessed right when i thought out this
  schcme for getting rid of them most
  of them have been gobbled up by the
  scalawags who have become rich through
  my inventions and turned me down
  when i most needed their help

     now my boy the first thing i want
  you to do is to wind up the clock and
  if any of the guessers object inform
  them that you have wound it for the
  last time

    next take as much as is necessary
  from the proceeds from the sale of the
  tops and pay off the mortgage on the
  house be sure to have that clear first
  of all

     then i want you to send a draft for
when the clock stops



  two thousand five hundred dollars to
  the jonesville grocery company jones-
  ville michigan mr patterson has
  written them and they will understand
  as soon after receiving the draft as
  possible they will ship you by freight a
  complete stock of groceries wtiich you
  are to install in the store-your store-
  and then open up for business you
  ought to be successful as you have al-
  ready jiad considerable experience in
  this line and now my boy rest quietly
  until a week from to-day when i will
  give you niy final instructions and be-
  lieve me

your affectionate uncle

	elihu brooks

  when clyde read that he felt that
he had another grievance

   now see here mr patterson he
remonstrated  the money ive received
from the sale of those tops ought to
belong to me if i pay off that mortgage
it will take over half of it i cant see
any reason why i should pay it let
the one who wins the contest do that
what are you kicking about an-
swered patterson  youve got a full-
fledged grocery stock and over two thou-
sand dollars in cash left havent- you
you just trust your uncle and do what
he tells you to and youll lie satisfied-
take my word for that

  clyde was far from satisfied how-
ever he had wanted that home and
had lost it and now that he was com-
pelled to pay off the mortgage he felt
that his uncle was rubbing it in a little
harder than was necessary

  nevertheless he followed out the in-
structions promptly the mortgage was
paid next day and the draft despatched
and by the middle of the week the
stock of groceries arrived and were
quickly installed in the store

 when he looked them over and con-
sidered the matter his bitter feelings
toward his deceased uncle softened a
little

  perhaps after all he was better off
than he would have been if his uncle
had simply willed him the home and
store for in that case he would have
had a five-thousand-dollar mortgage to
pay and would not have had a cent to
pay it with and nothing left to start up
business

  as he stood now he was free from
debt had a first-class grocery store and
a substantial bank-account yes after
all perhaps it was for the best

  as the weeks end drew near large
crowds gathered in front of the store
to watch the clock and speculate on
when it would stop clyde had dis-
posed of the last of his tops two days
before the guesses were all in and it
was now merely a matter of waiting
until the timepiece ran down

  saturday came and with it mr pat-
terson with the final letter of instruc-
tions from clydes uncle when that
young man acquainted himself with the
contents he nearly fainted from aston-
ishment the letter read

 my dear nephew

    if i guess right you have by now dis-
  posed of the last of the tops and my re-
  vdjiige is complete

    you are by this time fully settled in
  your new grocery-store and have plenty
  of cash with which to carry on the busi-
  ness i hope that you will be success-
  ful and that in time you will marry
  some nice girl and go to live in the old
  home-for of course you are to occupy
  that until the clock stops

    the case for that clock was imported
  from switzerland but the works are my
  own invention which i have never pat-
  ented or offered for sale when you
  wound up the clock a week ago to-day
  you did so for the first time it has been

	wound in twelve years-and it is now
  wound up to run for one century

   wishing you much success and hap-
  piness i am -

your affectionate uncle

author of  the jailbird  when a mans hungry  the isle of mysteries etc

        certain thrilling experiences that befell two army men and a sailor after they
        had left the service and looked forward to a peaceful civilian existence

synopsis of chapters previously published

    frank leffingwell and a randolph arriving ii new york from the philippines
fall in with a sailor simon semple also just discharged the three men pool their money
which together with their discharge papers is stolen that evening from leffingwells pocket
they are accosted by a young woman who asks their protection from a man who is fol-
lowing her the man attempting to pass them is knocked down by randolph and taken
to the hospital with a fractured skull

    randolph is arrested and his two friends leave him in jail to try to procure legal
help seeing in a paper an advertisement offering five thousand dollars for the capture
of a man named mitchell a deserter from leffingwells regiment they determine to earn
the reward semple traces to the gondola apartment house on riverside drive the
young woman of their adventure whose testimony they want in randolphs behalf mean-
while leffingwell interviews the writer of the advertisement a mr addison who also
lives at the gondola apartments he learns that addisons ward is in love with the
deserter who addison believes is planning to marry her for the fortune which is to be
hers on her birthday next month addison promises to put his own lawyer on randolphs
case if leffingwell will aid him in capturing mitchell

    that night as he leaves the gondola leffingwell chances to notice a light flashed in
signal from the jersey shore and answered from the windows of the apartment-house he
and semple row across the river where they trace the light to a little shack as they
approach the hut a bulldog rushes upn them and fastens his teeth in semples leg at
the same time two armed men one of whom is mitchell run from the hut and force them
to put up their hands 

chapter xiii

the tables turned

mitchells companion gave a
sharp command to the bulldog
and the latter with evident reluctance
relinquished his hold on simple simons
leg and walked over to his master
grumbling and growling as though in
protest against this order

  leffingwell greatly to his surprise
then noticed for the first time that the
man was a chinaman-a one-eyed china-
man who wore clothes of american
style and had discarded his pigtail

  his amazement at this discovery was
cut short by the voice of mitchell

   so its you my dear friend lef-
fingwell is it sneered the deserter
 why this is indeed a great and glad-
some surprise i cant tell you how de-
lighted i am to see you its so pleasant

	began march argosy

 to have ones friends drop in unexpected-
 ly you know 

    by the way let me introduce my
 good friend  mr beem nomm low
 wing i believe you and your red-
 headed friend have already met now
 that were all properly acquainted we
 can converse without restraint i trust
 that you and your friend are prepared to
 take off your hats and stay a while my
  dear leffingwell 

   the latter scowled

    i wish youd cut out this cheap sar-
 casm and get down to business he
 growled  i dont know what you in-
 tend to do with us but whatever it is
 hurry up and do it thats all i ask
 of you

    now dont be impatient my dear
 leffingwell said the deserter in a mock
 tone of reproach  to be quite candid
 with you im a little puzzled to know
 single copies  cents

 n
wanted by uncle sam	

-	just what to do with you i dont
 exactly relish the idea of killing you
 and yet i really dont see what other
 course is open to-me

    pooh   exclaimed leffingwell con-
 temptuously  were not afraid that
 youre going to kill us youre too much
 of a coward mitchell to run the risk
 of going to the electric-chair

    oh really i dont think thered be
 very much risk of that the deserter
 retorted smoothly  i could put a bullet
 into your head and into the red head of
 your friend here and thered be nobody
 to bear witness against me my friend
 beem nomm low here is too loyal to
 betray me and of course the bulldog
 cant talk i guess i can put an end to
 the pair of you very nicely without run-
 ning any danger of going to the chair
 for it

    but you wont do it declared lef-
 fingwell confidently  i know your
 caliber too well mitchell to be afraid
 of you you havent got enough nerve
 to do anything like that

    it isnt exactly prudent of you to
 talk in that manner the deserter re-
 torted if you set any value on your
 life and the life of your friend you
 should not question my courage you
 know it isnt good policy your words
 almost tempt me to pull this trigger-
 just to prove to you that i have got the
 nerve

    and i tell you again that you darent
 do it cried leffingwell with a defiant
 recklessness which caused simple simon
 to glance at him in surprise and trepi-
 dation

    whether youve got the nerve or
 not the latter hastened to interpose
 addressing mitchell  im sure you
 wouldnt murder us in cold blood you
 dont want to forget that we had you in
 our power earlier to-day and were merci-
 ful enough to let you go one good
 turn deserves another you know

   simple simon was no coward but life
 was dear to him and he did not see the
 sense of throwing it away out of mere
 bravado not knowing mitchells char-
 acter as well as leffingwell knew it he
 did not share the latters positiveness that
 the deserter was too much lacking in
 courage to make good his threat

    i assure you that i have not for-

 gotten that favor my red-headed friend
 mitchell replied  but on the other
 hand i havent forgotten the emphatic
 kick with which our dear friend lef-
 fingwell sent me speeding on my way
 the recollection of that kick sort of
 takes away my gratitude besides i
 have since learned that my dear leffing-
 well has paid a visit to my sweetheart
 and tried to blacken my character in her
 eyes

   true he did not succeed but never-
theless i bear him a grudge for it as
shakespeare remarks  he who steals
my purse steals trash  but he who robs
me of my good name etc etc

   however that is not the point it
is not for the sake of revenge that i feel
constrained to kill you both but merely
as a matter of self-protection

   i very much fear that your object
in coining here now was not to pay me
a social call but to seize me and hand
me over to tbe authorities in order to
earn that big reward now of course
i cant afford to let you do that my
liberty is very dear to me and i dont
relish the idea of languishing in a mili-
tary prison

  therefore the question presents it-
self what am i going to do with you
if i dont kill you

  he pretended to deliberate for a full
minute during which time simple si-
mons face wore a very anxious and ap-
prehensive expression while leffingwells
under lip curled in a contemptuous
smile

   i have an idea cried the deserter
suddenly  i think i perceive a way
out of the difficulty i will have to ask
you gentlemen to be kind enough to
step inside our humble little dwelling
but first of all  must request my
friend beem nomm low to search you
both-while you continue to keep your
hands above your heads of course-in
order to make sure that you have no
weapons

  the one - eyed chinaman obediently
made a careful examination of their
pockets and reported that they carried
no arms

   very good mitchell commented
 that being the case i will not trouble
you to keep your hands up any longer
it must be an uncomfortable position


the argosy

be good enough to step this way gentle-
men

  once again leffingwell had to struggle
with a wild impulse to hurl himself upon
the deserter and endeavor to wrest his
weapon from him

  hut he cheeked himself with the rec-
ollection that mitchell although not
possessing nerve enough to shoot him
down in cold blood doubtless would
not hesitate to commit murder if it came
to a struggle he realized that a coward
is ofttimes the most dangerous of men
when rendered desperate

  and besides the one-eyed celestial
looked like a man who was prepared to
kill at the slightest provocation his
features were sinister and absolutely mer-
ciless also there was the savage bull-
dog to be reckoned with

  realizing that the odds were so greatly
against himself and simple simon lef-
fmgwell sullenly followed his companion
into the hut the bulldog snapping sav-
agely at their heels and the revolvers of
mitchell and the chinaman leveled at
their heads

  as they entered the place they saw
that it was a single-roomed structure
the interior quite as wretched as the out-
side

  the wooden walls were bare and
dirty the rough plank floor was devoid
of carpet or oilcloth and the only furni-
ture the room contained was a rusty
oil-stove a dirty looking cot-bed a small
unpolished oblong table and an old
cane chair with the seat broken and a
rung missing

   welcome my friends said mitchell
grinning as he noticed the look of sur-
prise with which leffingwell regarded
these surroundings   hope you will
be comfortable here and manage to
make yourselves thoroughly at home
for i am afraid i must ak you to tarry
here for an indefinite period

   kindly go to that closet my dear
beem nomm low and bring out the
coil of stout rope you will find there
i guess we shall be compelled to bind
these gentlemen hand and foot in order
to make sure that they do not wander
away although really they would be
very foolish to try anything of that sort
the dogs teeth are very sharp-as our
red-headed friend knows-and hell be

on the alert all the time ready to tear
them to pieces if they try to leave

  the chinaman opened the door of a
plain wooden closet and produced there-
from a coil of strong rope

  with this he securely bound the hands
and feet of leffingwell and simon so
that the unfortunate men were unable
to move a limb and then he tied them
in an upright position to two perpendic-
ular beams which supported the roof of
the structure

   very good commented mitchell
 now i guess theyre just about as
helpless as two strong men could be

  he stood regarding his impotent vic-
tims with a look of infinite satisfaction
on his dissipated face

   and now old man he continued
addressing the chinaman  i guess you
and  can leave our two friends here
while we take a trip to a safer part of
the country

   dont hesitate to make yourselves
at home gentlemen while we are gone
if there should be anything that you re-
quire in the way of food or drink just
ring for the butler and he will cheer-
fully attend to your wants

   by the way you can exercise your
voices by shouting if you wish theres
nobody for miles around to be disturbed
by it so you can yell all you want come
on beem nomm low we wont tarry
here any longer good-by leffingwell
old boy the next time we meet i hope
to be married to a charming young
woman worth two million dollars

  with a laugh he walked out of the
hut followed by the one-eyed chinaman

  as the door closed behind them sim-
ple simon looked at leffingwell despair-
ingly

   looks to me as ifwere in a pretty
bad fix he groaned  this rope is as
strong as double irons and i guess that
rascal was telling the truth when he
said that there aint anybody around to
hear our shouts

   looks to me pretty much as if were
going to be here for days and perhaps
weeks or months before anybody dis-
covers us an in the meantime we shall
perish from hunger and thirst

   by the way messmate i wonder if
that cuss was serious when he told us
that if we wanted food or drink we
wanted by uncle sam



should ring for the butler ill be jig-
gered if i cfn see any bell

chapter xiv

helpless in a hut

  in a frenzy of fury and despair lef-
fingwell tugged savagely at the ropes
which fettered his hands and feet bind-
ing him to the perpendicular beam

   taint no use doing that comrade
simple simon remarked sadly if you
was three times as strong as you are you
couldnt bust them ropes theyre too
darned strong youll only exhaust
yourself by trying it were in a bad
fix  but it aint any use getting excited
over it lets take it calm and easy
and hope that somebody will come and
rescue us before we die of starvation
if only i knew where that dirty cad
mitchell intends to go groaned leffing-
well  thats whats worrying me 
dont care about myself or what happens
to me but it makes my blood boil to think
that after our rare good luck in catching
him for the second time to-day hes
managed to slip through our hands again
what- blanked fools we were to come
here unarmed if we had carried guns
i feel confident that we could have got
the best of them

   wed have stood an even chance at
least simple simon agreed it would
have been a case of who could have fired
first i guess at any rate if id had a
gun id have put a bullet through the
ugly head of that darned bulldog the
brute didnt do a thing to my leg it
feels mighty sore where he bit me

   we bungled the whole thing dis-
gracefully growled leffingwell  we
rushed into this ambush like a couple of
blind mules  we might have suspected
that mitchell would be armed and on
his guard

   well well know better next time
remarked simple simon making an he-
roic effort to appear cheerful  its
no use worrying over whats already hap-
pened whats done cant be undone
next time queried leffingwell
fiercely  there wont be any next
time do you think we stand the ghost
of a show of catching sight of that cad
again now that he knows that were

on to the secret of this shanty he wont
be fool enough to come here any more
the chances are that lies now on his
way out of town and wont come back
to this city again until all danger is
over

    its too bad sighed simon  by
 the way messmate i wonder who owns
 this here shack-mitchell or the one-
 eyed chinaman they make a mighty
 queer pair im thinking wonder how
 the divvle they ever got together

    i dont know and i dont care
growled leffingwell  such things dont
interest me just now what  want to
know is how we can get free of these
confounded ropes and make after that
cad before he has a chance to get far
away it seems to me that with all your
experience on the seas you ought to
know enough about ropes to be able to
suggest something

    my experience on the seas teaches
 me that when a feller is lashed to a
 mast with ropes of the thickness of these
 here he stands about as much chance of
 freeing himself as a rat in a trap re-
 torted simon sadly  these knots was
 tied to stay my lad i give that there
 chink credit for knowing how to tie a
 knot that is a knot i shouldnt be sur-
 prised to learn that hes been a seaman
 at some time or other

    the only thing for us to do is to
 shout for help i guess taint likely
 that it will do us any good but we
 might as well try anyway

   they shouted in unison but the only
 response they obtained was the furious
 barking of the bulldog outside

   they could hear the savage beast
maddened by their shouts hurling his
body against the closed door of the hut
in a vain attempt to get in

    we can thank our lucky stars that
 that door is closed remarked simon
 with a shudder  bound and helpless as
 we are wed make a nice meal for that
 vicious brute if he could get to us im
 mighty thankful to them fellers for not
 leaving the door ajar

    never mind the dog leffingwell
commanded  keep on shouting if
only somebody would come along and
hear us 

    taint very likely to happen im
 afraid replied simon that deserter


the argosy

 chap said there wasnt a soul for miles
 around and i guess he told us the truth

i hope that beast aint able to climb
through that there window he added
apprehensively if he does were a
couple of goners

   he cant climb through it leffing-
well assured him  its too high from
the ground keep up the shouting
simon its our only hope

   i dont like to shout replied the
other timorously  it makes that beast
so mad listen to him howl it gives
me the willies to hear him

   pooh  exclaimed leffingwell
 theres no need to fear the dog his
howl cant do us any harm he cant
get inside

   dont be too positive of that said
simon  i aint as sure as id like to
be that he cant leap through that win-
dow id rather face ten men with
forty-eight-caliber guns in their hands
than that dog ive felt his teeth once
and id rather stay here until i die than
have him take another bite out of me
but despite his words he joined lef-
fingwell in calling for help and the
desperate pair continued to yell for half
an hour at the end of which time they
were so hoarse that tlev were compelled
to desist

   reckon it aint going to do any
good sighed simon if we were
wrecked on a desert island i guess wed
stand about as much chance of attracting
anybodys attention as we do here i
guess were up against it good and hard
old comrade and must make the best
of it

  gradually the howls of the bulldog
outside died down until at length they
gave way to low growls succeeded finally
by complete silence

  	apparently the brute had also given
up hope-hope of gaining access to the
interior of the hut and hurling himself
upon his enemies

  but after a lapse of about ten min-
utes the dog began to bark frantically
again as though something was arousing
him to a fresh display of fury

wonder whats the matter with him
now whispered simon  can it be
possible that he bears anybody outside
 perhaps he does rejoined leffing-
well hopefully  lets shout again and

for heavens sake yell as loud as you
can

  they called  help help  at the
top of their voices and this time to
their great joy they heard an answering
shout outside the hut

   this way men cried a deep bass
voice  theyre in this shack look
out for that dog he seems to be vi-
cious

  as though in acknowledgment of this
compliment the bulldogs snarls sud-
denly became so ferocious that simple
simons blood came pretty near curdling

   get out of the way there you ugly
beast cried another voice  ha
would you not much if youre look-
ing for trouble you shall have it

  there was a particularly ferocious
snarl a sharp report a dismal howl and
then an eloquent silence

   that settles him said the mans
voice  sorry i had to kill him but i
couldnt help myself you fellows saw
how he sprang at me owners of such
vicious dogs should keep them chained
up or expect to have them shot

   hooray  cried simon exultantly to
leffingwell  theyve shot that darned
dog whoever that feller is im his
friend for life for doing it

   who are you in there and whats
the matter with you  shouted one of
the men outside  open the door and
let us in

   we cant cried leffingwell  our
hands and feet are bound and we cant
move break in the door and release
us for heavens sake

   better be careful there fellows
somebody outside cautioned  this may
be a stall of some kind look out for
treachery

   pooh if they try anything of that
sort well fill every darn one of em full
of lead replied the deep bass voice
fiercely  shove in the door men and
lets sea whats going on

  a second later the door came in with
a crash and four uniformed men rushed
into the hut each of them carrying a
revolver in his hand

   were police officers announced the
man with the deep bass voice  whats
the matter here

   cant you see whats the matter
cried leffingwell fretfully  were tied
wanted by uncle sam



up here like a couple of trussed turkeys
for heavens sake man get a knife and
cut us loose without any more delay
ha whos responsible for this
demanded the deep-voiced man who
seemed to be in command of the squad

   a man named mitchell and a one-
eyed chinaman replied leffingwell
 hurry up and release us from these
confounded ropes and well explain
everything to youv

  the policemen produced jack-knives
and began to saw on the ropes in a few
minutes leffingwell and simple simon
were free and began to thank their de-
liverers profusely

  but the deep-voiced policeman cut
short their expressions of gratitude

   never mind thanking us he said
gruffly  well dispense with all that
tell us instead who you are and how
and why this happened you fellows
dont live in this place do you

   no we came over here in a row-
boat to catch mitchell who is a deserter
from the united states army and was
living here with the chinaman

   and mitchell and the chinaman
caught you instead eh  said the police-
man with a grin

  leffingwell nodded grimly

   yes i wish to goodness you fel-
lows bad arrived here sooner if youd
come an hour ago we might have caught
the cad after all

   well youre mighty lucky that were
here at all retorted the policeman  in
all probability youd have been tied up
here for several days to come if it hadnt
been for the watchman of that boat-club
across the river

   is that watchman responsible for our
being rescued cried leffingwell in sur-
prise

   yes you see we belong to the
river-squad and as our launch passed the
boat-house a while ago he hailed us and
told us of two suspicious men who had
borrowed one of his boats i guess-you
were the fellows eh

  leffingwell nodded

   well our suspicions were aroused
and we decided to investigate when
we came across your moored rowboat we
suspected something was wrong and
landed to look for you and find out what
you were after

    im mighty glad you did so de-
 clared leffingwell   suppose theres
 no chance of overtaking that deserter
 now eh he added wistfully

    im afraid not not unless you
 know in what direction he went he
 may have crossed the river in a rowboat
 or launch or he may have gone inland
 in either event hes had a pretty good
 start of us and i reckon hes miles away
 by this time

    confound him  growled leffing-
 well  id give my right hand to see
 that cad behind bars

chapter xv

an important clue

   before leaving the hut the river-po-
 licemen made a thorough search of the
 premises but the only objects of interest
 they discovered were the carriage-lamp
 which mitchell had used for signaling
 and a complete opium layout which they
 found in the closet

   the latter they guessed was the
 property of the chinaman but there
 were two pipes in the set and leffing-
 well half suspected that mitchell had
 been using one of them

   he mentioned his suspicion to the
 leader of the police-squad whose name
 by the way was sergeant nolan

    the latter took the queer-looking long
 bamboo tubes in his hand and examined
 them carefully

    i shouldnt be surprised if youre
 right he commented  this pipe here
 has been used by a fellow new at the
 game i can tell that by the amateurish
 way hes handled his dope i was de-
 tailed down in chinatown for four years
 before i was sent to the river-squad and
 there aint much about dope smoking 
 dont know

    of one thing im certain though
 he added  and that is that that de-
 serter chap has not been hitting the pipe
 to-day if he had been smoking the stuff
 -within the past twenty-four hours he
 wouldnt have possessed sufficient energy
 to be able to turn the tables on you when
 you broke in on him

    opium smoking makes a fellow
 drowsy and listless for hours afterward
 especially a beginner if that fellow had


the argosy

been up against the dope to-day youd
have been able to take him gun and all
without a struggle on his part

  gee whiz exclaimed leffingwell
disgustedly  what wretched luck i
have 

   oh well youll probably get an-
other chance at him remarked the ser-
geant comfortingly  if your friend
the deserter has hit the pipe once hell
probably do it again once a man be-
gins to smoke that stuff he cant keep
away from it and the chances are that
before very long this fellow will go to
some dope-joint to roll pills and smoke
himself into insensibility

   i wonder what that girl will say
when she learns that her lover has be-
come a dope-fiend mused leffingwell
 i must inform mr addison of the fact
its another strong point against mitch-
ell of course i suppose however that
foolish young woman wont believe it
shes so infatuated with that scoundrel
that even if she saw him with the pipe
to his lips i guess shed refuse to believe
the evidence of her own eyes

  if i were you went on the ser-
geant  id spend a few nights in chi-
natown i think you stand a good chance
of running across either your deserter or
the one-eyed chinaman or both of them
down there sooner or later

   then you dont think hes gone far
away from new york eh inquired
leffingwell eagerly

   well that depends- upon how much
of a scare your unexpected visit gave
him of course there are chinese quar-
ters in other cities and he and his chink
friend may have fled to one of these i
think however that theres about an
even chance that they wont bother to
leave new york but inside of a few
hours will steer for the nearest place
where they can get opium which of
course is chinatown

   do ye think theres a chance of their
coming back here broke in simple
simon

  the sergeant shook his head

   i hardly think theyll dare to re-
turn he replied  although of course
theres a slight possibility of it theres
 telling what crazy chances men will
take when the dope habit has unbalanced
their brains its likely though that

they wouldnt have gone away and left
you here bound and helpless unless theyd
fully made up their minds to desert this
place for good 

   but aint it strange that they should
have left that there confounded bulldog
and this here opium layout behind them
unless they intended to come back 
argued simple simon

   well that does seem somewhat odd
but of course they way have decided to
get rid of the dog replied the sergeant
 as for this layout they may have for-
gotten about it in the excitement of the
moment or they may have reckoned that
it wasnt worth the bother of carrying
away

   this is a pretty cheap outfit and
they can easily get another one like it
for a few dollars it wouldnt be worth
their while to run the risk of being
nabbed by coming back for it

   then you wouldnt advise us to wait
here for the rest of the night on the
chance of their returning inquired lefj
fingwell

  no i think youd have your wait
for nothing even if they come back at
all they aint likely to do so to-night if
they havent beaten it to some other city
theyre far more likely to go down to
chinatown to-night than to return to
this shack no doubt that one-eyed chi-
naman is well acquainted in the chink
section and hell take that deserter to
some joint down there where they can
pass the night in safety

   very good said leffingwell grimly
 then well go to chinatown right
away if that cad is there im going to
get him to-night if i have to visit every
den in the section

   i suppose you know the district
pretty well eh the sergeant inquired

   no im sorry to say i dont ive
-only been there three or four times in
my life replied leffingwell

   and i havent been there even that
much added simple simon

  the sergeant gave a roar of laughter

  do you hear that men he asked
turning to his subordinates  heres a
young man whos only seen chinatown
three or four times in his life and yet
he talks about going down there and get-
ting his man just as if it was as easy as
picking plums out of a pie
wanted by uncle sam	

  the other policemenechoed his laugh
 he stands a swell diance drawled
one

   i should say so declared the ser-
geant  youd better get somebody to
show you around my boy turning to
leffingwell  otherwise you stand a
mighty poor chance of finding your
man those chinks can hide a chap so
completely that even a bloodhound
would have difficulty in tracking him
down

   ill tell you what ill do he added
impulsively  i cfont know why youre
so particularly keen on catching this de-
serter chap he had not seen the ad-
vertisement in the newspaper offering
the five thousand dollars reward   but
 kind of like the looks of the pair of
you and i feetdisposed to help you

   the day after to-morrow ill have a
night off and if you like ill make an
appointment to meet you and take you
through chineeville

   id be glad to accept your kind
offer replied leffingwell  but really
i cant afford to wait until the day after
to-morrow that fellow may be down
there to-night and if so i must get
him before he has a chance to get
away

   well i guess youll find you wont
be able to accomplish anything alone
but of course youre welcome to try it
and i wish you luck were going back
to the launch now want us to give you
a lift to the other side of the river

   thanks wed like to avail our-
selves of your invitation but we prom-
ised to return that rowboat to the
watchman of the boat-club and-

   oh thats all right the sergeant
interrupted him  well attend to that
well take the boat in tow of our launch
and see that its returned all right
come along men its high time we
were moving

  leffingwell and simple simon stepped
into the police launch and were taken
across to the new york shore nor
was this the only courtesy which the
river-policemen accorded them

  upon learning that simple simon had
been bitten by the chinamans bulldog
one of the men who possessed some sur-
gical skill washed and dressed the
wound aboard the launch applying a

bandage as skilfully as any surgeon
could have done but at the same time
he advised simple simon to go to a hos-
pital as soon as possible and have the
wound examined in order to make sure
that there was no danger of hydrophobia

   well after all our luck isnt so
bad is it old man   observed leffing-
well cheerfully as they stood on the
bank watching the police launch disap-
pear up the river

  bad i should say not cried
simon  seems to me weve got more
good luck than sense whod have
thought wed have got out of our
troubles so easy an hour ago i
thought for sure we were doomed to die
of starvation in that confounded hut
were mighty fortunate to have escaped
so easy

   pooh  wasnt alluding to that
replied leffingwell  what i meant
was that were lucky that that opium
layout was found in the hut if it hadnt
been for that discovery wed have had
no reason to suspect that mitchell and
that one-eyed chinaman were dope-
smokers and that in all possibility
theyve fled to chinatown to spend the
night in some dope den

   it looks as if dame fortune with
unusual generosity is going to give us
another chance to catch that cad for
somehow i feel positive well find him
in chinatown to-night and if we do
hes not going to get away this time
i promise you

chapter xv i

in chinatown

   messmate said simple simon to
leffingwell as the pair climbed the
steep embankment of riverside drive
 do you think were doing the wise
thing in going down to chinatown to-
night dont you think wed do better
to wait until to-morrow  

   wait i should say not replied
leffingwell emphatically  to-morrow
night may be too late theres nothing
like striking while the iron is hot

   but think of the danger  pro-
tested simon earnestly  that deserter
chap and his one-eyed chinee friend arc
armed and we aint if we should run


the argosy

across them down there they probably has promised to come to his rescue and
wouldnt hesitate to put daylight through is going to putis case in the hands of

us this time

   pshaw im not afraid of that
exclaimed leffingwell  itll take more
than a gun to scare me next time i get
within hailing distance of that cad i
didnt think ypu were such a coward
simple

   i dont think im a coward i
guess ive got as much courage as the
average man but i cant see the sense

a good lawyer and pay all expenses

   you see therefore that even if
anything does happen to us a will be
looked out for if you wish however
you can stay here and try to get an in-
terview with that girl in the morning
and ill go down there alone

   i guess not replied simple simon
indignantly if you go im going
too of course after all theres some

of throwing our lives away and in my	consolation in knowing that even though

opinion any unarmed man vho deliber-	those fellers have got guns they aint

ately goes up against an enemy who has	got that there confounded bulldog with

a loaded gun is doing just that	them this time besides we may not

 pooh you werent always so pru-	succeed in finding them he added hope-

dent simon i havent forgotten the	fully

circumstances under which we first met	 oh well find them all right de-

you you broke up that meeting of	clared leffingwell confidently  i feel

rabid anarchists and were willing to	it in my bones that were going to gtet

fight the whole savage crowd by your-	that cad this time well if you insist
self and to think that it is such a man-on coming along old man lets be start-

who now has the nerve to preach pru-	ing we havent any time to lose

dence and caution to me	half an hour later they found them-

   that was different replied simon
earnestly  i only had myself to think
of then and in my rage i didnt care
what happened to me but now weve got
to think of our messmate in prison re-
member- he relies on us to help him out
of his trouble

   by a rare stroke of luck ive man-
aged to find out where that there young
woman lives to-morrow we must get
an interview with her and do our best
to persuade her to go to court and testify
in his favor thats more important
than capturing that deserter to my mind
if we come across those fellers and get
shot dead by them whats going to be-
come of our messmate whos going to
lookout for him

   well we must take care to see that
we dont get shot dead replied lef-
fingwell calmly if we find mitchell
and his one-eyed companion in a dope-
joint the chances are as that police
sergeant said theyll be so much under
the influence of the drug when we break
in on them that they wont be able to
move a hand and wellhave no difficulty
in taking their weapons away from them

   besides ive got some good news
for you about al i have not told you
yet that r a who is a very rich man

selves in that queer section of new york
which the resident chinese have trans-
formed into a town of their own

  they walked through the narrow
crooked streets staring at the odd-look-
ing buildings and boldly entering every
dive chop-suey joint and  gin-mill 
to which they were able to obtain ad-
mission  but not a clue could they dis-
cover as to the whereabouts of the man
for whom they were searching

  at one time their hopes mounted
high for their nostrils suddenly caught
the pungent odor of opium in process of
burning and eagerly they rushed up a
rickety uncarpeted stairway confident
that at length they had found the de-
serter

   careful  whispered simple si-
mon to leffingwell as the latter placed
his hand upon the latch of a door from
beyond which tlie opium fumes were
issuing  remember that theyre armed
and they may not be thoroughly under
the influence of the dope yet hadnt
we better wait until theyve smoked a
little more we-

  but paying no heed to this prudent
warning the eager leffingwell turned
the handle of the door and rushed into
the room

a tale of the bottle

by george m a cain

                  the sudden recollection that sent a bookkeeper back
                  across the ferry toward home in double-quick tirfte

miths hand trembled a little as
he took up his pen to go to work
on the long columns of figures there
were deep rings under his eyes his
cheeks had grown flabby these last weeks
as though the flesh had drawn away
from a skin that used to fit

  a grayish pallor had taken the place
of the fine color which office confinement
had never been able to destroy

  aha you say same old thing
one of those long hard sprees that send
a man to the alcoholic ward

   aha  i reply  youd better put
your money on a horse that is named on
the card you need several more
guesses mr smith never got off the
front seat of the water-wagon in his life
why he fought like a mad bull when
they made him take whisky to bring him
out of a chill two years before this
story begins

  no the truth of the matter is that
smith had a baby just six weeks old

if you had possessed a bare speaking
acquaintance with smith you would
have known that every one at the
office knew

  every one knew just how much it
weighed the day it was born  just how
much more the next day just how much
less the third day just how much-and
so on for six times seven days

  every one knew that smith was afraid
to trust the nurse or even his wife to
prepare the milk for that precious childs
bottles every one knew how much he
had to pay for certified milk how many
ounces from the top of the bottle he
took how much water and milk-sugar
and lime-water and barley and all the
rest of it went into each days supply of
infant food

  every one knew just how many hours
smith had walked the floor with his
first-born the previous night

  but what you would not have known



 that particular morning - what no-
body knew - was that smith had poi-
soned his babys food smith did not
know it himself when he came in

  on the train his mind had been occu-
pied as usual of late with thoughts of
the preparation of  modified milk 
formulae and there had come a vague
feeling that in putting up the days
foftd this morning he had done some-
thing unusual wherefore while his eye
sought an elusive twenty-cent error in
yesterdays accounts his thought searched
his memory to discover just what he had
mixed into his babyjmnilk

  his finger reached the middle of the
dime column for the sixteenth time just
as his mind recalled exactly what he had
done amiss the pallor deepened on his
face his finger shook away over into
the thousand-dollar row then it helped
the rest of his hand fish his watch from
his pocket

  eight forty - five - heavens the
babys first feeding from this mornings
preparation would be due at nine yes
-and he had put an extra powder into
that mixture-about one or two tea-
spoonfuls

  and the only extra powder around the
babys things was boracic acid he was
sure of it he had kept all those things
separate he knew just what was there

  he rushed to the telephone and called
up a number in harlem

   louise-louise he cried as soon as
he heard the snap caused by the removal
of the receiver at the other end

   my name is not louise came back
frigidly and there was another snap as
the receiver went back on its hook

  then he remembered that he had
moved to hackensack a month before
the baby was born

  there was no telephone in the hack-
ensack house but the drug-store on the
nearest corner would take a message


the argosy

   give me  a hackensack he
shouted into the mouthpiece

  while be waited for a reply he
watched the big hand of his timepiece
reach for and cover the figure  xi

  i find  as busy came back at
last  ill call you

  at ten-second intervals smith repeat-
ed his call-ineffectually it was one
minute to nine when central said sweet-
ly   theres your party go ahead

  there was a great roar in smiths ear
some one was yelling  hallo  at the
top of his voice smith yelled back
the halloing continued until the precious
minute was up the party at the other
end then moderated his voice enough-to
make smith understand

   youll have to wait till mr pilham
comes back im his father - but im
deaf theres just been another party
trying-

  smith dropped the receiver on to the
hook it was too late

  his boy-the heir to his life-insurance
-the future bishop governor presi-
dent financial magnate-was-a goner

  no there was still a little hope
boracic acid was not labeled  poison
probably it was not so terribly virulent
perhaps if he could get word home in
half or thfee-quarters of an hour a doc-
tor could be got who would be able to
do something

  a telegram no he could reach
home before a telegram could arrive

  all he said to the boss was  i must
go-my babys dying he waited not
to hear words of sympathy

  he ran to the ferry-house and just
caught the  boat as he took his
seat he got out his time-table and found
that the next train left at 

  the majority of the morning trains
run into and not out of the city he
must send the telegram and take  a
chance on its reaching home in time

  he was the first man off the boat at
the jersey city slip he gave one of
the deck-hands a half dollar to let him
through the gate and made a flying leap
when the boat was full two yards from
the float

  by the time the other passengers were
starting up the walk he was trying to
control the shake in his fingers and form
the words of the message home

   baby is poisoned he wrote  get
the doctor immediately

  how quick can you rush that
through   he asked of the operator

   in two minutes was the reply
smith pulled out his watch when it
occurred to him that he would probably
scare his wife to death with such a mes-
sage

  have you got that off yet  he cried
to the man whose finger was working
rapidly on the telegraph-key there was
a moments pause before the telegrapher
replied just finished it sir i was
lucky to get a clear wire in a hurry
gracious shouted the husband
and father  youve probably killed
my wife with fright why couldnt you
wait a minute

   why exclaimed the operator in
astonished wrath  you blanked idiot
you told me to send it in a hurry what
do you mean 

  but smith did not hear him he was
busy writing another message

   i put boracic acid in food doctor
can save him he scrawled

  he handed the operator a dollar bill
with the yellow slip whereupon that in-
dignant gentleman swallowed his anger
and rushed through the second message
smith wondered whether this one would
follow the first immediately or have to
wait for a messenger-boy to stroll back
from his house to get it

  up and down the vast waiting-room
he paced wildly once he counted his
ready cash with a view to hiring a
special train he concluded that ten
dollars would hardly induce the com-
pany to accommodate hpi thus

  so he watched the sign-boards over
the gates each one he committed to
memory then reread forty times before
it was removed

 his mind was in an agony one
minute he would imagine he saw his babe
in the throes of convulsions next min-
ute he decided that the acid would prob-
ably send the child out of this world in
silent deadly sleep

  as he walked to and fro he overheard
two guards holding a whispered con-
sultation as to whether he was an es-
caped inmate from some asylum whom
they ought to turn over to the station
police	t
  just about tbat time another guard
leisurely shoved signs into a big bul-
letin-frame and over one of the gates
indicating that the n y s and w
train for a dozen other stations and
hackensack was in condition to receive
prospective passengers

  once more he was the first man
through the gate but he had to wait
for tbe train to start exactly like every
one else in his case that meant a wait
of fifteen minutes

  there was a delay of two minutes
more in getting out of the station-yards
there were five stops before hacken-
sack and smith thought he had never
seen so many people getting  and off
so much baggage to be handled at each
stop

  but there was no wreck neither of
the bridges was washed away or opened
to let a stray catboat pass there were
two tracks and the train did not have
to switch for others it eventually
reached hackensack at four minutes
past eleven

  smith sprinted up main street at a
pace that almost aroused that busy
thoroughfare from its repose as he
turned the corner into pleasantdale
avenue he caught sight of the ambling
figure of a messenger-boy ahead

  from the opposite corner fi small auto-
mobile sped toward him regardless of
the regulations of the town council
the automobile tbe boy and smith ar-
rived at the front steps of his home
simultaneously also simultaneously
mrs smith opened the door and looked
wildly at the three

  everybody spoke at once

   oh what have you done oh doc-
tor save my child  wailed mrs smith

  what you been doing to your baby
asked the doctor in his easy-going un-
alarmed professionally offhand manner

   message for mrs smith announced
the boy as though he were by far the
most important individual around

   thank god hes still alive  shout-
ed mr smith

  for above the questions and an-
nouncements powerful enough to have
drowned out all these sounds the in-
articulate shrieks of baby smith could
be heard if mr smith had not been
puffing so loudly he would probably

have heard his son and heir by the time
he was half-way home from the station

all went inside still talking-all but
the messenger-boy he was left behind

  finding himself thus neglected he
took possession of one of the chairs on
the veranda and to keep from growing
impatient with the delay took out the
yellow volume from his pocket and be-
gan to read where the hero with a
mighty leap bearing the heroine in his
arms cleared the bottomless chasm and
hid himself and his sweetheart in the
long swamp-grass on the other side just
in time to escape the villainous pur-
suers

  mrs smith began to talk again-or
rather continued to talk

  oh dear what shall we do what
shall we do everything is all ready
doctor there is a boiler full of hot
water for a bath the mustard is there
-i put a mustard-plaster on his stom-
ach there are three rolls of bandages
and two fresh rolls of absorbent cotton
and-

  the doctor repeated his question
  what was it you gave him

  smith answered in a sepulchral tone
of deep despair  it was boracic acid
do you think you can save him

  the doctor paused with an expression
of disappointment on his face

 boracic acid umm-mm-mm how
much of it did you give him 

   i think it was a teaspoonful
mourned smith is there any hope
 no-o i hardly think-

   oh dont say that - dont tell me
my baby- wept mrs smith

  no-o i was just going to say i
dont know as that would hurt him par-
ticularly might cause a slight disturb-
ance what else-how much other stuff
was there to dilute the boracic

   nine ounces of ten-per-cent milk
one and one-half ounces each of milk-
sugar and lime-water twenty ounces of
boiled water smith rattled off the
well-known formula automatically

  the latter portion of the receipt had
to be delivered in a roar they had
entered the room where the small pa-
tient was making known his distaste with
things as they are

  whether he was dangerously poisoned
or not he was highly uncomfortable


the argosy

his clothes had been removed and re-
placed with an assortment of pink and
blue blankets from which a very red
head and a very loud noise proceeded

   um-mm-mmph  grunted the phy-
sician again rather louder than the
former grunt  how many feedings of
this mixture with boracic acid have you
given 

  smith looked at his wife she lodked
at him

   i put the acid in this mornings
preparation smith explained

   why exclaimed his wife  i
havent given him any of that yet he
didnt wake up till half past ten and
just as i got the bottle warmed to give
him your telegram came

  mrs smiths voice rose with the color
in her fair cheeks

   and you tom smith made me all
this trouble-made me take all the skin
off his poor little stomach for nothing
you wretch-you- 

   a little sweet oil and cotton will
fix that all right mrs smith broke in
the doctor  i guess all i can do is to
tell you to mix him some food and give
it to him by the way did you try that
sugar of magnesia i told you to get yes-
terday

  he had to wait for a reply smiths
jaw had dropped to an angle where
speech was impossible at last he came
to sufficiently to stammer in a hoarse
whisper

   sugar of magnesia-sugar of mag-
nesia-why-why-why that was the

extra powder i put in this morning 
knew i had added something i-i
thought-i forgot the magnesia and
thought it must be boracic acid

  five minutes later baby smith his
rather raw stomach wrapped in oil and
cotton clothed and in his right mind
so far as he had any was peacefully
pulling at the rubber nipple of a warm
white bottle mrs smith was gradually
coming around under treatment with an-
other bottle-of porter

  mr smith had started to see the doc-
tor to his automobile and found the boy
disgruntled over the interruption just
where the indian ambush began to fire
upon the fugitive hero and heroine the
doctors chauffeur got the machine
cranked up as smith finished signing for
the second of his telegrams

   say mr smith the physician
paused to utter and his tone was very
grave and earnest  what became of
that nurse i recommended to you

   why explained smith  there was
so little for her to do-i suppose my
wife gave her a day off

   well look here when she gets
back you give her my prescriptions for
that babys food and you let her make
them and take care of him-wash him
dress him feed him - and all the rest
do that or get another doctor to look
out for your family do you under-
stand

  smith said he understood then the
doctor told his chauffeur to proceed on
his way home

caxtons breezy personality and

favor of his keepers and he was granted
a good many privileges about the prison

incarceration in walking up and down it
for exercise or halting before one of the

cells to engage its inmate in welcome
conversation

  this last afternoon of his stay how-
ever he had little to say to any of his
fellow prisoners being entirely engaged
in a consideration of the problem which
he had set for himself with muriel

  up and down the restricted space he
paced accordingly his eyes bent upon
the floor his hands clasped meditatively
behind his  back but the harder he
thought and the more he cudgeled his
brains the farther away seemedany plan
which appealed to him as at all feasible

   at last out of his very desperation a
whimsical idea suggested itself why
not take counsel of one of these crimi-
nals by whom he was surrounded their
lives were spent in the continual effort
to evade detection and pursuit who
then more likely to comprehend the
wiles and feints to which von altdorlf
would resort and how best to circumvent
them 

   was it not an old axiom  set a rogue
to catch a rogue 

  the more he dwelt upon the notion
the more sensible did it appear so he
finally decided to try it and after men-
tally running over in his mind the vari-
ous prisoners to determine which one
most closely resembled von altdorff in
type he selected as his mentor a hard-
ened ruffian known to local fame as
der schnable from the size of his nose

  der schnable was a churlish scowling
blackguard who according to the police
stood ready to commit any crime for the
sake of a few florins and who in fact
had been charged at various times with
about every offense in the calendar but
so wily had he proven himself in his evil-
doing and so well did he recognize the
advisability of keeping a still tongue in
his head that often as he had been ar-
rested he had never yet suffered a con-
viction

  he was in jail now upon suspicion of
complicity in a particularly flagrant high-
way robbery which had taken place on
one of the main avenues a few evenings
before but secure in the knowledge that
the authorities had no real proof against
him he had resisted all attempts to ex-
tort a confession from him in the aus-
trian equivalent for the  third degree
and now still wrapped in his mantle of
 a

disdainful silence was serenely awaiting
his inevitable release

  constantly on guard he was never
known to speak to the keepers or indeed
to any of his fellow prisoners save in an
occasional growling monosyllable but
no one could resist caxtons blithe face
and engaging greeting and to the sur-
prise of the entire prison der schnable
had the day before returned a gruff
 good morning  to the americans salu-
tation

  with this as an entering wedge and
the exchange of cigarette papers and
tobacco to facilitate friendly feelings
caxton bravely assaulted the fellows im-
penetrable reserve and before they part-
ed actually led him into quite a little
chat-mainly one-sided it is true but
nevertheless responded to with a certain
hesitating amiability

  only indifferent subjects had been
touched upon then of course and
whether the man would discuss questions
of a professional character was very
problematic still caxton told himself
that he could but try and he was certain
that if dcr schnable would consent to
open up a very mine of criminal strategy
would be exposed to him

  he had too one very strong point of
vantage for he had learned in the pre-
vious interview that the rascal was very
curious about america having a more or
less well-defined idea of emigrating
thither in order as he said to escape the
persecution of the police

  therefore in accosting him again
caxton led the talk diplomatically to his
native land and dilated enthusiastically
upon the success which might await an
ambitious foreigner there especially if
backed up by so rich and influential a
personage as himself

   ill have a line of immigration offi-
cers stretched out clear across new york
bay to intercept him if he ever ventures
to start he muttered under his breath
 but heaven forgive me ive got to
pretend now that we would regard him
as an original prize package

   why by jove he exclaimed aloud
 i wouldnt be surprised old man to
see you on the new york police force
within a month or two after you land
wouldnt that be a jolt to these folks
over here that have been running you


the argosy

down and continually giving you the
worst of it 

   ah  der schnable showed his
blackened fangs in a gratified smile

 that would please me well mein herr
a policeman eh a detective ah
yes i should make a fine success at that

   do you believe so well now come
to think it over ill bet you would
and by the way carelessly  i wonder
if you couldnt help me out on a little
problem in that line ive been puzzling
over quite a good deal

   about a month ago you must un-
derstand a friend of mine mysteriously
disappeared the general public believe
that he left of his own free will-eloped
in fact but i know that he was assaulted
by two men and carried away a prisoner
to another part of the city

  there was a quick involuntary twitch
of the listeners shoulder and his glance
recoiled for just the fraction of a second

    i am afraid i could make nothing- of
such a case he muttered  it is too
long ago and-

    oh  it is not rejoined caxton
in a low voice bending sharply toward
him  and you can tell me everything
about the case for you were one of the
two men who struck down laszlo cheg-
nay in the alley of the burg theater 

   it did not require a brick house to fall
upon the keen-witted young new yorker
in the way of driving home a point to
his brain a moment before he had not
held the slightest suspicion that the man
in front of him had been concerned in
the outrage now he knew it for a truth

  that slight involuntary twitching of
the neck-muscles had told him the truth

  dcr schnable however after that one
telltale start had immediately resumed
his usual shell of surly taciturnity

   i know nodings go away  was
the only answer he would return to all
of caxtons eager importunities

  it was evident that he now regarded
the latter merely as an agent of the po-
lice and the friendly overtures which
had been made toward him as merely a
new form of lure wherewith to entrap
his wary feet

  nor could all the others persuasions
and arguments serve to swerve him from
this conviction to bribes threats en-
treaties and promises alike he listened in

scornful unconcern and still maintained
his obstinate silence

   a thousand florins if you will tell
me where you took him offered caxton

  no answer

   two thousand

   still no answer

   better tell for i swear that if i
find any harm has come to him i will
spend fifty times that amount to send
you to the gallows  

   continued silence

  two thousand florins if you will
only  tell me the name of the man who
hired you

  der schnable leisurely stretched him-
self out on his bunk and closing his eyes
pretended to sleep

  was it captain von altdorff

  a contemptuous snore was the only
audible response

  and this was the net result to all of
caxtons further inquiries in the end
he had to desist and return to his cell
with the cenviction pretty strongly im-
pressed upon his mind that der schnable
was the finest performer in a purely
 thinking part  that he had ever seen

  yet it was maddening to know that
this fellow could tell all if only some
way was discovered to win his confi-
dence there must be some method of
unloosing his tongue

  yes he must be made to divulge his
knowledge but how how how

  all that evening and far into the
night caxton pondered over the prob-
lem debating every possible means of
persuasion from the rack and thumb-
screws to the offering of enormous
bribes but finally upon his perturbed
pillow there fell a suggestion which
seemed to him little short of an inspira-
tion  and wtith a sigh of weary relief
he turned over and went to sleep

  bright and early next morning a
summons came for him to report at the
captains office -and when he reached
there he found to his satisfaction that
his long-awaited release had arrived at
last

   may i ask one question upon leav-
ing herr captain he queried deferen-
tially

   certainly mein herr speak on

   how long will you tell me if it
does not conflict with your official regu-
not for sale



lations do you expect to hold the pris-
oner known as der schnable

  the captain frowned

  just as long as we can under the
charge of suspicion he retorted crossly
 we have no evidence against him and
will have to discharge him eventually
but while we have him with us we are
sure that he is out of mischief

   but interposed caxton  suppose
that evidence could be obtained against
him of complicity in a very serious of-
fense suppose let us say that he had
committed a burglary and was now
alarmed over some hints i had let drop
showing that i had a suspicion of his
guilt if he were to be released this
morning would it not be his first im-
pulse to go to those with whom he had
stored his booty and make sure that it
is still safe 

   ah i see slowly  then you
want-

   i want this man released this morn-
ing and the moment that he leaves
yonder door a couple of your most ex-
pert spies placed upon his trail with
instructions not to lose sight of him for
a single minute

   and you will personally press the
charge it will be burglary i think
you said 

   it will be almost anything you
choose to make it enough at any rate
to  keep him out of mischief  for several
years and i will press it all right
have no fear of that oh yes i will
press it 

  the captain leaned back in his chair
a slow gleam of satisfaction dawning
in his eye at the thought of at last tri-
umphing over the crafty der schnable

   very well mein herr he said
crisply  it shall be s you say
accordingly half an hour or so
thereafter a strange procession wended
its way here and there throughout the
streets of vienna

  to the fore slinking along as though
anxious to avoid attention yet evidently
free from any suspicion that he was
followed proceeded der schnable
half a block behind came one of the
police spies artistically disguised as a
junkman while still farther back loi-
tered the other in the role of a flower-
vender

  and at the same distance to the rear
as this latter man but holding to paral-
lel streets marched tom caxton his
movements being directed at each corner
by the pseudo flower merchant according
to a prearranged code of signals

  up and down through many streets
they passed and into many different
quarters of the town for der schlia-
ble led them a long and devious chase
but at last as though satisfied that no
possible danger threatened him and that
he might proceed direct to his destina-
tion he settled into a brisker less errant
gait

  into the pestalozzi strasse he turned
and continued along it for several blocks
to cut at last into a short side street
with but one exit

  caxton arriving at tbe corner below
saw the flower merchant beckoning ex-
citedly to him and came forward upon
a run

  together they sped along the square
then halted sharply at a gesture from
the junkman ahead and peeped cautious-
ly around the corner into schwartzen-

berg platz

  der schnable was just then ascending
the steps at the residence of general
chegnay

      chapter xix 

with chisel and mallet

   well ill be jiggered gasped
caxton still hardly able to grasp the
solution of the mystery yet feeling too
that he should have grasped it long ago

  plain it was as plain as a pike-
staff to him now that the key to the
riddle was thrust squarely under his
nose

  the general spartan old father that
be was rather than have his son marry
contrary to his wishes had simply hired
two bravos sent them to a spot where
he knew his son was sure to come caused
him to be kidnaped and was now keep-
ing him locked up until he should agree
to comply with the paternal wishes

  this was the meaning of the old
counts agitation on the day of caxtons
visit to him and also of his evasion and
hesitation until the american had prac-
tically forced him into a lie


the argosy

  this too was the meaning of that
interrupted and misunderstood signal
which the old servant had tried to give
him at the door the faithful fellow
devoted to laszlo no doubt had at-
tempted to give him some intimation of
the truth and he had been too much
of a numskull to take it in

  yes that was what he had been from
first to last a numskull but he would
be one no longer he would have las-
zlo out of that house and back into the
arms of his muriel before one could say
jack robinson

  by this time dcr schnablc had fin-
ished a short colloquy with old franz
upon the doorstep and had lurched off
up the street so caxton dismissing his
police allies sauntered blithely up to
the house with the same question which
had been upon his lips when he was
there before

  the gray-haired servitor gave a quick
start of recognition upon seeing him
again but almost immediately let fall
over his features the deferentially ex-
pressionless mask which is the mark of
the butler the world over

   the count laszlo chegnay is not
at home sir he replied without a quiver
in his face  he has not been here for
some time and  do not know when he
will return

  caxton thrust forward a quick foot
and held open the door which the other
had started to close

   you mean and he mockingly mim-
icked the mans precise tone  that the
count laszlo is home has been for some
time and you cant tell me when he will
depart well i can tell you he will
be leaving here in just about three min-
utes or else the whole kit and caboodle
of you will be bundled off to the station-
house now are you going to stand out
of the way and let me go to my friend 
at that moment however there came
a harsh imperative hail from over the
banisters

   franz it called  is that the im-
pudent yankee who called here the other
day and annoyed us so if it is tell
him if he does not immediately cease his
stupid threats and go away from my
house i shall open fire on him from
the upper windows with my pistols
there was a ring of resolution in the

speakers voice which indicated that he
would do exactly as he said and caxton
having no desire to be pot-shotted in
any such fashion not unnaturally hesi-
tated

  while he was debating whether to
stand his ground or retreat however he
suddenly noticed that old franz was
distorting his right eye in a peculiar
manner and at the same time nodding
violently with his head toward the ad-
jacent street corner

  taking these signs therefore as an
invitation to a rendezvous and reflecting
that discretion is ever the better part
of valor he parleyed no longer but
withdrawing from the inhospitable door-
step with as much dignity as he could
master took his stand around the corner
to await developments

  nor did he find that he had been mis-
taken in his reading of the signalsfor
presently almost before he had got well
settled dowrn to his vigil franz came
trotting along with a market-basket upon
his arm

   are you really a friend to my young
master sir he questioned peering into
caxtons face as though he would read
his very soul

   as good a one as he will ever have
my man  and prepared to be a friend
to you too if you will help me get him
out of that house come now tell me
just where he is confined and what is
the best way of getting to him 

   oh sir dont ask me that  and
the old servant began to tremble vio-
lently  i can answer no questions i
can tell you nothing the old master
compelled all of us to take a binding and
terrible oath that we would disclose none
of the affairs of the family to any out-
sider

   caxton began to lose patience

   all right then so much the worse
for him and you too the only thing
left for me is to call in the help of the
police

  old franz drew himself up with a
touch of arrogance

   you talk nonsense he said  the
police would not dare to invade the resi-
dence of general chegnay a civil writ
might possibly get you in some time
but that would doubtless take several
weeks
not for sale



  from his own recent experience the
american had no doubt that it would
and he saw too that the butler was
speaking from an intimate familiarity
with local customs when he so con-
temptuously denied any fear at the threat
of calling in the police

   what am i to do then  demanded
caxton almost desperately

  a shrewd gleam came into the others
eye

   i thought the american gentleman
might perhaps be looking for lodgings
he said significantly

   lodgings

   yes there are some excellent ones
immediately next door to us if i might
venture a suggestion i would recommend
the back room on the third floor

   ah i begin to see the windows
in that room are they adjacent to the
windows in your house or is there any
passage between them up over the
roofs	 

   alas mein herr our windows are
very tightly barred and shuttered and
there is no passage of any kind between
the two houses

   then why the dickens should i
want to take this room you speak of
you dont expect me to break down the
wall do you

   if the american gentleman should
care to amuse himself in that way re-
joined franz discreetly  i have an ex-
cellent cold chisel and mallet which i
would be pleased to lend him and i
shall also be most happy to assist him
in the work

   well ill be jiggered  again ejac-
ulated caxton and then he began to
laugh  that must certainly have been
a peach of an oath that the old gentleman
made you swear friend but it all goes
to show the truth of the old saying that
theres more than one way of killing a
cat on the whole i guess your scheme
is as good as any i can frame up so
if you will bring along the  excellent
cold chisel and mallet ill rent the
room and we can proceed to our di-
versions

  he spoke less lightly of the task
though before the day was done for it
proved to be long and tiresome job
that of making a breach in the solid
masonry of those old-fashioned walls

even with two of them to help and the
work was rendered more onerous by the
necessity for keeping down any undue
amount of noise

  indeed caxtons blistered palms
would more than once have tempted him
to stop had there not come an occasional
tap-tap from the other side of the parti-
tion to show him that his efforts were
being eagerly watched in that direction

  the afternoon waned the daylight
faded and night came on but still the
two strange companions worked steadily
energetically  away caxton asked many
questions but to them all the old man
returned the invariable shuddering re-
ply that he had  taken an oath   and
the americans curiosity remained un-
satisfied

  what would meet them on the other
side of that wall caxton kept wonder-
ing was it only chegnay that they had
set out to rescue or was the woman
known as jay van brunt there also

  then too was chegnay in good
health able to leave without assistance
when the time should come of had he
been injured at the time of his abduc-
tion and now in shape requiring a vehicle
or ambulance but to all these queries
old franz returned never a word

  at times too caxton questioned in
his own heart whether he might not
simply be walking into a trap cunningly
baited for him by the general and franz
and although he was not afraid of any
bodily injury he wavered a little at the
thought of what austrian law might do
to him for so bold an invasion into the
premises of one of the aristocrats

  but at last the partition was all down
to a mere intervening shell and with a
sudden impulse the american threw his
weight quickly against it and brought
the whole thing down with a crash which
echoed through both houses like a crack
of doom 

  for a moment his vision was obscured
by the clouds of dust and mortar and
then he recognized with a thrill of re-
lief that he had not wrought in vain
for through the aperture with out-
stretched hand stepped laszlo

   we must hurry though the aus-
trian exclaimed  my father is already
thundering at my door and he will brek
in by another minute ach himmel 


the argosy

interrupting himself sharply  and i
almost forgot something  

  as he spoke he dived hurriedly back
through the hole and when he reap-
peared again he was clasping a bulky
manuscript to his breast

   it is my opera he exclaimed simply
 i have had plenty of time to finish
it all alone here with my thoughts and
i ended it to-day it would have been
an irreparable loss if i had left that be-
hind  but i am ready now come let
us go 

  it was indeed time that they should
fly for to the generals crashing blows
against the door and vociferous threats
was now added a clamor for the police
from the other dwelling

  caxton threw open the door to his
room and disclosed his landlady and a
group of women in the hall outside all
shrieking at the top of their voices

  he made no attempt to explain mat-
ters to her but simply thrusting a roll
of bills into her hand seized chegnav
by the arm and hurried him down the
stairs

  out of the house they dashed then
through the crowd gathering outside
and just as a couple of gens darmes
started for them they leaped into a pass-
ing cab and were whirled away

  of course there was butone destina-
tion for either of them and equally of
course their tongues ran like mad in
questions and explanations all the way
to the hotel but a sudden silence fell
on both when they arrived at the mil-
lionaires apartments and found father
and daughter both away

   do you know where miss muriel
has gone questioned caxton of the
maid who had met them

   oh yes sir captain von altdorff
called for her in great excitement about
ten minutes ago and she left with him 

chapter xx

solferino breaks another record

  von altdorff 

  for a moment the two men stood ga-
zing at each other in consternation

  caxton had told laszlo in the cab
coming along of the painful scene be-
tween van brunt and the gray mus-

tached captain and of the almost insane
fury into which the latter had been
goaded by the knowledge that muriel
had been won by another so that now
there was but one thought in both their
minds

  the man crazed by his hopeless yearn-
ing was attempting to secure by craft
and force the prize which had been de-
nied to his suing

  he had lured the girl away upon
some pretext or another-madmen are
always most plausible in their explana-
tions-and now having her in his power
was planning to carry her off and force
her into marrying him

  in america such a supposition upon
the grounds they had would have seemed
exaggerated and absurd but here in the
passionate south where mens minds
were still attuned to the measure of feu-
dal times and where they themselves
had just been concerned in abductions
mysteries and rescues of quite the six-
teenth century pattern it seemed the most
natural conclusion in the world

  stricken speechless therefore at the
news and at the dire possibilities in-
volved they stood staring at each other
aghast for the space of half a dozen
breaths then seized by a common im-
pulse they turned together and hastened
wildly down the street

  up and down they gazed eagerly
but nowhere in sight could they descry
any sign of either the captain or his com-
panion then while they stood at a
loss uncertain what next to do a high-
pitched foppish voice broke on their
ears and horowitz who had been loun-
ging in front of the hotel advanced
airily with outstretched hand tovvard
laszlo

   why my dear chegnay he ex-
claimed loftily taking no notice what-
ever of caxton  when did you return
ah but you took us all by surprise you
clever dog and now you are a staid old
benedict of course back from the de-
lights of the honeymoon to get papas
blessing and all that sort of thing eh

  but laszlo hoarsely cut in upon his
bantering

   have you seen anything of von
altdorff he demanded gripping the
other by the shoulder with an intensity
which caused the little man to wince
not for sale



   von altdorff why certainly he
left here only a few moments ago with
the charming miss bonner they got
into a carriage which was waiting and
drove away like the very dickens i
was just wondering what it all meant
and why-

  drove off snapped caxton in
what direction

   horowitz  fixed his eye-glasses and re-
warded the interruption with a cold and
haughty stare

   i have not the honor of your ac-
quaintance yankee he started to say
insultingly but seeing a dangerous
gleam come into the americans eyes
he skipped nimbly to the other side of
chegnay and addressed his remark to
him

   as i was tellifig you my dear las-
zlo he observed hastily  von altdorff
and miss bonner drove away together in
a carriage and where do you think they
went to the arsenal of all places in
the world and at this time of night
too what do you suppose it can pos-
sibly mean

  to the arsenal incredulously

   yes sir i dont wonder that you
are surprised but it is nevertheless the
truth i distinctly heard him give the
order to the kutscher  to the arsenal
he said and-

  but already the other two had ceased
to pay any attention to him

   shall we take a carriage or motor-
car  the american was questioning
sharply  a motor  guess by all
means 

   no swiftly decided laszlo horses
we do not know where the trail may
lead and a motor might get stalled we
can get good mounts at the stable just
back of the hotel indeed my own horse
solferino is there

  the colloquy had taken scarcely half
a second and almost before the last word
was out the two had turned and were
making for the stable on a run leaving
poor horowitz his curiosity piqued and
unsatisfied to turn over a dozen new
queries in his buzzing brain and annoy
almost every one who came by with his
agitated demands for an explanation

  meanwhile the horses were being led
out and saddled although all too slowly
for chegnays impatience and indeed

the last girth was hardly buckled before
he had vaulted into his seat and given
an ardent  vorwaerts  to his willing
steed

   then rat-a-tat-tat rat-a-tat-tpt ame
the clang of iron-shod hoofs upon the
pavement and the two were off along
the wide avenues and under the glare of
the electric lamps in a surging gallop

  caxton was something of a horseman
himself having spent a good part of his
youth upon a western ranch but he
was free to confess that he had never
seen such an exhibition of riding as was
given by his companion that night

  chegnay and the splendid animal he
bestrode seemed to be one creature the
horse sensing as though by instinct the
wishes of his master in regard to speed
and direction and requiring hardly a
word or the slightest pressure upon the
bridle-rein

  eyes straight ahead his clear-cut
handsome profile gleaming like marble
in the white glow of the arc-lamps pos-
sessed of but one purpose to overtake
and win at any hazard the lover rode
like a veritable unleashed demon whirl-
ing heedlessly around corners dashing
in and out between trolley-cars cabs and
automobiles at unchecked speed risking
life and limb a dozen times at the chance
of a slip upon the asphalt or a stumble
across the car-tracks

  at almost every corner policemen held
up excited batons and a constant mutter
of curses from drivers and chauffeurs
followed in their wake but chegnay
never slackened pace nor drew rein at
any of the interruptions

  his one cry to solferino was vor-
wacrts-the one passion of his soul
vorwaerts ever and always vor-
ivaerts 

  and the gallant chestnut responded
well to his demand head grandly up
eye flashing all his muscles of whipcord
and steel in magnificent play solferino
swept onward like a meteor-twisting
turning evading obstacles sometimes by
scarcely more than a hairsbreadth yet
easily gracefully without a misstep and
never for one moment losing his splendid
stride

  caxton followed as best he could upon
his inferior mount a dozen times his
heart was in his throat when his com-




the argosy

panion would essay some especial hazard 
but he was ashamed not to venture where
the other so daringly led and by pure
miracle so it seemed to him he escaped
unscathed

  now however they had passed beyond
the fortifications the limits of the old
town and were on freer less encumbered
streets where the risks were less constant
and the going easier than on the slippery
asphalt

  caxton ranged up beside his comrade
and by the active use of spur and whip
managed to keep his sweating beast
upon more even terms with solferino
who for all his charging rush had not
yet turned a hair it was hard work
though at the best his mount could do
for ever at more and more frequent in-
tervals laszlo would give his sharp im-
patient cry of vorwaerts  and the chest-
nut would answer with a new and more
surprising burst of speed

  at last however the end-at least
the end of their first stage-was in sight
up a little ascent they tore and down in
the hollow beneath them they could see
the dark mass of buildings which form
the square of the arsenal

   usually at night the place was gloomy
and deserted but this evening to their
surprise it presented a scene of the great-
est activity the wide yard with its
row of sheds for the housing of von
altdorffs ballrooms was all alight with
the glow of arc-lamps and a crowd of
workmen could be seen in the center
about the huge gas-bag of the largest
one which fully inflated swayed un-
steadily and tugged hard at its moorings

  and then as caxton and chegnay
stared with uncomprehending eyes they
saw the crowd scatter back and in the
broad illumination beheld von altdorff
and muriel advance and take their places
in the basket

  a murmur of voices was borne to their
ears the bark of a sharp authoritative
order then the men scattered still far-
ther back and the restraining ropes were
let go

  up into the air shot the big cigar-
shaped bag with its dangling cordage
and human freight the staccato cough
of its motor hummed out upon the air
the propeller began slowly to revolve
they were off

   a passionate cry of remonstrance burst
from laszlos lips as though it had been
torn from his very heart the hand
which held the whip he never used upon
solferino rose in a quick gesture and
came down in a sharp stinging cut across
the mettlesome creatures flank

  resenting the unaccustomed punish-
ment the horse sprang forward like an
arrow shot from a bow

  down the little declivity he fairly
bolted his head swinging wide at every
leap-a blind plunging whirlwind of
wrath and protest and speed

  it was useless for caxton to attempt
to follow he could but sit his horse at
the top of the hill and gaze in stupefied
wonder at the swift unfolding of events

  what chegnay intended to do he could
not divine indeed it is doubtful if the
austrian had any distinct idea himself
his lovers heart simply realized that its
idol was being carried away from him
and he acted upon the impulse of one
who feels that he must do something
something no matter how hopeless the
outcome

  the air-ship caxton saw had not yet
answered to its power but carried by
the wind drifted low over the squat
buildings of the arsenal and out toward
the road its drag-rope trailing behind it
like a serpent held in the talons of some
gigantic bird of prey

  out over the road the vessel drifted
then started to lift just as chegnay and
solferino whirled toward it with a clat-
ter of charging hoofs

  like a flash laszlo saw his opportu-
nity every instant the balloon was
mounting higher the end of the drag-
rope now dangled above the height of
a mans head

    springe 

  the lieutenants hands gathering up
the reins gripped down like a vise on
either side of his horses neck solferino
almost running away yet knew the fa-
miliar signal too well to disobey

  he caught himself at the very begin-
ning of another leap and bunching his
mighty muscles shot upward

  up as he had done beforethe assem-
bled thousands upon that never-to-be-
forgotten field day up like the un-
coiling of a watch-spring up and still
up in one magnificent spectacular effort

   and at the very summit of it laszlo
kicked his feet free of the stirrups let
go his clenching hold upon the bridle
and with outstretched hands seized and
clung to the dangling drag-rope which
switched just within his reach

   the chestnut unexpectedly relieved of
his burden came down to earth with an
awkward thud stumbling and slipping
but regained his footing and with un-
checked speed galloped away into the
darkness

  caxton however from his position
upon the hillside had no eyes for him
all his faculties were centered upon the
slender athletic figure of his friend
clinging cat-like to that swaying rope

  for a second tbe balloon seemed about
to settle under the added weight it
listed unsteadily curveted and sank a
dozen feet then catching the full
effect of its power together with a slight
rising of the wind it righted and shot
upward toward the stars

chapter xxl
twixt earth and sky

   ah it is well sometimes to be a trained
athlete with sinews hardened to endur-
ance and a brain accustomed to the
quick calculation of chances in an emer-
gency

  laszlo had entertained no other idea
when he seized the drag-rope but that
his weight would bring the balloon to
earth and that he could hold it there by
sheer strength until he had secured an
accounting from von altdorff and res-
cued muriel -

   now however as he felt himself lift-
ed like a feather by the expanding pres-
sure of the gas and glancing down saw
the earth dropping away from him as
though it were tumbling into space he
gave himself up for lost

  he turned sick and giddy with that
one downward look and not daring to
cast his eyes in that direction again
closed them hanging meanwhile weak
and nerveless to the slowly gyrating
rope

   his very terror though was in a way
a stimulus to him for feeling his flaccid
grip relax upon the strands and his
fingers slowly slipping his peril sent

new energy coursing through him and
he fastened upon that cord with a clutch
of desperation

   but this he knew could not last long
presently his muscles would give way
under the strain his hold would become
weakened and then would come the end
with that awful plunge downward his
brain reeled before the horror of his im-
pending fate

  no he determined fiercely he would
not sell his life so cheaply there is
always a way out of every pass if one
has but the capability to see it and the
resolution to act

  nerving himself to the experiment
he again cautiously dropped his glance
earthward no help there they were
evidently several hundred feet above
terra firma and mounting higher every
moment 

  hastily he raised his glance again
and took a deep breath gripping the
rope now until the veins stood out in
lumps upon his hands that downward
look prepared for it though he had been
bad nearly proved his undoing and he
saw he must attempt it no more

  what was there to do then could
he clamber up the rope and reach the
car swinging lightly above him hith-
erto he had hung supine in order to
relieve as much as possible the pull upon
his arms

  did he have the strength in his un-
strung condition to climb that length
of twisting rope and support himself
like a fly upon the under side of the car
until he could work up over the edge

  it seemed impossible but-and cheg-
nay gritted his teeth-it had to be done

  even in that moment of shuddering
fear however laszlo took time to think
upon the possible danger of his under-
taking to the woman he loved would
his attempt be apt to tilt the car in
which she sat and possibly precipitate
her out into space

  he noted the arrangement of the cords
by which it was held and decided that
that chance might be safely risked

  all these reflections and inward de-
batings take time in the telling but as
a matter of fact-although it seemed
centuries long to laszlo-it was not
more than forty seconds or a minute at
tbe outside from the moment that he had


the argosy

first clutched the drag-rope until he was
swarming up it hand over hand

  exercise of this sort had been one of
his favorite stunts at gymnasium prac-
tise but he found it a very different
thing to negotiate a rope whirling as a
tail to a flying balloon from ascending
the same length upon one firmly attached
and with a net underneath in case of
accident

   nevertheless under the circumstances
he made what must be considered excel-
lent progress and avas beginning to flat-
ter himself on his advance when sud-
denly he sustained another shock which
again nearly sent him tumbling and so
once more left him shaking and inert

  as he was hauling himself up with
careful skill every faculty intent upon
his feat a voice spoke to him from above

  he opened his eyes and glanced to-
ward the car but on account of the
darkness could make out  one leaning
over nor although the voice continued
to speak he  could not distinguish such
was the pounding of the blood in his
ears a single word which was said

  he supposed however that it must be
an admonition from von altdorff and
wondered with a new apprehension if
it might perhaps be a threat from his
enemy

  all along he had recognized that he
must have assistance from those in the
car in order to accomplish his project
but now it struck him withdire signifi-
cance that the air-ships pilot was his
sworn foe a madman crazed with jeal-
ousy of him

  still even a fiend would hardly re-
fuse the hand of succor to a fellow-
leing in such a predicament and in any
event he could be no worse off than he
was at present he must simply hope
for the best and go ahead

  therefore he resumed his arduous
climb

  now as a matter of fact vonalt-
dorff had just discovered the presence of
the other on the rope at the moment he
spoke and his utterance had been an
excited adjuration to hold on at any
cost

  he had not the slightest idea who
chegnay was for absorbed in the tick-
lish business of starting off neither he
nor muriel had observed that wild dash

of solferinos down into the valley and
he had simply ascribed the jerk of the
car when laszlo caught hold to the
snarling of the drag-rope against some
obstruction

  it was only indeed when the car
began to bob about under the stress of
the others energetic climbing that he
realized at last there was a stowaway
upon the voyage then he at once start-
ed to render every assistance in his
power

  and chegnay in truth was now in
sore need

  his strength was rapidly failing he
could no longer advance an inch his
arms felt as though they were being torn
out by the roots his hands were cramp-
ing so that he must soon let go

  an awful horror of that empty void
below surged over him a black haze
seemed to rise before his eyes and muffle
him in its folds for a moment he
thought he was really falling then his
vision cleared and a harbinger of hope
twinkled encouragingly to his glance it
was a tiny lantern slung over the side
in order to give him light for his ad-
venture

  he saw too that a strand of rope
with a plummeton the end was being
swung toward him pendulum-wise and
although it required all his resolution to
make the attempt he finally summoned
up bravery enough to let go for a mo-
ment with one hand and grab the line as
it swished by

   to his delight it proved to be a slip-
noose and when he had succeeded in
adjusting this under his shoulders and
felt a firm pull of support on it from
above the nothingness beneath seemed
suddenly to lose half its terror for him

  his strength came back with a bound
he felt fresh and alert again in fact
the moral support of that cord far ex-
ceeded all the physical advantages he
gained from it

   still even with all the assistance that
could be rendered him his was still far
from being any holiday job and when he
finally drew himself up to the rim of the
basket it is doubtful if there was another
ounce of exertion left in his entire frame
von altdorff putting muriel at the
other side to balance the weight as much
as possible reached out and grasping
not for sale



him under the arms dragged him into
safety

  then he lifted his lantern to the sweat-
ing haggard face of the man he had
rescued to see whom it might be but
there was a startled gasp behind him
from muriel and with a glad cry of
 laszlo  laszlo   he saw her gather
the stranger in her arms

chapter xxii

in friendly clasp

  chegnay incredulously demand-
ed the captain of the air-ship

  laszlo faint and exhausted though he
was straightened up and threw one arm
protectingly about muriels shoulder

  yes chegnay he panted here
at any cost to demand where you are
taking my affianced wife 

  he looked so fierce so ready to
spring upon the other in a savage out-
burst that muriel hurriedly thrust her-
self between them

   but laszlo laszlo she protested
eagerly  you are makings a great mis-
take i am going with captain von
altdorff of my own free will there
are excellent reasons for-

  no doubt sneeringly  but i do
not think those  excellent reasons  of
his will satisfy me he will have to
explain more fully why he has tried to
put this shame upon an honorable
woman and the one too to whom i am
betrothed

   hush laszlo and she placed an
imperatively silencing hand against his
lips  we have all cruelly misjudged
captain von altdorff and you are still
doing so he has intended no injury
to me and he is in great trouble he
is taking me to the death-bed of the
woman he loves as much as you do me

  yes it is the girl you knew as joy
van brunt but who is really muriel
bonner the actress he has loved her
and only her all the time and now she
is lying alarmingly ill with but faint
hope for her recovery she sent for me
to come to her and that is why i have
accompanied him upon this trip

   and you believe such a trumped-up
story  broke in her lover frankly skep-
tical  why-

  but again she laid her hand upon his
mouth

   i have the letter in her own hand-
writing she said

  then she drew him a little to one side

   it is a long story you have to hear
dear she continued a touch of gentle
reproof in her tone full ofmiscon-
ceptions and misunderstandings-yes and
of follies perhaps but it will do no
good to your comprehension of it con-
stantly to interrupt or to scout at the
truth of everything in it which may
sound strange to you so you must
listen quietly until the end and then you
can either believe or disbelieve as you
see fit but if i know you rightly you
will decide at its conclusion that a sin-
cere apology is due from you to captain
von altdorff

  accordingly his hand tucked in hers
he kept silence while she unfolded to
him a revelation of all that had taken
place

  she told him first of the interchange
of identities between herself and her
cousin and of the reasons which had
brought it about and although he had
heard it all from caxton before he
would not mar the sweetness of her con-
fession by letting her know for a moment
that it was a twice-told tale

  then when suitable absolution and
forgiveness had been granted under cover
of the darkness she took up the story of
joys love-affair and showed him
plainly that there had never been any
real question of rivalry between himself
and von altdorff

   he has loved her from the begin-
ning said muriel  just as you have
loved me  and when he believed from
papas blundering answer that he had
lost her he was roused to a pitch of
jealous frenzy just as you would have
been if you thought you had lost me

   she came to the arsenal that- very
morning and unfortunately saw fit to
coquette with him a balloon was short-
ly to be sent up roused almost to the
point of distraction maddened by her
seeming rebuffs he induced her to enter
the basket then took her aloft with him
and carried her away none but a few
of his workmen were about and he could
trust them to keep silence

  he took her to an estate of his a
	the argosy

 lonely place in the mountains near
 gmunden and left her there in the
 charge of his housekeeper she pretend-
 ed to be incensed with him for carrying
 her off that she would not listen to his
 protestations and he left telling her
 that lie would return to vienna get a
 priest and marry her by force that
 was the very thing she wanted him to do
 as a matter of fact for she did not dare
 risk confessing to him who she really
 was and she had been trying by her
 assumed coldness to spur him to this very
 point

    but richly have they both had to
 pay for their follies muriel continued
 with a sad shake of her head  his
 air-ship the only one he had capable of
 making a distance as far as gmunden
 broke down upon the return journey
 and since his estate is in a wild spot
 inaccessible to either telegraph or tele-
 phone he was unable to send any word

     then she believing that he had de-
 serted her fell into violent hysterics last-
 ing a day and night and when he did
 finally get back he found her raving in
 the delirium of brain-fever

     since that time his condition has
 been a pitiable one he knew that he
 was shadowed by our detectives and has
 lived constantly in fear of being arrested
 for the crime of her abduction he has
 not dared to go to gmunden news
 from there has reached him but slowly
 and between fearing for her and fearing
 the consequences of his mad act his life
 has-been one continual inferno

    last night he could stand it no
 x longer however but risked everything
 and took the trip and to his joy at first
 he found her conscious conscious and
 in a more chastened sweeter humor than
 he had ever known

     she still refused though to receive
 his vows of love until she had complete-
 ly unbosomed herself of all the story of
 her deceptions and when he had as-
 sured her that none of it made any differ-
 ence to his affection she fell then to
 weeping and confessing that she too
 loved him yet told him that it could
 never be since the doctor had shortly
 before informed her that she would prob-
 ably not get well

     she urged him also to carry a letter
 to me and although it tore his heart to

leave her he did so in it she asked me
to come to her if possible but whether
i did so or not to see that he was fully
absolved from all blame in connection
with her disappearance or death

   i of course agreed to comply with
her request and merely stopping to leave
a hasty note for papa hurried back with
captain von altdorff to the arsenal
the rest you know

  the conversation between laszlo and
muriel had been carried on almost in
whispers at one side of the car but now
as she finished and chegnay glanced
somewhat curiously at the figure of their
pilot the thought struck him that they
might have screamed at the top of their
voices for all the difference it would
have made to him

  entirely oblivious of them he was
leaning forward over the front of the
car now adjusting a lever now tighten-
ing a belt his one thought to get the
most speed out of his delicate and com-
plicated machinery his eyes only turn-
ing from the steady beat of his engines
to gaze with strained yearning toward
gmunden

   it was daylight when at last they ar-
rived the peaks all about them tinging
with the rosy light of dawn

   to the south towered the lofty dach-
stein with its little glacier and cap of
virgin snow and nearer at hand toward
the left loomed up the rugged mass of
the traunstein while the foreground was
filled up with the pine-covered salzburg
alps through a ridge in which rushed
the traun foaming in cascade after cas-
cade-down to meet the danube

  upon one of the wildest most deso-
late summits the air-ship settled slowly
and von altdorff only his haggard eyes
showing the anxiety which wras gnawing
at his heart assisted his passengers to
alight and led them hurriedly over a
rocky path through the pine forest back
to the house a mere shooting-box erected
many years before

  on tiptoe scarcely knowing what to
expect for the housekeeper was with the
invalid and nobody else about they fol-
lowed him to the sick-chamber and just
as they entered saw the sun break through
the eastern window in a flood of golden
glory

  it shone full upon the pallid face
not for sale



of the sick woman sending a thousand
glints into her waving hair and giving
a delicate spiritual beauty to her face
which she had hitherto lacked

  the old dame in atteiidance rose quick-
ly to draw the shade but joy already
had opened her eyes and was gazing with
rapturous half-incredulous glance at
von altdorff

   oh felix felix  she cried  i
have been waiting and longing for you
so to tell you the good news love is
a wonderful medicine my own and the
doctor now tells me that i shall get
well

  muriel touched laszlo upon the hand
and making a sign to the old woman
the three of them withdrew leaving the
ecstatic pair alone

  a little later the captain came out to
them and one would never have known
that he had passed a night of sleepless-
ness and anguish he looked as though
twenty years had dropped from his shoul-
ders and he greeted them with a laugh
like a boys

   my congratulations to you dear old
felix cried chegnay extending his
hand

  and mine to you returned von alt-
dorff grasping it with hearty pressure

  so the feud between them was made up

chapter xxiii

caxtons secret

  there is a lilting waltz air which has
been played sung hummed and whis-
tled by thousands of people but which
still retains its popularity through a
quality it possesses of a peculiarly quaint
and delicate beauty

  ask any street-boy for its name and
he will tell you it is the waltz-motif from
 for the red ribbon   yet it also re-
mains a marked favorite with connois-
seurs and musicians of ability even
the table dhote orchestras cannot utterly
spoil it

  it has been played in almost every
theater in this country and europe but
the first time it was even rendered was
in the burg theater at vienna with
the composer in the conductors chair
and his wife taking the stellar role

  it was a great occasion which even

royalty had deigned to honor for it was
rumored that despite the fact it was a
new production it would mark the fare-
well to the stage of muriel bonner the
great vienna favorite she having con-
sented to appear for this one night only

  and what a success it was and what
a surprise came on top of it when it was
learned that muriel bonner was in reality
the daughter of cyrus van brunt the
millionaire while the real owner of the
name was the dashing young lady who
a few weeks before had married captain
von altdorff

  but all that is ancient history every-
body knows the story of the first produc-
tion of  for the red ribbon and of
the romance which crowned the life of
its gifted young composer

  only one person dissented from the
general verdict of praise for the piece at
that first production and of hearty good
wishes for the young couple with whom
it was associated

  that was-max horowitz and he was
so resentful of the fact that he had been
cheated of spreading this sensation that
he was like a viper swelled out with
venom

   yes he said superciliously in the
foyer  the critics seem to be applauding
a little but as for me im free to con-
fess that i never sat through such a bore-
some thing in all my life then the
yankee actress is so rotten its plain
to be seen that those stories of her having
been drilled like an automaton for mile
modiste  are all true its certainly
lucky for her that shes an heiress and
doesnt have to stay on the stage and
still luckier for chegnay hell never
make his salt writing operas

  is that so cut in caxton who
happened to have overheard this last
remark  well i just heard one of the
greatest critics in the world say that he
would rather have chegnays talent than
all of his father-in-laws copper mines
and as for muriel there is not now nor
ever was a woman who could touch her
on the stage or off of it either

   oh its not hard to understand your
approval of her sneered horowitz
 you are in love with her yourself and
always have been

   gee   reflected the american  am
t beginning to show it so bad that even


the argosy

a little cad like this can notice it if
so it is certainly lucky i am leaving for
columbias shores to-morrow whats
the use caxton she would never have
had you and that ends the matter

  aloud however his remarks were of
a different tenor

   look here shrimp he said tower-
ing threateningly over the hussar  if
you ever dare to breathe utter say or
even think such a thing again ill come

half-way across the world and spend six
months in jail just for the pleasure of
dusting your pants once more

   and oh horowitz he added gloat-
ingly  what a spanking that will be
what a spanking that will be 

  but the gossip had shrunk back terri-
fied before the flashing eye and sternly
set face bent toward him

    never will say it mein lierr he
shrieked  i never will even think it

                               the end

why galway lost his temper

                     by robert russell

                        this man certainly appeared to have some
                        justification for getting mad but yet -

galway was a very nice fellow
and his friends always forgave
the rare outbursts of temper which were
the only evident faults to which he was
obliged to plead guilty it was on one
of the hottest days of a hot august that
he gave way to this temper under par-
ticularly exasperating circumstances

  it was to be a momentous day for
him and as he entered the large jew-
elry store for the purpose of having his
pocketbook repaired he was full of an-
ticipation for the evening

  the establishment had manufactured
the valuable case and was one well
known throughout the country boasting
a maze of departments it was not to
be wondered at therefore that galway
did not seek to ascertain the location of
the repair counter himself but accosted
a floor-walker for the information

   at the rear of the store responded
that dignified official

  to the rear therefore went the young
man looking about him in this local-
ity galway read all sorts of signs none
of which included the word  repairs
being a resolute person and not to be
side-tracked or inclined to shift respon-
sibility he returned to the front of the
store and again addressed the man whom
he had previously interviewed

   what part of the rear contains the
repair department   he asked without
the slightest trace of impatience

   it is directly in the rear returned
the dignitary- up a flight of stairs
back went galway

  reaching the very back part of the
establishment he spied a small stair-
case and started to ascend it it was
a long flight and he wondered that an
establishment which catered to such a
fashionable clientele would put its pa-
trons to such trouble over a matter of
repairs

  at length he reached the top and
was confronted by a row of forbidding
doers and again the sign  repairs 
was missing desiring to be sure that
the department was not here and anx-
ious that the slight indignation which
now began to manifest itself should not
be unjustified galway spoke to a young
man who passed him at that moment

   i am looking for the repair depart-
ment he said rather irritably  is it
on this floor

  no sir replied the other it is
 the floor below reached by a short
stairway-only a few steps up

   ah soliloquized galway  its a
wonder that they could not be more ex-
plicit

  as he descended the long stairway his
impatience gradually rose so that by the
time he gained the ground floor again
his vexation combined with the heat of
the day made him feel a decidedly
abused person
why galway lost his temper



  he was very careful now to examine
the full length of the rear of the store
and at last discovered a short flight of
stairs at the top of which appeared a
counter that looked as if it might lend
itself to repairing

  galway presented himself at this
counter in due course his voice was
low as he spoke

  is this the repair department he
inquired

  yes sir what can i do for you
 i am glad commented galway
 that after several trips up and down
your store and after mounting innumer-
able stairs i have at last found the
place i want it does seem strange that
in an establishment like this a man can-
not be properly directed in the first
place i-

   i am very sorry sir that you have
been put to any inconvenience and if
you will make a complaint at the man-
agers- office the firm will be under
obligation to you who directed you
wrongly 

   a greatly overdressed man who
stands at the front of -the store in the
first place and the same individual in
the second place you are the first in-
telligent employee i have met in the
establishment

   do as i suggest sir and i assure
you the person who is responsible will
lie severely reprimanded and now
what can i do for you

   i have here said galway  a card-
case made by your firm and which i
cherish very highly the lining has
worn out and i have brought it here
to be repaired i trust that you will be
as expeditious as possible

  the young man behind the counter
took the case in his hands and held it
a moment with a perplexed look on his
face then he spoke hesitatingly

   i am very sorry sir again to put
you to trouble but you see this depart-
ment does all the repairing except-this
fine leather-work you will find that
department on the south side of the
building

  it was now that galway forgot all
about the pleasurable evening in store
for him and ceased attempting to con-
trol his wrath

   again   he cried  whoever heard

of an establishment like this dividing up
its departments in that way here
you he called to a young man passing
at that moment  you look as though
you had some authority in this place
tell me the name of the clothes-model
who stands at the front of the store
and tell me this mans name who refuses
to repair my card-case and tell me who
is the proper person to whom a com-
plaint should be made of carelessness
and-

  of course galway carried the thing
too far but remember his temper-
and the heat

  the passing young man whom gal-
way had grasped by the arm forcefully
removed the hand and looked at the
customer from head to foot

   if you will be calm a moment he
said slowly  i will be glad to answer
any questions you may ask

  but the fact that the other had ac-
tually taken hold of him made galway
more incensed than ever

   and you might include your own
name also young man he exploded
 i am not accustomed to being taken
hold of by jewelry salesmen

   my name is prentice replied the
other  and i am hardly a salesman-
but that does not matter if you do
not desire to talk reasonably i will
show you to the department which will
attend to your card-case - and suggest
that you go to mr crofty himself with
your complaint he is at present some
fifty miles from any railroad in the
adirondacks - you might possibly have
assumed a rational bearing by the time
you reached him this way sir

  galway was a really decent fellow
and as he followed prentice muttering
that he would immediately leave the
place were it not for the fact that
crofty  co had made the case he be-
gan to realize that he had been a little
hasty

  there was no evidence of repentance
in his bearing however as lie handed
over the card-case to the proper per-
son left his name and address and
quitted the store

  outside the sun was blistering hot
and it was not until galway had some-
what cooled his burning body by means
of a cold glass of mineral water that he


the argosy

again began to think of the pleasure in
store for him that evening

  in the spring he had left at its most
interesting stage an affair of the heart
which was not only his first but which
consumed him with even a greater in-
tensity than his miserable temper miss
ailing was now to be in town for a
week and he had persuaded her over the
telephone to dine with him that evening
her house was closed for the summer
and he considered it a great honor that
she had dropped him a note asking him
to call at the hotel where she was stop-
ping with friends and he was en-
thralled when she had so far overlooked
the conventionalities as to accept his in-
vitation for dinner

  he was due to call for her at seven
it was now only five but he hastened
to his near-by apartment in order to be
punctuality itself and to remind her
that the two months which had passed
since he had seen her in nowise changed
the intensity of his feelings

   lets see he said to himself as he
entered his room and closed the door
 how long must i allow to reach her
hotel

  he reached for his card-case

   oh of course i left the case at
croftys to be fixed- her hotel is the
-the-the- and the young man
stood still-thinking

   of course i know it he went on
it begins with a  v -the west-
moreland - no - the weland - no she
wouldnt stop there-the-the- and
again the perspiration gathered on gal-
ways brow	

  with a sudden inspiration he seized
the telephone-book and began searching
for all the hotels the names of which
began with  w unsuccessful here
he spent many more minutes looking
haphazard for the names of other hotels
and finally threw down the book with
the most hopeless ejaculation

  then he began a search of his pockets
for the note which would give the re-
quired clue nothing to be found-he
must have left it in the miserable card-
case

  yes he was sure of that now and
after a hasty glance at his watch he as-
certained that with haste he might be
able to reach the store before they closed

  regardless of wilted collar and ex-
tremely uncomfortable clothing he start-
ed in hot haste for the establishment of
crofty  co the massive front door
was just being shut as he got there

   closed sir said the watchman

   but i must see some one in author-
ity insisted galway

  at that moment there emerged from
the entrance the well-dressed fioor-walker
who had been the means -of galways
previous irritation the latter quickly
approached him

   i left a card-case here this after-
noon to be repaired-and it is very neces-
sary that i obtain a paper from it

   i remember the occasion well re-
plied the other  but it is too late now
 but it is most important-is there
no way 

  the dignified young man looked at
galway with something of satisfaction
in his eyes

   no sir he said  every one has
left and-

  as luck would have it at that instant
prentice who really seemed to be a per-
son in authority in the establishment
appeared from another entrance and ap-
proached the trio

  ah he ejaculated not with satis-
faction but with interest  the repair
department 

   sir began galway now all humil-
ity  i lost my temper this afternoon
but at present i have discovered that i
left in the card-case which is now in
your possession a paper which it is most
important i see at once will you do
me the favor of finding out if it is still
there - they cannot have begun work
upon the case yet  

  the tall young man looked at galway
with the same calm interest and amuse-
ment which had possessed his features
when he suggested a trip into the moun-
tains to find mr crofty and replied
good-humoredly

   we all lose our tempers occasionally
come with me and i will see what i
can do

  together they entered the building
and went at once to the repair depart-
ment which it had taken galway so long
to find here they discovered a con-
scientious workman still laboring over a
delicate piece of leather
why galway lost his temper



    the situation was soon explained and
  after a long search the card-case dis-
  covered-empty

     you must have taken everything out
  of it sir said prentice

     i thought i did admitted galway
   but when  could not find the paper
   wanted i thought it must be here-
  but-do you mind telling me all the
  hotels you know with names beginning
  with  w   

    prentice looked at galway in aston-
  ishment  and as they left the building
  his sense of humor could no longer with-
  stand the incongruity of galways former
  confident anger and his present humility
  after a quiet laugh however he sug-
  gested two or three and then spoke of
  looking them up in the teleplione-book

     oh ive done that cried the dis-
  tracted young man  thank you for
  your kindness he had the grace to add

    slowly and with a broken spirit gal-
  way returned to his apartment as the
  clock struck the hour of seven and he
  v realized that somewhere in that great
  city the girl of his heart was waiting for
  him to take her out to dinner the place
  had never seemed so desolate

     dinner by himself the thought
  disgusted him but finally as the same
  clock was striking the hour of nine he
  realized that nature must be fortified
  and he rose to go out to partake of
  some food

    he wanted lights and coolness-to get
  far away from his accustomed haunts
  and he took a car for a distant dining-
  place on the banks of the river

    there were lights there a plenty and
  quiet corners out-of-doors where he
  could imagine himself sitting with miss
  ailing-and he would be sitting thus
  too as soon as she called him up on
  the following day to hear his explana-
  tion but he sat alone now watching
  the lights on the river and hearing faint-
  ly the low spoken words of the couples
  occupying the quiet corners

    he had finished his dinner and was
  about to leave for his lonely apartment
  when he fancied he heard his name
  spoken yes there it was again and
  coming from one of the deliciously
  shaded dining-places

    with some curiosity galway rose and
  walked in the direction of the sound

      a

there sitting where just a ray of the
electric lights fell upon her face sat
helen ailing and beyond her in the
darkness a man

  without a moments hesitation galway
spoke to her

   you must have thought it awfully
strange helen that  did not call for
you-but i lost your address and-

  the girl interrupted him

   i knew it was something like that
and waited till nine oclock when i
callcd up your apartment on the tele-
phone its all right of course-we can
dine together some other evening - i
wanted to tell you something-perhaps
i can do it now-but first let me present
you-

  all eagerness galway bowed to the
young man in the darkness and turned
again to the girl

   first of all helen let me write
down the name of the hotel where you
are stopping and he looked in vain for
a paper on which to inscribe it

  at last crumpled up in his trousers
pocket he found a scrap and hurriedly
drew it out

   its the windmere said the girl-
 a new place not yet even in the tele-
phone-book but awfully nice and now
let me tell you why i wanted to see you
so much you are my oldest friend in
the city - and - and i wanted you to
know of my engagement this with
a little wave of her hand toward the
man in the darkness  is the happy
man-

  but galway was looking at the slip
of paper on which he had written the
address it was her note to him bearing
her hotel telephone number on the back
of which was written the names of the
three culprits of the afternoon and
then he remembered his consuming anger
at the moment he had jotted them down
-and the last name-was prentice

  the tall man came out of the dark-
ness

   i had the pleasure of meeting mr
galway this afternoon he said with a
twinkle in his eye

  it was prentice

   good night said galway tearing
into little bits the note he had received
from miss ailing

  then lie hurried from the spot

 the prison at santa rosa

the prison at santa rosa was not
an imposing piece of architecture
but it was certainly a prison i had fre-
quently ridden by it in days when  had
no idea that i should ever be incarcerated
there and  had felt great sympathy
for the poor devils who were prisoners
whether guilty of crime or not

  it was a low one-story building-at
least only one story above the level of
the ground-and was built of adobe
blocks its cold unornamented front
faced the road that led out along the rio
rico and the rear of the prison was on
the edge of the river-bank

  the cells or dungeons as they were
called were as balover had written mis-
erable holes they had almost no venti-
lation and but little light the principal
prisoners were kept in the cells under-
ground from which there was no escape

  the building surrounded an open
court or patio which would be called in
the united states a prison-yard here
the executions were held

  it was the custom in santa rosa when
any great offender was shot to march all
the prisoners out into the patio and ar-
range them  three sides leaving the
blank wall at one end to receive the bul-
lets that did not lodge in the body of the
victim

  it was about midnight when we
reached the prison my wounds were
now quite painful and i was so weak i
hardly cared what they did with me
afterward if they would only let me have
a little rest then

  we were admitted and the head keeper
of the place was aroused he received
us in a little office

 began february argosy

 your name he demanded taking
 up a large book in which he kept a record
 of prisoners

  robert fraser i answered

 your business here

  in the prison i asked

  in santa rosa he said with a
 heavy frown

  i am a physician and chemist i
 was sent here by a new york society to
 study certain plants and barks

  and having been assured of your
 hospitality you abused it

  i did not i have committed no
 crime at all

  ha you and your countrymen have
 strange ideas of crime we will give you
 a lesson we have already your partner
 in crime put them together he said
 to another keeper  let them console
 each other they will leave here together
 for-

 he did not finish his sentence but a
 cold chill ran through me as i realized
 what he meant

   am wounded i explained  may
 i not have some attention 

  we have no surgeon here anyway
 a few wounds more or less will make no
 difference in the end

 with this brutal remark he waved to
 the keepers and i was hustled down a
 flight of stone steps

 by the light of a lantern a door was
 unlocked and i saw balover lying on a
 pile of dirty straw in a corner of a filthy
 cell

  in with you said one of the keep-
 ers and in a moment the door was closed
 and i was left in perfect darkness

  balover i said

 what what who is that is it
 -it cant be fraser  replied balover

  it is fraser i said

 single copies  cents
trouble in bunches

   what is it-a plot-a plan to get
me out he asked eagerly

   it was to be i answered   but
like all the rest of the business ive made
a mess of it i did leave odonnells
camp to come and help you but i am
worse off than you are i am wounded
and i have lost don manuels money

   then its all up with you too he
said

  there was no recrimination-no mur-
muring nor fault-finding balover was
as brave a fellow as i had ever seen

  if you are wounded he went on
 lie down on this straw it isnt very
clean nor very dry but its better than
the floor

  i lay down alongside of him and so
great was my exhaustion that even while
he was speaking to me i fell asleep

  when i awoke i saw the miserable con-
dition of the place we were in and the
effect his imprisonment was having on
balover his eyes were sunken and dim
his cheeks hollow and white with a sickly
look all over his face

   they dont need to shoot a man
here i remarked  all that is neces-
sary is to keep him here hell die soon
enough

    wish theyd hurry up and have it
over said balover  i see no hope of
getting out in some way these fools have
got it into their heads that we are great
criminals you cant drive any sense
into them they are densely ignorant
and hate us for our nationality i
thought all south america liked the
states but santa rosa hates us there
is no doubt that i am to be shot and
as they have put you in with me i sup-
pose that will be your fate

   i tried to see our consul but he was
on board some ship in the harbor i
explained  if we could only com-
municate with him he might do some-
thing

   ph the consul at santa rosa cant
do anything he never did odonnell
might but  reckon hes got about all
he can do to stay here and keep out of
prison he never comes into santa
rosa

  they brought us our breakfast i will
not attempt to tell what it was because
i dont know it was a nauseating mess
anyway but we knew we must eat



   if we dont eat and an opportunity
to escape should offer we wouldnt be
able to take it i said

   opportunity to escape  balover
echoed  who ever heard of escaping
from one of these burial holes 

   but that messenger you sent with
your letter escaped

   true but he was a minor prisoner
and wasnt down here he had the run
of the prison-court and had people out-
side to help him

   cant we bribe somebody there to
pass letters for us  i asked

   we can try it

  we watched the little iron grating
balover had mentioned in his letter for
hours  one came near it then two men
were walking past and stopped right over
the grating to continue their conversa-
tion

   theyve got the two americans
said one  both in the underground
dungeon i heard the captain say they
were to be shot i dont know when

  i had not been searched when i en-
tered they do not always attend to
those things in a south american prison
at night my revolver had been taken
from me but i still had some money i
poked a piece of gold through the
grating

   scfiors i called softly

   who spoke   asked one of the two
 did you not hear a voice 

   i click some one said  seilorsah
the american down here-see  

  i saw both their faces as they peered
down at me	

  will you carry a letter for us i
asked  we will pay you well

   it is impossible said the one who
had spoken before  i would not at-
tempt it everybody is watched the
order has gone forth that you are to be
shot any person caught with a letter
from you would also be shot farewell
senors

  with that the two walked off

chapter xix

dynamite

  my heart sank it is no pleasant thing
to realize that you are to die within a
short time i suppose a person after


the argosy

months or years of suffering welcomes
such knowledge as the forerunner of a
blessed relief

  but two young men with everything
to live for could hardly be expected to
look upon the prospect with equanimity

  yet never in all the time that has
passed since then during which  have
practised my profession have i seen any-
one face death with the cool almost inso-
lent courage of jim balover

   i hope as long as they are going to
shoot us they will shoot us together he
remarked  even in death i suppose a
fellow likes company

   i cant see that it makes any differ-
ence i rejoined  it will be over in
a minute these fellows dont leave any
blanks as they do in time of war in our
army when they shoot a man every-
body shoots to kill one little order and
its all over

   it wouldnt be so bad he went on
 if it wasnt for the two girls i sup-
pose of course isobel is safe-some-
where-but its tough going and leaving
her when i know she loves me

   it is  feel the same way

  you are you in love is it kate 
 yes i answered with a sigh  it
is kate and she seems to love me i
came after reading your letter and we
bade each other a fond good - by on
her part it was almost a farewell because
she feared some disaster but i was
going to do wonders kick up a shindy
with the consul give old don manuel
back his money and win his friendship
and have you out of here in no time what
have i done lost don manuels money
got myself cut up into beefsteaks and
here i am now waiting to be shot like
a mad dog kate was right ive done
nothing but mess everything since i tried
to take isobel to you

   oh dont blame yourself for that it
was my fault in the first place i had
no business to ask you to help me and
i should have told you about kate

   im glad you didnt i am sorry you
have not seen isobel but the kiss kate
gave me when i came away is worvh a
great deal

  it isnt worth getting shot for

   well-there is no use arguing about
that if we could only-

   well we cant ive tried every-

thing ive threatened them with men-
of-war ive tried to bribe them with all
the money my uncle is worth ive prom-
ised them good positions in the states
ive done everything the trouble is we
are too prominent if we were obscure
no-account devils we might get out as
it is-bang

  cheerful talk in a damp dark cell
but our spirits were not quite as lively
as our talk our minds were keyed up to
the breaking-point and if in the attempt
to appear calm we slopped over some-
times it could hardly be called unnat-
ural

  that day passed wearily evidently
they were in no hurry to finish their job
there was no gloating over us no abusive
language no one came near us at all
except to bring what they called food

 we slept but little that night

    fraser said balover as we lay side
by side on the straw  ive got a peculiar
feeling that you are going to get out of
this and i am not i dont know what
makes me feel that way but i do and
i want you to promise me something

    ill promise anything i told him
 it is easy to promise when you know
you cant fulfil i fail to see any reason
for such an idea as you have if you
are shot of course ill be

  well i dont know i hope im
right anyway if you do escape by any
miracle hunt till you find isobel tell
her that her name was the last word on
my lips and assure her of my love

    ill do that-but if i have a chance
to do it you will yourself

   we spent the night mostly in talking
in this way and were worn out when
morning came

   while we were eating our breakfast a
cloud came over the grating and a piece
of paper dropped to the floor

    ah a friend has found us out  ex-
claimed balover

  he sprang forward and picked up the
paper

   as he opened it i saw in the dim light
that his face turned paler

    what is it   i asked

    not a message from a friend he re-
plied

  i took the paper it was printed in
spanish and was a general order to be
scattered or posted in various places
trouble in bunches



  the purport of it was that the two no-
torious americans-and our crimes were
all mentioned and magnified-had been
captured and would be shot in the
prison - yard at two oclock in the
morning

  there was a choking and stifled feel-
ing in my throat it had not been so
difficult to be calm when there was hope
of escape but with this hope gone with
the notice of our execution in my hands
all my calmness seemed to leave me

  poor kate poor kate i mur-
mured  how i would like to see you
once more before  die i doubt now
balover if it was right for me to let her
know i loved her

   well you couldnt help it could
you how can you hide love im
sorry that isobel loves me now yet-i
dont know its something of a com-
fort

  small comfort it was to me to know
that the girl whose love i had won and
from whom i had had only that farewell
kiss was to be left grieving in the wilds
of south america i knew she was safe
now with odonnell but my thoughts
were far from cheerful

  that day was the most miserable i ever
experienced every hour that brought
us nearer the terrible ending of our lives
made us more depressed

  at last we gave up trying to carry on
any conversation and just paced back
and forth in the dungeon glancing down
at the floor as we passed each other
neither daring to look each other in the
face lest both should break down and
give way to our pent-up feelings

  at noon we received our dinner it
was better than the meals we had been
given before and wte ate it i dont know
why but all men condemned to death do
eat heartily

  and at supper - time we had another
good meal then darkness fell

  it was now merely a question of a few
hours if we had had any hope that the
consul would act in our behalf that hope
vanished with the daylight we knew
no official work would be done after
nightfall

  oh what a dreary horrible waiting
waiting for ths summons to follow a
guide to the patio and there stand up to
be shot dead 

   we heard the great bell in the santa
rosa cathedral chime the hour of mid-
night

   two hours more  i heard balover
mutter  only two hours more to live

   those two hours were dismal and long
but at last they were over

  we heard a drum the ground in
which our cell was dug seemed to tremble
with the tramp of feet

    it is time said balover  a few
minutes and all will be-

   suddenly there was a terrific explo-
sion detonation after detonation split
the air the ground seemed to heave
upward japing holes were made in the
top of our cell as the earth and stone
and adobe came crashing through

   the ships have bombarded the
town  cried balover grasping my arm

   it did not seem like a bombardment to
me the explosions seemed to be in the
prison itself

    whatever it is i said  heres a hole
big enough to crawl through come on
it cant be any -worse even if we are
caught

  we wriggled ourselves up through a
hole and found ourselves in the long hall
of the prison men were rushing about
with lanterns shouting cursing and try-
ing to find out what was the matter

  we were not noticed nobody paid
any attention to us everybody was
scared out of his wits

   we reached the road

    run i said to balover- run for
your life lets get back to odonnells
camp

   we started beyond the prison there
was a dark clump of woods as we ran
along the road from these woods a figure
darted toward us

   bob jim wait weve got horses

  great heaven it was kate arnold
and then from the trees leading two
horses came mary odonnell

    we didnt dare bring any more we
can ride these two and hurry said kate

  we wasted no time but balover took
mary and i took kate and we bounded
away

   i dont understand how you hap-
pened to be there when the explosion
took place i said to kate when we had
gone far enough to slacken our pace a
little

t


the argosy

   vve were the explosion replied
kate  didnt you know what that
was well that was dynamite mary
knew where her father kept it he had
to go up in the hills last evening and a
passing hunter gave us the notice of your
execution mary and i were frantic for
a time and i happened to say id like to
blow up the old prison mary said
 lets well to make a short story of
it we took the dynamite and shattered
the jail thank god we didnt hurt you
but you were going to be shot anyway
we took the chance of either getting you
out or killing you

  here was a girl i hugged her as we
hurried to the mining camp

  there was of course a sensation but
with horses loaned us by odonnell and
a guide who knew a roundabout way to
the border we started on a long journey
to argentina

  we reached the plate river and found
a boatman who would take us to buenos
ayres

  at buenos ayres we rested and on the
morning following our arrival kate and
i talked over our affairs

   ive got money enough i said
 and a profession you are practically
mistress of your own affairs why wait
let us go to the united states embassy
and be married

  she agreed

  we were courteously received at the
embassy

   i think we know all about you said
a high official  we have even now as
a guest a young lady from santa rosa
she has interested the ambassador in the
matter but we feared it would be too
late anyway you are in safe hands
now

   who is the young lady  i asked in
surprise

   why-senorita isobel fernandez
the daughter of the old don she ran
away from home rather than go to spain
and sought refuge here learning that
she was engaged to marry an american
of course we gave her our most hearty
protection

  in ten minutes isobel was in balovers
arms and there were two weddings in-
stead of one

  you can imagine the rest-the long ex-
planations the laughter and the tears
though there was little to cry about
except joy

  we sailed for new york where we
gtill are a little older but just as happy
and balover and i are both prosperous

  we often argue i insist that i did
not give him any assistance when he
asked it and he insists that i did i leave
you to judge

                               the end

a millionaires dilemma

                  by m gertrude miller

                  how a wealthy californian came to run amuck
                  in a new york hotel noted for its quiet elegance

when sam johnson registered at
denver or chicago hotels every-
body got busy and the best room in the
house was at his disposal for be it
known that from chicago to the coast
sam johnson was popularly known as
the  mining king

  it was therefore from force of habit
that upon reaching new york late one
saturday afternoon in the teeth of a
northwest blizzard he looked about him
as he alighted from the cab to see how
many of the  boys as he termed re-

porters might be waiting for him the
capitalist whom he had come east to
meet in connection with a railroad deal
had however designated a quiet hotel
in order to keep the matter out of the
papers and johnsons arrival attracted
no attention

  the clerk appeared no more con-
cerned by the bold signature  sam
johnson california than if he had
signed john doe new york and
indeed beyond a certain freedom of
movement gained in the open there was
a millionaires dilemma



little in johnsons personal appearance
to indicate the magnate

  upon learning his name the clerk
handed him a telegram which had just
come with the aid of his code-key
johnson grasped the fact that the
storm had delayed this wire which
stated that the gentleman he had come
to see had concluded to meet him in
chicago instead of new york john-
son gave utterance to an exclamation of
annoyance then philosophically decided
that now he was here he might as well
take in the allurements of the  great
white way with this end in view
immediately upon reaching his room he
examined the contents of his pocket-
book

   by george i must have blown a
roll  he said to himself when he found
just a dollar in loose change

  he however took out his check-book
with the easy assurance of a man on
good terms with his bankers mentally
calculating that five hundred would do
 as a starter he accordingly signed
the check with that peculiar series of
little kinks and flourishes affected by
moneyed men

   i didnt bring much cash with me
he said pleasantly as he handed the
check a few moments later to the clerk

  that individual puckered his brow
and after a whispered consultation with
the manager promptly returned it

   we dont cash out-of-town checks
for strangers he said shortly

  johnsons cheerful smile vanished

   do you know who i am  he thun-
dered

  the clerk smiled superciliously

   i dont care a rap who you are he
remarked indifferently  rules are
rules

   may i ask if you are in the habit
of insulting your guests

  a certain glint in the californians
eye unpleasantly suggestive of firearms
warned the clerk and he spoke in a
conciliatory tone

   if you can find anybody to identify
you we might accommodate you

  as johnson sauntered over toward the
telephone-booth which was presided
over by a haughty young woman attired
in a princesse gown his thoughts were
working overtime by a strange freak

of fate he had no new york acquaint-
ances outside of the millionaire class

  the girl at the switchboard opened
her eyes when johnson asked her to call
up henry abbott she knew the ab-
botts had sailed for europe that morn-
ing for the  society  column was
daily perused by her but experience
had warned her not to make suggestions

   the riviera for the winter was
the curt information at the other end
of the wire

   ah-too bad-i had hoped to see
the old man while l was here try
william thayer

  thayers was a name to conjure with
in the east but he had seemed a small
man when sam johnson put him up
at the leading frisco club and enter-
tained him at his ranch

   egypt-been gone a month was
the laconic answer of the caretaker at
the thayer residence

  seven other gentlemen of equal so-
cial and financial eminence were sug-
gested but with equally futile results
some were on the atlantic one yachting
in the caribbean-all were unavailable
for purposes of identification

  when sam johnson had paid for
these calls he found himself down to
ten cents and for the moment at a loss
what to do next so absorbed was he
in his own thoughts that he failed to
observe the curious glance bestowed upon
him by the priestess of the switchboard

  a sudden idea came to him as he
strolled across the lobby why not try
to dispose of his return ticket to sail
francisco he decided to breast the
gale and make the attempt

  it would have been an eye-opener
to say the least eouki he have heard
the conversation at the desk as the re-
volving door swung to behind him

   say whatever you got hold of
now asked the telephone girl is
he an anarchist or just crazy why
hes called up nine of the richest men
in new york-said he knew them inti-
mately - and the papers have all told
they were out of town

  the clerk glanced up interested  i
dont like his looks either he re-
marked   but well gamble on him till
monday morning and then itll either
be cash up or get out


the argosy

  as sam johnson crossed over into the
avenue he had considerable trouble in
keeping his feet against the rapidly in-
creasing storm the street lamps shone
dimly through the snow for the first
time in twenty years he was without
money in a big city

  he smiled rather grimly at the irony
of fate-a penniless millionaire what
a newspaper story it would make but
meantime he must get some cash a
railroad ticket - office informed him it
would take some time perhaps a week
to arrange about the ticket and johnson
turned angrily on his heel

  contrary to the usual run of self-
made men johnson was without osten-
tation in his dress and wore no jewelry
except a pearl scarf-pin and a watch
the former was a present from his wife
for a moment the handsome interior of
his dining-room at home flashed before
his mind and a vision of the one woman
in the world lonely in all her luxury
because he was not there no he could
not pawn the scarf-pin

  the watch was a gift from some fel-
low miners on the day they all struck
luck together he remembered how
awkwardly they had made the presenta-
tion yet how sincere a tribute of affec-
tion it was he would starve rather than
part with that memento of the past

 a hotel on the corner gave him a new
inspiration

   by jove ill wire bill adams  col-
lect  for funds he thought

  bill had been the spokesman of the
watch donors sam johnson laughed to
himself as he thought of that gentleman
now the meek husband of one of chi-
cagos social meteors

   sorry sir said the western union
operator  but theres another blizzard
starting in on the track of this one and
the wires are down you can leave the
message if you like and take your
chances we may be able to reach chi-
cago by monday

   and i have the reputation of being
a lucky fellow johnson reflected bit-
terly as he turned away from the tele-
graph-office i

  the lobby was filled with well-dressed
people bound to theater and opera and
he mingled with them hoping to find
among that throng some familiar face

but not one person had he ever seen be-
fore

  as he stood on the steps watching the
last motor whirl away johnson realized
how a fellow down and out on his luck
must feel looking on at a prosperous
pleasure-seeking crowd with whom he
has nothing in common

   why my check for a hundred thou-
sand would be honored anywhere from
chicago to frisco he reflected  and
here i am in new york as destitute as
a hobo

  with a sigh for the play he must
forego sam johnson hurried back to his
hotel suddenly recollecting he had not
dined

   im good for at least five square
meals anyhow between now and mon-
day morning he told himself

  the food might have been execrable
or it might have been ambrosia for all
he knew however since he barely tasted
it with a reckless air johnson tossed
his last dime to the waiter and left the
dining-room

  once in his own apartment again he
laughed to himself over the ridiculous
predicament

  to work off his irritation he paced
restlessly back and forth as he did so
the main heads of a speech on the  ex-
pansion of the west which he was due
to deliver a week hence at the chicago
chamber of commerce dinner came into
his mind in imagination he saw before
him the sleek prosperous members of
that dignified body as the subject pos-
sessed him his voice grew louder and
louder

  say no s crazy exclaimed a
small bell-boy running excitedly up to
the desk  hes yellin and talkin to
himself up there to beat the band 

  a sudden light dawned upon the
clerk

   i thought that fellow was off his
bat he said turning to the manager

   well if he is suggested the latter
-a small excitable man- youd bet-
ter call up belford right away we
cant take any chances remember what
a time we had with that crazy dutch-
man last year-claimed he was an at-
tache of the german embassy and
turned out to be an anarchist on his way
to washington to kill the president
a millionaires dilemma



  the clerk picked up the telephone

   belford hospital he said quickly
 dr belknap of the psychopathic
ward--in a hurry oh i say is that
you doctor this is the grantley
weve got a fellow here who imagines
hes a california millionaire hut its
my private belief he hasnt a cent

  the voice at the other end answered
calmly we cant do anything unless
he grows violent-youve got to be care-
ful in such cases if you have any
trouble with him however call upon
us

   you keep watch of  jimmy
cautioned the clerk returning to his
desk  if he goes off his head run
right down here

  the small bell-boy had been all ears
during this conversation and his face
betokened intense interest with an ap-
preciative grin he was off like a shot

  the telephone girl stepped up to the
desk

   no s just tried to have me get
senator bradley of california at his
washington home she said excitedly
 and they told me he was at the white
house no  says to get him any-
how even if i have to call the president
in order to do it do you spose hes
another  she added in an undertone

  the manager walked back to the
booth with her  instead of the white
house hell get vie on the wire he an-
nounced decidedly

   yes sir as an excited voice sound-
ed from the upper regions  ill get the
white house right away-and when i
do ill call you

  meantime johnsons restlessness had
increased to fever heat a half-hour
elapsed and he was not yet connected
with senator bradley he rang fran-
tically for bell-boys-no response

   never mind that washington call
he said finally taking up receiver
 ill try again in the morning

  sunday morning early the occupant
of room  began to ring word had
however gone forth among the bell-
boys that he was crazy and they feared
to answer the call-especially since the
dining-room had reported him as a
 ten-center and there was consequent-
ly no glittering bait to stimulate their
courage but overpowered by curi-

osity they had crept up noiselessly from
time to time lo reconnoiter it was on
one of these occasions that johnson
flung the door open suddenly and found
jimmy crouched at the keyhole

  the californian had spent a sleepless
night and his temper was completely
beyond control jimmy screamed lustily
as johnson grabbed him

ii

  a half-hour later two gentlemen
who bad just been telephoning were as-
tonished to behold a frantic wild-eyed
disheveled person dragged through the
corridor loudly protesting his collar
was torn blood streamed from a cut in
his forehead and two- belford attend-
ants who had him in charge seemed to
meet with no check from the manage-
ment

  whats all this about asked one
of the onlookers turning to the tele-
phone girl

   oh just a lunatic who imagines hes
a millionaire from california hes
been calling up the biggest men in new
york-tried to get a big check cashed
last night but they were on to him right
away so the minute he got violent they
phoned the insane ward at belford
theyre taking him off now ad the
girl shrugged her shoulders indifferently

  the gentleman addressed suddenly
caught sight of the victims face

   by all thats holy if that isnt sam
johnson he exclaimed

   whats left of him duncan john-
son called out faintly

  mr duncan turned angrily to the
manager

   what in the name of common sense
do you mean   he demanded  why
this gentleman is known from one end
of the west to the other if hes out of
funds he can draw on me for any sum
he wants

   and on me too echoed his com-
panion

  the doctors from belford beat a
hasty retreat as they grasped the situa-
tion the manager and clerk stood
aghast too thoroughly overcome to at-
tempt a defense

   mr johnson said the former
finally pulling himself together  the


the argosy

house is at your disposal only tell us
what we can do to square things-
before johnson could answer the
loud choo choo of an automobile
sounded at the door and a pompous in-
dividual fur-coated and capped fairly
burst through the revolving-door

   how fortunate i am to get here in
time the newcomer exclaimed rushing
up to the californian and extending his
hand  i hurried on here at once when
the auditorium told me you had just
left but what on earth-

  his eye suddenly lighted  johnsons
disreputable appearance

  the clerk and manager exchanged
significant glances clearly their case

was hopeless noicf for when this gen-
tleman who always selected the grant-
ley for his private  deals and had
left a golden train of gratuities in his
wake - when he once learned how his
friend had been maltreated they would
see him no more at that hostelry nor his
benefactions

  sam johnson may have caught the
appeal in their eyes or it may have been
his irrepressible sense of humor-for he
laughingly replied oh nothing mr
piermortt ive just been seeing new
york thats all i thought we moved
some out our way but i must confess
for speed and excitement we arent in
it with gotham

something for nothing

                by robert carlton brown

                   the confessions of a bluffer in connection with an epi-
                   sode in which he himself was perfectly on the level

if anybody had come along at that
moment and offered me twenty real
dollars for my chances of heaven and
ive always considered them pretty good
id have taken the money without a mo-
ments hesitation

  you dont hesitate when youre bust-
ed you know theres  use if op-
portunity had knocked on my door
shed have never got away with it id
have opened up so quick and pulled her
in and put her in the refrigerator for
safe keeping that thered never have
been a chance for her to get out and do
any more knocking

  but nothing turned up id hocked
everything i had except my socks and
 only had a clean pair of them left
id called  every friend i knew and
used every persuasive argument i could
think of but all to no avail

  here i was fifteen cents in loose
change in my pocket and three well-
worn dollars in my wallet

  there wasnt any use of praying id
got past that so i sat there in my
elegant suite consisting of a hall bed-
room and absently fingered over the
three dollars

  i puiled out a pack of cards to pass

the time and fell to pretending that i
was a gambler not that i have ever
been anything else although a mighty
poor one well id take a card off
the top and put my fifteen cents on it to
hold it down then id look in the
glass at my face beautifully bedecked
with whiskers and meander on this
wise

   bill ill bet you its a red card

  whatll you bet id answer my-
self

   three dollars was my quick come-
back and then id flash the anemic roll
and jay it on top of the card

  after that id turn the card up and
find that it was black

  you see luck was against me 
couldnt win even mind-money and as
for paying those friendly little bets id
just chalk them up on the bureau and
offer to double that the next one would
be a heart

  sure enough when i turned the card
it would be a spade you couldnt beat
it i could have gambled on my luck
without fear but theres no use gam-
bling that way

  and the worst of it all was i was in
wrong on the love-game too when
something for nothing



you get in wrong that way there are
only two things left to do go out and
drown your sorrow or yourself

  you see this girl wasnt any common
article she wras ace high but she made
me feel like a deuce-spot when i looked
at her

  id been telling her right along wed
get hitched up and shed been calling
on me to produce the goods in the shape
of an engagement-ring well what
could i do

  it was a cinch i couldnt tell her how
busted i wtas for theres nothing will
kill love quicker and i couldnt give
any plausible excuse about the ring ex-
cept that i hadnt found a stone good
enough for her

  after that gag wore out i told her
id got the ring and i was having it
engraved the jeweler had been work-
ing on it about a week now and i was
beginning to think hed never get
through so was she

  well i kept on playing cards until
i stood about three hundred out against
myself and then i was struck with a
brilliant idea

  no i wasnt going out to make a
name for myself and win her i hadnt
any game to work or anything of that
sort the idea was quite common and
sordid and not at all in the class with
most of them

  it was only that i remembered a
friend an old  bar-keep who was the
only one on my calling-list that i hadnt
touched

  of course i couldnt slight him so
i jumped up having just lost another
hundred to myself and leaving the
cards as they lay i took down my two-
dollar panama and made a noise like go-
ing away

  the noise was very effective my
landlady rushed out with an open hand
i knew she couldnt hurt me much with-
out doubling it up so i walked right
past her and didnt bat an eye

  when i struck the street i was unde-
cided it might be well to end it all by
falling through a handy man - hole
for a minute i wished that some pass-
ing air-ship would drop a bag of ballast
and obliterate me but then courage
came and i decided to take my fate in
my own hands

  understand me right i didnt intend
to commit suicide or matrimony i
wasnt that desperate i just thought
that a nice little lonesome walk down
on the dock would fall in well with my
present mood so i lit out for the bat-
tery

   went down on one of the steamer
piers and stood around- in the way half
hoping that somebody would come along
and push me off but nobody did and
so i kept on walking around

  all of a sudden i looked down

  then i looked up

  after that i looked around pretend-
ing that i was searching for the lusi-
tania or some other mere speck  the
horizon but in reality i was trying to
see if anybody was watching me

  nobody was so with one quick
lunge i shot out my arm and picked
it up

  then i held it up to the light and
admired it

  the stone was as pretty a one-carat
diamond as i ever saw in my life

  the gem was set in a ring i slipped
the thing on my little finger and flashed
it in the sun my chest got in between
the sun and the ring and i could hardly
see it for being so puffed up

  well i didnt waste much more time
on that pier i didnt like the scenery-
anyway what was the use of looking
for the owner i argued of course
the person who had lost it had sailed to
africa that morning and foreign ad-
vertising would be so expensive

  yes i decided to keep it and not say
a word to the coroner or any other of
the city officials

  i jumped on a car and felt languidly
in my pocket for some loose change as
though it werent worth the mentioning
i found it all right fifteen cents was
all i looked at it with surprise just as
though i thought i had any more ex-
cept the three ones which immediately
became small change in my eyes dazzled
as they were by the diamond

  its the surest thing you know that i
got off at mabels street some way or
other i couldnt think of anything else

  didnt i have the engagement - ring
now and couldnt we hock it and get
married my luck had changed

  mabel came to the door i went in


the argosy

  when we sat down i flashed it on her

  oh bill she said

  i took the bouquet and bowed for the
applause it was all very nice i
couldnt have expected anything better
if id paid twice the price for the en-
gagement-ring

   but bill she broke out suddenly
slipping the ring over her thumb  it
doesnt fit 

   confound that jeweler anyway 
i exclaimed grabbing the ring away
from her  what rights he got in-
sulting my bride-to-be by making the
thing so large still he probably made
the ring after the regular pattern and
didnt figure on your fingers being so
much smaller than the rest of them

  she fell for it-women always do-
and she handed me a sweet smile when
i told her id have it fixed up for her
right away

   slipped the ring  my little finger
and we both sat there admiring it like
two children looking at an all - day
sucker

  well finally her happiness began run-
ning away with her and she suggested
something about going out and getting
a little lunch to celebrate the occasion
i hung back for a minute she gave me
a queer look and suggested that the ring
must have busted me

   not on your life i came back at
her  a little thing like that why
girl i was thinking of buying you a
pair of those stones but i couldnt find
another as good as this one to match
put on your duds and well go right
out

   but im not eating much myself to-
day i added as i remembered the fact
that three little bones was all that there
was between me and being dead broke

  i was just chuckling to myself about
the whole thing and dreaming oyer
what i was going to do to the bookies
next day after i hocked that sparkler
when she came back all dressed up like
she was going to the races

  well i managed to side-step a few
of the swellest joints on the great
white way and finally hauled up at a
pretty good place where i figured she
could fill her face for about two-fifty
and i counted on myself for one little
highball just for company although i

had breakfasted that morning on three
cigarettes and the last drop in my flask

  she didnt order very strong and i
was feeling mighty happy

  joe de free came in and i called
him over he caught sight of the ring
and tried hard not to notice it i saw
him turn green however he used to
be in love with mabel

  well he didnt say much he never
liked me anyway but he looked holes
in that ring and then smiled and took
the table farthest away from us i knew
it made the right sort of a killing be-
cause j oe knew diamonds and he stuck
up his nose at this one which clearly
showed that it was a pretty good
sparkler

  i was tickled at the way he took my
sudden rise in the world and so was
mabel she never liked him anyway
after the first time she saw me

  you see she knew hed be watching
us and she wanted to show him she had
a man with a roll so she changed her
mind called back the waiter and lit
into that menu as though she was com-
ing down the home-stretch

  the pace was a little too fast for me
it went over my pile the third time she
opened her mouth but i figured i
could call the head waiter aside and tell
him to hold off the balance until i could
send my check over ive done that be-
fore

  having the three in my pocket to
show that i was right gave me confi-
dence and  knew i could get out of it
some way by paying that part in cash
it showed i had the right spirit any-
way

  the only thing that worried me was
that joe would see me do it and i
couldnt stand for that but i figured
i could excuse myself and see the head
waiter before the bill came and have it
fixed without joe de free getting wise

  of course i couldnt say anything to
the girl  peeked around the edge of
the table to see if she had her hand-bag
with her but  nothing doing-she
was out to lunch on my invitation

  well i sat there and quailed in
spirit while she ate it on toast i didnt
get blue around the gills in fact i
never have since i learned to bluff at
poker
something for nothing



  the game got kind of interesting and
i watched her eat as though i enjoyed
it she urged me to take something
and joe was looking so i took a little
lobster salad just to keep her company

  it was all i could do to keep from
picking up the dish and letting it all
down my mouth at once i was that
hungry

  well you know all good things come
to an end and mine came with a sudden
shock

  the waiter tiptoed around to my side
and whispered in my ear

   its saturday afternoon and i wait
out in fort george in a hotel over sun-
day  would you please pay your bill
now so i can get away

  well there was nothing to do but
pay and very little to pay with

  with my -best thousand-dollar air i
reached into my pocket and said
 certainly gargon

  of course he thought i vvas the real
goods i even deceived myself for a
minute

  but only a minute

  i felt again

  my wallet was not there

  then i searched in my other pockets
nothing doing meanwhile the waiter
was waiting which being his business
didnt worry me much but  caught
sight of joe looking at me out of the
tail of his eye and mabel was toying
with her fork and looking kind of
fussed

  then i remembered suddenly that i
had left the three bills at home on the
cards when the sudden inspiration came
to go out and look up that old bar-
keep friend

  i told the waiter about it and he
smiled as though he had heard the story
before maybe he had for its one of
my best

  i didnt know what to do so i didnt
do anything

  then it occurred to me to call the
head waiter

  he came and looked me over it
was a careful scrutiny i felt as though
i were taking a civil-service examina-
tion in bluffing and was about to have
my examination-paper marked sixteen
on the basis of one hundred points

  i told him my story too id have

told it to the priest ihe only weak
point in it was that i knew what the
wallet contained and they didnt

   ive had too much of this around
here he told me at length looking
me over carefully  i dont cater to
the trade of the sporting fraternity
anyway and i think the best thing you
can do is to wait peacefully until i call
up the patrol

  i thought wildly of joe then i de-
cided in a hurry that id rather go to
the station than borrow money of him
suddenly i caught sight of my ring

  i had forgotten all about that 
pulling the diamond off i assumed
my most haughty manner and remarked
 possibly you will be willing to keep
this as a deposit until i return with the
cash for this trifling lunch  

  it killed him i could hear his last
breath as he passed away

  taking the ring he started a series
of bowings and pardonings i began
to think i was king of the south sea
islands and that i was hiring him just
to do that

  i got so forgiving and generous all
of a sudden that i had a mind to- give
the waiter half my kingdom as a tip

  but just then the throne fell

  possibly you never heard a throne
fall i never did before they make
an uproarious crash

  you see this was how it was 

  joe de pree had heard part of the
argument and noticed me offering the
diamond as security i had seen him
making for the table on a gallop but i
figured he only wanted to lend me
money

  what was my surprise when he butted
in and grabbed the ring at the same time
yelling

   its a phony diamond it aint
worth fifteen cents they make em
over in connecticut and sell em by the
barrel they buy em down on the bow-
ery by the bushel and you can get em
anywhere by the peck

  that finished me i waited patiently
for somebody to come along and carry
out the remains on a stretcher i knew
it would be me who else could it be

  my head hit what used to be my
chest and i gave one groan as i looked
at mabel


the argos y

  joe was standing beside her with that
blooming leer of his and of course she
thought i did it all on purpose it
hurt her pretty hard i guess and i
hated to see joe standin so close to her
but what could i do

  the head waiter cremated what was
left of me with a fiery stare and started
in the direction of the telephone which
i knew to be an instrument used on oc-
casions to call the police

  just as he left the tableau around the
table in which  was playing villain
and joe hero an old fellow i had no-
ticed at the table next to us bounced up
and butted in

  wait a minute he hollered grab-
bing the head waiter by the sleeves and
pulling him back

   let me see that diamond  he went
on

  the head waiter handed it over
dumbly and i saw the old mans eyes
light up

  i didnt hope what was the use
he was probably a detective anyway
oh but i was in wrong

   you gentlemen are mistaken that
is a diamond but it is full of flaws and
yellow he continued after a careful
scrutiny of the stone

  joes jaw fell he hadnt had a good
look at the thing anyway

  the head waiter looked at the vener-
able gentleman and began to back water

   ill give you thirty dollars for it
right now the old gentleman offered
at length

   it belongs to him said the waiter
drawing toward me

  will you take thirty for it the
old gentleman asked kindly stepping
over to me

   will i-will i-will i take-say
that again please i stammered

   ive offered you thirty he repeat-
ed  will you take it

  for some minutes i tried to get the
nerve to reply then i held my hand
out limply and answered  lay it
there

  pulling out the healthiest pocketbook
i have seen in years the old gentleman
peeled a hundred-dollar bill from the
outside and handed it to the waiter

   get that changed he ordered

  joe disappeared

  the head waiter lifted me back to my
rightful throne as king of the south sea
islands and i dismissed him with a
wave of my hand when i began to feel
that his salaaming act was getting pretty
poor

  the waiter rushed back his hand
trembling with its load of bills

  skinning off fives to the number of
six the elderly gentleman handed me
the thirty with a smile and slipped the
ring in his pocket

  i paid my bill and cut for the door
mabel hanging weakly to my arm

  just as i got out i saw the old man
coming through the door

  i turned to thank him as he got into
a taxicab

  dont -thank me he said even
if it was a poor diamond i wanted-it

  but for when and for why i
murmured weakly you dont mean
that it isnt a diamond after all  

   its the rottenest fake i ever saw
he told me  and you played a pretty
poor game yourself

  me played a game i cried
trying hard to understand

   sure you knew it was a phony
diamond all the time he smiled

   i did not but if its a fake why-
why on earth did you pay me thirty for
it then i cried

   bo and he pulled my ear closer
 bo that hundred-dollar bill i changed
was a phony too ive been trying to
get rid of it all day i saw the chance
there and took it im much obliged to
you

  giving the driver an order he spun
off

  i stood dazed on the curb staring
after him until mabel grabbed me and
led me off as meek as a lamb

   have you got the price of a mar-
riage license she asked

  i pulled out the remainder of the
thirty and answered why

   because she replied were go-
ing to get one you need somebody to
look after you

  i was convinced that she was right
and as i had the price and felt a change
in my luck i called up a taxi and we
started off

  just as we were turning the corner
mabel looked back
at the end of his rope	

  suddenly she grabbed my arm

   whats that man dancing up and
down on the sidewalk for was her
question

  i took a look

  the man she was talking about was
the proprietor of the restaurant and he
was jumping around wildly in front of
his place

   that doesnt seem to be a look of
joy on his face does it i smiled

  but whats the matter with him

   stung i guessr-

  it wasnt until later that i really real-
ized who had got the worst of the deaj
that made me a happy man for life and
put the crook just seventy dollars ahead
then i realized why the restaurant-
keeper was dancing around

  about a week after that my wife and
i hit a bunch of luck and consequently
fed our faces at the waldorf

  just as we were being seated i saw a
little group around a near-by corner

  to my boundless surprise i made out
the face of the man who had given me
thirty for the phony diamond and thus

stuck the restaurant-keeper for a hun-
dred

  my blood boiled he had accused
me of trying to work a game when i
was absolutely on the square the fel-
low he had stung ought to get his
money back

  i stepped over to the table after whis-
pering to my wife to wait a moment and
watch what happened

  when i confronted him he turned
deathly pale  felt sorry for him for
a second-but no longer

  then  found that he had just be-
friended somebody or other as he had
me and had sent a fifty out to be
changed

  i hurried after the waiter and asked
to see the bill

  sure enough it was a phony

  then i bawled him out

  well i paid back to the restaurant-
keeper the thirty that had put me on my
feet so that left only seventy for the
counterfeiter to return and when he
got our two rolls together you never saw
such a happy hash-house proprietor in
your life

at the end of his rope

                    by fred v greene jr

    three thousand miles from home hope gone and the realization that you are being
    hounded by a man who has done you a service and is eager to make a touch

h good morning walker 
myers wheeled around in his
chair and faced the young playwright
who stood at a respectful distance from
the theatrical managers desk

   im glad you came in he contin-
ued  because i wanted to see you re-
garding this play of yours just draw
that chair up here

  walker did so and a nervous ex-
pectancy came over him was his work
really going to be accepted

   ive read your play myers con-
tinued  that is ive read it over
hurriedly and im frank in saying i
like it of course there are some little
defects-or at least they appear defects
to me-but they are so unimportant that
we could easily smooth them out on

the whole i think it is very good-very
good indeed

  walkers breath was coming in short
quick gasps now perhaps he need
not remember that he had only money
enough to last until a set day and that
day rapidly approaching

   then you-take it  he said slowly
 well no not exactly myers
could not fail to notice walkers coun-
tenance as it slowly paled to the color
of chalk  neither do i say i will not
take it the manager hastened to add
 i want a little more time to give it a
second reading

  more time the younger man re-
peated bitterly  thats what you all
say and then in the end it comes back
to me


the argosy

   well of course i dont know what
the others have said the manager went
on  but as for me i am serious and
mean business to-day is monday give
me until wednesday to decide and i
assure you i will give you a positive
answer then it will be yes or no

   very well sir walker assented in
tones of disappointment he seemed
completely discouraged  i shall come
back on wednesday

   yes in the afternoon myers added
- about three oclock is that agree-
able to you

    it is

  the rising of the manager to his feet
told walker more plainly than words
that the interview was at an end and
accepting the extended hand he walked
slowly toward the door where he sud- t
denly faced about	t

   uo you think - do you think -
youll use it he queried falteringly

 come back wednesday - three
oclock was the managers noncom-
mittal reply and the playwright hastily
left the office

  upon reaching the sidewalk walker
stood for some moments lost in thought
he did not heed the passing throng at
last he brought out his express company
book and counted carefully the remain-
ing checks

  just enough to last me the week
out he mused as he replaced the book
in his pocket if myers does not take
the play-well its the annapolis for me
on saturday in the meantime to eat
and sleep i must count every penny be-
fore i spend it well ive got to have
some more money so i might as well get
it now

  he turned and walked slowly across
the square headed in the direction of
the express companys offices

  stanley walker was distinctly ameri-
can tall broad-shouldered and with
an air of self-confidence that marks the
self-made man he was liked and re-
spected by all with whom he came in
contact

  as society reporter for one of the
leading newspapers of new york he
had come in touch in a small way with
the stage and its celebrities not as
closely as might be thought perhaps
but enough to instil into his heart the

ambition to write a successful play
the germ of this desire was not left
very long in its original state but grew
rapidly as walker built upon a plot that
had struck his fancy and as the play
neared completion he began to dream
of fame and riches

  contrary to the usual experiences of
young dramatists walker was successful
in interesting a manager even before the
play was finished and a few months later
he saw the beginning of his dream real-
ized-the city was billed from one end
to the other with posters announcing the
new play

  then fate dealt him a cruel blojv
the play while not being ranked with
the seasons failures wtas certainly not a
success and after a two-wteeks run was
consigned to that graveyard which has
proved a resting-place for the hopes and
ambitions of so many playwrights

  but wtalker was not discouraged in-
stead he saw defects in the play he did
not realize existed at the rehearsals

  with this as a stimulus to further
effort he resigned his position-he had
about a thousand dollars saved up-and
threw himself heart and soul into the
work a new play demanded in due
time it was completed to his satisfaction
and he set out upon the task of finding
a manager

  here he met his waterloo the man-
ager who had put on his first play would
not even read the new one--he had lost
heavily on the other-and walker trav-
eled from one theatrical office to the
next but the same reply met him on all
sides-they were supplied with plays for
at least two seasons

  at length in absolute disgust with
american theaters he decided to invade
a new field and immediately began
preparations for a trip to london he
gathered together all his available assets
converted them into express-orders rep-
resenting about three hundred dollars
and sailed for england

  immediately upon his arrival he
started on his rounds of the theatrical
offices but no manager greeted him
with outstretched hand-the right reach-
ing eagerly for the manuscript and the
left tendering a good-sized check for
advance royalties

  failure stared the dramatist in the
at the end of his rope	l

face and although he fought against it
he began to realize his hopes were ebb-
ing rapidly but faster still his funds
were dwindling away

 then came a sudden turn that
brought him from the depths of despair
to the heights of hope

  he ventured one day timorously into
mr augustus myerss office again after
repeated efforts to see him the man-
ager had now returned to the city he
learned breathlessly he awaited the
answer of the boy who had taken his
card to the inner office

  he could hardly believe it true when
that watch-dog came back and pompous-
ly pushed him into the sanctum sancto-
rum

  the interview was very brief-mr
myers said he would be glad to read
the play if walker would leave it for
a few days and after arranging for an
interview for the following monday the
young dramatist took his departure

  monday came at last and he again
presented himself at myerss office his
heart beat rapidly as he listened to the
managers words and although there
was nothing definite arranged he felt
now that the future did hold something
in store for him

  but when he reached the sidewalk
and carefully counted the express checks
he ascertained that for the present at
least it was not ready cash he had
just enough funds to last until saturday
and leave sufficient to pay his passage
home and then it would have to be one
of the slower steamship lines

  when he reached the express com-
panys offices he took out the checks he
wished converted into english cur-
rency leaving in the book just enough
to pay his passage

   in gold please he said as he
passed them through the window

  the clerk took the checks examined
the signatures carefully then proceeded
to count out the requested amount in
sovereigns and some silver

  the money was pushed out to him
just as walker realized that another
man had entered and stood behind him
awaiting his turn at the window a
quick glance disclosed a tall person hi
a gray suit

  the playwright pulled the pile of
     a

coin toward him and moving aside a
trifle proceeded to count it

  at that instant he heard the stranger
query has that remittance arrived
yet  

  walker was on the point of glancing
up at the man whose voice he had in-
stantly recognized as distinctly ameri-
can then a thought struck him

  here was a fellow countryman in a
strange land evidently in need of funds
who might recognize him as from the
united states and seeing him counting
what looked like a large amount of
money request a temporary loan if
he did what could he say and how
could-

  no not yet sir the voice of the
cashier broke in upon walkers thoughts

   good heavens man ive got to
live and i cant return to new york
without funds are you positive my
cable was sent

  yes sir positive the cashier as- 
sured him

   well im in a pretty hole i must
say if  only knew some one here in
london-

  at that instant walker dropped the
gold coins into his pocket and they
clicked together noisily then he real-
ized the stranger had stopped abruptly
in his speech and a peculiar intuition
told him the american was staring at
his back

   what could i say or do if he should
ask me to loan him some money
flashed through walkers mind  
couldnt do it and he wouldnt believe
me and-

  he felt a hand upon his arm and
knew his fears had been realized on
tbe impulse of the moment lie slipped
from under the weight of the strangers
hand and without a glance toward him
dashed from the office at full speed and
springing into a waiting hansom ordered
the driver to make all possible haste to
his hotel

 ii

  the cab tore up the traffic-thronged
street at a reckless pace walker not
daring even to look behind fearing he
might be followed a strange feeling
had come over him at thought of the
dire plight of his fellow countryman


the argosy

   why his case is even worse than
mine the dramatist reflected settling
back in the cushions  i can get back
to new york while he-well heaven
only knows what hell do

  then he added quickly  pshaw
hell get his remittance any moment
and then hell undoubtedly be a great
deal better off than i am from the side
glance i caught he looked pretty pros-
perous anyway

  certain now that he was not followed
he interested himself in the crowds
through which he was being driven and
the incident was forgotten but some
moments later it returned forcibly

   good heavens he exclaimed
aloud  the last time i was at the ex-
press office i left my address there with
orders to forward to my hotel any mail
that might arrive suppose the stranger
should ask the cashier who  was and
if he knew where i was stopping and
he should tell him my runningaway
as i did would only make matters look
worse and he would not believe me
when i showed him how much i have
left in my check-book

  instinctively his hand sought the
pocket in which he had placed it it
was not there

  thinking he might have absently re-
moved it to a different pocket he rapid-
ly felt from one to the other but his
eager fingers did not close upon the
book and in utter dismay he realized it
was gone

  he sprang to his feet and searched the
cab but without success

   i may have dropped it in the express
companys office he muttered if i
did i am safe because the checks are
not negotiable by any one but me ill
order the driver to return anyway
signaling the man he directed him to
go back to their starting-place

   what a fool thing to do he mut-
tered  unless i find it im as badly
off-no im worse off-than that stran-
ger because he undoubtedly has some
one to cable to for money while i have
nobody

  as they neared the express office the
thought occurred to him that there wras
a possibility the american might not
have left there but be waiting around
hoping for the rply to his cable

    well i dont care if he is walker
declared  ill face him this time with-
out compunction its really his fault
if i dropped the check-book because in
my haste to get away i may not have
put it in my pocket securely

  nevertheless he had a strong fear of
meeting the man a dread that increased
to such an extent that as he neared the
office he kept a careful lookout for a
tall fellow in a gray suit and it was
with a feeling of relief that he sprang
to the sidewalk when the cab drew up
to the curb because a quick survey of
the interior of the office assured him the
dreaded person had left

  walker hurried to the cashiers win-
dow

   i have lost my check-book he in-
formed that individual  and wish to
prevent payment of the checks

  the cashier looked him over carefully
for a moment then queried  your
name sir

   walker-stanley walker the dra-
matist answered impatiently  you
know me-i was here only a few mo-
ments ago

   yes sir i do was the response
 but it is a form i am forced to follow
how much was there in the book

   eight ten-dollar checks and one
five-dollar one i evidently dropped it
right after i left here then he added
in an appealing tone  please try to
find it i must have that amount to
get me back to new york

  the cashiers face did not relax a
particle as he slowly opened a drawer
of his desk

   i have it here mr walker the
man who was behind you saw you drop
it as you ran out and handed it to me
w alker reached for the extended
check-book but his eyes were riveted
upon the cashiers face

   that man-that american-the one
in the gray suit-found it he stam-
mered

   yes sir

  what shall i do the playwright
queried blankly  should i reward
him he needs money-i heard his
conversation with you

  walker now felt his position to be
more complex than ever surely this
friendless stranger was entitled to some-
at the end

of his rope



thing yet how could he afford to re-
ward him

  perhaps by stinting himself he could
spare him a pound but this amount
might be considered an insult before
these thoughts thaf raced through his
brain had resolved themselves into any
definite decision the cashier said

   i think he is going to hunt you up
sir he opened the book and looked at
the checks before he handed them to
me and then asked if i knew what hotel
mr walker was stopping at

  and you told him walker que-
ried aghast at the new turn of events

  yes sir fortunately i had your
address and gave it to him

  walker heaved a sigh of -despair so
deep and sad that the cashier was
alarmed

   i hope i did right in giving it to
him he ventured

  yes - no - oh it didnt matter
then he turned abruptly and started to-
ward his cab the charges for which he
knew were accumulating rapidly

  again he directed the driver to his
hotel and then leaned his chin dejected-
ly on his hands

   what next he mused as if i
hadnt  troubles enough already if
there were a cheap steamer leaving to-
day darned if i wouldnt take it and
save the cost of my board and lodging
till saturday i can get a job on a
new york newspaper easily enough
then suddenly

  no im hanged if i will ill stay
till saturday and see the game to the
finish but if i do that ive got to
keep dodging that gray - suited fellow
because now i owe him a reward i sup-
pose and i know he would not accept
it but he wafits a loan  he thinks i
could not refuse him after what hes
done but as luck-my brand of luck-
would have it ive got to do so and
now he has my hotel address-that
proves my theory as to what he wants-
he paused then added almost plain-
tively   i dont know why i am cursed
with such confounded ill luck

  he was now within a block of his
hotel and at this instant he saw cross-
ing the street just ahead of him the
tall gray-suited american

  instinctively walker pressed as far

back as possible into the cushions but
the stranger did not look in the direc-
tion of the cab and a sigh of relief
broke from its occupant

   i suppose hes been to the hotel to
interview me walker muttered  and
tell me how much  am indebted to
him and that a small temporary loan
would be greatly appreciated

  he glanced around as he stepped
from the cab then hurriedly paid the
driver and dismissed him he walked
rapidly into the hotel lobby and as he
passed the desk the clerk called to him
 there was a gentleman here to see you
only a few moments ago mr walker
 i know it the dramatist snapped
 oh you saw him then

  no i did not walker realized
that he had said more than he intended
and added in a more genial tone  but
i felt sure some one would call this
morning

   the gentleman seemed quite disap-
pointed not to find you in the clerk
continued  he asked me if i knew
when you would return and as you had
given me no direction i had to tell him
i did not he said he would come back
this afternoon

  oh is that so walkers tone
was careless in the extreme

   yes and he left his card and-

   let me see who this persistent per-
son is the other interrupted reaching
out his hand for the bit of pasteboard

  the clerk fumbled among some papers
on his desk then searched under it care-
fully but his quest proved fruitless and
he avoided walkers inquiring looks as
he said nervously i had it only a
minute ago but i cant find it now it
seems to have disappeared but ill come
across it and send it up to you

   dont trouble yourself it is of
small importance

  there was a sarcastic tinge to walk-
ers tone that the clerk mistook as lieing
directed towards himself

   oh ill find it sir it must be
right here

   very wrell if you do send it up
to me i am going to my room and am
at home to no one then with more
determination in his tone that usual he
repeated  understand me-i am at
home to no one	


the argosy

  he turned from the desk and as he
crossed the lobby caught a glimpse of
a person entering the hotel it was just
a fleeting glance but it was enough
he recognized the gray-suited american

  hardly conscious of what he was do-
ing he sprang behind a convenient
screen without being seen by his caller
and awaited the interview between him
and the clerk being close enough easily
to overhear their conversation

  is mr walker in he heard the
stranger inquire

   i do not think he is the clerk re-
plied evasively

   well find out the stranger com-
manded

   yes sir of course page go up
to mr walkers room one hundred and
fourteen and see if he is in

  it seemed an age to the screen-shel-
tered dramatist before there was further
conversation at the desk and then it
was the announcement by the bell-boy
 mr walker is not in

  he could almost see the clerk turn to
the stranger as he heard him inquire
suavely  is there any word you wish
to leave sir

   no there seemed a thoughtfulness
in his tone as he added  but i could
have sworn i saw him get out of a cab
here about five minutes ago i was
standing on the next corner-oh well
as soon as he returns tell him i called
you have my card

   yes sir-yes sir the clerk hastened
to reply

   very good

  the sound of retreating footsteps told
walker the man was moving toward the
door and after a brief wait he emerged
from his hiding-place

   thats the man sir the clerk said
as the guest approached him

   so i judged he returned  i didnt
see him and i dont want to let me
look at your london guide

  the clerk hastened to produce ithe
book and for some moments walker
pored over its pages then without
looking up he directed  make up
my bill immediately and have a cab at
the door in five minutes im going to
leave

  why so soon the clerk broke out
in amazement   hope sir it isnt be-

cause i lost the card because ill find
it-

   nothing to do with it the play-
wright interrupted tersely  ill be
down in five minutes

  he stalked away from the desk and
upon reaching his room hastily packed
his trunk and rang for the porter after
which he descended to the office again

   were sorry to have you go mr
walker the clerk said with real regret
 very sorry will you leave an address
for us to forward any mail that may
come 

   there will be none was the blunt
reply  hence  do not need to leave
my address but in case there should be
any letters hold them for me ill com-
municate with you in a day or two

  walker quickly paid his bill then
hurried to the waiting cab

   a pretty state of affairs he grum-
bled as the vehicle rumbled off toward
the address given to the driver  forced
to move because an insistent american
is determined that i shall lend him
money confound him and his nerve 
he added vindictively

iii

   fairly decent hotel walker com-
mented as he unpacked the articles
necessary for the brief stay at his new
abode  although i cant say that i
should care to stop here any longer than
saturday but it will do  until then
the one great thing in its favor is that
it is some cheaper than my last hotel

  heavens what an existence he
added as he flung himself dejectedly into
a chair  its enough to drive a person
crazy this waiting for one manager
after another either to - accept or turn
down a play

  he took his pipe from his pocket
and lighting it puffed away in thought-
ful silence he was building air-castles 
thinking of what would occur if myers
shouldaccept the play

  for some unknown reason he pinned
a heap of faith to this man he re-
called the old saying about the darkness
before the dawn and muttered   well
if im not in the deepest darkness just
at present i want to drop out of ex-
istence before it becomes any denser
at the end

of his rope



  for some time after the last few
flakes of tobacco in his pipe had burned
out walker sat in the depths of a brown
study at length he stretched his limbs
and roused himself

   i shouldnt be wasting my time this
way he murmured  i ought to be
planning a new play but i dont
think i could work out the simplest miss-
ing - jetter rebus just at present much
less concoct a plot but surely i cant
stay in this room all day to-day and to-
 morrow yet i suppose i must be-
cause as sure as i go out ill come face
to face with that persistent american
 oh well ive got to eat im going
to riskit

  he left the hotel and made his way
to a restaurant after a simple luncheon
lie strolled aimlessly around the city
taking care to avoid the strand and the
vicinity of the express station finally
he decided to run out to golders green
so headed for the nearest tube-station

  it was long after dark when he
reached his hotel again his afternoon
outing had given him an appetite and he
permitted himself the extravagance of
a hearty dinner after which he soon
went to bed

    confound it i cant stay indoors to-
day he told himself the next morning
 ive got to get some exercise i think
after breakfast ill take a stroll and
wind up at the hotel i left yesterday
its barely possible there may be some
mail there but i do wish it was to-
morrow so i could end this uncertainty
regarding myers

  he hunted up a small restaurant par-
took of a light breakfast then walked
slowly in the direction of the strand
as he turned into this famous street a
cab pulled up at the curb beside him
and a voice exclaimed why mr
walker of all people 

  the young dramatist faced about and
saw a smiling feminine face leaning
far out of a hansom

  for an instant lie could not realize
he was staring fixedly at miss hope
bailey an actress he had often come in
contact with during his newspaper ex-
periences his amazement quickly gave
way to a broad smile of pleasure at meet-
ing her again and he advanced eagerly
 well this is a surprise he said

   and just as much of a one for me
miss bailey returned laying her hand in
the one walker had extended  and
so this is where you are keeping your-
self is it

   yes keeping myself is a good way
to express it i assure you no one is re-
sponsible for me

   well why not jump in and take a
spin with me she suggested  i will
drop you any place you say

   and i accept the invitation very
gratefully walker returned taking the
vacant seat at the young ladys right
 why its just like being in new york
to see you again how are you getting
on as i remember it your new play
was to open a few days after i left for
london

   splendid   she announced gleefully
it was the one big success of the sea-
son  think of it-you have the honor
of sitting alongside a full-fledged star
dont you feel impressed

  i dont know walker laughed
 i cant see that the quick change from
a little star into a great big one has
altered you to any noticeable extent
then his face sobered and he added
thoughtfully  so the plav was a hit
eh

   indeed it was why at the satur-
day matinees they had to move the or-
chestra under the stage

   the play was written by burton
wasnt it

   yes and he is certainly very clever
but how about yourself your last play
was not very successful was it

  no not if the box-office receipts
be taken as a criterion walker laughed
bitterly  it ran only two weeks

   thats too bad miss bailey sym-
pathized  i heard about it  and-
why just think  havent seen you since
you were on the recorder you must
bridge that gap of time and tell me all
that has happened in the interim

   really there isnt anything to tell
the dramatist answered slowly  i
wrote the play that was a failure-so
much you know i wrote another he
paused a moment then added grimly
 i have it yet

  no one has accepted it

  no one walker repeated sullenly
 i came to london to market it i


the argos v

have been unsuccessful in my mission
and leave for new york on saturday
is it a womans play the actress
queried eagerly

  no it is written for a man and
as luck would have it all the managers
claim they want a play for a woman
star  have reached the conclusion that
men stars are things of the past

   i know an actress who is looking for
a good play she is to be at my new
york dinner - why there i never
thought of it are you engaged for
wednesday night

   until saturday my entire time is at
my disposal walker replied gloomily

   then you must join us miss bailey
went on enthusiastically  i am giving
a dinner that night to the new yorkers
i know who are in london just now
you will come 

   thank you ever so much and i
shall be delighted to do so the play-
wrights eyes glistened at the pleasant
prospect

   here is my card we will count on
your presence by the way - do you re-
member carroll dempster who made
the big hit in  the crossroads   he
is in town and will be with us too i
know i can assure you a jolly time

   i dont doubt it and ill be mighty
glad to come there was a truly sin-
cere ring to walkers tone  just ahead
is my hotel and if youll drop me there
you may then continue your drive with-
out the gloomy companion you have had
for some moments

    if you care to drive on with me
ill guarantee to lift you out of the
depths you seem to be in

  but walker pleaded an engagement
in truth he felt embittered against the
world and himself

  it annoyed him to learn of the success
of others it only seemed to magnify
the enormity of his failure and while
the meeting with hope bailey had been
a joyous surprise the news of what
others were doing made him so discon-
solate that he well knew he should only
prove a bore if he acted on her sug-
gestion

  he shook her hand warmly as he
alighted in front of the hotel lie had
left the day previous and with the
words to-morrow night and let

nothing interfere ringing in his ears
he turned toward his former hostelry
and entered the lobby

  any mail for me he queried of
the clerk

   no sir no mail was the reply
 but-

  anybody called he went on

  yes sir a gentleman was here late
yesterday afternoon to see you

   i dont doubt that walker laughed
 i hope you explained that i had left
without giving any address

   yes sir i did he seemed quite
disappointed but left his card saying
that if we heard from you to tell you
that he wanted to see you as soon as
possible

   well of all the display of congealed
nerve and brass  the dramatist splut-
tered  let me see the card anyway
id like to know who this american is
 he isnt an american the clerk
explained  this is the card he lefty
walker took it carelessly allowing his
eyes to glance at it inquisitively then
an exclamation of surprise and joy burst
from his lips

   myers   he exclaimed facing the
clerk he queried eagerly he said
he wanted to see me immediately
yes sir he said it was very impor-
tant and seemed quite put out to think
you had left no address

  walker hesitated a moment then
turned upon his heel and hurried to the
street here he hailed a passing cab
and ordered the man to drive to the
managers office

   i cant believe he has accepted the
play he kept telling himself  it
seems too good to be true yet what
else should he be so anxious to see me
about it must be that 

  although the driver was urging his
horse to an unusual speed it seemed to
the now thoroughly aroused dramatist
as if he would never reach his destina-
tion but at length the cab drew up
before the building walker paid the
fare and hurried within

   i wish to see mr myers he an-
nounced to the office-boy  here is mv
card

   mr myers aint in sir the boy
replied without offering to accept the
card
at the end

of his rope



  yes he is walker insisted he
sent for me-in fact lie called upon
me yesterday and not finding me in
left word for me to come here as soon
as possible

   well i dont know nothing about
that the boy said slowly  but i do
know he aint in now he was here
yesterday but he left for paris last
night

  the dramatists face fell

  he has gone to paris you say
he repeated blankly

   yes and he told me himself that
he would noc be back jill thursday
morning if he wants to see you you
had better come around then

  without a word walker faced about
and shambled out of the office

   its no use  he fairly moaned

  then suddenly his eyes blazed fire
and he ground his teeth together

   its that americans fault of
course myers has decided to take the
play-thats certain but the suspense
of it would have been ended if i had
not changed my hotel and that man
forced me to it-curse him 

  then he calmed down as he again
found himself upon the street

   oh well it will be all right thurs-
day i am certain he told himself

iv

  the remainder of the day dragged
slowly by walker feeling too impatient
to busy himself with any work

  suddenly the thoughts of his engage-
ment for the next evening occurred to
him but he quickly decided he would
not avail himself of the good time miss
bailey had promised he knew every
one there would be successful people of
the day while he-well he had just
simply failed he felt he could not
endure the stories of their attainments-
these would only accentuate his own con-
dition

  when he had accepted the invitation
the day before this had not occurred to
him but now he saw the folly of at-
tending he knew he could not be him-
self  and his depressed spirits would
certainly be noticed it would certainly
be in strong contrast with the jovial
happy people around him

  yet walker could not nerve himself
to send his regrets he pondered over
the subject for some time and at length
reached a plan of action-he would call
miss bailey on the phone thursday and
plead a business engagement which came
up at the last moment and did not give
him an opportunity to write

  his dinner was scarcely touched and
he hurried to his room again where he
flung himself into an easy chair here
he sat far into the night smoking and
thinking

  the next morning he awoke to the
realization that his head throbbed and
ached he felt ill-sick mentally and
physically he endeavored to eat a
light breakfast but gave it up in disgust
-his stomach rebelled at the very sight
of food

  it was late in the afternoon when
wralker strolled out into the street
thinking the air might benefit him in-
stinctively his footsteps turned toward
the building in which were located the
myers offices and without heeding his
direction he kept on and was presently
standing before the place  myers may
have returned he told himself  ill
just drop in anyway and find out

  but the manager was still in paris

  he went over there to see some
play that was to go on last night the
boy informed him  mr myers heard
it was a good one so he went over to
see if he could get it he was going
to see the final dress-rehearsal

  walkers face blanched and he stag-
gered at this piece of news

  could it lie myers would take it in
preference to his own he felt com-
pletely crushed now

  he made his way slowly back to his
hotel he was glad now that he had
made no preparations to accept miss
baileys invitation-he surely could not
go now he retired early to his room
to be alone with his discouragement

  the next morning found him in the
same gloomy state of mind although
shining through it all there was a ray
of hope but it was so small that often
it was lost completely for moments at a
time then would appear only to be
quickly swallowed once more in the
darkness of despair through which he
was groping


the argosy

  he felt a growing repugnance for
london and began to plan for his ar-
rival in new york with these thoughts
uppermost in his mind he started for
myerss place again

  although he knew the theatrical man-
ager did not make a practise of reaching
his office before eleven oclock in the
morning walker presented himself there
about nine-thirty hoping that by some
chance myers might arrive before his
regular time but as the moments
passed slowly and the hands of the office
clock neared the hour of eleven the
playwrights nervousness increased until
it became a positive torture

  suddenly the unkept engagement of
the night before came before him it
had entirely slipped his memory during
the morning and he realized he had
committed a breach of etiquette that de-
manded an immediate explanation of
some description

  yet he feared to leave the managers
office feeling certain myers might come
in at any moment and he might not
stay and-

   in the midst of his thoughts walkers
eyes had wandered to the telephone in-
strument upon the wall and a resolution
came to him here was an opportunity
to phone without expense and still re-
main on the watch for his quarry

   would you object to my using
your telephone a moment   he inquired
pleasantly of the boy forcing a smile to
his face  i have forgotten to make a
call that is necessary and if i go out to
do so i may miss mr myers

  the lad did not deign to look up from
the paper in which he appeared so in-
terested

    all right he agreed

  walker stepped to the instrument
and after ascertaining the telephone
number of the hotel at which miss
bailey was stopping removed the re-
ceiver and asked for the connection

   a brief wait and a voice at the other
end informed him  this is the royal
-with whom do you wish to speak

    miss bailey the playwright replied
 is she in  

   i do not know but i will find out
for you came over the wire  who
shall i sav wishes to speak to her

   mr walker

    just a moment please

  walker knew he was not a good one
at inventing excuses and nervously
rested first upon one foot flien upon
the other while he waited for the voice
he had asked for

   anyway he reasoned to himself

 this is better than being face to face
she cannot see my countenance giving
the lie to my words

  just then a voice which he recognized
queried is this you mr walker

   it is and good morning miss
bailey was the stammered response

ii j

   now make it a good excuse while
you are about it the other interrupted
 really i am very angry why did
you not join us last night

  business prevented walker de-
clared so positively that he was himself
amazed at the truthful sound of the
statement  a manager sent for me
regarding my play and of course i
had to respond

   and it was accepted after all  
miss bailey inquired eagerly

  no-not yet walkers tone was
doleful in the extreme  but he is look-
ing quite favorably upon it these
things all take time you know

   well his looking favorably upon it
is something the voice remarked quiet-
ly  but really you should have com-
municated with me perhaps i am sel-
fish in even thinking this way because
i know business before pleasure every
time but carroll was so disappointed
you see i had told him you were to
be here and he said he wanted to see
you very much

  and who is carroll walker
queried

   why carroll dempster foolish
was the chiding reply he says he
knows you you ought to know him-
he made tbe big success in  the cross-
roads 

   i remember him the other re-
turned i knew him before he was
prominent

   he said he was quite anxious to see
you miss bailey went on  and asked
if i knew where you were stopping
fortunately i remembered where i had
dropped you the other day and told him
he smiled very strangely and said he
at the end

oe his rope



would call upon you do you know
why the name of your hotel should
cause him to smile

  i -  dont know walker stam-
mered

  he was on the point of correcting
her with regard to his stopping-place
but on second thought refrained from
doing so

   he probably only wants to tell me
of his success he mused

   but i wish you would dine with
us some evening before you go miss
bailey continued  i mean with mr
dempster and myself

   thank you i will try to arrange it
walker said as if he meant it  i will
communicate with you as soon as i can
arrange it there is not much time left
and i have a great deal to attend to
before i leave for new york again
i repeat my regrets regarding last eve-
ning

   well i accept your apology she
laughed  good-by for the present

  as walker turned from the telephone
he heard heavy steps in the hallway
and his eyes lighted up expectantly as
the manager entered the room

  oh hallo walker you here was
his greeting but the frown that gathered
upon his forehead did not escape the
dramatist

   yes sir he responded  i am
here because you sent for me

  so i did but i want to see what
mail there is for me just sit down a
few moments and then ill see you

  he nodded toward a vacant chair
and walker settled in it while the man-
ager hurried on toward his private office

  for some time the playwright was
kept waiting endeavoring to draw some
conclusion from mr myerss words or
looks but although he tried to reason
it out from all sides in the end he
found himself as much in the dark as
ever

  true the mans frown did not fore-
castsuccess yet his words were cheerful
then he had sent for him and if he did
not -want to see him he could have dis-
missed him with a few remarks

  but just as walker felt certain all
was well the frown would come before
him and banish the hopes he clung to
so tenaciously

  the bell in the private office suddenly
rang and the boy hastened to answer
the summons he quickly returned and
ushered the dramatist into the managers
presence

   sorry to have kept you waiting
walker myers began as he fumbled
idly among the papers that cluttered his
desk  but sit down a moment

  the playwright pulled up a chair
and leaned forward expectantly

   well walker your play is a good
one and i certainly think it will make
a hit when produced

  then you take it the other broke
in excitedly

   not so fast myers cautioned while
walkers face broke into a nervous smile
 after you left monday i settled down
to read it thoroughly the more i read
the more i liked it and my only wonder
is that some manager did not pounce
upon it long ago

  walkers spirits soared far above terra-
firma and he could hardly realize that
he wras not dreaming or that his ears
were not playing a cruel trick upon him

   so i decided it was just what i wan-
ted  and as you perhaps already know i
called at your hotel-or at least it was
the one you gave me-to arrange mat-
ters and get them settled up quickly
i do not need to tell you that the clerk
there informed me you had departed
only a short while before leaving no
new address

  the playwright stared fixedly at the
man before him only by great effort re-
fraining from breaking in upon him and
demanding an end to the uncertainty

   i left word that if you called to tell
you i wished to see you on my way
down-town i met a friend who told me
of a new play that was in the final re-
hearsals in paris and for which great
things were predicted and with the
english rights still open

  myers was not looking at walker as
he talked so did not see the sudden
change in the others face indeed the
american was swaying in his chair as
if he were about to swoon but the
manager kept on

   so i jumped over to paris-i saw
the play-and have the signed contracts
for the english production here in my
pocket


the argosy

  he glanced up at the man before him
and his face clouded at what he saw
there

  walkers head had sunk upon his
chest and he swayed back and forth as
if every few seconds he would fall to
the floor but as the other stopped
talking the dramatist quickly braced up

  then you-dont want-my play
he inquired thickly

   i cant use two the manager de-
clared  and i like this new one better
than i do yours of course it may not
be as good but i have seen it tried out
so i feel practically safe in taking it
his voice lowered to one of real sym-
pathy

   i hope you will soon find a manager
to produce yours walker i really
think it excellent and-

   yet you dont want it yourself
walker said in a hollow voice

  why how can i use it myers
returned impatiently  really its your
own fault that we have not already
signed our contracts i had decided to
take it and went to find you if you
hadnt changed your hotel-

  youd have taken it walker in-
terrupted bitterly

   exactly why wed already have
begun to pick the cast here is your
manuscript

  the other took it mechanically and
for a moment neither spoke walkers
eyes had a far-away look in them as he
stared at the opposite wall then his
face hardened and he burst out vin-
dictively 

   that american hes to blame 
 what do you mean myers queried
 i mean- the playwright paused
then seemingly bringing himself back to
the present a look of despair spread
over his countenance- i mean that-
ive reached the end-of my rope
the manager stared questioningly at
him but before he could inquire fur-
ther walker rose from his chair and
strode rapidly from the room venting
his spite upon the world in general by
noisily slamming the door after him

v

  walker hurried back to his hotel as
one in a semiconscious condition so

dazed was he over the terrible disap-
pointment he kept muttering in an
undertone failure failure

  in fact his actions seemed so strange
to the passers-by that many of them
turned and stared after him thinking
he must be mentally unsound

  when he reached his hotel he rushed
directly to his room where he remained
in a sort of stupor for some time he
stared unseeingly at the opposite wall
a dull blank expression in his eyes

  then suddenly they lighted up with
a gleam of rage and he sprang to his
feet

   that american  he cried as he
paced up and down the narrow room
 hes to blame for it all he forced
me to change my hotel he forced me
to miss myers he forced me to fail-
ure  

  his teeth ground together and he
added in a tone that almost resembled
a whistle as the words shot through
them  if i had him here now id do
something desperate-something i would
regret later

  sheer exhaustion-mental and physi-
cal-at last caused him to slow down
from the steady stride with which he
had continued to pace back and forth
and a few moments later he flung him-
self upon the bed where tired out na-
ture quickly closed his eyes and he fell
into a heavy sleep

  the next morning he felt quite him-
self again the recollection that with-
in the next twenty-four hours he would
be on his way to new york had a cheer-
ing effect london had grown positive-
ly distasteful to him and he looked for-
ward eagerly to a return to his native
land

  after breakfast he carefully placed
his check-book in his pocket and started
out for the express office having already
planned to secure the cash and then go
to the steamship companys office for his
ticket it was early in the summer so
he was sure of finding accommodation

  as he stood before the cashiers win-
dow he noticed there was a strange man
behind the enclosure and his fingers
trembled with nervousness as-he pushed
the checks through the grating

   by the way mr walker the man
said as he glanced at the signature
at the end

of his rope



 there was a man here yesterday asking
if we had any idea where you could be
found

  the dramatist glanced up angrily and
a steely glitter showed in his eyes

  there was he repeated slowly

  yes and he seemed anxious to lo-
cate you i made a memorandum of it
the fellow fumbled among some papers

   ah here it is his name is mr
dempster

  walkers expression softened

   tell mr dempster if he calls
again that i am leaving town very sud-
denly he said  and as i will be miles
away before he will know where i have
been staying it is no use leaving an ad-
dress for him tell him-tell him-
there was just a faint trace of a choke
as he added  i may see him in new
york this winter

  walker hurried to the street after
counting his money

   i suppose i ought to see miss bailey
before i go he mused  but i simply
cannot nerve myself to the ordeal be-
cause it is an ordeal to me-forced to
listen to the achievements of others
then she would probably have callers
and-yes dempster might drop in too
 shall not give him the opportunity of
telling me of his great success when i
cant come back at him with regard to
myself except with the plain unvar-
nished statement-im at the end of my
rope perhaps things may change be-
fore the winter and then ill be glad to
see him but not now and he shook
his head decisively

  the anticipation of the trip seemed to
lighten his mind of a great load as he
left the steamship office the rest of
the day found him in a cheerful mood-
something so new to him for so many
weeks that he marveled at it he spent
the afternoon sightseeing - there were
many points of interest he had over-
looked-and that evening the packing of
his trunk seemed to give him a new lease
on life

  the next morning he awoke to find
the sun streaming into his window and
this tended to increase his good spirits
he had a pleasant smile for the hotel
help with whom he came in contact and
even extracted from his small supply of
cash a little token for eaclione

  the cab that had been summoned was
already waiting at the door when he de-
scended to the office and paid his bill
while his luggage was being loaded upon
the vehicle

  all walkers troubles had faded into
insignificance when he entered the car-
riage  the driver mounted his box and
with a snap of his whip the dramatist
realized that his unsuccessful stay in
london was about to draw to a close

  the cab drew up before the st pan-
cras station where the boat train started
and the playwright watched the porters
as they took charge of his baggage it
lacked a half hour of the time for the
train to depart but lie made his way to
his carriage and took a seat by an open
window from which point he watched
the busy throng upon the platform

  so completely taken up was he with
the scene before him that he did not
hear his name called by a young man
and not until this same person stood di-
rectly by his window did he notice him

   walker for heavens sake come out
here a moment  the newcomer ordered
 i must see you

  in surprise he turned toward the voice
and recognized carroll dempster for
one brief second the dramatist hesitated
then he hurried to the station platform
his curiosity as to what this man wanted
spurring him on

   he cant talk very long he con-
soled himself as he stopped in front of
the actor

  a glance at the clock showed that the
train would leave in ten minutes

   well of all of the will-o-the-wisps
ive ever heard of you are the worst
dempster declared wringing the play-
wrights hand  ive hunted london
from one end to the other and now
that ive got you just as you are leaving
town i must talk quickly in the first
place you must stay here another week

  walker stared at the man in astonish-
ment

   why impossible dempster  he
exclaimed  ive already got my cabin

   never mind that the other insisted
 travel is light at this time of the year
and the steamship company will change
your ticket for some future date
youve got to do it because i reallv
crossed the ocean to see you


the argosy

   i dont understand the dramatist
faltered

  suddenly the thought that the pur-
chase of his ticket had used up nearly
all his money and that at the present
time he did not even have enough to
pay for a weeks stay at a good hotel
caused his positive response

   i really couldnt do it dempster
ive got to get to new york on this
steamer very important

   important eh  the other mimicked
 there is something far more impor-
tant to you right here in london and
you will stay at my hotel as my guest
and go back next saturday with miss
bailey and myself i want that play of
yours

   you want-my play  cried walker
in a tone of utter astonishment

   yes  want it and i came to lon-
don to get it ive had a merry chase
after you and now i want my answer
do  get it

  before the dramatist could overcome
his surprise and joy enough to reply the
train beside them pulled slowly out of
the station he had not even heard the
guards call of  all aboard  

  come do i get it dempster re-
peated

  a smile scattered itself over walkers
countenance and he broke into a hearty
yet nervous laugh

   of course if you want it

   then come with me the actor went
on  you are my guest for the next
week but first of all well get your
steamer ticket exchanged for next weeks
boat ill telegraph ahead to hold your
luggage until then

  walker had as yet been unable fully
to grasp the import of the good news
and as dempster returned to his side
and led the way to a waiting cab he
queried  how do you know you want
the play you havent read it have
you

   i certainly have was the quick
reply  i chanced upon it in new
york seldon  co the play-brokers
have a cpy and while there one day
they gave it to me to read i saw im-
mediately what i could do with it and
after going over the script thoroughly i
put it up to my managers they had
had it some time before they said but

had passed it up but were willing 
should try it if i saw anything in it
upon inquiry i found you had gone to
london so took a trip across killing
two birds with one stone-a short vaca-
tion and an endeavor to find you

   and you succeeded in both walker
laughed

   yes but came very near failure the
other interposed  ever since i saw
you in the express office that morn-
ing-

   you  a look of blank amazement
came over the dramatists face he
stared at the other and a look of under-
standing showed itself

   tall american-gray suit he mum-
bled

   and when  went to your hotel and
you had moved without leaving any ad-
dress- say walker what ails you

   nothing really  but the playwright
smiled strangely as he made this reply

   well all right but you look con-
foundedly funny just as if you had seen
a ghost then miss bailey told me she
had seen you and that you were to be
with us at her dinner but you didnt
show up i was mighty disappointed
and as she said you spoke of sailing to-
day i came down to the boat train
luckily for me i caught you just as-

   just as i reached the end of my
rope walker interrupted

   what do you mean   the other
queried

   nothing just a saying of mine
used in connection with theatrical man-
agers

   well i felt  had reached the end
of mine as far as securing a play for
miss bailey and myself was concerned
dempster said then in a cautious whis-
per added its a secret walker but
ill let you in on it miss b and i are
engaged to be married and i guess itll
take place as soon as we get to new
york naturally we would like to play
together and although the majority of
managers object to such an arrangement
mine have consented providing we find
the play

   but mine is a mans play walker
said fearfully

   i know it but there is a fine part
for miss bailey and we have a new
idea regarding it whereby it can be
twenty-four

hours start



greatly strengthened that work is up
to you if you agree as soon as we
strike broadway youll get the signed
contracts and the advance royalties is
it a bargain  

   heres my hand on it was
walkers answer

   bully  cried dempster in his
hearty way just ahead is the steam-
ship office well get your tickets
changed then on to my hotel

  the cab pulled up at the curb and
both men sprang to the pavement

   while youre inside im going to
telephone miss bailey dempster said
 you see i told her nothing of my
plans regarding your play until yester-

day morning i wanted to surprise her
thursday night with the good news
she told me then you had phoned her
but she did not know where you were
the clerk at the hotel where she
dropped you informed us that you had
left

   and so i had walker turned and
looked the other straight in the eyes
 do you know dempster that but for
you i would have placed my play with
myers the manager

   how is that   the other queried in
surprise

   never mind now this sidewalk is
not the choicest place to converse ill
explain some day

twenty-four hours start

                      by burke jenkins

                       the sad state of an ambitious young man
                       doomed forever to be a trailer and worse

the astrologer swore roundly
though not in persian when
the little bell tinkled cheerily in an-
nouncement of another arrival

  of course it meant more money but
even so public a servant as a reader of
the stars for struggling humanity cer-
tainly must have some time to himself it
was already eleven-thirty and he had
made it a rule to give no audiences later
than eleven

  indeed when was he to get any sleep
did he not have a date with a star that
was to rise about  am the meeting to
take place on his roof with a telescope
as chaperon

  but though he grumbled thus clian-
edra the soothsayer whose advertisement
appeared every sunday tucked his feet
into his tasseled slippers drew on his
somber cloak dropped into his most
effective stride opened the door and
gave entrance to his visitor

  that the young fellow who rushed in
excitedly needed something was most evi-
dent and perhaps he was right in think-
ing that here was the place he could get
it x

  you are chanedra the astrologist  
he cried wildly

   i am admitted chanedra calmly
both for effect and to moderate the oth-
ers nervousness wont you be seat-
ed

  the young man sat down tentatively
on the very edge of the chair indicated
and jumped into wordiness

   now it isnt that ive got any faith
in predictions or fortune-telling or any-
thing of that sort he began  but its
just as the very last resort this things
got to be stopped  its got to be explained
or something its getting too much for
me 

   just a minute my dear fellow in-
terrupted chanedra coldly if you have
no faith why are you here and if i
am to follow your story suppose you be-
gin with some common source that both
of us can understand

  the evenness of the astrologers tone
told upon the youth

   i never noticed the thing until after
i had graduated from college he went
on in a far more collected manner  in-
deed the very first instance was the time
i tried to -start the galloper

   you are still too vague for me
broke in the seer

   well then ill state facts as clearly


the argosy

as  can as  indicated  graduated
some four years ago i was accounted
bright enough in my studies and ranked
well enough up  was rather versatile
of accomplishments and found some
difficulty in deciding upon my vocation in
life finally however it seemed best to
me to start a newspaper in a small way
for i had been particularly successful in
college journalism

    accordingly i rented a little plant
with a front office and got out a first
edition of what i was pleased to call the
galloper i worked pretty hard on the
make-up of the sheet and was more than
satisfied when i scanned it over before i
sent it out but not fifteen minutes
after the papers left the place an ac-
quaintance of mine came trotting into
the office

     well said he with a grin  im
blamed if  can see the joke in the thing
dobson but i suppose its some new
advertising wrinkle of yours

    whatre you talking about i
asked him

    why look here he slipped from
his pocket a copy of my new paper the
galloper then he once more fished into
his coat and brought out another paper

     look at the elate on this said he

     why its the th said i  its my
first issue

     now look at this one and he prof-
fered the other sheet to me

    that paper which bore the strongest
possible likeness to my own was dated
the th

    what the-

     and whats more continued he  i
bought this paper yesterday

     what   cried

  then you know nothing of it

     not  i answered truthfullybut he
went away laughing at what he took for
my drollery

   three more days i tried to run that
paper but every one of my editions had
been duplicated and set on sale and
mark you this before a day before i had
printed them myself or indeed had even
written half of them somebody cer-
tainly had a wonderful scoop  me

   then one night  had an idea come
lo me while i was in bed it was a patent
for an automatic door-opener it wtas
practical in every detail-worked to a

nicety i got out my model of it and
sent it to washington

   the result after the customary
delay i received a letter along with my
model which was therewith returned
the letter stated that by the most re-
markable coincidence they had issued the
patent rights upon an identical affair
such as mine which they had received
the very day before mine arrived at the
patent office the letter qyen intimated
that they wondered how  should have
got hold of the idea so soon can you
beat that

   then i wrote a novel and took it to
a publisher i saw his brow cloud as he
scanned the opening sentences of my
manuscript then he turned  me
sharply

     you made a little mistake in bring-
ing this particular manuscript to me
said he  for it happens that i have just
only yesterday consented to publish the
original

   the thing was getting on my nerves
by now four other attempts i made to
forestall my unseen and premature copy-
ist until finally to-night the last straw
fell on me im not boring you 

   scarcely answered the astrologer
softly

   of course you must know the
young man continued  that my best
efforts to succeed in the world were being
put forth in the hope of inducing a cer-
tain young lady to share her fortunes
with-

   a-ha  sibilated chanedra  they
are always in things

    yes assented the other  and this
very night frenzied almost beyond my-
self i rushed over to her house threw
myself at her feet and poured out my
love for her would she come to me and
let us make our way together

    and the result 

   listen she was kind too kind for
i guessed even before she had said it
only last night she had been proposed to
and had accepted that mythical mystical
enemy of mine 

   what  cried the astrologer be-
trayed into genuine surprise  you
have even seen this other

   oh how ive tried but something
almost uncanny always prevents my run-
ning up with him hes a veritable will-
it is the man



o-the-wisp to me though hes anything
but such to others

   but tell me have you ever heard of
such a case  am i losing my mind  can
you help me 

  chanedra rose languidly and stepped
over to where a ponderous volume lay
open upon a small table

   where were you born  he asked as
he turned the pages

   i was born in philadelphia

   when  be exact as to time

   the morning of july  

  for a full five minutes the seer con-
sulted the page then he turned slowly
upon his caller and said

   there is little i can do for you
young man but i can help you to
understand the most unfortunate circum-
stances under which you were born
how what the other cried
eagerly

   well it happened that upon the
morning of the th of july of that very
year and in the self-same city of phila-
delphia this  other  you speak of was
born you see the significance dont
you the same stars ruled the planets
at that time and so the same destinies
will be yours but with this exception
-he has twenty - four hours start of
you 

   you must be mistaken youre chaf-
fing me how do you know when the
fellow was born anyway a-ha now
ive got you  

   have you well it appears that
again he had the head start of you for
in this very room at this very hour last
night  gave him a reading and advised
him to propose to the girl

   great heaven and i  must i
go through my entire life doing the things
this scoundrel does on the following
day

   i see no other way answered the
seer compassionately

   then ill kill myself  cried the
miserable young man

   im afraid even that is denied you
answered chanedra calmly  for as he
happens to have achieved the object of
his heart and sees a happy life before
him it seems to me that he will be the
last man to commit suicide of course
you understand that lie must do the deed
the day before you can ever hope to
carry out the purpose

  then it was on that instant that the
visitor dashed madly out into the mid-
night  while chanedra the astrologer
folded another dollar bill among the
others winked at the telescope and
crawled into bed

it is the man

            by marie b schrader

     a story about two men and a woman with an experiment
     in boat-sailing as an important episode in the game

 t ust what i wanted

  j edward grant threw down the
letter but quickly picked it up again
and read it over again carefully

   talk about the force of thought and
all that sort of thing i would like to
know how you explain this he said to
the friend who was whiling away an
hour of a dull afternoon in idle chat

  what is it inquired the visitor
 a prospective sale of property 

   i wish it were answered the real-
estate man  not business pleasure
pure and simple and i mean to forget
that there is such a word as  property 

   easily said returned his compan-
ion  but in times like the present it is
i fear a subject which eant readily be
dismissed

   business is dull went on grant
 and thats one reason why i am glad
to escape for a while from the worry of
it for several days i have been think-
ing of leaving town but hadnt settled
upon a definite plan i tried to remem-
ber where my different friends spend
their week-ends but couldnt locate a
single one of them just when t had
about determined to remain at home
along comes this invitation its from


the argosy



hudson you know wellington hud-
son

   the fellow who won the race last
year with his yacht the sylphide

   the same answered grant  hes
a bully sort money to burn and he
burns it too two automobiles and
property galore all he has to think
about is what he will do to amuse him-
self for the past month he has been at
athol beach he wants me to join him
for a visit needless to say i shall not
think twice before accepting flere
goes

  with these few words grant rang a
messenger call and busied himself with
the wording of his telegram which con-
sisted of the one word  delighted

   i dont believe in stringing out a
wire to ten words just because i have the
privilege of sending that many for the
same cost as one he explained in an-
swer to his friends expression of surprise
at his brevity

   when do you leave grant 

   as soon as i can pack my steamer-
trunk the first train out will suit me
but what about business matters
there are none my assistant brown
will attend to everything i am not going
to europe you know and can get back
on short notice

  he looked at his watch

   i must hurry if i am to catch that
three oclock train it is usually crowd-
ed on fridays so long old chap

   by the way grant dont drift into
a summer flirtation while wading in the
briny

  oh dont worry i can take care of
myself besides i am not susceptible
i have the technique down fine but i
never have put my heart in the game
then too flirtations are to say the least
expensive

  he hustled things and was set down
at his friends stopping-place late that
afternoon

  he looked around for hudson and dis-
covered that gentleman at one end of the
piazza almost completely concealed from
view by a circle of young women of
various types and ages they were all
enthusiastic over something he was tell-
ing them which later proved to be noth-
ing newer than the old old story of how
his yacht won the race

  they had all heard it before but no
one was willing to admit that fact men
were too scarce to worry over their petty
weaknesses

   hallo grant  exclaimed hudson
with a genuine tone of hearty welcome in
his voice  your telegram said  de-
lighted the expression is mutual i
never was so glad to see anybody in my
life

  thereupon he introduced every woman
in the circle grant scanned them all
casually and then his host exeused him-
self and the two strolled off down the
piazza

  now old chap said hudson turn
yourself loose the place is yours we
will do anything you say go anywhere
you like what do you think of the
ladies 

  grant gave him a bored look

   oh i know how you size them up
went on hudson  but what is a fellow
to do  one must have society of some
kind and after all they mean well

   oh these people who mean well 
complained grant  to tell the truth
it would be a refreshing change to find
some one who isnt so anxious to please
 there is one of that very type right
here in this hotel said hudson  i
have been wondering how she exercises
such a powerful fascination over all the
men the women hate her that goes
without saying she is the sort who
doesnt care about anybody or anything
unless she wants to and several men
have already proved that she doesnt
want to care about them she says what
she thinks regardless of the results

   i dont intend to give you the idea
that she is rude nothing of the sort
she is only thoroughly independent a
spoiled child has had her own way all
her life and is dreadfully stubborn in
consequence

   i see remarked grant  every
man bows before her consequently she
doesnt care about any of them

   thats it exactly answered hud-
son  how well you understand she
is utterly different from any other girl
you ever met before

  is she inquired grant with a
quizzical look  do you know much
about women 

   my dear boy they are like open
it is the man

c

books to me all their little idiosyncra-
sies of temperament-all their petty
tricks why i have never met one who
could mystify me

   except this one 

  well yes except this one

  and you are in love with her

   how lid you guess it 

   intuition i suppose

   i dont mind owning that i am
however i am not alone i wish i were
every man in the hotel is mad about her
she is young beautiful and wealthy
what more could one desire

   nothing replied grant  if all you
say is true but old fellow youve got
to show me ive heard of these para-
gons of beauty and wealth before and
the description given me by the infatu-
ated man was never a true likeness of
the baffling original no detective could
have used it as a trustworthy aid in a
search for the heroine

   wait until you see her said hud-
son  shes out on the walk now

   sorry i must restrain my impa-
tience rejoined grant with a good-na-
tured smile  she probably wont pay
any attention to me either

   i guess youre right

   well i like that said grant some-
what piqued

   have you registered yet no come
right up to the desk then we will go
up to your room

   hudson youre too kind

   nothing of the sort come we will
go up and look things over

  for a moment hudson appeared em-
barrassed then added in a hesitating
voice

   i have engaged the room next hers
for you

   you did how singular that you
should chance to get it  

   singular nothing of the sort i
had all kinds of trouble in getting it
you sec old fellow i have been just a
little bit selfish in inviting you down
here my rooms are on the next floor
and i thought that when you came down
-er-the walls re very thin-and when
we talked-er you see her room is
right next to yours and-

   i understand broke in grant  you
intend that we shall have some confiden-
tial chats concerning your appreciation

     a

of her charms she quite by accident
of course will overhear us and her esti-
mation of you will go up ninety per
cent

   my dear boy youve struck it how
clever you are

  at this point in the conversation they
entered the elevator as grant removed
his hat he looked up and there beside
him stood one of the prettiest young
women he hadever seen

  there was a certain modesty combined
with independence in her bearing that
attracted him instantly and when she
raised her large brown eyes they seemed
to go straight through him

  hudson greeted her warmly

   how did you enjoy your afternoon
miss wakefield he inquired politely

   oh immensely she replied with a
sweet smile

  grant pinched hudsons arm

   oh miss wakefield went on hud-
son  may i present my friend mr
grant of new york

  miss wakefield recognized the intro-
duction with a- charming but indifferent
smile

  hudson gave grant a significant look
as much as to say  how did that strike
you   but that gentleman merely re-
turned the greeting perfunctorily and
then turned his head the other way

  all three stepped out on the same floor
the young woman nodded to them and
walked rapidly down the hall hudson
and grant strolled leisurely after her

  so thats the wonderful creature
exclaimed grant

  how did you figure it out asked
hudson in surprise	

  oh shes the only one who came
anywhere near your glowing descrip-
tion answered grant nonchalantly

  miss wakefield had already disap-
peared within her room as the two en-
tered the adjoining one

   well here we are said hudson
 ill stay down fof a while its time
to dress for dinner you can go ahead
while i talk then we will go up to my
room and you can talk while i dress

  he leaned over to grant and added
in a whisper

   she can hear every word i will
start the conversation now and you must
help me out


jthe argosy

   i understand whispered grant in
return  fire away now let me see
you want to impress her with the intensity
of your admiration thats the idea
isnt it  

   thats it answered hudson in a
whisper  here goes

   the young lady i introduced you to
in the elevator is the one i have told you
so much about he went on in tones a
little louder than he ordinarily employed

  oh exclaimed grant  you dont
mean it  

   why you say that as if you were
surprised returned hudson

  well i was admitted grant  you
told me she was very beautiful and
charming and-

  hudson slapped him approvingly on
the back and whispered

   old man youre all right keep it
up keep it up

  then aloud he continued

   so i did words are inadequate to
express all that i would like to say about
her there isnt another girl in the place
who can compare with her now isnt
she all that i have said isnt she the
most beautiful-

   thats just it broke in grant  a
moment ago you said that i appeared
surprised when i discovered that she was
the object of your adoration and the
reason was-

  he hesitated a moment then added in
resounding even tones

   hudson i cant agree with you you
have greatly overestimated her charms
she must have hypnotized you

  hudson looked blankly at grant for
a moment then said in a low voice

 by jove old chap youre a born act-
or  for a moment i almost thought
you meant every word of it however
i didnt expect you to go as far as that
as far as what asked grant

   why most fellows would have tried
to beat me out at the game of winning
her good opinion they would move
heaven and earth to let her know how
much they admire her instead of that
you are deliberately ruining yourself
with her while my stock goes way up
i couldnt have asked you to do such a
thing but its a great idea blaze away
hudson chuckled to himself as grant
continued in a loud voice

   and you think she is beautiful  

   very answered hudson enthusi-
astically and so graceful

   i consider her only rather pjetty
she certainly has no pretensions to
beauty went on grant  have you
met miss anderson now i wouldnt
hesitate one second in calling her a
beauty then theres the selclen-mason
girl shes another i could name any
number who have your  beauty  left at
the post as for grace she is not awk-
ward but she isnt graceful either

   grant i wont permit you to say
such things you must be blind

 i am responded grant  as far as
some women are concerned by the way
theres a favor i want to ask of you
 anything you like old man said
hudson

   it is this dont mention to miss
wakefield that i am anything but a
plain ordinary man promise me

   certainly answered hudson

   for instance continued grant you
neednt mention my financial standing
 oh i wouldnt think of speaking
about that replied hudson

   good i wouldnt are to have her
know about my real estate and all that
the moment you say property some wom-
en imagine that you are so much richer
than you are by the way i got rid of
that million-dollar piece of land the
other day it has been bothering me to
death i didnt know what to do with it
now i dont have to think about the
thing any more so you see i have
nothing to worry me while down here

   thats fine exclaimed pludson
then he returned to his subject  miss
wakefield is very intellectual he said

   is that so inquired grant  one
would never imagine it by the way
hudson dont mention the fact that i
write will you and dont by any
chance tell any one that i can play the
piano some time i will play you my
latest composition but not down here
i want to get away from all these things
my latest novel will be out soon ill
send you a copy after i am gone you
can mention these facts but at present i
prefer to be plain edward grant no-
body can possibly interest me so i dont
want to be bothered with answering ques-
tions about what i have done
it is the man



   my dear grant said hudson in a
low voice  you have finished yourself
completely to tell the truth i was
just a bit afraid of you as far as miss
wakefield was concerned but after all
you have just said she wont even look
at you

    tell her any old thing you like about
me returned grant in a loud voice
 except the truth tell her i am a
bookkeeper if you care to do so 

  as he finished grant looked at his
watch

    you have just fifteen minutes to get
into your evening clothes he said

  a quarter of an hour later the two
men found themselves on the way to the
dining-room hudson stopped to talk
with a tall dignified elderly woman who
proved to be mrs wakefield she took
an immediate liking to grant much to
hudsons discomfiture for try as he
might he had never succeeded in im-
pressing the lady with his good points

  he was rather surprised when she in-
cited him and his friend to join herself
ind daughter at their table

   mr wakefield and my sister have
gone to new york she explained so
there will be two vacant places

  needless to say hudson was delight-
ed grant accepted as a matter of
course miss wakefield joined them a
little later and grant found himself in
close touch with her however he per-
mitted hudson to fill all the spare time
for small talk that the young woman
donated

  hudson put forth his best powers of
conversation and when the meal was
half over was so satisfied with his own
efforts that he conveyed his pleasure
thereat by covert glances at grant

  miss wakefield only spoke to the new-
comer now and then and he never ven-
tured to endeavor to draw her into a chat
it was always she who introduced the
various topics

   everything of interest at the seaside
resort wras discussed and then miss
wakefield mentioned the titles of several
popular novels which she had read she
criticized them in regard to characters
and plots until grant remarked

   you seem greatly interested in books
miss wakefield

   oh i am she replied  arent
you

   not at all answered grant giving
hudson a look as if to command silence
on his part

  how strange exclaimed miss
wakefield  i am rather a good student
of the peculiar characteristics of differ-
ent persons and from my experience in
analyzing faces heads and hands i
should say that you ought to be exceed-
ingly interested in literature of all kinds
 there is only one book i read said
grant  but that one doesnt consume
much of my time and i dont enjoy it
i read it completely through from start
to finish in two glances the end is a
sad one

   and what book can that be  asked
miss wakefield with undisguised curi-
osity

   my bank-book of course replied
grant with a smile and turned his at-
tention to mrs wakefield

  he was apparently absorbed in listen-
ing to her remarks but distinctly heard
miss wakefield say to hudson

   your friend seems to be a clever
fellow

  think so answered hudson care-
lessly   by the way miss wakefield
what about that sailing party

   oh i havent thought much about
it beyond suggesting that we have one
was the reply

  then she returned to grant and in-
quired 

   are vou fond of the water mr
grant 

   i love it he answered

   so do i she continued with enthu-
siasm  many persons dont care much
about it-that is about sailing if it is
a trifle rough you know-

   i understand broke in grant
 rough weather never affects me i
am a good sailor thats about the only
accomplishment i possess the rougher
the better for me

   it must be great to be out in a
storm  went on the young lady

   ive been in a number of them got
upset several times and so forth just
escaped drowning and all that

  oh exclaimed misswakefield in


the argosy

admiration  you must tell me all
about your experiences

  hudson frowned the idea of grant
figuring as the hero in a series of roman-
tic happenings didnt exactly appeal to
him accordingly he sought to  butt
into  the conversation

   miss wakefield is a splendid sailor
he said  and she can sail a boat with
the best of them she has promised to
look over my yacht when it comes down
havent you miss wakefield

   yes answered the girl politely
 but tell me mr grant do you know
anything about boats  

   i have studied them all my life
was the reply

   well then continued miss wake-
field  perhaps you can settle a disputed
point for me it all centers about the
management of a sailboat the most
fascinating chapter in  the green of the
sea  contains a situation which i con-
sider impossible im curious to know
what you think of it both from a literary
standpoint as well as from the possibility
of the thing i believe that such episodes
must be accurately described or not at
all then too i want your opinion con-
cerning the construction of the various
chapters

   but miss wakefield interrupted
hudson  grant knows nothing about
such matters he is not interested in
books are you grant  

  hudson gave his friend a piercing
look

   absolutely not quickly answered
grant

   oh i had forgotten that said miss
wakefield but you do know about
boats so that is enough i will explain
the entire story to you and you can give
me your ideas you must have some
ideas you know even if you dont wish
to have them she added with a charm-
ing smile

  a few moments later the dinner-party
broke up and the four people wandered
out on the veranda

   what do you say to a stroll on the
beach suggested hudson

  just the thing replied miss wake-
field  come with us mother mr
hudson will take care of you while mr
grant and i finish our little discussion
about the book

  with these words she gathered up her
skirts and taking grants arm in a
friendly fashion as if she had known
him all her life instead of but a few
hours started down the steps to the
boardwalk

  hudson stood for a moment as if
petrified he couldnt say or do any-
thing in the meantime the two figures
were rapidly disappearing in thecrowd

  it was mrs wakefields voice that
brought hudson back to a sense of the
conventionalities and politeness

   if you dont mind mr hudson will
you excuse me my daughter is such a
walker it is difficult for me to keep up
with her suppose you leave me and
join elizabeth and your friend if you
hurry i am sure you can overtake them

   i dont think i shall bother about
doing that replied hudson trying his
best to control his feelings

  after he had found a chair for mrs
wakefield he took himself to a dark
corner of the piazza where he smoked
a cigar and muttered into his mustache
all the expressive words of his vocabu-
lary

  the moon was sailing high when
from his sequestered refuge hudson de-
scried grant and miss wakefield return-
ing from the boardwalk they were
laughing and chatting in high spirits as
they came up the steps and strolled down
the piazza toward him

  he saw them looking at the occupants
of the rocking-chairs finally they
reached him

  ah here he is exclaimed grant

   where did you and mother disap-
pear to inquired miss wakefield then
without waiting for an answer  we
have had such a delightful evening
havent we mr grant we didnt no-
tice that you two people were not fol-
lowing us until we reached the casino
we were so interested in the boat ques-
tion

   well asked hudson with grim po-
liteness determined to die game did
you settle it 

   not yet answered grant

   but we will to-morrow added miss
wakefield  mr grant and i are going
to get up at six oclock and take a sail
there is nothing like practical demon-
stration in orderto prove things now
it is the man



he contends that the bdat could be han-
dled as it was in the book and i say it
cant by luncheon to-morrow we will
give you the solution

     shall await it with intense inter-
est remarked hudson with a tinge of
sarcasm

  now mr grant cautioned the
girl  be sure you areawake at six and
ready at six-thirty

    ill believe it when i see him he
wont be waiting for you its a safe
bet said hudson

   you may depend upon me miss
wakefield put in grant  i would
sit up all night if necessary

  with these words the young woman
said good night and left the two men to
themselves

  neither spoke for a few minutes
then hudson lit a fresh cigar and re-
marked 

    so you enjoyed yourself 

   now look here old man i know
how- you feel about it but if you will
think a moment you will see that i am
not to blame i understand and per-
haps i would be in the same sort of a
humor if i were in your place the
plain truth is the girl likes you but she
doesnt love you	

   what  exclaimed hudson in a
rage you have the nerve to tell me
this to my face 

    yes i have because i am sure you
can see things as i do miss wakefield
knows that you are in love with her
that you want to spend all your time and
all your money at her command de-
spite all this what does she do walks
off with a man she had only known a
few hours

   i suppose you mean me to draw the
conclusion that she is madly in love with
you-a case of love at first sight
sneered hudson

    nothing of the sort old chap leave
me out of it i dont count i have only
arrived you have been here a month
you have been with her every day of
that time now turn back the calendar
and see if you have made any progress in
her affections the best proof that you
have not is the fact that you sent for me
to help matters along

   and a fine mess you have made of
things too savagely remarked hudson

   you might as well be sensible about
it continued grant  whats the use
of worrying your soul out about some-
body who refuses to worry about you
didnt i do everything under the sun to
follow out your instructions

 yes you did answered hudson
then why blame me asked
grant  you cant make a woman love
you if she doesnt want to now can
you 

   youre right grant im several
kinds of a fool it isnt your fault
youve played square she seems to be
greatly taken with you but you said you
didnt admire her particularly it would
serve her right to fall in love with some
one who didnt return the feeling she
would get a dose of what i have had
go as far as you like old chap but dont
lose your heart

   im not very susceptible answered
grant evasively  but i will say that
she has a charming personality

   after a while you will-suddenly dis-
cover that she is beautiful said hudson
suspiciously

   maybe

iii

  the next morning bright and early
grant and miss wakefield set out for
thei sailing trip they returned half-
starved in the middle of the afternoon

   did you settle the question   asked
hudson

   why noanswered miss wakefield
with a blush  we became interested
in other things and forgot all about it
 we are going out again explained
grant  besides we couldnt have
settled the matter to-day for the sea
was smooth it is necessary for it to
be rough

  for several days hudson barely saw
grant except at meals for miss wake-
field was always needing his services

   i say hudson i dont feel quite
right in leaving you out as i am your
guest he remarked more than once

   oh thats nothing grant miss
wakefield invites me but i know she
does it merely from a senseof courtesy
how are you getting along

   famously

   have you discovered that she is
beautiful yet


the argosy

    not yet but she is graceful quite
intellectual too 

   ah  exclaimed hudson with a
world of meaning in his tone  by the
way have you put at rest that eternal
dispute over the boat

  no but i am sure you will be re-
lieved to learn that it is to be settled
to-morrow

   good   said hudson  and you
are going to get up at six again

    sure i cant miss it this time for
she has promised to set her alarm-clock
right by the door which separates our
two rooms

   so muttered hudson  youve
reached that stage have you

   the next day the alarm-clock aroused
grant at the promised hour by six-
thirty the two young people were on
their way to where their boat lay

    the sea is just right this tune re-
marked miss wakefield we wont
forget why we came will we 

    ill try- not to answered grant
with a long admiring glance which
caused her suddenly to turn her head
the other way

  they were soon seated in the boat
and sailing gaily over the choppy sea
the girl again explained the details of
the chapter to jiim and they maneuvered
with the sail

    you see it could happen just as i
said concluded grant

  then i was wrong asked miss
wakefield

    yes i am sorry

    oh i dont care

    it wont hurt you to be in the wrong
once went on grant  it would spoil
you always to be right

    see here interrupted the girl  do
i look like the sort of person who could
be spoiled

   no come to think of it you
couldnt be answered grant  al-
though to tell the truth when i first
came down here i did think so i take
it all back now will you forgive me 
 theres nothing to forgive she an-
swered

    isnt this an ideal day  he asked
with quick change of subject

   perfect the sky the sea and-
she hesitated -  everything is so con-
genial

  grant looked at her but she was
gazing out at the horizon

   the sky and the sea he repeated
what about ourselves

  ourselves she asked with an un-
certain query in her voice

  yes us two are we congenial

   why- she paused not knowing
just what to say

   shall i answer the question for my-
self

  she nodded and began playing with
a piece of rope that lay coiled near by

  you wont feel offended

   no she said in a low voice wait-
ing for his next words

   i have never known any girl like
you he went on  why theres so
much to you you that little word
spells everything that is good and beauti-
ful and-and sensible so few women
have real sense but youve got it i
would rather be with you than all the
other girls in the world put together

   mr grant  she exclaimed quite
overcome

   i mean it although i didnt intend
to tell you so to-day i wish that this
boat could sail on and on with us two
and never go back to land again

   oh that would be lovely she ex-
claimed quite carried away by his glow-
ing words and hardly realizing that she
had seriously committed herself

    do you mean it  he almost shouted

  oh she said  i-i-

   grant nearly fell over the side of the
boat in his haste to reach her and if
they had been closer to land the bathers
would have seen their first kiss

iv

  when the first happy realization of
their mutual affection was over they be-
gan planning the manner in which they
would break the news to mrs wakefield
and hudson

   we can tell them how we maneu-
vered with the sail said elizabeth
 and then we can gradually lead up
to- by the way we never did finish
that point about the construction of the
novel

   why i know nothing about writing
novels said hudson

 oh yes you do too you dear boy
it is the man



insisted elizabeth  you are a wonder-
ful man  cant compare with you
i am nothing but a girl of average abil-
ity while you you are a genius

  i a genius im nothing of the
sort protested grant

   youre too modest but theres one
thing i admire about you

   look here little girl what put it
into your head that i am a genius 

   why you did yourself and you
didnt want to let me know all the won-
derful things you can do

   i dont as yet quite understand
said grant

   i know all about you continued
the other  all about your novels and
your musical compositions and your real
estate

   oh exclaimed grant as the full
meaning of her words dawned upon him

   yes she continued   must say
that you used original tactics the
others were not willing to go on their
own merits but were obliged to resort
to artificial methods to attract me but
vou on the contrary concealed from me
your true identity and if walls had not
ears i should not have been the wiser
she threw both arms around his neck
in an impulsive girlish manner and
added

   youre the finest man ive ever met
grant disengaged himself from her
embrace and taking her two hands in
his looked her full in the eyes

 girlie he said  im afraid your
estimate of me will change when you
realize what  original methods  i used
a peculiar smile came over his glow-
ing face

   i have no excuse to make for my
actions he added  i throw myself
absolutely on your mercy

  elizabeth looked at him with a puz-
zled expression

 why what do you mean she
asked

   simply this replied grant  i saw
the mistakes that all these other fellows
had made in trying to win you and
realizing the fact that you were not to
be dazzled by hollow pretension and
also knowing that you are not the ordi-
nary type of girl i determined that it
was the man himself who would count
most in your esteem acting on that

  supposition and at the same time play-
ing  square  with my friend hudson
who did realize that walls have ears i
decided to reverse the usual order of
procedure

   instead of posing as a genius and
trying to carry out the bluff i simply
appeared as myself a person of no ac-
complishments whatever-only a young
business man who has yet to make his
mark in the world you are the only
girl i ever cared for what you think
of me now i dont know  but i ask you
again will you be my wife

  grant stood before her with strength
showing in every muscle and honesty
and determination in his face as the
boat neared the shore

  elizabeth did not hesitate a moment
she placed her hands in his

   your power of discernment did not
mislead you she said  it is the man
who has won my heart and hand

  do you really mean it exclaimed
grant hardly crediting his senses

  for an answer elizabeth looked at
him with a glance the meaning of which
he could not fail to read at this mo-
ment the sail swept around hiding them
from the view of those on the shore
and grant held her in his arms for one
brief moment while their lips met

v

  hudson was the first person to greet
them as they stepped ashore his pri-
mary inquiry was

   well have you settled the ques-
tion  

   yes old man the great question has
been settled and you are the first one
to offer congratulations  x
what exclaimed hudson

   its the truth hudson ive won
answered grant taking elizabeths hand

  hudson proved equal to the situation
and promptly extended his felicitations
then in a mischievous way he asked
 do you think she is beautiful now
 i never thought otherwise from
the moment i first saw her answered
grant as the three strolled toward mrs
wakefield who comfortably seated on
the beach was reading a book which was
none other than  the green of the
sea 
an enticing prospect

by ralph england

                      the matter of mountain air pretty girls and restful
                      quiet in selecting a location for a summer holiday

that you need my boy said

  w the doctor examining my
tongue with some concern  is a few
weeks of thorough rest

   your system is badly run down
youve been working too hard i pre-
sume you require recreation more
than medicine go out into the coun-
try select a nice quiet place up in the
mountains loaf there for two or three
weeks dont worry dont do any-
thing except bask in gods glorious sun-
shine and fill your lungs with fine
clear crisp mountain air that is all-
except my bill which is five dollars
please

   i handed the physician his fee and
went home to look over the summer re-
sort advertisements in the daily papers
in search of a suitable spot in the moun-
tains where  could take the rest cure
prescribed and endeavor to restore my
shattered nervous system

  there was apparently no dearth of
such places all advertisements sound-
ed so alluring that it was extremely dif-
ficult to make a selection

   each advertiser claimed that his par-
 ticular retreat was the best in the world
 each declared that the air to be breathed
 on his premises was the very finest
 brand of air to be breathed anywhere

   as for the quality of the food and
sleeping accommodations and the nat-
ural beauties of the surrounding scenery
none of the resort-keepers who adver-
tised was willing to yield first place in
these important respects

   the advertisements varied in phrase-
 ology of course some of them were
 written in the first person some in the
 third-at least three of them were in
 verse-the advertisers evidently being
 of the firm opinion that mere prose
 could not do justice to their establish-
 ments

some of the advertisements were in

big black type others were printed in
italics several were illustrated with
half-tone or line-cut pictures of preten-
tious looking hotels and farmhouses

  there was one little advertisement in
one of the papers however which was
a great contrast to all the others because
of the modesty of its claims

  it was a plain little six-line notice
which seemed quite out of place among
the more pretentious announcements
it read

    shady bower farm greene county
  situated in the heart of the catskill
  mountains  feet above sea-level
  bathing rowing and fishing free to
  guests good wholesome food board
  seven dollars per week

  it was the conservative tone of this
announcement which appealed to me
most of all 

  no doubt this fellows place is just
as good if not better than these others
i said to myself   it isnt always the
man who makes the most noise who has
the best wares to offer the proprietor
of shady bower farm is probably too
modest and too simple to proclaim the
merits of his establishment above a
whisper

  that fact spoke well for him in my
opinion i judged him to be an hon-
est simple child of nature uncontam-
inated by contact with the guile and
hypocrisy of city life who looked you
straight in the eye when he addressed
you and who would rather die than
dilute the milk

  there was something about the name
of the place too which attracted me
 shady bower farm   it certainly
sounded enticing i could almost
smell the new-mown hay and hear the
melodious swishing of the tree-branches
as they were swept by the keen invig-
orating mountain breezes


an enticing prospect



  and in addition the cheapness of
the board was an important considera-
tion most of the other advertisements
quoted prices far above my means

  seven dollars a week was really very
reasonable especially when rowing
bathing and boating were thrown in
gratis so i dccided upon shady bower
farm

  i wrote a letter to the proprietor ask-
ing for further particulars and stating
that i was a young man whose health
was somewhat impaired and who was
looking for a nice quiet healthy spot
in the mountains in which to recuperate

  i received a reply almost immediately
it was written in lead-pencil on ruled
paper and this fact pleased me im-
mensely it is a pet theory of mine that
the character of people can be judged
by their correspondence

  surely a man who used a pencil in-
stead of pen and ink and ruled paper
instead of a more pretentious letter-
head must be a simple unsophisticated
all-right sort of fellow i argued the
favorable mental picture of the proprie-
tor of shady bower farm which i had
already formed was heightened by the
receipt of this letter

  it read as follows

  dear friend

    i got your note and was very glad to
  hear from you if you decide to come

  i am sure i can make you comfortable
  and give you a good time

    my farm is really a very beautiful
  place folks do tell me that it is the
  prettiest spot in all the catskills i
  reckon they are jollying me some but
  come and see for yourself write me
  when you expect to arrive and i will
  meet the train with my rig

          yours respectfully

           farmer hiram snookins

  i liked the way that letter began
 dear friend  how delightfully
cordial and unconventional it sounded
surely a fellow who hailed you as a
friend before he had seen your face
would simply exude hospitality when
you were actually his guest

  i was cautious however i wrote an-
other letter to farmer snookins asking
him if he was quite sure that his place
was healthy and restful

  in response i got another penciled
epistle as follows

    healthy why we havent even got
  a graveyard around these parts five
  years ago a doctor located ten miles
  from this place he thought he was go-
  ing to make a comfortable living i
  reckon he is now an inmate of our
  county poorhouse i mention this to
  show you that we aint got no use for
  a physician around here we dont even
  need a horse-doctor our live stock
  never ails the pure mountain air keeps
  them healthy

    as for bein restful my dear friend
  let me assure you that shady bower
  farm cant be beat in that respect
  though i do say it myself

   this is the place where rip van
  ivinkle fell into his long sleep it
  wasnt no magic liquor which caused
  rip to doze off it was the restful at-
  mosphere of meritville greene county

  i guess i cant say no more when
  can i expect you 

 this sounded encouraging as a
matter of fact it sounded just a little
too encouraging to suit me

  in accordance with my physicians
advice i was seeking a quiet place but
i didnt want one that was too quiet

 i am young and romantically in-
clined and my vacation plans included
the summer girl what was the use of
free rowing bathing and fishing unless
there were pretty girls to row bathe
and fish with

  unless farmer snookinss place was
enlivened by the presence of the sum-
mer girl i decided that whatever its
other natural advantages shady bower
farm was not the place for me

  so i sent him a telegram inquiring

    are there any pretty girls stopping
  with you

  he replied by letter as follows

    pretty gals say my dear fellow
  ive got a score of them on my farm
  the young lady who won the beauty-
  prize recently offered by a new york
  newspaper is at present one of my
  boarders the others run her pretty
  close though when it comes to looks
  theyre the prettiest lot of gals ive
  ever seed in all my life come and take
  your pick of them ive told them that


the argosy

  youre coinin and theyre all terribly
  anxious to meet you

  that settled the matter  packed
my trunk bought a ticket wired farmer
snookins that i was on my way and
boarded a hudson river boat that very
day	

   left the boat at catskill landing
and took the mountain railroad to merit-
ville

  the train ride was long dusty and
uncomfortable but i comforted myself
with pleasant thoughts of shady bower
farm honest hospitable farmer hiram
snookins and his bevy of pretty girl
boarders - especially the young lady
who had won the beauty prize awarded
by a new york newspaper i promised
myself many delightful hours with this
proved possessor of pulchritude

   all out for meritville  shouted
the conductor at length  change here
for sayo hillside highbend canon-
bury and brookdale 

  quite a- few of us left the train
there were young men old men young
women old women whole families and
single solitary persons like myself who
stepped upon the platform

  i noticed a dozen or more farmers
rigs drawn up alongside the little depot
some of these rigs were quite smart
looking and all of them bore signs de-
noting their destination

  i scanned these signs eagerly i
read   dows fruit farm  sherman
house  swiss manor  hillside
villa  hotel canonbury etc on
various wagons but not a sign of any
vehicle from shady bower farm could
i discover

 my fellow passengers who had
alighted with me climbed aboard the
waiting wagons laughing and chatter-
ing and were driven away to their re-
spective destinations

  when the last of them had gone i
stood alone upon the deserted platform
gazing mournfully at my trunk and
dress-suit case and began to feel de-
cidedly dejected and uncomfortable

  farmer snookins had promised posi-
tively to meet the train and transport
me and my baggage his failure to
make good at the start did not look very
encouraging

  at length  approached a shabby
dirty - looking bearded man who stood
near a wagon which was even dirtier
looking than he was

   i had noticed this wagon before but
the idea that it could be used for the
transportation of passengers had not
occurred to me its appearance indi-
cated that it was there for the purpose
of hauling a load of mud or coal or
some such cargo

   i beg your pardon my friend i
said to the shabby dirty - faced man
 you havent seen anything of a rig
from shady bower farm have you

   sure he replied eying me with
surprise  there it is

   good heavens  i gasped seeing
that he pointed to the dirty dilapidated
wagon  surely not that-

   thats shady  bower farms rig
said he regarding me sternly  are
you mr mortimer collingwood the
new boarder

   yes i stammered and began to
wish myself back in new york

  the discovery that that wretched-
looking conveyance and the lialf-
starved weak-kneed horses attached to
-it were the property of my prospective
host was certainly a great shock but i
quickly rallied 

  i thought of the young lady boarder
who had won the beauty prize and the
score of other pretty girls who were to
be found at shady bower farm and i
began to make excuses to myself for the
appearance of that rig

   perhaps it was only a borrowed vehi-
cle i reflected maybe my hosts regu-
lar conveyance had broken down and
rather than disappoint me he had pressed
this outfit into service

  i turned to the man with a sigh of
relief

  where is farmer snookins i
inquired pleasantly

   i am farmer snookins he an-
swered gazing at me defiantly

   this certainly was shock number two
the proprietor of shady bower farm
sadly differed from the mental pictur i
had conceived

  in addition to being dirty shabby
and- unkempt he wasnt at all in ap-
pearance an honest simple child of
nature
an enticing prospect



  his face was extremely sinister-look-
ing his eyes were beady and instead of
looking you straight in the face he had
a habit of gazing at his large and ill-
shod feet

  i am optimistically inclined however

   after all i reflected  appear-
ances are often deceiving this fellowt
may possess a heart of gold despite his
ill-favored countenance

  i held out my hand impulsively

   farmer snookins i said  i am
very glad to meet you i hope that our
acquaintance will prove mutually pleas-
ant

  huh he grunted jump in the
rig and well be gettin along were
late already why in thunderation
didnt you tell me who you was before
is this here your trunk

  i nodded

   well youd better give me a hand
in gettin it into the wagon i reckon

  i complied there was something
about farmer snookinss demeanor
which forced compliance i began to
feel pretty miserable and decidedly un-
comfortable my hosts manner was
 more prepossessing than his looks

   i suppose its just surface gruffness
though i reassured myself still opti-
mistic  the natural gruffness of a son
of the soil i guess

  i climbed aboard the wagon and
farmer snookins seated himself beside
me and took the reins

  it was a long tedious ride and for
the most part a painfully silent one

  mr snookins was not much of a con-
versationalist it appeared he rarely
spoke unless i addressed myself to him
and then he generally replied in mono-
syllables

  the mans manner soon began to get
on my nerves there was something
almost uncanny about him as he sat be-
side me grim and silent

  my spirits began to grow more and
more depressed as the ride progressed
to add to my -discomfort the mountain
roads we traveled were so rough that i
was shaken and rattled until i was on
the verge of collapse if that wagon
had any springs at all they certainly
did not serve the purpose for which they
were put there

  how i wished now that i had not de-

cided to spend my vacation at shady
bower farm even the prospect of
meeting the bevy of beautiful boarders
including the fortunate winner of the
pulchritude prize could no longer
cheer me

  at length just as i was beginning
to believe that the ride would never
come to an end we drew up in front of
a dilapidated two-story farmhouse which
in wretchedness of appearance quite
matched -the wagon and farmer snook-
ins

  night had already descended but
there was not a single light in this
gloomy looking building-not even the
flicker of a candle in one of the win-
dows

  i turned to my companion fearfully

  what place is this  demanded
hoarsely but i knew intuitively what
his answer would be

   this is shady bower farm lie an-
swered and he added to the words a
chuckle that sounded positively fiendish

   get out he commanded  and
give a hand with the trunk dont sit
gaping there young feller everybody
helps on shady bower farm we
havent any use for shirkers around
here

   but i didnt come here to work
i protested indignantly

  of course i should not have minded
helping him with the trunk for it was
obviously too heavy for him to handle
alone but i resented the command-
ing tone in which he spoke and i made
up my mind that it was high time for
us to arrive at an understanding

   i never heard of a boarding-house
where the guests were expected to do the
work of a hired man i went on
haughtily  i do not wish to appear
disobliging mr snookins but i must
positively refuse to be bossed by you

  he shrugged his shoulders and
pursing his lips emitted a shrill whistle

  i heard a swishing in the long grass
and suddenly six of the most ferocious
boarhounds i had ever seen dashed up
to the wagon and began to growl and
snarl in a manner which filled me with
terror

   these here dogs belong to me said
farmer snookins quietly  at a word
from me they would tear you to pieces


the argosy

now are you going to give me a hand
with that trunk

   send away those dogs and ill do
anything you say i gasped my teeth
chattering with fear

  i assisted him in lifting the trunk into
the house the savage-looking dogs en-
circling us and snapping at me as i did
so in a manner that made my blood run
cold

  he led the way up a shorj flight of
stairs and with my help deposited the
trunk in a small front room

   this is your bedroom he said
 you can retire now if you like i
guess you must be tired after your long
trip

   im hungry i told him  it is
several hours since i dined arent you
going to give me some supper

   we dont serve suppers at shady
bower farm he replied coldly  if
youre up early to-morrow morning
youll get some breakfast good night
he poked his head in at the door
again a few seconds later

   i forgot to tell you that i let them
dogs run around lpose at night he re-
marked  theyre hungry and they
aint got any prejudice against human
flesh i merely mention this in case
you might be thinking of taking an eve-
ning stroll

  with these words he went out again
i flung myself dejectedly on the bed and
began to ponder upon the situation

  this was certainly the queerest board-
ing-house i had ever struck i was
being treated more like a prisoner than
a guest

  i made up my mind that i would
leave the place the next day

  i went to the window and throwing
it open gazed out at the surrounding
landscape

  there didnt seem to be another
human habitation for miles around-
nothing but farmlands and wild moun-
tain country from beneath my window
came the howls of one of the ferocious
boarhounds	

   i certainly shall not stay here any
longer than to-morrow morning even
if i have to pay a whole weeks board
in order to get away i said to myself
with a shudder  i wonder what kind
of people the other boarders are it is

queer they tolerate such tyrannical treat-
ment

  it suddenly dawned upon me that
perhaps there were no other boarders
i had not seen nor heard signs of any
my belief in the score of pretty summer
girls of whom farmer snookins had
boasted in his letter had vanished by
this time

  the proprietor of shady bower farm
had deceived me in other respects so
what reason was there for supposing
that his alluring letter had told the
truth about these beautiful maidens i
was fully convinced now that the young
lady who had won the prize for beauty
offered by a new york newspaper was
nothing more than a myth-a figment
of farmer snookinss imagination

   went to sleep at length for i was
so exhausted from my trip that even
my disappointment and my fears could
not keep me awake

  i was aroused at about six the fol-
lowing morning by the ringing of a
rising-bell

  i dressed hastily and hurried down-
stairs remembering that farmer snook-
ins had intimated that i would get no
breakfast unless i was early at the table

  i found my way unaided to the dining-
room farmer snookins was not there
but a young girl was laying the cloth
as i entered the room

  she appeared surprised to see me
and i was joyfully surprised to see her

  she was beautiful enough to be the
holder of the pulchritude prize the
farmer had mentioned in his letter she
was without doubt one of the prettiest
girls i had ever beheld although her
face was pale and her eyes looked as
if she had teen crying

  at sight of her i began to waver in
my determination to leave shady bower
farm immediately after breakfast

   perhaps this place isnt so bad after
all i mused  i might try to stick
it out for a day or two anyway

   good morning i said aloud

   good morning she replied very
cordially

   have i the pleasure of addressing
farmer snookinss daughter i in-
quired  for seeing that she was busy
laying the table i assumed that she must
be a member of the household
an enticing prospect

g

  she shook her head negatively

  are you employed here then 

  again she shook her head and step-
ping over to my side she whispered in
my ear these startling words

  i am a prisoner in this place like
yourself

 what i gasped you surely
cant mean that you-

   hush   she whispered  for
heavens sake not so loud or he will
hear us i came here as a boarder a
week ago i have been here ever since

   and do you mean to say that he
makes you wait at table and do the
housework  i exclaimed indignantly

  she nodded and her eyes filled with
tears

 why do you stand for it why
dont you leave i demanded

   i cant she replied with an ex-
pression that was pitiful  i am a pris-
oner here i cannot get away you
too will find that you-

  she did not finish the sentence for
just then farmer snookins entered the
room and took his seat at the head of
the table

   bring on the breakfast  he com-
manded gruffly

  the girl complied with a submissive-
ness that made my blood boil

  she brought in three platters of
corned beef some stewed corn and some
bread and butter

   sit down both of you the farmer
commanded us sternly

  tbe girl seated herself obediently at
the table so did i there was some-
thing about our hosts manner which
brooked no opposition

  we ate in silence after we had fin-
ished farmer snookins again addressed
himself to the girl

   go into the kitchen he commanded
 and shell the peas for dinner when
you get through with them you can
darn my socks

  if she had been under a hypnotic spell
she could not have obeyed him more
meekly

  after she had left the room he turned
to me

  what do you do for a living he
inquired

   i am an artist i replied

  a painter you mean

   yes

   thats good your talent will come
in handy my barn needs painting
that will keep you employed for the
balance of the day i reckon

   but i am not that kind of a paint-
er i protested  i paint pictures

   my barn is a picture he replied
grimly  dont argue with me young
man youd better get busy right away
 now see here i exclaimed sum-
moning all my courage  we might as
well have an understanding right now
mr hiram snookins i did not come
here to work as i told you in my let-
ter i came here for rest and quiet i
am paying you board and  dont in-
tend to be treated like a hired man i
wont stand for it in fact

   is that so he replied without the
slightest trace of emotion

  he went to the window and whistled
the six ferocious-looking boarhounds
came bounding over the window-sill
they looked even more powerful and
savage by daylight than they had ap-
peared in the dusk of the preceding eve-
ning

  they crouched obediently at his feet
the foam dropping from their cruel dis-
tended jaws a wicked light in their
bloodshot eyes

  going to paint that barn he in-
quired laconically

  of course i am i answered hastily
 i was only joking when i refused just
now if there is anything i enjoy it is-
painting barns where shall i find
paint-pot and brush  

   in the barn he answered  see
that you make a good job of it or youll
have to do it all over again i dont
like sloppy work youll find a ladder
there too get along now

   by the way mr snookins i said
timidly  i am sorry to have to inform
you that i shall have to leave you this
evening i have some important business
to transact in new york of course 
shall return here-when that business
has been attended to

  i looked at him eagerly as i said those
words would he fall for this none too
subtle ruse i wondered uneasily

   you will leave here when i get good
and ready to let you go be answered
gruffly  i guess that important busi-


the argosy

ness transaction in new york will have
to wait for a few weeks my friend
go along to your work now

  i walked toward the barn slowly and
sadly my brain was in a whirl my
heart was as heavy as lead

  could this be the twentieth century
and new york state was it really
possible that this fellow could keep me
here and make me do his bidding
against my will

  it certainly looked as if it were pos-
sible  for absurd as it seemed here was
 actually getting the ladder and paint-
pot out of the barn and starting in to
do the work of a house-painter-i who
possessed the soul of an artist and who
had come to this place on a physicians
instructions to take a short perfect rest

  and yet what else could i do to
make sure that i did not loaf farmer
snookins sent one of his boarhounds to
watch me

  the brute squatted on  his haunches
at the foot of the ladder and growled
so ominously every time i ceased slinging
paint that i worked more industriously
than i had ever worked in my life

  at noon my tyrannical host came to
summon me to dinner

  the meal consisted of cold roast meat
green peas and potatoes the girl laid
the table and then joined us as she had
done at breakfast i again noticed how
beautiful she was and the sad despair-
ing look on her pale face filled me with
a determination to find some means of
rescuing her and myself from our ex-
traordinary captivity

  after we had finished eating farmer
snookins announced that he intended to
make another trip to the railroad-station
that afternoon to bring back some more
guests who had succumbed to the lure
of his advertisement in the newspaper

  my heart beat joyously at his words
i fancied i saw a chance to escape from
this place while our captor was away

   glanced across the table at the girl
thinking that she also must perceive this
opportunity but to my surprise there
was not the slightest trace of hope on
her face

    wonder why she did not try to get
away yesterday wrhile farmer snookins
was at the depot bringing me here i
asked myself

  as though in answer to my un-
uttered thought our tyrannical host
spoke again

   i guess ill have to lock you up
in the barn while im away he said
 youd better not try to get out neither
for them dogs will be outside waitin
for you theyll be extra hungry and
savage too i havent given them any-
thing to eat this morning so as to be
sure that their appetites will be good
he grinned at the look of discomfiture
which i could not repress i understood
now why the girl had made no effort to
escape during the absence of our captor
on the preceding day

  true to his word after farmer
snookins had harnessed up the pair of
wretched - looking horses to the dirty
dilapidated wagon he put us inside the
barn and locked the door on the outside
with a padlock then he ordered his
six boarhounds to stand guard outside
and drove off confident that we could
not get away	

  after he had gone i looked at the
girl and the girl looked at me de-
spair was written on our faces

   this is a pretty state of affairs
i groaned

    it is terrible she replied with a
sob

   do you mean to tell me that you
have actually been kept a prisoner here
for a week i inquired

   yes and i fear i shall remain here
for the rest of my life she sobbed
 there doesnt seem to be any chance
of getting out of the clutches of this
odious wretch

   how did you come to select this
place i asked

    i was attracted by his advertisement
in the paper-the same as you were i
suppose she answered  i am a new
york school-teacher and i was looking
for a nice quiet place in which to spend
a few weeks of my vacation

   according to the advertisement
shady bower farm seemed to be just
the kind of place i sought and in
addition the board was very cheap i
wrote for further particulars and re-
ceived such a nice cordial letter in re-
ply that i packed my trunks and came
up here immediately that wretch can
certainly write nice letters
an enticing prospect



    yes i know-confound him i
 groaned  it was his letters that lured
 me here too what is his game any-
 way why does he act in this extra-
 ordinary fashion he must be crazy
  of course hes crazy replied the
 girl  havent you noticed the mad
 glint in his eyes he is violently in-
 sane do you know what he calls this
 place

    shady bower farm  believe he has
 named it

    oh thats what he calls it in the
 advertisement but hes got another name
 for it he calls it  the asylum for the
 sane he told me the other day with
 a fiendish chuckle that-there are so many
 institutions for insane people that he
 deemed it high time that the sane folks
 had an asylum too thats why he
 keeps us here	v

   how terrible  i gasped  do
 you mean to say that you havent had
 a single chance to get away in the past
 seven days

    how could i  those terrible dogs
 are running around loose all the time
 day and night they would tear me to
 pieces at the first opportunity and
 besides he goes about armed hes a
 regular walking arsenal he carries a
 loaded revolver in every pocket and he
 told me the first day i got here that he
 would fill me full of lead if i attempted
 to escape

  horrors i ejaculated but
 nevertheless we must find some way to
 escape we must match our wits against
 his cunning

    i wish we could she sighed  i
 am afraid though that our wits would
 avail us little against the teeth of those
 terrible dogs

 havent you had an opportunity to
 communicate with people on the out-
side   i inquired with a shudder
 surely you must have been able to get
word to somebody

    no hes too clever to permit
 that was her discouraging reply  he
 wont allow us to get within speaking
 distance of anybody thats why he
 locks us up in here when he goes to the
 railway-depot

    well dont your friends know that
 you are here didnt you leave them
 your address when you came i asked

with a sudden ray of hope if so they
will soon become alarmed at not hearing
from you and will come here to investi-
gate

    no they wont she answered sadly
 even though that farmer is insane he
is very shrewd he doesnt overlook a
single detail i have received several
letters from my friends since i have been
here

  he reads them all and he forced
me to answer them he makes me send
them pretty souvenir postals telling
them what a fine place this is and that
i am having a perfectly delightful time
i am obliged to write as he dictates-
otherwise he -threatens to set his dogs
on me i fully believe that he would
do it too

  good heavens how terrible i
gasped  i can see now that we are
going to have a hard job getting out
of this madmans clutches-but i am
going to find a way i added with as
much confidence as i could summon
under the circumstances

   oh it is brave of you to talk so
hopefully she declared regarding me
admiringly  it gives me courage to
hear you i am so glad that you are
here it makes this terrible situation
so much easier to bear

   i myself did not feel particularly glad
that i was there but i delicately re-
frained from telling her so

   by the way i remarked  we
might as well introduce ourselves to each
other my name is mortimer colling-
wood would you mind telling me
yours

  janet meredith she answered

   it is a pretty name i declared
 i am delighted to meet you miss
meredith-even under these most dis-
tressing circumstances

  it was evening before farmer snook-
ins returned and released us from the
barn

  he brought with him a nice-looking
young couple

   poor things i whispered to miss
meredith regarding the newcomers with
sympathy

  the young man appeared to be much
worried his wife was on the verge of
tears i could see at a glance that
farmer snookins had already begun to


the argosy

impress his new guests with his startling
idiosyncrasies

  we made their acquaintance on the
front porch the young man took ad-
vantage of an opportunity to take me
aside and whisper in my ear

   say old man he said anxiously

 what kind of a ranch is this anyway

i dont believe i like the fellow who
runs it at all

 youll like him still less when youve
been here a few days i retorted gtimly

   i dont intend to stay here a few
days he answered with a frown  my
wife and i are on our honeymoon we-
cant afford anything very swell and
when we saw his advertisement we
thought it would suit us perfectly

   we intended to stay here for three
weeks but that farmers manner doesnt
suit me at all hes already got my
wife frightened almost out of her wits
aveve got to stay over night i guess
it is too late to find another boarding-
house  but we shall certainly leave the
first thing to-morrow morning

   maybe youll stay here longer than
you think i said gently

   oh no we wont he answered in-
nocently  i dont like the looks of
the place at all-and besides there are
mosquitoes here one bit me on the nose
just now my wife and i cant stand
mosquitoes we shall leave right after
breakfast to-morrow morning

  i did not have the heart to impart
to him the cruel truth he would find
it out soon enough i reflected

   come here and give me a hand lift-
ing this trunk up to your room farmer
snookins commanded him sternly

   do nothing of the sort percival
exclaimed the young mans bride indig-
nantly  the idea of his asking such
a thing of you we did not come here
to work if he needs help with the
trunk let him get one of the farm-
hands

  farmer snookins did not make any
answer to this mutinous outburst he
merely pursed his lips and gave vent
to a shrill whistle

  i knew from bitter experience what
that meant the six ferocious boar-
hounds came bounding onto the porch
they encircled the young couple with
savage growls

  now said the farmerare you
going to give me a hand or are you
not 

  the young man assisted him in lifting
the trunk up-stairs it cannot be truth-
fully said that he did so cheerfully but
he certainly went about the task with 
plenty of alacrity

  the newly wed couple did not carry
out their intention of leaving shady
bower farm next morning for a more
congenial place very much against
their wills of course they started in to
spend their honeymoon by doing chores
for farmer snookins

  the young husband chopped wood
and made himself generally useful his
bride assisted miss meredith with the
kitchen work

   its a darned outrage the young
man confided to me when we had a
chance to exchange a few wordswithout
being overheard  it doesnt seem pos-
sible that such a state of affairs could
exist in these days and less than a hun-
dred miles from new york city we
really ought not to submit to it we
ought to stand together and assert our
independence

   perhaps we ought i replied  but
i dont think those dogs would receive
a declaration of independence from us
very graciously i guess youd better
keep on chopping wood and say nothing
for the present

  the young husband volunteered the
suggestion that it would be a good idea
to poison the dogs

  we all heartily agreed with him that
it would be an excellent idea but we
were sadly handicapped in its execution
by the lamentable fact that we were
quite unable to procure the necessary
poison

  i proposed making an attempt to get
away while the dogs were asleep but
miss meredith assured us that the brutes
never slept with more than one eye
closed and besides as she pointed out
farmer snookins always locked all the
doors at night and took away the keys

  during the day the dogs never let us
out of their sight

  i was a prisoner for a whole week
before i hit upon what really seemed
like a feasible plan of effecting our es-
cape

i
an enticing prospect



   mentioned it to miss meredith when
we had an opportunity to exchange a
few words alone

   ive got an idea i announced

   is it a good one  she asked eagerly
 well  think it will work listen
and ill explain it to you youve heard
of course of shipwrecked mariners
stranded on desert islands getting news
of their predicament to the outside world
by enclosing messages in glass bottles
which they cast into the sea 

   yes she assented eagerly

   well i intend to follow their ex-
ample  went on  i have managed
to get hold of a small glass bottle

   but i dont see how that could be
done she exclaimed  we havent any
sea to throw a bottle into and bottles
wont float on land you know if you
threw it on the ground nobody would
be likely to discover it

   i dont intend to throw it on the
ground i answered  look miss
meredith do you see that little brook
there 

  i pointed to a tiny stream which ran
past the rear of shady bower farm

   that stream must wend its way to
some creek or river around here i went
on excitedly  i was studying it this
morning luckily for us it has been
swollen by recent rains and small
though it is it ought to have enough
current to carry away a small bottle
i am going to put a message in a little
glass bottle and throw it into the brook
if we are iucky it will be carried out
into deeper water and finally to the river
and somebody will pick it up and hurry
to our rescue

   oh how very clever of you  she
exclaimed clapping her little hands
i do hope that you will succeed if
you get me out of this horrid place i
shall never forget you mr colling-
wood

  these words made me more than ever
determined not to fail

  i wrote on a piece of paper with my
fountain pen the following stirring mes-
sage 

  help help help whoever reads
  this get men and guns and hasten to
  shady bower farm meritville greene
  county we are kept prisoners here by

  farmer snookins who has gone insane
  there are nine of us and we have been
  imprisoned here for weeks dont fail
  to come well armed for farmer snook-
  ins is armed to the teeth and he has six
  savage boarhounds for heavens sake
  dont fail us in our hour of need or our
  blood will be on your head hurry
  llurry hurry help help help

    guess that is strong enough 
remarked eying my work with satisfac-
tion i rolled the paper tightly and
placed it inside a small bottle which had
contained tooth wash then i jammed
the cork in so snugly that the bottle was
thoroughly water-tight and threw it into
the brook

  miss janet meredith and i observed
with much satisfaction that there was
just enough current to the tiny stream to
carry the bottle away

  we watched that improvised bearer of
our forlorn hope until it drifted out of
sight then we both sighed and walked
slowly away

   i do hope that somebody finds it
and reads that message miss meredith
remarked fervently

  my emotion was too great to permit
of words i squeezed her little hand
sympathetically and noticed with de-
light that she did not appear to resent it

  all that day we wondered and wor-
ried every time our eyes met each
could see that that little bottle and its
precious contents were uppermost in the
others thoughts

  we said nothing to our fellow pris-
oners about what we had done of
course if my plan was successful we
would all benefit by it but there was
no use in taking them into our con-
fidence at present

  that evening farmer snookins sum-
moned us all into the barn

  there was something about his man-
ner which filled me with terror his
eyes were bloodshot and rolling his
mouth worked spasmodically liis coun-
tenance ordinarily sinister now looked
positively fiendish

  when we were all assembled before
him he stood there regarding us with a
leer of triumph rubbed his palms to-
gether in a satisfied way and gave vent
to several chuckles the sound of which
made my blood run cold

 a


the argosy

  i knew that something unusual was
about to happen but  did not guess
the awful fate that fiend in human form
had mapped out for us

  ladies and gentlemen he began
in a rasping voice  i have assembled
you here in order to give you a great
tyeat my asylum for the sane has been
an immense success i am very well
pleased with the way my original idea
has worked my experiment has given
me great pleasure but nevertheless i
have decided that it is time to bring it
to an end

  each of us heaved a heartfelt sigh
of relief we thought that he was about
to announce we could have our freedom

   i have decided to bring my experi-
ment to an end by a great and thrilling
spectacle he went on chuckling at the
hopeful look on our faces

    i once read in a book that in ancient
times slaves were thrown into the arena
along with wild beasts this barn will
make an excellent arena and those pet
dogs -of mine are certainly wild beasts
i havent given them a morsel of food
this day in order that their appetites
should be thoroughly whetted

  we understood him now and looked
at each other in horror and despair

   good heavens i gasped  you
dont mean to say that you are really
going to be inhuman enough to set those
dogs on us

  he laughed sardonically

    i reckon youve got my idea exactly
friend he chuckled  in three min-
utes i shall whistle for my faithful pets
and then the fun will begin

  he again rubbed the palms of his
hands together i looked into that cruel
face and foresaw that we were all
doomed but nevertheless i tried to
plead with him

   have mercy i begged  give us
a little more time or if you must kill
us shoot us down dont let those terri-
ble dogs tear us to pieces have a little

pity-

   no no he replied laughing loud
and shaking his head  it wouldnt be
half as much fun to shoot you down
ive thought of that but it would all be
over too quick the dogs will furnish
a much more thrilling spectacle its
going to be the dogs

    and the three minutes are up too
he added  the festive hour has ar-
rived slaves prepare to defend your-
selves if you can for here come the
wild beasts to devour you

   he pursed his lips and was about to
give vent to the whistle which meant
our doom

   but just then we heard wild howls of
fury followed by the sharp reports of
firearms and the shouting of many men

   before farmer snookins could turn a
burly man had entered the barn and
brought the stock of a rifle crashing
down upon his head

  the burly man was followed by sev-
eral others we turned to our deliverers
with exclamations of gratitude and joy

   thank goodness we were in time
said the burly man kneeling and tying
the prostrate farmers hands and feet
with ropes  i am the sheriff of the
county ladies and gentlemen the note
you sent in the bottle was picked up in
the creek by a feller in a naphtha launch
and handed to me

     didnt know whether it was a hoax
or not but i decided to act at once i
got my posse together and we came here
as quick as we could

    ive been sort of suspicious of this
feller snookins for some time past every
time ive met him on the road ive fan-
cied he looked and acted sort of queer

   he aint been exactly right i
guess since his wife and daughter were
drowned a year ago i didnt suppose
though that he was really violently in-
sane i figured out that he was harm-
less

    well he wasnt harmless i assure
you i declared grimly if you had
arrived one second later you would have
found our mangled bodies he was just
about to order those terrible dogs of his
to tear us limb from limb when you and
your men gallantly intervened by the
way what have you done with those
dogs

   shot em all dead he answered
with a grunt of satisfaction  thanks
to the warning contained in that bottle
we came here fully prepared to handle
them brutes they attacked us but we
were too quick for them each and
every one of them has a bullet through
his head
a cold day for the georgia man



  my breast expanded with a heartfelt
sigh of relief

   i guess you are all free to depart
now ladies and gentlemen whenever
you are ready announced the sheriff
with a pleasant smile  i reckon you
wont want to hang around shady bower
farm after the experience you have had
 i reckon not i replied  i am
awfully glad that my bottle plan worked
so well arent you miss meredith
but instead of answering my question

the beautiful girl suddenly reeled and
fell fainting into my arms

  of course it was an unconscious act
on her part but her hands were certainly
clasped around my neck when she opened
her eyes

   after all this harrowing experi-
ence possessed some compensating ad-
vantages i remarked to the sheriff

   so i perceive he replied with a
laugh  dont forget to send me an
invitation young feller

a cold day for the georgia man

                   by george mariano

                          not much trouble in getting this overcoat
                          at a bargain but lots of it afterward

anter good overcoat cheap as
dirt  

  walter babbit looked as though he
needed several things besides an over-
coat the store-clothes he had bought
before leaving simpson corners were de-
cidedly not of the smart cut worn by
the young men he saw in the places where
he applied for work then three weeks
tramping had caused their appearance to
deteriorate sadly

   his shoes had literally gone to pieces
 his derby hat had come to grief in a
 rush at a subway station and positively
 refusedto give up one or two dents

  but the one need that impressed itself
 most deeply upon him this cold evening
 was that of an overcoat all day he had
 wandered about searching for employ-
 ment and shivering the cheap meals
 had brought him to his last ten-dollar
 bill but had failed to warm him

   he was not used to new yorks de-
cember weather for simpson corners
is in georgia as any map big enough to
mark a village of four hundred inhabit-
ants will show you and december in
georgia is different from december in
new york

   for the past week walter babbit had
 eyed every window of the cheap tailor-
 shops he passed he had read every
 price-tag looking for one that should
 come inside the five-dollar mark

for lie had made up his mind that five

dollars was his limit for an overcoat he
had just seen one at four-ninety-five that
he would have turned up bis nose at a
week ago but to-day was colder than
any of the other days

  he was just about to enter the little
shop when the stranger accosted him
with the question that showed the men-
tal insight of a mind-reader

  babbit turned around and looked in
wonder at the possessor of such occult
powers

  the stranger was a short thick-set
young man about babbits own age he
wore a rather shabby outer garment with
its collar turned up at the neck his hat
was drawn over his eyes which were a
trifle shifty

  the lad from georgia could not help
feeling a bit suspicious but any propo-
sition offering a good overcoat cheap was
interesting

   come along and ill show you a real
bargain the man urged and babbit
started off with him

  they went through some side streets
and but for the fact that they were all
fairly well lighted the country youth
would have felt a little nervous he had
a sort of feeling that he was being led
by a very roundabout course to reach a
near-by place

  he was quite sure that he walked three
or four blocks north after going some
blocks south when at last they pulled


the argosy

up before an unpretentious apartment-
house babbit was uncomfortably admit-
ting to himself that he had lost his bear-
ings

  they climbed three or four flights of
stairs and the man finally paused and
produced a key from one of his pockets
with this he admitted himself and bab-
bit to a rear suite of rooms

  inside everything was a confusion of
unassorted objects several sets of fine
silver lay heaped upon the floor small
bits of bric-a-brac were scattered about
various pieces of womens wearing ap-
parel especially furs were piled in a
corner in another corner were a num-
ber of boxes of cigars

  against one wall was stacked a heap
of unbroken bolts of cloth arich piece
of tapestry had been thrown in another
corner three or four gold watches and
a couple of fancy little clocks gave out
the impression that time was carefully
measured here

  there was not a chair or table or any
other piece of furniture in the room
neither was there a window or door save
the one- by which they had entered wal-
ter babbit noted the strangeness of it all
and accepted the strangers explanation
that he had just moved into the flat and
had no time to put things in order

   heres the coat the man finally an-
nounced triumphantly after he had rum-
maged the pile of womens apparel
whatll you gimme for it

  babbit looked at the garment in amaze-
ment it was such a coat as he had never
hoped to possess

  its inner lining was of most beautiful
fur the outside was of a soft black
genteel-looking material the name of
which was beyond the southerners
knowledge of cloths

  sorrowfully he shook his head

   i couldnt even make an offer on a
coat like that he faltered

  the stranger fairly beamed upon the
splendid garment

   i know you couldnt young feller
that coat is worth about five hundred
dollars it wouldnt be for sale either
if-if my poor brother hadnt died las
week i aint got the heart to wear it
id give it to you if i wasnt so blamed
hard up come on make an offer

  babbit smiled deprecatingly

   ive only got ten dollars to my
name he ventured

   well the other replied  ill let
you have it fer that youre needin a
coat pretty bad an im glad of the
chanct to help yer

  the georgian was on the point of
giving up his last dollar for the splendid
bargain then he remembered that an
overcoat was not the only thing he
needed

  his room in the cheap boarding-house
was paid for three days more but his
meals were not included in that

  he had tried for two weeks to get work
and failed it might be two weeks more
before anything would show up no
he could not spare all his money

   i couldnt give the ten he sighed
im looking for work and i have to
keep something for my meals i dont
care to spend more than five dollars for
an overcoat just now

   make it seven-fifty and split the
diff the man haggled

  the bargain ended in babbits paying
six dollars for the coat he put it on
and slipped the change into a pocket

  the man generously offered to pilot
him back to the place he had come from
the southerner thanked him and said he
would prefer now to be put on his way
to his lodgings on eighth avenue

  he was led about by more side streets
before his benefactor informed him that
this was eighth avenue and that he was
but ten blocks from home then the
stranger with a curt  so long disap-
peared around a corner

  walter babbit had walked twenty or
thirty blocks in either direction on
eighth avenue in the course of his search
for a room and later in his less success-
ful hunt for employment he thought
he was fairly familiar with certain land-
marks and he felt quite sure now that
those landmarks were wanting

  he glanced at the gilt number on the
nearest door it was  the number
of his lodging-house was 

  he walked south half a block to the
corner and glanced up to see the number
of the street it was fifty-seventh his
room was near the corner of twelfth
then he noticed the name of the street
upon which he was walking it was
madison avenue
a cold day for the georgia man



  he walked another block and read the
next sign he was still on madison
avenue

   this is queer he muttered  i
suppose that fellow thought it was a joke
to put a green man so far out of his way
oh well im not so cold but what i can
stand a good walk now

  the streets through which he had
passed with the stranger had been quite
deserted as babbit walked along the
more crowded avenue he became aware
that people were looking at him curi-
ously it dawned upon him that the
overcoat was just a trifle out of keeping
with the rest of his garments

   wonder what they think i am he
thought without worrying particularly

  the warmth was so welcome that the
mere matter of peoples opinion did not
weigh with him

  hardly had he thought out this ques-
tion when it was answered by one of a
gay crowd of young people who crossed
the avenue directly in front of him one
of them pointed him out and exclaimed
pipe mine new  ofercoadt jakey in
mocking tones

   wonder where he stole it  put in a
feminine voice

  it was fortunate that the voice was
feminine babbits hot southern blood
went to his forehead in a way that would
have been dangerous for any man who
had thus spoken

  but as the late purchaser of the over-
coat walked on and his wrath cooled a
lot of his satisfaction over his bargain
waned the suggestion that he had
stolen the garment reminded him of
thieves in general somehow this con-
nected in his mind with the strange room
in which he had made his purchase

  suddenly he stopped in the middle of
a well-lighted block and exclaimed  by
george ill wager it was a stolen coat 

  he stood there wondering what he
should do for his life he could not re-
trace his steps to the unpretentious apart-
ment-house he had no more idea where
it was than he would have had if the
house had been located on the moon

  his perturbation was increased as three
or four more passers-by stared at his in-
congruous combination of raiment

  he started again on his way without
any elasticity in his step his gait was

slow he suddenly felt very tired and
hungry he stopped once more and
looked longingly inside the windows of
an almost empty restaurant he was pass-
ing

  a man at the table nearest the window
suddenly glanced up there was a mo-
mentary look of compassion in his eye
then a slight smile of amusement which
in turn gave place to marked astonish-
ment mingled with wrath the man in-
terested babbit almost as much as babbit
seemed to interest him

  for an instant he seemed to be puz-
zling out some line of action then
slowly and easily he arose from the table
handed a bill to the waiter who hurried
forward with a rather unusually light
overcoat for the season and came out

  babbit was sufficiently interested in
him to notice that he eyed the overcoat
very keenly as he passed and that his
steps quickened after he had walked a
dozen paces

  he had just turned from staring after
this stranger when a rather flashily
dressed youth made a sudden dash at
him from the opposite side of the street

   come here you this young man
snapped indignantly  what in the
devil are you doing with my overcoat  

  again the angry flush came to babbits
face but he did not splutter or offer
fight

   this is not your overcoat i just
bought it he tried to say calmly

   you did did you ill see about that
when a policeman comes along here
let me have a look at the inside pocket

  babbit felt a sudden freezing around
his heart without a murmur he opened
the coat and let the young man examine
the white cloth sewed inside the pocket

   now the other sneered triumphant-
ly  perhaps you can explain why your
tailor has put my name on this tag 

  babbit looked in terror at the indelible
writing james b moore was very
distinct more writing followed pre-
sumably an address

   well young fellow i wont give you
up to the police you look as though
you were up against it enough to be
strongly tempted just let me have my
coat and ill keep mum

  the flashily dressed youth led the way
toward a partially shadowed spot at the


the argosy

foot of an imposing front stoop the
southerner felt grateful for this it
was less humiliating to have to give up
his finery where the light was not so
glaring he even murmured  thank
you as the young man walked away
with the garment drawn over the one he
already wore

  then as he still stood and tried to
grasp the situation it dawned upon him
that he had put his last four dollars in the
inside pocket of that overcoat he start-
ed to run after the young man who had
been so generous as not to prosecute him
he did not run far

   thats the man  an excited voice
exclaimed as a big policeman grabbed
babbits wrist  but hes-hes taken
off my coat

   whered you put it the officer
growled giving the wrist a wrench that
caused all its owners fingers to ache

  babbit was so astonished that he could
not speak for a few seconds his jaw
dropped and refused to close for the
enunciation of words

   come on now-be quick wheres
that coat the officer emphasized the
question with another twist of the wrist
that brought a groan from babbits lips
it also brought back his power of speech

   why-why he stammered  i gave
it back to mr moore

  the excited man whom babbit now
recognized as the one who had showed so
much interest from the window of the
restaurant looked angrier and more ex-
cited than ever the policeman nearly
broke the southerners arm

   none of that bo he cried  you
tell us quick where your pal went with
that coat or well know why

   i-i dont know where he went i-
i was just starting after him

   well how in tophet could you start
after him if you dont know where he
went the policeman sneered

   he went that way and babbit
pointed  i dont know where

   humph   grunted the officer  well
just take him to the station mr moore
i guess well get somethin outer him
there will you come along to make the
charge 

 i certainly will the man replied
with another wrench on the wrist the
officer slipped a shining band over that

bruised member babbit was too fright-
ened to talk only one idea seemed to
possess his mind he was being ar-
rested-taken to jail like a thief he was
accused of robbery and he did not see
how he could ever prove that he was not
guilty

  and this was the end of the fortune
he had expected to make in the countrys
metropolis

  his meditation ended as he was jerked
up before the sergeants desk in the po-
lice-station

   got this one almost with the goods
on the policeman announced as he sa-
luted his superior  its one of the gang
that has been workin harlem this
here gentleman saw him standin in front
of the st jarvis with his overcoat on

it was taken three nights ago

  wheres the coat the sergeant in-
quired

   thats where the young devil got the
best of us he shifted it to a pal while
mr moore came after me

   humph  and the sergeant looked
puzzled he had once been on the
plain-clothes service and had an interest
in details  looks as though hed been
expecting to get caught are you sure
mr moore this is the man you saw  
sure of course im sure why
if i didnt remember his face i couldnt
help noticing that hat when it was 
top of a two-hundred-dollar overcoat

  mr moore was honestly indignant 
that his identification should be ques-
tioned

   well lets have your pedigree you
young rascal whats your name

   walter babbit the southerner an-
swered in choking tones

  he wished he could think of some
other name wherewith to keep his own
family from the disgrace but he couldnt
do so on the spur of the moment

   age

   twenty-two

  where do you live

   simpson corners georgia babbit
began  then corrected himself  that
is i lived there till i came here to look
for a position

   what kind of position were you
looking for the sergeant grinned

   i studied bookkeeping at the atlanta
business college
a cold day for the georgia man	

   ah  and the sergeant smiled still
more  looking for a position of trust
in some bank or business house  

  babbit mistook the significance of the
smile and answered  yes sir

   and thought you would practise on
a few second-story windows till you
could get at a safe easily 

   wh-what 

   oh cut out this bluffing the offi-
cial growled impatiently  if you want
to tell now where your pals are all
right if not well get that out of you
later

   i dont know where i got the coat
im not familiar enough with the city
i couldnt tell where they took me
babbit pleaded

   take him to the pen ill be in
there in a minute the sergeant nod-
ded significantly and the policeman
who had arrested him started to obey

   wait a moment sergeant

  it was the complainant who now in-
terrupted he had seemed to be inter-
ested in babbits face from the moment
they had entered the room

   i dont like to go without hearing
the fellows story before i make the com-
plaint he added

   well come on with your yarn
make it short the sergeant snapped at
babbit

  that young man then began and re-
hearsed the whole course of events since
he had been offered a bargain in over-
coats that evening in fact he went
further back under the inspiration of
questions from mr moore and the ser-
geant and told something of his hard-
ships in town since his arrival

  but where was this house the
sergeant asked again as babbit finished

   i dont know where they took me
i havent the slightest idea

   you see mr moore its  use its
hardly likely that he could be taken to a
house and brought back without knowing
where he went new york is a little
better laid out than that wtell get
more out of him between now and morn-
ing

  the man behind the desk saw that his
words were taking good effect

   ill be around to make the charge
mr moore promised

  the clang of the patrol-wagon sound-

ed outside and there was a hurried
scuffling of feet at the door

   take him in the sergeant com-
manded eager to get the one case out of
the way before the newcomers should be
presented

  he lowered his eyes to the blotter as
babbit was being led to the pen the
crowd from a gambling-house raid were
being led iiito the room

  just one moment the official
called after babbit and his leader
 where did you say is your present
residence 

  the prisoner turned about to reply
as he swung around his eyes passed
over the bunch of  material witnesses 
the raiders had secured from the gam-
bling-den

  then his mouth opened in wonder
he forgot to reply to the question that
had been asked in the group was a
young man  whose rich fur-lined over-
coat was opened to reveal the flashy
clothes within

   thats the man  gave the coat to 
babbit exclaimed

   that looks like my coat mr moore
seconded

  the youth made a quick dodge to get
away being arrested as a witness
against a gambling-house was not seri-
ous he had not minded that but the
overcoat proposition was different

  he was stopped however by a quick
policeman at the door of the station-
house

   well say slick jim i guess you
overstepped the mark getting that coat
back again the sergeant snapped at the
new prisoner  perhaps you can help
clear up this mystery 

  slick jim helped mr moore soon
had his overcoat once more the search
of its pockets however failed to reveal
the four dollars of walter babbit

  lost them on the wheel slick jim
admitted boldly

  babbit realized that he must go out
once more into the cold coatless-and
this time penniless as well he almost
wished for the warm shelter of the sta-
tion-house rather than the journey to
lower eighth avenue

  just a moment mr babbit mr
moore stopped him at the outer door of
the station   had offered twenty-five


the argosy

dollars reward for the recovery of that
coat i didnt mention it inside for fear
the policeman would claim it

  he held out two yellow bills and one
green one then he paused as though
about to say something more

   look here young man he began
again  have you got any letters of
reference from - say the business col-
lege in atlanta i rather like your face
if that isnt too much to say to it

  for the first time in three weeks bab-
bit took his letter from the head of the
atlanta business college out of its en-
velope before being told that the person
he wanted to show it to had not time to
read it

  it was a good letter he had felt
that it would be sure to land him some-
where it showed that he had held the
highest marks in all classes throughout
the course of study

  mr moore read it through silently
and handed it back he looked babbit
over with a look of disapproval in his
eyes

   pretty hard on clothes arent you
he asked

  babbit felt his heart sinking and stam-
mered  yes sir like a schoolboy
caught in some glaring and interdicted
naughtiness

   still  guess i want you here ill
give you a weeks salary in advance i
know i can trust you but i couldnt
have any one in mv office who didnt
look a bit better dressed than you do
and heres my place of business please
be there at eight-thirty to-morrow morn-
ing get yourself some new clothes in
the meanwhile good night and avoid
further trouble

  and before the astonished young man
could more than say thank you mr-
moore- was sprinting after an up-town
car

  babbit looked through half - tearful
eyes at two more yellow bills and one
more green one then he hunted for a
shop where he could buy a less expen-
sive overcoat at not quite so good a bar-
gain

         the hero

 what makes a hero-not success not fame

 inebriate merchants and the loud acclaim
 of glutted avarice-caps tossed up in air

 or pen of journalist with flourish fair

 bells pealed stars ribbons and a titular name-

 these though his rightful tribute he can spare

 his rightful tribute not his end or aim

 or true reward for never yet did these
 refresh the soul or set the heart at ease

 what makes a hero an heroic mind

 expressed in action in endurance proved

 and if there be preeminence of right

 derived through pain well suffered to the height
 of rank heroic tis to bear unmoved

 not toil not risk not rage of sea or wind

 not the brute fury of barbarians blind

 but worse-ingratitude and poisonous darts

 launched by the country he has served and loved

 this with a free unclouded spirit pure

 this in the strength of silence to endure

 a dignity to noble deeds imparts
 beyond the gauds and trappings of renown

 this is the heros complement and crown

 this missed one struggle has been wanting still

 one glorious triumph of the heroic will

 one self-approval in his heart of hearts

a hand-bag too many

                     by robert keene

                  wherein is set forth the awful predicament of a good
                  lady with a bad memory in the shopping district

t beg your pardon madam - you
 dropped your bag 

  miss hutchison turned in the nar-
row crowded aisle of the department-
storc facing her stood an alert-eyed
young man hat in hand holding out to
her a plain black-leather shopping-case

   dear me  exclaimed the little
white-haired lady staring at the famil-
iar-appearing chatelaine he proffered
 why raising her empty hands and
clapping them hastily to her belt-
 why so i did 

  the young man pressed the bag into
her clasp

   i picked it up from the floor behind
you he explained briefly turning away
 not at all he called over his shoulder
in answer to her half-uttered speech of
thanks youre quite welcome 

  then stepping back into the crowd
around them he wheeled down another
aisle and disappeared

  well miss hutchison stood
flusteredlv looking after his departing
figure her eyes dropped to the shop-
ping-case in her hands  well im
very fortunate im sure to get back my
bag

   and very stupid she added  to
drop it

  lifting her gaze to glance swiftly
about her she thankfully perceived that
no one watched the embarrassment she
felt at the exposure of her carelessness

  no one-that is save a heavily mus-
tached man in a brown derby hat stand-
ing beside the opposite counter he
turned at the moment that she looked in
his direction his eyes sweeping her from
head to foot in a slow stare and then
walked indifferently away

  blushing slightly miss hutchison
moved forward with the stream of shop-
pers flowing down the aisle

    cant understand my carelessness
in dropping that bag she told herself

 if it werent for that young mans
honesty i might have lost it and sup-
pose i had

  she trembled at the thought

  in the bag was more than two thou-
sand dollars-a sum withdrawn from
her bank not two hours before with
which to purchase letters of credit-and
the steamer tickets for herself and niece
who were to sail for a summer in europe
the next day

  suppose she losttthose tickets and all
that money the vision of the calamity
that would follow caused her to catch
her breath

  and she had nearly done it she had
escaped such ill fortune by a hair-
breadth

  however she thought gratefully her
grasp on the bag in her hand tightening
she had avoided the catastrophe

  arrived anthe end of the aisle miss
hutchison stepped out into the rotunda
and a glance at the clock hung in the
dome brought an ejaculation of surprise
to her lips

  it was noon and she had arranged
to meet marion her niece not later than
half after eleven she was nearly half
an hour late she realized as she turned
hastily up another aisle

  an hour before marion and she had
parted on the second floor of the store
promising to meet again at the glove
counter miss hutchison arriving there
fifteen minutes ahead of time had
whiled away a few tedious moments in
the selection of a pair of suedes and de-
parted

  she intended returning promptly but
the minutes had slipped by uncounted in
her aimless wandering about the store
and now she was late

  how foolish she had been to leave the
counter in the first place marion ar-
riving to find her gone might go off in
search of her thus they both would be


the argosy

lost in vain seeking of each other
through the crowded store

  still she was only tyenty minutes
late her niece would wait for her yet
she thought worriedly she should not
have parted from the girl at all

  there was marions troublesome love-
affair miss hutchison remembered with
a catch of her breath

  when the niece had confessed to her
love for tom somebody-or-other her
aunt did not know who nor what he
was she had put her foot emphatically
down upon the match

   you are too young - entirely too
young  was her one objection-the un-
alterable answer to her nieces every
argument

  she refused to see the girls lover
turned a deaf ear to all praise of his
good qualities and at last driven to
desperation was preparing to carry
marion off with her to europe

   shes a dear the girl informed tom
clinton who raved vainly over the im-
possibility of the situation  and i know
shed agree with me that youre one too
if shed only agree to see you rut she
wont

   im all she has to love ii the world
tom and she hates to lose me-yet in
a year or so im sure shell change her
mind but until then well just have
to wait and remember she thinks shes
doing the best thing for me shes really
a darling

  the  darling  now turned down the
aisle containing the glove department
the passageway between the two counters
was comparatively deserted her swift
glance down its length unobstructed
and marion was not there

  her worst fears were realized they
had missed each other

  she would ask the salesgirl if any one
answering to her neices description had
been there miss hutchison stepped
hastily forward

  she was within two yards of the coun-
ter and breathlessly hurrying on-when
she stopped short with a startled gasp

  lying beside a pile of boxes on the
counter was a plain black-leather shop-
ping-case-her bag

  with widened eyes she stared at the
chatelaine there could be no doubt
about it it was her own

  even at that distance she could see
plainly a long scratch on its upturned
side-a mark she remembered accidental-
ly to have been made some time before
with a hat-pin

  she readily understood how the bag
came on the counter she had carelessly
left it behind when she went away from
the department a half-hour ago

  but-she raised the black-leather case
she held in her hands-but if the bag on
the counter was hers to whom did the
one she carried belong

  the young man who gave it to her told
her that he had picked it up behind her
on the floor she did not have her own
bag with her therefore he had thought
the case hers since she alone probably
of all the women about him was empty-
handed

  and her mistake in taking the strange
chatelaine was no less simple than his
error in giving it to her the case in
her hands was the exact duplicate in
point of size and general appearance of
her own-of a thousand others in daily
use without the scratch upon her bag
she could not have told the difference be-
tween the two even if they were placed
side by side before her

  here she had been carrying around a
strange shopping-case under the impres-
sion that it was her own-congratulating
herself upon the recovery of her bag-
and all the time her precious chatelaine
the receptacle of her money and the
steamer tickets was lost

  for over half an hour that unpreten-
tious-appearing shopping-case had been
lying in plain view on the counter and
in it was over two thousand dollars in
bills-to say nothing of the six hundred
dollars worth of tickets as well

  surely good fortune followed in her
footsteps to-day she had thought herself
lucky when the bag she imagined to be
her own was returned to her now she
was really fortunate in actually recover-
ing her property

  miss hutchison stepped quickly to the
counter

   i left my bag here a few minutes
ago she said to the saleswoman  that
is it reaching out her hand to the case
before her

   i beg your pardon replied the girl
picking up the bag and laying it down
a hand-bag too many



on the ledge of jhe shelf behind her
 this belongs to some one else

   some one else  miss hutchison ex-
claimed  im sure youre wrong-the
bag belongs to me 

  the girl watched her with a smile upon
her lips

   do you think you lost your bag
madam  she asked slowly

   certainly i dont think it  the little
lady answered a trifle sharply  i know
i lost it the bag youve just picked up
is mine

  the smile deepened  the salesgirls
face she leaned confidentially over the
counter

   youve made a mistake she said in
an amused tone  your bag isnt lost-
youre carrying it in your hands right
now 

  miss hutchison gasped and lifting
the bag she held stared from it to the
young womans smiling face

   youre mistaken she replied quick-
ly  this bag isnt mine-i dont know
whose it is but the one behind you be-
longs to me

   youre sure you havent made some
mistake the girls voice was kind
as though she was speaking to an un-
reasonable child  surely you wouldnt
be carrying somebody elses bag instead
of your own

  miss hutchison sat down  the stool
before the counter the situation was
aggravating in the extreme here she was
within sight of her bag and its precious
contents but she couldnt get it because
this stupid girl thought the bag she held
in her hands was her own oh it was
maddening

   you wouldnt be carrying two bags
would you  the young woman was say-
ing

  collecting her scattered wits the little
lady leaned forward and impressively
addressed her

   listen she began  a young man
picked this bag up from the floor behind
me  the other side of the store and
gave it to me i had left my bag-the
one behind you-here  this counter
where i bought a pair of gloves not more
than half an hour ago

   of course the man thought the chat-
elaine was mine i was near it and did
not carry a bag as probably every other

woman around him did i took the bag
thinking it was mine when i discovered
that the one i owned was gone-you can
see for yourself how much alike the two
are

   that young man and i both made a
mistake youre making one too by
holding back my property now wont
you please return my bag to me 

  the girl looked at her in silence the
smile had left her lips and she considered
the older woman quite gravely

   well you see she said slowly at
length  its very peculiar you know-
you having a bag in your hands and then
coming to claim this one i dont want
to make any mistake

   but thats just what you are doing 
miss hutchison cried earnestly  i tell
you that bag behind you on the shelf is
mine 

   well hesitated the girl  you see 
dont know maggie-shes the girl
that waited on you i guess-she told me
that somebodyd left her bag here and
to give it to the party when she called
but she didnt say anything about the
person who left it having two bags and
i dont-

   where is the other girl-the one who
waited on me 

   maggie shes gone home you
see-

   when will she return  miss hutch-
ison impatiently interrupted again  she
can identify me and give me back my
bag

   she wont be back calmly an-
nounced the other  she went home
sick and she wont be here till to-morrow
morning

  the little lady received the informa-
tion in stunned silence this girl would
not surrender her bag because she did
not know her the salesgirl who could
identify her was not there how was
she to secure her property then

  this is most annoying she ex-
claimed at last  i dont know what i
can do to convince you that the bag you
are keeping from me is really mine

  the girl pondered the situation for a
moment

   well maam she said finally  you
understand im willing to give you your
bag if i know its yours but i dont
want to get into any trouble over it if


the argosy

i turned it over to you and somebody
came along after youd gone and  found
you hadnt-well-

   i can tell you everything thats in
it cried the other suddenly struck with
the idea  just hold the bag down under
the counter where i cant see it and ill
identify everything it contains

  the girl smiled again this time pity-
ingly

  no maam she grinned  thats
too easy suppose the bag belonged to
somebody you knew and youd seen
whatever was in it-you could tell me
all right we girls that need our jobs
have got to be awful careful or well get
fired you see

  miss hutchisons teeth closed with ail
angry snap the situation was intoler-
able-and there seemed no way out of
it

  why had that young man ever handed
her the hateful bag she carried if he
hadnt troubled to return to her what was
not hers she would not be in her present
difficulty

  and why hadnt she been more care-
ful in accepting it why hadnt she
kept her wits about her and examined
the bag before she took it

  suddenly she sat erect upon the stool
into her mind had flashed a sudden hor-
rifying thought

  it had not occurred to her before but
-had that young man really picked up
the bag as he said he did

  suppose-she shuddered at the possi-
bility-suppose he had lied suppose
the bag was his and he had wished to be
rid of it

  why should he wish that because
lie did not want to be seen carrying the
case

  perhaps the young man was a shop-
lifter

  she had read stories of the desperate
means taken to avoid capture by this
order of criminals

  this might be one of those stories hap-
pening in real life the young man if
he was a shoplifter with a bag full of
loot might have been pursued through
the store

  the first thing he would do would be
to try to get rid of the incriminating evi-
dence of his guilt

  and what more natural means of doing

so could he devise than to hand the bag
over to the first woman he saw without
a shopping-case explain thai he had
picked the bag up near her on the floor
trust to luck that she might indeed have
dropped hers and substitute his booty-
sack for her property

  had that happened to her miss
hutchison felt a cold perspiration break
out on her body

  she remembered the young mans man-
ner when he had given her the bag she
held she recalled that he had hurried
off immediately after she took the case
from him

  was he a thief had he made her a
party to his crime by turning over to her
the stolen goods to escape detection

  what was in the bag he had given
her if she had looked into it in the
first place she would have avoided the
mistake she had made and if the case
contained stolen property when she re-
ceived it that property was still there

  there was just oue way to find out
with a swift turn of her wrist she opened
the bag she held on her knees as she sat
on the low stool before the counter

  dropping her eyes she shot a swift
glance within then with a half-
smothered cry she snapped the clasp
hastily shut and looked fearsomely about
her

  the chatelaine was crammed-literal-
ly stuffed to bursting with a disordered
mass of expensive laces gold watches
odd bits of jewelry an embroidered scarf
or two-a jumble which fairly shrieked
its identity to be  loot

  oh where was marion the little lady
thought agonizedly she needed her
needed some one near her to bolster her
waning courage

  she cast a second nervous glance
around her at the realization that no
one had seen the inside of the case she
drew a deep sigh of relief and sharply
caught her breath

  her eyes met those of a familiar face
at the corner of the aisle ten yards dis-
tant on her left

  the same thickly-mustached man in
the brown derby hat who had stared at
her after she received the strange bag
was now watching her

  his eyes seemed to bore two holes into
her head with the intensity of his gaze
a hand-bag too many



miss hutchison felt the color rushing
into her cheeks as she turned away her
timid glance

  who was that man he frightened
her her eyes dropped again to the
shopping-case in her lap did he know
what was in it she wondered nervously

  she must get rid of the bag the
danger of its contents being discovered
and found in her possession was too great

  forgotten was her previous distress at
her failure to recover her own chatelaine
in the new anxiety to be rid of the other

  but how was she to do away with the
bag of stolen goods

  the burden of the problem was too
much for her to bear unaided if marion
would only come she thought worriedly
they two could devise some means out of
the difficulty

   say broke in the voice of the sales-
woman watching her troubled face from
behind the counter  im awful sorry
about that bag honestly i am i dont
know but what it does belong to you
and-well-oh gee i wisht i knew
what to do about it 

  miss hutchison looked up at the girl
her lip trembling at the sympathy in her
voice

  the young woman had a kind face
perhaps she could help her if she told
her what was in the bag she held pos-
sibly the girl could advise her how best
to dispose of it

  suddenly she determined to throw
herself upon the shopwomans mercies
she brought the leather case up from
her lap and laid it down on the counter

  her fingers twisted -tremblingly at the
clasp the bag slipped half-open-and a
hand gripped her lightly on the shoul-
der

  the tiny little lady turned with a nerv-
ous little cry-to look up into the heavily
mustached face of the man in the brown
derby

   dont open that bag lady  the man
said in a low grim voice  not unless
you want to get yourself pinched before
the whole store 

  miss hutchison stared wildly into his
lowered face his first words confirmed
her suspicions as to the consequences of
the discovery of the shoplifters bag in
her possession this man then knew
what was in it

  i -  dont understand you  she
said weakly who-who are you
im the store-detective - see the
man explained in a hoarse whisper  im
onto what you got in that grip see
now you want to keep quiet and not
make no fuss or youll have me snap the
bracelets onto you right out here in
front of everybody see 

   b-bracelets   miss hutchison stut-
tered between her chattering teeth
 vv-what d-do you m-mean

   handcuffs - darbies - manacles is
what i mean-see  he whispered fierce-
ly  now you want to keep quiet and
come along with me without no trouble
she was arrested oh this was ter-
rible terrible if marion would only
come

   b-but she stammered her eyes
pleadingly searching the face of the man
bending over her- but you-you are
making a mistake i am not what you
think me to be-truly i can explain-
 no you wont  the other interrupt-
ed in a hard undertone  theres noth-
in to explain youre caught with the
goods and youll have to come along with
me

   w-where are you going to take me 
the little lady asked helplessly

   ill take you to the managers office
hed like to see a slick shoplifter like
you well search you there

  search me miss hutchison rose
tremblingly to her feet  oh you cant
-you wont do that please-

  she broke off abruptly as her eyes
raised to the mans face swept down the
aisle behind him

  marion was advancing toward her
down the passageway

  at last now she would not be alone
in her trouble her niece would help her

   marion   she called to the approach-
ing girl  mar-

  her voice died in her throat the girl
was not alone-with her was a man a
young man-

  it was the young man who had given
her the bag of stolen goods

  she turned swiftly to the fellow with
the mustache standing beside her

  there she cried excitedly point-
ing to the advancing couple  there is
the person whom you want - there is
your shoplifter 


the argosy

  the man in the brown derby turned
swiftly his jaw hardened as he caught
sight of the alert-eyed young man com-
ing up the aisle

   why auntie  exclaimed marion
whatever is the matter what has
happened  

  marion miss hutchison gasped
the question  what are you doing
with that-that man

   oh its tom-tom clinton   the
girl answered hastily  let me intro-
duce you tom this is-

   stop  the little lady checked her
then aquiver with indignation she
stepped forward anti faced the young
man

   so you are the man who dares to
love my niece  and she addressed him
in a voice which trembled with anger
 you-a common thief a-

   why aunt  marion broke in
amazedly

   stop  her aunt interrupted her
 marion you have been deceived in this
man he is a thief-a criminal

   there is some mistake here im
positive and the young man addressed
the indignant flashing-eyed lady before
him  you surely do not mean-
you surely do not mean to deny
that you gave me this bag do you  his
accuser cried fiercely

  i gave it to you yes  the other an-
swered surprisedly  but-

   that will do miss hutchison broke
in  you gave me this bagful of
stolen lace and jewelry and other things
you hear that  and she turned excited-
ly to the black-mustached man who now
stood behind her  he admits that he
gave the bag to me-he is the one you
can take before your manager and
search show him this  slick  shop-
lifter  

   will you let me explain- mar-
ions companion began

  explain scornfully demanded
miss hutchison  explain-what have
you to explain

   marion as she turned to her niece
standing in wide-eyed astonishment be-
side her  this-this man came up to me
in this store half an hour ago and gave
me this bag he told me he picked it
up from the floor near me-i had left
my own bag here on this counter and so

took this case to be mine-and then lie
hurried off

   inside the bag is a mass of stolen
property this man was probably pur-
sued through the store wished to get rid
of his loot and so turned it over to me
you see-

  wait the young man stepped
determinedly forward  you must let
me explain i gave you this bag just
as you said i did telling you that i had
picked it up from the floor behind you
that is true i found the bag and gave
it to you because you were the nearest
woman to it without a bag of some sort
and i thought it belonged to you but
i did not know what was in it  never
saw it before  picked it up-it was
not mine 

  miss hutchison stared at him speech-
lessly his story was plausible there
was no reason why it could not be true
and he was the man her niece loved
marion surely would know if he were a
criminal

  perhaps she had made a mistake in
accusing him but-

   but if you are not guilty she
stammered faintly  who is the shoplift-
er to whom this bag belongs 

  the man in the brown derby cleared
his throat and stepped out from behind
the little lady

  now dont make a fuss about this
right out in the open he cautioned the
three you dont want to rouse the
whole store do you  

  they looked at him in silence

   im the house-detective the man
explained to the girl and her fiance
 we can arrange this thing if youll
keep quiet so there wont be any scandal
in which the old lady -nodding at miss
hutchison-is mixed up just keep
cool now and ill fix this thing

   but who is the thief to whom this
bag belongs the little lady asked
worriedly  until he is found i shall
be under suspicion because i have the
stolen goods

   i dont know who he is replied
marions friend  but im going to see
if i cant find him

  he turned away as he passed marion
he whispered in her ear

   this is my chance your aunt is in
trouble and if i can get her out of it
a hand-bag too many



im certain her objection to our engage-
ment will end ive got a clue that ill
follow up in the next five minutes and
report on right away wait for me

  he walked hurriedly down the aisle
the man in the brown derby looked
after him sharply and then stepping to
the counter beside them beckoned miss
hutchison and her niece to draw near

   nowr he said in a confidential un-
dertone  heres what ill do you turn
over that bag to me ill report the goods
in it to the office and let you get away

   of course i could pinch you and
make a lot of trouble that you wouldnt
like to have happen but ilpkeep my
eyes shut so to speak this time and let
you go

  he turned to marion and winked
knowingly toward her aunt

   i can see the old lady aint a pro-
fessional crook i understand whats the
matter with her he wagged his head
shrewdly  kleptomaniacs cant help
their habits-she aint to blame

   but  miss hutchison gasped ama-
zedly you-

   say the shopgirl behind the counter
interrupted  ive changed my mind
about givin you that bag of yours

  she cast a scornful glance at the mus-
tached man

   i dont believe youre a shoplifter
nor a  klep neither she announced

  with a determined gesture she hand-
ed the little lady her precious satchel
 there you are madam she said glow-
ering again at the man beside them
 those fly cops think they know it all
she sniffed contemptuously  but they
dont

  the little lady hurriedly opened the
bag and the eyes of the brown-derbied
man at her side glistened as he caught
sight of the roll of bills within

   now lets get down to business
he whispered hastily  you give me
that bag and-and a hundred dollars out
of that roll and ill let you go

  miss hutchison looked uncertainly at
her niece should she do as the man
asked-pay a bribe to save herself from
the consequences of a crime she had not
committed the two women stared
helplessly at each other

   quick  hissed the low voice at
their side turn over that bag and the

money and ill beat it if you dont
ill take you both to the managers of-
fice have you searched-both of you
mind-and then take you to jail which
is it 

  the little lady glanced questioningly
again at marion

   do as he says aunt whispered her
niece  you must save yourself from
this dreadful predicament

  miss hutchison looked timidly at the
man bending over her shoulder

   you understand she said slowly
 that i am innocent of any wrong-do-
ing-

   i only understand that im taking
graft and runnin the danger of gettin
fired out of my job he answerd quick-
ly  come on now hand over that bag
and a hundred dollars

  the little lady detached a bill from
the bundle in her bag and slipped it
with the shoplifters chatelaine into his
hands almost before they realized it
so swift was his departure the man was
gone

   well the little lady sighed wearily
 thats over with now ive got rid of
that hateful case of stolen property and
i have my own bag again i suppose
im very fortunate to get out of all this
annoyance as easily as i have

   that horrid man  marion ex-
claimed angrily  to think that he
would accuse you of being a-a thief
i hope he does lose his wretched job for
treating you as he did-and then making
you pay him for it 

  miss hutchison rose

   im lucky i guess to escape any-
thing worse she said  come dear
well go now

   oh wait  the girl cried in some
embarrassment tom - mr clinton
promised to be back and asked me to
wait for him

   marion began her aunt sharply
 we will not stay-

   look-auntie  her niece interrupt-
ed staring behind the little lady

  miss hutchison turned quickly
coming toward them down the aisle
was a group of men led by tom clinton
in whose footsteps followed the fellow
in the brown derby his arms linked in
those of two strangers

   heres your shoplifter miss hutchi-


th e argosy

son mr clinton announced as the
party halted at her side  this man who
told us he was the house-detective here
is the thief himself

   i suspected that all wasnt well he
continued  the way the man kept
cautioning us to be quiet struck me as a
little odd it seemed that he was more
anxious than we were to avoid notoriety

   so i went at once to the manager of
the store asked him for a description of
the detective and was immediately intro-
duced to this gentleman -he bowed to
one of the two men between whom the
thief stood- as none other than the
genuine special officer

   i explained the situation to the man-
ager he nodded to the second of the
two men holding the shoplifter- and
we three started to the scene at once

   on the way we met this crook just
getting ready to leave the store collared
him and he has confessed he turned
to the black-mustached man

   tell your story to the ladies as you
told it to us he ordered

   why there aint nothin to tell i
guess they dont already know the man
answered with a wry smile  somebody
knocked the bag out of my hand and i
saw this young feller pick it up and give
it to the old lady then i followed her
tryin to get it back some way

   i seen her open it up here at this
counter so  went up and pretended to
be a detective that was goin to arrest
her-threw a scare into her sos shed
give up the bag

   then i seen the wad of bills she
liad and  thought  could carry the
game further and get some cash out of
her on the bluff if i hadnt done that
he ended ruefully  id have got away
hanging around to get that money was
what gave these men a chance to get me
before i got off

  miss hutchison looked from the thief
to the young man standing at her nieces
side f-ft came forward and returned to
her the money she had given the psuedo-
detective

  e thank you she said

   he wasnt such a bad sort of a fel-
low after all she thought as she care-
fully surveyed him  he was quite
clever too to foil that mans game
perhaps-

  marion watching the softened expres-
sion upon her aunts face advanced to
tom clinton and linked her arm in his

   dont you think auntie-  she be-
gan shyly

  miss hutchison instantly burned her
bridges

   i think she said firmly  that wed
better go to lunch-all three of us 

a summer song

 though the days of summer are lighter
 in the breath of perfume and flowers
 and the skies are cloudless and brighter
 than ever were ours

 though the flush of the streams onftowing
 may murmur a wood-noted song

 and the wild-hearted daisy is growing
 the woodside along

 yet the sullen sad silence of winter
 may keep with the trend of the heart
 and meetings come only to glint a
 rare moment and part

 for rather the somber clouds starting
 than ever the skies lightest hue

 if lightness comes but with the parting
         from you

sections which are withdrawn one after the other from
the finished regal shoe-first part a then

other
ready-to-wear
shoes are built on
old-style solid wooden
lasts and must therefore be
made large at the waist to allow
the broadest part of the last to be with-
drawn this explains their tendency to wrinkle
over the instep and under the arch and to let the
foot slide forward and crowd against the toe of the shoe
remember that only in regal shoes can you get the small
snug custom instep made possible by the regalorm last-
