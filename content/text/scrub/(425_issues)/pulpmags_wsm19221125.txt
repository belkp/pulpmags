titont thing too    when he first

m came here he was just an ordinary worker

   i for a time when things were slack i even
 thought that we might have to let him go

   then gradually i noticed an improvement in
 his work he seemed to really
 understand what he was doing

   one day he came into my office
 and said he had worked out a new
 arm for the automatic feeder i
 was a little skeptical at first but
 when he started explaining to me

  could see that he had really dis-
 covered something and when i
 started questioning him i was
 amazed he certainly did know
 what he was talking about

   so we sat down and talked for
 over an hour finally i asked him
 where he had learned so much
 about his work he smiled and
 took a little book from his pocket

    theres no secret about it he
 said the answers right here

 four months ago i saw one of
 those advertisements of the inter-
 national correspondence schools

  ever made-i knew it the minute i started my
 first lesson before i had been working in a sort
 of mental fog-just an automatic part of the
 machine in front of me but the l c s taught
 me to really understand what i
 was doing

               well that was just a start
             three times since he has come to
             me with improvements on our ma-
             chines- improvements that are
             being adopted in other plants and
             on which he receives a royalty he
             is certainly a splendid example of
             the practical value and thorough-
             ness of i c- s training

chapter i

on unpeopled plains

aptain nora riding
slowly homeward across
the unshaded plain her
horse following the thin
sunken line of a long-
disused indian trail
watched with something of a curious
intentness the distant approach of
another horseman she had been on a
visit to the nearest neighbor to the cres-
cent moon and had chosen this more
direct cut across the plain chiefly that
she might escape meeting the very man
whom the lessening distance between
them now made recognizable to her
sharp eyes

she had little kindly feeling for the
owner of the snake bar ranch and the

recent hour she had spent with his
young wife had added nothing to the
sentiment now that an encounter
with joel rand was inevitable how-
ever the girl braced herself physically
in her saddle as her spirit stiffened to
a brittle indignation within her

  they drew nearer to each other and
she saw the man bring his scowling
glance to bear upon her under shaggy
eyebrows that knit the short smile lift-
ing his lips over teeth that gleamed viv-
idly in the tanned parchment of his
face it was a keen glance in which
the girl fancied she could read suspi-
cion as well as the animosity that all
who knew joel rand expected from
him when he spoke however draw-
ing his horse to a standstill beside hers
it was with the semblance at least ot
conventional politeness


western story magazine

  i have just come from the crescent
moon captain nora i did not find
you there but i saw your foreman

and you

   yes said nora vane rightly inter-
preting his abbreviated question i
have just come from snake river i
am going to ask you a question-r-per-
haps you will think it an impertinent
one has it ever occurred to you mr
rand that your wife needs companion-
ship sorely

  for a moment joe rand frowned in
silence tapping the handle of the light
quirt he carried against the broad pom-
mel of his mexican saddle apparently
the abruptness of the inquiry discon-
certed him

  hasnt mrs rand the companion-
ship of her husband he then asked
his eyes meeting the girls fearless gaze
has mrs rand been complaining to
you captain nora

  she has not and you know it with-
out asking but i know the loneliness
of this life mr rand though i am
used to it and love it she is a stranger
to it perhaps you do not realize how
shut in she is and how often you are
away

  did she expect to find the plains
peopled with cities the man asked
and again he smiled mirthlessly and his
face grew darker still when the smile
had slipped from his features you
do not ask me what it was that took me
to the crescent moon he added and
his purpose in closing the other avenue
of their conversation was evident

  you told me that you had talked
with blaisdell isnt that quite suf-
ficient 

  he will tell you then said rand
dourly determined that i find my
fences cut again this morning captain
nora

  and you persist in suspecting some
one of the crescent moon outfit why
mr rand

  not because i in any way blame

its mistress he returned though she
seems ready enough to blame me

  of course said the girl flushing
slightly at his rebuke i will speak
with whitey blaisdell but i have every
confidence in our men and you might
well look nearer home for the source
of these outrages

  confidence in all of them he
asked ignoring her concluding sugges-
tion and she caught a covert meaning
in his tones you have taken on many
new men at times captain nora what
of them there goes one of them
now

  he nodded his head in the direction
of a horseman galloping easily across
the plain to their left apparently oblivi-
ous of their proximity his youthful
body pliant to the swinging motion of
his horse his attention seemingly fixed
on the dim mass in the distance that
was one of the crescent moons herds
what do you know of him for in-
stance asked joel rand

  the girls glance followed the insin-
uating nod i dont know anything
that is not good she replied then
her eyes lifted with a flash of defi-
ance do you

  joel rand shrugged his lean shoul-
ders i have met him riding over the
snake bar ranges he said i make
no accusations but i have seen him
there

  and must everything seen on the
snake bar range be a snake mr
rand

  though she knew the question was a
daring one even as she framed it nora
vane was not prepared for its effect
upon her companion his face whit-
ened with a quiver of speechless emo-
tion his eyes blazed into hers with a
light that puzzled her even in that mo-
ment of surprise and something in liis
twisted lips struck dismay to her heart
then after a moment rand laughed
an odd baffling laugh

  ive often thought of changing the
crescent moon



nave of my ranch he said indeed
i tried to once years ago but the name
of that infernal river stuck to it did
you ever notice captain nora how
hard it is to change an ugly name  i
remember way back in new england
a very pious maiden lady bought a
place that had always been known as
gallows hill she called it honey-
suckle lodge but no one else ever did
and her obituary read died on gal-
lows hill 

  watching him as he spoke nora
vane did not smile nor did he seem
to expect that she would words and
manner alike had been so patently but
a cloak for a state of mind he would
disguise she tightened the reins in
her fingers

  i will look into your complaints
she said stiffly in justice to my men
and i into yours he returned
perhaps i should have thanked you
captain nora for your interest in my
wifes happiness it leaves me your
debtor

  in that instant nora vane knew that
she had done isabella rand a dubious
service she regarded the man before
ier with level unflinching eyes into
which a contempt she did not seek to
hide gradually stole and lingered but
she made him no answer in words and
with a slight inclination of her head in
parting she put her horse into motion
rand too rode slowly away

chapter ii

lamblike in bearin

it was some years that the big cres-
cent moon rauch had been without
a master in the sense of having a man
as its owner but its young mistress had
proved herself such a capable manager
that the place was regarded as the
model ranch of the neighborhood the
boys called her captain nora and
not one of them from whitey blais-
dell the big blond foreman down

to the latest of the newcomers on the
range who would not have thought it
a privilege to risk life and limb in her
service-unless indeed it was the new-
est of them all tub mckee

  if for no other reason than his atti-
tude to captain nora the owner of the
snake bar ranch would have been un-
popular with the men of the crescent
moon but joel rand was moreover
a man who would have picked quar-
rels with the sky had he been marooned
in mid-air and he had come some
twenty-five years before to live on the
snake river range as the chum and
close companion of the man whose
tragic and mysterious death a few
years later had never tended to in-
crease the amount of faith and respect
in which rand his successor was held
his wife had died shortly afterward
and rand had recently married again-
a woman much younger than himself
her unhappy plight in the shadow-
haunted house in which she found her-
self more prisoner than mistress had
become the subject of gossip and com-
miseration throughout the sparsely set-
tled community

  thus when nora vane reached the
corrals where blaisdell and some of
his men were breaking in bronchos and
called the foreman to her she knew that
what she had to say to him would not
prove of especial relish

  i met joel rand just now she
told him he is complaining again
whitey i believe he saw you

  the foreman nodded in grim recol-
lection of the interview i told him
beggin yo pardon maam where he
could go

  it was scarcely necessary-or ex-
pedient whitey said the girl dryly
it made him angry and i made him
angrier he tells me he has seen
dandy darrow riding about his range
you had better caution him and all the
others to give it a wide berth what
a vicious little brute that is
l

western story magazine

  she indicated the mustang which had
already pitched larry sloane three
times and now with head between its
fore legs back arched and hind legs
drawn under its body was humped to-
gether for another spring if what it
had already done should prove insuf-
ficient almost at noras feet the
young cow-puncher fell sprawling

   now aint that plumb aggrivaun
he asked of no one in especial an
him so lamblike too in his bearin-
now hes done it agin but if them
jumps of hisn aint loosened my hair
an teeth nothin this side of kingdom
comes goin tuh

  he limped over to where the passive
pony was eying him slantwise with an
air curiously devoid of the elation he
might well have felt well fight it
out ole cayusc if every tooth in my
head hits a separate star the cowboy
confided to him and the proceedings
began again

  captain nora turned to look at some
of the others theyre working in all
right whitey she asked the new
boys

  fine maam that dandy darrow
is a dandy sho they all are capn
nora maam the crescent moon
keeps up her reputation for er fine out-
fit an whoever says anything tuh the
contrary says what aint so

  good but im sorry joel rand
has taken any notions about them into
his head i want to keep out of hot
water with him if i can

  oh him cried whitey blaisdell
in supreme disgust that old buzzard
d be spicious of every shadow maam
a well he might be im thinkin an
im sho sorry fur that po wife of
hisn

  captain nora cast her glance once
more around the animated scene the
corral presented moving quickly but
unafraid as one of the new ponies came
galloping close to her she paused with
her gloved hand upon the long bar of

the gate why do you say that  she
asked gravely

  wouldnt you be sorry maam fur
any one tuh go tuh live in that house
where so manys gone through strange
unhappiness tuh an untimely end

  nora vane looked her foreman
steadily in the eyes be careful
whitey she admonished though even
as she spoke the remembrance of joel
rands strange emotion when she had
talked with him that morning and the
recollection of his wifes apathetic de-
spair vividly persisted it is safer not
to lend ear-much better not to lend
tongue-to rumor the foremans re-
ply was unintelligible

  she went on up the road toward her
house walking with the elastic step of
perfect health her motions unimpeded
by the short riding skirt she wore to
the tops of her boots and the capable
air of one accustomed to command in
no wise lessened the girlish simplicity
of her manner

  in the low heavily beamed hall she
found her old nurse and companion
awaiting her how long youve been
child the woman cried do you
never get tired of riding about over the
country and here was joel rand
fuming and fretting at not finding you
and asking me more questions in a min-
ute than i could answer in an hour-
as though i kept tab on all the cow-
boys on the range and could tell him
who was this one and wrlio was that
why did he expect me to know dandy
darrow how did he know anything
about him himself how-

  nora held up a protesting hand
wait a minute mary you go so fast
she said you say mr rand asked
you about dandy darrow  what did
he ask you

  what didnt he ask me miss nora
who was he why was lie where
did he come from  was his name
really dandy was it darrow
everything but whether i w-as the
crescent moon



mans mother so i asked him that when
i could get in a word

  nora was watching her companion
with a detached expression i wonder
what his game is she said at last
he seems to have taken a dislike to
dandy darrow its rather odd too
i hope you didnt antagonize him
mary philbin laughed shortly he
was born antagonized she said now
get your habit off dinners been wait-
ing half an hour

chapter iii

a loaded offer

yvfhen joel rand saw captain nora
ride away he followed for a time
the trail that had brought her to their
meeting place but when increasing dis-
tance and the gentle rolling of the plain
had rendered the girl an indistinguish-
able spot on the horizon he turned
aside and pushing his horse across the
prairie made for the grazing herd
some distance ahead he could see the
moving figures of the young cowboy
and his horse

  at all times a morose man rands
mood at the present moment was one
of dangerous vindictiveness his frank
resentment of nora vanes somewhat
audacious reproof of him in behalf of
his wife but thinly expressed his real
anger pie had always been intolerant
of what he considered the prying inter-
est of his neighbors and with the pass-
ing of time this intolerance had grown
to be almost a mania though his
range was an extensive one and his
herds multiplied it was seldom that he
added to the number of workers on the
ranch and it was well known that the
sight of a new face about him was a
thing he brooked with ill-concealed sus-
picion and distrust

  but he had never before as on this
day carried suspicion and resentment
beyond the bounds of the snake river
lands nor had his opposition to the

intrusion of strangers ever led him to
do what he was doing now for upon
reaching the herd of the crescent
moon he rode rapidly along its ranks
until he overtook the cow-puncher

  dandy darrow had turned in his
saddle at the sound of the racking
hoofs of rands big roan and pulled
his pony in a change came over the
face of the young cowboy as he waited
the approach of the older man the
gray eyes beneath the level brows hard-
ened and darkened the firm jaws set
until clefts came in the tanned cheeks
the nostrils of the well-shaped nose
dilated tensely for a moment the
whole slight graceful figure stiffened
even the booted legs stretching straight
in the heavy stirrups then just before
joel rand rode up it relaxed and
dandy darrow threw the right leg
easily over the pommel of his saddle
his body settling into a forward poise
of expectant ease his features almost
nonchalant in their repose arms crossed
on his bended knee

  rand looked at him sharply scow-
lingly for all the effort he made to as-
sume some show of courtesy your
name is darrow i believe-dandy dar-
row they call you you are new on the
crescent moon

  not so new but that ive grown into
a name responded the cow-puncher

  rand caught his accent of refine-
ment trying cow-punching for a di-
version he asked insinuatingly the
question was ignored you will tire
of it continued rand then i sup-
pose you will be going back

  the upward glance of darrows eyes
was almost expressionless tire of
what going back where he inquired
lazily ive punched cows on slews
of ranches for many years ive never
struck any i like better than captain
noras tisnt so wild as some ive
known but i like it folks are more
law-abiding here on the whole

  thats as it may be rejoined rand

western story magazine

surly iu tone and look for lie resented

the very freedom of speech he himself

had invited some ones been doing
lawless deeds on my place ive been
to the crescent moon to speak about
it

  the information did not seem to in-
terest the young cow-puncher particu-
larly he was wondering how he might
best end the apparently meaningless in-
terview may be your place is the
exception that proves the rule he said
indifferently and there came a silence

  it was rand who spoke next if
you should ever want to make a change
in your employer darrow he said
let me know i do not often take on a
new man but i might consider you
you interest me

  i believe i should not care to work
on the snake bar

  the words coldly repressed brought
rand erect in his saddle he looked at
the speaker with sharp scrutiny what
objection have you to working on my
ranch he demanded

  darrow threw his leg back into the
stirrup straightening his lithe body
he too looked closely at rand as he
answered i dont like the name of
the place i dont like rivers that har-
bor snakes

  rands parchment face whitened
his mouth opened and shut on un-
spoken words darrow already was
turning his pony at least called
rand managing to speak with some
cordiality my offer stands for a
cowboy darrow you have unusual
whims

  he wheeled his horse his eyes how-
ever lingering on the younger man
then he rode off in an augmented sul-
lenness which was nowise abated when
he reached his house and found his
wife awaiting him in a listless patience

  at sight of her rands mood fused
into one of threatening anger what
do you mean he demanded as he
threw his hat aside by your whimper-

ing complaints of my treatment of you
if i ever hear of it again ill give you

something to complain about

  isabella rand a woman whose eyes
looked as though they saw a perpetual
regret picked up the hat which he had
dropped upon the floor i have made
no complaints she said in a dulled
voice

  you are a complaint who could
look at you and not read your discon-
tent i dont know why when i was
free i ever hung another wife about
my neck  and such another 

  the woman gave a gasp id will-
ingly be where that first one is she
cried stirred to an unwonted fearless-
ness even if i had to go the way she
went

  for a moment rand stood immov-
able his eyes set in a wordless passion
upon the accusing eyes of his wife his
face twitched in a short spasm that
made the woman watching it shrink
back her hand upon her heart then
he crossed the space between them with
a single motion

  say a thing like that again he
panted and you go the way she went
so you have been listening to the ven-
omous gabble about me have you
he seized her by the arm pushed her
toward the open door and heard her
go sobbing across the hall to her room

chapter iv

earmarks and others

it was shortly after his coming to the
crescent moon that leeds darrow
gave proof that he was not to be treated
with an undue levity and it was at
the expense of tub mckee that he had
proved it at the mess supper discus-
sion was running rife over the question
of wearing a bqiled collar without a
cravat when tub looking up from his
flapjacks saw darrow who was late
that night entering the door

 ask the dandy he oughter
crescent moon



know he said hes great oil know-
in how tuh make himself look pretty
and proceeded to fill his mouth with
cakes cvnd sirup

  it was not the words alone but the
insolent manner of their utterance and
the general laughter that greeted them
that whipped the quick color into leeds
darrows cheeks and lit his eyes with
fire it did not take him an instant to
act

  ask the dandys pardon you bull
calf he commanded and with fork
in mid-air the big cow-puncher found
himself whirled from his chair and
sent sprawling upon the mess-room
floor and when you do it drop the
the  added darrow amid the re-
spectful silence of the others as he
proceeded to his place at the table

  they remembered the incident and
no one had ever called him the dandy
since without the article he took the
use of the word as an alliterative com-
pliment it had been meant as one
when bestowed by whitey blaisdell
undoubtedly however the name stuck
because of the personal attributes of the
man no matter what he was doing
he alwa-s kept clean he wore his
clothes with a certain debonair grace
which some fine quality of masculinity
saved from any hint of foppery-for a
fop can remain a fop in booted blue-
jeans and flannel shirt his saddle and
equipment could have been picked out
of a hundred they were kept so trim
his horse which had come to him as
vicious and wiry a mustang as the
crescent moon had ever known had
undoubtedly acquired some of the
tastes of its master

  yet it was not alone in little things
that his companions felt darrows dis-
tinction none among them could
equal him in the deftness and precision
of throwing a lariat none of them
could carry a bunch of steers along
with the vim and dash that were his
only whitey blaisdell himself could

equal him in daring horsemanship and
though they all admired captain nora
and felt at their deferential ease with
her they yielded leeds darrow the
palm in a certain further touch of cam-
araderie of which they fell short it
was significant that they held this not
the least of his achievements and per-
haps envied it the most sincerely

  it was something of this sentiment
that actuated several of the boys one
morning soon after the day upon which
dandy darrow had been favored by
joel rand with his notice they were
in the corner of the corral doctoring
some calves and captain nora had
come upon them looking for the fore-
man

  yo play dand murmured larry
sloane capn noras callin yuh
dandy turned over his lariat to one
of the boys and went up to the girl
touching his hat as he neared her
have you seen whitey she asked

  whiteys gone out over the range
he told her will i do

  nora vane seemed to hesitate it
was about you that i wished to speak
to him she said at length are you
satisfied here dandy  do you like
your work and the outfit

  first class capn nora why

  i wanted to know because it seems
you are in demand elsewhere should
you care to leave the crescent moon
she held the quick look he gave her
noting the sudden sternness that came
into his face with joel rand he
supplemented

  it was her turn to be surprised now
  how did you know that

  because he has been after me his
voice held a curious repression

  her face clouded i am surprised
that he should do that she declared
try to take my men f she lif ted her
eyes with quick change of expression
you would not care to go dandy
he writes me that he would make you
his foreman


western story magazine

  i would starve before id touch a

cent of his money the young fellow
cried and something savage rang in
his words no capn nora with your
permission ill stay here

  i am glad she answered simply
you shall not lose by it

   she had already gone some little dis-
tance from him when she paused
what does it mean she asked this
desire of joel rands to have you in
his employ  he almost never takes on
a new man

  that i cannot explain to you said
the cowboy shaking his head

  she recalled afterward the momen-
tary hesitation in his manner and the
ambiguity of his words at the mo-
ment however she said no more

  others than joel rand had watched
with interest the problem that had sud-
denly confronted nora when her father
dying suddenly left her the sole in-
heritor of the big crescent moon
ranch men had drawn long faces and
predicted solemnly the ruin of the fine
ranch and the business richard vane
had built up but they had long since
admitted that they had had to eat their
own words the girl proved herself a
good manager with a talent for collect-
ing about her capable workers and the
crescent moon not only held its own
among the big runs in the county but
had forged ahead to the leading posi-
tion its young mistress was proud of
it she loved her life and shared it
pretty evenly with her men never los-
ing their respect of her dignity

  there were brushes with joel rand
her immediate neighbor on more than
one occasion the mans subtle enmity
was always to be felt he had been a
jealous rival of her father for the
daughter an element of baffled con-
tempt was added which of late had
grown into an acuter distrust because
of nora vanes attempted friendship
for his second wife

  yet thinking of him now as she

went back to her house nora could not
escape a conviction that his latest stroke
of interference had been prompted not
so much by the desire to annoy her as
to avail himself of her young assist-
ants services and though the matter
did little else at the moment than serve
to focus her attention and interest on
dandy darrow it did that to some ef-
fect then too for the first time it
occurred to her that darrows manner
had been strangely vehement if re-
pressed that his words had been curi-
ously forcible if also reticent and
she wondered not without keen inter-
est why

  her life had been free from any sort
of sentimental entanglement her
father had been her closest companion
she had had few other friends of either
sex she had always been surrounded
by men but no man had ever yet quick-
ened the beating of her heart yet she
had recognized from the first a differ-
ent attitude toward darrow insensibly
they had drifted into a quality of
friendliness she felt for none of the
others-a friendliness tinged by a sym-
pathy oftastes and interests it was
not that he had in any way presumed
upon the fact of his superior attain-
ment to ingratiate himself with her
it was inevitable that his more cultured
personality should appeal to her when
he entered her house it was natural to
him to be at ease there he knew her
books he knew her pictures the
music she liked was the music he knew
and liked

  yet now she felt assured that his re-
fusal to go to joel rand had been
prompted by some sterner reason than
mere disinclination to leave a berth
which had certain extrinsic qualities
which were pleasant for him thoughts
of his almost passionate rejection of
rands offer persisted in her mind
linking themselves inexplicably with
rands own redoubled effort to acquire
his services with rands implied accu-
crescent moon



sations on the day she had talked with
him and she found that the thoughts
troubled her and would not be ban-
ished

chapter v

getting stale

hen rand received nora vanes
curt rejection of his proposition
to part with darrow he was undoubt-
edly far more angry than the matter in
itself justified he tore the note into
many pieces turned upon its bearer
with a brusque dismissal and strode
across the lot to his foreman calling
him away from the men at work with
him before the barn door

  stalpas he asked what have you
heard of this young popinjay at the
crescent moon they call dandy dar-
row anything to his credit

  sour stalpas had all his life made
it a point to hear as little to any ones
credit as he could i aint heard noth-
in good ceptin he seems sort er in
with the young lady

  ah exclaimed rand looking
under his beetling brows at his man
very curious then stalpas that he
should be writing me asking for your
place

  askin fur my place echoed the
foreman with some incredulity the
sneakin buzzard of a coyote

  rand did not smile though his eyes
lit and a contemptuous tremor twisted
his lips just so he assented ive
seen him sneaking about this range
more than once dont sleep on your
job stalpas

  i aint slep on my job in the twenty-
five years ive worked for yuh joel
rand an yuh know it though i aint
sayin it mightnt ha been better if i
had onct er twice

  that may be responded rand
gruffly the thing is not to do it now
sometimes we grow stale with usage
stalpas

  he moved a step away haltingly

knowing his man he was not sur-
prised to hear stalpas following him
joel rand-sir 

  yes said rand turning his head
but concealing his satisfaction

  what is it yuh wish me tuh do
you know i hate prowlers about the
snake river the other muttered vi-
brantly in low tones get rid of em
dont ask me how do it and keep
your tongue close to the roof of your
mouth or-it may fall back in it

  this time he walked away in earnest
and the foreman let him go watching
him nevertheless with a narrowed and
menacing eye an yuh is capable oi
tryin tuh make it do jes that he
growled to himself but afore yuh

does joel rand-

  he did not finish the pleasantry but
his big hands clenched until the
knuckles gleamed and his face was
more lowering than ever as he rejoined
his men it had not however occurred
to his intelligence to doubt the veracity
of the statement rand had made him

  in the meantime rand himself was
slowly making his way toward his
house his mood was ugly his ready
suspicion was lashing the refusal of his
offer into a personal affront both on
the part of nora vane and her cow-
puncher why should a man young
and a comparative stranger in the com-
munity refuse so advantageous a prop-
osition unless he wished to proclaim his
enmity and what reason had this
leeds darrow-there could be no rea-
son unless-

  rand clenched his jaws with futile
wrath the very uncertainy of his
alarm doubled the sinister poison in his
veins had he played so desperately
all his life only to find that he had
sowed dragons teeth that would devour
him fear of this had been the haunt-
ing shadow on his path for years

  almost surreptitiously it might have
seemed he entered liis house and


western story magazine

  slipped into the room he kept for his
own use years ago when he had
shared that house with his friend ken-
neth desmond the room had been des-
monds den and office and though
rand had allowed none of the then
familiar objects to remain in it to-day
it was startiingly reminiscent to him of
the man who had built the low ram-
bling house of the snake river range
alter the disruption of his life in new
york the purchase and stocking of
the ranch and the erection of the house
had left desmond in somewhat straight-
eied circumstances and joel rand
making him a visit just at that time
and attracted by the place and its life
had induced his friend to let him be-
come his financial backer and perma-
nent companion

  ic had proved an unfortunate ar-
rangement for kenneth desmond the
man who as a friend had been agree-
able enough as a running mate de-
veloped traits well-nigh unendurable
the outward seeming of their friend-
ship was not entirely upset but those
who knew told strange stories of the
twisted state of affairs on the snake
bar ranch of the harassed look of
kenneth desmond the ever-growing
dominance of joel rand

  it was the year of the great freshet
on the snake river that kenneth des-
mond lost his life there were men
still working on the snake river range
and sour stalpas was one of them who
remembered that day rand and des-
mond had ridden out together to in-
spect the swolle river and the damage
it had done and rand alone had ridden
back his horse in a lather of foam and
reeled from his saddle as he told how
his friend had been washed away in
the swirling waters when a projecting
bluff crumpled and slipped into the
stream

  days later they had found a mangled
body floating in the quieted waters of
the river some miles below and joel

rand had become the owner of the

snake bar ranch

  rand was thinking of these things
now in the obscurity of the shuttered
room and his thoughts were linked
with other thoughts that ran back
through the years and left him very
uncomfortable and ill at ease was the
ground crumbling and slipping beneath
his own feet after all the time he had
lulled himself into a sense of security
he had never been able to banish
wholly the fear that out of that path
from which kenneth desmond had
broken away in wreck and turmoil there
might arise an avenging nemesis had
it come in the person of leeds dar-
row rand did not know but he sus-
pected and doubted and feared in turn
until the conflicting emotions maddened
him

  it was with a guilty start that he
stiffened in his chair at the sound of a
knock upon the door and swept into
the drawer certain letters time-stained
and worn which he had been going
over-letters by the way not his own
but kenneth desmonds then he rose
and opened the door to his wife what
brings you here he asked her sharply

  isabella rands sensitive face lit with
a pale flame of resentment there is
a young man outside from the crescent
moon who wishes to see you she told
him

  who is it he asked eagerly
then why do you stand there look-
ing at me like that is it so incompre-
hensible a thing to you that i might
be wanted

  he calls himself mckee she an-
swered no joel that would not be
at all incomprehensible to me 

  the words arrested him on his way
to the door his eyes suspicious and
crafty were upon her face his own
face darkened with a swift passion then
fell suddenly into a more ominous calm

there are times he breathed close
to her ear when i could think you less
crescent moon



dovelike than you seem you had bet-
ter take care dont dream too
wildly

  the woman shrank as he brushed
past her long after he had gone she
continued standing there against the
closed door which he had locked after
him almost as if she expected to hear
things beyond its barrier

chapter vi

bias and frills

raptajn nora with her dogs
 about her and her horse following
as docile as they moved about under
the shade of the big bois darc tree that
stood as a sentinel in the field where
the men were cutting the millet the
sharp whirring of the blades made
music in the august day following
the broad swathe of the mower dandy
darrow seated high upon the rake left
in his wake wide winnows of the fra-
grant heavy-headed grain

  every time he passed the point where
captain nora stood the girl greeted
him writh a smile and she was herself
unaware that her eyes followed his stal-
wart young figure with an interest that
was different from that which she gave
to any of the other boys-not even ex-
cepting the blithely debonair larry
sloane who drove his heavy mowing
machine with the air of a roman char-
ioteer while his spanking team of big
bays strained at the bits

  there was one in that field however
not unaware of the interest aroused in
the young mistress of the crescent
moon tub mckee had an eye for it
and after the manner of those gifted
with such power of vision he saw in
it a good deal that was not there he
had never forgiven darrow the sum-
mary rebuke administered for the care-
less use of his nickname when he
heard that joel rand was seeking to
augment his outfit he had applied for
a job there rand had refused it but

had easily ferreted out the reason for
the fellows dissatisfaction with the
crescent moon and made use of it for
his own ends it was with a whetted
purpose therefore that the big cow-
puncher as he turned the newly raked
millet watched the unconscious interest
of captain nora in the man who had
publicly chastised him

  he saw her when the noon dinner
hour came summon darrow by a
bright gesture of her head darrow
left his rake and went to the bois darc
tree where the girls horse stood near
her i can scramble on said nora
but since you are near help me up i
hate to go in it is so sweet out here

  she turned to her horse placing one
hand upon the pommel of her saddle
to her surprise when she looked
around darrow had not moved tm
not going in capn nora he ventured
in answer to her look i have brought
some lunch along theres a lot of it
if you would share it and the horses
can make their meal on millet shall
we stay 

  the girl hesitated she noticed that
the other men had already started back
toward the barns she herself seldom
ate much at midday and cool as it was
under the shade of the tree the sun lay
warm beyond she was tempted to
take him at his word shall i  she
asked and smiled

  for answer darrow strode over to
the rake and from its tool box took
out a parcel with which he made his
way back to the girl you set the
table while i water and feed the
horses dont think im lost if i stop
to pick some dewberries and theres
a red haw by the spring full of fruit
ill bring some of them

  and ill be scolded and put to bed
in disgrace by mary philbin said the
girl

  would she have done this with an
one else of the outfit she asked her-
self as she opened the parcel and


western story magazine

spread it out by the trunk of the tree-

a new self-consciousness was quick to
appear at the unusual little task had
she been quite wise would any one
but dandy darrow have made the sug-
gestion

  but it was done now and she ar-
ranged martha spences buttered ilat-
bread and wild-grape jelly fried
chicken corn pone and thick ginger
cake as only a woman could array
them and sat down on the running root
of the big tree to await darrows re-
turn

  martha spence treats you well she
said when he set down upon the
ground the tin pail he had filled with
berries and the jug of water do
you often eat your midday meal this
way

  in the open yes isnt it better
then riding miles through the sun to
eat in a crowded room only if i had
guessed id been going to have com-
pany id have done better with the
lunch

  ive an appetite replied captain
nora may i begin dandy

  there are few things that cement a
growing intimacy more quickly than
eating together-if indeed it does not
kill it before their impromptu lunch-
eon was finished nora vane and leeds
darrow had insensibly crossed many
bridges

  and the best of it-almost the
best said nora is that there are
no dishes to wash

  that is what i like about the life
out here replied darrow its not
cut on the bias with a lot of trouble-
some frills the city has so many
dishes to wash always

  the girl was silent a moment her
glance following the scythelike sweep
of shadow made by a buzzard flying
low above the newly mown field but
do you think you will stick to it she
asked wont you some day remem-
ber youve been through college and

want to go back where colleges are
they say new york never lets her
children forget her

 no said darrow and she was
aware of the quick clouding of his
lighter mood for  do not belong to
the wrell-ordered life of towns capn
nora  was born in vagabondia

  he caught the girls puzzled almost
disturbed regard he was himself very
serious weve become pretty good
friends if i may say so he went on
of course im only one of your cow-
boys-though im proud to be one-
but ive a purpose in life more serious
than driving cows for all that capn
nora and  think i am beginning to
fulfill it here can a man ask more
than to be doing what he wants to do
and is proud to do and what he should
do

 and that purpose dandy she
asked when his silence seemed almost
to invite the inquiry

  to her surprise-a little too to her
chagrin-he hesitated evidently reluc-
tant to answer she had never seen
his face so grave i find it strangely
hard to carry out after all he
turned to her with a quick change of
manner what is your opinion capn
nora of shakespeares hamlet-the
man i mean  do you sympathize with
him or despise him

 dear me what a jolt hamlet
why i sympathize with him i sup-
pose but i doubt if he would have
been very pleasant to eat lunch with in
a millet field all the same

  i fear i am something like him
said darrow and she was aware that
he still spoke with real earnestness

  he had a hard job on his hands
observed nora softly but after all he
managed it better than romeo

  perhaps admitted darrow and
the conversation languished

  captain noras thoughts did not
she was perfectly aware that darrow
had been near taking her into his con-
crescent moon



fide nee in some way she had failed
him it was not curiosity but interest
and adesire to show it that prompted
her to say what has your purpose
to do with hamlet

  he kept her waiting a little longer
it has nothing to do with hamlet
capn nora but it has much to do
with joel rand i have long felt that
i should tell you this much even if i
can tell you no more at present

  with joel rand she murmured
in astonishment and fell silent too as
whitey blaisdell and his men came
near

chapter vii

sound is cheap

vfhen nora reached her house-
and she was unwise enough to
start home almost immediately after
the arrival of the other men-she
found that the fangs of mary philbins
resentment because of her unappreci-
ated lunch had been drawn by the pres-
ence with her of sour stalpas
daughter nanny stalpas had come
over with some half-finished needle-
work she had been doing for captain
nora and though mary philbin
strongly disapproved of the younger
woman she could no more resist the
tendency to gossip with her than a fly
can resist sirup but if gossip was
sirup to mary it was salt on the tongue
of nanny

  where is the capn she asked
when she had been told nora was not
in the house they say shes gettin
powerful thick with this yere dandy
darrow ranch or no ranch she
knows the handsomest one of the
men

  mary resented the confidence and
led the way to the pantry in silence
there must have been a mighty poor
lot of them around nanny she said
motioning the girl into the room when
your ma took your father but now that
youve got that oft your mind sit down

and have a bite of the captains hot
bread hows everything on the snake
river 

  i aint carryin tales mis philbin
said the girl buttering her roll and
speaking with some show of resent-
ment but if i was i might say as
they was very bad up tuh the house
if he aint cruel to her mis philbin
ive learned tuh dodge pas bootjack
fur nothin an yuh know ive done
that ever since i was knee-high tuh ei
hoppergrass

  sakes alive cried the housekeeper
but then im not surprised

  shes that pale said nanny white
looks black on her

  poor soul and no wonder i recall
how the other one peaked and pined
an went out of that house feet fo-
most-as shell do nanny munched
comfortably on the thought the
housekeeper sighed i never could
figger out why she married him mis
philbin could you

  im not very good at figuring said
mrs philbin who knew such a luke-
warm rebuke would in no wise serve
to check her visitors tongue although
it salved her own conscience

  but what i aint able tuh see
through the girl went on is why this
dandy darrow tried tuh git pas job
seein he seems tuh be settin such store
by capn nora thats a hickory nut
that beats my psimmon plumb hollow
your persimmon is hollow nanny
declared the older woman her indigna-
tion again waxing or its full of silly
notion which is the same thing
youre dreaming child

  then i dream with both years
open retorted the girl fur i heard
ole rand tell pa so an pas had a hor-
net under his hat ever sinc i guess i
aint dreamin that or that

  she held out her arm bared above
the wrist where an angry red mark
turning bruised and blue marred its
g

western story magazine

whiteness lord child exclaimed
mary philbin did your pa do that
nanny rather nonchalantly went on
with her rolls and butter he meant
it fur my head she confided but i
caught it on the liy taint nothin
when yuh gits used tuh it but taint
xactly dreamin neither its er cheer-
ful place the snake river she added
sententiously you dont have tuh go
tuh no meetin fur ructions

  the door opened to admit captain
nora nanny she cried i forgot
all about your coming over to-day ive
had lunch mary she added simply as
the housekeeper rose i shared dandy
darrows out in the millet fields dont
hurry nanny but when you are fin-
ished come up to my room

  nanny turned slowly to her compan-
ion as the door closed upon captain
nora there mis philbin she ex-
claimed with triumph would yuh
call that dreamin or air yo years in
workin order him an her eatin in
the field in broad daylight

  you wouldnt have them eat in the
fields at midnight would you  de-
manded mary youve eajen quite
enough hot rolls are indigestible
but when the girl found herself
alone with captain nora in the latters
dainty room upstairs some of the girls
more flippant quality became subdued
to a more serious vein as she fitted
nora in the garments she was making
-nanny was very skillful with her
needle-she took occasion to remark
 i hings is goin very strange capn
nora over tuh the snake bar i caint
xactlv make em out nora was not
encouraging yohd better watch
dandy darrow capn nora hes
two-faced

  in her glass nora watched the
speaker why do you say that it
doesnt please me besides it is not
true

  whys he tryin tuh git pas job on
the snake bar fur then asked the

girl  not that im botherin tuh take
care of pa hes pernicketty enough
tuh look out fur himself i reckon

  it is the last thing he is trying to
do exclaimed nora

  i heard joel rand tell pa persisted
nanny pas mad as hops

 you heard- cried nora and

checked the words abruptly suddenly
aware of the serious meaning under-
lying the girls remarks what had
joel rands purpose been in such a
misstatement nanny she asked
are you very sure of what you say
dead sho an im sho too that
troubles brewin pas awful mad
an i spose yuh dont know he eems

the older girl looked worried tubs
er tub commented nanny her mouth
full of pins as she made certain draw-
ings-in of the garment she was fitting

thats all hes good fur-good fur noth-
in  but that aint savin he aint bad

dandy darrow

  nanny how you chatter how do
you learn all these things-if they are
so

  listnin said nanny sounds
cheap i

  upon this captain nora administered
a rather sharp rebuke take care
she said that you do not invest in a
lot of rubbish that has nothing but its
cheapness to recommend it what good
have  gained listening to you

  thats ahm said nanny a little
crossly as she drew the sleeves from
captain noras arms

chapter viii

at the btue maverick

it was true whether captain nora
cared or not to lend ear to nanny
stalpas- gossip that tub mckee and
stalpas had struck up a sudden and in-
timate relationship on the younger
crescent moon



mans side there was merely the desire
to get even in some not very desperate
way with dandy darrow but to stal-
pas this desire afforded possibilities of
the consummation of his own more
definite ends therefore with some
cunning he fanned tub mckees not
unnatural resentment into a smolder-
ing but steadily increasing enmity
which more and more frequently found
means to whet its own appetite

  curiously enough darrow himself
seemed the last one on the crescent
moon to become aware of the big
punchers state of feeling he had so
completely ceased to think of the initial
cause of offense that mckees innuen-
does and ugly little provocations lacked
pertinence it never occurred to him
for instance when at the mess table
he reached out for the dish of flap-
jacks only to have the last few disap-
pear on tub mckees plate at the psy-
chological moment that tub might be
doing violence to his stomach in order
to gratifyr his spleen it never oc-
curred to him when mckee in his
turn went to the distant town and
brought bade the crescent moons mail
that the reason there was never any
letters for him was because mckee
sorted them out and left them behind
in the lock box

  if i had yo chainces said stalpas
to his henchman upon one occasion
id er had him on his back with his
toes turned up long ago yuh aint got
the gizzard of er waitin buzzard 

  i aint wishin him no rale harm
stalpas said the other in some dis-
may jes kind er makin his life mis-
rable so hell pull out

  stalpas glowered sullenly sort er
ticklin him with er straw ladylike eh
tub he suggested with a pleasantry
that mckee in some way felt sinister
see if yuh caint make him cry eh
take care he dont eat yuh some day
he added with a sudden burst of
viciousness yuhre that tender

 d-w

  the blue maverick was doing a
rushing business that morning a band
of drovers from beyond the little pan-
ther had brought in their herd to the
stock pens and loaded them on the cars
and were now hitting up the re-
sources of the town preparatory to the
ride back to their distant range on
the squat porch of the blue maverick
they loitered over their yarns and be-
hind its swinging doors before the long
bar they hung- over their glasses and
about the oilcloth-covered tables they
lost themselves and their silver dollars
over poker and pinochle on the low
stage at one end of the room the much-
bedizened meadow lark was expend-
ing such voice as was left her singing
to the accompaniment of an ancient
piano some of whose teeth were miss-
ing now and then the audience rat-
tled their big spurs in applause and
encouraged her by such encomiums as
wring the neck of another kitty me
dear  or yuhll hev tuh let yo cinch
out fur er topnotcher like that mea-
dow lark-all of which the lady took
placidly

  at a corner table tub mckee had
been seated for some time enjoying
the unwonted pleasure of being the
guest of a party of strangers who for
that day at least owned the blue mav-
erick he had by reason of many
drinks just about reached the stage
where most things in life including
miss kittyr ogrady were enveloped
in a roseate hue for which indeed
there was some warrant in the case of
miss ogrady who was crudely rouged
to the tips of her ears

  from the window at his elbow tub
could command a view of the town
square about the hitching racks were
tied the ponies of the strangers after
the manner of cow ponies when not in
motion they stood in dejected attitudes
the day itself was somnolent caught
in a backwater of summer heat and
the town lay in dusty garishness al-

   most without -igti of life as if beaten
   in its efforts to reclaim the desert and
   so deserted in its turn

  it was upon this scene for all the
world like a stage setting awaiting the
advent of the actors that a solitary
horseman rode into view it was none
other than dandy darrow and see-
ing the medley of horses about the
hitching racks his gaze as a natural
sequence strayed toward the blue mav-
erick and lingered somewhat con-
cernedly upon the vision presented by
tub mckee in the open window cap-
tain nora did not encourage too pro-
miscuous a conviviality among the boys
of her outfit and darrow knew that
captain nora was herself on her way
into the town it was with purely al-
truistic motives therefore that noting
the evidences of tubs condition he
sauntered slowly over to the door of
the blue maverick and inside its swing-
ing portals

  his appearance produced a varied as-
sortment of sentiments generally un-
known as he was some of the drovers
seized upon him with proffers of drinks
more exacting than polite others
seemed disposed to regard him as an
interloper the meadow lark nodded
and broke into a weird rendering of a
song tub mckee glared at darrow

  for a minute or two darrow stood
looking about him not very success-
fully disguising his lack of vital inter-
est  hen he made his way over to
mckee who happened to be compara-
tively alone the capn is on her way
in tub said darrow youd better
take in a reef or two

  i aint tied tuh the capns petti-
coat growled mtkee

  youre crazy returned darrow
with some disgust come beat it
with me tub

  aint yuh ever been stewed yoself
dandy asked mckee his face flushed
and lowering  or is yuh scairt of it
hurlin yo complexion

  he spoke loudly and the taunting

ring of his voice drew the notice of
all those near them

  whos yo friend mckee in-
quired a drover coming closer
whats the matter partner he asked
darrow himself and the question car-
ried rebuke

  hes our dandy boy said tub mc-
kee with the fatuous daring of his
condition

  they laughed the meadow lark
coughed warningly while after the
manner of their own cattle al the men
in the room hushed talking and turned
their faces toward the augmented group
about mckee and darrow

  darrow felt the animosity he had
aroused he looked about him his
mouth ratlier grim it was tub mc-
kees voice that made him wheel
hes come tuh town tuh meet the
missus mckee offered with a laugh
he wants me fur er witness afore
the act lets all go boys

  and now dandy darrows face was
white and he seemed to cease breath-
ing he stepped quickly closer to mc-
kee say a thing like that again tub
mckee he threatened and weak
though you are ill wipe up the floor
of this room with you and if words
ever slapped a face he made those
words do it then

  mckee lurched to his feet and they
crowded around say it agin and
gave him his chance urged some one
behind darrows body and confronting
the speaker suddenly darrows eye
caught the gleam of a ready revolver
in the mans hand almost before he
knew his own act darrow had- struck
the arm an upward blow which sent the
gun flying through the air and across
the stage upon which the meadow lark
had ceased to sing and sat looking on
at the scene below her promptly she
placed her foot upon the revolver and
screamed aloud

  at once there was pandemonium
crescent moon



darrow found himself the center of a
half-intoxicated lot of men in whose
nostrils the scent of a fray was sweet
behind him his heavy bulk blocking
the open window stood mckee but
darrow gave no serious thought to the
window though more than one of those
around him had a revolver out he
drew his own calmly somewhat osten-
tatiously and he cocked it then he
started to walk through the throng of
those before him to the swinging doors

  it was the meadow larks voice that
rang out shrilly above the confused
hubbub she had risen to her feet on
the little stage and in her uplifted hand
she held the big revolver of the drover
who had drawn first upon dandy dar-
row and she held it ready for action

  ill pot the first man that touches
him she cried ill let out yo
cinches fur ye ye whisky-brave mush-
rats now fire away theres two of
us agin the crowd of yuh

  their mood veered as quickly as it
had risen they nearly burst the low
ceiling with their cheers of the mea-
dow lark they might not like her
singing but they took off their hats
to her pluck and they pocketed their
guns

the worst days work

q apt ain nora came and went

     it wras due to dandy darrow that
she steered clear of the neighborhood
of -the blue maverick and so missed
any opportunity of seeing tub mckee
in the glory of his cups

  theyre a roistering lot bent on
making a day of it darrow said to
the girl id give them a wide berth
capn

  she did so ard transacting the busi-
ness that had brought her to town she
had left darrow waiting for the special
object that had brought him and had
ridden homeward again

he was waiting now in the black-

smiths shop for the bolts whitey blais-
dell needed over his forge the black-
smith seized the opportunity for speech
you got off lucky dandy he de-
clared them boys of the double- v
is a tough bunch and tub mckee
is a born fool theyll fleece him of
every dollar he has theres him an
sour stalpas over by the hitchin racks
now birds of a feather-though stal-
pas is no fool

  and tubs only a fool fowler
said darrow

  maybe and may-be not and some
sorts of fools are just as dangerous
dandy as wiser scoundrels a fool
of a horse can break your neck jut
as slick as a vicious one indeed
theyre worse for you cant tell when
an idiots goin to have a streak of
sense

  he turned to the anvil and the con-
versation flagged fowler asked
darrow as the blacksmith thrust the
iron in the barrel of water and we t
to his bellows again youve lived here
about as long as any one havent you

  longer i reckon said the mar
they aint many have been here
longer some of the snake bar bunch
and a few others

  darrow lighted his pipe with some
deliberation you remember joel
rands partner then he suggested

  i remember kenneth desmond the
man joel became partner to amended
the blacksmith and it was the wors
days work kenneth desmond ever di-
when he let him if ever a prairie
dog took a rattlesnake into his burrow
thats what kenneth desmond did when
he took in joel rand and to my mind
he paid for it with his life the mo 
has kind of grown over that tombstone
but the feelin was pretty general here-
abouts at the time of desmonds
drownin

  there wasnt any doubt of his really
being drowned was there fowler

  it was hardl- a question rather the
western story magazine

quiet assertion of one who knew what
answer he might expect but the black-
smith turned around at his forge and
said slowly do you know dandy
ive sometimes had my doubts if he
really was that body they took for
his might have been any ones ive
sometimes had my feel in that he might
yet come back though i dont believe
joel rand has  think he feels he
did his job too well

  darrow was silent there had been
a gruesome suggestion in the black-
smiths manner and words

  a shadow darkened the doorway and
sour stalpas stood on the threshold
talkin tuh voself as usual he said
to the blacksmith blind in the dark in-
terior as lie came from the outer glare

  praps returned fowier an
praps not

  darrow rose from the keg of nails
upon which he had been sitting crossed
the dirt floor and took up the finished
bolts he merely nodded to stalpas as
he passed out

  he walked over to the hitching rack
wound his way among the horses and
strapped the bolts to a ring on his sad-
dle his mind still intent on the recent
words of the blacksmith his brows
drawn in heavy abstraction mechani-
cally he disengaged his yellow reins
from the several others thrown over
the same peg flung them over the neck
of the horse and got in the saddle his
eyes all the time intent upon the low
porch of the blue maverick where a
knot of men seemed to be watching
him interestedly

  he had gone not more than twice
his horses length when the blue mav-
erick began to empty itself as if by
internal upheaval and shouts and com-
mands apparently leveled at himself
for there was no one else in sight ar-
rested him abruptly running toward
him across the empty square came a
score or so of the patrons of the bar

among them the tall form of tub mc-
kee lurching heavily

  one of the foremost seized darrows
bridle what yuh doin on this yere
horse stranger r he demanded threat-
eningly is yuh bent on gettin yo
hide filled with lead

 what am  doing- cried dar-
row and stopped

  at first blush it might have seemed
his own horse but even the quick
glance he gave it now showed him it
was not bewildered he looked at the
reins in his hand at the saddle be-
neath him at the plaited tassels of the
headpiece which he had made himself
and then he knew and the light that
came into his eyes was not pleasant to
see with a sudden and heavy hand
he jerked the horse to it haunches
away from the clutching fingers at his
bridle

  this is your doing tub mckee
he cried and wheeled the horse vio-
lently

  but they were thick about him now
and they were in deadly earnest many
hands seized the reins of the rearing
and terrified horse though he beat them
oft with his loaded quirt suddenly
from the outer edge of the crowd the
noose of a snake lariat circled grace-
fully knocked his hat down over his
eyes and slipped about his shoulders
down over the muscles of his arms
where it tightened like a vise even
then however the men did not touch
him and he slipped back over the
haunches of the horse and stood facing
them

 he knew his danger for lesser
things than he had unwittingly done he
knew that ropes had tightened about
the necks of living men until they lived
no more he did not for a moment
doubt the temper of the men before
him whoever had done this thing to
most of them-to all of them except
one-it was no put-up game but a cool
attempt at horse stealing
crescent moon



  he managed to draw his pistol and
though he could not raise his arms
those nearest him respected its upward-
pointing muzzle what they might have
done nowever in that first moment of
their rage it would not have been dif-
ficult to predict had there not been
a sudden diversion in the forcible ad-
vent through their ranks of fowley the
blacksmith who was also the sheriff
of the town they fell back before
the heavy iron crowbar he swung above
his powerful shoulders

  whats all this  he demanded of
no one in particular and got his an-
swer from many he looked at dar-
row frowningly suddenly he strode
up to him and seized his gun arm
about the wrist do as i tell you
he muttered quickly close to darrows
ear then aloud drop that gun
he cried and bore down firmly upon
the young cow-punchers arm the
pistol fell to the ground now stand
back boys he called to the eager
crowd pocketing darrows weapon as
he did so this mans mine now-
and the laws hell get whats coinin
to him all right and you tub he
called to mckee put this saddle back
on the crescent moon horse where it
belongs theres tuh be no swappin
saddles an bridles in this town any
more than swappin horses now fall
back while i feed this fellow to the
calaboose

  to his surprise they stood back but
they followed jealously across the
square and up to the steps of the little
box of a jail

  once darrow seeing the curious eyes
of the townfolk upon him began to

protest see here fowler-

  the sheriff cut him short growling
shut up he muttered if youd
save your skin keep still therell be
enough for you to think about once i
get you inside lucky theres no one
else in the coop but you

  there darrow found himself an in-

stant later and listening he heard the
crowd gradually melt away from be-
fore his barred door and he turned to
look out through the grated windows
at the patch of fading sky

chapter x

some savvy

hthe next few hours were perhaps
the longest leeds darrow had
ever known the mere fact of his in-
carceration and for such a charge
stung him the evidence of his hav-
ing so malicious an enemy as the man
must be who had planned this thing
stunned him for the moment the
sense of the danger in which he stood
not from the law but from the law-
lessness of those he had offended per-
sisted grimly

  as the evening drew on he could
hear across the deserted square the
sounds of boisterous festivity from the
blue maverick the meadow lark
was again at the piano and the wheezy
scraping of violins the clatter of dishes
the sound of noisy laughter hinted of
no lull in the thriving business the place
was doing this day

  the light went out of the sky and
the sordid room fell into gray lit onfy
by the pale glimmer from an oil lamp
somewhere outside which sifted in
through the grated window indistinct
sounds from the outlying plains seemed
to steal in and cover the noises of the
town the far-away scream of a loco-
motive came to him lifting and falling
through the night

  his thoughts turned toward the
crescent moon it was already pafct
the supper hour there they would be
wondering what was keeping him
captain nora herself might be aware
of his not having returned

  it was not pleasant to him to think
of captain nora just then he was
innocent but he was a prisoner-a
criminal until proved innocent was the


western stoky magazine

wav he put it he shrank from touch-
ing-even the walls of his jail and stood
in the middle of the floor where it
seemed to him he could smell its odors
less

  the lock grated-he had not heard
the sounds of footsteps on the outer
stairs-and the door opened before
he spoke fowler turned the key in the
lock from the inside his face was
worried as he looked up at darrow by
the light of the lamp he carried how
in the name of jumpin jericho did you
ever come to do so fool a thing
dandy  he asked were you dream-
ifl or lovesick

   was dreaming replied darrow
and they chose a horse just like mine
neck and crop roach and all of
course id have found out in another
minute but they didnt give me time
of course said the other im
afraid of trouble you know what
dandy darrow nodded and im
bein watched muttered fowler
sour stalpas is doggin me like a
shadow whats he got against you
dandy

  stalpas nothing

  then youre still dreamm said the
sheriff didnt he try to keep me
from goin out to you  didnt he come
to the shop to do it didnt i have
to dodge him here just now an
didnt i tell you i saw him and tub
mckee round the horses just before
you left my shop

  i never thought of it before fow-
ler but joel rand wanted to make me
his foreman

  he did eh under the shock of
this intelligence fowler stood still a
long minute his brows knitting then
you look out for sour stalpas-an for
joel rand he said id sooner trust
a nest of rattlers dandy than those
two 

am i not safe from them here
asked darrow a bitter note in his voice
youll not stay here muttered

fowler safe here with them get-
tin wilder an wilder over yonder at
the blue maverick and the night long
ahead of us see here he said turn-
ing quickly to the covered basket he
had brought theres no grub here
dandy but this sandwich for youve
got no time to be pamperin your appe-
tite but heres a file and a sledge ham-
mer and your horsell be out yonder be-
hind the kitchen of the blue maverick
its the least likely place theyll think
of you goin and besides that kitty
ogrady s got her eyes peeled for any
one goin that way that gals got
some savvy under her paint and feath-
ers shes my actin deputy to-night

  she saved my life this morning

  i know why didnt you tell me
that gals are queer ill leave this
lantern he went on hang it in the
window youre not workin at-this
one ill be beatin about if you hear
a whip-poor-will calling rather soft
quit filin and dont drop out till you
hear the meadow lark singin the
sands o the desert then drop and
light out over the sands and run till
they grow cold and heres your
gun

  and you fowler asked darrow
touched what about you if the
come looking for me and find me
gone 

  me i dont git on the wrong horse
in broad daylight dandy dont yuh
fret about me only he added as
an afterthought you might chuck the
file and the hammer out in the tin heap
ill find em in the mornin when the
devils clear out

  darrow worked on the iron bar with
a will-the sweetest in the world and
it was not very difficult work he
heard no whip-poor-will call though
once he thought he saw a moving
shadow and dropped down out of sight
till it had gone thanks to the slim-
ness of his body the one bar removed
would give him space enough to get
crescent moon



out one blow from the heavy hammer
snapped it like glass when he had filed
it almost through then he waited

  it was the hardest part of the pro-
gram hours seemed to him to drag
by-hours lost in mere waiting a wait-
ing that became filled with questioning
and doubt and a mad impatience to be
gone what if the meadow lark for-
got or played him false or could not
work her scheme what if some one
discovered his waiting horse what
if  standing there idly waiting the road
of escape open before him he should
be trapped and caught and-

  clear across the barren square the
meadow larks strident voice launched
into the song he waited for he did
not know it but her face turned
toward the open window she sang with
an intensity which she began to fear
might defeat its own purpose so still
the room became as its occupants lis-
tened to the music

  almost with the first notes of the
song darrow hurled down the severed
bar drew his body up to the window
threw out upon the ground the file and
hammer and squeezing through the
aperture let himself drop to the earth
outside but even as he righted him-
self he felt a mans arms close about
him and twisted about to find the evil
face of sour stalpas almost touching
his own

chapter xi

in the chorus

it had sometimes been said of leeds

  darrow by those who thought that
they knew him that he wras an easy
mark others who knew him better
added until he was pushed beyond it
he was pushed beyond it now

  there was no mercy in the way he
fought it was all for those first few
desperate moments below the waist
his arms pinioned by the vicious death-
like grip of stalpas he had only his
legs but they stood him in good stead

with a swift upward blow of his
bended knee he wrung a groan from
the other stalpas was a big man and
powerful but darrow though light
was lithe and wiry as an eel and he
was killing mad just then he fol-
lowed up his disabling blow by a trip-
ping twist that sent stalpas staggering
backward to fall heavily to the ground
and in that fall his hold was loos-
ened

  it was darrows dread that the man
would cry out and give the alarm so
his freed hands sprang to stalpas
windpipe relentless iron thumbs
crushed out the mans wind his knees
pressed the broad chest then came
the sudden sound of shouts and clap-
ping which for once spontaneously
greeted the meadow lark upon the
conclusion of a song darrow got to
his feet

  she wfas singing again the meadow
lark repeating her song an instant
darrow stood listening looking down
at the quiet body of the man before
him then he turned and made for
the open road across which beyond the
low building which was the kitchen of
the blue maverick fowler had told
him he would find his horse he ob-
served no caution though he moved
quickly there was no one in sight
and even had there been darrow would
not have dodged he was free once
more and it would have fared badly
for any one to gainsay him then

  in the shadow of a woodshed he saw
his horse he did not have to make
sure it was his for the animal greeted
him with the soft whinny his master
knew as intimately as he would have
known a human voice he untied the
reins laid his palm upon the soft nose
of the horse and swung into the
saddle

  the meadow lark was nearing the
end of her song a little drunk she
was with excitement and success and
she sang the better for it
western story magazine

  darrow rode nearer there was a
wild elation in him compound of
many things he had gained his free-
dom he had fought an unprovoked
and dangerous enemy and wou tvvice
this day he had been helped stanchly
by a girls pluck and daring almost
to the window he rode and as the
meadow lark reached the culminating
bars of her song he raised his own
voice and joined in with full-throated
vim till the sands of the desert
grciv cold

  when he heard the sudden commo-
tion within and the sharp shriek of the
meadow lark leeds darrow drew his
pistol and turning his horses head
toward the open road raked the heav-
ens with six defiant shots then bend-
ing in his saddle his cheek almost
against the neck of the flying horse
he followed the blacksmiths injunc-
tion and rode like mad

  there was still tub mckee to be
dealt with and darrow dealt with him
the next morning in the same spirit of
contemptuous mastery mckee missed
his breakfast that morning and it was
not until he came pale and unsteady
into the corral where whitey blaisdell
with several others of the men were
gathered that darrow had his oppor-
tunity- the man who had gone into
town for the early mail had already re-
turned bringing back the full account
of yesterdays happenings of which
darrow himself had not previously
spoken

  mckee sauntered up to the group
if he saw darrow among them he saw
fit to ignore him his attention in-
deed centered upon the foreman but
at his approach darrow slipped off the
fence where he had been sitting and
went up to him

  he was not angry perhaps the
force of his anger had expended itself
upon stalpas moreover mckee had

not been himself and it was likely
enough was merely the pliant tool in
the hands of sour stalpas still mc-
kee deserved his punishment and re-
calling the fellows actions in the blue
maverick darrow proceeded to give it
to him

  are you sober yet he asked
planting himself squarely in the path
of the big cow-puncher not that it
matters much for sober or not youre
only a tub of a baby-a great big evil-
minded baby babies dont usually
have their faces slapped but im going
to slap yours mckee and suiting the
action to the words he applied four
stinging blows across mckees two
cheeks in lightning succession

  then suddenly to his own surprise
his anger blazed youre a coward
too he muttered and if you are not
a plumb fool youll take care how you
mix yourself up with me again

  he waited a moment mckee made
no move indeed he seemed dazed and
stood looking beyond darrow at white
blaisdell and the men

chapter xii

the light breaks

if id taken my own way about it

	tub whitey blaisdell was saying
that same evening to the disgraced cow-
puncher id ha gived yuh yo walkin
papers tuh onct but the capn wants
tuh give yuh another chaince she s
tole me tuh tell yuh some things
though an here they are

  he knocked the ashes from his pipe
and moved about his little sitting room
to which he had summoned mckee in
the kitchen beyond betty blaisdell was
singing softly as she washed up the
supper dishes

  yuhve got tuh cut out sour stal-
pas began whitey yuhve got tuh
cut out the whole snake bar bunch
tub an yuh got tuh treat dandy
darrow white-not but what he aint
crescent moon



abundant able tuh make yuh do so tub
now he knows yo spotted complexion
but yuh got tuh do it anyhow the
capn wont stand fur no monkey-
shines on the crescent moon an if
yuh dont like these stipylations yuhs
free tuh clar out tuh onct

  at the same time captain nora was
talking to leeds darrow in the hall
of her own house she had learned
with amazement of the events of the
day before and she had sent for dar-
row not alone to express her sympa-
thy and congratulations but to learn if
she might the meaning of the enmity
toward him of the snake bar foreman

  i wish you would do something for
the meadow lark capn nora dar-
row was saying i dont know that i
ought to ask you but i do

  i will said nora vane but
dandy this whole affair troubles me
what has joel rand against you of
course he is back of all of this

  she had already told him all she
had learned from the gossi-p of nanny
stalpas and darrows surprise had
been genuine when he heard of rands
misrepresentations to his foreman he
realized now that much he had put
down to coincidence was far otherwise
-that while he had been inactive rand
himself was laying definite plan against
him yet he hesitated over his answer
to captain noras question the girl
was waiting wondering at his reticence

  if you dont mind he said finally
id rather not tell you that-just now
-if you can trust me he added with
more anxiety in his voice than he was
aware of

  you know there is no question of
that

  i want to see him first he said
after a little silence i have been wait-
ing for him to make some move-if he
was going to-though i did not expect
it to be against me

  i believe she murmured i al-
ways have believed that he is a dan-

gerous man and i am very sorry
sometimes very uneasy for his wife
in the obscurity of the dimly lighted
hall darrow let his eyes meet those of
the girl

 you mean-

  i do not know what i mean but i
am afraid of him oh not for myself
-he cannot hurt me-but for that poor
woman and now she added with a
sudden candor he found very sweet
for you

  the little admission seemed to lift
darrow on billowing air she had said
it very simply with just enough hesi-
tation to invest the words with a touch
of personal feeling that like a delicate
flame spread through all that there had
been between them in the suffused
light of the emotion upon him he
spoke

  do you know that i worried in that
beastly little jail lest you might feel
it to my discredit to be there at all
did you

  of course it was foolish

  yes it was very foolish

  foolish of me to think youd care
one way or the other i mean

  nora did not answer overhead they
could hear alary philbin moving about
in the uncarpeted hall after a mo-
ment darrow rose to go

  she went with him out upon the low
veranda and paused at the topmost
step he seemed loath to say the part-
ing word the southern night lay very
still about them over the sweep of
prairie a low soft wind was stirring
and it rustled the bunches of pampas
grass and blew sweet in their faces as
they stood as if disturbed even by
their still presence a tree frog in a
near-by elm hushed its plaintive trem-
olo and fell silent on a few staccato
notes

  i must go he said in low tones
yet he didnt

  it is so quiet the girl murmured
western stukr magazine

g

i believe i could not live away from

it all dandy

   know to me too it has become
the only life it seemed very dear to
me last night he saw the slight
quiver heard the little in-catch of her
breath that was more than a sigh his
own voice was filled with vibrant ten-
derness i did not know how sweet
life was until i thought i might be
going to lose it i think i would have
fought for it like a tiger

  hush she pleaded it is horrible
to know such things might be he
turned to her abruptly holding out his
hand something made him afraid to
speak you will be careful dandy
i will be careful he assured her
and dropping her hand went down the
teps into the darkness

  the girl did not at once go in long
after darrows footsteps had died away
she stood there glad to be alone under
the stars glad of the darkness that hid
the warm color which flooded her face
she had never loved before but she
needed not to be told what was the
strange joy that filled her what it was
that made her after a time sink down
upon the steps hands clasped about her
knees lips tremulous as they parted
over her unspoken secret

chapter xiii

the limit of endurance

it was a long time before leeds dar-
row sought his bed that night the
even tenor of his life on the crescent
moon at last had been violently dis-
turbed and to him also there came
the certainty that never again would
that life resume its accustomed way

  -ie had said to captain nora that he
had been waiting for joel rand to make
a move and now the move was made
he was under no delusion as to how
disastrously it might have resulted for
him though the foreman of the
snake bar was a far more dangerous

enemy than tub mckee darrow knew
that stalpas himself was the agent of
the still more dangerous joel rand
there was some truth in the statement
that darrow had to reach his limit of
endurance before he would strike
coming to the neighborhood as he had
done with a definite purpose in mind
he had drifted into the pleasant lines
of life on the crescent moon his pur-
pose was not forgotten but deferred
and while he drifted and waited joel
rand had struck that his envenomed
blow had missed darrow understood
perfectly was due mainly to a happy
combination of circumstances which
might not again work so favorably in
his owrn behalf

  but he would wait no longer now
even had something else not leaped
full-panoplied into his heart and life
he knew that further inaction would
now be weakness and leeds darrow
wras not weak men learned that to
their cost as tub mckee in his dull
way had come to learn it as sour
stalpas had learned it in more than
one meaning of the word as darrow
promised himself joel rand was to
learn it

  his anger burned hot against joel
rand as no one else in the world
he held the secret of the mans evil
life he could interpret the baffling
phases of his meanest actions he knew
that he had the soul of a coward and
the venom of a snake-a false friend
and a treacherous enemy

  but even more on this night than
thoughts of joel rand thoughts of an-
other persisted in leeds darrows
mind until those hours in the jail he
had never known how near the precipi-
tous brink of love his feet had strayed
he knew it then by the ache in his heart
which came at the thought of nora
vane but that knowledge was noth-
ing in comparison with the full light
which burst upon him this night and
with this came the first sweet torturing
crescent moon



doubt of the lover-a doubt whidh
waxed and grew as lie remembered the
cloud that lay upon him the cloud of
which nora vane knew nothing

  he went to the window and stood
there looking out upon the little street
of ranch houses silent and dark as if
they too slept with their sleeping in-
mates the wonder of the limitless
plains crept over him as he watched
the very sound that came to him em-
phasizing their bigness and freedom
he had known those plains and others
like them for many years now yet
sometimes it seemed to leeds darrow
that not all the clean ozone that swept
them could ever blow from his nostrils
the smell of towns the petty meanness
of what he had known of men and
women there the ugly lights and shad-
ows of his own early days for were
not the meanness and the lurid pas-
sions about him here too

  he could not banish those searing and
distressful thoughts he dreaded to
tell captain nora as tell her he must
if he would tell her of his love it was
the thing which all his life had clouded
the natural buoyancy of his nature and
now as these thoughts lashed and
scourged he forgot his immediate sur-
roundings and leaning against the
jamb of the window struck it with
clenched and rebellious hand

  larry sloane tossed on his mattress
and darrow turning remorsefully
puffed out the light he had kept burn-
ing dimly and went back to his place
by the open window

  a whip-poor-will from the roof of
one of the cabins near by set up its
quick call so near it was that the soft
purring of its starting notes seemed
almost in the room

  dog-gone that whip-po-willer 
muttered larry seizing the vicarious
opportunity to announce his- wakeful-
ness

  darrow slowly began to undress his
mood veering suddenly

  larry he declared i dont feel a
bit sleepy do you larry did not
answer i dont know of anything
more irritating larry than to see some
one else sleepy when youre wide
awake yourself

  unless growled larry unwisely
its tuh see some one else wide awake
when yuhre plum tuckered out fur
sleep yoself

  darrow laughed softly kicking off
his boots join me in a smoke
larry he invited dont be so un-
sociable suppose that double y
bunch had sent me to kingdom come
last night you wouldnt be having
the pleasure of my company now and
they came near it larry

  he turned toward the irresponsive
cowboy every inch of whose back was
a silent protest

  what point have you arrived at
larry in your cheerful and sane phi-
losophy as to where a man finds himself
when whether by his will or no he
shuffles off this mortal coil and steps
into the beyond

  ten tuh one he finds himself where
he dont expect tuh be mumbled
larry an i wish tuh goodness you
was there

  you think so meditated darrow
peeling off his garments and what
is your idea of that place larry
poets and philosophers are not all
agreed whether we are to lie in cold
abstraction and to rot-or to reside in
thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice
personally i lean to the convictions
that we carry our own purgatory
about with us eh larry

  ice cried larry jerking himself
to a sitting posture as though he had
suddenly come in contact with that ob-
ject air yuh gone plumb loony
dandy fur the love er mike cant
yuh quit yo kiddin an hit the straw 
yuhve busted my entire night

  darrow laughed amusedly  fq- e
d-which was to be proved  he

quoted with a sapient air and then he
dodged larrys pillow punctuating the

the rending veil

it was scarcely with surprise that

	a few days later joel kand seated
on the veranda of his house saw a
horseman approaching whom he soon
recognized as the man of the crescent
moon to whom he had offered the po-
sition of foreman on the snake bar
ranch rand realized that thanks to
the clumsiness of sour stalpas his own
part in the attempt to embroil darrow
with the men of the double y outfit
must have become evident to its vic-
tim it was possible however he re-
flected that after all the young cow-
puncher came to him on some errand
from captain nora when darrow
had composedly hitched his horse and
was walking toward the steps rand
rose and went a tew feet to meet him
he did not speak first but scanned
darrows face in a penetrating silence

  i regret that i shall have to claim
a little of your time joel rand

  rand nodded he was not pleased
with this manner of address curt de-
void of respect brittle with contempt
doubtless you come leeds darrow
to inquire as to your handiwork on my
foreman-the brutal attack of a fugi-
tive from justice upon a defenseless
passer-by

  really cried darrow surprised at
the mans audacity i had not con-
sidered it in that pathetic light with
your permission i shall reserve the
privilege to do so at my greater leisure
i have to ask you to consider it in a
slightly different aspect as for your
foreman the condition of his health is
a matter of no consequence to me
you are bold said rand too
bold it would be well for you to be
careful

 why

  the cool question staggered rand

and it drove him to a rage which made
him abate some of his prudence for
one thing you are an escaped horse
thief he cried

  and for one thing you are a liar
to say it responded darrow standing
very still before him and that is only
one of many things that you are be-
sides-worse things you almost have
to be a liar joel rand

  in that moment the veil was rent
between them rand doubted no more
his ashen face and twitching mouth
rendered the struggle he still made for
outward composure a pitiful travesty of
dignity

  i think continued the cowboy
that you begin to have some inkling
now of what it is that brings me here
why it is i come who it is i am there
are yet some things you do not know
however concerning which it becomes
my rather satisfactory duty to enlighten
you you have called me a thief and
i have told you that you lie in saying
it i call you now a thief also and
liar again if you attempt to deny it
do my words need any explanation

  the semblance of rands composure
was shattered now i will not listen
to your insane words he cried in a
craven fear by what right-by what
impertinent presumption-do you dare
to come to my house using them to me
ill have you thrown off my place ill
have you turned over to the law you
have defied ill show you what you
risk when you pit yourself against me
he turned toward the house his main
object escape though he managed to
make some show of angry determina-
tion

 darrows next words cool and
crisp halted him i have not finished
with you joel rand he called i
have only begun i have no desire to
enter the house you call yours so long
as you are in it but enter it i must if
you do not remain here he looked
crescent moon



straight into the harassed face the man
turned upon him

  you would not dare muttered
rand but his hands were twitching

  do you think joel rand that i
have any reason to fear the ghost of
kenneth desmond if you can bear
to live in that house surely i may enter

it r

  it was a spring that brought rand
back before the younger man

  what do you mean by that de-
manded the other why should i
fear the ghost of kenneth desmond
you chattering thief of a cow-puncher

  he stood very close to darrow and
the eyes of the cowboy focused upon
those of his questioner whose hand un-
seen stealing to his hip had drawn
from its pocket the revolver and held
it behind his back

  there was a curious expression upon
his drawn face fear was evident but
he had not yet lost the crafty cunning
which rather than anyr courage or any
generous impulse withheld his impulse
to shoot

  even under the sting of the insult
offered him darrow noted the odd con-
flict of passions he himself had be-
come very white rand- he be-
gan when he was interrupted

  a womans voice lifted in a cry of
startled warning rang out through the
day look out she screamed hell
shoot

  rand whirled around on the ve-
randa running toward them was isa-
bella rand but she stopped abruptly
at the sight of her husbands face as he
leaped forward to her and seized her
arm his other hand holding the pistol
which showed only too clearly his re-
cent desperate inclination havent
you learned your lesson yet he cried
then come with me

  she made no struggle uttered no
sound as rand drew her roughly after
him toward the door only over her
shoulder she looked toward the aston-

ished darrow and signaled him to go
away

  an instant he stood uncertain then
as the house door slammed between
them he obeyed the wild entreaty he
had read in the womans eyes and went
over to his horse

  a little longer he muttered to him-
self your time is almost up joel
rand

chapter xv

heavy on his mind

ljad he been able to foresee rands
actions upon his departure dar-
row never would have gone alone
with his wife in the hall the man
turned upon her he spoke with a
deadly anger in his eyes why did
you call out so to that fellow just now
to save you both she answered
though i dont know why

  it is as well he then said and re- 
leased his brutal grip and threw her
from him perhaps for once you did
me a service there is another and a
safer way for me

  joel said the woman with her re-
cent fearlessness is there no fear in
you of the day of your reckoning

  he lifted his head the first thing
that made me hate you was those ac-
cusing eyes of yours he said between
his teeth ytoud better go before 
make you

  he lost no time when she had left
the room putting into execution the
plan that had come to him he made
some changes in his dress left the
house and went to the stable for his
horse it was there he met sour stal-
pas still wearing a bandage about his
head

  i want my horse said rand and
be quick about it stalpas and see
here he called to the retreating fore-
man are you sure that no one saw
you and that moon calf of a mckee
swap those saddles

i swapped no saddles replied the
ao

western sruttf magazine

man but there war nt no one saw him
do it

rand smiled with covert sneer
excepting you yourself eh stalpas
their eyes met distrustfully on the
part of stalpas searchingly on the part

of rand oh your secret is safe
enough with me said the latter after
a minute and i guess youve got all
that is coming to you for that particu-
lar little play stalpas im not so sure
however of that blabbing tub mckee
now hurry up and get my horse well
why do you stand there loitering

  my secret yuh call it joel rand
my secret

  smoldering rebellion burned in the
foremans eyes his gruff voice was
shaken by an uncontrollable passion
wasnt it of your own hatching
asked rand would i have been
likely to think of such childs play
now hurry stalpas

  but stalpas did not budge except
to step closer who was it put me
up tuh that childs play joel rand if
it had all panned out as it come nigh
doin whose ends would ha been
gained mine yuhre mighty slick
at steppin from under mister rand
but theres a secret or two o yon what
it might not be rale pleasant fur yuh
tuh let the daylight git on my secret
is it

  rand angry and surprised strode
over to the peg where his saddle and
bridle hung your brain must be
numb from your beating stalpas for
you to talk to me so dont you know
i could-do you forget what i could
do to hush your braying shall i have
to tell you again that i want my horse 
stalpas snatched the bridle from the
others hand i aint furgot nothin
he muttered nothin jes yuh re-
member that

  ill overlook your insolence because
of what you have been through said
his employer but never speak to me
this way again stalpas i warn you

  muttering beneath his breath the
foreman moved off as he saddled and
bridled the big roan rand stood by in
an impatient silence

  get some one else tuh do yo dirty
work growled the foreman as he saw
him ride away yuh lyin thievin
murderin foxl yuh slippery copper-
head r

  rand covered the long distance to the
town in a few hours and when he
reached there went straight about his
business fortunately for his purpose
he found fowler alone at the forge

  i have a job for you fowler he
announced dismounting within the door
of the smithy im afraid you must
drop what youre doing to attend to it
drop what im doin to attend to
what demanded the blacksmith mak-
ing no pretext of cordiality im too
all-tired busy to drop anythin to attend
to anythin else this mormn

  im sorry persisted rand but
this has to be done

  the blacksmith slowly drew the
white-hot bar of iron from the fire
earning it with his tongs to the anvil
all his movements were deliberate and
methodical and the glance he bestowed
upon his visitor was unhurried

  he struck several springing blows
with his hammer before he replied to
be perfectly free spoken with you joel
rand im not a whole lot eager to
work for the snake bar ranch and
what is more im not going to to-day
and i reckon i know when i drop my
work and when i dont without being
told by any man

  under the frank contempt of man-
ner and words the rancher colored
darkly though he curbed his evident re-
sentment you go rather fast fow-
ler he answered who said anything
about work for the snake bar  seek
you in another capacity than as a black-
smith i demand that you arrest one
accused of a criminal offense a jail-
crescent moon



breaker and a horse thief i mean
of course dandy darrow of the cres-
cent moon outfit

  you do do you exclaimed fow-
ler who for some seconds had been
not wholly unprepared for the demand
who says dandy darrows guilty
that is not the question and you
know it replied rand you are re-
sponsible for this mans detention in
your jail from which he escaped with
rather suspicious ease he is at large
i demand his rearrest

  the mans not guilty persisted
fowler stubbornly though he realized
his defenseless position

  there are ways for him to prove
it and get his acquittal

  the blacksmith raised his eyes and
looked at his companion with penetrat-
ing shrewdness you seem powerful
eager to see him in jail is it because
of the beating he gave that wolf of
yours 	

  rand did not reply for a few min-
utes the blacksmith beat his iron appa-
rently oblivious of the others presence
but in reality with mind set upon the
problem confronting him im not so
sure he remarked suddenlyas he
took another grip with his tongs that
considering your very acute interest in
dandy darrow jail isnt the safest
place for him and his eyes lifted
squarely to rands ive half a mind
to do as you suggest

  you will do as i demand said
rand and turned his horse

  wait a moment

  something stern in the command
brought the rancher face about in-
stantly fowler plunged the iron in
the water and let it sizzle there a
space before he threw it on the ground
there had come upon his rugged hon-
est face a look that the other did not
like

  i will do this tiling he said not
because you order it-for you could
order me till the sun in heaven got

frost-bit and not put it over-but be-
cause for once you chance to be on the
laws side and because as i already
said when you get interested in a man
that man needs the protection of all the
law there is thems my sentiments
about you joel rand an theyve been
heavy on my mind for many years

  he waited until rand had ridden
away wordless in his anger through
which there ran that ever-recurrent fear
that had long since licked his prudence
into a slimy craft and then the black-
smith-now the sheriff-took off his
leather apron locked the door of his
shop and went about getting read for
a duty which for all his coolness he
was loath to do and which for dar-
rows sake he would have evaded had
he dared

chapter xvi

a poor return

nt ot knowing just where he might
find darrow at that hour fow-
ler when he had reached the crescent
moon rode with his posse to captain
noras house and dismounting under
the surrounding elm trees made his
way alone to the front door it was
miss vane herself who having ob-
served his approach met him there

  why mr fowler she demanded
already indignant what is the mean-
ing of this

  i see you know maam so i wont
try to deceive you anyway i come
to you to ask where i can find dandy
darrow

  the girls eyes were on him spark-
ling with resentment it is preposter-
ous if you mean you have come to ar-
rest him she cried he is no more
guilty than you or i

  the sheriff smiled somewhat uneas-
ily twisting his hat in his big hands
you see the trouble is maam capn
nora hes already arrested and i am
sworn to carry out the law i dont
know that id have done it if i hadnt


western story magazine

been put on to it but i cant help my-
self now

  so some one put you on to do it
sour stalpas j suppose  hat is the
law you must carry out is it obey
the malicious spite of the guilt that
the innocent may suffer i thought
belter of you

  dont scold me maam in the first
place it wasnt sour stalpas it was
joel rand and he was bent on havin
his way and the law curious critter as
it is is as much for a devil as an angel
till theyre branded

  captain noras whole body stiffened
ah she exclaimed and fell silent
obviously concerned fowler stood
watching her presently she spoke
have you any idea at all who it was
that did this thing dandy darrow is
accused of-taking a horse i mean

  yesm ive an idea and its a
good strong one at that but-its only
an idea the lawr takes no account of
ideas

  no said nora it prefers to
blunder along without them i have
a good strong idea too mr fowler
and it amounts to certainty you are
not going to rear rest leeds darrow be-
cause i am going to show you the man
who tricked him into getting on that
horse after putting his owfn saddle
on it

  she called a young fellow wrho was
at that moment engaged in hauling
wood for her woodshed bud she
said i want you to go at once and
tell whitey blaisdell tub mckee and
dandy darrow that i want them here
immediately you know where they
are

  she did not speak until he had gone
away then she turned to fowler it
was tub mckee that did it he and
stalpas leeds darrow has not ac-
cused them but it is as plain as day

  fowler nodded his sturdy head
right you are maam but i cant ar-
rest tub on suspicion only

  no but you can make him think
you are going to moreover  have
the assurance of an eyewitness to that
plot i cant tell you-unless  must-
who it was perhaps you can guess

  the sheriffs eyes twinkled he
looked at the girl admiringly i think
i can he said slowly and i think
i see your meaning maam its a first-
rate idea youve put into my head
youre er prime line gal capn nora
pardon the sayin so and if the mea-
dow lark aint in just the same list
of songbirds with you shes got her
good points too

  i know a man mr fowler when i
see one responded the girl my
father was a man you are leeds
darrow is one ive been disappointed
in mckee i admit

  theres bound to be some bad nails
in a keg and i myself sometimes make
a fairly good one into a bad one tub
wasnt much of a nail to start with
but hes been drove worse

  ive given him his chance and he
is acting badly said nora sternly i
am not going to shield him at a better
mans expense-at any mans

  so when a little later the men she
had sent for arrived captain nora
went out to meet them at her side the
blacksmith-sheriff his posse gathered
in evidence a few feet away under one
of the trees

  to have observed the three men of
the crescent moon outfit no stranger
would have surmised that the show of
the laws authority so assembled was
directed against the one who displayed
the least emotion whitey blaisdells
surprise and indignation were clearly
to be read in his blue eyes and the
flush of his fair skin darrow greet-
ing the sheriff in a manner more than
friendly was unperturbed it was tub
mckee whose face paled whose un-
easy eyes shifted continually from
fowlers stern gaze to miss vanes
steady and keenly appraising regard
crescent moon



  whitey said the girl i have sent
for  three because since i told you
that  wished you to give mckee here
another trial after his misconduct at
the blue maverick the other day i
have learned of a far more serious
thing against him perhaps i should
have borne longer with this mans sul-
len behavior except for what you see
before you here now

  she paused an instant glancing
toward the group of men under the
tree and nodding toward fowler

  never before she went on in all
its history has the crescent moon been
brought into the hands of the lawr it
is a poor return mckee for the trust
i have placed in you

  mckee fidgeted i never meant no
wrong tuh you capn nora he de-
clared after a silence during which
fowler had shown signs of impatience

  but you meant wrong to this man
said nora looking at darrow and
you linked yourself with his enemies
against him you are practically a
murderer mckee and your sin has
found you out

  he was trembling now and his face
whitened it needed only a quick move-
ment of the sheriff to unnerve the big
fellow completely yuh aint godn
tuh lock me up fowler fur what i
done he cried  tvvas sour stal-
pas made me do it-him an joel rand
i meant no rale harm tuh darrow but
they did taint me as should be took
its stalpas hed ha killed darrow
he tole me so he tole me tuh do it
but i wouldnt

  he was almost blubbering and he
stepped backward almost as if he might
have turned and fled captain nora
caught the look of pitying disgust on
the faces of the three other men and
herself turned her back on the un-
pleasant exhibition

  stalpas even helped me swap them
saddles fowler she heard him plead-
ing  twas he picked out the horse
d-w

that looked most like darrows i
wouldnt ha done it nohow had i been
sober

  but here the sheriff burst out in
righteous wrath shut up you blub-
berin crybaby he cried his voice
ringing with contempt youve said
enough to vindicate dandy and the
law dont want to touch anythin like
you--yet your time aint quite come
tub mckee and i hope when it does i
dont have to be the one to handle you
i wouldnt know exactly what to do
with you i havent had much experi-
ence wtith babies but dont be scared
tub when i comes to arrest you ill
fetch a go-cart and a feeding bottle
and it wont be to the crescent
moon youll come either said captain
nora turning about suddenly see
that he goes whitey and now mr
fowler bring your men into the din-
ing room so they wont be able to say
they rode all the way out to the cres-
cent moon and got no tiling for their
pains

  throughout the scene she had not
spoken to darrow now as she passed
near him she paused it was you they
came for she murmured joel rand
demanded it you have seen him
yes i can understand

  then be on your guard she cau-
tioned and went on alone towrard the
house

chapter xvii

wings of evil

ieeks went by summer waned
into early autumn and still de-
spite his resolution darrow had not
again sought joel rand it was miss
vanes dread of further unpleasantness
which deterred him but he chafed at
his inaction

  rands attempt to have him arrested
had in no way surprised darrow for
he was aware of the galling hate which
the man must bear him since their
stormy interview that rands efforts


western story magazine

to remove him had failed did not de-
ceive darrow into thinking that they
would not be resumed and in stal-
pas too he realized he had made a
personal enemy

  grave reports drifted over from the
snake bar upon one occasion cap-
tain nora riding over to see isabella
was met at the door by rand himself
and-albeit with some observance of
courtesy--was practically denied ad-
mission nanny stalpas later received
orders to keep away from the crescent
moon-orders however which only
served as an added incentive to het to
go there in order to discuss them with
mary philbin

  nothin but hobbles is goin tuh tie
my legs she said to the housekeeper
when she was telling of the commands
laid upon her an id like tuh see the
man as is goin tuh put them onto me
sho pa aint an dead sho joel rand
aint i

   or your tongue either nanny said
mary for she had been cautioned by
captain nora not to encourage the
girls propensity to carry news

  no nor my tongue neither mis
philbin though what harm im doin
in savin joel rand is slowly drivin
his wife tuh her grave i aint sharp-
sighted enough tuh see if it wasnt
fur me the po critter wouldnt have
no one tuh stan by her

  hows he doing that nanny
mary was unable to resist asking

  how in every way thats jus
it mis philbin in every way when
she speaks he shuts her up when
shes quiet he gets mad at her if
she happens tuh fancy sometliin shes
eatin ive seen him snatch it from her
cause she was so slow over her food
if she doesnt eat he curses at her
fur sulkin hasnt yuh ever seen a
boy pester a tumblebug mis philbin
he dont kill it outright but he punches
it an rolls it over an when it gits
up he rolls it over agin an when it

crawls he pokes a stick in front of it
till even a tumblebug whats born tuh
do everythin over an over agin gives

it up an dies thats how

  mercy alive cried mary the
capn really ought to know

  sho said nanny thats wrhy i
come over tuh tell you

  in other ways they heard of joel
rands bad temper when tub mc-
kee went to him after his dismissal
from the crescent moon rand ilew
into a storm of abuse and drove the
big cow-puncher from the snake bar
he was making the life of sour stal-
pas so unbearable that upon more than
one occasion the foreman turned upon
him with fangs bared

  these thingsdarrow knew and lie
knew other tilings besides which he
kept to himself he knew that he was
repeatedly stalked at night when as
wfas often his habit he strolled alone
across the plains before he turned in
and he knew also that notwithstand-
ing captain noras wishes this state
of things could not continue

  therefore catching sight of rand
upon his big roan as he was returning
one afternoon from the town damw
put his own horse into a gallop to
overtake the ranchman before he should
reach the snake river fork at the
same instant he saw rands horse
stretch out into his swinging rack and
cover the ground with amazing speed

  darrow gritted his teeth a grim de-
termination fusing within him he was
sure than rand attempted to evade him
to have overtaken him at the distance
that lay between rand traveling as he
was would have taxed darrows horse
to the utmost so he held it down to
an even gallop and when he came to
the fork of the road took that spur of
it down which rand- had gone leading
away from the crescent moon

  though he was not unaware that he
rode into a zone of actual danger the
knowledge served only to strengthen
crescent moon



darrows purpose as did also the evi-
dent fact that rands persistent speed
meant an effort to avoid detention the
ride had become a definite pursuit upon
darrows part even when they
reached the boundaries of the snake
river range rand in no wise decreased
his speed darrow with no slacken-
ing of his purpose still followed in-
deed when rands big- horse showed
signs of flagging darrow gave rein
to his own and lessened the distance
that separated them by the time
rand had swung through the depres-
sion of the land where the road ran
through a woods of scrub oak and elms
and started up the slight ascent be-
yond at the top of which stood his
house darrow was but a few lengths
of his horse behind him

  on the plateau his house within
close view rand suddenly reined in
and swung around his face was not
pleasant to see as he turned upon leeds
darrow why have you followed
me he demanded

  darrows eyes shot points of bril-
liance in the subdued light of the octo-
ber afternoon to settle a score of
lifelong standing between us joel
rand to avenge the death of ken-
neth desmond to stop your being a
menace to better and cleaner lives to
clip the wings of your evil power

his answering word

j n the weighted silence that fell after

  darrows words only rands short-
ened and labored breathing could be
heard as he leaned heavily forward in
his saddle his eyes in a sort of fas-
cination bent upon darrows grim
face his lips dry and quivering
parted over his teeth but they uttered
no sound though his body trembled
until even his weight in the stirrups
could not prevent the shaking of his
legs

  darrow spoke again there are so
many things i have to say to you that
i hardly know at which end to begin
perhaps somewhere near the beginning
may be best is your memory good
do you recall that day of the big freshet
on the snake river when kenneth des-
mond was-what shall i say

  drowned panted rand he was
drowned 

  there are many ways and many
names for murder drowning is one
you say he was drowned but he
wasnt drowned

  drowned rand murmured thickly
he sank before my eytes

  darrow leaned forward over the
pommel of his saddle his body quiver-
ing with the restraint he put upon him-
self

  oh you are the murderer that you
believe you are he cried you let
him beg in vain for help the dropping
of the lariat about your saddle horn
would have saved him is your mem-
ory good rand do you remember
your answering words swim out if
you want to get out you called back
to him and watched him sucked under
and swirled away

  the electric shock of surprise stif-
fened rand an instant in his saddle

  how come you to know that he
cried

  then as if a physical support had
been suddenly withdrawn he crumbled
on his horse his mind too dazed to
grasp anything but the strange fact
of darrows utterance of those words
his body reeled limply to and fro but
there was no pity in darrows scorn

  how should i come to know he
demanded except that kenneth des-
mond did not drown but lived to tell
me his son

  slowly the circulation returned to
rands brain cells out of a stunned
collapse he came back to a dulled life
did not drown he echoed did
western story magazine

not drown then that was not his

body he is alive r

  no he is not-but i am darrow
waited he could see that the shock
of the disclosure had rendered rand

incapable of thought after some sec-
onds with rands eyes again resting
upon him he went on my father
looked me up and told me his story
before he died he never recovered
from the shock of that day and night
in the water i was but a boy then
joel rand but my mother had no cause
to love you and she never let me for-
get that story nor since i have been
living on the crescent moon have
you 

  so far darrow had spoken as one
might recite a well-rehearsed narration
but with his last words his manner
changed a sudden flame of contempt
and disgust and anger swept through
him there is small satisfaction in
calling so mean a thing as you are joel
rand the many names that fit you-
thief and tyrant browbeater of women
would-be murderer-and coward for
that goes with all of these but there
would be a vast satisfaction in making
you suffer and pay up for your long
immunity you have done your best to
harm me in many ways and i am going
to chase you body and bones off the
face of this particular part of the map
this ranch is miire not yours only
bear this well in mind if before you
leave here never to return i hear of
you trying any of your deviltry on any-
one-unless its your tool stalpas-if
i hear of you harming any one-ill
break every bone in your creeping body
as part of the vengeance i owe you for
what you did and for what you did not
do to my father

  rand had come back to life-the
dangerous life of the snake which feels
its coils are broken his narrowed
eyes burned hotly his laughter was
not unlike die deadly whistle of an
enraged serpent

  you talk fluently he sneered but
i knew your mother

  stinging across rands face fell the
curling lash of darrows quirt and the
white welt leaped from eye to chin
the cowboys own face was livid

  i will kill you for that leeds dar-
row whispered rand his teeth set
his eyes aflame but his trembling hands
holding fast to the pommel

  if you can said darrow ive no
doubt you will but if you try to do
so and dont succeed ill fill you so
full of lead that even your ghost will
rise no more of that i warn you
you have had me shot at you have
set your emissaries upon me in one
way and another if i shot you dead
now as you sit there it would be no-
more than you ridhly deserve fortu-
nately for you the law protects even
such vermin as you face about rand
and if you turn in your saddle until
you are well out of my sight well sec
if a long-distance bullet wont turn you
straight again as he spoke dar-
row drew his pistol and cocked it
now move on he commanded and
if you know whats good for you keep
moving

  muttering thickly in his throat rand
put his horse in motion until he was
lost to view beyond the house darrow
sat watching his receding figure then
lie too turned and rode off quickly
over the darkening plains toward the
lands of the crescent moon

chapter xix

across the years

cupper was over in the cabin of
 sour stalpas and when nanny
had cleared the table and spread over
it the red damask cloth her father pro-
ceeded to convert it into an armory
with a rifle a brace of shotguns sev-
eral revolvers and numerous hunting
knives boxes of cartridges and shells
canisters of shot and powder with all
crescent moon



the paraphernalia of loading he spread
over the surface of the table seated
himself and began to clean the bore of
one of the double-barreled shotguns

  can yuh help me nanny he asked
the girl who stood in the doorway
watching him ill wing yuh a goose
er two fore theyre all passed south
ill crimp yo catridges said
nanny i wont tech them oily rags
stalpas arranged before her the
empty cartridges and ammunition the
wads and implements put a couple
o logs on the fire he said  fore
ynxh sit down nanny a northers
blowed up an i aint as young as i
was

  the girl looked at him with a flash
of unusual interest as she went about
obeying his behest there had been
a difference in him lately he did not
seem to recover from the effect of the
beating darrow had administered
though his surliness had deepened he
did not so often now give it outward
expression in words or acts some-
thing sinister had come into his mo-
roseness

  aint yuh feelin well pa nanny
asked coming back to the table a hint
of affection in her voice

  i aint sick he returned gruffly
dont faze yoself all of a sudden
bout me nanny

  the girl was silent about the house
the rising wind whistled and drew the
flames of the wood fire up the chim-
ney in spite of her propensity to gad
about and gossip nanny stalpas did
not neglect her home and the room was
cozy in the warm glow

  i seen joel rand talkin tuh dandy
darrow this afternoon she presently
confided to her father they seemed
tuh be goin it hot an heavy

  sos you growled stalpas seizing
the cartridge she had loaded with its
charge of powder and was about to
wad in do yuh want me tuh blow
m head off dont do nothin if yuh

aint goin tuh do it right has it
come tuh havin tuh watch my own
daughter 

  law cried the girl tuh hear
you a bodyd think id put in a whole
keg give it tuh me powder aint

yuh see too much muttered stal-
pas emptying some of the powder from
the blank an yuh sure say a sight
too much more where was this
nanny

  nowhere answered nanny-sul-
lenly now i didnt see nothin so i
can say less

  yuhre a stubborn one said stal-
pas pleasantly and sighted down the
gleaming barrel of his gun toward the
firelight there was the sound of feet
outside and a knock at the closed door
whos that he cried

  better open it yoself suggested
nanny or i might see some mo and
stalpas got up moving heavily toward
the front door

  it was joel rand who entered shield-
ing his eyes from the light and shield-
ing the light from the swollen and vivid
scar that seamed his dark face i
want to speak with your father
nanny he said and my wife wants
you at the house i wish you would
go up there to her nanny rose her
sftiarp eyes had caught the angry welt
across rands face and lingered on it
curious and sagacious out with
you cried rand in sudden passion
meeting her keen scrutiny and stay
until i come to send you back do
you hear me go and nanny
went

  rand shot the bolt in the door be-
hind her then he turned to stalpas
took a step forward into the full light
and stood still pointing to the livid
scar do you see my face he cried
look at it once and for all so your
gloating eyes will keep away stalpas
hell die for this

  they looked squarely the one at the
western story magazine

 

other before rand turning sat down
heavily in the cowhide chair before the

fire

  something like a gleam of triumph
lighted the lowering face of stalpas
yuh cursed rue joel rand he said
slowly when he beat me an left me
fur dead did you let him go after
that without a blow

  he will die for this repeated
rand you understand stalpas

  stalpas took up and broke a revolver
letting the shells roll over the surface
of the table in the dead silence they
rattled ominously yes i under-
stand he muttered die as his father
died no doubt but i aint washin yo
dirty linen fur yuh no longer joel
rand after all yo hands is mo
practiced than mine an its you whose
precious conscience would sleep sweeter
fur his death

  rand had started violently you
know then he demanded giving
tongue to his surprise

  do yuh take me fur a fool clear
through asked stalpas fur what
other reason did yuh try tuh put him
in my place an then lie tuh me when
he wouldnt come yuh wanted him
here close under yo own lovin hand
an eye ive knowed that joel rand
fur some time what i dont under-
stand is how he knows

  knows what asked rand he
had shifted his eyes from the others
unflattering gaze

  knows you

  because said rand with a strange
quietness his father lived to tell him
stalpas put down the pistol he was
greasing looking straight before him
into vacancy his arm still outstretched
across the table so thats it he
murmured after a long silence yuh
aint a murderer after all then though
yuhd make me one but yuh aint
goin tuh do it joel rand he cried
with rising vehemence not because
i dont hate that leeds darrow or

whatever his name may be but because
i hate vuh wuss hate yuh a sight wusf

  rand spun around in the chair he
sat in astonishment too keen for ex-
pression held him dumb he had
thought he had this man bound fast by
the fetters of his fear and dependence
it was some time before he found
words stalpas he cried have
you gone crazy after all these years
you tell me that

  the foreman laughed harslily turn-
ing until his eyes met rands

  did yuh think i loved yuh joel
rand he asked with sarcasm crude
and biting did yuh rely think theres
been a day in all them years yuh speak
of that i didnt know yuhd ha potted
me quickern blazes if yuhd suspected
that i saw yuh the day yuh let kenneth
desmond go tuh his death beggin yuh
tuh save him an now yuh want me
tuh kill the son but i wont do it
not on yo wicked life i wont though
i may kill you if yuh drive me tuh it-
if yo tongue aint held tight tuh the
roof er yo mouth joel rand as yuh
told me onct tuh hole mine

  it was the old story of thieves falling
out in the little room the rising gale
whistling shrill- now about the corners
of the house the sharp chill of the
norther through all the fires warmth
the two men sat and glared with chal-
lenging eyes across the long years of
their guilty knowledge of each other

  youre a fiend stalpas breathed
rand

  then theres two said stalpas
you bein the other and again they
challenged each other in the stormy
silence

chapter xx

what the firelight saw

it was true that nanny stalpas had
found rands wife awaiting her
and with a feverish impatience which
at once impressed the girl with a sense
of impending trouble more and more
crescent moon



in her loneliness isabella rand had
learned to confide in to rely upon the
younger woman who in spite of her
sharp tongue was not without the gift
of sympathy

   dont know what has happened
nanny cried isabella when the girl
had explained her presence there but
my husband is in a terrible mood i
am used to his violence but to-night
there is something more awful in his
silence i am afraid nanny i am
afraid she wrung her hands fore-
going all pretense of self-restraint

  i know what has happened nanny
answered grimly him an dandy
darrow has had words an if i know
anythin of the mark of a quirt on hu-
man flesh joel rands had tuh eat some
of them words back him an pall
talk it out mis rand i wouldnt faze
myself about it 

  its the talking out that frightens
me nanny-im afraid of what theyll
do r

  law mis rand said nanny
they caint hurt one another aint
yuh never see a bull fight a ram mis
rand  they each knows the others
weak spots an all their fight mounts
tuh is lookin out tuh guard them spots
same way with a billy goat an a jack-
ass

  i was thinking of young darrow
safd the woman of what they may
do to him

  nanny laughed she was trying hard
to be her usual self  pears tuh me
theyd better be thinkin o what hell
do tuh them fur the nex turn

  but though she tried to comfort isa-
bella nanny stalpas felt her own con-
cern grow heavier within her she was
remembering the seething passions in
rands averted face their leaping in his
eyes as he turned them upon her she
recalled the brooding moroseness of her
fathers recent mood she thought of
that table strewn with deadly weapons
and she wished she had refused to

obey joel rands rough order to leave
the house

  if we could only stop that wind
cried isabella its as though it were
trying to keep us from hearing
doesnt it frighten you nanny

  it might admitted nanny if i
was tuh let it but whats the -wind got
tuh do with us why dont yuh go
tuh bed mis rand an let me read
tuh yuh yuhre that nervous an un-
strung praps yuhre hungry 

  hungry id choke if i tried to
eat to-night isabella paused listen-
ing a moment more she hesitated
nanny she cried at last suppose
you go back to your house id feel
better if you were there

  i dassent said the girl a tremor
chilling her at last he ordered me
tuh stay here till he came back he
was awful to-night mis rand
isabella sank into her diair read
to me nanny she begged anything
-it makes no difference what did
you ever think about marrying
nanny

  ive thought about not marryin
answered the girl from what ive
seen o men mis rand theres power-
ful few of em wuth swearin tuh love
honor and obey

  ah sighed the women its only
one of them that is hard to do nanny
-the honoring-but its the keystone
of the arch child did you hear a
step 

  its the shutter said the girl lis-
tening

  isabella sat back in her chair you
dont remember your mother nanny
nanny stalpas shook her head i
remember the fust mis rand though
she said after a time she used tuh
frighten me with her big eyes but she
was good tuh me it was the fust
mis rand who taught me how to sew
isabella rose from her chair in the
firelight her face was twisted and
drawn she moved about the room

with quick nervous steps how long
he takes she murmured as if to her-
self hut nanny caught the words i
wonder if you hadnt better go home
nanny perhaps hed come away if
you did

  she went to the window ami raised
the glass as she did so a gust of
wind blew out the lamp and finding
the open fireplace sent a shower of
ashes out upon the rug where nanny
sat fear now clutching undeterred at
her own heart isabella leaned far out
of the window

  scurrying clouds obscured the pale
half moon but by its light she could
make out the distant ranch houses
stilled by this time in slumber the
steady light tf the lamp in stalpas
cabin gleamed like a beacon across the
stretch of treeless land but even as
she watched it reassured its gleam
vanished suddenly as if puffed out

  with a quick cry isabella drew in
and turned to the girl something sin-
ister gripping her come with me
nanny she cried to the trembling girl
the light went out we must stop
them whatever they mean to do
hurry

  wait urged nanny he may be
cornin home an pa jest gone tuh bed
wait mis rand isabella waited
and the minutes passed and as they
passed her doubt and fear grew for
joel rand did not come

  they stole out of the house then
isabellas unaccustomed feet stumbling
on the uneven road once outside
nannys usual poise reasserted itself
in part we are fools tuh be scairt
so she said if theyve gone out
we caint follow if theys jes gone
intuh the kitchen tuh talk theyll curse
us fur cornin

  theyve not gone into the kitchen
whispered isabella her teeth clicking
why should they go into the kitchen
if theyve left that room they have gone
to get him-dandy darrow 

  but it was an even sterner fear that
momently grew in nanny stalpas
heart she became very quiet guiding

her companions steps quickly and
noiselessly until they stood within the
shadow of the foremans house there
they stopped and strained to catch a
sound from within where all was so
strangely silent

  about them the windswept plains
stretched in the unearthly glimmer of
the wan moonlight that sifted through
whirling clouds except for the whis-
tling of the wind there was no sound
nanny crept closer under the window
she fancied she could hear the crack-
ling of the flames inside but the wind
made this uncertain she tried to peer
through the window above her but it
was too high though on its glass she
could see the flickering light on the
hearth

  isabella stood beside her we came
too late she moaned they have
gone she took hold of nannys up-
lifted hand it was trembling and it
was as cold as death

  ill go in by the kitchen whis-
pered the girl you stay here

  trembling too her voice frozen isa-
bella followed the girl in the dark-
ened kitchen scarcely visible by the thin
light of the fire in the other room
which came through the crack under
the door nanny found the lamp and
lighted it with shaking fingers

  theyve gone isabella kept whis-
pering beside her theyve gone
nanny why do you stay here
something frightens me in this house

  nanny shook her head she seemed
unable to speak as the flame of the
lamp burned brighter she moved to
the door of the adjoining room and
started back as her hand reached out
to open it eyes wide and horrified at
the sight of what she saw at her feet
creeping under the crack isabella just
behind kept uttering her protest the
girl pushed open the door then stood
crescent moon



still her gaze following the shaking
illumination

  it was isabella who screamed aloud
in horror while from the girls nerve-
less fingers the lamp fell shattered to
the floor flickering and went out leav-
ing the firelight again to play grue-
somely over rand and stalpas clutched
in each others arms dead but bleeding
still from the murderous slashing of
the hunting knives still held in their
convulsed hands

chapter xxi

in the golden light

f ne morning when the hoarfrost
lay thick and sparkling over the
plains and the yellowr-breasted meadow
larks ran before their horses over the
frozen ground and the breath of those
horses spurted from their nostrils like
steam in the crisp air captain nora
and darrow were riding over the cres-
cent moon on their way out to the
winter ranges the frosty wind had
whipped a richer color into captain
noras cheeks and her eyes were bright
with abounding health and joy of life
and the happiness of the present hour

  yet there was a shadow on the girls
content which now and then lent a
wistfulness to her lips and deepened
the blue of her eyes to purple she had
learned of darrows parentage and of
the dangers he had run from joel
rands suspicious enmity with a puz-
zled wonder that he should remain a
cowboy on the crescent moon

  isabella after a long rest at noras
ranch had returned to her people and
nanny stalpas saddened and subdued
had joined the vane household but
darrow made no move to avail himself
of his possession of the snake bar
his conduct puzzled nora why she
wondered did he not resume his proper
name now that there wras no longer
any cause for his disguise

she put him an abrupt question

when will you be leaving me dandy 
i feel that i ought to call you mr des-
mond

  dont lie pleaded ive a right
to the name of darrow it was my
fathers mothers and i like it but
why should i be leaving you capn
nora didnt i tell you once that i
like my life here

  but said captain nora laughing
though not quite easily it seems sg
absurd for you to be working for wages
when you are independent of them
his smile was quizzical i am not
working for wages i am working for
pure love

  now strangely enough her laughter
was quite composed i am fortunate
to have so disinterested a man on my
pay roll she said

  he had by no means forgotten the
night they had talked together after his
imprisonment before he could speak
to her of his love however there was
another thing he must tell her-that
which had been his lifelong shame and
humiliation the heritage he should
bring to the woman he loved and to
his children and he feared to tell this
thing to captain nora lest it weigh
against him in the balance

  they were alone on the wide stretch
of prairie the tang of the clean cold
day in their faces they rode with
frequent lapses into silence-the silence
that fuses and binds into a glowing
whole the incomplete mosaic of speech
yet always there lay between them felt
by each incomprehensible to the girl
that halting reticence upon darrows
part

  then unconsciously nora touched
the hidden spring of that invisible but
palpable barrier you have never told
me dandy what it was that brought
your father first to snake river

  he shrank perceptibly it was on
my mind to do so to-day he said look-
ing away as he spoke suddenly he
lifted his head and turned to her it
western story magazine

was a wrecked and ruined life capn
nora he loved the wrong woman-

and she was my motherp

  ah she cried swift pity hushing
her voice i should not have asked
you that forgive me dandy

  but now he wanted to speak for the
moment had come yes he said i
had to tell you that capn nora do
you remember that i told you once that
day we had our lunch together in the
millet field that i did not belong to
the well-ordered ways of life i do
not know what you think of such things
-rather i know what you must think
born as you have been reared as you
have been living as you have lived i
told you i was born in vagabondia
she was very quiet looking down
at the ground before them her face
grave and troubled it sent a pang
of bitterness to darrows heart he
could not see that her lowered eyes
swam with warm tears or guess that
her heart ached for him with a touch
of that universal mother love a woman
does not have to be a mother to know

  and now you understand he went
on a curious calmness in his tones
why i have not spoken of this before
knowing all the time that speak of it
i must do you know why

  swift color flooded her face though
she met his gaze clear-eyed and un-
flinching when he spoke again

  because i loved you though i
fought hard to keep from telling you
so because with every day that has

passed i have loved you more be-
cause i have dared to hope that some
day i might w-in your love do you

see why

  she saw-in spite of the tears that
made the golden splendor of the day
about them a swimming blur of light
in her eyes-saw with a tumultuous
leaping of joy in her heart which she
would not let him see-yet so she
was silent

  they had reached the spot where
their way turned eastward down to the
sheltered wooded lands where the cres-
cent moon herds picked their winter
herbage in a little while they would
reach the men who had ridden out
ahead of them darrow drew rein
stopping his horse at the verge of the
plateau

  capn nora he asked can you
forgive me the sins of my parents
can you love me and be my wife not
because i love you little but because i
love you much i will go away out of
your life if you tell me no

  just an instant she held him waiting
while her eyes looked fearlessly into
his owm

  then the light of my own life would
go out she said for i have loved
you long for what i have known you
to be-yourself and a man

  ah he cried and a glad joy lifted
his voice and he wheeled his horse
close beside hers htwr i have tor-
tured myself with doubts nora cap-
tain nora my nora creina

of the adobe shack
which temporarily housed

mounting he stalked
stiffly inside

 what do you think i heard when

cealed amusement red was one of
those unfortunates to whom something
is always happening

ning soothingly interposed youre

  the diminutive ranger grinned at his
sergeant rather sheepishly then his
thoughts reverting to the cause of his
exasperation he broke forth into violet
eruption

rojas he fumed my trigger finger

  two weeks later a broiling sun beat
torridly down into a slight depression
which had once been the bed of a river
a half mile to the north a thin shim-
mering silvery streak marked the course
of the rio grande years past in
obedience to some freakish whim the
stream hadforsaken its course and eaten
its way north into the land of the gringo
two stone monuments placed some dis-
tance apart in the exact center of the
ancient river bed marked the present
boundary line between the united states
and mexico

  within the gentle hollow where cen-
turies of rushing water had packed the
sand as smooth as silk surged two
sweating cheering lines of race-crazed
humanity as though actuated by the
mutual wish to stay each in their own
country the southern line was com-

posed of dark-skinned mexicans the
northern by wide-hatted high-booted
texans grouped compactly together
on the northern side close to the finish-
ing line stood a small knot of men-
texas rangers

  down ihe center of the lane formed
by the parallel lines thundered two
horses one a dun one a sorrel

  priesa enearnado neue-hasten
red baby-the raucous insistent yell
came from yellow throats telling to the
world upon which horse the bulk of the
mexican money was wagered

  in truth the red baby was hastening
he was running bravely courageously
drawing on every last ounce of his re-
serve strength overweighted poorly
ridden the colt-and he was barely past
three-was striving valiantly to hold the
slight lead he had gained

  his rider a swarthy mexican whose
evil features were distorted with a de-
sire to win cruelly belabored the colt
pounding along a scant length behind
came the dun crouched low on his
back a diminutive youth held the
heady animal under double wraps red
was content to let his rival make the
pace

  as the scudding pair race-crazed
hurtled into the last quarter the duns
rider raised in his shortened stirrups
loosening the wraps from about his
wrists he leaned over and spoke sharply
into the laid-back yellow ears like a
golden skyrocket the dun shot forward
closing the intervening gap

  when the yellow head forged past
him the mexican threw one startled
look behind then in a sudden blind
access of fury withdrew both feet from
his stirrups thrusting forward his
legs with his long-shanked sharp-
roweled spanish spurs he raked the colt

slabs with convulsive lunging jumps
in a vain endeavor to run out from
under those piercing cutting instru-
ments of torture

  for the fourth time his rider thrust
forward his spurred heels-then the colt
rebelled possibly the injustice of the
act registering in his equine brain un-
leashed a trait inherent from a line of
spanish forbears setting his feet the
sorrel slid to a dead stop hung his
head knotted his back and started to
pitch straight down the course he
jumped all thoughts of the race aban-
doned intent only oil ridding himself of
that stabbing demon on his back

  fanned to his work by the wildly
waved hats and the cries of pure glee
that arose from the northern side of the
lane amid the vile execrations and mut-
tered curses of the dark-skinned men on
the southern side the sorrel unlimbered
an exhibition of straight and fancy
bucking calculated to jar loose his riders
back teeth

  encouraged by the shrill crys of
ride him cowboy hang to him
hombre the mexican gripped the sad-
dles horn until his knuckles showed
white beneath his yellow skin there
he stuck-stuck for two jumps-then
landed in an ignominious heap on the
tight-packed sand

  as the colt pitched down the track
the spectators oblivious of all boundary
lines melted together into an arguing
jumbled crowd forcing a way through
the throng headed toward the little knot
of rangers who still hung together near
the finishing line came the dun horse
and rider

  a broad grin showed itself on the
riders face old duns rabbit foot is
still working he joyfully announced
but im cured plumb cured that sor-
rel like to give me the heart disease
the way he jumped into the lead i
held the idea for a few seconds that old
dun was due to spend the balance of
his days packing a certain greaser

around mexico he would have to if
the sorrel had a little more age and
experience behind him

  tip nodded slow agreement the
stallions the best horse all right he
said all he needs is a little more
age and experience as you say we
were lucky rojas got anxious and over-
played his hand

  you-all better go on over and col-
lect your hoss red advised as he slid
from the duns back last i seen the
greasers had a rope on the stallion and
if you dont show up soon theyre liable
to start some monkey business thats
a sore crowd of cholas those cow-
boys have cleaned them of every last
peso they possessed rojas is the sorest
of the lot barring the man who rode the
stallion

  barely had the words left reds
mouth when from the opposite edge of
the crowd arose a shrill neighing which
gradually merged into the shriek of a
horse in mortal agony

  tossing the duns reins to a by-
stander the diminutive redhead shoved
an elbow into his sergeants midriff
get a move on he commanded
sounds to me like they have started
some devils work already you cant
trust that rojas as far as you can
throw a bull by the tail

  instantly the piercing screams of the
horse which rose more and more in-
sistent drew the little group of rangers
through the crowd

  red magraw had guessed rightly
the sight which met their eyes as they
drew to the opposite edge of the crowd
caused each ranger to reach for his
gun in a concentrated swirl of furv
outstretched held down by tightly
drawn reatas the red colt lav prone
upon the ground suffering a torment of
anguish yellow hands entwined in the
helpless sorrels tail his erstwhile rider
was applying with all his strength that
exquisite method of torture knowm as
cola torccdura-tail twisting


western story magazine

  the red stallions one-time rider was
applying it scientifically and with pains-
taking care it appeared that he would
wrench loose the backbone tear the
spinal column itself from the helpless
animal close by his head gazing un-
moved into the suffering eyes of the
tortured stallion rojas directed opera-
tions

  for a moment a red film of wrath
obscured tip lannings sight a passion
to kill surged over him then the mists
rolled away and his voice came forth
cool deadly implacable

  stop rojas he barked let that
hoss up

  come an get heem senor rojas
taunted an evil smile twisting his face
come and get thees fine red caballo
you have won however if the senor
does not care to come i myself will
deliver him-after i have finish thees
leetle job wheech i do

  rojas was familiar with that paragraph
in the regulations which forbade a
ranger to cross the dividing line of
the two countries and the sorrel lay
his head barely over the line on the soil
of mexico

  with a furtive glance at the monu-
ments which marked the dividing line
tip noted the fact and his heart took
a little sickening slide downward but
his active brain searching for a way
out of the dilemma registered a fact
which had escaped the mexicans at-
tention as rojas had turned to bait
the ranger he had unwittingly stepped
a pace or two forward he was now
across the line on american soil

  coolly tip measured the distance then
with a terrific bound gained the mexi-
cans side rojas with a snarl reached
toward his gun back senor he
commanded thees ees the soil of
mexico

  mexico-hell  exclaimed the ranger
disdaining the use of his own pistol
with a whiplike motion he grasped
rojas gun arm with a savage twist

he wrenched the pistol from rojas

grasp and tossed it contemptuously
across the line keep the rest of them
quiet tip directed ill tend to this
hombre

  now greaser tell your comjtadres to
get that colt on his feet and start him
across the line tip enforced the
command with a bone-crunching twist
of the arm pain and fear showed in
rojas face pronto insisted the
ranger before i shove your carcass
down below where it belongs

  racked with ageffff beset with terror
in a croaking voice rojas abjectly gave
the order the colt was allowed to re-
gain his feet and was led across the line
with a mighty jerk tip dragged rojas
upright and faced him toward mexico

  rojas he said i have always har-
bored the impression you were a di ey
crook now i know it i am going to
send you back home and i am going
to give you a present to remember me
by

  raising a booted foot tip propelled
the mexican into his native land where
he sprawled in an unsightly heap

  slowly rojas regained his feet picked
up his pistol and with a muttered im-
precation hobbled away to seek solace
with those of his own ilk

  it was late afternoon the low-hang-
ing sun bathed the prairie in a flickering
red light tip lanning following a
faintly defined trail was riding slowly
into the waning sunset his clothes
likewise the red coat of his horse were
splotched and coated with white alkali
dust his chaps and short canvas jacket
were tied behind the cantle of his sad-
dle in some manner the thongs which
fastened the compactly rolled bundle be-
came unloosened and unseen and un-
heard by the rider the pack thudded to
the ground

  unconscious of his loss his head
the horse and the man



bowecl in contemplative silence tip rode
steadily forward his horse respon-
sive to his mood plodded onward never
leaving the trail the horse was near-
ing feed and water and he knew it
lifting his head he gave the faintest
of faint nickers and insensibly increased
his pace

  his rider roused up and let his eyes
wander across the prairie in the fore-
ground sprawled a small cluster of
weather-beaten houses a typical prairie
town far beyond wrapped in a faint
luminous haze but bulking gigantic in
their sheer immensity loomed an enor-
mous range of hills

  tip leaning forward patted the
horses dust-grimed neck lovingly

  talk to them red devil he said
you aint the only one thats impa-
tient for something to eat

  from down the trail where he had
but recently passed came the pound
of hoofs heralding the approach of
rapidly advancing riders true to the
etiquette of the plainsman tip did not
glance around until the riders were
abreast as he half turned in his sad-
dle a sharp hands up smote his
ears and he gazed square into an an-
cient but formidable-looking 

  tip elevated his hands deliberately
never changing his expression by as
much as a flicker

  kind of sudden aint you he
casually inquired of the individual be-
hind the gun

  have to be with gentlemen of your
stamp ironically returned his captor
who sported a large and ornate star
unlimber him boys he directed ad-
dressing the other members of the
posse

  a rapid search disclosed an automatic
of interesting caliber nestled beneath
tips left arm that and the win-
chester in his saddle sheath comprised
his armament

  you cau put your hands down now
the sheriff said ride straight ahead

well tell you when to turn dont try
to bolt or dont try any funny work
unless youre aimin to resemble a first-
class sieve ready forward march 
tip began to expostulate but the
sheriff refused to listen

  you can talk later on take a fools
advice and hike it

  the cavalcade led by tip started and
eventually wound up at a small one-
story jail near the towns outskirts

  make yourself at home sardoni-
cally remarked the sheriff as he escorted
his prisoner inside shes all yours
for a week or so-anyway

  say requested tip as the sheriff
prepared to leave would you mind
coming out of your shell long enough
to inform me what this is all aboui

  beats my time how plumb innocent
every hoss thief is plaintively re-
marked the sheriff and ignoring tips
request clanged the door behind him
presently he reappeared and thrust a
poster through the bars read this 
he said it may refresh your memory
a trifle this rustling circle a hosses
has got to stop

  sitting down on the cot tip scanned
the paper

five hundred dollars
reward

  the above sum will he paid for the appre-
hension of one known as big blondv six
feet in height blond complexion with blue
eyes and of muscular build will undoubt-
edly be riding a red sorrel horse branded
circle a and stolen from that outfit he
is thought to be making for the llano
mountains to join the dave dillsworth gang
who are hiding in that vicinity if arrested
notify the undersigned

f biggars sheriff of driscoll county

  tip read the poster and at the con-
clusion an amused smile hovered around
his lips describes me all right but
sheriff your dead-wrong youve uot
your wires crossed he said then in
a few concise sentences tip explained
who he was and also the errand which
called him in that vicinity
s

western story magazine

  in impassive silence the sheriff lis-
tened to the explanation tip reached
for his jacket pocket then suddenly
remembering the bundle tied on the back
of his saddle said my credentials are
in my coat which is tied behind the
cantle go on out and get them and
well both go to supper

  the sheriff gazed at his prisoner
doubtfully then as if willing to give
him the benefit of any doubt turned
away in a short space he reappeared

  son he said between a liar and
a hoss thief id pick a hoss thief every
time you appear to be both youll
stay here till they send for you and in
the meantime thank your lucky star that
somebody didnt catch you and string
you before i got on your trail ill
bring you somethin to eat in the
mornin a little righteous hunger may
help that lyin soul of yours

iv

  some time after midnight tip was
awakened by a handful of gravel which
tossed through the window fell with
unerring aim upon the cot throwing
off the blankets he sat upright

  that you blondy the question
came in a sibilant whisper from the out-
side tip gazed uncomprehendingly
then ent to the window and peered out
within the shadow of the jail faintiy
outlined in the dim starlight stood a
roughly dressed individual and behind
him were two horses

  a faint whinny answered tips soft
whistle yeh i got your hoss here
blondy a hoarse whisper assured
him i also got a good bar i reckon
in about two jerks we can be headed
away from this burg provided you aint
too big to squeeze through the window
tip did some quick thinking his brain
revolving in swift whirls here un-
doubtedly was auother case of mistaken
identity but at the same time it was in
his favor he quickly weighed the pos-

sibility of being able to convince the
sheriff of his identity against the
prospect of an immediate exit his mis-
sion being pressing and the chances of
his release the next day being slight he
decided to embrace the opportunity at
hand at some later date he would
right matters lets go he whispered
in reply came the entrance of the bar
between the gratings and the sound of
cautious pryings one by one the bars
gave pulling out of the rotted masonry
in which they were imbedded

  try it now came the croaked com-
mand in compliance tip drew himself
up and after tight squeezing and sundry
wrigglings dropped lightly to the
ground outside

  well be movin now blondy we
ought to be into the hills come day-
light with an assenting nod and a
sly stolen pat for the sorrel tip fol-
lowed his rescuers example silently and
swung himself into the saddle

  as they picked their way through
town tip studied his rescuer with
shrewdly appraising eyes of medium
height dressed in typical cowboy regaha
several weeks growth of beard hid a
weak placid mouth his eyes were fur-
tive and shifty containing none of the
cold hard glint that marks the killer

  a weak sister surmised tip tool
for some gang most likely aloud he
said im sure in your debt for get-
ting me out of that jug but howcome
anyway 

  the stranger gave a low throaty
chuckle heard in town theyd caught
you and knowing something about that
jail i stuck around to get you out dave
is short-handed and will be mighty glad
to get another hand especially one like
you

  tip digested this information slowly
then chanced another question how
is it you dare hang around town  i
supposed dave dillsworths outfit had
to keep mighty shady

again the stranger voiced his throaty
the horse and the man



chuckle i dont exactly belong-that
is not yet he said im working for
the circle a outfit looking after a bunch
of horses they are summering iback in
the hills when dave pulls the big deal
off i figure on leaving with him
just what big deal is dave plan-
ning now tip pressed his whiskered
companion

  theres such a thing as talking too
much the bearded one bluntly in-
formed him closing his mouth with a
sudden snap ill take you to dave
like i said i would then its up to
him and he lapsed into an impenetrable
silence

  several hours afterward the pair ap-
proached a small shack cleverly con-
cealed in a canon among the hills
around an open fire squatted several
hard-bitted figures feel pretty se-
cure thought tip they must have
plenty of guards out and we just about
dodged them

  as they drew near a man detached
himself from the group and came for-
ward thats dave tips guide in-
formed him in an undertone then
raising his voice he addressed the leader
of the band

  this heres big blondv i picked
him up in town

  dave dillsworth burly and broad
brutal of face pitiless of mouth with
eyes that glowered suspicion studied
tip then turned and narrowly observed
his horse

  whered you get that sorrel  he
asked looks mighty like one i rus-
tled into mexico some time back
youre plumb mistaken tip lied
with sublime audacity i stole this here
boss when i was making my get-away
the one i was ridin give down on me
forewith he plunged into a fictitious
tale of his former exploits

  dave listened to the wordy disserta-
tion in silence at the finish he grunted
again unamiably as if only half con-
vinced

 d-w

  we dont need you he informed
tip but youll have to stay till the big
chief gets here he may cut you in
but i aint taking any hances

  for the next few days tip loafed
about endeavoring to ingratiate himself
with the members of the band a
strained intensity hung like a pall over
the camp without doubt a big coup
was to be pulled very soon gathering
scraps of conversation here catching
a softly dropped word there tip was at
last able to piece together their plans

  the circle a by whom his bearded
guide was employed was a horse out-
fit engaged in breeding blooded horses
exclusively they were summering a
good-sized bunch in the hills dave
dillsworth proposed to steal the entire
string the scheme had been evolved
in the fertile brain of the one known
as big chief he tip gathered lived
south of the border and had for some
time been disposing of stolen horses
small bunches which dave had rustled
and driven down to him now acting
in conjunction they were in for a grand
clean-up their scheme was subtile
and by its very daring bade fair to prove
effective

  representing himself as a horse
buyer who had purchased a big string
of circle a horses the big chief was to
order a train of stock cars set for a cer-
tain date at gopher a small loading
station on the opposite side of the hills
when placing the order he would be
accompanied by tips bearded guide to
give credence to his claim and quiet
any suspicion the train was to be
billed to san antonio at a junction
some hundred and fifty miles south the
train was to be stopped and the horses
unloaded from there it was a scant
three hours drive across country to the
border and safety

  in order to further insure their plans
and nullify any chance of discovery
while rustling the horses still further
distractions had been contrived sev-

era of the band heavily armed and well
mounted were to make their way into
the small town where tip had been
held in jail

  here they were to stage a fake or
if things broke advantageously a gen-
uine holdup of the bank it was a
foregone conclusion that the news would
be carried posthaste to the nearer
ranches with the request of their riders
services for posse work thus all the
outfits would be drawn into town and
there would be small chance of the
rustlers being interrupted

  as tip cogitated the daring plan his
mind constantly harked back to the chain
of circumstances that had pitchforked
him into the midst of the band thus
far luck had ridden at his right hand
on detached duty his very mission was
to investigate the activities of the gang
of which now perforce he was a mem-
ber

  by a strange turn of fortunes wheel
he possessed all the requisite informa-
tion but how he could make use of it
he could not for his life conjecture he
was still plainly under the suspicion of
the leader dave and was unarmed
even had he been armed it was pal-
pably impossible for any one man to ar-
rest the band single-handed review-
ing the situation from all angles tip
decided his best chance providing he
could gain the outlaws full confidence
would be with the party who were to
hold up the bank he was satisfied that
in some manner to be determined by
circumstances he could frustrate the at-
tempt and cause the raiders capture
then being conversant with their plans
it would be an easy matter to form a
posse and capture the balance of the
gang while they were loading the
horses

  what bothered tip unduly was the
identity of the big chief the unknown
head that he was some desperate
character from the lower border tip
was convinced and therein lay the

danger the ranger was well known
along both sides of the line here bet-
ter titan a hundred miles north he was
a comparative stranger and in lit-
danger of being recognized but there
was hardly a criminal or outlaw along
the border but knew and feared the in-
trepid ranger

   well it was all in the line of duty
and a chance one had to take thought
tip

   having thus settled things in his own
mind he philosophically awaited the big
chiefs coming

v

  several days passed and tip his
nerves attuned to catch the slightest
change subtly sensed an undertone of
excitement running through the camp
there was a strained sense of anticipa-
tion the comings and goings increased
and dave held many low-voiced con-
versions with different members of
the band

  toward evening tip engaged in
brushing red devil who was staked
some little distance away from the bal-
ance of the horses noted a compact
bunch of riders coming up the ravine
one was a stranger at a distance tip
could not distinguish his features but
there was something vaguely familiar in
the way the figure dismounted from his
horse and stalked into the shack

  tip knotted his brows in perplexity
searching the corridors of his memory
as he pondered striving to place the
figure dave stepped forth from the
shack and beckoned tip made his way
slowly toward the hut

  this is where the show-down
comes he thought if i can only
persuade them to let me go with the
band into town the rest will be easy

  in contrast to the glaring sunlight
without the interior of the shack held
all the murkiness of a tomb for a
moment tip failed to recognize the new-
comer then as his eyes became ac-
the horse and the man



customed to the dimness he received
the full impact of rojas sinister smile
the big chief was no less than his
ancient enemy-the captain of the
rurales

  involuntarily tips muscles tensed
and stiffened the mexican rose to his
feet with a mock gesture of welcome

  eet is the senor tip he said
leetle did i dream i would meet so
much old friends-companeros-in dees
countree he waved a pistol negli-
gently toward tfhe ranger and continued
with an evil smirk how is the red
caballo the senor has instilled some
courage into hees dogs heart by thees
time i hope

  then his sarcastic suaveness changed
to the fierce intensity of a caged tiger

  eet is now rojas turn he snarled
many times will you pay for the vile
insult of the keeck but not now-
manana by that time maybe i will
have theenk of some good way to repay
my friend-my companero

  acting under rojas instructions
dave bound the ranger and rolled him
outside here tip spent an uncom-
fortable night dave had trussed him
cunningly and skillfully a few vain
efforts convinced tip that it was use-
less to try and escape from the tightly
drawn bonds he mentally cursed the
impulse which caused him to refrain
from putting up a fight when he first
recognized rojas-settling matters then
and there that rojas would mete out
nothing less than death to him on the
morrow was a certainty and he shud-
dered to think of the tortures he would
have to undergo before that death came
if rojas had not meant to play with
him catlike he would have killed him
at once without compunction with the
ingrained philosophy that was a part
of his nature tip accepted the cards
which fate had dealt him attempting
not to think of what the morrow would
bring forth

  bright and early the following morn-
ing the camp was astir under dave i
direction the outlaws split into two
parties dave had elected to go with
the bank robbers and rojas was to
oversee the loading of the rustled stock

  from where he lay tip watched both
bands depart a faint spasm of hope
surged through his heart was it pos-
sible that rojas had given up his cher-
ished thought of revenge that was
almost too much to expect tip was
not kept long on the anxious seat
presently rojas returned riding alone
evidently he wished no one to witness
his revenge

  dismounting he strode to where tip
lay helpless and unbound his legs get
up gringo he said rojas ees about
to do you a great honor here he
prodded tip with his foot

  painfully his legs numbed and
bruised the results of the tightly drawrn
cords the ranger struggled to his feet

  emphasizing the order with a flour-
ished pistol the mexican commanded
forward march with vicious prods
of the gun he steered tip toward the
mouth of the canon while keeping up
a running fire of vituperation

  the senor feels like the fast run
thees morning rojas maliciously in-
quired yes eet is good soon will
he have the chance the senor is doubt-
less familiar with the law of my land
wheech allow the fugitive to eescape-
eef he can-by making a run the
senor will now have a chance to test
thees law in hees own countree you
are my preesinor seiior i wish to take
you back to mexico you do not weesh
to go senor you weesh to escape ees
it plain now

  as the full meaning of the mexicans
intent sunk into tips brain he could
not repress an involuntary shudder
this was repayment with a vengeance
this invoking of the ancient spanish
fugitive law-ley fugitivo what chance
would he have to escape the mexicans
western story magazine

bullets while running down a narrow
canon 

  and if he did escape kojas would
mount his horse and hunt him down
like a dog well one sure thing-he
wouldnt run a lick let the greaser
shoot him down where he stood

  rojas croaking voice broke into his
meditations and one theeng more
senor rojas ees tender-hearted rojas
weeshes to give you much pleasure be-
fore you die perhaps the senor would
care to bid hees red caballo a good-by
-adios eet has been tole me senor
you can wheestle and the red one will
come rojas in hees great goodness will
allow you to call the red horse and
bid him a long farewell

  the taunting words piercing tips
brain set a train of thought in motion
here might lay a chance for a desperate
attempt to escape little did the mexi-
can realize the depths of the love and
obedience rendered the ranger by the
red stallion he would whistle up red
devil and strive to gain his back there
was a bare chance it might be done and
even a barer chance he might escape
anyway it wouild be better than being
butchered or shot down running away
like a rabbit

  tip whistled shrilly

  the sorrel which was grazing some
little distance off raised his head and
located the sound once again tip
whistled with a nicker of delight the
red stallion trotted slowly forward

  as he neared the pair in sheer joy-
ous abandon he started to weave a
flirtatious circle about them when he
passed the mexican who pistol trained
upon the ranger was paying slight heed
to the horses antics the stallion stopped
-stopped dead

  possibly some taint in the air con-
veyed to his sensitive nostrils the pres-
ence of a hated greaser it may have
been that in rojas he recognized his
former tormentor then again it may
have been a blind wrath the uncontrol-

lable impulse which causes a stallion at
times to attack strangers w hen the
stallion stopped he raised one foot cau-
tiously placed it gently on the ground
raised the other and took a step for-
ward in the manner of a bird dog road-
ing game

  then he charged-charged like a red
thunderbolt from hell in two leap-
ing plunging bounds he was on top of
the mexican like the suapping of a
gigantic trap the jaws closed-closed
over the arm that held the gun shriek-
ing horrible screams of pain and fear
the mexican with futile efforts fought
the rage-crazed beast as well might
he have fought a bolt of lightning
wheeling plunging kicking snapping
fury incarnate the red horse beat rojas
to the ground only when his victim
lay a broken crumpled sodden heap
did the stallion desist then raising
high his head he shrilled to the world
his clarion call of defiance as the
shrill cry died away he turned trotted
slowly over to his master and rubbed
his red muzzle affectionately up and
down his shoulder

  hours afterward tip rode into the
town which a short time before had suc-
cessfully repelled a foray on its bank in
front of him on his horse he bore
the limp body of the mexican sliding
stiffly down tip eased the inert figure
to the ground he was quickly sur-
rounded by a curious crowd while
willing hands came to his assistance tie
poured out the plans of the rustlers

  then one of tue crowd spoke once
on the border he said oracularly i
saw a horse run a brave game race and
lose after the race i saw his owner
compliment him by trying to kill him
this is the horse and this prodding
the mexican with his foot is the man
am i not right he turned to tip

  you are the ranger gravely ac-
quiesced and just this morning red
devil returned the compliment

came to cinnabar prospect lambert
could hobble around on crutches but he
couldnt face the hard journey to morse
city there were others who would
gladly have gone to collect that five
hundred dollars from abe tarte but
lambert didnt feel sure that any old
gun fighter eager to get his long-
quiescent forty-five into action would
not claim a large percentage as collec-
tion fees and put it back into circulation
in morse city via tartes cash drawer
so montagne was sent

  while jarvis had a lively brain a
slant for constructive work and a pow-
erful frame yet some perverse quirk in
his brain had kept him for five years
selling groceries overalls saddles
ropes spurs and tools to cattlemen and
miners
western story magazine

  but now even as he threw up his
head and swung his glance to cake in
the stark lofty mountain ranges on
either hand and a flat sajy desert
ahead his spirit felt free and he talked
to himself go back to old lambert
and measure out tea to the miners and
tit old sour doughs with overalls not
any more for jarvis montagne 

  for men are smitten as suddenly as
that sometimes alone in the great
desert emptiness peopled with its own
silent mysterious life with a good horse
under him and the trail ahead looking
as though it were going on and on over
the edge of the world jarvis won-
dered how he could ever have spent
every day within four walls

  from the top of a sand ridge five
miles from cinnabar prospect he
glanced back the tiny town clung to
a low foothill slope which rose from
the level desert floor

  two dozen wooden boxes squatting
in the sand  and ive been spending all
my days in one and nights in another
he grumbled then his broncho stepped
down the farther slope of the ridge and
his home town was blotted from his
sight i can take old ruel back his
five hundred dollars if i get it he
reflected and then mr ruel lambert
gets my resignation as manager office
boy and general factotum of the cin-
nabar emporium having come to
this revolutionary decision he brought
his quirt down with a swish and his
broncho broke into a run

  montagne possessed one of those ex-
ceptional physiques that remain ever
supple and ready to respond to an un-
usual call and he had ridden home with
the first flight in many a stiff cross-
country run back east so when he rode
into morse city in the late afternoon all
he experienced was an added sense of
exhilaration

  he left his pouv at the livery stable
and registered at the hotel which an-
nounced itself as the palace although

it was but a one-story dobe built around
a central court in spanish fashion
then he walked along the one street of
rock and hard-beaten earth to the morse
city amusement company entered
and a iked for mr tarte it was early
supper time and montagne found the
big room empty but for a saloon hang-
er-on left in charge while the propri-
etor dined

   tartes at jo huis the chinks fillin
up-be back in an hour said the watch-
dog taking in the clean-cut young stran-
ger curiously

  montagne left to get his own sup-
per and being very much on the job
was back within the hour the barnlike
amusement room bore a different air
several card games were going at tables
ranged along the walls pool balls
clicked from a big back room and the
bar was veil lined with men while a
phonograph wailed and squeaked from
a corner

  montagne waited at the end of the
bar until a large pale man having fin-
ished serving the thirsty crowd turned
toward him inquiringly where can
i find mr tarte asked jarvis

  youre lookin right at him an-
swered the bartender his features
were heavy his face was very pallid
and his eyes were a dead black small
and restless

  id like to see you alone for a few
minutes mr tarte whenyou can spare
the time jarvis eyes were bright his
color was high and he had somehow
shed his careful manner

  all right said tarte looking at him
speculatively ill be through with this
bunch in a minute have a drink
and jarvis without a moments hesita-
tion answered sure

  while montagne tossed off a stiff
drink of raw whisky a young fellow
leaning negligently against the wall and
smoking a cigarette grinned sardoni-
cally at jarvis montagues back this
fellow was the terrible example of cin-
a running account



nabar and he had recognized the model
youth from the same town actin
natural away from home he said to
himself

  in a few minutes tarte walked to the
end of the bar where his visitor waited
wiped his hands on a bar towel and
nodded toward a narrow door beside
the bar

  montagne followed the saloon keeper
through it into a small room fitted with
a flat-topped desk several chairs and
a smoky hanging lamp

  sit down stranger tarte waved
his visitor to a chair seated himself at
his desk and pushed forward a box of
cigars montagne lighted one blew
smoke at the lamp and then turned to
his host

  mr tarte im from ruel lambert
of cinnabar

  yeh asked tarte

  you know wre have a bill against
you of more than five hundred dollars
and as mr lambert could get no reply
to any of his letters and couldnt make
the trip himself im here for him you
know that bill is long overdue mr
tarte

  lamberts been sendin me frantic
letters about it for most three years i
reckon said tarte

  well asked montagne

  an since them goods was bought
cinnabars went dry but morse citys
stayed wet an so how can old lam-
bert bein dry figure on livin off the
proceeds of a wet business queried
tarte

  jarvis smiled still mr tarte you
must admit its both a moral and a busi-
ness obligation

  no i dont-an it aint growled
the saloon man lambert sold me liq-
uor then he turns round an works tooth
an nail to make the whole country dry
tried to dry up morse city too-wrould
a ruined me-but he couldnt make it
hes got to pay that much fer his damn
dry principles

  montagne studied the unscrupulous
face for a moment isnt there any
way i can make you see that this was
a business obligation no matter what
came after

  no there aint young feller but ill
tell yer what i will do ill put up a
thousand agin your five hundred to see
whether i pay that bill or call it off

  jarvis looked dubious then laughed
recklessly all right ive got five
hundred dollars of m own here im
trampling on all my good resolutions
but ill go you tarte only one con-
dition though put the cash on the
table

  tarte smiled craftily sure ill do
that

  shall we settle it here asked mon-
tagne

  no come outside to one o the
tables said tarte he was all eager-
ness now and hustled his visitor out
into the noisy saloon and to an unoccu-
pied table he went to his safe and
pulled out a bag of gold from which
he counted a thousand dollars jarvis
pulled a roll of bills from his pocket
counted out five hundred dollars and
put it with the pile of eagles and double
eagles then tarte broke a fresh pack
of cards and the play began

  the tall lean young fellow with the
reckless face who still leaned negli-
gently against the wall looked on with
indifferent interest his right hand was
hooked in his gun belt his left held a
fresh cigarette

  presently the play ended abruptly
and tarte looked up a triumphant
gleam in his black eyes cant beat
four aces can yer young feller

 why-why stammered jarvis
how can that be i have an ace in my
hand a flush rose in tartes pale
cheeks his black eyes roved about the
room and his hand stole inside his vest

  drop it came from the indolent
one against the wall

  tarte drew out his hand empty for


western story magazine

he knew that careless-seeming young
man was deadly swift on the draw

  vance chester stepped up to the table
deliberately picked up three or four
cards lying in front of the saloon keeper
and fingered the backs delicately with
his left hand then he smiled youd
orter be careful abe when you mark
a deck was that other ace up yer
sleeve 

  tarte glared at him without speak-
ing there was no shame in his look
only malevolence and chagrin mon-
tagne an angry glint in his eyes kicked
his chair back and stood up ranging
himself beside vance chester the inter-
fering one he encountered faces as
ugly and unscruplous as tartes in the
sweep of his inquiring glance some
were still and indifferent and several
were good-natured but all expecting
gun play had backed away from the
line of fire ignoring them montagne
turned again to tarte

  now jarvie drawled chester who
still held his gun on tarte gather the
coin an well be pullin our stakes
freight an all

  all ill take is my five hundred and
what tarte owes lambert said mon-
tagne stuffing his own bills and the
other five hundred dollars in gold into
his pockets i dont want any of that
skunks money

  youre too conscientious son said
chester but now well be goin you
keep them paws in the air till were out
o sight abe he commanded softly
and the two backed to the door whisked
out and slammed it behind them

  you good for a night ride par vie 
asked chester as they ran down the
dark street heading for the livery stable

  you bet im good for any action that
takes me out of this hole chuckled jar-
vis running easily beside him they
did not wait to rouse the stableman but
vance ripped montagnes saddle off the
peg flung it on a familiar pinto that
jarvis had ridden jerked the tie rope

off his own saddled broncho and the
two whirled out of the corral yard and
down the dusty grade toward the flat

desert which lay between them and cin-
nabar prospect

  the steep ore grade wound down the
mountain for miles before it dropped
gently through the foothills to the flat
sandy plain far below where the
mountains changed to sandy foothills
vance drew rein in the black shadow of
a canon buttress

  you wait fer me here janie just
below us a cut-off trail from morse
city joins this road an i aim to find
out without announcin my cornin by
a brass band whether any o abes
friends is plannin to ambush us an git
back that five hundred abe tarte
dont usually give up gold without some
patent-extraction process like we in-
vented back there wait till you hear
me if its an hour ill make a sound
like a kyote if its all right an you
come along an ill be waitin fer you
on the grade if you hear guns or
anything like that come a-runnin

  left alone in the darkness montagne
felt distinctly nervous the minutes
dragged interminably he waited so
long that the conviction was forcing it-
self upon him that he had been made
a fool of by that reckless mischievous
devil chester when he heard rhe drum-
ming of hoofs receding over the hills
to his right then he heard the high
shrill yapping laugh of a coyote and he
rode on with a sigh of relief suddenly
he started in the saddle when a low
chuckle sounded from the black shad-
ows through which he was riding

  hear them horses jarvie it was
easy i injuned round an come up past
where i found two bronchos waiting
back up the trail i couldnt help
makin a teeny bit o noise over the
rocks but they allowed it was their
horses so i got up close without them
smellin anything an there they was
-two of em peekin over the rocks at
a running account



the side o the trail halfway down the
canon slope they was waitin fer us
their backs was to me so i held em
both uf an added two to my arsenal
them hoofs you heard was them beatin
it back to morse without their six-guns
abe must a changed his mind about
payin ruels bill

  when they had plunged down through
the foothills and were out on the flat
they slowed to a steady jog riding in
inky blackness where the moon just
rising over the mountains looming
steeply on their right cast long black
shadows over the level desert floor

  then jarvis montagne chuckled
this whole business is most unethical
reckon there aint many ethics in
a crooked poker game stated the other
dryly but its always right to take
money from a crook-specially if it
belongs to you-also any guns that
might drill you even if they aint
yourn

  they rode in the darkness and silence
while montagne reviewed the evening
then he broke the silence lucky you
happened to be on hand to spot that
crooked play and back me up he said

  well i reckon theres foresight in
most luck drawled vance you see
old ruel reckoned a real good boy like
you might get some sort o peaceable
action on that old bill where t wouldnt
-me bein cinnabars horrible example
a wantin to collect it with a gun but
ruel figured it might be a good notion
for me to be handy to back up your
play so i been waitin fer you to show
up since noon

  much obliged vance for the help
but my reputations gone

  a chuckle came from the darkness
then chesters drawling words  dont
let that worry you none jarvie-mines
gone too-an it was a heap sight
worsen yours

  you boys meet tartes skinner
asked ruel lambert next morning

when they rode up to the cinnabar em-
porium

  no we took a short cut

  lambert was in a complacent humor

heard you brought home the bacon
yeh we did answered vance but
howd you know it 

  why abe tarte phoned over from
morse an told me hed paid jarvis an
you in full pologized fer keepin me
waitin an give me a whackin order
fer soft drinks an fancy provisions
said the cascade club was goin ter
be entertained in morse to-morrow an
he had to have extry grub immediate
he was awful excited an hurried told
me to deliver to his skinner who was
here with his mule oufit an to tell the
skinner to hustle to morse with em

  say old-timer asked chester
what might be the value o that picnic
grub an harmless refreshment

  i aint figured it up yet but with the
cigars for the state officials an all
tartes bill will run close to six hun-
dred dollars

an you figure to git that money
why not tartes just squared up
hasnt he bristled the old man and
he promised to remit as soon as the
cascade club has left

  vance chester grinned at the store-
keeper say ruel after showin up
tarte in a crooked poker game we had
to collect that five hundred at the point
of a gun then he blew smoke rings
thoughtfully gazed dreamily out into
the brilliant sunlight and spoke to the
world at large my old dad speakin
for himself lister allow that there
warnt no fool like an old fool so
you an me jarvie has got to invent a
bran-new scheme fer pryin six hundred
bucks out o that crook  for there aint
goin to be  cascade club in morse
city an hes got old ruel cinched
montagne turned to lambert i fig-
ured on resigning when i got back here
but now i think ill hang on till ches-
ter and i collect that bill

synopsis of preceding chapters

vvtiien john parks attempts to cross a perilous mountain trail in a blizzard he dies a victim of
vv the storm his little fcwiive-year-old boy tommy is left alone with billy a burro on the
night following his fathers death tommy comes upon a cave close by he makes camp during
the night a mountain lion kills the burro the next day tommy explores the cave and finds it
suitable to his needs as a place of abode he carries his fathers pack into the cave it consists
of tools a little food and clothing a tarpaulin a rifle a revolver ammunition and a few sundries
with these tommy begins the battle to live

    he frees a bear imprisoned in a cave and with her and her cubs he spends a fairly com-
fortable happy summer they hunt and forage for food together but when the bears bibemat
h- la ncain thrown on bi own resources shortly after the first winters snowfall tommy is captur-
ing a partridge when he loses all his matches he faces a hard winter severely handicapped

          to do nothing but lie still all the day
          in the heap of warmth-giving stuff
          which he had piled up

   but even in his drowsy rimes there
was an anguish of hunger a craving for
food which he could not have he
found himself wasting with a terrible
rapidity his body grew emaciated
his cheeks sunk his hands when he
raised them were wasted to such a point
that he hardly recognized them yet
every day in spite of that diminishing
strength he forced himself to get up
and go into the great outdoors to see
if he could sight some animal some
beast of prey which he might kill with
a rifle bullet to clothe himself in the
pelt

   once he sighted a great timber wolf
but his shaking hands could not hold
the weapon firm and the bullet flew
wide while the wolf trotted out of sight
with the slowness of contempt for this
puny hunter he failed thus on the

heaven-sent heat

            he miserable days dragged
on and he still lived he
managed by heaping all
the blankets and the tar-
paulin upon him to keep
warm enough in the cave
so long as he was lying down but when
he moved around the cold ate into him
venomously if he had had the proper
food he could have endured well
enough but raw meat was more than
his stomach could stand unless he were
exercising vigorously and in that bleak
weather he dared not expose himself for
long at a stretch gradually his
strength diminished a great drowsi-
ness began to grow in him it spread
through his body first-an aching fever
a false warmth broken with fierce spells
of shivering and utter cold and then
it reached his brain so that he wanted
wild freedom



only occasion when he sighted a pelt
worth having and now the time came
when he went out more and more sel-
dom and finally for three successive
days he did not leave the cave

  it was only a sudden reflex of will
that drove him out at length he wak-
ened one afternoon from a stupor he
hardly felt hunger now a haze hung
before his eyes the same haze hung
over his very mind but there was a
sudden parting of the veil as he saw
his hand raised before him a mere
withered claw rather than a hand

  the horror brought him erect there
he stood shuddering in the cold and
realizing that when he lay down again
it would be to fall into a sleep from
which there was no waking and fear
drove him on more strongly than dread
of the cold could keep him back pres-
ently swathed in blankets he staggered
weakly out of the cave a side draft
of the wind caught him and knocked
him flat he rose again and went on
blindly through the forest the rifle
dragging down in his hands as though
it were of a tons weight he knew
that even if he saw a fur worth having
he could not shoot the wearer and yet
on he went driven simply by a horror
of the cave and the death to which he
would be returning if he went back to
it

  he found himself stumbling across a
raw bare patch of earth from which a
recent landslide had torn the trees and
shrubs and tripping on a loose stone
he fell headlong for the tenth time he
was stunned by the fall when lie
roused again he found that he was half
frozen so frozen that when he leaned
and picked up the gun the weapon fell
from his numbed fingers and striking a
rock knocked out a bright spark

  tommy stared with vague agony
down at the stone in the very rock
there seemed to be fire he alone in all
creation was without warmth he was
still half dazed half stupid but that

spark had fascinated him regardless
of the harm that might be done the
barrel he dropped the rifle again and
again the spark jumped from the piece
of flat black stone

  suddenly he picked it up with a wild
hope growing in him sparks will light
fire this must be a flint what had
the indians used for centuries before
him with the stone hugged to his
breast with the rifle trailing behind him
he made on toward the cave as fast as
his weak knees would support his
strides

  so muddy from his falls with a
ringing as of bells in his ears he en-
tered the cave and looked about him
for tinder he found something ex-
cellent for his purpose-a pile of dried
bark which he had used to start his
fires while the matches lasted some
of this he shredded to a bundle of small
fibers so brittle that they threatened to
crumble to a powder he gathered
larger wood near by and then he took
the revolver as a handier bit of steel
and the flint dropped at an angle he
began to knock a shower of sparks upon
the tinder

  they fell all over the bark a faint
smoke arose but when he ceased strik-
ing the flint the smoke died out he
worked until his weak arms ached
then as despair was coming over him
there was a new thought he ham-
mered again with all his might and
main tossed aside the battered gun as
soon as he saw a small spot glowing on
the bark and began to fan this with his
breath

  he blew till his lungs threatened to
burst till his head grew dizzy and be-
hold the smoldering spot of dark grew
in width ate into the bark hastily he
placed more shreds of the crumpled
bark upon the spot again he blew
and now a thin column of smoke rose
to tommy it was the most blissful sight
he had ever seen literally it meant
life
to

western story magazine

  again he blew with all his might
the smoldering increased grew audible
there was a faint sparkling the smoke
cloud increased tenfold he began to
fan the heap with a part of the blanket
and now the smoldering place became
a vivid orange which lighted up his
hands at work suddenly a little
tongue of flame shot up quivered while
tommy hung breathless over it and
then steadied into a swiftly growing
blaze he had made fire he had
made it of steel and stone and wood
and a great wave of gratitude flooded
through tommy he cast up his arms
tears streamed down his face

  but he dared not wait quickly he
threw on the bits of wood the smoke
rose again as the fire worked then a
new and stronger flame burst out and
like a madman he threw on more and
more wood a roaring blaze shook up
toward the top of the cave a soaring
flame licked against the roof itself
and tommy sat down with his blanket
thrown away unneeded his arms put
out to the heaven-sent heat

  a month later on a day there blew
up a warm wind it was a true chinook
it melted the snows in the lower valleys
as though a fire had been built upon
them in a fortnight tommy had dry
footing for his hunting trips

  he came out from the winter prison
hollow cheeked still weak in body from
the great ordeal but full of pride full
of invincible confidence in his strength
to face any ordeals before him

chapter xiii

the stratfger comes

j-je made his first trip to the cave of
madame grizzly the entrance
was still blocked with brush he ex-
erted no effort to rouse them he was
wise enough to understand that there is
no safety in interfering with mother
nature when she is at her work

  so he went back down the slopes
finding every trail crossed with rivulets
fed from snows that were melting un-
der the trees it was on this trip that
he made his first kill of big game
something stirred in a thicket before
him he jerked out the revolver and
stood eagerly waiting and in a moment
a little brown-bodied deer stepped into
view and tommy fired

  he almost regretted what he had
done as he stood over the beautiful lit-
tle body a moment later but life in the
wilderness is a grim thing it is kill or
be killed and tommy had lived there
long enough to understand it

  many times he had seen his father
cut up deer and now he set busily to
work getting off the hide there was
many a slip of the knife many a slit in
the tender pelt but eventually after a
weary task of tugging and pulling and
cutting the work was done after a
fashion then he cut the deer into
quarters hung three parts as high as
he could on a shrub and carried one
ham back to the cave

  to roast a quarter in the dutch oven
was a considerable task moreover it
was one which he had never performed
before except under the strict supervi-
sion of his father and it was dark in
the cave before he peered at his cook-
ery and decided that it was done and
what a fragrance greeted his nostrils
as he opened the oven surely that
was worth waiting for

  he had just sat back to enjoy the
meal in prospect when a hitman voice
the first he had heard in almost a year
spoke from the entrance

  hello son

  he leaped to his feet with a shout
of astonishment and he saw that a
big rough - bearded man had just
crawled through the entrance to the
cave and had risen to his height-a
huge thick-shouldered man in the later
middle of life

  there was one pang of disappoint-
wild freedom



ment of unbearable sorrcnv in tommy
as he saw that it was not john parks
come back to him in that instant hope
of the return died forever in his breast
and in another breathing space he was
wild with joy because a human being
had at last crossed his trail the long
silence was ended he went to the big
man with a rush

  oh cried tommy how did you
come-how did you come plow did
you find me

  here the big fellow stepped back
from him gathered his bushy brows
and peered down at tommy with little
black bright eyes

  look here son he said you aint
telling me that youre living here alone
are you  your pa aint here with you
he said this with an eagerness which
tommy could not understand and the
boy told all his story in ten words but
the instant he had learned that john
parks was dead the stranger seemed
to lose all interest in the rest of the
narrative and the story of tommys
sufferings he strode forward lifted
the cover and inhaled the fragrance of
the roasted venison

  well eat now he said and well
talk things over later on

  and so saying his big knife in-
stantly slashed into the vitals of the
roast he began to eat wolfishly and
tommy amazed and bewildered by such
treatment stood for a time in the offing
when he approached to take something
for himself the stranger lifted his eyes
with a silent glare and tommy re-
treated again not until the big man
had ended his meal bolting the meat
in great chunks could tommy take a
portion in what he considered safetv

  by this time he was thoroughly
frightened but the black-bearded fellow
had reclined against a stone and spread
out his legs toward the fire he began
to roll a cigarette

  make yourself handy son he
grunted after a time when the cigarette

was lighted and he had blown a cloud
of smoke upwards get some wood
on that fire

  tommy moved as though he had been
struck with a whip half choking on the
mouthful he was eating and after he
had obediently heaped on the wood and
the flame wras soaring the fear of the
taciturn stranger had increased in him
to such an extent that his throat closed
and he could not speak he sat watch-
ing and waiting uneasily and still the
stranger did not stir but seemed to
drink up the heat of the fire while his
eyes bored into tommy

  the boy began to notice the equip-
ment of the big man now he was
wearing rough clothes which were plas-
tered with mud and torn with a thou-
sand small rents such as come when
one rushes recklessly through dense for-
est or climbs over rough rocks with
many a slip and fall also in spite of
the bushy beard of the man and his
stalwart frame tommy saw that the
upper part of his cheeks were sunken
and his eyes buried plainly he had
made a long and hurried march he
had made it on foot and he had made
it without so much as a blanket yet
he had chosen to carry a perfect arsenal
of guns and ammunition he was
weighed down with a colt and a heavy
cartridge belt crammed full of bullets
and now there rested beside him a re-
peating rifle of the newest and most
expensive model tommy could see
that it had been scrupulously cared for
there was not so much as a scratch
lpon the wood of the butt

  from these things he began to make
deductions actively men did not
travel over the mountains hastily in the
time of the thaw equipped with only
guns and bullets unless they were either
pursuing or fleeing and something
told tommy that this was not a case
of pursuit men who pursue are fear-
less and the keen eyes of this fellow
rested upon even a boy like tommy


western story magazine

with a world of suspicion and cautious
reserve

  look here kid he said suddenly
how long you been here

  almost a year said tommy

  a year said the other and no-
body aint been near you all that time

  nobody said tommy

  not a soul eh

  not a soul

  the big man drew a great breath
and then in silence he stared off into
vacancy presently he began to smile
evidently what he had learned had
pleased him immensely

  and said tommy id like to
know when we start on

  what said the stranger when
we start on

  i-i thought said tommy that
youd take me with you when you
went

  the other laughed with a brutal ab-
ruptness

  now why said he are you aching
to get back to other folks whatll
they do for you nothing look at
the way i been treated by everybody
look at the way everybody has treated
me

 he stopped suddenly and eyed
tommy in that keen way he had until
he apparently decided that there was
nothing to fear he shrugged his
shoulders his tongue loosened

  there aint no justice down among
men he said in a voice half gruff and
half whining they dont give a man
a chance look at me is a gent re-
sponsible for what he does when hes
got some hooch under his belt no he
aint no right-thinking man can say
that he is but i wake up with a head-
ache not knowing what ive done and
find about a dozen of em chasing me
with dogs and guns no questions
aked they just open fire when -hey
sight me well says i to myself
whats all the fuss about what have
i done but there aint any use waiting

to get my questions answered with a
slug through the head so  fool it for
the hills and give em the clean slip and
have a dang liard trip-and finally
i wind up here and heres where im
going to stay and heres where youre
going to stay he added fiercely i
aint going to have nobody sneaking out
and telling where  am if youve been
here a year without nobody finding you
i guess i can stay here a year the same
way and bv that time things will have
cleared up a little and i can go down
and look around and see how the land
lies aint that sense

  he seemed to be speaking to himself
more than to tommy and the boy kept
a discreet silence suddenly the head
of the fugitive jerked around and the
keen little brute eyes glared at tommy
come here he roared

  tommy came trembling the big
hand of the stranger shot out and
clamped around tommys wrist the
pressure seemed to be cracking the
bones

  youre going to stay right on here
with me kid he thundered be-
sides if you can forage for one you can
forage for two so you start in and
make me comfortable and there aint
going to be no getting away if you
try to run for it ill start out and trail
you and im the out-trailingest man
you ever seen id run you down in-
side a couple of hours and then id
tear you to bits

  his eyes snapped and his teeth
gleamed behind his beard as he spoke
and tommys heart turned cold

  speak out roared the big man
tel me how you like me

  fine stammered poor tommy i
-i like you fine

  you lie cried the big man and
with a sweep of his diick arm he
knocked tommy flat on his back

  the sting of the blow on his cheek
worked like a strange madness in
tommy he had been accustomed to
wild freedom

 

the gentle ways of john parks he
could not understand a rough voice and
a heavy hand and unreasoning he
came off the ground like the recoil of
a cat and flew at the face of the
stranger

 the latter had barely time to
erect a guard and that guard was
insufficient he lurched to his feet
while the stinging small fists were cut-
ting into his face with a rain of blows
once erect he pushed tommy away
with a long extended arm the won-
der left his face a cruel interest took
its place and he poised his great right
hand

  im going to lesson you he said
savagely drawing his breath in with
joy at the prospect im going to give
you one lesson for the sake of manners
and showing you whos the boss stand
off you imp

  the last word was a grunt of rage
as tommy slipped under the extended
arm and struck savagely into the body
of the big man and then the blow
fell it came straight and hard with
the overmastering weight of the stran-
gers shoulder behind it it struck
tommy on the side of the head and
rolled him along the ground

  he lay there stunned with a sting
along the side of his face and a warmth
which told him that the skin had been
broken by that brutal stroke

  get up roared the big man and
he kicked tommy with his heavy boot

  that wild anger leaped into the heart
of the boy again he came off the
ground how he could not say and
sprang into the face of the stranger

  you little wild cat gasped out the
big man and recoiled though driven
more by astonishment than by his hurts

  that instant of recoil however gave
another opportunity to tommy he
leaped to the pile of dried wood which
he had heaped along one side of the
cave and a second later the billet
cracked heavily along the sconce of the

stranger again tommy struck and
again he shouted with a wild satisfac-
tion as he felt the wood bite soft and
heavy into flesh then the stick was
torn from his hand he leaped away
and he raced for the entrance to the
cave knowing that now nothing could
save him but flight the big man was
not cursing and his silence meant
strangely more than oaths

  he was almost at the entrance when
something told him to dodge down
he dropped in a heap and barely in
time the scooping arms of the big
man swept over him brushing his
clothes the toes of the strangers boot
lodged with sickening force against his
ribs then the other crashed against
the rocks with a shout of pain and rage
but tommy rising hastily to his feet
again knew that his finish had come for
now the big man was between him and
the mouth of the cave

the work of man

i-ie slipped back into the very center
of the cave where he would have
more room yet he knew that even
there he was playing a losing game in
speed of foot in endurance he could not
compare with the grown man pres-
ently he would be cornered and the
great bone-breaking hands would fall
upon him after that-

  his horrified mind grew blank but
having picked up another stick of wood
he waited he might strike and dodge
at the same time and so gain another
chance to get at the outlet but that
chance was only one in ten and he
glanced longingly up the side of the
cave where he had laid away rifle and
revolver on a higher shelf oh fool
that he had been to put his weapons in
a place where they were not instantly
accessible

  the stranger seemed to have the
same thought he had risen slowly

from the ground drawing out his re-
volver as he did so but a second of
thought seemed to reassure him he
pushed the colt back into its holster
and he began to advance slowly with
such a face of fiendish rage that tommy
was paralyzed no there would be no
dodging now this cold fury would
prove inescapable he saw a tiny
trickle of crimson down the face of the
man and into the beard that red mark
would be warrant for his own destruc-
tion beyond a doubt

  now gasped out the other now-
well try something

  and he came with his great arms
spread out moving with long stealthy
strides as though he were stealing up
on an unwatchful victim and in that
nightmare horror tommy could not
move

  it was then he saw a dark form
emerging out of the spot of black night
at the mouth of the cave with jack
and jerry crowding behind her in wad-
dled madame bruin with as much as-
surance as though into her own cave
and a shout of joyous welcome a cry
of wildest relief burst from tommys
lips

  that shout made the big man whirl
on his heel one instant he stood petri-
fied with astonishment then madame
reared up and stood immense on her
hind legs with a roar at this unexpected
stranger another moment and she
would have taken to her heels but the
big man did not wait he plunged to
the side of the fire and snatched up his
rifle and pitched the butt into the hol-
low of his shoulder it happened all
in a twinkling the gun spoke and
madame pitched heavily forward and
died before she struck the ground

  there was a hoarse shout of exulta-
tion from the man the rifle steadied
again spoke again and jack with a
squeal of agonv whirled around dou-
bled up on the ground with the pain
and then stretched out limp and there

stood jerry bewildered sitting back on
his haunches in the most utter amaze-
ment and looking to tommy as though
for explanation of this strange catas-
trophe

  tommys fear for himself was for-
gotten he saw the gun steady but
he sprang at the big man and the shock
of his body made the other shoot wild

  curse you cried the murderer and
with a short-arm blow he struck tommy
to the ground your turn comes
last r

  run jerry shouted tommy a he
lay in the dirt

  but jerry did not run his brain
was not what it would be a day hence
it was thick and sleepy from the long
hibernation and calamities had rained
down so fast upon those around him
that his keen mind was stunned he
sat up there still with his head cocked
to one side and innocently faced the
rifle

  so much tommy saw with a side
glance and he saw too that the big
man was steadying the rifle for another
shot steadying it carefully thereaf-
ter he would tell how he slew three
grizzlies with three shots in as many
seconds

  but fear for jerry raised tommy
he stood up with a shrill cry only
with a gun could this destroyer be
stopped and he reached for the butt
of the revolver at the big mans thigh
just as the other with an oath struck
him down again he fell but his fin-
gers had gripped the weapon and drawn
it forth there he lay with blfick night
swirling around his brain

  tlfbrain you thundered the big
man and reached for the weapon which
tommy had stolen

  and tommy pulled the trigger he
fired blindly all before him was thick
night and in answer to the bullet a
crushing weight fell upon him and he
felt that he had failed after that the
darkness was complete
wild freedom

  when he wakened jerry was licking
his face

  he sat up with his brain still reeling
there lay the big-bearded man on his
face beside him motionless and in
the entrance to the cave lay madame and
jack in the same postures of their fall

  that sight was enough to bring
tommy to himself he stood up and
ran to make sure it was not the hu-
man being for whom he felt concern
it was not dread for having taken a
human life that stung tommy it was
overwhelming remorse that the affec-
tion which had brought madame bruin
to him had brought her to her death

  but she was quite dead and jack was
dead beside her he took the great un-
wieldy head in his lap jerry sniffed
the cold nose and then looked up with
a whine into the face of his young mas-
ter for explanation but tommy could
only answer with tears

  then in the midst of his grief he
shook his fist toward the inert form of
the killer here was man at last man
for whose coming he had yearned so
bitterly this was the work of man

chapter xv

after years have passed

the first minute of waiting is always
the longest that first year in the
valley of the turnbull was always the
longest to tommy it seemed to him
that it embraced more than half of his
life for fear and loneliness and weak-
ness and peril had lengthened every day
to an infinity but the time that fol-
lowed flew on wings every minute
was crowded there is no dull moment
to the man who tears his living by force
of hand and force of cunning out of the
wilderness and when events happen
most swiftly time seems to fly on the
strongest wing to tom parks it
seemed that there was only one stride
through the next few years so let us
step across them in the same manner

 d-w

with one step and come to tom in the
spring of his sixteenth year

  a babble of sharp noises wakened
him the daybreak chorus of the forest
and tom rose from his bed on a bear-
skin thrown across soft pine branches
he stood up now grown to his full
height of a shade more than six feet
equipped with nearly a hundred and
seventy pounds of iron-hard muscle
he looked four years more than his
sixteen except that the down of man-
hood was only beginning to darken o
his upper lip and on his chin but that
crease of pain and thoughtfulness which
had been cleft in the center of his fore-
head had never departed and there was
a resolution an independence of a
grown man in his face

  he stretched his arms long and pow-
erful until the last of the sleep fled tin-
gling out at his finger tips he yawned
and exposed a set of white perfect
teeth then with a shake of his head
he tore off the shirt in which he had
lain down to sleep it was made of the
softest buckskin sewed with sinew-a
roughly made garment with mere holes
for the head and the arms his trou-
sers were of the same stuff ending in
a ragged fringe between knee and ankle
he dropped them from him and stood
naked in the chill of the morning air-
brown as though carved cunningly out
of bronze

  through the cave he sped into the
rosy flush of morning sunlight then
a flashing form he was down the slope
to where the creek swirled into a deep
long pool he leaped onto a rock and
stood a moment before plunging in
around him he heard life waking in the
woods he heard birds calling he
heard swift rustlings which were not of
the wind among the foliage far above
him a hawk flew he marked its flight
with interest no it was not a hawk
it was a great eagle a hawk at that
height would seem far smaller yes
it was an eagle no doubt that old eagle

of bald mountain tom parks turned
his head to watch until the speeding
king of the air was shut from view past
the treetops then he lowered his head
and dived

  the water closed behind his feet
without noise with hardly a ripple
and silently he came to the surface
again turned on his face and swam
with long strong silent strokes straight
ahead it seemed that he would surely
strike the great trunk which shot out
from the bank with its tangle of
drowned branches but when he was
a foot away up flashed his legs down
went his head he was under the
trunk then came all noiseless as ever
to the surface trod water until he was
exposed to the breast and stood there
laughing silently

  but that water was snow fed ice
cold and even the leather skin and the
tough muscles of toms body could not
keep ouc the chill from vital places
back he turned for the shore the long
arms slipped through the water and
v-ithout a splash he came to shore

  the sun turned him to a figure of
gleaming running quicksilver but
that wind blowing on his wet skin was
too cold he slicked the water from
his body with his hands then he
picked a section of clean grass lay
down and rolled in it he came up
drier-and dirtier he brushed off the
leaves and what dirt would come for
the rest-what did he care dirt meant
nothing in the life of tom parks he
wrung the water out of his long sun-
faded brown hair and then raced up the
slope to ttie cave

  still he was not dry enough to dress
many a day of stilt muscles and an
aching body had taught him that it is
better to have a dry skin before clothes
are put on it so he stepped to the side
of the cave where a huge grizzly lay
asleep into the side of the monster he
thrust his toes and jabbed the ribs un-
der their layer of thick pelt and fat

  jerry awoke with a grunt blinked
and then straightway stood up he
had grown into a monster even of his
monstrous kind there was well over
a thousand pounds of meat and bone
and hide in this giant there would be
even more when the autumn nuts had
fattened him

  he put out his arms like a man
stretching but the instant he did so
tom parks was at him the hard
shoulder of the youngster struck the
breast of the bear the long brown
arms wrapped around the furry body
with all his might he strove to topple
jerry topple half a tons weight of
heaven-taught wrestler 

  jerry merely grunted with one
bone-crushing hug he squeezed the
breath out of toms body then came
a flick of the forepaw and tom parks
wtas sent staggering to a distance he
gasped but he came in again with a
rush his flying fists struck home on
the solid body-one-two-but again
came that inescapable stroke of the paw
it was nicely judged- -oh how deli-
cately managed a little more and he
could have caved r toms chest with
the stroke but jerry vas an old hand
at this game and he struck just hard
enough to knock tom flat on his back

  he was up again like a cat but that
had been enough boxing for one morn-
ing he was in a glow of heat and
the blood was coursing strongly through
his arteries he brushed off the sand
stepped into his buckskin suit and
slipped moccasins onto his feet he
was ready for the day

  jerry went out to hunt for grubs on
the hillside while tom kindled a fire
over that tire he fried flat thin cakes
of corn meal mixed with water no
meat till night for tom he had
formed that habit long ago blit when
evening came he would eat enough for
three

  that quick breakfast done he went
out down the hillside and with a shrill
wild freedom



whistle brought jerry after him down
they went across the plateau where that
years crop of corn was burgeoning out
above the ground

  jerry roved in the rear he was an
incurable loiterer there were thou-
sands of food scents blowing to his nos-
trils every instant he had to stop a
few minutes here and a few minutes
there to demolish a colony of ants or to
turn a log and get at grubs or to tear
a rotten stump to pieces because of the
horde of insect life it harbored be-
sides he could overtake the master at
will for on one of these roving expe-
ditions after amusement tom loitered
through the forest seeing and hearing
and learning out of an inexhaustible
book

  when there was an expedition to a
distant point on hand that was quite
another matter then one sharp shrill
wdiistle apprized jerry that there was
business on hand and he forgot his ap-
petite until the point was reached but
what he much preferred was one of
these leisurely scouting trips they
might be back by night they might
not return for a week for he had noted
that tom took with him the fishing line
as well as his hunting knife as for a
gun his store of ammunition had been
used up long before  but the line and
hook were enough and if he wanted
additional food he knew a dozen sorts
of bird traps which he could make and
bait with good results as for lire he
carried a piece of flint and the barrel
of the demolished old colt revolver he
could raise a flame when he willed

  jerry did not sight tom again until
noon and then he came up to the youth
lying prone on a bank of grass and peer-
ing around a tree trunk to watch bea-
vers busily at work cutting down trees
it was a new dam near the mouth of
one of the turnbulls tributaries the
water had been backed into a little
gorge and the beavers were just be-
ginning to levy their toll on the forest

a dozen sapling were down and
trimmed of branches and jerry
stretched contentedly beside tom to
watch the work to be sure beaver
meat was good very good and there
was always an unfilled corner in that
capacious belly of him but now the
little fellows were laboring so close to
the edge of their pond that it would be
impossible to surprise them and next
to eating jerry loved to satisfy his
curiosity

  it was a whole long hour before tom
had gazed his fill then he stood up
and clapped his hands and he laughed
silently and heartily as the beavers dived
for shelter beneath the water he had
learned his noiseless swimming from
them but he could never match their
craft in water ways but here was
something worth knowing-this new
dam it was another treasure added
to his horde in the winter he would
come down here and get enough fur to
clothe him like a prince through the sea-
son of the snows

  all the rest of that day tom headed
leisurely westward down the valley of
the turnbull jerry followed though
in high discontent for by the evening
they had passed the limits of the terri-
tory over which jerrys mother had
roamed and which jerry and tom had
taken as their natural domain since the
death of the wise old grizzly but as
evening came a windfall came to jerry
in the shape of a fat buck

  there had been born in jerry the
skill of all grizzlies in slipping silently
through a forest in spite of their bulk
and so it was gliding through the twi-
light that he came suddenly on the
rank scent of meat and an instant later
-for they had turned directly into the
wind-the deer sprang up before him
in a thicket confusion made the poor
creature run into the jaws of destruc-
tion a crushing blow smashed its
skull and both jerry and tom dined in
state that evening


western story magazine

  with the morning when jerry was
preparing to turn back hugely uneasy
at this venturing into unknown coun-
try tom persisted in holding straight
on down the valley what moved him
to it he did not know but in this wan-
dering down the course of the turn-
bull there had awakened in him a sud-
den and fierce disgust with the cave
and everything in it and all the delight-
ful country which he called his own
there was no temptation to go back
over the bleak mountains which he had
climbed with his father but a hunger
of curiosity grew up in him to see what
undiscovered country lay westward

  already he had come farther west
than ever before and still the pangs
of curiosity increased and he went on
in spite of the careless mode of travel
they had covered a full thirty miles on
the first day on the second the dis-
tance was a great deal more for tom
pushed on relentlessly from dawn to
midday then he rested and both he
and jerry slept but in the evening
they pushed on once more

  so it was that they came to the first
settlers cabin it was almost dark but
far away tom heard a faint ringing
sound which he presently recognized as
the blows of an ax clipped home with
great force into hard wood the sound
ceased before he came close but it was
easy to continue to the place with
jerry leading the way with an acute
nose

  and so they reached the verge of a
man-made clearing there was an acre
of naturally cleared land and there
were ten acres more which had been
cleared by cutting down the trees in
the exact center was a small log cabin
whose open door was flooded with light
and shadow flung in waves from an
open fireplace and a guitar was tin-
kling and thrumming from the in-
terior

  the heart of tom leaped within him
the wind blowing through the trees

above him was suddenly as mournful
as a human sigh and big jerry as
though smitten with a sudden dread
turned about and looked tom -squarely
in the face to read his thoughts per-
haps it was only because the sensitive
nose of jerry was telling him tales of
bacon and ham and a score of other
delectables and he was silently wonder-
ing why the master did not proceed to
investigate

  but now the music ceased and a
great rough bass voice spoke it made
the very hair on toms head bristle as
he recalled that unforgetable voice of
the man who had killed jerrys mother
a man with such a voice could not but
be an enemy made terrible by the pos-
session of firearms

  in the gathering night he turned
from the house and made a gesture to
the grizzly that sent the latter into re-
treat but it was not to be an alto-
gether peaceful journey a shifting of
the wind had blown their scent to the
house and suddenly behind them came
the yelling of dogs sweeping closer
then breaking with a confusion of
echoes through the forest as they en-
tered the trees and jerry stood up
with a profound growl to listen while
tom realizing that they could not flee
from these fleet-footed assailants
planted himself beside the bear with a
drawn knife

  instantly they came four huge wolf-
ish beasts scarred with many a battle
they recoiled at the sight of the man
but on the bear was the scent of this
man and the bear scent was equally on
the man their minds were instantly
made up and they flew to the attack
two leaped at jerry from in front but
they were wise fighters they made
only a pretense of attack the real
work must come from those in the rear
the other pair trained fighters that
they were jumped to take the bear at
disadvantage and here it was that they
encountered tom
wild freedom

c

  his heart was raging with excite-
ment but he had learned that first great
lesson of the wilderness where all crea-
tures light to kill that successful battle
can only be waged with a cool head
half crouched ready to leap to either
side he poised the long knife one
brute rushed for his legs and the other
drove at his throat he leaped high to
avoid the first and twisting to miss the
second he slashed it across the gullet
as it flew by him

  he himself landed heavily on his side
he twisted to his feet like lightning
the dog he had used the knife on was
standing to the side head down cough-
ing and bleeding to death but the first
brute wheeling as it missed its rusfo
was on him in a twinkling the eye
could barely follow the moves of tom
then he sprang like a cat to the side
caught the great brute by the scuff of
the neck and as the animal whirled to
sink its teeth in his arm he drove the
knife home between its ribs

  his arm was bloody above the wrist
as he turned back to jerry just in time
to see one of the dogs half wolf and
half mastiff venture too close a light-
ning blow of the foxepaw and a
crushed skull for the dog were the re-
sult the fourth dog leaped back
viewed the carnage for an instant and
then fled in dismay howling

  jerry made a lunge in pursuit but
tom called him back for voices of ex-
cited men were sounding not far away
and men meant guns and guns meant
that the only safety lay in flight a
low whistle apprized jerry that over-
whelming odds were now opposed to
them and tom took to his heels

chapter xvi

a mistreated day

j-je ran like the wind during the first
quarter of a mile weaving deftly
through the trees for he had been
trained to such night work by many a

prowl in company with jerry he could
read the ground underfoot almost as
though he saw in the dark after that
first sprint as the voices died away be-
hind him he still ran on like a wild
thing which cannot measure danger but
only knows that it is somewhere in the
rear an indescribable tiling his swift
and easy stride did not slacken until
ten miles were behind him

  then breathing hard but by no
means winded he went ahead at a brisk
walk with jerry lumbering and grunt-
ing behind him they encountered a
steep hill he slipped onto jerrys
back and they went up it handily
down the farther slope they ran again
and so they hurried on through the
night

  just before dawn he paused at a
creek and spent an hour fishing with
great results for jerry and himself
then they pushed on until midmorning
reached the forested crest of a hill and
there made their covert

  they slept soundly until midafter-
noon and wakened as they had fallen
asleep-in an instant they climbed
on then to a higher range of hills to
the westward and here from the naked
summit tom found that he was looking
out on more than he had dreamed of

  far to the east the bald mountains
were lost in the pale horizon haze all
that he could see was the procession of
rolling forested hills which climbed up
the valley of the turnbull north be-
hind him rose higher hills climbing to
nakedl mountain heights south
stretched the wide expanse of the val-
ley with the broad turnbull flashing in
the midst and sweeping away to the
west in lazy curves quite different from
the arrowy little stream which he knew
near the cave and through his own ter-
ritory

  westward also lay the things which
most amazed him in this direction the
air was free of mist the hills sloped
away to smoother forms and he saw the


western story magazine

landscape dotted with houses and
checked in loose patterns with fences
and yonder not quite lost to his view
the houses collected in a village a thick
cluster of roofs and trees

  and for years all of this had lain
hardly more than a hundred miles from
his own cave he would have wel-
comed that sight four years before
this prospect would have been better
than a promise of heaven to the lonely
boy but that was before the big
stranger came to the cave and engraved
in his mind the lesson that men are
dangerous treacherous cruel ungrate-
ful and so it was that tom as he
stared down on these houses shivered
a little and then cast a glance back over
his shoulder as men do when they are in
fear

  all his past before the death of his
mother and the day his father left the
city and started into the mountains was
lost behind a veil of indistinctness but
he remembered enough to know that his
father and mother had both suffered at
the hands of other men that there had
been poverty in their household that
there had been hunger even so there
was ingrained in his mind the belief
that men are evil the first man he had
met since the death of his father had
repaid food and shelter with brutality
the second voice he had heard had been
of one who kept fierce dogs that had
attacked him without warning without
justification in his buckskin trousers
there were still spots of blood ay that
was the cardinal sign of man-blood-
shed 

  he shuddered in a strong revulsion

  yet that afternoon in spite of jer-
rys earnest endeavors to stop the west-
ward journey and head back toward the
home country he insisted upon skirt-
ing along the hills to get a better view
of all that the valley might hold and
before the day was ended he saw an-
other proof that man is brute and noth-
ing but brute

  they passed among the trees to the
head of a promontory a low plateau
which thrust out into the more level or
rolling ground and from the brow of
this eminence tom found hirnsdf in
view of men-many men a ranch
house with shambling barns and out-
houses around it had been built just be-
neath the cliff and now between the
rearmost of the houses and the base
of the cliff a dozen men were gathered
with their horses in or around a large
corral several of the men were
grouped closely around one of their
number who lay upon the ground ap-
parently badly hurt they were pour-
ing water upon his face and chest but
he was not the main object of interest

  in the center of the corral four men
were holding a young bay stallion sad-
dled and blindfolded he danced rest-
lessly his head snubbed to the saddle of
another horse and instantly tom con-
nected that empty saddle on the bay
with the prostrate man outside the
fence

  presently the latter arose and stag-
gered to the fence where he leaned
feebly another rider now advanced
climbed into the saddle and the others
grouped as close as possible around the
fence to watch while the ropes were
taken from the stallion and his head
was freed of the blindfold

  there followed one minute of more
condensed action than tom had ever
seen even when jack and jerry were
having a mimic combat for the bay
began to leap into the air tie himself
almost literally into a knot and then
land on stiff legs the rider was jolted
and jarred from side to side  sud-
denly the bay reared and flung himself
backward the yell of the watchers
came tingling up to tom on the height
but his fierce heart was all with the
horse why had they united to torture
the poor creature

  the rider had flung himself from the
saddle barely in time but when he rose
wild freedom



he apparently refused to continue the
contest yet still the struggles of the
stallion were not over a third rider
presented himself distinguished by a
blue bandanna ajid a sombrero whose
belt gleamed avith pure burnished gold
he mounted as the other had done
once more the battle began and this
time it lasted thrice as long tom
could see that the young stallion had
grown black with sweat but he fought
on as though he were muscled with
springs and in the end a leap a jar-
ring landing and a spring to the side
unseated the rider

  he fell in a cloud of dust while the
tormented horse fled to the farther side
of the corral and tried to leap to safety
beyond the bars he was roped and
brought down heavily on his side and
while he lay there the dismounted man
of the blue bandanna approached and
quirted the helpless body brutally

  this however seemed too much for
even the other savages they drew the
fellow away the stallion was allowed
to climb to his feet and was led away
and the group dispersed

  but the heart of tom followed the
beautiful bay for on the morrow would
not the torture begin again and
would they not persist until they had
broken his spirit and his heart sav-
agely he shook his fist at the backs of
the disappearing men and jerry
comprehending the anger though not
its cause stopped in his digging for a
ground squirrel and looked up with a
growl among the trees

  but after that tom turned eastward
again and jerry went joyously in the
lead they had both had too much of
men a bright-running trout stream
a mile away however was too great a
temptation to them both there they
paused while tom caught their supper
he risked a fire carefully made of
dead wood so that there would be as
little smoke as possible and broiled a

small part of his catch for himself
while jerry devoured the remainder

  wken that meal was ended the twi-
light was descending and tom with a
filled stomach found that the vision of
the bay still haunted him it seemed
to fill his mind that picture of the
horse he began to remember an old
mustang which his father had used for
mountain work even that treacherous
brute he had loved for men are born
to love horses or to despise them and
tom was one of the former

   and it seemed to him that if he could
have that magnificent creature in the
mountains his happiness would be com-
plete not to ride to be sure for his
own legs were good enough to carry
him where he wished to go and when
he was tired there was the exhaustless
power of that matchless mountaineer
jerry to carry him on

  but how could he take a wild horse
from men who were armed with guns

  that question lay heavily on the mind
of tom as the twilight thickened he
sat brooding beside the fire until jerry
began to growl so great was his eager-
ness for the return journey to twice-
traveled fields but tom shook his
head that very insistence confirmed
him in his new desire

  the point is he said to the huge
bear that ive got to have that horse
and if i cant have him ive got to
have one more look at him stay here
jerry im going back

  it was a command which jerry un-
derstood he stood still with an al-
most human groan and tom turned
drew tight his belt and started back
at a run

  he never walked when he was bent
on business walking was the gait for
leisure and careful observation but he
had learned to read even a difficult trail
while he ran and now he jogged back
through the trees twisted aside into the
head of the canon to his right and then
let out a link and raced blitely across
western story magazine

the rolling ground until he turned the
point of the promontory and the ranch
houses were in view

  the instant he saw the first lighted
window he slowed to a walk he had
learned from jerrys mother a lesson
of caution which he never forgot and
jerry himself was an alert hunter he
could not cross a clearing no matter
how small without first pausing an in-
stant to take in his surroundings he
seemed to carry in the back of his brain
a clumber crowded with memories of
dangers which had come upon his an-
cestors he suspected every tree ap-
parently lest it might turn into a mon-
ster

  there was something of the same
manner in tom as he approached the
house he took advantage of every
tree he skulked swiftly down the hol-
lows he crawled on hands and knees
over the knolls 

  when he came to the ftrst barn his
caution redoubled round it he stole
and then he heard mens voices-many
of them a shudder crept down his
spine as he listened for the memory
of the stranger in his cave was still
rank and never having matched his
strength againsti another man how
could he know that even that giant of
a man would have been helpless now
against his own lightning speed of hand
and foot and that strange strength with
which his muscles had been seasoned
by those years of exposure and constant
exercise all he knew was that he had
been helpless in the hands of a man once
before and he felt that he would be
helpless again

  nevertheless he went on he came
in view of the house itself long low
thrown loosely together with only three
lighted windows in its length these
were open and from one of them came
the tumult of voices

  he stole to it and looked in what
he saw was a group of four men around
a table playing cards each man was

flanked with a glass and there were bot-
tles behind the chairs from which now
and again they poured a trickle of am-
ber liquid into their glasses drank and
played again the talk came at inter-
vals sometimes there was a solemn
silence while the cards were sent flash-
ing out around the table and the hands
were picked up then they began to
push out money toward the center of
the table some of the cards were dis-
carded others were drawn and more
money was stacked all in a deadly seri-
ousness but tom cast only an idle
glance of wonder at their occupation
he gave his more serious attention to
the faces of the players

chapter xvii

peter is taken

and if he traveled round and round
the country he could not have
found four more repulsive faces
greed ferocity cruelty were ingrained
in eadi it was no practiced eye with
which tom looked upon them but in-
stinct taught him all he needed to know
how different they were from john
parks the surety grew in him that
his father had been a different breed
of man a single exception but the
rest of the human race were evil all
evil he felt his detestation grow for
how could all of these be compared in
worth with that beautiful horse he had
seen them torturing that day

  here the man of the blue bandanna
pushed hack his chair his pile of
money was gone

  im busted boys he said but
wholl stake me twenty

  on what hank asked another
whats your security

  on old peter said hank

  twenty dollars on that hoss mur-
mured the other

well asked hank aggressively

   ill tell you said the other peter
is worth something in the thousands
wild freedom



or ejse he aint worth a cent and
speaking personal i say he aint worth
a cent

 hey cried hank how come
you to talk like that bill dyou ever
see a hoss with the looks that peter

has

  sure responded bill hes got
the looks there aint no doubt of that
but looks aint what a gent can sit a
saddle on matter of fact the man aint
born that can ride peter

  thats fool talk cried hank
why anybody can lead peter around

  whos talking about leading an-
swered bill what good does it do
a gent to have a hoss that he can lead
if he cant ride it and nobody can
ride peter look at sam dunbar
didnt he try his prettiest on peter to-
day but after he got throwed he had
enough he wouldnt go back at
peter

  dunbars nerve is gone said hank
sullenly

 what about your nerve why
didnt you tackle him after he threw

you 

  hank sat silent and glared he was
plainly hunting for words but could find
no retort

  you take my advice said bill
peter has a pile of looks but thats all
all the good hell do vou will be to run
up a feed bill if i had him id turn
him into dog food pronto

  hank sprang to his feet

  boys he said aint there a one
of you that would advance me some-
thing on peter

  they shook their heads

  yet you all wanted him bad enough
when he was running loose when he
was roaming through the hills with that
gang of mustangs you all sure enough
wanted peter bad every man here
rode for him but when i creased him
and got him you say he aint worth
nothing is that sense

  talk for yourself hank they told

him we dont want him all hell
do for a gent is to bust his neck hes
turning into a killer thats the worst
kind-them that are quiet as lambs till
they feel a cinch bite into them they
aint no use ever you got him rope
broke easy but youll never break him
for the saddle if you want some
money put up your gun ill give you
something for that

  hank sneered

  give up my gat with joe saunders
in town he said fiercely i aint
that much of a fool

  then use your gun to turn peter
into dog meat if you want said bill
but dont hold up the game no longer
your deal sam

  hank regarded the others with a con-
centrated malevolence for a moment
but suddenly he jammed his hat upon
his head turned on his heel and strode
from the room

  wrait a minute- began bill

  shut up said sam if he wants
to kill the hoss let him do it before the
hoss kills him and thats what it
would come to one of these days

  but a hoss like peter- began

hank

  i know said sam a hoss like
peter looks like a picture but thats all
the good he is he might as well stay
on the page of a book all the good
he is is to make a pile of talk

  tom recoiled from the wnndow

  so that was to be the end of beauti-
ful peter-a bullet through the head
and then the buzzards

  he stole around the house just as the
back door of it banged and hank
stepped out into the night and walked
straight for the corrals with the speed
and the decision of a man bent on busi-
ness like a moving shadow tom
drifted behind him

  in the corral hank advanced with
a rope and tom saw him go directly
up to peter there was no mistaking
the horse even in the darkness that


western story magazine

noble and beautiful outline bad a light

of its own

  tom wondered to see the great horse
submit so calmly to the rope which was
put around its head then peter was
led out from the corral and tethered to
the fence a gun gleamed in the hand
of hank

  now dang your soul growled
hank youve got out to the end of
your rope and youre going to be
flopped ive stood a whale of a lot
from you take it by and large i put
in six months getting in a shot at you
and when that slug knocked you down
without killing you i sure thought i
was going to make a pile of money out
of you i figured i had the fastest
thing on four feet that was running
through the mountains but you aint
done me no good youve got me
busted im through with you and
heres the end of your trail i might
turn you loose but i aint going to let
it be said that i had that six months
work for nothing

  the gun raised in a steady hand
and tom slipped closer his heart
was hammering at the top of his throat
he could hardly breathe so great was
his fear there was the knife to be
sure but he could not strike it into a
human body-from behind something
in his heart made that impossible yet
if he grappled that man hand to hand
how could he match the matured
strength of hank

  desperately he set his teeth there
was no time to reflect he leaped from
behind and caught hank in his arms

  to his amazement the body of hank
seemed to crumple to water

  strength he knew at a touch that
he could break the man in two but
the sense of power made him gentle
there was only a strangled gasp from
hank as the revolver was torn from his
hand and he was laid upon the ground
peter snorted and stepped back

to be concluded in next weeks issue

  now listen said tom while all his
blood was in a riot from that easy vie-
tory listen  me if you try to call
the others by yelling for them ill send
a slug into you thatll make one less
to follow me if you even try to stand
up ill shoot and you can be mire
that i wont miss i

  ihere was not a word from hank
his body merely stiffened but in the
meantime the possession of that loaded
gun meant a world of added power to
tom he took off the heavy cartridge
belt from his victim he buckled it
around his own hips he dropped the
revolver into the holster then he went
to peter but there seemed to be no
need for his soothing voice the
strength of a rope was a fact which the
stallion had learned first of all from
his contact with men and though he
might be in terror for his life he would
not pull back against it it had burned
into his flesh too often before

  he stood patiently while tom un-
knotted the rope and at the first tug
of the rope against his neck he stepped
out to follow the new master and that
act of obedience thrilled tom with a
sudden and strange gratitude a wealth
of tenderness in his heart of hearts
he vowed that peter should never re-
gret that step he sent a last word to
hank

  im still watching you he called
softly then broke into a jogging run
peter came readily at his heels once
around the edge of the corral he in-
creased the pace to his full speed and
still peter followed without once draw-
ing back on the rope but as lorn
rounded the edge of the cliff from the
top of which he had first had a view of
the horse he heard a sudden hubbub
behind him and voices shouting carry-
ing clearly through the mountain night
the alarm had been given and in an-
other moment the pursuit on horseback
would begin

ld man dunham straight-
ened up his eyes staring
eagerly at the contents of
his pan gold he
whispered almost rever-
ently gold and lots of
it after all these years he walked
somewhat unsteadily to a boulder and
seated himself a strange chill the chill
of excitement surging through his
veins he felt weak and his old heart
increased its beat until it drummed in
his ears for a long time he remained
seated running his gnarled fingers
through the gold spreading it apart
then pushing it together again there
was one big nugget in the pan and this
he lifted and dropped suddenly he
no longer saw the precious metal the
gold pan was there and yet it was not
there instead a picture a beautiful
mental picture of an old lady appeared

  the old lady he whispered softly
my old wopan you can have all the
things you want everything all that
youve waited for all these years an
youll have to admit i was right when
i went north each year i knew it
would come sooner or later suddenly
the pan dropped to the rocks with an
unearthly clatter he buried his face
in his hands then tears trickled be

tween his fingers sobs shook his frame
i thought-thought people cried when
they was sad im cry in and im hap-
pier than i ever was exceptin the day
my old woman and me got married

  at length he straightened picked
up the pan gathered the large nugget
and tucked it into his pocket leaving
the remainder of the gold on the wet
sand to be panned out on the morrow
the day was early and he had earned
a rest for perhaps ten minutes he
remained idle then the desire to work
overwhelmed him and he shoveled
gravel with a fury that would have done
credit to a man many years his junior

  a trick of nature when the country
was undergoing the process of forma-
tion during a bygone age had left a
pocket of gold for centuries it was
undisturbed until old man dunham in
the winter of life discovered it as
he gathered his gold he weighed it
not by the ounce but by the pound
balancing it with a pound can of beans
he had improvised as a scales

  at length came a day when he could
no longer lift the combined weight of
his fortune two hundred pounds in
coarse gold he muttered as he cal-
culated his fortune ill have to go
down to cold deck and get me a horse


western story magazine

or something i cant pack this out on
my back

  with blanket and sufficient grub for
the trip dunham headed for cold
deck his step lighter than it had been
in years once in camp his first move
was to send a letter to the little old
lady who waited outside he concluded
with

  and i wont be moren a month behind this
letter so go right out and buy you a silk
dress or something expensive and have
somebody make if for you dont do it your-
self youve had to do that all your life
and youve a rest coming from now on

  as he posted the letter music came
to his ears faintly he followed the
sound until he paused before the blue
moon the nearest thing that cold deck
had to a  resort within barr pre-
sided his cold eyes measuring every
man in terms of money there were
games of chance-the customer taking
the only chance there was moonshine
liquor cold decks regular united
states marshal was in california for
his health while the man in his place
grafton was a close friend of barr
he blinked his eyes at illegality on
barrs part but promptly arrested all
competitors

  in the offing a storm was hovering
the storm of indignation of cold decks
square citizens sooner or later it
would break and when it did it would
be a deluge about him barr had gath-
ered a choice collection of lieutenants
not to mention a considerable number
of hangers on coming under the general
classification of the ranks there were
a number of holdups which grafton
had been unable to solve so he said
an attempt to wreck the bank had been
thwarted by flapjack meehan and
tubhy willows public opinion had
forced grafton to jail hall the cashier
who was now awaiting trial

  occasionally a citizen blew up and
announced in a loud tone of voice that
things had come to a pretty pass when

a gang of toughs could run a respectable
community the answer was that the
community busy with its own affairs
had not been sufficiently aroused

  without ever dreaming of the part
he was to play in cold decks im-
mediate future old man dunham
listened to the music a moment felt the
longing for companionship and entered
the place barr gave him one search-
ing glance then motioned to his man
friday in this instance called jamison

  theres an old fool with money
he whispered cant you see it in his
eyes hes excited happy hes got
news he wants to tell buts afraid to
find out if hes a friend of meehans
or willows theyre devils for pro-
tecting their old friends if hes no
friend of theirs go the limit trim
him quick

  jamison managed the approach easily
enough lonely dunham responded to
jamisons simple comment on the
weather and the two fell to chatting

  eating at the new deal cafe i
suppose he suggested most of
flapjack meehans friends eat there
when in camp and most of the old-
timers like yourself are his friends
ive heard a lot about meehan and
willows but never happened to meet
em replied dunham and the con-
versation switched to prospecting

  just how it was managed dunham
never knew but the answer is doubt-
less that a tired but happy old man
friendless and longing for companion-
ship responded to the clever moves of
a man who knew human nature

  i aint tollin people where it is
whispered old man dunham but ive
got a right good claim brought in
two thousand dollars in nuggets with
me he paused then chuckled as
carmack once said when he came into
skagway cigar noney

  you dont say replied jamison
with a fine show of astonishment
flapjack meehan rounds em up



hey barr come over and meet a
lucky man

  barrs personal appearance his
warmth was flattering to the simple old
fellow he shook hands two thou-
sand in dust eh he queried say
thats great thats like the old times
im a cheechako myself and never saw
that much in one poke bring it over
and lets see it then as he saw sus-
picion come into the faded eyes he
added with an engaging laugh its
safe enough theres the united states
marshal sitting over there

  well i dont want to create a lot of
excitement replied dunham but id
kinda like to show it to you boys
youve been pretty nice to an old man
you wont say anything to the others
sure not

  while dunham stepped down the
street a short distance to where he was
stopping they made their plans pres-
ently the old man returned with a
fine show of caution barr motioned
him into a back room jamison graf-
ton and one other fellow there she
be he announced with pride

  sure enough agreed barr hefting
the gold he passed it on to grafton
who in turn passed it to jamison sev-
eral others entered unbidden ap-
parently exclaimed over what they saw
and insisted on examining the poke
suddenly it vanished

  wrhos got it queried dunham in
alarm whos got the poke
what poke demanded barr harshly
why boys you dont mean you
aint going to give my poke back that
aint right boys old man dunham
appeared stunned

  i aint seen any poke replied barr
have you boys

naw growled one roughly the
old guys crazy they get that way
when they stay in the hills too long
with sudden fury dunham launched
himself at barr its a skin game

he cried a game to beat an old man
ill have the law on you for this
grafton ordered barr sharply
take him away hes lost his mind
poor devil the others laughed
roughly

  then as dunham gripped barr the
later thrust him back measured the
blow and old man dunham lav
stretched on the floor blood from a
cut lip staining his gray beard two
men picked him up and carried him
into the card room administered first
aid then dumped him outside

  whats wrong several queried
oh nothing explained barr easily
just an old man a little bit off in the
head imagines he has a poke and
thinks we lifted it it took three of
us to hold him but hes all right now
youre a liar

  the charge brought every man to his
feet rough rhodes once a tough
citizen but now a regular fellow in
every respect thanks to flapjack
meehans importing a better man to
beat him up stood with clenched fists
facing barr i repeat youre a liar
barr i heard your man jamison work-
ing on dunham and i saw dunham
bring a poke in under his coat with
that rhodes advanced with the ex-
pressed intention of working barr over
to suit himself despite his own great
strength barr paled grafton stepped
quickly across the room

  cut it out rhodes he snapped
the old mans crazy cut it out or
ill run you in

 you sneered rhodes you
havent got a mind of your own his
fist shot out and the marshal lav
stretched on the floor then he turned
to barr and at the same instant the
air seemed filled with fists slowly
but surely rhodes was forced out of
the blue moon barrs heavy duty gang
of roughs had responded nobly to his
call


western story magazine

  within his private office barr was
talking to his trusted men and talking
fast you grafton get that old fool
in here weve got to get rid of him
even if we bump him off

  im marshal replied grafton and
so long as im in the saddle rhodes or
any one else cant start trouble-trouble
thatll hurt us i mean

  still dazed old man dunham was
brought back before barr im going
to talk to you and talk fast dunham
you know where morningside is
well its the place where they confine
alaskans who go insane thats where

youre going-

  my old woman gasped out dun-
ham

  you never will see that old woman
youre always raving about if you once
get into morningsider continued barr
and thats where youre going the
marshal here can put you there in a

hurry unless-

  unless what

  unless you tell us where you found
that gold and get out of cold deck
ah then i did show you a poke
shouted dunham

  sure you did but the boys dont
know it they think youre crazy and
when were through with you youll act
like it threatened barr whats the
answer

  ill see you to the devil first
shouted dunham i aint never quit
before a crook yet and i aint going
to begin at my time of life

  there was murder in barrs eyes as
he dropped dunham with a blackjack
take him away to jail grafton
were into this business to our necks
now if dunhams allowed to talk
theres no telling where itll stop old
man dunham was carried out the back
way this time and pitched into a cell
behind those heavy doors much could
take place that the public would never
hear of so long as grafton was in
charge

  rough rhodes alone remained at
large to make trouble and he could
make trouble enough for a dozen barrs
once he got his stride the memory
of the horror in dunhams eyes as ban-
told him he was insane was sufficient
to keep rhodes at the exploding point
for many hours thereafter he was
vengeance personified as he charged
into the new deal cafe next morn-
ing

  were  going to have a round-up
within forty-eight hours he told flap-
jack meehan and tubby willows force-
fully theres a cuss in this camp
thats been piling straw on the camels
back for some time

  and hes put on the last straw
suggested tubby

  straw he tossed on a whole bale
last night stole a poke of dust from
a miner and when he kicked they beat
him up and put him in jail hes there
now charged with insanity pass the
word among the decent crowd of cold
deck that theres going to be a meeting
on the dock to-night to settle this once
and for all cold deck was a good
camp until barr and his crowd arrived
and were not going to turn it over to
them barr wrecked the bank and
hall the cashier will serve time tor
it barrs been running a crooked place
as you found out flapjack theres a
lot of things hes done including mur-
der that we cant prove but we can
prove this am i right

  you are and im with you agreed
flapjack

  same here rejoined tubby well
pass the word along to the right people
most of em eat here better make it
eight oclock to-night eh

  fine said rhodes and he hurried
off

  cold deck was calm and peaceful on
the surface but throughout the day the
opposing sides in camp quietly gathered
forces a few organized men can run
a city with a show of force barr told
flapjack meehan rounds em up



his men and were organized every
man a he-man and not a lot of mer-
chants office men and half-baked simps
with water in their veins size up their
crowd then look our own over and see
if you dont think well be in the saddle
when the storm breaks and the mar-
shal is on our side dont forget that
better sweep out your jail grafton
therell be quite a crowd in for dis-
turbing the peace after to-night-dis-
turbing our peace

  grafton laughed shes ready for
anybody with a special cell for mee-
han rhodes and willows

  it sometimes happens that men sit
over a volcano figuratively speaking
and fail to realize it while every one
was more or less in sympathy with
rhodes indignation and all were pre-
pared to take drastic action the ma-
jority headed for the meeting prepared
for nothing more exciting than some
hot speeches rhodes poked his head
into the new deal cafe at quarter to
eight cornin he queried

  ill be right with you in ten min-
utes rhodes said flapjack tubbys
going to stay and keep shop

  ill see you down there then re-
plied rhodes i want to look em over
as they come onto the dock dont want
any spies at our meeting

  at five minutes to eight barr looked
over the group that had gathered at
the blue moon and smiled come on
boys and see the fun im going to
attend the meeting on the dock wasnt
invited but im going he picked
up a winchester rifle that hung in his
office and stalked out

  flapjack meehan left the new deal
cafe almost at the same instant bet-
ter take your forty-four shouted
tubby

  naw retorted flapjack things
like that dont happen this is an in-
dignation meeting and i can be in-
dignant without my forty-four be

back in about a half hour and tell you
what happened

  flapjack heard the tread of many
feet as he stepped onto the dock ahead
of him was rough rhodes half way
down the dock and behind him--

  a rifle barrel cracked flapjack
sharply on the arm get out of the
way meehan growled barr an in-
stant later he had brushed by his head
lowered with rage his rifle cocked
ready for action behind came his
gang some armed some without
weapons they paused uncertain
at the dock

  go on back barr this isnt your
meeting ordered rhodes well re-
port the meetings action to you in due
time the butt of a gun was visible
in a holster at rhodes side

  barrs reply was suddenly to swing
the rifle about and fire that for your
interfering in my affairs he snarled
the roar almost in his ears deafened
rhodes but his hand caught the rifle
and swung it clear as barr fired again
rhodes gun barked and a bullet tore
its wav through barrs arm with a
howl of pain and defiance barr jerked
the rifle loose and fired again the
crack of the revolver was drowned in
the report of the rifle barr pitched
forward his rifle beneath him rhodes
crumpled up at the same instant

  im done flapjack im done he
cried as flapjack reached his side

 quick wheres your gnn
shouted flapjack as he cursed himself
for leaving his own weapon behind

  im done for old friend groaned
rhodes then as he rolled over flap-
jack caught sight of the revolver

  if either side opened up flapjack
was in the line of fire and he knew it
with rhodes gun in his hand he faced
barrs crowd the men were hesitat-
ing a leader at that moment could
have brought them forward but the
leader was not forthcoming it was an
old situation for flapjack clear out
so

western story magazine

while youre all together he shouted
advancing with waving weapon
barrs dead and the men on the dock
will open up any moment get one
man broke away and slunk into the
crowd as it fearing he would be recog-
nized then in disorder they fled an-
other mob of angry men was pouring
from the dock buildings ready for any-
thing tender hands picked up rhodes
and carried him on an improvised
stretched to the hospital

  as if by common consent the men
gathered about flapjack meehan
were taking over the running of this
town meehan and the first thing to do
is to appoint an unofficial marshal the
next is to organize a posse to round
up barrs gang and the next is
to ship em out of town ex-
cept jamison and grafton they should
be prosecuted flapjack recognized
the voice as that of judge tuttle
youre right shouted a dozen men
i move flapjack meehan be made
marshal continued judge tuttle

  a hundred voices roared in second-
ing the motion

  flapjack was serious as he worked
his way from the crowd then called
out twenty or thirty men he knew
would make a good posse get your
guns and clear out you know who
the men are we want he told them
then he detached himself from the
crowd slipped away unobserved and
entered the new deal cafe through the
back door he discarded rhodes gun
and strapped on his old and tried forty-
fours then headed for the jail when
he entered it was with both guns ready
for action

  whats this demanded grafton
youre covering the united states
marshal

  its about the size of it replied
flapjack keep em high

  from a manner born of experience
flapjack deftly removed the others

weapons appropriated his badge and
keys then locked him in one of the cells
youre going to stand trial for a num-
ber of things hello boys youre
working fast this last remark was
addressed to two members of the posse
who came in with the roulette-wheel
man and jamison

  they were put in the large cell with
grafton and the posse hurried away
from time to time during the night
they returned flapjack turned an
empty building into a temporary jail
for the doubtless cases but the main
offenders were crowded into cold deck
jail and tubby willows was made head
jailer with full powers

  around cold decks hospital men
stepped softly the next day few real-
ized just how much they cared for
rough rhodes-big good-natured
handsome kid-until the story leaked
out of how he had taken up an old
mans battle dunham rather dazed
from his experience had iten released
at once but rhodes was fighting for his
life they gathered around in groups
only to cast baleful glances at the hos-
pital if rhodes dies- growled

one the other nodded their sympathetic
understanding

  rumors flew thick and fast regarding
his condition until along toward night-
fall the word came that saddened the
whole camp then filled the men with a
cold uncontrollable rage rhodes is
dead in an instant the camp was
turned into a mob seeking vengeance

  somewhere in the hills b lap jack
meehan was rounding up the remainder
of barrs gang before the jail stood
tubby willows with drawn forty-
fours dont do it boys it was
a plea and a threat youre seem red
now crowds are always that way
when theyve been tramped on by a
bunch of crooks and their ire gets up
to-morrowll be different

  rhodes is dead came from a score
flapjack meehan rounds em up



of voices it was like throwing pitch
into flames

  the mob surged closer back up
boys warned tubby were going
to give these men a trial and a fair
one im with you in spirit but not
in action back up

  from above a rope dropped a
former cowman had cleverly roped
tubby a half dozen men on the jail
roof pulled him clear of the ground
with a will his forty-fours vanished
they searched his pockets and demanded
the keys to the jail i threw em
away he told them angrily figured
something like this would happen
then they trussed him up and carried
him to an old building tubby was
dropped unceremoniously on the floor
and the door locked

  a heavy timber borne aloft on many
shoulders thundered against the jail
while within the prisoners blood
chilled at the sound a fearful clatter
arose as the door crashed in men
pushed fought and were crushed from
the pressure behind as they sought to
get within the building inside the
struggling mass attacked the cell doors
theyd have them down in short order
the prisoners knew

  grafton was shaking with fear
jamison was ashen the roulette man
alone was calm he looked judge tut-
tle squarely in the eye tuttle had been
carried along on the crest of the wave
pleading for law and order the man
thrust a draft into tuttles hands a
moment before the door gave way
give it to old man dunham he
shouted its for five hundred dol-
lars where im going i wont need
it

  well bless my soul gasped out
tuttle youre a cool one

  many hands reached within and
clawed at the trio of wretches

  a rope a rope screamed some
one three of em yelled another
like some writhing snake seeking a
d-w

victim a rope came through the crowd
then another and another

  a howl such as few men hear in a
lifetime filled the air as the men were
dragged into the open grafton had
to be supported jamison held himself
together with difficulty only the roul-
ette man viewed the proceedings calmly
again came the mad yell

  flapjack meehan returning writh
more prisoners and a posse heard the
yelling and read its meaning theyre
lynching them he cried aghast you
men keep these prisoners out of the
mobs sight and remember boys
youre sworn officers no matter what
your personal feelings are

  with this terse command flapjack
was running toward the tumult as
he fought his way through the outer
edge of the mob an electric light cross-
arm took on a newt and sinister aspect
a coil of rope shot through the air
and over the cross-arm men leaped
high to be first to catch the dangling
end a hoarse shout came from mad
throats and a figure shot upward
swinging round and round grotesquely
wise in the way of crowds flapiack
worked through using every possible
means to keep his unexpected presence
secret lest he be held helpless until the
work was done when panting he
burst through into the open his forty-
four roared and the squirming figure
dropped to the ground gasping it
was grafton

  when the significance of the shot
dawned upon them flapjacks back was
to the wall grafton lay on the ground
beneath his feet jamison leaned against
the wall like a tired man the third
stood erect it dont go boys cried
flapjack we dont do things this
way nowadays back up  back up
theres innocent men among the pris-
oners and in the long days that are to
come you dont want to look back on
this night and remember that you
lynched an innocent man
western story magazine



  theres no doubt about those three
birds yelled a hoarse voice and the
crowd echoed its confirmation and
theyre the ones were lynching

  i see a lot of good friends among
you but ill shoot if you rush me and
x can shoot boys eleven shots re-
mainin in these two forty-fours and
that means eleven good men gone for
the lords sake boys dont make me
do it

  a wild-eyed man burst through
jerked the rope from jamisons neck
and advanced on flapjack you did
a good job in the round-up meehan
now its up to the citizens to finish

  never shouted flapjack it was
the tightest situation of his long life
on the frontier he determined to save
his prisoners yet to shoot to kill was
the last thing he wanted to do or would
do

  then wed better string up the
marshal first yelled the man as if
in approval of this a light line settled
over flapjacks head and was pulled
taut he switched his tactics emphas-
izing each sentence with his forty-fours
however

  you cant hang me and you know
it that rope isnt strong enough and
the pole isnt high enough he shouted

  somebody laughed was it the be-
ginning of a change in sentiment
flapjack prayed that it was there
isnt a half dozen yellow men in the
crowd he went on could you look
yourself in the eye every time you
shaved in the years to come and re-
member that youd help string up a
yellow cur like this at my feet do
men do such things could you hang
a thing like jamison too weak from
fear to stand and could you hang a
real man a bad man it is true but a
real man nevertheless who stands look-
ing you fearlessly in the eye with a rope
around his neck dont it go against
the grain to team up on a man like
that he ran a crooked roulette wheel

but hes not cringing now flapjack
seemed to forget he had a rope around
his own neck think it over boys

  then as if the crowd no longer ex-
isted was no longer a menace flap-
jack ignored them get up he or-
dered grafton poking him with the toe
of his boot help him up jamison
he said in a low voice two minutes
from now it may too late they pulled
grafton to his feet a reeling thing that
had faced death fearfully come on
he ordered and led the way men fell
back and marshal and prisoners filed
through the silent throng-a throng that
followed them back to jail

  in front of the jail door stood six
grim men with sawed-off shotguns
flapjacks deputies who had slipped
around to the jail ready to head off
any further raid put up your guns
boys he ordered and go home ive
talked it over with the crowd and
theyve decided to let the law take its
course as fair-minded men should

  suddenly he man who had favored
hanging flapjack commenced cheering
nor was he long alone the same throats
that had yelled for a killing a few min-
utes before now applauded nerve
each somehow felt that he had been
put on his honor

  dont cheer me boys shouted
flapjack it wasnt what i said it
was what our own better judgment
told you a mans better judgment is
always right if hell stop a minute and
listen

  and you made us stop yelled some
one

  with a big cannon in each hand
chimed in another

  sav yelled a third youd better
go over to that shack and let tubby
willows out some of us trussed him
up and stuck him in there but we re
afraid to go back now hed kill us

 it was two weeks later rough
rhodes whose close approach to death
flapjack meehan rounds em up

had caused various rumors and no little
excitement now stood before an admir-
ing crowd ahem began flapjack
meehan shortly after the near-
lynching when a lot of men ii cold
deck still supposed you were dead and
not suffering from a flesh wound and
shock they took up a collection to buy
you a swell tombstone you wont need
it for some time so we took the money
and bought the best watch in cold deck
well give it to you then you give it
back and well send it outside to be
engraved

  rhodes bowed grinned foolishly
and vanished

 old man dunham motioned him
down an alley where stood an ancient



horse with a heavy load right glad
to see you alive son dont tell no-
body but theys a good fortune in dust
on that crow bait im hitting for the
states and my old woman lord love
her to show i didnt forget what you
done for me here is the location no-
tices of a claim i staked for you right
below mine i panned her one day and
heres what i got

  holy smoke gasped out rhodes
as he looked at the nuggets well
you old devil

  with a whoop of joy rough rhodes
threw both arms around old man dun-
ham and hugged him then spoke feel-
ingly as the movement caused a twitch
of pain to shoot through his wound

colorado has a new addition to her mountain parks

ry he newest addition to the mountain park system of denver colorado
 daniels park was presented to the city over a year ago by mr charles
macallister willcox it lias an area of forty acres and is situated at the top
of a ridge on wildcat mountain about eighteen miles south of denver in many
respects daniels park is the most beautiful of the entire chain of mountain
parks in this part of the state westward toward the rockies it lias an in-
comparable view which takes in more than one hundred and fifty miles of the
from range of the rockies and gives an amazingly beautiful glimpse of the
intervening valleys and plains to the south east and west the view extends
for two hundred miles on days when the atmosphere is most favorable the
park department under the direction of superintendent a k vickery has
recently completed a large shelter house a dozen outdoor ovens numerous con-
crete and stone tables and a replica of cliff dwellers ruins and many other
improvements for the park are being contemplated for the near future

nd why said mcnicol
the storekeeper at the
portage eying skookum
eill hutchins and his
partner old sam dobbs
coldly why should i give
ye a winters grubstake on credit
what have ye done with the bag of
dust ye washed out of von bar on the
kachika 

  skookum bill standing on the floor
scales slid the weight along the beam
until it balanced two hundred and
seventeen i weigh he said with satis-
faction for he was proud of his big
hard body and the tremendous strength
which had earned him his sobriquet
what did we do with that dust mc-
nicol why we blowed it how long
dyou expect one little poke to last two
growed-iip men she wasnt no bo-
nanza nor forty mile that bar come
on mcnicol you know us were
good for it we aint out to do you
yell no doubt know the proverb
concernin good intentions and the pit
said mcnicol skeptically ill not
grubstake ye to lie in idleness all win-
ter so that ye may strike me for a
spring outfit on the same terrums

  you got an awful suspicious mind
mcnicol said skookum bill in in-

jured tones i spose bein scotch
you cant help it but you wrong us
i couldnt snapped mcnicol im
under no delusions whatever respectin
the pair of ye

  which was so true that old dobbs
interposed diplomatically

  bill didnt mean nothin mcnicol
said he hed orter told you what
were goin to do we dont aim to
hole up for the winter we want to
git us an outfit and trap

  ye might have said so at first said
the trader and where will ye trap
dobbs hesitated and shook his head
wed tell you if we told any one
but we aint givin that away he said
with an air of honest regret we know
a district thats simply crawlin with
fur and dont look iike its never been
trapped only shes a long hard trail
and as there aint no cornin out in the
winter we want a pretty fair outfit and
we want to start right away

  mcnicol looked him in the eye but
dobbs met his gaze squarely he was
a hard old bird was dobbs lean and
cunning and though the chickens ol a
sinful youth and prime were beginning
to roost upon his bald head and stooping
shoulders-to say nothing of certain in-
ternal pains perhaps attributable to their

scratching claws-he was still able to
keep the pace which was set by his
partner bill hutchins and skookum
bill in a land of hard men was noted
for strength activity endurance and
especially cussedness mcnicol sud-
denly shifted his gaze to the face of
the latter

  thats right bill corroborated
shes a long trip like sam says
pick out what ye want said mc-
nicol but remember if there are no
furs to show for it yell never get an-
other dollar of credit from me

  and so when hutchins and dobbs
emerged from the store they were the
possessors of sufficient general supplies
to last until the next spring which
considering that they were flat broke
and had reputations that would ignite
safety matches was a striking testi-
mony to the elastic credit of the
country

  easiern i thought grinned skoo-
kum bill as he sliced tobacco from a
huge new plug

  what did you want to make that
crack about him bein scotch for sam
remonstrated

   well he is bill replied

  that aint no reason for remindin
him of it said dobbs  specially when
you want credit

  why scotchmen is mostly proud of
just bein scotch said bill but
darned if i could ever see why he
added

  nor me dobbs said anyway
you near queered the deal if i hadnt
jumped in right then hed have turned
us down

  youre a good offhand liar his
partner conceded frankly but what
arc we goin to do with al them traps
course we might trade them off for
something we want

  whats the matter with usin them
ourselves dobbs suggested

  who us said bill in amaze-
ment traps

  sure said dobbs why not
no reason why not bill returned
only i hadnt thought of it i aint
trapped for a good while and i was
thinkin wed put in an easy winter
furs scarce around here and i aint
goin to kill myself for a few skins
course not dobbs agreed but
heres the proposition bill weve
made the bluff to mcnicol and you
heard what he said we may need him
to stake us again weve sure got to
show him some fur in the spring now
weve alius wanted to git up into that
country around the headwaters of the
frances early in the year when the
water in the creeks was low sos we
could wash gravel from the bars weve
alius figgered they was gold there we
can hit there before freeze-up and win-
ter all right and have a look around
likely theres as much fur there as
they is anywhere and anyway when
you aint got no money for the winter
its just as well to go some place where
you wont need none

  now hutchins and dobbs were pros-
pectors-or rather gold seekers-first
last and all the time the uncertain
game held them in the grip of its fas-
cination and though they cursed and
grumbled at the life they loved it oc-
casionally they were forced to turn their
versatile hands to other things and had
even when times were very hard in-
deed descended and condescended to
regular employment for wages wliich
they considered a degradation to be ex-
cused only by stern necessity but their
hearts were in the hills and valleys and
basins and nameless creeks where a man
might chance upon yellow fortune
among the sand and gravel albeit the
chance was less than one in ten thou-
sand no rumor was too will-o-the-
wisp for them to chase and on the
well-known theory that far-away fields
are the greenest they were continually
making long hard trips into unknown
country whence they usually returned
si

western story magazine

cursing bitterly and outrageously only
to try again elsewhere with little better

success and so skookum bill found
his partners suggestion alluring

  thats so he said youre right
about them creeks ill bet theres bars
tliatd pay big if they could be got at
and as you say we have to winter
somewheres might as well do it there
and be in for the spring low water

  neither mentioned nor indeed
thought of the circumstance that the
district referred to was in the very
heart of a frozen wilderness that it was
hard to get into even when the water-
ways were open and practically im-
possible to get out of when these were
closed by frost and that in the event of
sickness or accident a man must de-
pend principally upon providence and
his own constitution to pull him
through neither bill nor sam leaned
very strongly upon providence-though
sam when drunk exhibited religious
tendencies or rather a tendency to
mourn his lack of them through life-
but each had a well-founded and abid-
ing faith in his own physical powers
and so neither saw anything out of the
way in the prospect of a winter of re-
mote loneliness

  a couple of days later they left the
portage in a sixteen-foot peterboro
loaded to within two inches of the
gunwale and so almost as unstable as
a floating log but since both were
used to the vagaries of such craft they
felt as secure as if it had been a york
bot and paddled up the long reaches
without undue exertion camping when
it suited them and living royally on
fish flesh and fowl aided by a supply
of rum so much overproof that it would
almost have floated a horseshoe but
this luxury was also in the nature of
medical stores and in the long winter
ahead contingencies might arise in
which it would prove very valuable
indeed

  no more after to-night said bill

at the end of a week pouring a frugal
portion into a tin cup no more till
ri hanksgiving bar accidents

  i hat goes dobbs agreed regret-
fully duplicating the action but any-
how bill heres to accidents 

   but though at first their rate of prog-
ress was slow and its manner indolent
as the days went by a change came upon
them especially noticeable in the
younger man skookum bill

  this manifested itself in stiff er
thrusts of paddle against the current
in a gradually increasing tension of
body and mind against the natural ob-
stacles to their progress in later goings
ashore at night  camp in earlier up-
risings they were in fact in the grip
of the long trail and bill hutchins
magnificent muscles seemed to string
themselves to meet an added demand

  in the stern of the low-laden canoe
his paddle swished steadily and power-
fully with thrust of straight stiff upper
arm backed by a twisting swing of the
body from the waist and with every
stroke the little craft leaped as if a
giant hand had shoved her forward
in the bow old dobbs fought the
stream cunningly twisting the nose into
eddies and backwaters taking advan-
tage when he could of set of current
and when he could not paddling dog-
gedly not so powerfully perhaps as
his partner but with equal steadiness

  and so in due course they approached
the destination the nights were now
cold gemmed with a multitude of bright
stars uncanny with the querulous wail
of coyotes and the occasional deep
voices of wolves in the mornings hoar-
frost lay thick upon the ground and
thin ice formed in currentless shallows
and overlay the muskrat runways in
the sloughs and ponds die rush-and-mud
houses of these little workers were
bound solidly along the river freshl
felled and barked trees told of the ac-
tivity of beaver and in slow current
and in eddies the tops of their winter 
a thousand a plate



food supply lay like submerged brush
fences projecting above the surface
day by day the trees became barer and
the stream was littered with yellow
wind-stripped leaves geese passed
overhead and wild fowl from the
breeding grounds of the farther north
wisped along the lonely waterway
plainly winter was at hand

  just as well we started when we

did said bill no tellin when shell
tighten up

  may do it any time sam agreed

  they turned up the frances where
the water was shallow and swift
creeks were numerous and timber was
plentiful on either hands were hills
and more hills in waves of unknown
ranges seamed by swift waterways
notched by passes and here the ad-
venturers went ashore unloaded turned
their canoe bottom up in the shelter of
thick brush and cached their supplies
temporarily on a pole scaffold out of
reach of prowling depredators

  they had never been in that precise
country before and they had not the
least idea of the surrounding topog-
raphy save that it seemed to have con-
siderable ups and downs but neverthe-
less they felt quite satisfied and at
home

  for fur said dobbs we ort to get
back in them hills theres better tim-
ber and if theres pay in the creeks
shell be higher up

  all right bill acquiesced well
take a couple of blankets and some
grub and namtch round for a couple of
days till we find a place to suit us

  carrying light packs they left camp
at daylight the next morning trails
there were none but they followed the
general course of a small creek crossed
a divide and dipped down into a beau-
tifully timbered valley watered by a
swift large creek of almost riverlike
dimensions they were thus between
the first range of hills and the second
and much higher up than where they

had landed looking to right and left
from the summit before they had be-
gun the descent the valley had lain as
far as they could see in thick timber
and open natural meadows and they
could see also gaps in the hills prob-
ably indicating tributary streams

  looks good to me said bill
well just go up her to-morrow and
see what we can find there ort to be
fur here

  now fur-bearing animals are the
shyest of living things and one may
very easily wander for days in their
natural habitat and see none of them
and yet most of the time one will be
under the observation of beady little
eyes and twitching pointed noses and
small furred ears it is one thing to
be morally certain that one is in an ex-
cellent fur district and quite another to
prove it apart from actual results in
trapping beaver and rats have visible
habitations and their fecundity is their
chief guarantee against extinction but
the fox the marten the mink the otter
the lynx and the weasel do not ad-
vertise their abodes for the most part
their habits are nocturnal and their
trails before the snow usually invisible
now and then an odd member of the
clans may be seen for an instant but as
a rule the would-be trapper cruising
for a good district draws general con-
clusions from the lie of the land the
timber the streams and its remoteness
or otherwise as bearing on the likeli-
hood of its having been trapped before

  but skookum bill and old sam al-
though they were primarily gold seek-
ers knew the angles of the trapping
game very well and in a couple of days
cruising up and down the valley they
found sufficient sign to render them
jubilant

  course its mighty hard to tell till
weve put out a few traps said the
former but it looks to me like weve
struck it lucky

  you bet dobbs agreed i dont


western story magazine

believe this here valley ever was
trapped we aint come across no sign
of any old camp-not so much as a
blazed tree i wouldnt wonder if we
was the only wliite men that ever was
in here-or injuns either ill bet well
take out a caaoeload of prime fur mar-
ten ort to be dark in here among this
timber

  shell be some chore packin the
outfit in over that summit bill ob-
served theres snow there now but
there aint enough for a toboggan and
then shes blame steep well have to
pack it on our backs two trips ort
to do

  well-old dobbs clawed his beard
dubiously-im gettin a leetle short in
the wind bill with a load theys
times when my back dont feel right i
cant pack like i could twenty years
ago or ten-nor even five

  i can said skookum bill with the
proud confidence of wonderful and un-
diminished strength i aint never hit
my limit yet i could pack three hun-
dred in over that summit if i could get
it to set right course though i aint
goin to try for no records well both
go over and you take what you can
pack easy and ill take a good load and
well both come back then ill fetch
over the outfit in two or three trips
while youre buildin a cabin well
build her right here thisll be our
home camp if we have to wetl string
two or three line camps up or down
as we need em

  they returned from their canoe
heavily laden and dobbs set about
building a cabin in a sheltered spot
near the creek his tools were an ax
and an auger the sides of the build-
ing were of small logs chinked with
grass and moss and the roof was of
shakes split from straight-grained wood
having no stove they were forced to
depend for heat on a fireplace made of
sticks laid in clay dobbs added two

bunks a table and two stools and sur-
veyed his work with some pride

  shell do he said

  good enough for a millionaire
skookum bill agreed and now let
her snow and be durned

  but for a time she refused to
snow day after day was bright and
breathless the air diy and clear ever
the nights grew colder the ponds
were skinned over with new ice clear
and tough which rang musically to the
impact of a blow as a thin goblet rings
when iapped gently with the knife
blade the ground was a carpet of
leaves rustling noisily beneath the soft-
est foot but bill killed a blacktail
and so they had meat fish were plen-
tiful and so with the larder full they
waited for the snow  for until it should
come revealing the telltale trails and
runways of the furred peoples it would
be waste of time to set many traps

  this waiting was of a deadly mo-
notony skookum bill full of restless
tireless energy when on the trail now
passed to the other extreme he slept
like a dog sixteen hours a day rising
to eat and smoke and then falling back
in his bunk where he coiled himself
very much like a hibernating bear he
was stupid with sleep drugged with it
and he did absolutely nothing leaving
all the work to his partner

  dobbs whose advancing years had
diminished his capacity for sleep did
not grumble even inwardly he was
accustomed to his partners extremes
of sloth of action and of dissipation
and he knew that sooner or later the
big man would do much more than his
share of work and so he cooked and
cut wood and washed up and played
solitaire and lay sleepless for hours in
liis bunk it would be very pleasant
and strictly conventional to state that
in these hours of darkness and sleep-
lessness his mind reverted to the days
of his innocent childhood and that he
sighed bitterly over the years of his
a thousand a plate



misspent life in fact however he did
nothing of the sort if he had ever
had an innocent childhood he had for-
gotten all about it save when drunk
he was unsentimental unrepentant and
irreligious and instead of regretting
his somewhat lurid past he occupied
himself in building air castles which
should have been promptly closed by
the air police

  at last the snow came on the wings
of a northwest wind which had switched
suddenly from southerly gales old
dobbs lying in his bunk noted the
short lull in the whining straining
aeolian notes and their recommence-
ment from another quarter later he
found himself cold and drew another
blanket over him in the morning it
was still blowing great guns and when
he had made up the fire he opened the
door on a world of swirling wind-
driven whiteness whereat he cackled
joyously and informed his comatose
partner that it was snowing like per-
dition  a simile which though possibly
inaccurate according to accepted au-
thorities was fairly descriptive of
weather conditions

  skookum bill opened gummed eyes
and profanely commanded him to shut
the door he stretched yawned pro-
foundly heaved himself out of his
bunk and dressed himself a process
which was confined to and completed
by the drawing on of trousers and
moccasins after which he ate a huge
breakfast of flapjacks and venison lit
his pipe and had a look at the weather

  blizzard he announced cant do
nothin till she stops and having
stated this obvious fact he lay down
and went to sleep again

  for two days the storm raged and
when it ceased and the sun shone again
they seemed to be in a new world daz-
zlingly white wiped clean of familiar
landmarks the swift river was frozen
across the cabin itself was no more

than a mound in the snow traveling
thenceforth must be done on the webs

  but with the snow trails before in-
visible would be plain to read and so
they loaded themselves with traps
bait blankets and started to lay out
their line they had brought a good
supply of steel traps of assorted sizes
but they used also the old-fashioned
primitive deadfall which though it tak-s
time to construct is just as effective
and much more humane though the lat-
ter consideration did not operate on
their minds at all

  as they progressed they found sign
in abundance the trails of the fur
bearers from the huge muffled pads of
the lynx to the dainty mouselike fleet of
the weasel were everywhere never
had either of them seen the like

  fur exclaimed skookum bill
its here to burn

  a reglar garden of eden  said old
dobbs whose scriptural recollections
were somewhat misty dont look like
its ever been trapped and nobody
knows of it but us wed oner make
a clean-up

  itll beat prospectin said bill
and it did in the weeks that fol-
lowed they gathered store of fur not
only in quantity but in quality beyond
their wildest dreams and when one
day they took a veritable black fox from
a trap they felt that at last fortune
was treating them according to their
deserts the animal was large his coat
perfect and they skinned him carefully
and reverently and that night they
celebrated fittingly in the precious rum

  that there black dog said skoo-
kum bill nodding at the stretching
skin dont know his own luck hes
due to wind himself round the neck
of an empress or a princess or a dancer
or somethin and have her rub her
cheek onto his hide and thats a durn
sight more than you or me will ever
have sam

was not verbal he picked up the rum
shot the cork tight with a blow of his
fist and placed it behind his bunk

  what you doin dobbs asked i
want another drink

  you wont get it bill replied with
finality youre drunk

  i aint dobbs denied indignantly
me why i aint said a word about
religion yet i guess i know my own
stages by this time

  when an old rooster like you gets
to talkin about a moral life its time he
quit drinkin bill observed and
anyway we aint goin to mop up all we
got we want to save some for
thanksgiving and in case of sickness
were both healthy dobbs urged
thats all right said bill some
time you come in wet and froze and
played out and the first thing you know
you got a shakin chill and a pain in
your chest and the makins of pneu-
monia what you goin to do if you
havent any liquor

  chrishun science said old dobbs
resourcefully

  christian blazes snorted bill
oont talk back to me i got you
si washed right now go to bed and so-
ber off

  it was a week after the taking of the
black fox that skookum bill on a short
exploring trip a few miles west of their
cabin came across a deadfall which
held a dead marten he took the mar-
ten and when he returned said to
dobbs

  i didnt know youd built any dead-
falls in the timber past the big draw
i havent said dobbs

hey bill exclaimed sure you
have thats where i got this marten
lant help it dobbs returned 
aint got a trap there i aint been in
that timber a-tall

  somebody has bill stated flatly
theres the marten and i seen snow-
shoe tracks course i thought they was
yours

  well they aint dobbs said posi-
tively

  then bill declared with an oath
somebodys trapping on our ground
the first statement was obviously
true though the partners proprietary
rights might be open to doubt but
custom has arranged a trappers modus
vivendi by which a mans right is ordi-
narily recognized to the territory cov-
ered by his traps and such right is
jealously guarded seemingly here was
an intruder who was violating custom
moreover the partners had come to
look upon this exceedingly rich district
as their exclusive property and so
their indignation was extreme

  the low-down ornery cuss said
dobbs the nerve of him crowdin
in on us just as if there wasnt lots of
other places for him to go

  i shd say so bill concurred
here we go to all the trouble of wind-
in a new district where we wont in-
terfere with no one and this blasted
wolverine comes in and sets his traps
right on top of us well hes got to
roll his blankets thats all theres
some things i wont stand 
a thousand a plate



  sure said dobbs he aint actin
right theres plenty of men been shot
for less

  so there has bill agreed only
we	want to shoot him unless we

have to its got so lately that theres
trouble about such things same time
we aint goin to let him keep on stealin
fur from us to-morrow well go and
run him to his hole and find out
whether hes a nitche or a white man

  early in the morning they shouldered
light packs took their rifles crossed
the big draw and entered the timber
where was the deadfall

  it aint mine said dobbs positively
i never notched a stick that way in
my life and look at them snowshoe
tracks theyre longer v narrower
than mine and the webbins different

  proof conclusive and so they took
up the strangers trail it led west and
when darkness fell they had not reached
its end on the way they found half
a dozen traps which they destroyed
that night they slept out uncomfort-
ably and he next day about noon
they found a cabin very similar to their
own standing in the shelter of thick
spruce there was no smoke and
bills hail met with no response they
lifted the wooden latch and peered in
the owner was not at home though the
cabin was evidently occupied

  one white man said bill after a
brief inspection out on his line i
spose and theres no tellin when hell
be back so we wont wait well just
serve notice on him

  the ultimatum which bill indited and
which they jointly and severally sub-
scribed was succinct lucid and peremp-
tory and read

  no traping alowed east of that washout
crcek that is our ground kepe of it by
order	w hutchins

s dobbs esq

  leaving this on the table weighted
with a stick of firewood they returned
to their own camp having thus de-

clared themselves they considered it up
to the intruder and so they were not
surprised when he appeared at their
camp two days later

  he proved to be a somewhat hard-
faced gentleman of about dobbs age
with a cold eye and a bent mouth he
carried a rifle of a recent model and
it was noticeable that every loop of his
cartridge belt contained a shell with-
out preliminaries he introduced himself
as jake flint

  i spose said mr flint morosely
youre the two pelicans that put it up
i cant trap east of that washout creek
and you spose dead right said
skookum bill truculently thats our
ground

  homestead queried mr flint
with elaborate iron when do you
prove up

  right away-for you bill re-
torted thats our ground because
were trappin that district and we aint
goin to stand for no one else there
and so said mr flint you go
and bust up my traps

  you bet we do bill replied and
what you goin to do about it hey
the older man eyed him for a mo-
ment balefully im goin to set em
again he replied and dont you touch
em im goin to trap where i dura
please theres two of you but you
dont bluff me out not any

  bluff hey said skookum bill if
you got her sized up for a bluff go
ahead but dont holler at the show-
down what we said in that notice
goes

  im goin ahead flint stated
calmly i wasnt born in the woods
to be scared by no horned owl you
go lookin for trouble round my illahee
and youre durn apt to get it and
thats all i got to say to you

  with which flat declaration he de-
parted three days afterward the part-
ners discovered traps which were not
theirs east of the washout creek which

was the dead line these they de-
stroyed with curses and threats but
to their vast indignation a short time
after a like fate befell a dozen of their
own traps thus it was evident that
flint was not afraid to play even

  and that settles it said bill wrath-
fully hes callin for a show-down
and hell sure get it im goin to natt-
itch down around his illahee you keep
camp i may be away some nights
what you goin to do dobbs
asked

  i aint goin to shoot him bill re-
plied im just goin to give him a
sorter hint to move out

  without further explanation he de-
parted and did not return till the end
of the third day

  well  dobbs asked somewhat anx-
iously

  well-what bill growled

  what did you do

  burned him out

  gosh old dobbs exclaimed in awe
for in that remote wilderness such a
deed was little less than murder not
-not the whole jing-bang bill you
left him something

  i was fool enough to skookum
bill admitted i waited till he was
out on his line cause i didnt want to
shoot him i held him out some grub
and his bed and all the matches he had
he has part of a deer hung up so he
has lots of meat and he has a little
toboggan with him with luck he ought
to make somewheres if he starts right
away i could

  youre young and strongern a
moose dobbs pointed out durned if
i believe i could make it alone and
hes about as old as me

  hes got a chance his partner re-
plied doggedly he had fair warning
lots of men would have shot him an
injun would in a holy minute

  thats so said dobbs but now
hell go on the prod hc-s just the kind
to lay for us and shoot us

  not him said bill hell figger
were watchin for him and as theres
two of us hell beat it for the outside

  the next two days brought no sign
of flint and when a week pad un-
eventfully they began to relax their
watchfulness

  whatd i tell you said bill the
od wolveriue was tryin to run a blazer
on us all he needed was to be showed
we meant business and he cant make
no trouble for us when he gets out
cause our two words are bettern his

  and so they went about their business
once more in comfortable security quite
untroubled by thought of the lone refu-
gee toiling through the deep snows to-
ward the abodes of men as they looked
at it he was lucky to have the chance
which had been vouchsafed him for
they knew those who would not have
given it at all their consciences were
quite easy and they enjoyed once more
the feeling of sole ownership

  only we got to rip the heart out of
her this season dobbs pointed out as
they sat one night before the fire
 cause if flint makes the riffle even
though he dont raise no war yell on us
next year he gets him a partner and it
we want to trap in here we got to do
it in the smoke and i aint that fond
of trappin

  nor me bill admitted it aint
our business well just take what we
can get and quit we ought to have
enough right now to pay mcnicol and
live for a year with some fun throwed
in

  well get more and better fur after
thanksgiving said dobbs suddenly
an idea seemed to strike him he got
up stirred the fire and inspected a line
of cryptic marks upon the wall say 
he said do you know what day this
is

  wednesday or sunday or sm other
day bill replied indifferently

  twenty-fourth of november said
dobbs
a thousand a plate



well what about it
thanksgiving eve dobbs told him
and what about that bill asked
you aint figgerin on nuts and turkey
are you cause im afraid youll be
disappointed

  dobbs licked his old lips sinfully and
his jaws waggled like those of a cat
which sees a bird almost within spring-
ing distance

  thanksgiving eve he repeated
we was to have a leetle celebration
thanksgiving eve and he added
somewhat anxiously you aint forgot
about that bill its an awful long
time since we had a drink

  last time you had too many
skookum bill reminded him

  what if i had dobbs asked in in-
jured tones i get dura little fun in
life and im gettin old about the
only time i feel good and like i used to
is when im tanked up wait twenty
years and youll know

  oh all right said his partner
somewhat apprehensively for he had
the horror of the young and absolutely
healthy for the dismal forebodings and
outlook of age i dunno but i feel
like a drink or two myself and as
you say we was goin to celebrate a
little only well go light on the stuff
cause as i told you before we want to
have a little left in case of sickness
dobbs agreed hypocritically for
weeks his whole being had craved
liquor once he had furtively helped
himself to a drink and had shaken in
his shoes lest his partners nostrils
should detect the strong-odored rum
in which event he would have had a
severe manhandling for skookum bill
brooked no infraction of the camp rules
which he laid down

  but as it happened that night bill
was in a more or less free and unbelted
mood also but in a lesser degree than
his partner he craved alcohol not so
much physically for his nerves were
as yet quite untouched but mentally

as a change from the monotony of their
existence

  now the rum as has been said was
criminally overproof and they had had
no intoxicants for a long time and
so a couple of stiff drinks produced a
beautiful and generous expansion of
soul the mean cabin became larger
the fire warmer and more cheerful and
life generally of a more roseate hue
they began to feel the prodigal thanks-
giving spirit and to regret their limited
opportunities for satisfying it

  i wisht we was somewheres said
bill look at all them skins and think
of what theyd buy and what good
are they to us here rising he
searched out the pelt of the black fox
held it up and stroked the glossy coat
lovingly whats this black dog worth
sam

  whatever you can get dobbs re-
plied bitterly we never get nothing
like what theyre worth but this here
is a beauty i dont spose theres a
better pelt in the world or ever has
been mcnicol will get near twenty-
five hundred if he holds out and we
ort to hold out for two thousand

  you bet we will bill affirmed if
i had my share of that to-night down
in vancouver or seattle thingsd move
some

  they sure would dobbs agreed i
remember once i hit seattle with a little

stake and- he embarked on a

lurid narrative of his deeds on that
historic occasion

  bill piled wood on the fire with a
prodigal hand and took up the tale
later he essayed song roaring forth
unprintable ballads in a tremendous
harsh bass which drowned his partners
sadly cracked tenor by this time his
determination to go light on the rum
was quite forgotten and dobbs who
had never in all his long and sinful life
denied himself anything which was
ready to his hand was not the man to
remind him even if he dobbs had not
western story magazine

reached a composite condition which
may be describe as the sentimental-
philosophical-religious-despondent in
which a corresponding variety of men-
tal kinks became evident

   s funny world he announced sol-
emnly when you size her up some
folks alius has the best of it v accord-
inly others gets the worst s logic
and you cant beat it me i alius got
the worst s the scripture says i ask
for bread and i get the laugh like the
prodigal son

  you dont know your own luck
said bill what you kickin at here
y u got a fire and blankets and booze
and eats youre blame lucky if you
ask me howd you like to be mushin
along in the snow campin under a tree
somewheres like that durn old wolver-
ine flint

  proves what i was savin dobbs
argued he gets the worst of it i
aint sure we done right about that
bill the tender mercies of the wicked
are cruel an were wicked-were
good v wicked if it was to do over
again id say shoot him tenderly itd
be safer

  he cant do nothin bill asserted
something might happen to him and
hed die-in the snow said dobbs tear-
fully s v awful death bill im
fraid of it an hes old like me he
wont never make it hell freeze n

die	shockin but then he wont
never tell nobodv how he was burnt out
nor get a chance to play even  us
so its all for th best an we shouldnt
doubt n inscrutable providence but
 n awful thing to kill a fellow bein
bill

  not when he needs it bill said
grimly

  i killed a fellow bein once-with an
ax his partner whimpered he
needed it too he knifed me an i
near died promise you wont let me
die in the snow bill

  thereafter he became unintelligibly

maudlin and staggered to his bunk
skookum bill sat alone his head sing-
ing with raw rum the prey of a thou-
sand devils of desire which he could
not satisfy the happy stage had
passed he was morose sour of tem-
per as an old bull in any companion-
ship he would have picked a quarrel
fought and thus worked off his ill tem-
per but as there was no one to tight
with he merely drank and scowled be-
ing cold he threw more wood on the
fire recklessly as it blazed the heal
working on the alcohol made him sleepy
he blinked drunkenly at his bunk but
lacked the energy to rise to get to it
instead he leaned forward and laid
his head on his folded arms which
rested on the table beside the skin of
the black fox in a moment he was
asleep

  how long he slept thus he never
knew he awoke gasping choking in
an atmosphere which bit bis throat and
lungs and stung his eyes in his ear
was an ominous crackling and snapping
and a glare met his sight from which
he shrank like a frightened animal for
a moment his sodden senses refused to
comprehend but instinctively he sprang
for the door

  with its opening and the admission
of fresh air the interior of the cabin
leaped into flame red tongues ran up
the heat-dried resinous walls and roof
smoke billowed out at him through the
door

  the break into the air of the winters
night was like a plunge into ice water
he sobered suddenly he  was not
overly intelligent but all his life he had
been accustomed to dangers to emer-
gencies which must he met bv instant
bodily action and so he did not hesi-
tate drawing his great lungs full of
pure air he plunged back into the
smoke dragged his stupefied partner
from his bunk and flung him out in the
snow

  thereafter his actions were of the
a thousand a plate



whirlwind variety he made no useless
attempt to fight the fire w hatever he
could lay hands on in the choking smoke
he flung through the door and finally
emerged with racked lungs blinded
eyes and scorched hair and flesh gasp-
ing and cursing he watched the flames
burst through the roof and roar wind-
driven in a mighty licking tongue
which seemed to reach out toward him
hungrily

  but in a moment the frost nipped at
him immediately he pounced upon his
prostrate partner and shook him vio-
lently

  lemme lone dobbs muttered
and bill cuffed him with the earnest-
ness of a she-bear admonishing a cub

  wake up you old stiff he shouted
or youll wake up somewhere thats not
heaven and dobbs catching the
concluding words opened uncompre-
hending and dazed eyes upon a red glare
and smoke which eddied around him
and soaring sparks

  not in heaven he croaked jus
s ive alius expected an bills along
too n i aint sprised at that

  you aint hey growled his part-
ner and shook him again so that his
old head snapped to and fro perilously
lemme tell you any place is tame to
this were burnt out-burnt out dye
hear and if you dont wake up and
get your blood to movin youll freeze
so solid youll never thaw and he
smote him again

  burnt out dobbs repeated stu-
pidly burnt out

  you got it snapped skookum bill
and hauled him to his feet get some
more clothes on you i dont know
what i pitched out yet i hadnt no
time to be particlar

  luckily they had been fully clad even
to their moccasins and bill had rescued
their heavy ourer garments which had
hung near the door dobbs got into
his coat shivering with cold

  howd she start he queried

  i dunno his partner replied sul-
lenly hot coal i spose or chimbley

t had on a big fire when i dropped

asleep

  this is what we get for burnin flint
out whined dobbs you shouldnt
have did that bill its a judgment
aw shut up growled his partner
you make me sick judgment my
neck there aint no such thing
yes there is dobbs insisted
this proves it

  cut it out roared skookum bill
in sudden fury another word out of
you and ill throw you on that fire
dobbs cowed and shaken wisely re-
frained from further observations
they passed the remainder of the night
miserably and with daylight they took
stock of their belongings

  these were few there was a rifle
with but three shells in the magazine
and these constituted their entire stock
of ammunition there were two blan-
kets stripped from the bunks part of a
sack of flour and a box of matches
their snowshoes and ax and a light to-
boggan had been outside and so were
uninjured unfortunately they were
low in venison part of a quarter only
remaining and last but of little im-
mediate value was the skin of the black
fox which had been lying on the table
all the other pelts were gone it was a
very scanty outfit indeed and they re-
garded it gloomily

  theres only one thing to do skoo-
kum bill observed and thats to beat
it for the outside sooner we start the
better

  aint there no grub in the line

camp

  not a smell this is the outfit right
here and it aint much

  youre right it aint said dobbs
i was savin i didnt believe i could
make the outside and now ill have a
chance to see

  sure youll make it said bill who
knew the importance of a stout heart


western story magazine

on a long hard trail well travel
along easy and make good camps
we aint got enough grub to lake
it easy dobbs pointed out and just
when you need meat is the time you
dont see it

  which was so true that skookum bill
went to loading the toboggan without
reply this done he adjusted the loops
of his snowshoes and dropped the line
of the sled over his shoulders

  all set he asked

  gimme a rope of the toboggan

  i will when i get tired said bill

iii

  day after day they plodded steadily
in a white wilderness by day the
hard exercise kept them warm but
camping in the snow under even the
most favorable conditions is not fun
and when one is short of food and blan-
kets it is miserable in spite of all they
could do in the way of shelters and no
matter how cunningly they arranged
their reflecting backlogs and fires they
shivered from dark to dawn thus they
had little real rest the very exercise
which kept them warm by day burned
up the food which they ate and de-
manded more not getting it it con-
sumed the body tissues they grew
gaunt and haggard and sunken of eye
but there could be no rest

  as dobbs had feared they found no
red meat at any other time they
would have chanced on deer or moose
but now in their necessity they saw
neither it seemed an off year for
rabbits they caught two in snares and
had the luck to kill three grouse with
sticks for they were reluctant to waste
their precious cartridges on such small
game these eked out the small supply
of venison and flour but the time came
when they were forced to cut down
their scanty daily rations

  its a case said bill its twelve
days givin ourselves the best of it to
the portage and it looks like there was

a hoodoo on us for meat we got to
cut right down

  and then a piece of the worst pos-
sible luck befell dobbs descending a
steep place caught the toe of his snow-
shoe in brush tripped and fell twenty
feet bringing up among rocks sticking
out of the snow when he tried to rise
he sank back stifling a groan

  you aint hurt yourself cried bill
leg said dobbs briefly she got
a bad crack and a twist i-i cant
walk on her bill

  well camp and have a look at her
said bill quietly a little rest will do
us good

  he made a fire and stripping his
partners leg examined it it was al-
ready swollen and discoloring and just
above the ankle it was painful to the
touch

  looks to me like the little bones
bust said bill referring to the fibula
you sure cant walk on her he was
silent for a moment the devil he
added justifiably

  into dobbs old eyes came the expres-
sion of a stricken animal but he said
nothing waiting bill scowled at the
fire

  hard luck but it cant be helped
he said at length ill fix it up the
best i can with splints we wont go
no farther to-dav

  if its broke i wont be able to walk
to-morrow dobbs ventured

  you wont be able to walk for
weeks his partner told him ill haul
you on the toboggan

  you cant-not in this soft snow
said dobbs its white of you bill
but its too much

  i never quit a partner yet the big
man announced i aint no smear heel
i can do it all right im skookum
and i aint never struck my limit yet
he stretched his great body with a sud-
den rippling heave of muscle and sinew
dont you worry bout me old-timer
well pull through somehow
a thousand a plate



  he cut a thick bough bed and splints
from a straight-grained sapling with
which he bound his partners leg but
not too tightly lest the impeded circu-
lation should cause the foot to freeze
and in the morning he made him as
comfortable as possible on the tobog-
gan looped the line over his shoulders
and started

  though dobbs was lean his weight
in that soft snow made a heavy load
bill was forced to pick his way care-
fully now and then on crust the going
was good and he made better time
but on the whole progress was alarm-
ingly slow even on downward slopes
it was a pull up them it was a strain
the exertion wrung the sweat from his
hard body now and then he was
forced to rest

  im too durn heavy said dobbs
sadly

  no you aint his partner replied
youre lighter than i thought wait
till we get down along the river where
the snow is packed and well just burn
up the trail

  magnificent lying and dobbs knew
it he could tell by the sinking of his
partners webs in the snow by his heavy
breathing by the heave of his chest and
the running sweat when he halted a
good judge of distance and pace he
knew that the miles of a days march
were being cut in less than half which
meant that instead of being twelve days
from the portage they were in fact
more than twenty-four and even on
rations reduced to the starvation point
they had enough food only for six

  over these things dobbs brooded sit-
ting helpless on the toboggan watching
the pistonlike tireless driving stride of
the magnificent human mectianism in
front of him and one night he looked
at his scanty meal with a tolerable im-
itation of repulsion

  i dont want no supper said he

  you aint feelin sick asked bill
apprehensively

 d-w

  no not sick dobbs assured him
i just aint hungry i guess my stum-
micks sorter turned against this grub
itll do me good to go without a meal
or two which was uttered with the
best intentions but was a distinct over-
play of his hand

  you old liar said bill im onto
you biggern a house you eat that
grub

  and dobbs finding his scheme de-
tected gave up the pretense

  i wont he said youre doin
all the work while im just settin still
you need the grub and i dont i dont
have to keep strong and you do
youve got to have it to pull me be-
sides he added with a brave attempt
at humor the less i eat the lighter ill
get and thatll help some

  and thatll be all from you said
bill think im goin to see a partner
with a busted leg starve bimself not
much eat it or ill ram it down von
and so dobbs ate unwillingly while
his partner predicted a change of luck
which should give them meat sooner
or later he maintained they were bound
to find deer

  but the only change was one of
weather which had been fine though
cold now a blizzard descended on
them driven by a wind from the arctic
wastes which cut the skin like a knife
skookum bill battled with it for two
hours before he gave up with frost
spots on his face and his lungs aching
from the rhirty-below air that he had
pumped into them which was yet insuf-
ficient for his exertions

  they camped in the thickest spruce
they could find and the blizzard raged
two days which reduced their stock of
food to the vanishing point also it
made new fresh snow and harder go-
ing than ever

but anyhow said bill weve had
a good rest now watch me hit her
and he did hit her tearing along
in a knee-high flurry of snow while
os

western story magazine

dobbs watched him with hollow-eyed
bitter longing and self-reproach the
next day the grub gave out

  bill said the older man its no
use you cant get me to the portage
and youll have an awful job gettin
there alone still you got a chance
right here we split the blankets

  guess again said bill

  i dont need to said dobbs ive
seen this cornin from the first and
now its here when luck sets against
you you cant change it you cant
make the portage with me youve
done more than any two men could do
already there aint no sense in both
of us dyin and im elected im an
old dog and my times mighty nigh up
anyhow so it dont matter so much

  i said wed make the portage said
bill with an oath and well make it
together or not at all i wouldnt quit
a partner while hes alive i said i
hadnt hit my limit and i aint hit her
yet when i do ill tell you and
nothing that dobbs could say shook his
resolution

  but dobbs was not deceived he
knew that his partners strength was
rapidly running out-that even his
splendid muscles and wonderful endur-
ance could not stand up much longer
against the double strain of exertion
and hunger now dobbs was an old
reprobate hardened in wickedness
without noticeable conscience or prin-
ciple but nevertheless he had one soft
spot in his heart and that was for his
partner also he had his peculiar ideas
of honor and finding argument unavail-
ing he decided that it was up to him

  and so very gently he lifted the
rifle which lay on the toboggan beside
him levered a cartridge into the cham-
ber with great care lest the crank of
the magazine action should betray him
reversed the weapon rested his fore-
head upon the muzzle shut his eyes
and slid his hand down the barrel for
the trigger

  but at that moment skookum bill
chanced to look over his shoulder he
leaped backward caught the groping
hand and snatched the weapon away

  no you dont he roared think
ive packed you all this way to have
you blow the top of your head off now 
you ought to be ashamed of yourself
dobbs after a futile attempt to re-
gain the rifle sank back shaking for
at that moment he had fully intended
and expected to be dead

   couldnt see no other way he
whimpered his nerve suddenly desert-
ing him you said yourself you
wouldnt leave me while we was both
alive i wanted to give you a show
bill what did you stop me for i
was all keyed up to it and now  dun-
nos i can

  i know durn well you wont get the
chance said skookum bill levering
the shells from the magazine and put-
ting them in his pocket so that was
why you blame old stiff but his
tone held a certain admiration and af-
fection dont try no such play again
for ill pack you along livin or dead
and so it wont do you no good til
copper it from the start

  dobbs knew that he would do ex-
actly as he had said

  i wont he promised but it means
that well both die

  not a die said bill doggedly
well pull through i tell you lucks
goin to change i can feel it cornin
but for days they had been on star-
vation rations thus bill in particular
had almost exhausted his reserve of
strength and vitality now when food
was cut off altogether he weakened
rapidly the first day he held to the
work but he did so on his nerve alone
on the second day in the afternoon
by a small frozen stream he stopped

  ive hit my limit at last he said
reluctantly there aint another mile
in me without grub or rest-but mostly
grub id eat my moccasins only my
a thousand a plate



feet would freeze and id die any-
how

  take mine said dobbs eagerly
take mine and go ahead alone it
wont make no difference to me bill
i wont bill refused i said wed
make the riffle together or not at all if
we only had something to hold us over
till we could find meat any old chunk
of hide would do suddenly he
started why didnt i think of it be-
fore but maybe its just as well i
didnt we got the skin of that black
fox well eat that

  eat it dobbs exclaimed but
bill its worth from a thousand up
not here it aint said skookum
bill stating a fundamental economic
principle here it aint worth a tink-
ers curse nothing is that aint grub
well stew her up right here you take
a knife and sorter shave the fur off
while im rustlin wood

  and so while he sought dry wood
and split it and got water old dobbs
cut away the priceless fur with the keen
small blade of his knife and finally
held up a scraped parchmentlike hide-
ous hide in place of the glossy black
robe which had all gone well would
have adorned the beauty of some
woman who had never known hunger
or cold or privation in any form old
dobbs starving as he was almost wept
at the sacrilege

  cut her into strips said skookum
bill practically shell stew better
and be easier to chew on

  they boiled it for an hour and then
their hunger driving them ate worry-
ing it down to the last morsel it was
tough and springy and tasted like car-
rion but it was food and their stom-
achs rejoiced thereat at any rate the
evil hour was set back and that was
something

  if we ever get out o this said
bill we can blow that weve et a meal
that cost us a thousand a plate and
thats some high-priced muckamuck i

wonder what old mcnicol would say
if he knew

  he wont never know said dobbs
despondently because we wont never

  he broke off for his partner had
bounded to his feet and dived for the
rifle dobbs turned behind him at a
distance of perhaps two hundred yards
ran a buck laboring in the snow evi-
dently the animal had come upon them
unaware for it had turned off at a sharp
angle

  shoot yelled old dobbs rashly be-
side himself at the sight of meat
shoot bill shoot quick hes get-
tin away

  whereby dobbs violated both eti-
quette and common sense for quick
accurate shooting demands both confi-
dence and concentration and his fran-
tic yell was destructive of both under
ordinary circumstances skookum bill
would have paid little attention but
he was exhausted his nerves worn raw
and he was practically starving and
so he behaved like a novice instead of
the veteran that he was

  barely waiting to catch his sights he
fired and the bullet threw up a spray
of snow ahead and to the left in-
stantly he pumped another shell and
fired again and again he missed with
his last cartridge he drew a fine sight
dwelt on his trigger and consequently
shot behind from force of habit he
pumped again but the hammer clicked
down on an empty chamber

  oh lord groaned dobbs you
missed him bill hes got away
his partner whirled the useless rifle
above his head and flung it far in the
snow he turned on him his face
black with rage

  you made me miss he roared in
fury you yelled in my ear when i
was aimin dont you know nothin
aint you got no sense at all i been
haulin you days and days pumpin the
heart out of me to save your worthless


western story magazine

old life and heres what i get for it
all you had to do was to keep your fool
mouth shut-and you wouldnt you

- the remainder of his speech

was fervid blasphemy which seemed to
crackle about dobbs miserable ears

  the latter made no attempt to reply
or to palliate his offense under the
torrent of bitter words his lips began
to quiver suddenly he buried his face
in his hands and sobbed and the sound
shocked skookum bill into sanity he
eyed the pitiful old broken figure for
a moment and the blaze of fury died
from his eyes

  quit it for goodness sake and be
a man he said and dobbs raised a
face contorted with abject misery

   i cant be because i aint he whim-
pered i aint a man no more im
just a poor broken-legged old dog
starved and froze and kicked and
cussed an im goin to die an be
finished an it serves me right take
n hit me on the head with the ax an
then you wont be bothered with me
no more

  his misery was so abject and his
nerve so plainly broken that skookum
bill repented of his hasty words

  brace up sam he said t sorter
flew off the handle but you know how
i am i dont mean all i say

  you meant it and it was cornin to
me dobbs mumbled sadly it dont
matter bill youd orter let me use one
of them catridges on myself when i
wanted to

  bill being somewhat of the same
opinion said nothing for the first time
he lost hope now it would avail them
nothing to find deer and without the
chance of procuring meat vanished also
the faint chance of making the portage
even alone the grisly vision of death
in that frozen wilderness which had
stood half curtained in the back of his
mind for days now stalked boldly into
the foreground

  a long silence fell they sat by the

remnants of the fire looking at the trod-
den snow sprinkled with shreds of the
fur of the black fox heedless of the
waning afternoon and the increasing
cold

  suddenly from upwind from the di-
rection in which the buck had vanished
there came a sound and the heads of
both men jerked upright as if actuated
by one string sharply pulled as their
eves met in unspoken query the sound
was repeated this time it was unmis-
takable crisp and clear though far
away-the smacking report of a rifle

  a gun two shots dobbs

breathed who dyou spose-

  but skookum bill was shoving his
feet into the loops of his snowshoes
hurriedly

   ill find him he said ill bet hes
got that buck keep die fire goin
he took the bucks trail at a run for
the prospect of aid in their dire need
lent him energy the trail led straight
upwind for a mile or more he fol-
lowed it and suddenly came to its end

   before him in an open space lay the
bucks body and above it knife in
hand a man was skinning busily

   bill hailed a hoarse joyous shout
for here was both meat and human as-
sistance and ran toward him but the
stranger picked up a rifle from the
snowr and skookum bill as he faced
him recognized the forbidding features
of jake flint

  dont come no nearer flint
warned his finger on the trigger i
been lookin for you for some time he

added	 

   im here said bill and as i am t
got no gun you can calm down your
nerves

   flint eyed his wasted features for a
moment curiously

  you fellers he stated coldly
burned down my cabin what have
you got to say about it

   that was a mistake said bill
a thousand a plate



  youll find it was flint returned
grimly

sure said bill the way its
turned out i ought to have shot you
you got a cold nerve flint com-
mented not without approval i spose
you savvy im goin to shoot you

  of course bill admitted i fig-
gered you would if you got the chance
i can take my medicine only sam my
partner he hadnt nothin to do with it
he didnt hey  said flint skepti-
cally

  not a thing bill asserted it
was me and you know durn well there
was only one set of tracks

  i know that flint returned and
theres only one set of tracks on this
trail of yourn that ive been follerin
but theres been two men in camp
im packin sam on the toboggan be-
cause his legs busted bill explained
its a hard deal on him to be shot for
what i done but of course hes durn
near starved to death anyway

  you dont look as if bein burned
out agreed with you either said flint

  never mind that growled skookum
bill heres the proposition sam
aint done nothin to be shot for and
he cant walk you shoot me and
there aint no one to haul him without
you do and you cn believe me when
i say that pullin a man in this snow
aint no cinch now if you was to
give us a hunk of that meat we could
make the portage and any shootin you
wanted to do could come off after-
ward

  think youd beat me to it hey
asked flint

  naw said bill with some con-
tempt cant you get it through your
head that im tryin to make a deal
with you

  you mean youd let me shoot you
afterward said flint incredulously
do you think id believe that

  all right said bill then you dont
have to ive put up my talk youll

find sam along my back trail he aint
got no gun nor nothin and now you
can get this shootin over any time
youre a mind to

  flint and he looked each other in
the eye the former raised his rifle
slowly

  skookum bill stared above the black
ring down the line of the sights

  why dont you shoot he de-
manded tryin to raise a yellow
streak in me well youre wastin
time for i aint got one

  and flint with an oath of reluctant
admiration lowered his rifle

  i ought to but i cant he admitted
if youd weakened i would and any
time i cant play a thing the limit i
dont play it at all im willing to call
this off-if vou are

  am i said bill what do you
think shake on it

  they shook each knowing the other
for a hard man and respecting him ac-
cordingly

  i can say now said bill that im
durn sorry i burnt your shack

  of course i should have moved my
traps from east of that crick flint ad-
mitted but you come at me so bull-
headed smashin them and warnin me
off that it sorter put up my back hair
when i found the shack burnt i struck
back a ways and built me a new one i
had some grub cached and i was goin
to get even thats how i didnt know
you was burnt out for some days soon
as i found out i loaded up and hit your
trail i sure intended to get both of
you now im glad i didnt we can
trap that valley next winter theres
room for all of us and we can do it
friendly like we should

  we could-but we wont skookum
bill told him well make you a pres-
ent of that valley me and sam wont
trap no more it aint our business

in his store at ihe portage stared at
two scarecrows who entered to him at
first scarcely recognizing them one
living skeleton hobbled with the aid of
a homemade crutch and the other was
merely a giant rack of hones the
black finger marks of the frost were on
their faces and their bearded cheeks
were sunken pasted in flatly against the
teeth so that the cheek bones almost
protruded through he stretched skin

  save us mcnicol exclaimed so
its you

  tts us skookum bill replied and
with his customary directness he added
and we want another grubstake

  ye look as if ye did mcnicol com-
mented sourly recovering his accus-
tomed poise and manner of speech i
thought he continued ye were goin
to a district that was fair crawlin wi
fur from which there was no cornin
out in the winter

  we was burnt out and we had to
come bill told him we had the
furs too but they was all burnt except
one we saved that

  very provident of ye mcnicol
commented sardonically and that
onell no doubt be a muskrat in the
nature of things ved no save anything
that would help pay what ye owe
it wasnt no muskrat said bill it
was a black fox

  a black fox monicol exclaimed
ye have the skin of a black fox
not now bill admitted sadly
what have ye done with it the
trader demanded

  we et it bill replied calmlv

  e-what mcnicol almost
shrieked

  et it bill repeated we was sor-
ter hungry at the time

  we was starvin  said dobbs

  and so we aint got no furs nor
money nor nothin bill pursued down-
rightly but all the same we got to
have grub and things well pay up in
the spring soon as we can wash some
dirt we know of

  mcnicol shook his head

   the way of the transgressor is
hard  said he also all men are
liars-at times yell admit the rele-
vancy of the quotations which yell
scarce recognize bein from the scrip-
tures prove to me that ye ate the skin
of a black fox and ill grubstake ye
afresh but not unless

  skookum bill walked over to the floor
scales and stepped upon the platform

  you saw me weigh myself when i
was in here last he said two hun-
dred and seventeen i weighed well
look here

  the two-hundred-pound weight was
on the drop removing it he substi-
tuted the one hundred back and back
he slid the balance weight on the beam
even his face expressed surprise the

  the scales balanced at one hundrea

p ulminakng a long series of crimes a robbery and murder are committed in a small town in
colorado the clews to the outlaws are lost in the vicinity of yuga lake clarence burden
a wealthy young lawyer is camping ai the lake with two ex-cow-punchers carter tlnpsley and
frank egbert whom burden met at his uncles ranch and for whom he has formed a strong attach-
ment  with them is mike gorgon a servant of the burden family and louis forches fellow in
geology and zoology with sheriff hanford and a posse the party surrounds an old dwelling on a
deserted ranch labeled dump  thought to be the headquarters of the outlaws but an attack
proves fruitless later the old ranch house is found to be the entrance to a vast underground
cave

     the party sets out to explore the cave and an accidental tire cuts off their avenue of escape
they find half of a map showing the hiding place of a treasure described by one of the out-
laws whom burden befriended after days of wandering in the underground chamber sam small
leader of the outlaws who is hunting for the gold joins them and turns over the other half of
the treasure map all are cast adrift in a stream in forches boat and are pitched over a waterfall
they are reunited unhurt below the falls and by means of the map they find a number of chests
of gold and antique coins 

    they are taken captive by a band of strange-looking white-haired men descendants of the
first basque explorers of the cave and are brought for trial before their queen yuana archu
through the influence of alzkibel whose attempt to assassinate the queen is thwarted by egbert
they are condemned to death egbert deties them in the confusion which follows small disap-
pears and tingsley recognizing the language of the people addresses the queen

the tone was so full oi sweet sincerity
none could resist it egbert stepped
from our rank and like a courtier of
oldt dropped on one knee before her

   my-our lives are yulirs whatever
said he

   he arose at her behest for a long
moment each looked upon the other in
silence there was that in the queens
eyes which made us envy him

   then upon a whistle hung about her
neck by a gold chain the queen blew
three sharp blasts at once without
there arose outcries and a scuffling and
guards some thirty strong burst
through the doorway they looked a
better lot than those of aizkibel and
among them were the men who first

               queen after a mo-
             nt drew herself up
             ively and acknowledged
             r salute

               you are my friends
d she speaking in
french which though not modern was
so pure that even i could follow it-
but addressing egbert in particular
of whence you come there is no time
to talk aizkibel is my enemy i had
hoped to stave my people from war with
him and his followers but to-day he
has overstepped intrigue and war is
here i accept your aid

the voice was low determined and

had brought us from above some
were much cut and bruised as though
they had been fighting

  yuana raised her arm as they halted
before her the time has come said
she we may fight long and no one
knows rhe outcome but still these
strangers stand with us which augurs
well are your thoughts still the same
to live and die for me

  as in one voice came crashing the
responses out ma reine and
though here and there in the line a
look of awed astonishment flickered to-
ward the now vacant recess in the wall
of rock they stood stanch without
wavering

  then egbert as though it were or-
dered took the lead while tingsley
acted as interpreter guard all the
doors he ordered stand ready in
threes to defend each one until the
next command

  yuana nodded echoing his words in
the basque language and the guards
obeyed without delay that she was
loved by her loyal subjects there was
no doubt it was something of a trial
thus at once to fall beneath the lead
of such a startling stranger but disci-
pline prevailed the queens will was
their own and was respected

  the way in which yuana thrust her-
self in egberts hands at first was sur-
prising but later i found the cause
it was necessity she was to every
purpose but a prisoner within her gates
the victim of intriguing aizkibel who
planned her downfall success for us
was hers

  porches grew busy with the weapons
in the boat the cartridges now left
were few and these he sorted equally
among us

  the queen stepped down to a table
and with a sharp pointed stone
scratched a sketch upon its surface
ihus lie the ways said she this is
the palace and first it must be cleared
the outline was simple the palace

though extended held but fifteen

rooms whose doors faced a main hall
which though it turned was for the
most in front from this great gates
close to its center opened out and a
small door by which we had ap-
proached was at one end beyond the
latter lay the gardens which comprised
all that large space reaching from the
falls to where the river narrowed and
at last ran under a low arch closing
the passage but for where it ran except
for a small entering path the ar-
rangement could not have been better
adapted for defense

   egbert took gordon and six guards
to clear the palace on the garden side
while forches i and others were de-
tailed to take the opposite path anil
driving out the foe within the edifice
to hold the gates tingsley w-ith those
who were left was to remain behind
to guard the queen

   as we prepared to sally the old
judge who had stood by the queen
looked on absorbed and pleased his
horny hands and long white beard
shook with excitement as he gave us
counsel and advice they will be to
you as three to one oh men of the
bright land said he but if they
give before you and the magic of your
weapons victory will be ours for we
can hold the place the people are at
heart well with the queen would i
were young enough to help j willingly
would lose my life to save the house of
archu good fortune to you 

  yuana archu turned toward us
ganis arteche speaks truth she
proudly said he is my minister and
friend as was he my fathers friend
before me heed his counsel for it is
that of fourscore years and ten cet
fear not the cowards will not stand
before your guns the cause is ours
so shall the help of providence mid
prayers of your queen be with you

   i remember even in all that excite-
ment my deep surprise at hearing that
into the unknown



word guns used so familiarly
where had she picked it up i found
out later

  now as she finished egberts force
marched out gordon well toward the
front still calling on the saints and
crossing himself he had at first re-
fused to leave me consenting only at
my firm command it turned out well
that he was with egbert and not with
me as he moved off he called
well misther clarence if yez be in
throuble lioot only wance ond moikell
join yez	

  though now we had been given some
idea of how things lay we still were
partly in  maze the strength of our
strange enemy we guessed of how
they fought and of that beyond the
palace we knew nothing and since
we could not speak their tongue
forches and i were in compulsion
bound to trust ourselves to our small
force these noble fellows never
paused but rushed ahead determinedly
occasionally was heard the clashing of
the long bone-handled spears as we
came on some foe and there would be
a combat to the death

  some of our men were wounded
though we always won and carried all
before us until we approached the gates
here we came upon a force so strong
that it seemed we must be overwhelmed
if only by numbers and seeing reen-
forcements from without adding to the
strength against us we knew that we
must act our little group while bat-
tling heroically was giving ground
forced by the charging body which an
ugly stooping giant now urged for-
ward

  then forches shot for the first time
before the fighting had all been with
spears it was enough the leader fell
stretched dead before his men and
they not knowing what strange power
of death we held all fled in panic
while we followed

  we readied the entrance facing on

the side of a long passage like a street
across which sundry pillars holes and
byways lay among these a myriad
heads dodged back and forth or paus-
ing stared in open-mouthed astonish-
ment while bobbing torches spread
vague bluish light it was soon evi-
dent that these spectators must have
an object lesson and before the enemy
had disappeared i shot too into their
ranks as they fled to the left

  they saw the weapon flashing heard
its crack and as a mail fell dead as if
by magic the heads shot back like
those of frightened woodchucks to
their holes the place was cleared
we held the palace gates

  by signs and much bad french we
managed to convey an order to the
wondering guards to hold the place
telling them that we would now report
back to the queen and that at the least
untoward incident they must ap-
prise us

  yuana and good old arteche wel-
comed us great was their joy and
trebly great when egbert next came
running in victorious his territory
was more difficult than ours to cover
there had been more strenuous fighting
j-iis cartridges were gone and a slight
cut above the temple showed that he
had had it hand to hand for once at
least

  your majesty the way is dear he
announced yuana understood him

  i gleaned the rest from gordon who
trailed in later sure misther clar-
ence said he misther frank he a-r-r

limes goes limnin like scared rabbits
down the side of the creek

  did you happen to see small  i

grown suspicious of his good intentions

  thot snake replied gordon
faith thin i did i sane him at the
ind a-crawlin down the creek frm
where he hod been hidin hes wid

  if he has tried to mix with that
bunch i returned he likely before
now has gotten his deserts if not
hell turn up later

  but gordon with a shrug said a
slick pace thot raon ond if he gets
wid thim im froightful av phwhat
comes

  the queen addressing egbert
flushed all pink in utter happiness
most noble friend said she i owe
thee all the highest honors at my
court are thine henceforth shalt thou
be stranger nevermore but counselor
in place of aizkibel thou shalt be
fourth high judge

  egbert who understood but part of
what was said saluted while i who
thought i saw a way to safety clinched
the thing and quickly whispering to
tingsley bade him speak with eg-
bert on the bench i fek quite sure no
harm could come to us

  and tingsley smiling said in
french your gracious majesty that
sudi an honor falls to our friend who
worthily will fill it pleases us but
douiblv are we pleased to tell you he
will serve

  yuana inclined her head in accept-
ance of our thanks but egbert smil-
ing in uncertainty and puzzled turned
toward us he did not know what had
been offered him and hence did not re-
fuse and we said nothing more about
the matter at the time

  a hundred questions stood upon our
tongues about the court and people
and especially about that awesome being
who had gone but so fast did inci-
dent lap over incident there was no
chance

  the old judge no less happy than
the queen now turned to her thou
next must show thyself said he be-
fore the people for in six months they
have not seen thy face and know not
that thou reignest the rumor that
thou dost not live is all that has allowed
the evolutions pace they love thee
as they have all archus through all
time without delay come to the gate-
way showing them that the fight we
make is for the queen alone

  we reached the gates where the
guards still stood faithful outside
the loyalists were growing bolder the
men came near and stared while pale
young women children hanging at
their heels came nearer

  gan is arteche now put a strange
stone instrument to his lips and blew
three feeble blasts yuana at his side
her graceful figure illumined by the
light from bobbing torches stood much
in contrast to the crowd around her
face was radiant her figure straight
and she alone of all that multitude had
some small coloring about her features
had she lived on the surface her de-
lightful gray-white hair might have
been black as jet as it was here its
strange vitality bespoke the life of
youth it fell in waves on half-bared
perfect shoulders as she waited

  i cannot tell just what occurred but
when the crowd grew dense arteche
spoke and then the queen using their
own basque language from the peo-
ples temper it was evident they were
well pleased score upon score passed
by bowed- low and cheered and the
women with small babies and queer-
looking children filed forward to kix
yuanas hands while the old judge and
guards were all alert for treachery
into the unknown



  at length it ended and we now re-
turned the guards augmented by a
force from those without as loyal evi-
dently as they were themselves

  arteche turned to tingsley tell
your friends said he that all is clear
the situation safe you shall of
course be guests within the palace

chapter xxii

church bells

coon afterward we were placed in
 charge of a waiting woman who
led us to the dining hall alone and
others came and spread a steaming
feast before us composed of fish and
of a vegetable most startlingly familiar

  forches examined this last carefully
its corn he said at length and still
bent on unraveling mysteries went on
if im not mistaken this explains all
that odd basketwork that we have seen
now that i think of it some of that
substance much resembled corn leaves
doubtless these people driven by their
necessities have discovered ways of
treating leaves and husks and even
stems in the centuries they have lived
underground by toughening and
strengthening the parts in some man-
ner they have woven cloth and cloth-
ing from the shreds while from the
coarser parts their baskets doors and
bridges and what not have been con-
structed

  but the corn i asked where do
they get it

  without a doubt forches replied
that group of basques originally
made captives in the cave had kernels
with them if but in small quantity the
corn was planted and has multiplied
the leaves becoming white for lack of
sunlight on this and on the fish these
people must have lived since that old
time

  egfoert who had been silent think-
ing turned his head sounds like
straight talk louis he said at any

rate the explanation is good but what
have yuh-what have any of yuh-got
to say about that occurrence at the
trial-about that weird old being called
the heart of fate who seems to have
haunted us so long

  the saints be wid us gordon said
i do belave thot spirut has been ladin
us ond lades us still

  egbert shrugged a shoulder i got
to allow that mike speaks true the
whole thing palls on me until i threw
that stone jar i can swear that for
some minutes all my acts were hardly
conscious to me i seemed to be
gripped by some fearful force how
did he turn to smoke this is the
twentieth century and we look for the
reasons for all such unusual happen-
ings a thing like this gets on my
nerves

  while yuh were fighting tingsley
said i asked the queen and judge
about this being but they seemed to be
afraid of him and gave me little satis-
faction they say however that for
all time since he first came with the old
band into the cave hes guided them
that his will always rules and always
will-he who they say is but the arm
of providence now that the body
at that pitcher throw has vanished
they are much puzzled and frank has
great prestige but not one grain of
fear for that strange hombre has left
them

  forches broke in he can be noth-
ing tut a man though we cant ex-
plain his acts they must be natural
the lost arts and sciences of the an-
cient egyptians are matters of history
the holy men of india to-day do
things which according to our phys-
ical laws are unbelievable lay the
things to hypnotism if you must but
lets forget them

  the wizard is at least well up in
drama i returned if not in melo-
drama but i confess i cant make it
out and it does give one the creeps

  no more was said and we fell to
our meal for though perturbed and
tired we were hungry the corn
proved delicious it seemed doubly so
as we for so long had been on a fish
diet when two other maidens clad in
white brought in some mushrooms for
dessert-triumphs of the culinary art
-our content waxed great and we ate
like pigs 

  these fungi forches said one
can account for easily they thrive in
caves if only started properly and cared
for these may be natural to the
pflace

  at last it was finished the maidens
brought us ewers of water wherein it
was evident we were expected to rinse
our hands then at their signals we
followed them and were shown to our
sleeping rooms here we were sep-
arated-a matter which i did not much
like forches tingsley and i were
given one apartment while egbert was
led to another wing of the palace a
chamber having been prepared for his
sole use gordon was distinguished
similarly still we did not object for
egbert thought it best to show our
confidence in our new friends

  our rooms contained in substance
all that modern civilization afforded
a high stone slab served as a dresser
and above it a mirror was affixed to
the wall-a mirror made of a thin sheet
of polished gold another stone served
as a table on which stood a basin of
the same metal and ewers of water
the treasure of the basques was ap-
parently the only metal the cave could
furnish lastly hut best of all were
beds with comfortable mattresses
stuffed with fiber and bedding of the
curious woven cloth which though
coarse was smooth to the touch and
white

  golly  said tingsley who had at
once mo oolized the toilet facilities

  we had put out our lights and
jumped in bed when at the door an-

other shone another maid appeared

and spoke in french the queen lias
sent me said she modestly to ask
your lordships if there is aught more
that you desire

  tingsley sat up and looked out
rather bashfully may i inquire he
asked why we are kept apart from
egbert and gordon

  the maid half understanding curt-
sied the holy man she asked
the holy man and egbert

  it is but fitting that the holy man
should be alone the better to indulge
in meditation and on the morrow min-
ister unto the people

  as to the honorable high judge
the girl went on in her soft voice it
is the queens own will he be alone and
in the palace end she occupies the
queens will is the peoples and it is

her known prerogative to- well

i speak too much it is for me to
serve not talk

  look here said tingsley can i
have my shirt laundered

 shirt- the maid looked

puzzled

  tingsley explained at length and
then repeated his explanation he
made his meaning clear for the girl
curtsied again and left us in a few
moments others came who with no
warning whatsoever grasped all the
clothes in sight-forches and mine as
well as tingsleys-and departed we
called to them in french but they not
understanding only looked back puz-
zled as they went while we sat there
aghast

  carter i said we shall he in a
nice mess if they should happen not to

bring them back

  i suppose said forches that car-
rying off a chaps clothes is another
prerogative of somebody in this

country

  the queens prerogative drawled
tingsley chuckling drowsily poor
frank king egbert the first
into the unknown



  do you think it will be as bad as
that i asked

  but tingsley had dropped asleep
with his last words and forches and i
soon followed suit

  we slept until awakened by a whistle
at the door we sat up blinking half
believing ourselves in a dream the
girl stood there again breakfast
she said in french will be all ready
shortly and soon thereafter it is
yuanas will that you all meet her in
the hall of records

  our fears for our clothes were
groundless they had been returned
each article was cleaned and pressed
most creditably

  then tingsley as the maid drew off
smiled beamingly upon his trousers and
pulled them on this is more like it
he said and having first monopolized
the washstand made himself appear
like a dude wrangler

  those freshened clothes felt good to
all and as we reached the dining hall
we felt like banqueters all ready for a
feast

 gordon was there and worried
oh misther clarence said he much
disturbed they hov put me in a big
rhoom all by mesilf its very foine
but thim folks shouldnt be allowed t
think i a-r-r a holy mon whin i a-r-r
not besoides i ought t be wid yez
still for the present you must be
one i answered until things are
more cleared up our safety may all de-
pend upon you

  just then frank egbert came and
tingsley smiled it seems the queen
said he already has designs upon yuh
signs of matrimony fill the air
egbert laughed and turned dull red
replying we must make plans to
get away from here next with a
weak attempt at joking it might be
worse eh clarence he added

  they served us with a dih resem-
bling breakfast food of some new
patent kind dressed up with oily stuff

like oleomargarine and with some
other things but best of all with plain
corn bread which we ate ravenously

  as we were finishing the maid who
spoke to us in french before and who
it seemed had been delegated to attend
us appeared again the queen de-
sires me to say said she that she
asks your lordships presence in an
hour in the hall of records the first
high judge now awaits you in the
throne room

  just as she led us forth we heard
the ringing of a bell which faintly
pierced the palace walls it was the
tolling we had heard before whose
psychic echo had pursued us ever since
the time we rescued the gay cat upon
the earth above and as the sounds
fell clearly on our ears they caused a
panorama of all that had occurred since
then to roll swiftly past in our memo-
ries

  those bells forever egbert said
as though annoyed they always fol-
low us there seems to be a meaning
in every stroke

  he turned to tingsley ask the
maid said he just what they are
we want to clear up this mystery once
and for all

  and tingsley asked the maid who
seemed surprised in answering  tis
but the minister pettiri garibay who
for the last time calls a congregation
to the church tis well he speaks no
more within the pulpit for no such
hypocrite has ever lived before

chapter xxiii

a matter of procedure

e found the aged judge waiting in
the throne room bending ab-
sorbed over the boat and examining
its contents in much curiosity

  good morning judge called ting-
sley quite familiarly how do yuh
like our craft

  arteche startled at our sudden ad-


western story magazine

vent seemed half mortified to think
that we had caught him meddling with
our property but he looked up and
smiled on hearing- tingsleys words
your pardon he apologized it is
so strange that it impels inquisitiveness
in the confusion of the conflict yester-
day it was left here is it not of
iron 

  yes answered porches in sur-
prise but how came yuh to know
it

  i did not knowr it but i thought it
said arteche satisfied it is like the
old gun of the first archu which now
lies in the royal cabinet

  and is bizente archils gun still
here asked tingsley

  the old man started as he heard the
wfords you know of bizente
archu he inquired in wonder yes
the gun remains and many other relics
which you shall see ere long

  i caught the thread of the old judges
words and now broke in of how
we chanced to learn of the first archil
woiild take a day to tell but you shall
have the story later on meanwhile
let me on my part question you of
things that puzzle me for i have pa-
tiently been waiting the opportunity

  arteche nodded his assent and i
spoke through tingsley who was a far
better hand than i at french good
judge i said i would learn first of
your court and of its methods for in
the land from which i came i have
made a specialty of law though still
not long in practice

  ah yes the court arteche an-
swered troubled we now lack one
for the third high judge who stood for
prejudice is dead having allied him-
self with aizkibel and fallen this
leaves but three the queen who repre-
sents the altruistic love and your
brave leader here who now replaces
aizkibel as conscienceless ambition
while i the sense of justice still pre-
side

  we must have four to judge and

yet although the seat of prejudice be
filled still are we tied for now the
heart of fate the arm of providence
in body has departed there is no ar-
biter it will be very difficult to give
fair trial then also do i fear the
left will prove too weak for though
we may replace the third high judge
yet does it seem that the new judge
your leader is far too good a man to
fill the seat of conscienceless ambition
he looked respectfully toward egbert
adding is he adept at juggling lies
these words thus falling from so
just looking a man whose actions had
not yet belied his looks struck me
most queerly and egbert as he heard
the sentence translated began to com-
prehend the situation which until then
we had neglected to explain

  he laughed and turned toward me
i see yuhr hand in this said he
yuhr aim was good but if i figure
rightly the old man expects that i shall
fiu aizkibets past seat in aizkibels
past spirit

  i shrugged a shoulder wait until
i get the hang of this i answered

  i turned to arteche puzzled your
words i said surprise me you
surely do not mean that you desire that
the fourth judtge shall lie that he
will not nor will he support evil
arteche looked at me in reproach
i do not understand he answered
writh simple dignity can he who
saved the queen and who in all that he
has done has aided and fulfilled the
right take a course that would deny to
all the clean just trial-a course that
in the end might break the kingdom

  most honorable judge i said i
cannot comprehend your words in our
country prejudice and evil lies and
such arc all held as vilest cancers and
kept out of court will you explain

further

  the old man half incredulous now
opened wide his eyes come  ou
into the unknown



from heaven he inquired half rev-
erently and half in sarcasm listen
thus do we

  four judges sit upon the bench and
each one strives his best to see that
what he represents shall triumph
thus love and prejudice the sense of
justice and ambition without con-
science lock their arms and if the four
are balanced and comes deadlock then
fate itself decides what do you more
than this

  i caught my breath why in our
land i answered every prisoner
must have a chance and those con-
tending hire lawyers who speak for
them a jury of twelve men must pass
the verdict these twelve who must
be satisfactory to both must be unani-
mous in their decision and over all
one judge presides who gives the sen-
tence he who is just must still be
guided by the nations laws

  the old judge at these words looked
puzzled can twelve men think
alike he asked

  i paused at his blunt question but
still i answeredi unless they do the
trial is held again with twelve others
arteche smiled uncertainly then
let me ask said he if in your land
of so much justice each of these hire-
lings whom you call lawyers is just as
skillful-but no more so-as each
other one

  naturally they are not i an-
swered a learned one may be worth
a half a hundred others

  then asked arteche is it not a
fact that where they seek for gold
the side of greater property can hire
the greater lawyer

  it often is the case i returned
yet lawyers by themselves can never
win for each must follow what pre-
vails as law

  his old eyes twinkled you are
young said he yet much above a
child your eyes are open the ex-
change used by your people is gold 

our wealth is figured differently in
either case there must be some cor-
ruption for all men are weak under
your system may not corruption eat
the heart of truth most men desire
wealth no matter what their vocation
may be

  most learned judge i said as you
yourself pronounce no men are per-
fect we do our best to see that in
all things justice reigns

  arteche brightened but bowed in re-
spect do not be angered he replied
i only glean information now do i
see your courts are much like ours
you too have prejudice and lies cor-
ruption love and partial justice that is
all yet these things must all come in
with human nature and perfect fair-
ness comes only when our god is judge
with us fate casts the final vote so
are we well assured of justice for fate
is but the arm of providence who is
just this life is but a little of the
whole if things dont balance rightly
here much time remains hereafter

  what answer i should have given
him i do not know but i was saved
for now a messenger came in and con-
versed with him excitedly

 arteche somewhat grave then
turned to us again already are the
people clamoring for the new holy
man he said i have set the service
for two hours hence

  hardly had he finished when a maid
arrived the queen gives audience
within the hall of records she an-
nounced

chapter xxiv

yuana archu queen of new biscay

the hall of records proved to be the
large room which we had entered
first when led as prisoners into the
palace it now began to dawn on us
that those stone slabs which we had
seen before upon the shelves held the
literature of the strange people for
characters quite evident in those that


western story magazine

lay about were scratched on either sur-
face this we noted as we waited for

the queen

  as she entered flanked by two of
her ladies in waiting we bowed hardly
knowing what court custom was ex-
pected of us our salutation was gra-
ciously returned and the queen seated
herself at the head of the large table
her attendants remaining standing be-
hind her chair a pause fell following
our exchange of formal greetings
finally yuana spoke and while she
included all of us in her words her
eyes rested on egbert

  friends she said for after your
service i know that you are friends-
let there be no pretense between us
in the land of brightness from which
you have so singularly come your sta-
tion equals mine this i know from
your manner and bearing and from
what my lord tingsley told me of your
customs while he stood on guard in the
fighting of yesterday i beg you then
regard this not as an audience but
rather as a council my lord egbert
shall sit on my right your holy man on
my left my lords tingsley forches
and burden opposite

  again we bowed and egbert bend-
ing his curly head answered we
come yuhr majesty at yuhr request
and place ourselves gladly at yuhr dis-
posal

  noble egbert replied yuana with
simple dignity i pray thee then sit
down beside me

  in fairness to the queen f cannot
record egberts reluctance he met the
candor of her preference with a frank-
ness almost if not quite as elemental
i say almost because as he took his
seat his eyes met mine and he had
the grace to turn a deep red but
yuana queen though she was was still
but a girl grown to womanhood un-
educated in emotional concealment and
with all the innocence of a child of
this we were to have further evidence

  it would be well she declared
beiore we counsel together that i
should know more of you than your
fathers names how came you in our
kingdom and whence let my lord
tingsley tell me more

  tingsley thus called upon entered
into an abridged account of all that lias
been hereinbefore written yuana
listened in deepest interest her eyes
shining with excitement at those
parts of the narrative in which frank
egberts exploits led she clapped her
hands gleefully yet in some curious
way though it was the action of a
child it was still that of a queen and
did not lessen nor break our regard

  and whence come you she asked
as he finished

  tingsley gave our several histories
briefly

  for reply queen yuana turned to
egbert and to his great discomfiture
ran her white fingers through his curly
hair frank she said slowly yours
is a well-sounding name my people
frank will love and work for you

  i choked and egbert shot a furious
burning look at me as now again she
turned toward tingsley of this land
of yours said she i know not is
it a land where there is always light

   it is light half the time at day and
dark the other half at night

  is it a great land with a ball of
fire in the sky  she queried

  you mean the sun

  yuana half arose in interested ex-
citement yes that is it she an-
swered the-the sun is it thus
you say it the word is in our records
but i have never heard it spoken by
those accustomed to using it there is
then reallv such a thing ves the
sun andis this land colorado upon
the bay of biscay	

  tingsley shook his head no ne
returned in the united states of

america	

  yuana settled back in disappoint-
into the unknown



ment america she said yes it
too is on the records-the new coun-
try above there must be towns which
have grown up in it

  hundreds of towns and cities and
one of the most powerful governments
in the world said tingsley

  the queen looked puzzled it must
be very wondrous she said and turn-
ing to egbert she added frank-
pausing upon the wrord as though to
weigh its sound-live more like thee
in colorado

  egbert looked around at us helplessly
for aid we did not give it

  oh yes he replied in palpable dis-
tress many much like me but better
the queen surveyed him directly for
a moment do not tell me untruth
she said calmly it is not possible
we believe with you o queen i
said and for the first time got my re-
ward in a smile

  truly you are wise she gave back
to me

  tell me now she added how it
comes that thou clarence hast a holy
man as servant art thou so holy
even now the people are clamoring to
have mike gordon high religious poten-
tate of all the realm in place of pettiri
garibay whom aizkibel has cor-
rupted and who in turn has misled
many of my people turning them
against me by vile lies so it must be
i fear that clarence and mike gordon
shall part but how is a holy man a
servant 

  my french could not equal the oc-
casion and tingsley followed with the
explanation that by command gordon
had acted holy man to save our lives

  yuana shook her head it seem
not right said she that such should
be holy ruler have my people made
him holy ruler was he doubtless born
and holy ruler he must remain

  it may be so i said for i already
had seen the necessity of gordon con-
tinuing in his part your wishes gra-
d-w

cious queen are ours and now that
we have told you all i pray you tell us
of yourself of this place of its people
-of all for all is new

  yuana inclined her head in assent

it is fitting she said nay more-it
is well for you my lords to know all
of our kingdom of new biscay since
its fortunes and ours now lie between
us all

  i am the last of the house of
archu of the first bizente archu
you already know of that great wiz-
ard from the east who came to his
brave band from that wrecked galleon
you know too she glanced half ap-
prehensively around the hall hesitated 
and went on his power you have
seen he the heart of fate the arm
of providence lias always guided us
and though he has now seen fit to go
in body he will still remain you did
face him frank how dared you

 there has been handed down
through generations of our kings a se-
cret prophecy that after the going of
the last male member bearing archus
name a stranger should appear and
that with his coming the heart should
go when all the country should run
blood but afterward that peace un-
known should come her voice grew
low the stranger has appeared  the
prophecys fulfillment now begins

  you learned much from the papers
you discovered with the body of poor
astarloa who tried in vain to reach
the surface bizente archu was as
you surmised the leader of that band
which first concealed the gold within
the cavern where hostile indians and
this great wizard held them and
with escape cut off the wizard said
now found a model country be its
king as the arm of providence so
willed bizente archu obeyed

  until my father died we were
kings-i alas am but a woman

  when the heart of fate locked that
first band within the earth by causing

i


western story magazine

huge rocks to fall he locked the treas-
ure with them the highest duty of
the crown has been to guard the gold
you found it was bizente archus
trust and thus the trust of all his blood
what lias been taken was of necessity
-for the use of our people for weap-
ons of defense and for adornment of
the court for this our holy men ab-
solved us but the gold remains-even
that we are now using-for the chil-
drens children of bizente archus
king who never come

  none save a chosen guard approach
che treasure cave to trespass is to
die the way is watched by night and
by day and even in the building of
this palace the first archu placed it
between the city and the pathway for
this gold many traitors to the govern-
ment have died since to gain it is to
gain the kingdom it is an article of
such utility in manufacture and the
arts that nothing in new biscay can
replace it to lose it is to lose our lives
such then is the value of that which
you attempted to despoil

  we did not know said forches
true assented yuana yet will
the traitor aizkibel point out your act
and so inflame the minds of those who
be not loyal

  we shall be enough asserted eg-
bert confidently and the queens eyes
rested upon him

  if the heart of fate so wills it
she returned

  whether he wills it or not said
egbert laughing but his laughing
dwindled and he stopped and as he
did so a sudden strange unrest came
over us

  yuana put her white hands to him
in fear frank i she cried and fell
into a silent shaking terror

it shall be as yuh say yuhr
majesty said egbert nervously but
gently if yuh so wish we will not
speak of it tell me now of aizkibel
for a further space the queen kept

silent  hen at last she gained
enough control to speak her voice still
shook and her glances strayed from
side to side lieutenant to archu the
first was guillen aizkibel who proved
a great disappointment to my brave
forefather in his need in bizente
archus later years guillen aizkibel
turned trvitor and tried to wrest the
kingdom from his hands there was
much lighting in a little way for aiz-
kibel had followers besides his
brother at an early period of the con-
finement had left for the surface
which it was supposed that he had
reached and ere departing he had
sworn that in time he would return
with a rescuing party hence though
my forefather had sent astarloa on the
same errand guillen aizkibel gained
prestige which was difficult to break
also the fact that his brothers act had
been one of insubordination made the
situation more difficult whether or
not this brother was killed by hostile
indians there is no way of telling but
neither he nor astarloa ever returned
later bizente archu discovered that
these two aizkibels had been intriguing
to procure the gold for themselves after
accomplishing the murder of the loyal
ones the proof was not quite clear
enough to warrant aizkibels execu-
tion  but still there was no doubt of the
truth of the report nevertheless in
consequence aizkibel was degraded in
his rank and closely watched this
tale is necessary to what conies

  from that day until this the aizki-
bels have been a source of constant
trouble to the throne and constantly
they have been striving to blind our
good people turning them against us b
their lies and by contention that the
aizkibels themselves were rightful
rulers and that the archus had usurped
the throne they have used all the
cunning they could summon to accom-
plish their purpose but till recently
in vain
into the unknown



  my father who at all times kept
the nations welfare close to heart con-
ceived the idea of healing this old
breach and thought he saw a chance
when edrigu aizkibels father died
leaving him orphaned at an early age

  he at once befriended yonng aiz-
kibel making him one of the palace
guards as he grew older at first the
movement seemed a good one for cer-
tain of the people from among the dis-
affected were appeased and grew more
loyal

  my father died and i in my desire
to carry out his wishes later made
young aizkibel fourth judge of new
biscay-one quarter dictator below the
heart and second in command by his
position over all the guards

  i soon saw my mistake but it was
too late no judge can be removed
except for well-proved treason edrigu
aizkibel began to force his attentions
upon me

  of the rest my friends there is but
little necessary to relate i detested
him as i do now and in his courtship
i perceived only ambition to gain pos-
session of the throne-i was to be a
means to an unscrupulous end so i
refused the man who had no right to
make the offer and who should have
awaited the pleasure of the queen

  he was angered and swore that i
should live to rue the day i have not
rued the day thank heaven  but he
has nearly succeeded in gaining the
throne he has done this through in-
timidation of those over whom his
power could be exerted by lies to those
he could not so intimidate and by most
subtle intrigue through which he has
exerted constantly an unseen influence
over the court and many of the guards
he has schemed and dabbled in his
devilment until he had one half the
judges and the large number of the
palace force behind him he corrupted
even garibay as i have said and tried
to turn the citizens against me but in

spite of all his efforts most of the
people and a minority of my guards
remained loyal

  seeing that he no longer could in-
crease his scope of power and fearing
the results of fighting he came to me
again this time as a bully demanding
marriage once more did i refuse him
and at my words his rage passed every
bound he said that i was but a pup-
pet in his hands that i had best make
what i could out of the situation and
that it would be far better to become
his wife at once than something far
less honorable later

  his cruel threats however were for
naught i scorned him once again and
soon thereafter felt that my firm stand
was gaining me a few recruits from
those upon his side doubtless he had
held some of these men by telling them
that sooner or later but most inevitably
i would become his wife

  i confided my agony to ganis ar-
teche the faithful first high judge who
went to aizkibel in protestation the
only result was that from that time on
i was held a close prisoner in the pal-
ace and to me aizkibel threatened my
life should i speak of the affair to any
one again

  the low-down coyote burst forth
egbert and the rest of us echoed his
rage the queen had told her story
with such brave simplicity that it had
held us and as her girlish voice broke
with a little pathetic quiver as she fin-
ished we felt our wrath rise mightily
within us if aizkibel had been at
hand it certainly would not have fared
well with him

  even gordon to whom tingsley had
translated rose in his anger faith
ill wring his neck he muttered and
brought his fist down on the table
sure miss quane he roared moike
gordonll prache in inny rocks thot yez
say t do up thot rascal aizykittle

  i felt a thrill at gordons w-ords as
all turned toward him and the queen
western story magazine

 

when tingsley had translated them to
her was much affected she turned
in heartfelt gratitude toward gordon
believe me most high religious poten-
tate she said for you are now ap-
pointed i will make sure that you never
shall regret it it now is ten the people
flock to service at half past eleven

  she turned to one of her attendants
take the high potentate to his room
said she and let him be invested with
his garments

  as gordon disappeared i said
you mention hours you cannot have
clocks 

  clocks she was puzzled you
mean how get we the time

  yes

  we have sand she laughed as
she spoke pure sand falls through
a small rock orifice at a set rate and
annually are we fairly well checked by
the rising of the waters in the spring

  this church i asked is it far
from the palace i cannot allow mike
to take too big a risk

  fear not she answered reassur-
ingly  tis but a step and he shall
have my guards continually around him
known or unknown to himself and to
the enemy

  i rested more easily on hearing this
but was determined to watch closely

  our council is now ended said the
queen yet my lord frank i would
detain with me for a space

  and tingsley forches and i left in
the cold walked ruefully back toward
the throne room on entering which we
found the first high judge ganis ar-
teche still absorbed in studying the boat

chapter xxv

a preacher by requisition

t he old judge seeing us stepped
forward i am pleased said he
ceremoniously to hear that the
holy man will be among the people
soon it augurs well

  we have learned of yuhr situation
tingsley answered and are more than
ready to cast in our lots with the queen
and to save the kingdom if we can

  arteche bowed it is well he said

  how many people lias new bis-
cay forches asked

  by the latest count there were in
new biscay five thousand two hundred
and eighty one in mau about two hun-
dred more those in mau are tran-
sients comprising some of the queens
best men sent down to guard the out-
posts from time to time they are re-
lieved by others

  tingsley stood looking at the judge
uncertainly five thousand he ex-
claimed as though half doubtful
whether he had heard aright

  but forches made a rapid calcula-
tion not so surprising he observed
supposing there were twenty families
at first since  there must have
been a dozen generations the figures
can be passed by simply doubling with
each

  arteche seemed to divine our
thoughts the crabs of mau have
taken many he said you know
them not nor would you wish to in
truth they are new biscays bitterest
foe they run most frequently within
the fall

  while we stood mystified over his
words and before he could explain at
length a guard strode through the
southern arching doorway and stood at
attention before us arteche gave him
permission to speak

  o most high judge said he the
people demand the new holy man the
hour is passed

  arteche turned to us if it meets
your will my lords the high potentate
shall go lest our people change their
temper

  it shall be so i answered we
also will attend	

  your words are of wisdom the
judge replied it will be well for our
into the unknown



people to see you twelve of the pal-
ace guard shall act as escort and my
lord egbert shall lead for it is he to
whom the people look

  why egbert to our thoughts per-
haps an answer lay in the fact that he
had saved yuanas life had dared the
wizard and for the time at least had
downed intriguing aizkibel but was
that all

  tingsley and i turned to go but
forches now delayed us while we
were talking he though listening had
been ransacking a compartment of the
boat and had drawn forth an aneroid
barometer at which he gazed aston-
ished by heaven he exclaimed
this instrument shows scarcely any
altitude at all we must be nearly at
sea level ill check the reading later
by determining the temperature at
which water boils

  diverted by his interesting words we
hesitated

  he made quick readings with the
compass and the dipping needle-things
he had brought along unknown to us
and which were useful to him in his
study of the strata he entered the few
data in a notebook with the idea he
said of identifying the spot for future
reference should we at some time reach
the surface we should have done
this before en route he said i for-
got it-worse luck

  arteche and the guard were waiting
but forches still begged a moments de-
lay before we go said he i would
like to have this boat taken to our
chamber can it be done

  of a certainty returned arteche
after a moment of surprise and sum-
moning some men he had it moved
while we sought mike gordon

  he was standing in his sanctum be-
fore a mirror as we entered regarding
his new costume with doubtful admira-
tion while he was made uncomfortable
by the presence of a woman servant
who apparently had been delegated to

aid him in the final touches to his toilet
he presented a peculiar sight in his
white robe flowing in folds and belted
at the waist

  misther clarence said he relieved
i am glad yez came they rubbed me
hair away with sharpened stones ond
thried t take me clothes off but i sez
not by a big soight ond pulled this
noight gown on mesilf on top av thim
ond all the lingo thot they foired at me
made no diffrence

  thats right mike i replied keep
your clothes your shoes your temper
and your weapon

  forches and tingsley seeing that
gordon was nearly ready now left to
bring egbert and yuana and i added
be as quick as you can mike it is
about time for service and the people
are already calling for you

  good grief he replied must i
hov services so quick

  you need not worry i returned
the people will not understand you
just keep your nerve with you and do
your best all will go well for we and
other friends will be near by

  sure misther clarence thot i will
he answered earnestly

  i led him to the throne room where
we found the rest already congregated
there i was made acquainted with the
fact that the old functionary had when
asked refused to abdicate and when
he had been ejected from the church by
loyal guards had at once located him-
self in another quarter where he an-
nounced he would continue carrying on
services

  we wound out through the gates
across the road and in between a
myriad pillars and finally surrounded
by excited crowds arrived at our des-
tination

  the house of worship was in every
way complete it was a dome-shaped
room of great proportions all hung at
the top and sides with those inevitable
glistening stalactites which seemed to


western story magazine

be kept scoured white out of a great
stalagmite at one end was carved a mas-
sive pulpit from which gordon held
forth stone benches fitted with soft
mattinglike stuffed seats branched
back a hundred feet half radiating
from the preachers stand

  our group occupied the seat in front
-a matter of gratification to us as we
wished to be near gordon and to his
congregation to whom we were strange
awe-inspiring beings who excited curi-
osity and whom they wished to see

   if a congregations size is a criterion
by which to judge a preachers success
mike gordon stood supreme that day
the church i fancy had never been so
filled before some came sincerely
with true thought for worshiping
more no doubt were led by an over-
powering curiosity but they all came-
as many men as women pettiri gari-
bay who was endeavoring to hold forth
at another spot across the town had we
were told afterward only bare walls to
speak to and at length seeing that ef-
forts to stem the tide were vain him-
self succumbed and stole into gordons
congregation at the rear

  as to the new holy man he held his
bearers spellbound he spoke in eng-
lish and sang in english but they drank
in every sound though understanding
nothing i could see that many were
surprised at the nature of the service
which took its form as gordon went
on and of necessity was more or less
irregular he was not as thoroughly
prepared as he might well have been
but he fascinated the people which wa
sufficient

  the tears were running from his
eyes striking the comers of his mouth
as he finished oh misther clar-
ence he said sobbing softly ond t
think moike gordon ud be sich a hyp-
ocrite its hivens gates as is shut up
before me now

  rot mike i answered cheering
him you have as good a right to

preach as garibay that you are just
as capable and far more conscientious
we all know you have succeeded
splendidly

  gordon seemed somewhat comforted
well misther clarence he returned
i done it in a good cause innyhow
and then with due dignity and respect
we took mike gordon to the palace
gates again and as he passed unwill-
ingly within we left him turning back
to get our first full glimpse of that
strange settlement called by its stranger
people new biscay

chapter xxvi

through the hidden city

t o go into all details of our trip
would cause too much divergence
from my story new biscay while even
more wonderful than we had expected
we found to be similar in many respects
to our own cities on the earth above
each family was housed in its own
chamber in the rocks each chamber
was furnished with its benches bed and
tables some homes were more elabo-
rately equipped than others and some
inhabited by the most prosperous al-
most equaled the palace itself in size
most however were extremely small

  our whole experience was like a
great triumphal march crowds flocked
up from all around and followed us
bowing and saluting in deep awe or
cheering and looking for the most part
toward frank egbert twice would
we have been swept off our feet but
for the efficient service of the guards

  across the city we came on what we
soon found to be the industrial section
enormous chambers filled with laborers
and skilled workmen drew our interest
many were busily engaged in grinding
corn in huge stone mortars making
flour and others were treating leaves
and stems in strange ways

  in a great hall-like place we saw ma-
chines made most ingeniously of bone
into the unknown



and rock and little rods of gold and
cords which hummed and buzzed as
women sat before them weaving odd
fabrics coarse and fine out of the
treated corn shreds the operatives
stopped and wildly gazed at us as we
arrived and were with difficulty in-
duced to work again

  many other strange things we saw
but passed at length through a stone
arch and down a little grade when all
at once there burst to view a sheet of
nearly stagnant water like a long
lagoon which seemed to stretch away
indefinitely toward the right on either
bank were narrow strips of soil
crowded with vegetation mostly corn
here lay the secret of that whole com-
munity-the peoples staff of life

  we stood upon the rocks and looked
the whitened leaves were visible along
the banks so far as we could see the
somewhat dwarfed and stubby plants
bending away from us before a breeze
which was so uniform that the leaves
barely fluttered and but for the sough-
ing wind and the sweep of its draft
one would hardly have known that it
existed the effect of this phenom-
enon was weird and for a moment
it kept us silent

  forches glanced around studying the
situation this air current said he
is evidently what keeps the atmos-
phere so fresh ask the guard car-
ter where it comes from above

  ben at aranpe leader of the guards
answered from an unknown place
across the city beyond small holes that
no one can explore through which it
whistles

  another opening to the surface
forches said must lie at some far-
distant point he looked down the
lagoon how far do these cornfields
extend he asked

  aranpe for some reason shrugged
his shoulders to mau he answered
as though he were disturbed a mat-
ter of some fifty miles

  we crossed the water in a well-built
boat of which a number lay near by
the vessel was constructed all of cloth
and bones and cord the sides and bot-
tom undulating with each movement

  a wapsey boat said egbert and
the kind the gay cat said he saw i
have no doubt that one was being nav-
igated up above as he went down the
falls

  the row was short the opposite
shore being only thirty feet away we
went up some distance stopping at a
flight of steps which we ascended
emerging on a platform well above the
level of the water where we remained
while the boat was taken back to bring
its second load

  we now could rest the crowd was
left behind we found the view toward
the south most fascinating i turned
and looked upon the scene as dante
looked upon deaths mysteries occa-
sional blue flames shot up toward the
roof from clearings in the cornfields
and their tongues like those pale corn-
stalks bent away without a movement
forced by the same unchanging sough-
ing wind in which all sounds were lost
save the low conversation of the guards

  i stood as in a dream almost be-
lieving it was death i looked upon
the pale and crooked helmsman in
that whitened world guiding his final
load through the deep sluggish cur-
rent resembled charon taking lost souls
across the river styx

  i started to hear tingsley speaking
to aranpe for what use is this plat-
form he inquired

  the guard saluted this is the
queens own booth he answered to
which at times she comes to watch the
harvesting or to rest it also is he
added half in hesitation the position
from which operations are directed
when the crabs of mau are running

  here were the crabs of mau again
tingsley grew curious what are
they he demanded


western story magazine

  aranpe slirugged a shoulder for-
bid it said he that they shall run
this year they nearly always come
upon us in the fall

  that was the most we could get from
him the thing as it had been before
remained a deep enigma for when we
asked him why they were so feared and
whence they came and tried to lead him
on he either could not or would not
understand our questions we left the
spot and moved toward the palace
which was not far away for vve had
made a circuit in our traveling

  not far within the gates sat gordon
waiting for us surrounded by solicitous
attendants he had not moved since we
had left him im glad t see yez
back said he ond misther clar-
ence i do belave we done it the
peopul a-r-r in-thoosiastic ond i guess
thot garribahy lad a-r-r on the run
aranpe led us to the throne room
where the queen was awaiting our re-
turn she had just learned of gordons
success with the people through ar-
teche and they were talking of it
eagerly as she saw egbert she broke
off her conversation abruptly and ran
forward to meet him seizing his hands
in hers-an action egbert did not
hamper either from desire or circum-
spection

  you are safe back my lord frank
she cried happily did you see all
what do you think of my possessions
are they as great as colorado

  egbert smiled down on her not
quite so large o queen he answered
yet they are much more interesting
then she replied in disappoint-
ment you are a greater prince than i
a queen

  if egbert strove to put her at her
ease his efforts went much further
than any he had ever used before to
comfort womankind believe me
he returned i am no prince but if
 was yuh would still be greater for
yuh are by yuhrself so wonderful that

yuhr country is as nothing in compar-
ison

  yuanas features fairly radiated joy
you are a courtier frank she said
softly with a courtiers gift of grace-
ful speech yet as a woman  surely
am not half so wonderful as you are
as a man

  enough exists in new biscay to fill
a book much for my present purposes
i must pass by a restless night or two
of dreams of that strange wizard who
for all time seemed to have left the
place a day or two spent in conversa-
tions with our hosts and in wandering
about our new-found home and in a
measure we became adapted to condi-
tions

  but there was no delay at all in eg-
berts action and he began at once as-
sisting arteche and queen yuana in
their efforts to put our army of de-
fense in better shape

chapter xxvii

the danger signal

i t nfortunately aizkibel had
 not been captured we having come
upon no trace of him throughout the
city the matter was a source of some
disturbance to us for he still had fol-
lowing and if alive we felt that it
would not be long before he would show
his hand while waiting for develop-
ments we spent the time improving our
acquaintance with our prison for de-
spite our comfort we could regard new
biscay as nothing else

  our interest was particularly excited
by the great use of bone among the
people and we were at an utter loss in
our speculations as to the source o
supply the long handles of the spears
the bridge supports parts of machinery
and many other things were made from
it in fact it almost seemed to take t ie
place of wood or iron in the outer

world
into the unknown



  but strangely all our inquiries re-
garding it were fruitless if we were
answered at all-and more often we
were met by silence-we received no
knowledge our questions on all other
subjects were met with immediate re-
sponse but when we asked about the
bone we were given evasions accom-
panied in each case by unmistakable
fear

  we asked arteche but even here we
failed and we did not get a hint of
whence it came until we spoke to yu-
ana herself even she seemed almost
trembling as she answered us speak
not about the crabs of mau she
begged it is the law the heart of
fate so wills it it is enough to know
hey run

  she was so troubled that egbert in
his sympathy indignantly insisted that
until some future time we let the mat-
ter drop

  most husky crabs indeed the things
must be said forches when we were
again alone fi sooner would believe
that these apparent bones are imitations
manufactured by some secret process
but-growing serious-we must yet
find such a solution

  the guards now having been reorgan-
ized egbert without delay began to
turn attention toward the government

  when it came to the court they called
on me for as a lawyer i was sup-
posed to have ability in this direction
trial by jury being unknown in that
land it was most difficult to get them
started right they looked askance at
my suggestions and said twelve men
nor yet a hundred never could replace
the heart of fate however after
much discussion backed as i was by
egbert and as i managed to become
regarded with signs of good will more
and more by queen yuana and ar-
teche they fell into line persuaded that
this new ai rangement was the wizard s
will that awesome picture where the
fire had struck that night upon the table

still remained and caused strange
wondering thoughts to well up in our
minds whenever we looked down on it
it was arranged that at each trial the
jurymen should sit around the slata
thing that satisfied them for it carried
deep symbolic meaning

  another snag was struck when we
tried to replace the four abstractions by
one presiding judge but egbert tact-
fully insisting that arteche was the
proper person for the seat smoothed
the objections over and we soon had
everything progressing favorably

  egbert grew busier with new duties
and his consultations with yuana every
day he picked up french more rap-
idly than any of the rest of us and in
an amazingly short time he mastered
sufficient words and phrases of the com-
mon tongue to make himself fairly well
understood in more important matters
-a thing we marveled at until we
found that the queen had been consci-
entiously teaching him as time went
on he shortened many of his other
duties and prolonged his lessons

  tingsley for a while was in his ele-
ment he sat in the hall of records
reading the old inscriptions and perk-
ing up his bandanna by day he wan-
dered about the palace and the city
streets making acquaintances studying
historic points and ancient relics and
picking up the language his peace
was short for force of circumstances
with relentless grip fell on him as well
as gordon shortly after our appear-
ance in the place he had dressed the
wound of the guard whom small had
shot with such good results that he had
gained great reputation as a surgeon
and a doctor others solicited his serv-
ices and he at first responding in good
nature grew still more famous until
conditions molded him a calling too

  forches spent nearly all his time at
first outside the palace studying rocks
and vegetation making scientific ob-
servations mapping the city and


western story magazine

sketching great pictures of the strange
life and its surroundings on white cloth
he had procured so great a reputa-
tion did he shortly gain that many of-
fered him inducements to portray them
the queen heard of his skill and sat for
him likewise he had to draw upon
the rocks within the throne room a
wondrous picture of that heart of
fate-an undertaking which he did not
relish

  small had not reappeared nor had
we heard of him dead or alive beyond
the meager information we had ob-
tained after the skirmish we had then
traced him to the outskirts of the city
and some claimed to have seen him
wandering into the limitless passages
beyond as time went on we grew to
think him dead

  no word had come of aizkibel nor
any indication of his presence our
guards sent out as secret-service men
among the people learned no more of
him and coming back reported that
all was well the citizens appeared
contented quiet and loyal and new
biscay seemed to have entered upon an
era of peace

  thus time flew on and with its pas-
sage we helped new biscay with the
knowledge of our outer world forches
discovered refuse heaps beyond the city
-the waste of vegetable remains for
generations which had been piled in
distant unfrequented passages and was
all covered with a white deposit which
he identified as saltpeter egbert heated
it with charcoal made from corn and
thus procured potassium carbonate the
one ingredient of glass which had been
lacking-limestone and sand there was
in plenty soon we were using rough
glass plates and tumblers and window-
panes were introduced

  he showed the people how to manu-
facture caustic potash by treating the
same substance with slaked lime and
with this chemical they were soon mak-
ing soap if we had sulphur he re-

marked i would feel satisfied its all
i need to manufacture gunpowder with
which we could project our enemies to
kingdom come

  forches unearthed a bed of shale
and egbert made cement we taught
its use and almost before we knew it
the basques were building concrete
dams and other structures

  with it all our romance thrived i
dont believe that eglert realized where
he was drifting he had never cared
for women and had never had a great
tendresse in his life but within him-
self he was primeval free from false
pride and all hypocrisy and emotionally
moving in a straight line without con-
cealment wherever his emotions led
in the queen he had met another like
himself untrammeled by any of the
bonds of our social systems-a woman
unspoiled he perhaps could never
have met her like elsewhere at all
events the two drew steadily together
we saw the possibility of complications
yet could not help ourselves

  but we were not destined to use all
our time in bettering conditions in new
biscay the queen who had so frankly
robbed us of egberts company strove
earnestly to make our leisure moments
pleasurable i am not sure but that
within her heart she sought to find us
mates

  we soon grew well acquainted with
the ladies of the court of whom clera
aranpe sister of the leader of the
guards margata barnetche and mada-
lon baratcart barring the queen held
higher social standing than any other
women in the kingdom we saw much
of them and needed little urging to
seek the society of the first two who
were young and beautiful madalon
baratcart however was unfortunate in
that youth was no longer her portion
i should have judged her past forty
and it was certain that she had never
been blessed with the most fascinating
graces
into the unknown



  gordon as a holy man was naturally
not provided for but whenever we
were with them and his time allowed
he tagged along in moody watchful
silence yuana by her will and his
appropriated egbert and margata
barnetche and forches usually were
together by some chance clera
aranpe and i gravitated toward each
other this left madalon baratcart
with tingsley-a circumstance which
pleased her immensely without eliciting
a corresponding enthusiasm in him

  it came to pass that on an evening
we all sat at our supper before a table
in the gardens close to the glistening
spray and mounting flame of blue at
that spot where at first we saw the
queen care was forgotten in our in-
teresting company as maidens came
and went with appetizing viands and
empty dishes

  after the meal was over we paired
as usual and walked among the flowers
for all of us save tingsley time passed
in content and for one of us in more
than that it was perhaps natural that
tingsley should have first observed the
guard who strode up the path

  who comes he asked

  the guard saluted one my lord
who seeks the queen he answered
he waits without the palace gates

  it was not difficult to find yuana
tingsley bowing his excuse to mada-
lon baratcart sought the most shel-
tered end of the gardens and returned
with her and egbert

  she listened to the message with a
puzzled air one seeks an audience
at such an hour she said how is
he named and of what appearance
is he

  i know him not o queen the
guard replied save as a former fol-
lower of aizkibel-a citizen he states
he comes in loyalty and bears important
tidings

  it is not the hour for messages the
queen returned

  but egbert turned to her there
may be news in this that we should
know said he shall not benat
aranpe bring him in

  you think so asked yuana then
it shall be thus

  bid aranpe disarm him if he car-
ries weapons egbert commanded

  the guard turned hastening down
the path and clera aranpe speaking
to me in an undertone said trust
benat

  soon afterward aranpe brought his
charge before us as he reached the
queen he knelt nor would he speak
until she bade him

  i crave forgiveness he began for
this disturbance of your majesty but i
bring news last night they say aiz-
kibel came to a lonely corner of the
city talking to pettiri garibay and
others to-day garibay spoke softly
to me with fair words of aizkibel say-
ing that ere long man- would rise with
him and proclaim him king of these
things do i hasten to inform thee o
my queen

  aizkibel cried egbert

  the queen grew serious and still and
turned to him but said no word at
first then she looked back upon the
kneeling man

  thou hast done well said she
will you be among my guards

  i will serve thee with my life my
queen the newcomer replied humbly
rise then yuana said

  see to it aranpe

  the leader of the guards saluted and
the man bowed low

  egbert spoke to aranpe lose no
time said he but have the city
scoured for aizkibel this movement
must be nipped before it grows

  mike i half censured gordon
what about this have you lost any
of your congregation 

  gordon looked up somewhat
ashamed well misther clarence

attacked in cave by a myriad bats

an ecitils experience was encountered recently by george bayes a geologist
  who was exploring a cave in the vicnity of mount adams washington w hen
he had progressed considerable distance into the cave he found himself sur-
rounded by a myriad bats startled by the presence of bayes in the cave the
bats became terrified and in their mad circling back and forth baves himself
did not know whether he was to be attacked or not in throwing his hands
wildly around his head to ward them off he clinched one by the neck and
carried n out of the cave with him the specimen was an unusuallv lare one
measuring nearly sixteen inches from tip to tip this is the first occasion brought
to public attention showing bats in an ice-filled cavern

large number of rattlesnakes reported in

washington

tra elers ill the state of washington during the last few months have
reported upon the unusually large number of rattlesnakes they have en-
countered in sections where previously only very few were noticed it is thought
that the reptiles have been forced to seek shelter in the creek bottoms because
of the poison campaigns which have been waged against gophers mice and
ground squirrels field mice the natural food of the northwest rattlers have
been destroyed in great numbers by the biological survey demonstrations the
scarcity of natural food is given as the reason why there have been so many
attacks upon cows and sheep by rattlers a single rancher killed ten snakes
in the south touchet valley after one had attacked a horse on the nose ranchers
have been obliged to protect themselves from sudden attacks by rattlers while
working in their alfalfa fields by wearing tar-paper leggings

snowbanks aid late strawberry crop

a strawberry patch refrigerated by nature and said to be the only one
 of its kind is owned by c e arnold who has a ranch near ashford
washington part of arnolds ranch lies close to the summit of bald butte
whose altitude is  feet in the wintertime the canons thereabouts are filled
deep with snow being protected from the sun most of the day it lasts until well
into midsummer the ranch owner conceived the clever idea of planting mar-
shall strawberries along the edges of the canon where soil is good in this way
holding back his crop until the early crops are gone in the late summer months
arnold is able to ship fine spring varieties to fancy trade which realize higher
prices during the winter months he will protect his vines by a covering of
cedar and balsim boughs when next spring comes his strawberry crop will
again begin to grow maturing slowly so that the crop will not be ready until
late summer

aving read the morning
paper and smoked a ci-
gar in the lobby of a
luxurious tourist hotel in
los angeles enos whit-
taker proceeded to take
his daily stroll down spring street
the stroll was a regular event at any
rate to the extent that enos had thus
found exercise and recreation for five
successive days

  the air was balmy the streets and
sidewalks crowded the shop windows
attractive enos whittaker took a deep
breath of delight

  the more i get into this life he
remarked to himself the more i can
see that im a-going to like it he
stood still for a moment looking down
the street and now he added its
high time i made a good careful in-
vestment of the money theres no
sense leaving it in the bank

  enos did not look at a glance like
a man who was troubled by invest-
ments he was big and full-chested
about forty-five years old ruddy-faced
with a heavy growth of stubby un-
tamed black whiskers he wore a poor-
fitting suit of cheap dothes a soft
black hat unbrushed during enos own-
ership heavy shoes and a shirt with
a soft collar and yet no los an-

geles man would have been greatly sur-
prised by the figures written in his
bank book for enos was in the city
to which scotty brought his death val-
ley plunder the city in which oil der-
ricks sprouted overnight in more than
one back yard creating a new capitalist
out of a salaried suburbanite the dty
in fact in which getting rich quick was
too common an event to attract atten-
tion

  having made up his mind enos took
steps to invest his fortune wisely and
carefully these steps consisted in
looking at office windows until he saw
one with a gold-lettered sign reading
james b dunkhorn stocks bonds
investments

  i reckon said enos having read
this sign several times that hes the
feller i want to see

  whereupon he crossed the street and
placed himself and his bank account in
the hands of the most unscrupulous
broker and promoter in the city

  enos entered an outer office finding
a stenographer of radically blond pro-
clivities who took his name into an
inner sanctum and shortly ushered
him into the presence of james b
dunkhorn the broker was a tall thij
well-dressed young man with promi-
nent gold teeth the kind of man who
the element of chance



can be placed at a glance as a regular
reader of the sporting editions to
enos simple mind however this was
no drawback the mere fact that a man
had an office was proof enough to him
that he knew his business he ac-
cepted a proffered chair and stated his
business without preamble

  mr dunkhorn he said ive got
sixty-three thousand dollars in the
bank of commerce that i want to in-
vest so it will bring me a steady in-
come seeing the sign on your win-
dow i thought id drop in and talk it
over

  very wise indeed replied mr
dunkhorn modestly i have a good
list of safe investments-a very good
list

  im glad to hear that said enos
because im no judge of such things
myself so i have to rely on some one
else who has had experience

  mr dunkhorn reached down with
his left hand and pinched himself on
the leg he wanted to be perfectly
sure that he was wide awake

  may i ask if this sum represents a
sale of securities formerly held mr

-mr-

  whittaker said enos no i
never held securities whatever they
may be i got this money in the good
old-fashioned way of digging it out of
the ground i found it-thats the plain
fact there wasnt much digging to do
ah said mr dunkhorn a
mine

  something like that enos admit-
ted at any rate i got the gold out
of the ground now its turned into
cash and i want to make a good invest-
ment

  of course said mr dunkhorn
without apparent excitement have
you any choice mr whittaker
what do you mean

  railroad stocks-bank stocks-in-
dustrials-mortgages i would recom-

mend stocks bonds pay too low a rate
of interest to be attractive

  i ought to get a pretty fair inter-
est said enos doubtfully but i dont
know that ive got any choice bank
stocks ought to be good

  very good said mr dunkhorn
heartily possibly the very best form
of investment he leaned back in his
chair and pressed the tips of his fin-
gers together mr whittaker if you
are in no great hurry let me suggest
that you come in and see me to-mor-
row i have a very attractive propo-
sition here in the office-an unusually
attractive proposition our intention
was to keep the stock ourselves but it
is just possible that we may decide to
let in a few personal friends i
couldnt on my own responsibility un-
dertake to sell you any but i will see
the other directors to-night and bring
up the matter you see i want to do
the best i can for you and it happens
that this company just formed will
place any stock it may decide to sell
in my hands

  well now said enos gratefully
thats awful good of you what kind
of a company is it

  oil returned mr dunkhorn la-
conically let me tell you mr whit-
taker oil is the most valuable com-
modity in the world to-day not even
excepting gold we have twenty acres
of the best oil land in the state the
lady martha is on the adjoining prop-
erty-the heaviest gusher of them all
have you paid any attention to the price
of oil stocks mr whittaker

  not a bit

  last month said mr dunkhorn
the stocks of a dozen oil companies
were listed at around forty cents every
one of them is selling on th exchange
to-day at one dollar or over money
more than doubled in a month last
week the coyote oil companys stock
was quoted at one-sixty-five to-day


western story magazine

it is three-fifteen and i could tell you
of hundreds of just such instances

  enos was puzzled

  but how does a man get his interest
on the money he puts in he inquired

  dividends said mr dunkhorn
all of these stocks advance as the re-
sult of earning huge profits for their
holders the coyote company pays
eight per cent quarterly think of it-
thirty-two per cent on your money

  sounds pretty big said enos but
aint a man liable to lose

  to be frank about it the broker
admitted candidly there is an element
of chance that is to say in oil-stock
speculation of course this company
of ours is different we own the prop-
erty-we have the oil we are in the
oil business for legitimate purposes not
for speculation therefore each share
of our stock represents not only a full
dollars worth of value but a little more
than that if we offer any at all it will
be at par one dollar a share which
price we will raise to one-fifty at the
end of a month

  but why linger over the details
enos consented to postpone his invest-
ment for one day he was rewarded
by being given permission to buy sixty
thousand shares of the santa luisa oil
company for which he gave mr
dunkhorn his check for sixty thousand
dollars the broker showed his teeth
for a moment by trying to get the whole
sum but enos decided to keep three
thousand dollars for personal use

  during the following month he called
several times at the office usually find-
ing mr dunkhorn out at the end
of that time he called once more he
had begun to have a vague feeling of
uneasiness he had even found himself
wondering more than once if a man in
such a position could misrepresent stock
in order to sell it enos did not like
this feeling of doubt he dccided that
the moment the stock was advanced he
would sell out and put his money frito

something a trifle more widely known
than the santa luisa oil company

  mr dunkhorn was in this time and
received him kindly

  we had a directors meeting last
night mr whittaker he said and
voted not to put up the stock for an-
other week or so of course we are
not advertising it or trying to sell so
it makes no difference

  it makes some to me said enos
ive about made up my mind to sell
my stock mr dunkhorn and invest in
something else so i hoped youd de-
cided to advance it

  i would advise against selling now
said mr dunkhorn wait a few
weeks

  the feeling of distrust came over
enos again and he made a sudden deci-
sion

  i reckon ill sell he declared ill
sell back to you at the price i paid and
you can make the profit

  mr dunkhorn laughed involuntarily
he tried to make it appear a courteous
laugh and explained that it was not
possible for him to accept the kindly
offer it would ruin his professional
standing he said to take so base an
advantage of a client

  when enos got out on the street
again he took a deep breath

  i reckon id better investigate this
company he said to himself prob-
ably its all right and im a fool to be
scared but theres no harm in looking
over the ground

  in the course of a few days he
found that in return for his sixty thou-
sand dollars he was part owner of
twenty acres of bare mesa land worth
probably fifteen dollars an acre there
was not a sign of development on the
place not an oil derrick in sight

  he said the lady martha was on
the adjoining property enos remem-
bered well well so it is for that
matter so is the state of ohio they
all join sooner or later
the element of chance



  he went back to his hotel and sat
down in the lobby to think it over he
was not the kind of a man to waste
time in self-pity his effort was to ad-
just himself to the new conditions at
the end of an hour his mind was made
up

  probably i wouldnt have cared for
the life for no great time he said to
himself ill go back to prospecting
but i wish  had him out somewhere
in the open where i know how to
work

  the thought was pleasant moreover
it suggested others enos went to sleep
that night developing them

  for a few days he avoided mr dunk-
horns office then he made another
visit

  well he said affably when he got
inside hows the oil business getting
along

  everything looks good the broker
assured him to himself he added
its time to get out the old fathead
is going to be troublesome and then
again out loud yes mr whitta-
ker our prospects are better every day
in a few weeks now we will advance
the stock then if you wish i will
sell out for you

  i dont know as i care so much
about it any more said enos ive
about made up my mind to keep it till
weve been running a year or so by
then it ought to be worth two dollars

  easily said mr dunkhorn

  so it was about another matter i
came up to-day enos continued i
met an old friend of mine last night
and i got to talking to him about this
company now hes never had no
luck and hes only got a little money-
about a thousand dollars when i told
him about this stock going to one-fifty
in a short time he figured it out that
if he owned some he could make five
hundred dollars so hes been begging
me to get some for him and i thought

 i-w

id help him out by letting him have
a little of mine

  very generous of you said mr
dunkhorn but its not necessary i
can get that amount of treasury stock
for him if you prefer

  why of course said enos if you
can do that so much the better you
make it out to him heres his name
-robert h winters then ill pay
you and collect from him

  an even thousand shares mr
dunkhorn asked this was so easy that
it actually lacked interest

  i reckon said enos but just one
word first youre sure this company
is perfectly safe

  safe as the united states treasury
well thats all right then enos
continued its important with him
because this money is all hes got with
me of course it wouldnt make so much
difference because i could go out and
get more any time

  whats that asked mr dunkhorn
sharply

  out to the mine you know said
enos if i should happen to get hard
up i could go out there any time of
course and get more

  mr dunkhorn digested this state-
ment slowly he reached into a lower
drawer of his desk took out two ci-
gars and offered one to his visitor
how much more he asked

  oh lord said enos i dont
know i only took a small part
theres a whole lot left

  more than you brought in

  enos laughed

  i reckon he said considerable
more whats the difference im not
likely to want it i figured on getting
a few thousand a year out of my in-
vestment and living here where life is
enjoyable i worked a good many years
before i located that mine mr dunk-
horn and im tired of it but of
course its pleasant to have it there
it makes me feel secure


western story magazine

  but man alive the broker ex-
ploded some one else may stumble
on it

  it aint at all likely said enos
its in an out-of-the-way place there
aint many that go that way

  mr dunkhorns fingers tingled with
excitement

  my dear sir he protested you
are altogether too trusting too unused
to business methods if you will permit
me to say so the only sensible thing
for you to do is to work your mine
work it to the limit and put your money
where it will be safe

  oh  may do it some day said
enos theres no hurry now you
fix up that stock so i can get it to-mor-
row and ill come up for it

  sit down said mr dunkhorn
ill do it right now

  he busied himself for a time prepar-
ing the certificates when he had fin-
ished enos gave him a check for a
thousand dollars which he pocketed in
an abstracted manner as if his thoughts
were elsewhere

  now mr whittaker he said in
regard to your mine let me suggest
a plan realize all you can on it and
put the money in this oil stock you
and i could control the company and
mark up the price as we wished there
would be a fortune in it

  enos looked puzzled

  i thought there was no more for
sale he said

  i could manage it said the broker
leave that to me you go out and
get the gold and ill take care of the
stock proposition

  enos thought the matter over
no he said at length i reckon i
dont care to go back to mining just
yet maybe it will seem odd to you
but i aint ambitious to get no more
money than i need and i reckon ive
got enough for the present anyhow
he leaned back in his chair and smiled
complacently

  fathead said mr dunkhorn un-
der his breath serve him right if
some one finds his mine and steals it
if i decide i want more enos went
on ain t there some way i could get
up a company to handle it couldnt
i sell stock and have the work done so
 wouldnt have to go out myself
certainly said the broker thats
the only proper way to do it  could
handle the organization for you

  well now said enos that might
be a good idea id be willing to give
you a fair share for your work sup-
pose you run out there and see the
mine and then let me know what you
think would be the best way to handle
it

  mr dunkhorn smiled

  utterly unnecessary he said 
dont have to see a mine in order to
float stock in it in fact i couldnt tell
a mine from a cistern without expert
help

  oh well said enos in that case
well say no more about it i dont
want to be bothered myself and who-
ever handles it ought to know his busi-
ness maybe i can find some one
later

  mr dunkhorn was startled and
plainly grieved hitherto his experi-
ence with enos had been of a nature to
make him think he had only to sug-
gest a plan even to the writing of a
check to find it immediately adopted

  my dear mr whittaker he pro-
tested you misunderstood me when
it comes to organizing a company rais-
ing capital for a legitimate purpose like
yours or any such work i know how
to do it it is not necessary for me to
be an engineer in order to finance your
mine now lets get down to details
how much do you think we could get

out of it

  depends partly on luck andpartl
on how much work is done said
enos there ought to be close to half
a million
the element of chance



  the brokers eyes glistened he
thought rapidly here was the chance
for his big killing-the one he had been
waiting for his simple-minded client
would be clay in his expert hands
whatever gold came from the mine
could be directed into the right chan-
nels the possibilities in the way of
heavy capitalization were enormous

  mr whittaker he said ill go
out with you and look over the prop-
erty

  not with me said enos i dont
care about going but i can tell you
how to get there you take the train
for yuma locate the new palace ho-
tel and ask the clerk for bob hell
take you out

  bob who asked the broker

  there aint no who to it said
enos his name is bob the clerk
will know who you mean and find him
for you ill write bob a letter so hell
know what to do

  the prospect of a trip to the desert
was not alluring but mr dunkhorn
had more than once accepted the chance
of a visit to a much hotter place for a
far smaller sum than half a million
it was not the time for hesitation

  all right he said tu go in the
morning

ii

  in the san bernardino mountains
north of yuma the sun always a steady
worker was devoting itself enthusias-
tically to business the bleak slopes
radiated heat the rocks that jutted out
everywhere were blistering to the touch

  up one of these slopes there toiled
and sweated two patient burros one
patient man and one maniac the pa-
tient man was bob the maniac was
james b dunkhorn never in his life
had the broker so regretted an act as
he now regretted this move to a man
whose exercise had been confined to
poker and three-cushion billiards for
ten years struggling up forty-five-de-

gree mountainsides in a temperature of
one hundred and ten in the shade with
no shade in sight was to put it mildly
strenuous it galled him all the more
to think that it was utterly useless un-
dertaken merely to avoid giving offense
to enos whittaker as far as inspect-
ing the mine was concerned his inten-
tion was merely to reach it turn around
and go home where he would report
favorably and advise immediate capi-
talization for two million dollars

  on this particular day the fourth of
his travels with bob and the burros he
was almost beside himself with rage
and fatigue every hundred yards he
stopped for a drink gasping for breath
as he tilted the huge canteen

  at the end of an unusually severe
struggle which made even the burros
pant for breath he staggered over to
his guide and held out his hand too
weak to voice his desire

  want water asked bob

  the brokers remaining temper
cracked suddenly and broke

  you crazy fool he uttered thickly
of course i want water for gods
sake dont stand there and grin un-
fasten the canteen and give it to me
sorry said bob there aint no
more water

  for a moment dunkhorn did not
grasp his meaning

  the canteen man he repeated
quick

  its empty said bob and its the
last one

  the brokers knees weakened he
sat down on the ground

  you been usin too much bob
went on i told you so you cant
carry water out here to pour all over
yourself whenever you get a little warm
when you got through last time there
wasnt more than a pint left

where is it demanded dunkhorn
i drank it said bob placidly i
aint no hog but i got to have a drop
now and then or my throttle shuts up


western story magazine

i ligger a pint out of three gallons aint
no more than my fair share

  dunkhorn started at him then broke
into hideous curses he rolled over on
the ground and beat it with his lists
he cursed bob himself enos whitta-
ker and the mine including the burros
in a final summary

  bob watched him curiously

  that aint no wise way to behave
partner he protested mildly  rec-
ommend that you try to keep cool
the broker gave one short hard
laugh and sat up

  what are we going to do he
asked

  ovv thats more like sense bob
approved we aint so turrible bad
off the mine is just around that
cliff

  is there water there

  again bob looked at him curiously
do you reckon i would come out
here with only water enough for one
way he asked sure theres some
at the mine rest a spell and well
make it in half an hour

  i dont want rest said dunkhorn
getting to his feet i want water-
water-a tub of it i want to fall into
a lake and drink it dry hurry man
-hurry

there aint no take at the mine
said bob but theres plenty to drink
they toiled on slowly for in spite
of his mad craving dunkhorn was too
weak to make speed

  at length after what seemed to the
broker an age of agony they came to
a level spot walled in except on the
side by which they had ascended by
perpendicular cliffs in the face of the
cliff was an opening shaded like a
church door arched at the top bob
pointed to it

  thats enos mine he said

  the water said dunkhorn pite-
ously he had lost all thought of gold
the water-where is it

  its inside said bob

  he led the way lighting a candle
which he held over his head dunk-
horn followed him along a narrow
passage for a hundred leet then
through a wider one branching off at
right angles lor twice the distance at
the end of the passage the flaring can-
dle showed the figure of a man seated
on a huge boulder

  in spite of his extremity the broker
felt a thrill of superstitious fear he
stood still while bob went forward
and fastened his candle to the wall

  howdy enos he said heres
your young friend dry as a salt mack-
erel accordin to schedule

  dunkhorn sprang forward

  water he begged

  enos reached back for a canteen
poured water into a tin cup and handed
it to him the broker swallowed it at
a gulp

  sit down said enos ive got a
business proposition i want you to fig-
ure on mr dunkhorn

  first said the broker fill the cup
again and give it to me

  enos did so

  one more said dunkhorn

  not now enos insisted its bad
for you to drink too much at once
rest a minute while i talk to bob

  he turned to the guide who was
drinking copiously from the canteen

  bob he said handing him an en-
velope heres the stock i bought for
you-one thousand shares of the santa
luisa oil company i paid one dol-
lar a share as i explained you ought
to sell em at one-fifty mr dunkhorn
here considers em worth that

  muck obliged to you enos said
bob ill buy me that blue-skinned
jackass i been lookin at hes a good
animal

  enos turned to the broker

  are you ready to listen to my prop-
osition he asked

  not now said dunkhorn he had
recovered himself to a certain extent
the element of chance



i dont like to be annoying mr whit-
taker but i must have another drink
thats what i was going to talk
about said enos the way i look
at it mr dunkhorn water is the most
valuable commodity in the world co-day
not even excepting oil i cant afford
to give mine away im going to cap-
italize it and sell it

  out of the terrible heat and with
his thirst at least partly satisfied dunk-
horn felt his nerve coming back at
the first recognition of enos he had
known instinctively that the miner was
out for retribution but after all enos
was hardly the man to plan murder
and there seemed to be little that he
could do the broker had less than a
hundred dollars in his pockets

  id like to buy a dollars worth right
now he said genially

  enos ignored the pleasantry

  theres a question id like to ask
you mr dunkhorn he said take
the case of a man whos worked hard
for his money when you sell him
stock like you sold me lying about it
from start to finish dont it bother you
none to think about what hes going to
do

  i am not in a position to resent
that said dunkhorn easily so i will
merely explain that i dont lie about my
business and have nothing to fear
enos laughed gently

  did you tell me that the lady mar-
tha was on the property adjoining
ours he demanded

  the broker was silent

  did you tell me that there was what
you called an element of chance in oil
stocks 

  i did said dunkhorn thats not
a lie i was perfectly frank about it
where was the chancer enos
asked for me i mean what
chance did i have to get back a cent of
my money

  again the broker declined to answer

  well said enos well drop that
it aint important now i just wanted
to make it clear why im organizing my
water company mr dunkhorn i own
all the water at this place it comes
from a spring but you could hunt a
hundred years without finding it so
unless you get it from me i reckon
youll have to go without ill sell you
a third interest in my water for sixty-
one thousand five hundred dollars that
will square me for my oil stock which
i will throw in free on the deal and
give bob five hundred dollars for help-
ing to promote the company you see
ive been studying up on this organiz-
ing business

  dunkhorn laughed easily

  i dont care to buy he said

  enos got up

  well bob i reckon well be going
he said mr dunkhorn i leave you
the mine this dont happen to be the
one where i got my gold by the way
but if you find any here its yours

  just a minute said dunkhorn he
turned to his guide you are in my
employ he said not whittakers
my instructions are for you to stay
here with me

  i dont aim to mix in no hostili-
ties bob declared frankly i
wouldnt have guided you around the
block if enos hadnt wrote me a let-
ter you and him can argue out your
troubles but what enos says goes with
me

  all right said dunkhorn he had
been bluffing trying to appear anxious
to get out of his predicament but it
was hard for him to repress a smile
it was going to be absurdly easy after
all payment on a check could be
stopped by wire from yuma a fact of
which the simple-minded miners appa-
rently were not aware all right 
he said youve got me whittaker
ill quit squealing and admit that im
beaten

  he took a check book and fountain
iu

western story magazine

pen from his pocket and wrote a check

for the amount enos had named

  there he said now give me
another drink

  enos handed him the canteen and
examined the check carefully

  have you got that much money in
the bank he asked

  certainly said the broker

   didnt know but what you might
have spent some of it said enos
you want to be sure because if they
dont cash this youll be in kind of a
hard place

  what do you mean dunkhorn de-
manded

  why said enos of course youll
have to wait here until i get the money
i like a safe business i dont care about
that element of chance so i aint plan-
ning to run any if theycash this ill
send word out to bob and hell bring
you in if they dont cash it hell go
in by himself and you can do whatever
seems best to you

dunkhorn was unable to conceal his
chagrin enos looked at him critically

i reckon ill take a chance with it
he decided im going to go up to the

office and give my oil stock to that yel-
low-haired typewriter of yours and tell

her you bought it back im not posted
on the law but if it was all right for
you to sell it to me there hadnt ought
to be no hitch about me selling it back
make yourself comfortable mr dunk-
horn bob ill get word out to you in
less than two weeks

  within the time set by enos a veteran
of the mountains appeared at the mine
with a note bob read it and hastened
to impart its contents to his guest

  enos says he got the money he
announced

  well saidl dunkhorn sullenly
when do we start

  come over here said bob he
took him by the arm and led him to a
pinnacle from which the surrounding
country could be seen do you make
out that rocky peak asked bob point-
ing to it right around the other side
of that is a town you can go from
there by stage to yuma and save walk-
ing i recommend that you do it be-
cause im aiming to take it easy on the
return trip this man lives there and
hell show you the way

sioux indians organize temperance society

there has recently been reported from the fort totten reservation near
 devils lake north dakota where the sioux indians are stationed the

younger indians and those older ones who still think they need hre water to ge

on the volstead wagon	

     one of the first acts of the society was to call upon i olice chief  eter i in bo 
of devils lake and ask his cooperation it is said that many of the
sioux braves when they drive into devils lake have been in the habltbuf
lemon and vanilla extract canned heat and other things containing a o  
older indians requested the police chief to use his mfluence to	of the r

merchants in the city from selling these products to the other

it has been suggested to us that the rea-
son for this is that persons step a little
bit shorter with one leg than with the
other and that unless they keep their

eyes fixed on a point <_>f destination they
they are bound to keep turning either
to the right or to the left as they
go forward we tried this the other
day in a pasture lot we blindfolded a
half dozen persons and told them to
walk as straight as they could to a given
point having first let them select this
point before putting on the blindfold
not any of the six were able to come
within striking distance of the mark
that they had selected all bearing either
to the right or to the left of it to a con-
siderable degree have you any sug-
gestions to offer

jo jin north

    it is our aim in this department to be of genuine practical help and service to those
who vish to make use of it dont hesitate to write to us and give us the opportunity
of assisting you to the best of our ability

   address all communications to john north care of western story maga-
zine  seventh avenue new york n y

douglas wyoming and vicinity

a great many persons write me
asking which part of the west
they ought to settle in as if
i could tell them that in such cases
i tell them to follow up this department
and other sources of information about
the west until they come across some
description that strikes them as offer-
ing what they desire it is for the bene-
fit of such readers whose ideas are only
half formed or perhaps only quarter
formed that i publish a brief sketch
each week of some particular locality
or some special phase of western life
thus those who think thatthey have
found what they are seeking can write
for additional information

  last week i had something to say
about dry farming in converse county
wyoming and suggested certain aspects
of this work that might interest an
agriculturist of small capital seeking new
fields the country around douglas
the county seat of converse county has

a substantial prosperity based on live
stock wool growing and oil

  there is nothing to suggest the fron-
tier days about douglas except when
the state fair a big annual event is
in progress the public buildings and
homes of this city would be considered
worthy of a place in any community
the former include several schools and
churches a federal building a court-
house the city hall and the public li-
brary

  the following is a statement given out
by the local commercial club as to the
opportunities douglas offers the capi-
talist  and from this one can get an idea
as to the lines along which things are
likely to develop for the worker in the
next few years

  douglas needs woolen mills being
located in the heart of the best wool-
producing territory in the united
states we offer a most excellent location
for this industry a good brick and
where to go and how to get there



tile works could find a very profitable
location here as we have good raw ma-
terial for both and a coal mine only
one mile away a good flour mill will
find an unusual opportunity here being
located in a section where the finest
grade of milling wheat is raised a
canning factory could not find a better
location for no better flavored sweet
corn peas beans beets and cabbage
are raised anywhere we also raise won-
derful cucumbers and a starch factory
for the large yields of potatoes would
be a good investment

  of course as most persons know it
is the tendency of chambers of com-
merce and commercial clubs to talk in
superlatives and to refer to their own
particular corner of the country as the
land of opportunity for the newcomer
so much depends on the said newcomer
himself on his capability on his will-
ingness to work on his health and men-
tality and staying powers that it is hard
to tell where to place the blame in the
event of failure the one way to form
an opinion is to pay a visit to the place
in which you contemplate settling and
live there a while studying conditions
for yourself and forming your own
judgment as to how you will make out
this is worth more than all the advice
and suggestion that all the chambers of
commerce and john norths can hand
out in a million years

a range riders reminis-
cences

  my dear north  i am no writer but as
you kindly suggested in your issue of july
ist that your readers would like to hear
from me again here goes

  no class of men have been so misunder-
stood as the american cowboys that they
were wild in the extreme goes without argu-
ment usually lean wiry bronzed men they
were legs generally cased in leather chaps
and high-heeled boots sitting a loose
slouchy seat in the saddle yet the best rough
riders the world ever did or ever will pro-
duce their most distinguishing trait was
absolute fidelity should they like their em-
ployer well enough to take his pay and eat

the grub furnished the employer could ex-
cept in rare instances rely on them yet if
they got the least idea of being misused
the guilty one would in all probability be
glancing down the muzzle of a  colt
with some rapid explanation another char-
acteristic trait was their respect for wom-
anhood i never knew a real cow-puncher
to insult a woman and i dont believe one
ever did rain or shine hot or cold all
was passed as a jest perhaps after rid-
ing down three or four horses during the
day the cowboy would take his relief period
of two hours with a restless herd of beef
singing to lull them to sleep and just as
ready to spur his plunging mount in the lead
of a frenzied stampede with no thought for
his own safety in his anxiety to save the
herd from destruction it was mans work
this life on the range

  of course there were exceptions riders
with shady records could be found during
the period that the writer rode the purple
sage butch cassidy jack flagg and
ben carter were three such characters i
saw the former and rode with the latter
two it was on sand creek a tributary
of the sweetwater that i witnessed young
jim jeffreys shot to death lying on his
blankets by bei carter jeffreys was a
happy light-hearted boy who never in any
way offended any one carter made his es-
cape in the excitement on the only horse
in camp but was captured at devils gate
the following morning at the hub and
spoke ranch he was tried the following
spring found guilty of murder in the first
degree atid his neck was stretched by sher-
iff william high flagg was shot and
killed from ambush during the rustler war
in the eighties butch cassidy leader of
the famous hole-in-the-wall gang made
his escape i believe to south america

  we read the western story magazine
regularly from cover to cover i found
through its pages an old rider of the same
days as myself mr james henderson of
new york city and found him to be ac-
quainted with many of my old pardners of
the frontier	frank o filbey

  south haven mich

  one point on which t disagree with
this correspondent is his opening state-
ment that he is no writer i think he
is a mighty entertaining writer and
im sure my readers will agree with
me many thanks for this interesting
little bit of reminiscence
   miss louise rice who conducts this department will see to it that you will be
able to make friends with other readers though thousands of miles may separate you
it must be understood that miss rice will undertake to exchange letters only be-
tween men and men boys and boys women and women girls and girls letters
will be forwarded direct when correspondents so wish otherwise they will be an-
swered here be sure to inclose forwarding postage when sending letters through the
hollow tree

some of the gang continue to
wonder why they dont see their
letters in the tree within a week
of writing them please listen there-
fore and paste this somewhere where
you can see it write the tree at least
two months before you want to see your
letter published and then allow some
time over that in case there has been
an extra lot in the old holla just at that
time remember this magazine is
printed eight weeks ahead of the time
that it reaches you and the postmistress
has to have time to sort your letters be-
fore she reads em out there thats
that

  heres just piles and piles of letters
from the gang as usual so we will
plunge right in and take em as they
come

  member the texas kid heres a
note from him

  hello dear friend when i wrote to
you some time ago i did not really believe
that you and the hollow tree would go to
the trouble of recognizing a letter of an old
has-been of the ranches but i am more than
surprised-i am pleased-to say that i have
received a number of responses i do ap-
preciate this and want others also being

lonely since i lost my pal and buddy in the
big scrap in 

  with best wishes to you partner and the
rest of the gang i am

the texas kid

  dear miss rice  i see that a great many
young fellows want a place to work in the
west and regret that they have no way of
learning the business tell them for me
that if they want work let them learn how
to run tractors and care for them

  this brother gave information of this
sort to a young man who wanted a
chance to go west and said so around
the old tree and it seemed so good a
bit that we are herewith reading it out
for the benefit of many others of the
gang

  dear miss rice  i have wanted to write
the old tree for quite a while but hesitated
then seeing that there were plenty of folks
writing in i thought i would have a try
 am a real westerner born and raised on
a ranch i have tried he cities a few times
but was always glad to get back i have
not been riding for some time on account
of getting crippled up but i expect to use
the old chaps and spurs again just now 
am working in a dairy about three miles
the hollow tree



from a mining camp one of the largest in
the southwest i will be glad to send in-
formation of this part of the country to any
of the gang new mexico sam

  dear miss rice heres hoping that the
w s m will always be with us and that
the gang will spread and spread every-
where i have lived most of my life in the
open have punched cattle in argentina been
over nearly all of south america in africa
for three years and served in france two
years-thats me	richard snyder

tractive button enameled in colors
with the words hollow tree gang
w s m 

the buttons are supplied to readers at
cost-twenty-five cents which includes
mailing charges

for men and boys the button has been
made so that it can be worn on the
coat lapel for women and girls the
design is exactly the same only it is
on a pin state which you want

  remittances for the button should be
  sent to the hollow tree western
  story magazine  seventh avenue
  new york city

  dear miss rice may a railroader join
the gang this one would like to i have
read the w s m for years but this is the first
time  have written the tree i hope that
it isnt shunted off into storage i am a
young locomotive fireman on the illinois cen-
tral railroad indiana division i have been
firing for three years would like to hear
from any of the gang robert la rue

   fulton avenue evansville ind

  dear miss rice i used to lay in my hunk
down in a submarine and read the w s m
and every time we were where there was a
news stand getatable i would see if i could
buy all the latest numbers i was sta-
tioned in panama for fifteen months and
there i never missed an issue i certainly
enjoved ronicky doone

  in the hollow tree quite a while ago i

noticcd that the oakland kid would send
any of the gang cowboy songs i am from
oklahoma and maybe i know a few of them
but i would like to hear from him about
those he has i shall soon be on my way
to california but i suppose mail will reach
me so long as a man has eyes to see
and a brain that wants to know  figure
theyre things hes bound to miss if he
doesnt come and go theres always a place
beyond that place where i happen to hang
my hat and another place beyond that place
and a world beyond all that

  will the oakland kid please take
notice and wrrite this brother

  before we go on heres one of those
unusual requests that the old owl thinks
is all right to be put in the tree a
man of good character who has a good
trade and works at it all the time who
is fifty-three wants to find some fam-
ily where he will be taken in not only
as a paying guest which he will be but
also as really part of the family it is
not an ordinary boarding place that he
wants but a home where he can put
in his interests with the family and
feel that he is one as if for instance
he were an uncle his name is a nor-
ton tobey and the address is no 
delaware avenue bartlesville okla-
homa anybody who feels that they
have a place for this man somewhere
near his present address ought to write
him and see how close a bond of sym-
pathy of tastes there is

  dear miss rice i want something that

i	am sure i will find in the gang and this
is it-i want a partner i want a man to
travel with me on a western trip by way of
the lincoln highway he doesnt have to
have a lot of money if he is of the rjht
sort i have a machine and all i want is
a pal who will be a real pal i want to
travel to washington state and back by
some other route home i was raised out
in oklahoma and know what i am about
thanking you miss rice and all the gang
and hoping to get the boy i am after i am
