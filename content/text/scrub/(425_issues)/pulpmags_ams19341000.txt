type and printing

 by t oconor sloane phd

just as the early manuscripts may
be safely pronounced superior to
those of the present day the early
type are so attractive that some of the
best examples of printing go back to the
sixteenth century

  the elzevirs who produced a great
many small sized books  mos we
would call them now as well as larger
ones used a type with little shading
in the letter and which for its size was
probably one of the easiest to read
and was most saving to the eyes of
the readers the name as applied to
type still persists and a period of decay
which is imputed to typography was sal-
vaged to a certain extent by such print-
ers as these any number of type faces
have been drawn and to-day we find the
word caslon used to designate a slight-
ly antique class of letters which are
used in great quantity for everyday

work it is due to william caslon he
was born in  and died in  he
was recognized as the greatest type de-
signer and type-founder of his day the
earliest example of his printing type
in book form is in the library of the
american antiquarian society wor-
cester mass some of his old forms
and matrices for type are preserved in
england his type was abandoned for
a while but was revived in  and is
now used very extensively

  one interesting thing which may have
led to type-printing were initial letters
engraved on wooden blocks the body
of a book might be written leaving
blank spaces for ornamental initials and
these were often printed in from what
were really type otherwise the manu-
script would have depended on profes-
sional illuminators to do the initials by
hand
type and printing



  the mazarin bible of  is a beau-
tiful piece of printing-so regular and
true to line and width of column that it
must have been the work of a man ex-
perienced for years in printing from
type this work the vulgate bible is
a monument of perfection and its date
is thirty-six years ahead of the year of
columbus crossing of the atlantic the
point to be made is that we are absolutely
ignorant of the genius who invented and
developed the making of type there is
every probability that it was kept a pro-
found secret for what we may term good
business reasons

  it was not far from the days of the
elzevirs that italic type faces were in-
vented and numbers of books were
printed in that type a peculiarity of
the italic type is that it seems of a
lighter tint than the regular type with
which we are so familiar although
printed with exactly the same ink it
originated in italy with a printer named
aldus minutius in venice

  probably few people have an idea of
what a complicated thing a type is
within recent years there have been rev-
olutionary changes in printing in one
class of machines a line of type is set up
in one single piece the well known lino-
type machine does this and it is fair to
say that most of the printing is done on
linotype machines then there are
other machines which make and set up
their type all in one operation one way
of operating these involves the use of per-
forated paper which is perforated on a
machine different holes giving different
letters but if we go back to the old-
fashioned type of which there is constant
use made and which will always be used
in some classes of work we find that it
is a curiously complicated production

  the illustration shows a modern type
and the principal parts are indicated by
numbers and the description tells what

each part is yet even what is shown
here indicating some ten principal parts
is incomplete as there are two or three
others which can be named thus we may
be sure that few people know what a serif
is it is the fine horizontal or inclined
line at the top or bottom of some letters
there are generally two of them one
pointing to the left and the other to the
right there may be several serifs on a
single letter it is interesting to go
through the description of others of these
numbered parts sometimes letters have
no serifs and these types can be recog-
nized in display type very often

  it is absolutely essential that each type
should sit firmly on its base it will be
seen that there is a groove crossing the
bottom of the type this gives it two feet
to be supported on so that there will be
no central irregularity to cause it to
rock the grooves on its sides are called
nicks this enables the typesetter to
know by the feel whether he is setting
the type right-side up or not by feeling
for the nick other nicks tell him per-
haps what font he is working with

  very large books containing millions
of letters have been set up from such type
as are illustrated each one to be right-
side-up in its proper place and spacing
has to be introduced by putting little bars
of type metal called quads between the
words in the older works of printers
and copyists it will be found that very
little use was made of spacing putting
quads between letters of a word is bad
practise

  we are told that as a rule heat ex-
pands and cold contracts anything solid
liquid or gaseous which is subjected to
its action in water we have a curious
exception to this rule for if we cool
water it will become smaller and smaller
up to a certain point about twelve degrees
f above the freezing point when it has
reached this temperature it is at its
greatest density and as it cools still


amazing stories

further it expands a little when the
point of freezing is reached a sudden
change takes place the water becomes
ice and in doing this it expands nearly
ten per cent as it forms ice it develops
an enormous pressure if an attempt is
made to confine it an object cast from
water in a mold would fill the mold com-
pletely and possibly would burst it due to
this expansion

  type is made from an alloy of lead and
antimony this alloy acts in solidifying
like water any object cast with it if
it does not strain or break the mold
will give a perfect reproduction ac-
cordingly this alloy represents essentially
what is known as type metal other
metals are sometimes alloyed with the
lead and antimony it follows that if the
mold is accurate the type metal filling it
and expanding slightly will give a perfect
type at least as far as its face and sides
are concerned the foot will need ma-
chining or planing to finish it

  the material for paper up to about the
year  was virtually nothing but rags
as the material which was waste fabrics
was called this had to be cleaned with
the greatest care and all foreign sub-
stances removed with scrupulous exact-
ness but the demand for paper began
to increase and more and more paper was
wanted a product called esparto was
imported from spain and this was an
excellent material for addition to the
rags it was a sort of grass and we feel
that there should be a chance of utilizing
other grasses for paper making the
forests are now being cut down and de-
pleted to supply wood pulp as the material
for paper the depletion of the forests
for paper is put at five per cent of the
total consumption of wood on this con-
tinent wood provides a comparatively
pure cellulose the wood is ground up
by a species of mill or it is attacked by
chemicals so as to break it down and get
it into the form of fine cellulose pulp it

appears therefore that about the year
 what we may term revolutionary
changes in the manufacture of paper as
regards its material began to take place
and this has led to a curious investigation
that may have quite serious results from
the standpoint of money

  previous to  going back perhaps
twelve or fifteen years from that date
early editions of the works of celebrated
authors were supposed to have been pub-
lished there is a great fad for collecting
old books and their value is followed up
by collectors studying the different re-
ports from auction rooms and the prices
are constantly advancing there are not
very many of these books and that may
have been what started the investigation
it was found that in many cases the paper
was not pure rag paper that wood pulp
could be found in it by chemical exam-
ination this discovery was supplemented
by the study of the faces of the type
these were found to have a modern touch
about them which indicated that they
were not made prior to a comparatively
recent date

  the collectors of old and rare books
book lovers or bibliophiles had attended
the auction sales and purchased these al-
leged rare books but a recent investi-
gation based partly on the type face and
partly on the chemical or microscopic ex-
amination of the paper was claimed to
have brought out the fact that a quantity
of counterfeit reproductions of rare old
books was carried on in england with
great success years later than  many
books otherwise of ordinary or no real
value were purchased at extravagant fig-
ures by collectors and now presumably
some of these books are worth nothing

  there is however a way to get out
of it sometimes an artist will have a
follower who will paint practically as well
as he and who can copy all his manner-
isms this was done with the painter
corot and the falsified pictures in some
type and printing



cases even when known to be false bring
high prices there is a possibility if all
these books we have referred to as ob-
jects of the collecting propensity are
known to be counterfeits that they may
acquire a special value so that their own-
er can be reimbursed to a considerable
extent if he has paid high prices for sup-
posed originals that is to say the prices
of real originals of these books like
the corot reproductions of paintings
these reproductions of printings may
eventually bring very good prices though
known to be counterfeit and their pos-
sessors may recoup part of their loss

  quite long books have been written
on the subject of printing and type so as
a supplement to this article exemplifying
how much of interest there is in the sub-
ject we give an illustration of a type with
letters to indicate some of the parts as
described in the accompanying text

  a is the shank which is the rectangular
prism of type-metal which supports the
face its special function is to provide
a rigid resistance to the compression
which it is subjected to when it is locked
in position in the lock-up b is the
face of the type c is the shoulder the
flat upper surface of the shank complete-
ly exposed d is the beard e is supposed
to indicate two serifs little projections
to the right or left at top or bottom of
the letter often type have no serifs

they are called sans-serifs the arrows
should have been a little more spread in
the diagram f is the stem the vertical
stroke of such letters as the one shown
widening a little at the base or beard d
g shows serifs at the foot of the letter
h is the nick it varies in different fonts
some fonts having as many as four nicks
to distinguish them the nicks also are
to be felt by the fingers of the composi-
tor so that he will be sure to set the
type right side up i is the groove and jj
are the feet which ensure the true sup-
port the waistline is determined by
the tops of such letters as a m n and
others ignoring the slight rise of round
letters such as o and c above the waist-
line the base line is the line of the foot
of the letter in a type ascenders are
such letters as d and f which extend
above the waist-ine descenders are
letters going below the base line such
as g j and p the kern is the part of the
face which sometimes projects beyond
the shank  and j are the most frequently
kerned letters some printers consider
kerns a nuisance a ligature is where
two letters are practically on one shank
this may sometimes be seen in f fol-
lowed by i the latter coming directly
under the top of 

  it is fair to say that many pages have
been written on this subject by those
who were true devotees of the art


amazing stories

the pool of life

by p schuyler miller

this story deserves to be characterized as very individual almost unique
there is a mixture of the everyday world and of a strange world of mystery
the whole is carried out to an end which brings it all into unity we feel
that p schuyler miller has produced an unusual narration

chapter i

the man on the train

the man in the seat ahead of
me bought an extra at ben-
nington in vermont the
newsboys were making a big
fuss over it but they do that
over things as unimportant as a merger
of local cheese-merchants i distrust
extras

  the fellow ahead looked like the sort
who always buys them if only to see
what horse came in at saratoga he was
obviously from the city-new york
probably-for he had been there when
i got on at albany for all that i liked
his looks then he raised the paper a
little higher and i came up standing
with a yell that woke the whole car

  big red headlines sprawled across the
page

granby massacre village wiped out

i

  i snatched the paper out of his hands
granby was my village-my home town
i was bound there for my cousins wed-
ding and now-this

granby massacre village wiped on
nude maniacs slaughter villagers on
lying farms razed

  rutland aug -william cooney
an employee of the rutland post-office
this morning made a discovery that has
horrified the entire state delivering mail
to the smaller towns east of rutland
he found the village of granby a mass
of smoking ruins its streets littered with
the horribly mutilated bodies of its three
hundred inhabitants returning immed-
iately to the nearest town hawford he
notified the local authorities and tele-
phoned to rutland

  a posse from hawford found the
entire population of granby and of the
neighboring farms slain among the
ruins of the town a pitched battle had
been fought in the streets between the
half-clad villagers and their fiendish
assailants the bodies of the dead were
hideously mangled by jagged instruments
and their scalps torn from their heads
men women and children alike were
destroyed in the mad frenzy of the
killers

  no survivor exists in granby or the
outlying farms to describe the attack


one lay dead at my jeet and i saw hewitts gun come smashing down to
split the skull of his second victim like a ripe melon prentiss let go three
shots that brought three of the dazzled creatures crumpling to the ground


amazing stories

the sole clue to the nature oi the slay-
ers lies in three naked bodies found
among the smoking ruins of the village
church in which women and children
had gathered for protection badly
charred by the flames these bodies have
been pronounced those of microcephalic
idiots of an extraordinary type who
may have escaped with other maniacs
from a private asylum and attacked the
villagers in an insane fear of capture
police officials are investigating this pos-
sibility

people were crowding around me
pointing asking questions the man
ahead had turned in his seat and was
trying to make himself heard then
someone came elbowing down the aisle
and took me by the arm

  come on he said into my ear lets
get out of this we have to talk

  he led me back into the smoking car
i noticed that the young fellow from
the seat ahead had followed us he
closed the door behind him and stood
with his back against it staring at us i
for my part was looking at the man
who had brought me here-a square-
jawed blonde hercules with keen gray
eyes behind gold-rimmed glasses and
blunt-fingered powerful hands he
seemed to be about my own age

  the man from the seat ahead spoke
first we had instinctively waited for
him he was wiry and dynamic the sort
who always speaks first

  im ted hewitt he announced re-
porting this thing for theworld whore
you and what do you know about it
the other man answered for me
this i imagine is dr john cady
whose family has lived in and near
granby for a good many years i am
howard prentiss

  i was to marry his cousin dorcas
to-morrow

chapter ii

the granby massacre

it was two hours before that creeping
train reached rutland we came to
know each other pretty well by
then we were united by a common
bond-granby and the thing that had
happened there two of us had a great-
er grimmer bond dorcas cady had
lived high against the mountain above
granby she was my cousin and she was
to have been his wife

  i had never met howard prentiss-
never chanced to be there when he was
he was professor of anthropology in
some small eastern college that still stuck
to the old liberal arts curriculum he had
more of a name than most in his position
i could see that the reporter hewitt
recognized it there were not many men
who knew more about the early races of
man here and abroad dorcas had met
him as a student then later when he
came to granby to investigate a find
that a local collector had made he
stayed for the duration of his vacation
and longer and i had been on my way
to their wedding

  his face was expressionless now as
he questioned the reporter but his hands
were white-knuckled where he grasped
the arms of his seat i knew what he
felt

  hewitt he said in his low clear
voice you know more about what has
happened than we do you will have
seen the confidential press reports and
are here to confirm them for your
paper tell us

  hewitt hesitated the ethics of a
scoop are pretty rigid what he saw in
our faces decided him

 i dont know much he replied
slowly this man cooney was on the
mail truck a new man to the route and
he got there rather late granby is pretty
well down in the hills and what he saw
the pool of life



first was a farm up on the mountain
burned to the ground and still smoulder-
ing then there was another closer to
the road and he could see bodies lying
in the yard he stepped on the gas then
and when he got to granby he found
what the paper says it was wiped out
every being dead-cut to pieces-even
the animals and the town set afire it
must have happened in the night some
time because they were mostly half
dressed as if they ran out into the street
and were chopped down when they
opened the door this maniac angle is
new but it sounds likely do you know
of any asylum up in there

  prentiss shook his head there is
none hewitt he said quietly that
was a newspaper-mans guess i have
been all through that country with
dorcas and with other men who have
lived all their lives there i know every
bam and back road within twenty miles
of granby there is no insane asylum
in there

  hewitt was plainly puzzled but
where could they come from he de-
manded it was the coroner said they
were lunatics hes a doctor he ought
to know isnt there some place where
they could be hidden-in a cave or some-
thing there are caves up in there

  you dont know vermont prentiss
told him no one could hide a thing
like that not even in a cave lunatics
have to be fed like anyone else do you
realize how many there must have been
three hundred people were cut down
by sheer brute force and weight of num-
bers it was no ambush there was time
to get the women and children into the
church and surround it it was war-
frontier war-of a kind that vermont
has not seen for three hundred years
there must have been hundreds of them
mad with blood lust utterly careless of
death or injury an asylum that could
house that many would be known all over

the state-all over this part of the
country it would have to be the
authorities would see to it

  but-good lord protested hewitt
it happened whether it could or not
it did they found three of them-idiots
microcephaiics they call them they had
to come from somewhere

prentiss nodded slowly they
came from somewhere-yes but they
came from no asylum there is more
than escape from an asylum behind this
you know hewitt microcephaiics are
not the sort of creatures that would do
this thing you must have seen them in
circus side-shows as pin-heads if you
harm them of course they will fight back
as animals do but they could never have
done this thing there is something
more behind this massacre-something
terrible perhaps this is only the be-
ginning

  it was not long before we knew how-
right he was in rutland we hired a car
we found the roads picketed a cordon
of troops thrown around granby watch-
ing the roads and hill-tops heliographs
were flickering from the mountains
something-no man knew what-had
struck and vanished somewhere in that
guarded area the killers must be lurking
they would not escape

  hewitt got through on his reporters
card and prentiss and i as relatives of
the dead we were known to most
people in the granby region their faces
told us what we had dreaded the cady
farm had not escaped

  six hours after william cooney had
driven down into the granby valley
smoke was still hovering heavily over
the fields and rising in thick sluggish
columns from the hillsides where farms
had been a line of licking flame was
creeping up over the mountain where
the woods had caught we could see
the wavering black line that showed


amazing stories

where men were fighting the fire back

  prentiss touched my arm always
when i came down around this curve in
the road i would look up and see the
white farmhouse and red barns of the
cady place nestling under the great
elms high up on the flank of the moun-
tain above granby the elms were seared
and yellow and beneath them an ugly
black stain lay on the green hillside
black dots that were people were com-
ing slowly down the old hill-road be-
hind a covered truck

  there is nothing that we can do
there he said dully i prefer not to
go up for the present what i can do
will be below in the village where the
bodies were found will you wait for
me

  he was right a week or a day ago
we would have been bumping up that
winding road in high watching at every
turn for dorcas or one of the young-
sters they loved to come down the hill
to meet us-to ambush us on one of
the wooded bends and ride triumphantly
with us to the house now that hillside
was bleak and bare all beauty gone
from it there would be blackened
horror in the ruins of the farm or under
the canvas of that truck we had seen
creeping down to the village

  i dont want to go up there alone
without you i told him if you are
right about those things they found
youll be needed here ill stay and do
what i can to help

  prentiss smiled i know he said i
feel the same way and-i think i can
help

  with an understanding that is rare in
men of his profession hewitt had not
spoken since we passed that first black-
ened pile now he pointed ahead

  there it is he said soberly can
i stick with you men id like you to
sort of tone down what i write if you

will this isnt like what we get in the
city

  by all means prentiss told him- i
appreciate your feeling in this matter
few news-men would be so considerate
of our wishes i promise you you will
not lose because of us

  together we drove down to the
charred and broken ruin that was gran-
by men had been searching the ruins
laying together in the little church-yard
the bodies of those they found long
stiff rows of canvas stared at us from
among the old white stones before the
church a knot of men had gathered we
went toward them the street was a
shambles hideous with the memory of
what had been hewitt dropped behind
i saw him poking with a splintered axe-
helve among the embers of the parson-
age here outside the old wooden
church the futile battle had been fiercest
he stooped and picked something up
stood staring at it a moment then
came hurrying after us just then the
men in front of the church looked up
and saw us

  i knew most of them-men from
near-by villages and more distant farms
i saw that they knew us they stepped
aside prentiss halted and stood look-
ing down at what they had hidden
he dropped to his knee and i saw them
i heard hewitt gasp at my shoulder
then i too stepped closer and looked
down

  there were four now all more or
less charred by the fire they were
physically huge-all of seven feet in
height with massive legs and bodies
and long dangling arms their heads
were small and peaked topped with a
ridge of coarse white hair their scaly
skin was the sickly white of a mud-
fishs belly their thin lips colorless
their little eyes a dull flat brown but
those narrow faces those gaunt dis-
torted bodies awoke in me the memory
the pool of life



of something-something that in nor-
mal shape would be familiar-some-
thing that fitted

  hewitt pushed past me he held out
his hand in his palm lay a huge five-
inch blade of chipped quartz cruelly
edged its broken point dark with
blood

  there was a startled oath from put-
nam the coroner

  injunsr he cried

  prentiss rose to his feet he nodded

  yes he said they are indians

chapter iii
the white killers

 t ook here objected putnam

   they cant be injuns ive
heard tell of em in my grand-
dads time crossin over to york state
but they never settled here there
havent been any hereabouts for close
onto fifty or sixty years anyway
theyre white and their heads arent
shaped right theyre idiots like i said
first--lunatics

  prentiss stood tugging at his under-
lip frowning down at the things on the
ground

  yes he admitted you were right
there they are microcephalic idiots
without brain-space enough to kill a
fly look at the way their skulls are
pinched in they are all but animals
and yet they have weapons and good
weapons it doesnt make sense he
looked up could that spear have come
from some collection he asked

  putnam shook his head heavily
dont see how it could he mumbled
i know every collection in this part
of the county-collect myself far as
that goes ive never seen that thing
before or anything like it must be
new found inside the last month
whered you get it

  hewitt pointed over there he said

in the edge of the ruins it looked
as if it had been dragged out

  putnam scowled thats the par-
sonage he explained thats where
most of them were killed there and
around the church the parson never
collected any either

  prentiss had been bending over the
bodies again now he straightened up
hastily

  which of you took charge of this
he demanded whose bodies lay there
where hewitt found the blade

  one of the other men answered it
was the parson himself he said he
was lying on his face and the fire
didnt get at him much we put him
over yonder under the tree with the
ones we could recognize

  prentiss stepped forward i want
to have a look at him he told us the
rest of you stay here

  silently we stood and watched him
he uncovered the body and knelt be-
side it seeming to unfasten the clothes
we saw him take out his pocket knife
then suddenly he sprang to his feet and
came striding toward us

  look at this he cried it was
embedded in his chest over the heart
in his hand he held the missing
point of the great quartz blade

  he took putnam by the shoulder
they are indians he said earnestly
they are changed from anything we
or our ancestors ever knew but they
are indians nevertheless their skin
and hair are bleached and they have de-
generated physically and mentally look
at those apish arms-that receding jaw
and the ridges over their eyes they
are old-terribly old they are almost
a neanderthal type and look here
he pried open one of the hideous pale-
lipped mouths look at that tongue
they couldnt talk all they could do
was howl and mew like animals with
that deformed brain i doubt that they


amazing stories

could have used words anyway you
were right-they are microcephalics
and they are as harmless as babies and
yet-look at this thing that they have
done i tell you its beyond me it isnt
right

  hewitt had been scribbling like mad
now he interrupted with a question

  if theyre indians he said they
had to come from somewhere how
long is it since there were indians in
vermont around here

ttre dont know prentiss told

  vv him for a long time before
the white settlers came in here ver-
mont was a sort of no-mans-land for
all the near-by tribes a general hunt-
ing-ground and a place to fight over
the micmacs from maine and canada
were the sort that might have done this
and maybe the new york iroquois but
these creatures are a far older type-
older than anything we have ever seen
in america there was a time very
early when indians lived here before
the later races came into this part of
the country if they could have sur-
vived and degenerated in some unfor-
seeable way these things might be their
descendents something drove them out
back there before history began i won-
der if that something can have pre-
served them somewhere and let them
loose again but it cant be its against
all we know

  the coroner had been growing im-
patient now he broke in curtly look
here mr prentiss he said acidly
maybe its a pretty little puzzle for
you to figure out where these devils
are from and why theyre like they are
but it looks to me like you cant help
us any to tell where they are now and
what theyll do we arent all cold-
blooded scientists like you and mr cady
were going to see that this thing dont
happen twice if theyre injuns like you

say theyre bound to have the knack
of woods fighting and itll take soldiers
and guns to get em out you can set
around and figure about em if you want
to were going after em

  he got my dander up hold on there
putnam i snapped we have as much
feeling as any of you but maybe we
have a little more brains my uncle
and his family are dead up there on
that hill and the girl prentiss was go-
ing to marry to-day im a chemist i
cant help you but prentiss is a man
who can help-who might have been
able to tell you where to find your
killers if theyd been things the world
had ever seen before if you dont like
what hes doing you can play your
own little game of hide and seek the
way you want to show us where
youve put them and well take care
of our own people granby be damned
but putnam wasnt listening his
mouth was gaping open and he was
staring at me with unbelieving eyes

  wasnt miss dorcas with you he
demanded didnt you leave her in
rutland

  i boggled it was prentiss who could
answer there was an odd strained
note of eagerness in his low voice

  she was here putnam we were
to meet her why do you ask
putnam was pale maybe it aint
anything he stammered maybe we
made a mistake only-we were pretty
careful up there on the hill and miss
dorcas wasnt there at all

chapter iv

the missing girl

i saw new hope in every face
dorcas alive dorcas safe it was
too good to be true

  are you sure putnam  i cried
dont fool us dont get our hope up
for a joke
the pool of life



  another man answered for him he
wouldnt do that mr cady he said
hes telling the truth i was up there
with him there was just mr and mrs
cady and the three little fellers miss
dorcas wasnt there

  inches had been added to prentiss
height cady he said tensely theres
a chance she may have escaped to the
woods and be hiding or hurt they may
have overlooked her we must be sure
if you other men will get the soldiers
we can check over those you have
found and make sure if she isnt here
we must cover every inch of the country-
side there must be no delay hewitt
you go back in the car to call in the
troops and mail your report cady and
i know the people here we will wait
until you return and make certain that
she was not caught in town or on an-
other farm if not-well theres a
chance a big one

  it was dreadful work searching
among those charred and mangled
bodies for hers prentiss insisted that
we do it cooly-methodically-that we
avoid the haste that might mean error
and false hope every body must be
identified but long before we were done
we knew that she was not there one
other was missing-a boy of fifteen
whose parents had owned a farm far
back on the mountain then it was
that prentiss had his great idea

  putnam he called have you ex-
amined these bodies which died first
which way did the killers come
putnam stared uncomprehendingly
then suddenly he understood by
goshen mr prentiss he cried youre
right we can tell where they started
and where they left off only-the way
theyre burned is going to make it
harder to set a time

  never mind that prentiss told him
try it do what you can im going
to get those farmers to tell what they

know some of them must have seen
flames in the night and be able to re-
member the time

 by the time hewitt was back we
had our evidence the killers had come
out of the woods and hill pastures of
the furthest farm they had come down
along one side of a long low ridge
attacked granby and returned along
the other side destroying all they came
upon both dorcas and the boy had
disappeared along their return track
somewhere in that maze of ravines and
limestone spurs the pale killers were
lurking

  prentiss took me aside while the
posse was being organized i dont
want to appear pessimistic he said
earnestly i cant give you any reason
for my opinion except that i feel sure
that i am right i dont think dorcas
or the boy escaped i think the killers
took them with them as prisoners i
still believe that these creatures are
harmless in the normal way of things
something made them blood-mad man-
iacs something made them spare
dorcas and a young boy if we hunt
them down and attack them in a body
we are going to stir up that mania in
them and dorcas will better have been
dead in the beginning

  i will tell putnam how we feel he
understands mania as well as i do you
and i and hewitt if he wants to come
are going up in there alone while the
rest of the posse is making the routine
search of the woods and fields if we
find them the three of us alone are
less apt to frighten them than a large
armed mob we will try to get dorcas
and the boy away by stealth they
are indians though idiots and we may
be caught consequently one of us and
it had better be hewitt will keep out
of it and if the creatures are cornered
and go blood-mad again it is up to
him to kill us all cleanly and then do


amazing stories

what he can to avenge granby do you
agree 

   i nodded voicelessly

  then find hewitt and tell him
while i speak to putnam get rifles for
us and plenty of ammunition i will get
what else we need

  i didnt need hewitts vehement ac-
ceptance to convince me that he was our
man he had come to feel something of
what we felt i think i know it was not
solely his news-gathering instincts that
drew him to us though he passed it off
as that he balked only when i explained
his part in the final attack i could see
that he longed to get his lean hands on
one of those pallid fiends but i re-
minded him of his duty to his paper
and of what our lot would certainly be
if he failed us he had seen those
mangled blackened bodies he was pale
but he agreed

organization of the searchers

we left to putnam if we were
wrong-if dorcas and the boy were
hiding somewhere in the woods or creek-
gullies of the mountainside he was the
man to find them as a boy and a man
he had hunted over every acre of those
woods while he was splitting the crowd
up into small groups wte three crept
away and went up the old familiar hill-
road past the black desolation of the old
farm around the shoulder of the moun-
tain to that second farm where the miss-
ing boy had lived each of us carried a
repeating rifle and had filled cartridge
belts around our waists each of us had
a knife in addition prentiss had a small
but heavy pack i asked him what was
in it

   when we need it he replied i will
show you until then-well i may be
wrong in what i surmise and there is
no use in telling you what i think until
i have some evidence that i am right
the second farm lay in the middle

of a tongue of cleared land that ran up
from the valley on the east side of the
spur here if anywhere we should find
the trail of the white killers we poked
about among the ruins of the house and
barns before we went on embedded in
one of the huge oaken beams i found
another of the great quartz blades

  we went up through the old back-
pasture with its dilapidated fences over-
run now with thistles and seedlings from
the neighboring woods the man whose
farm this had been was on his last legs
we had seen the carcasses of two horses
and but one cow in the ruins of the barn

  the woods were mostly second growth
until we got well in there may have
been traces of the killers but we were
too busy ramming through the tangle
of saplings and blackberry bushes with
the least possible racket to hunt for
tracks fortunately we soon came to an-
other fence beyond it lay the ancient
open woods somewhere in their quiet
shadowed fastness those pale devils were
crouching waiting and dorcas was
with them

  hewitt suggested following the creek
it would skirt the bottom of the ridge
and be the likeliest way for the killers to
go he was right they had followed
up the creek-bed in single file the prints
of their huge splay-feet were everywhere
in the stiff sandy mud of the creek bot-
tom there came a cry from prentiss
who was ahead

  look

  he had dropped to his knees beside a
shallow pool here the killers had
stopped the creek-border was trampled
and mud-stained the bushes were
broken and leaves torn off and there
in the mud half obliterated by one of
the huge prints was the mark of a
womans shoe they had her

  eagerly i hurried up the creek-bed
scanning the banks and shallows for
signs of her presence halfway to the
the pool of life



next bend i found the prints of two
shoes-a womans and a boys the slug-
gish current had barely rounded their
edges behind me prentiss saw them

  careful he whispered those
are fresh they camped back there
we are getting close

  silently we filed up the creek the
pale killers seemed to have abandoned
all effort to hide their trail if indeed
they had ever concealed it we want
slowly and i was a good twenty feet
ahead of prentiss i rounded a bushy
bend and came out into a sort of bowl
a little clearing surrounded by a wall
of pine scrub the grass was matted
and trampled the odor of bruised pine-
needles hung heavy in the still air
there had been a struggle here

  my eye caught a gleam of white at
the edge of the pool i ran forward
crumpled on his face in the still water
a great heavy-shafted spear driven
through his back lay the half clad body
of a boy

  i shouted prentiss came running
hewitt at his heels we dragged the body
out of the water and turned it over an-
other of those great quartz blades lashed
to a shaft of oak had been thrust through
his body from behind killing him in-
stantly cutting the sinew that bound
the blade to the shaft prentiss removed
the blade and drew out the spear he
examined the wood carefully his fore-
head was puckered in a frown

  oak isnt it i asked him

   yes he replied rather reluctantly it
seemed it looks like oak i guess it is
oak but it is different from any other
oak that i have ever seen here-look at
it for yourself

  i took it the grain was right and the
color but it was very heavy-much too
heavy the texture of the wood was
queer and there was a stony glint to its
polished surface i pried off a splinter

with my knife it was brittle and
snapped with almost a metallic ring i
handed it to hewitt he tried his knife
on it it wouldnt cut

   its like stone he said in a puzzled
voice

   yes prentiss agreed it is like
stone or petrified wood it never grew
in these woods it comes from whatever
place they come from it is their wood

   hewitt seized my shoulder-pointed

   look he whispered hoarsely

   drifting down into the clear water of
the pool came a plume of greyish mud
something close above us was roiling
the water

chapter v

  xhe cave in the mountainside

reached for my rifle prentiss
checked me

  careful he cautioned maybe
they heard you shout but i think that
mud has come for some distance it
seems thin-washed out remember we
dare not arouse them something stirred
them up and made them kill this boy
and they will still be nervous-keyed
up to the brink of madness we have a
delicate task before us dorcas is still
alive and safe but the least mistake on
our part will mean death for her-hor-
rible death remember that

   hewitt had been staring at the dead
boy now he spoke

   they didnt scalp him he remarked

   that is a good sign prentiss told
him i think the boy resisted or at-
tacked them their mania has had time
to die down they were uncertain when
they camped back there they were ready
to make another raid but their madness
left them and now they are returning to
whatever it was that sent them out-to
whatever place it is they think of as
home


amazing stories

  above us on the other side of the
lakelet rose the ridge we had been fol-
lowing

  prentiss i said it seems to me
that were headed for trouble follow-
ing this creek if they had been here in
this glade wed have blundered right
into the middle of them why not go up
there on the ridge now that we know
that they are just above us along the
creek we can look down on them and
attack from above if we have to theres
good cover up there among the rocks
and i dont think theyll be able to see
us

  he looked where i was pointing the
slope was steep but not at all unman-
agable pines clung to it and the ledges
were coated with the brown needles we
could go quietly up there	

  youre right cady he agreed
it gets higher as we go further in if
i remember rightly  we may be able
to pass them and head them off come
along

  what about the boy hewitt pro-
tested we cant leave him like this

  he guided us prentiss replied grim-
ly putnam will be coming along be-
fore long there must be a guide for
him besides he will have men who can
do what we cannot come

  the climb looked easier than it was
we lost nearly half an hour in getting
to the top none of us wanted to think
of what might be happening in that half
hour none of us wanted to remember
what had happened to the boy silently
alert for any sign we stalked through
the pines an hour passed we had gone
nearly two miles without seeing a thing
when prentiss stopped

  listen he murmured

  for a moment i could detect nothing
then above the low moan of the wind
in the pines i heard the faint clamor
of crows

  it may be a fox whispered prentiss
it may be-they

  no indian hunter of old stalked his

game as we stalked that distant cawing
we prayed all of us that it would con-
tinue we prayed that the crows would
not discover us we hunted bigger game
than ever man had stalked in these ver-
mont hills since the days when mohawk
warriors donned war-paint for a raid on
the settlers of the connecticut valley
though we did not know it then we
hunted a prey greater than ever man
had known we hunted life itself

  on our right now the limestone cliff
dropped sheer to the woods below only
a squat scrub clung to its crannied face
along the top ran a thin line of pines
our only shelter and now less than a
quarter of a mile ahead we could see
the crows

  flat on our bellies we crept to the
edge of the cliff and peered ahead to
where a whirling cloud of black spun
and streamed above the pines there
where the ridge joined the mountain a
great grey scar showed against the green
of the forest the face of the mountain
had shelved away strewing the slope
with huge slabs of broken limestone and
the skeletons of trees a dot of black
was visible against the naked grey rock
over it swirled the screaming cloud of
crows beneath it among the fallen
rocks a thin column of smoke went up
they were there

  prentiss motioned us back into the
shelter of the pines

e must break up he told us
i will follow along the top of the
ridge and try to creep up close among
the rocks cady you go to the left
where the slope is least steep and try
to climb above them i want you where
you can get down in a hurry if the
chance comes you know your part
hewitt it is hard i know but it is the
the pool of life

best way for all of us creep around to
the right and get as high as you can on
the edge of the scar where you can
cover us i know you can shoot i saw
you take the three-star trophy from an
army man if we are caught and you
see the mania coming on them shoot
save dorcas if you cannot get us i am
depending on you

  ill try replied hewitt huskily
wait a little if you can im not used
to this country it may take me quite a
while to get up there

  i understand prentiss nodded we
will be where we can see you if none
of them is looking up wave your hand-
kerchief over your head against the dark
pines that will tell us where you are
then-wait

  we parted after that hewitt vanished
down the right-hand cliff dropping from
ledge to ledge clinging to the scrawny
bushes we saw him vanish into the
woods prentiss gripped my hand then
he was gone and i was slipping down
the gentler western slope

  at the bottom i found cleared fields
running up nearly to the foot of the
mountain at the edge of the valley i
could see the black ruin of a burned
farm and dots that were searchers
spreading out over the fields keeping
close to the edge of the woods i ran
as fast and as quietly as i could toward
the base of the ridge

  the climb was easy as prentiss had
said i wondered how hewitt was mak-
ing out i went straight up the mountain
until i knew i was above the slide then
came over and down toward its edge
when the gap in the trees showed i
went on all fours finally with the
tumbled rocks at the foot of the slide
showing through the trees below me i
wormed my way to the edge and peered
down

  from the naked scar in the mountain-
side a rather steep smooth rock-slide



dropped to the tumbled chaos of broken
rock at its foot at the head of the
slide gaped the low-arching black mouth
of a cave it was a little below the place
where i lay and i could see the shal-
low shelf before it there squatting
around a crackling fire were a score of
the white killers

  for a moment i forgot everything in
the weirdness of the scene huge as they
were those pallid forms were dwarfed
by the black maw of the cave they
squatted in a ring around the fire stark
naked each with a heavy quartz-bladed
spear but it was their expression that
caught my attention those naked white
monsters had never seen fire

  on the rock behind them lay the torch
that they must have carried from the
blazing ruins of some farm where an
over-turned lantern had set the dry grass
afire-a blackened pine two-by-four
scantling nearly five feet long from
farm to farm and house to house of the
village they must have carried it glee-
fully thrusting it at things and watch-
ing it feed and grow it was a heap of
pine skeletons small trees almost that
they were burning now

  their hideous faces rapt their little
eyes glinting they worshipped the thing
that they had found the red god that
had eaten the bodies and huts of their
enemies they were so close to the flames
that i could smell the stench of scorch-
ing flesh but they showed no awareness
of pain this thing was wondrously new
and powerful they had seen it slay and
consume they had made it their tool-
brought it here-fed it with the naked
white wood that it loved yet i knew
somehow that they had never known
fire

  now one of them reached out his hand
and touched the naked flame i could
hear the flesh burn but he made no
move sluggishly an expression of dis-
comfort crept over his blank visage i


amazing stories

could see knowledge of its location come
to him he withdrew his hand he stared
at the horribly burnt fingers the smell
of them came to him-the smell of
cooked flesh-and i could see the saliva
dribbling from his lips and his little eyes
glowing avidly then he realized dully
that the pain was still there his face
wrinkled his lips drooped open a cry
came out-a wailing mewing whine that
sent chills up and down my spine for
all their form these things were less
than human

there was a flicker of white far
above i looked up hewitt was lying
against the base of a big pine at the very
edge of the scar his rifle beside him he
was waving his handkerchief below a
second quick motion caught my eye
prentiss crouched among the boulders
at the foot of the slide staring up at the
cave mouth tensely the three of us
lay watching the pallid monsters

  there was no sign of dorcas nor of
the horde that i knew must exist there
were twenty here the rest had gone
somewhere and taken dorcas with them

  i saw that hewitt was craning his
neck down again prentiss was standing
behind a giant block of limestone wav-
ing his arms wildly wig-wagging i
couldnt read it but i saw that the re-
porter could he picked up his gun and
squirmed back into the shelter of the
trees i caught a glimpse of him climb-
ing still higher i watched for him to
appear again higher up but he had
vanished a twig snapped behind me

i whirled snatching out my knife pren-
tiss knelt there

  he drew himself up beside me and
peered down at the killers they were
still squatting there on their haunches
beside the fire the one who had been
burned sucking at his fingers the others
simply sat and stared into the flames
utterly oblivious of what had happened

  i could barely hear his voice dorcas
is not here he murmured she has
been taken inside hewitt is coming
round and when he is here we will try
to pick them off with the rifles then rush
them from above and get inside in the
dark i hope we can keep them from
following

  in answer i unslung my rifle and
loosened the cartridge belts then we
lay still waiting for hewitt

  it was tough going more than half
an hour passed before he had worked
his way over the top of the slide to
where we were prentiss explained his
plan beneath our position a steep dirt
slide dropped to the ledge before the
cave we would pick them off one by one
until they stampeded then rush them and
try to make the cave before they did
once inside we could take care of them
without too much trouble

  ill stay here prentiss told us it
is steeper here and nearer to the cave
you two spread out down the slope a
little so that we converge on them when
we charge when i fire let go then
every man for himself there is no
more rear-guard for you hewitt we
are all in the same boat this time but
if we find dorcas and if they get after
us hold out as long as you can then
shoot her and whoever else is still alive
do you understand 

  sure said hewitt drily thanks
he slipped back into the woods and
i followed twenty feet farther down
he crept up to the edge again as far
below him at the lower limit of the
dirt slide i took my place i drew a
bead on one of those ugly peaked skulls
i wondered whether a single bullet in
the brain would kill him those in the
village had been practicahy blown apart
by shotguns at close range

  prentiss was waiting terribly long
he was higher on the ridge than we
were-could see more i wondered what
the pool of life



was the matter was it an advance-guard
rather than a rear-guard was dorcas
down there by the creek where we had
been before 

  suddenly his voice rose in a frantic
shout

  stop stop

  the killers sprang to their feet their
great spears poised below rose a babble
of voices i leaned far out and looked
soldiers were there-the men i had seen
in the fields they were scrambling up
the slope guns in hand an arm flashed
back and forward again then with a
thunderous roar the opposite cliff col-
lapsed and came crashing down on the
ledge sweeping three of the monsters
from their feet they were using hand
grenades

  as if drawn by some mighty magnet
the remaining killers were sucked back
into the cave-mouth i saw prentiss
plunging down the slide and hewitt
scrambling after him i leaped-felt the
dirt and gravel clutch at my ankles and
crumble away under my feet-then i
was shooting wildly down the face of
the cliff atop a miniature landslide
straight for the ledge and the cave

  i saw prentiss stagger regain his
footing and vanish into the darkness i
saw hewitt scrambling to his feet the
ledge rushed up to meet me i tottered
freed my feet and raced across it i
flung myself through the opening into
sudden darkness then a second grenade
struck just above the low arch there
was a mighty crash of echoing thunder
and everything went utterly black 

  the cave was sealed

chapter vi

the battle in the cave

echoes went crashing from wall
to wall dying out in a thunderous
mutter out of their clamor i
heard prentiss calling cady hewitt

  i answered my voice pitched low
somewhere in this blackness the killers
were crouching beyond me i heard

hewitts voice then prentiss spoke
again

  get cover and shoot when you see
them ill make a light

  flat on my stomach on the floor i
wriggled back toward the sealed cave-
mouth huge jagged slabs of limestone
had fallen far into the cave i crept be-
hind one and eased out my rifle for a
long moment i waited then out of the
blackness on my right flashed a shaft of
white light its path marked by drifting
rock-dust straight across the great cav-
ern it darted glinting on a wilderness of
fretted crystal columns it swept across
their glittering curtain midway of the
cave it found darkness-a gap in the
crystal wall in it loomed the naked white
killers spears held ready little eyes
gleaming

  now shouted prentiss

  in answer came a quartz-bladed shaft
of oak hurtling up the beam of light
with all the fury of a monster thrust
behind it its aim was deadly with a
crash it swept the light from the rock
on which prentiss had laid it the cave
went black again but i had marked that
gap in the crystal curtain and so had my
companions

  the air shook with the rattle of shots
and the scream of ricocheting bullets
all about us crashed the great quartz
spears then with a rush of naked feet
and a fiendish howl the madmen were
on us

  my rifle was empty there was no
time to refill its magazine leaping to
the top of the great rock i clubbed it
and swung it savagely into the dark
there was a dull smash and a gabbling
screech something came toppling at me
huge hands caught at my ankles and
brought me crashing from the rock upon
the twitching body of the thing that


amazing stories

had me my rifle went spinning into the
dark then i was up again with a spear
poised to thrust a fierce white light lit
the cave

  it was a magnesium flare that prentiss
had ignited the white monsters stood
gaping blinded five of them were
heaped in the gap in the curtain three
more sprawled on the floor one lay
dead at my feet and i saw hewitts gun
come smashing down to split the skull
of his second like a ripe mellon while
prentiss let go three shots that brought
three of the dazzled creatures crumpling
to the ground another of the things
towered before me i saw the pupils of
his muddy eyes narrowing to slits saw
a sort of intelligence creep over his
hideous face he saw me he raised his
spear mine caught him in the throat and
he fell then i had snatched up my gun
and was reloading with fumbling fingers
while the remaining two faltered turned
tail and ran for the shelter of the gap
in the stalagmite wall

  high amid a heap of tumbled rock on
my right prentiss had been struggling
with the magazine of his rifle now he
fumbled for a shell jammed it into place
and fired one of the killers went skit-
tering across the floor hurled by his
own momentum and the effect of the
slug to come to a crumpled halt against
a huge stalagmite for an instant the
other stood silhouetted against the black
opening in the wall then he plunged out
and down i heard the splash of water-
a flurry of thrashing-silence the flare
went out

  well came hewitts comment out
of the blackness i guess thatll be all
for now samson and his jawbone had
nothing on us

  weve been fools cried prentiss
bitterly weve killed them all and now
we have nothing to guide us we should
have followed those two-trailed them
to wherever they have dorcas now god

knows when we will get to her we
have roused them and it may be too
late

   hunt trouble later hewitt retorted
theres just one way out of here and
thats through that gap give us some
light and come on

  we came together at the gap- prentiss
had unslung his pack he handed me an
electric torch

  you are the best shot here he told
hewitt keep your hands free we two
will carry the light i have spare bat-
teries and bulbs here in the pack the
other torch is a wreck those spears are
heavy

  the gap was wide abreast hewitt
with ready gun in the middle we stepped
through the light of the torches fell
on a deep pool with a slanting beach
running up from the other side into a
narrow tunnel to right and left opened
a giant cavern bristling with crystal
columns with the gaping mouths of pas-
sages opening here and there some one
of those passages led to dorcas

  my light fell on the opposite brink
of the pool it glistened with water
there was a soft spot-clay seepage
from above-and in it the edges still
crumbling was the print of a huge
splayed foot

  this way i shouted he got
away quick before we lose him

like a pack of hounds that has
sighted a rabbit we went tearing
around the edge of the pool and into the
tunnel it bent-seemed to pinch out i
rushed along it slipped and plunged
through a hole in the floor i jolted over
a mass of fallen rock rose to my feet
slipped again and with torch and rifle
waving wildly went coasting down a
long smooth flow-stone slope into the
middle of a huge room

  barely in time i staggered to my
feet hewitt came down after me with
the pool of life



a rush that took my breath away i
picked out the hole with the beam from
my torch prentiss was peering through
lowering himself cautiously he began
to work his way down the smooth rock
suddenly his heels shot up and he came
headlong at us i must have looked like
that

  we took stock of our surroundings
we were in a huge domed cavern that
lay under the crown of the mountain
gigantic glistening stalagmites rose into
a blackness that our torches could not
pierce the floor between them was
strewn with shattered rock but of the
pallid killer there was no sign

  they didnt come up that slide
prentiss stated positively they could
never have made it without cutting
notches there must be some other way

  you have the lights said hewitt
sourly look for it he had lost the
skin of both elbows

  gouging shallow toe-holds into the
soft flow-stone i worked my way to the
top while prentiss kept the beam of his
torch on me there was a shallow slant-
ing ledge just below the hole beyond it
narrowed to a crack but under the shoul-
der of the wall it ran away into the
dark around the edge of the great
room i crouched down and worked
along it to the right it disappeared i
tried the other side for a hundred yards
i edged along then a draft of warm
air hit me in the back of the neck i
screwed around and looked up there
was a crevice in the wall just big enough
to take the body of a large man and
caught on a crystal icicle at its mouth
fluttered a tatter of cloth

  come on i shouted they brought
her this way

  luck is not recognized by science but
we had more than our share then had
we but known it the creature we were
trailing had gone straight across the
great cavern while those that had dorcas

followed a shorter route it led along
a winding water-worn crevice that soon
leveled out and then dropped sharply
downward there were no side-passages
to confuse us in single file hewitt in
the middle with his gun leveled over my
shoulder we went down at a good pace
with the wind always in our faces

  for almost an hour we went down
without a sign of the creatures we were
following then we came to a sudden
bend and the roar of water thundered
in our ears a hundred yards and we
camc out on a narrow spray-washed
shelf crashing down over a slope of
fallen rock was a torrent of water i
flashed my light across the opposite
wall was sheer but above the falls opened
the mouth of another cave with a
muffled cry i drew back and pushed the
others ahead of me into the tunnel

  coming down the rocky slope from
the upper cave was the monster we had
been following

  had he sensed my light would he
turn into our passage was he return-
ing or had he come by some other way
tensely scarcely breathing we listened
for the pad of his naked feet on the
ledge outside it came he paused sus-
piciously at the mouth of the tunnel
we heard him sniffing-trying for our
scent the wind was in our faces away
from the river and he passed on
thrusting my torch into my coat-pocket
so that only the dimmest glow of light
showed the rock at my feet i crept after
him

                                            i

that was a weird chase only the
dim yellow glow of light on the
rock beneath our feet showed us where
we were treading we heard the dull
roar of water beside us and felt the wet
rock underfoot we heard the slap
slap of the killers feet ahead of us we
heard our own stifled panting but after
a while there was only that soft pad


amazing stories

pad pad of naked feet in the darkness
and the hiss of air in our nostrils where
we were-what wonder or horror lay
in the blackness around us-god alone
knew

  for hours we went down the crea-
ture seemed unaware of our presence it
was as though he was walking in his
sleep following a path impressed on
him by some external force he was led
and he led us

  we knew when we were in shoulder-
wide passages that rose thousands of
feet above our heads we knew when
we crossed mighty echoing caverns that
no living thing had ever seen we knew
when the river or some other river re-
appeared and paralleled our course with
its deep smooth rushing once it leaped
into a void in which even the thunder
of its falling was lost we crossed that
emptiness on a knife-thin span of tilted
stone creeping clinging desperately to
the wet rock while the white monster
stalked unconcernedly ahead we might
have lost him then but the way was
straight and clear beyond

  the creature seemed tireless hour
after hour we followed until hours after
we had found him beside the buried
river there came a gleam of light ahead
his swinging stride grew brisker-al-
most a run a subtle change came over
him he was aware again

  we stopped crouching in the shadows
behind a great stalagmite we saw his
misshapen form black against the dis-
tant glow-saw him stop stare back in-
to the darkness sniff the hot damp air
but the wind out of the buried world
still blew in our faces and the column
hid us he turned and vanished going
down into the glow after a little we
followed

  cautiously we stole to the bend where
we had seen him last a milky light
filled the broadening passage ahead it
poured in from a mighty flattened arch

through whose crystal draperies the hot
wind moaned with dire boding in its
tone beyond lay-what huddled to-
gether shoulders touching we went to-
ward the opening we stood in it we
looked down on the buried world of the
pale fiends

chapter vii

the buried world

we stood on a broad flat shelf
strewn with huge blocks of black
stone above us the cliff rose
sheer to the hovering clouds it glowed
with a steady light wanly white with a
taint of green the clouds were a tu-
multuous sea of lambent white and be-
neath us a wan white landscape stretched
away into the mists lit with a pulsing
fire

  the trees beneath us were like oaks
huge and spreading with giant leaves
that we could see clearly from where
we stood a hundred feet above their
tops their massive trunks were boled
and scarred and their limbs were grotes-
quely twisted they were pallid ghost-
trees-green-white of leaf and ashen-
barked with long lax streamers of moss
draping their distorted boughs and in
the far distance beyond a river whose
swirling glowing mists shrouded the
distant landscape we glimpsed the level
reach of flat white plains

  a trail wound down among the black
rocks it was worn by the recent pass-
ing of many feet we moved toward it
i stopped for one last look out over
those ghostly forests and in that instant
the distant mists drew back and i saw
the land beyond far in the distance a
great blaze of cold green light went up
from a maze of tumbled wooded hills
and on the plain was a moving blotch-
the returning army of the white killers
the mists curled down and hid them i
turned to follow the others
the pool of life



  prentiss went first the trail was nar-
row and tortuous winding like a back-
broken snake among the towering blocks
of stone at no moment could we tell
what lay ahead but as we went lower
we began to see the tops of the pallid
oaks overtopping the rocks then with
startling suddenness we were at the edge
of the forest

  under the trees the white light of the
glowing clouds gave way to almost total
darkness only a vague ghostly gleam
from the trees themselves lit the dark
aisles of the forest the trees grew close
together and their huge ribbed roots
broke the ground everywhere half cov-
ered by the thick white moss that car-
peted the forest floor into this dim-lit
world we went silently on the track of
the naked fiend

  after a little our eyes grew accus-
tomed to the half-gloom the trail or
what was left of it wound among the
giant oaks avoiding the jagged black
ridges that thrust up everywhere and
over which the great serpentine roots
clambered even the close damp air
seemed tainted with that green-white
glow-the cold gleam of slow decay
prentiss seemed to find it understandable

 radioactivitiyhe explained
radium maybe no wonder the crea-
tures that live here are mutated out of
all normal evolutionary trend i wonder
what it will do to us

  neither of us ventured to answer the
thought of those naked man-things lay
heavy upon us

  over the thick white moss we could
go very softly now we began to find
that there was life in these buried forests
an albino deer very like our own new
england deer bounded away into the
half-light in a little glade drinking
from a tiny glowing pool we came on
a herd of ten or fifteen horses-pony-
size with long mane and tail and thick
white fur their ears were long and their

hoofs small and greyish as they scented
us they wheeled like a cavalry troop and
pattered off among the oaks prentiss
stared after them with glistening eyes

 pleistocene  he whispered
pleistocene forest-horses - and
associated with man  he turned to
hewitt youll have some mighty queer
things to report to your world  he
said keep your eyes open we will
be seeing living geology

  we found traces of the human things
in the mud of the pool among them
nearly stamped out by their ugly flabby
prints was the mark of that little shoe
dorcas was still alive our hearts were
lighter as we hurried along the barely
visible track we were not too late

  hewitt expressed our feeling with the
apt triteness of the newspaper man

  while theres life theres hope he
remarked buoyantly

  silently prentiss nodded life meant
a great deal in this buried world

 we were worn out physically and
mentally for more than two days we
had not slept and during that time our
bodies had been subjected to a con-
tinuous strain to which they were utterly
unaccustomed we had to rest now
with the knowledge that dorcas wis
still safe was the time to do it

  the little pool where we had seen the
horses was drained by a sizeable brook
of the same dimly luminous water it
must flow into the river and we decided
to follow it trailing a killer along a
path that he knew and we didnt was a
little too much like asking for a quick
funeral

 we had no food with us prentiss
had reasoned that wherever the creatures
we followed lived there must be food
and water what they could do we would
do and we had had to travel as light and
as fast as possible consequently though
the more we saw of this weird inner


amazing stories

world the less we liked the idea of eat-
ing anything that came out of it we
were famished and apt to remain so for
some time to come we had to eat

  the problem solved itself about five
miles below the pool and over sixteen
miles from the place we had entered the
buried world we found that the stream
grew shallqw and that there were tracks
of hoofed animals in the dark mud of
its banks it looked like an ideal place
to stop unslinging our guns we set
about building a fire

  the oak wouldnt burn there were
plenty of dead limbs about heavy and
flinty like the shafts of the spears but
only the deadest and driest of it would
even flicker fitfully it was crammed
with silica exactly as though it had
been petrified- then we made a dis-
covery if the wood wouldnt burn the
thick white moss was like tinder inside
of ten minutes we had a roaring fire
built on a ledge beside the stream and
were wondering what to eat and how to
get it

  suddenly hewitt pointed across the
stream a tiny deer stood staring from
the forest the firelight gleaming on his
eyes further down the low-hanging
branches of one of the great white oaks
parted and two of the forest-horses
stepped out to stand and gaze into the
leaping flames i turned we were
ringed about by glowing eyes and
shadowy shapes half seen in the gloom
of the forest i remembered those man-
things squatting around their fire rapt
by the flames this buried world had
never yet known fire

  hewitt was raising his gun not
twenty yards away was a herd of the
little deer

  we eat he murmured

  prentiss pushed down the muzzle of
the gun

  not that way he said softly they
know nothing of guns now but they

will be quick to learn save your shells
for-other things cady let me have that
spear of yours

  i handed it to him he hefted it
poised it to his liking and stepped
slowly toward the wondering beasts
they stood frozen with awe watching
him come he lifted his spear to strike
when there came a crashing among the
shadows and a huge white beast as large
as a horse came trotting into the ring of
firelight its skin was smooth and hair-
less save for a sort of thin mane run-
ning over the crest of its head its snout
was piggish and drawn out into a rubbery
proboscis

a i apir whispered hewitt

        prentiss was watching it it was
nearer than the deer and seemed utterly
oblivious of the fact that he was there
taking a firmer grip on his spear he
moved toward it suddenly i was aware
that the other animals were gone-
vanished as silently as they had come
only the tapir stood there fascinated
by the flames it moved closer under
the dense foliage of a big oak a move-
ment in the branches above it caught my
eye

   look out i cried

  the tapir whirled in panic prentiss
leaped forward with upraised spear
then out of the tree dropped the image
of death great eight-inch tusks gleaming
wickedly steely talons slashing full on
the tapirs back it clung there a mass
of sinews as big as a lion its stout legs
gripping the tapirs rounded flanks
those giant tusks sank deep in the tapirs
neck the thick neck was wrenched and
with a rush of dark blood the tapir
plunged and fell at prentiss feet with
a hideous ripping of flesh the great cat
tore loose its claws and in that instant
prentiss drove his spear forward and
down and dove clear over the beast into
the shelter of the oak-trunk
the pool of life



   we heard that spear tear into the
 tigers body and through it into the car-
 cass of the tapir there was a screaming
 snarl of pain as the beast tore itself
 loose and came leaping toward the fire
 i grabbed for my rifle but hewitt was
 quicker three shots smashed into the
 creatures sloping skull between its eyes
 it checked midway of its last leap its
 taloned forepaws slashing at thin air
 then with a lunge fell forward my voice
 came to me i screamed-a grating
 bubbling yell of pure terror i felt a
 numbing blow on my thigh and my ankle
 was twisted savagely the great tiger
 lay with its eight-inch sabers driven into
 the ground on each side of my knee its
 body weighting down my leg i saw its
 muscles contracting for another plunge
 then it shivered and was still

    they pried its tusks out of the hard
 soil and dragged the brute off of me i
 could walk but my ankle felt as though
 it had been in a screw-press that how-
 ever didnt seem to worry prentiss he
 was completely wrapped up in the tiger
 -smilodon he called it it looked more
 like a dog or a bear to me but he said
 it was a cat a sabre-toothed tiger and
 fully as pleistocene as the horses any-
 way we ate the tapir

  the next day we forded the river at
 a shallow place and started out over the
 plains toward the distant hills they
 were covered with a short crisp grass
 almost as flinty as the oak had been i
 was glad that i had suggested cooking
 the more edible parts of the tapir and
 packing them along with us there was
 nothing whatever to burn on the plains

  it took two full days to cross plus
what remained of the second day after
our arrival we calculated i think that
we covered about forty miles my ankle
slowed us down and by now we had
lost all trace of the man-things we had
been following

  the animals of the plains so far as

 we could tell were pretty well limited
 to a sort of large white woodchuck some
 squirrel-like rodents and a few scattered
 herds of bison with horns like a texas
 steer and a huge shaggy hump on their
 shoulders even though we had a sabre-
 tooth to our credit we steered clear of
 them there were too many of them and
 they were much too big

  a t the end of the second day we
 struck a creek and a trail it carried
 almost as much water as the river but
 it was narrower and a good deal deeper
 by now the wooded hills were rising
 high above us shutting out that weird
 green glare that seemed to stream from
 behind them only its reflection on the
 low-hanging clouds showed us where it
 lay

   my ankle was feeling better now and
 we were making pretty good time we
 reached the edge of the forest at what
 would have been nightfall by our
 watches there was no night in this
 buried world the pale green-white glow
 of earth and clouds never changed

  the stream lay at the bottom of a
 deep ravine cut into the black rock
 there was a rather broad beach along
 the base of the cliff and this we decided
 to follow for about five miles we went
 along between jet-black palisades see-
 ing no sign of life except for the foot-
 prints of what must have been a pretty
 formidable bear then the walls of the
 gorge lowered and fell back and we
 found ourselves at the end of a high
 plateau

   before us lay an oval lake from which
the stream sprang behind us were
densely wooded hills the white forests
coming down on both sides to the edge
of the lake beyond the lake the hills
rose steeply in a series of ragged black
crests ribbed with the white of quartz or
marble but away to the left they fell
back showing what seemed a limitless


amazing stories

steppe stretching endlessly into the
misty distance

   at the edge of the lake near the other
end was a straggling village of squat
round-topped huts men were moving
among them and on the other side of
the village i saw a high-walled en-
closure

   she is there said prentiss grimly
if she is still living remember hewitt
-think of her first

  he walked toward the edge of the
forest he stopped under the trees
something moved an elephant came out
into the open squat and flat-skulled with
long curved tusks and small ears on
its shoulders rode one of the pale killers
and behind him came others-scores of
them-mounted on their strange steeds
in total silence they plodded toward us
spreading out in a long line

  they have us warned prentiss
keep your guns if you can but dont
resist

chapter viii

the sub-men

wordlessly we stood there
watching that grim circle close
around us the elephants we
could see now were covered with coarse
white hair they were very little taller
than the creatures that rode them each
man carried one of the great spears
dangling at arms length against the flank
of his steed

  what are they asked hewitt in a
hushed voice mammoths

  no prentiss told him they are
mastodons we have always suspected
that they were contemporary with early
man in america they are changed
though much as these indians have it
may be due to the radioactivity of this
place

what are we going to do i asked

the forest is close i think we could
make it

   we must not resist repeated pren-
tiss whatever they intend it is not
death they may take us to dorcas if
not-well then is the time to show
fight

   the creatures had closed around us in
a tight circle blank-faced they sat star-
ing at us with their hideous little eyes
the mastodons seemed to be watching
too evilly waiting for-something on
the side toward the forest a gap ap-
peared in the line behind us they
shuffled closer their trunks swinging
threateningly i started off into the
shadow of the trees the others after me

  they herded us as we would sheep
two of the sub-men rode on each side
very close and the rest spread out be-
hind there was no word no sound from
the man-things or from their great
steeds they did not offer to touch us
but when one of us spoke they drew
threateningly closer and those long hairy
trunks would begin to swing

   prentiss edged up beside me

  cady he murmured do you feel
anything anything strange unnatural

   i knew what he meant i had felt it for
a long time from the moment when i
first saw that fan of green light gleam-
ing through the river mists it emanated
from that light i thought though now
the high hills hid it it was in my mind
plucking at it in a sense-leading it it
was a sort of gentle compulsion that
smoothed away the protest of my will

i wanted to go where the sub-men were
herding me i wanted to go where they
went i wanted to be like them

   we must fight it he whispered i
do not know what it is but it is the
thing that put the blood-madness into
those half-human things and sent them
out to destroy granby it is the thing
that directs those mastodons cady i
have a feeling that it directs this entire
the pool of life



buried world it ts guiding this world
careful prentiss i replied dont
talk like that maybe youre right-i
feel like that too-but fight against it
dont admit it dont think of it we
arent of this world it cant direct us
look at hewitt he returned softly
he walked ahead of us his rifle slung
over his back he was striding straight
ahead between the first pair of masto-
dons his arms swinging to the rhythm
of his stride that rhythm was in me in
my brain part of me it was the thud
thud thud of the swinging stride of the
mastodons it was the beat of their
swinging trunks it was the sway of the
sub-mens bodies as they rode and the
swing of their dangling arms it was a
dull slow soothing swing of the trees
of the grasses of all the world and all
of time it swung in my brain and
it beat in my throbbing pulse my
muscles surged to its rhythm my
will rose and fell with it and with
each surge it grew fainter weaker and
the urge of the green light swelled
higher and stronger within me i began
to hum through closed lips drowsily
marking the beat mmmm-aammm-
aa-mmm my arms were swinging-

nap out of it cried prentiss
fight

  a film seemed to glide back from over
my mind i saw hewitt rousing saw
his swaying stop he turned to us

  god he cried huskily it nearly
had me what is it

  prentiss was very pale his lips thin
and grim i dont know what it it
he replied but before we get out of
here im going to find out right now it
is poison to us-rank poison cady-
where is that coffee-can into which i put
the spare batteries i gave it to you

  i have it here i answered weve
used half of them

  i know give them to me he de-

manded now let me have some small
coins-all you have both of you

  he put the coins inside the can and
wedged on the cover then he began to
rattle it jerkily angrily the din ham-
mered our ears with a discord that de-
stroyed the insidious rhythm in our
brains even that insistent plucking died
almost to nothing

  that does it he said with a grim
smile now whistle-sing-dance-any-
thing to break up that damnable swing-
ing sing jazz get some other rhythm
into you come on

  prancing like a colt he led the way
rattling his can furiously hopping from
one foot to the other i followed behind
me came the sound of yankee doodle
as hewitt danced after us down under
the trees we went and out on the lake-
shore the mastodons swinging after us
we turned up the narrow beach toward
the village howling like a bunch of col-
lege drunks on alumni night pretty
soon we all dropped into the maine
stein song and made the forest ring
with it rabbits and short-tailed rat-like
creatures scuttled from underfoot the
mastodons surged up to us and past
then fell into their old formation and
then i felt that soft insistence creeping
over me and with a cry i stopped short
the rhythm of the swaying beasts had
changed-was the same as ours

  prentiss i cried its changed the
damned things fighting back

  he came to a halt dont sing he
commanded it can change-get you
through your own tune listen to this
can for all youre worth and if you hear
me get into any definite beat take it
away from me

  so we went on prentiss pranced mad-
ly in the lead jangling his can i ham-
mered two rocks together trying to fol-
low his hap-hazard clatter concentrating
on it hewitt was clanking his knife
hilt on the barrel of his rifle suddenly


amazing stories

prentiss tossed the can to me and i car-
ried on from hand to hand it went
smashing and clattering in utter discord
and i saw with grim satisfaction that the
mastodons were stumbling and lurching
trying to find a rhythm in our clamor
and failing i shouted aloud with glee
and like a trio of idiots we howled and
hooted along the beach with the mas-
todons clattering after us

  the village of the sub-men was a
filthy huddle of skin huts in most of
them the skins had not even been cured
but flung raw over a crude frame of
bent poles there were about fifty all
told and each hut held from two to
five of the creatures with their mates
and young the women were even more
hideous than the men and were short
and squat-almost frog-like the chil-
dren if you could call them that were
simply animals snarling and clawing
about in the filth of the streets and
floors

   we peered into every hut and into the
rude corral where they kept the mas-
todons dorcas was nowhere to be seen
nor was there any indication that she
had been kept there like clay images the
sub-men stood watching us search their
village there was not the faintest hu-
man glint in their eyes i could have
sworn that they were not even animals
they were machines-robots of sodden
misshapen flesh controlled by that in-
visible force that drove continually at our
brains trying to beat down our slim de-
fense

we stood in the center of that ring of
hovels with the naked man-things
staring at us from a safe distance and m
the triple line of mastodons with their
riders beyond that dorcas was not here
-had never been here what was more
these sub-human creatures did not seem
to know what to do with us now that
they had us i could feel that the force

from beyond the hills had been released

  suppose they took her to the thing
that controls them i suggested these
creatures would never have taken her
prisoner of their own accord they
havent mind enough you were right
about that prentiss but something sent
for her and the boy-the thing that has
been trying to get at us-and ill bet
they took her straight to it i pointed
up past the rude domes of the huts to
where a narrow valley ran up into the
hills thats where she is im going
there if they try to stop me im going
to use my gun

   i strode straight at that ring of glower-
ing creatures a gap opened i went
through and i saw out of the tail of my
eye that the others were following the
mastodons bunched and came trailing
after us following now instead of lead-
ing it was right i knew it in my bones
the thing beyond the hills had relaxed
it had brought us to the village of the
sub-men and it expected them to keep
us there it had turned the focus of its
mind to other things but in the fringe
of its consciousness was the awareness
of us and our whereabouts it roused it
saw us coming-coming where it did not
want us and it sent out a command to
stop us

  the mastodons had been shambling
along far behind us listlessly following
some central urge that drew them to-
ward the mind that directed them we
heard the sudden thunder of their feet
on the hard ground

   trees cried prentiss pick a strong
one and dont waste a shot

  luckily the branches were many and
hung low before they could reach us
we were high above them unslinging our
rifles we did not wait for attack there
was no need for that as fast as we could
aim we fired at the mad-eyed man-things
beneath toppling them like nine-pins
under the trampling feet of the mas-
the pool of life



todons a shower of spears snarled
through the leaves around us and then
the great beasts charged

  they hit the oak in a wave of sheer
weight massive as it was its branches
whipped crazily under the impact i
emptied my rifle into the flat skull be-
neath without any result that giant
head was a mass of solid bone again
they came trunks reaching up to tear
huge branches from the tree and hurl
them at us then hewitt who was
highest gave a cry of alarm

  look he shouted whats that

  i peered through the whipping
branches lumbering out of the forest
on the other side of the little valley came
three rocking mountains of long white
hair bigger even than the mastodons
their tiny heads were shrunken under
massive shoulders and they rolled along
upon recurved claws that were like giant
curving sickles of black steel as i
looked the foremost creature reared it-
self up on its huge hind legs propped
by a thick stout tail it towered half-
way of the great oak behind it all of
twenty feet into the air

  megalonyx shouted prentiss
ground-sloths weve got to get out of
here

  somehow we did it i remember being
flung bodily into the next tree as the
mastodons charged again i temember
scrambling from that tree into another
just as the giant ground-sloths reached
the first and seeing them stretch out
their mighty hairy arms and rip the tree
in half at its lower fork hewitt came
sprawling through the air at me and pren-
tiss was yelling to follow before they
could sight us my gun caught in a fork
and with the strength born of utter panic
i tore it loose then i saw a broken
cliff of the black rock rising out of the
trees ahead prentiss was scrambling up
it hewitt had passed me and was at
its base then at its summit appeared a

shape that sent horror chilling through
my veins looming on short hind legs
its claws and blunt fanged head poised
to lunge at the climbing man was a
gigantic bear

i guess i fired i heard the noise
and saw the bear collapse then the
tree behind me crashed into ruin and i
leapt frantically into the next one and
scrambled to the foot of the cliff some-
how i clambered up prentiss sat panting
on what looked like a whitish haystack
hewitt lay on the ground beside him

  short-faced bear explained prentiss
hoarsely they get big thanks

  he sobered instantly we must waste
no time he went on this directing
mind controls man and beast alike god
knows how but it does it brought
those ground-sloths and that bear it
sees and smells with their eyes and
noses it is they as well as itself it
is all the unnatural life of this devilish
place and we have to get it before it
gets us they have lost us now but we
must hurry and keep close watch kill
anything that shows signs of recogniz-
ing us or following us

  we kept to the high blade ridges
where we could see what was coming
at us we kept the magazines of our
rifles full and the guns themselves ready
for instant use and when we could run
we did

  twice we saw bears and brought them
down before they could reach us a
mastodon that had outdistanced the
others very nearly cut us off but we
put a wall of rock between him and us
and then cut across the ridge that formed
the summit of the pass to come out at
last on the cliff above the hidden city of
the sub-men

  it was a city-a regular cluster of
black stone huts set beside a small
stream in the bottom of a great natural
bowl fields surrounded it and dots


amazing stories

that were men afoot and astride their
giant steeds were moving slowly toward
us beyond stretched that seemingly
endless steppe that we had seen before
from a distance palely lit and flecked
with moving herds but it was not the
city or what it threatened that held our
eye

  save on the left where the steppe
opened the wall of the cavern world
dropped sheer from the luminous clouds
to the sparsely wooded hills above the
city it was a wall of jet pillars hex-
agonal columns of basalt or trap rock
thrusting thousands of feet from the
pallid forest to the glowing clouds and
in its center blazed a rectangle of vivid
green

  it was cold that light-deathly cold
it seemed somehow hard merciless it
rose in a great unwavering shaft of
pulsing luminescence clear to the lower-
ing clouds lighting them and the entire
inner bowl with its icy brilliance it was
like a mighty emerald window frozen
in black ice through which blazed the
pitiless fire of an elder star and out
of it poured repulsion hate fear in a
chilling tide that lapped about our waists
and touched our hearts and brains with
icy fingers

  it was the mind of this buried world
and it feared our coming

between set teeth prentiss spoke
his face was a frozen mask lit
by the weird green fire of the

those spreading dots all the living
things of the hidden bowl rushing to
intercept us

we can try i told him grimly we
will try well rush them and die try-

  prentiss shook his head slowly you
forget dorcas he said we must not
all die someone has to get to her

  it seemed that a red fire was in my
brain neutralizing the cold green of the
thing in a flame of burning white out
of that flame i spoke

  damn you prentiss we will try im
not afraid of that green light it cant
hurt us and we have the stuff that will
sweep this place with a fear greater than
that thing can make we have fire
his face brightened what do you
mean 

  i mean that white moss i cried
well fire it and burn hell out of those
damned things well let it sweep the
place clean for us and well follow it to
dorcas if we have to smash that green
thing and its whole damned world are
you coming or do i have to do it alone
he took out his metal match box he
shook out the matches  the rock and
divided them into three piles he handed
them to us in silence

  we will separate when we reach the
fields he said quietly we must spread
over a wide front beyond the stream
we will have to fight we must try the
city first that is where they would
bring her i think

  the strip of forest just below us was
deserted we had feared that we would
have to fight our way through and that
we would be attacked from behind the
woods were empty but for the tiny
creatures of the underwood-the rabbits
and wood-rats that crouched among the
tree-roots watching us seeing for the
green thing beyond the bowl on the
fields in the open the sub-men would
be waiting

  i reached the edge we were spread
over a mile-wide front sweeping up
the pool of life



toward us from the stream and from the
city beyond came the sub-men afoot and
mounted and before them bellies close
to the ground savage-fanged jaws slav-
ering greenly raced a pack of hounds
out of hell itself

  hastily i grubbed up a heap of the
dry white moss i ripped my shirt into
long strips and buried them in the fluffy
stuff then i had the matches out and
was striking them desperately while the
hell-hounds sped up the long slope to-
ward me voicing their triumph in sav-
age glee they were but a hundred yards
away when the moss caught twisting a
fallen branch into the blazing heap i ran
at full speed toward hewitts stand
strewing the flaming moss from my im-
provised torch with a sullen roar a
wall of crimson fire went up and rushed
down the hill at race-horse speed i
heard a screaming howl of pain as it met
the hell-pack i saw them scrambling
blindly on the blackened ground then
we were following the flame-wall con-
verging on the river and the city beyond

that was a wild race powdery
soot swirled in an inky cloud about
us as we ran a hundred feet before
us rose the wall of fire its fierce heat
scorching our faces and frizzling our
hair the din was terrific above the
snap and hiss of the flames mounted
the clamor of the blinded hounds and
the trumpeting scream of the mastodons
crazily they milled around their huge
feet trampling the mowing gibbering
blackened things that toppled writhing
from their backs the stench of burnt
hair and scorched flesh was sickening
but dodging through that barrier of
maddened beasts like rabbits through a
hedge we followed the flames to the
river and plunged through the glowing
water to the other side

  a terror-stricken throng packed the
streets of the city its narrow lanes

were little more than mirey ruts between
the jutting lumps of hollowed stone that
were the houses under the relentless
drive of the thing beyond the light
these unhuman creatures had dug their
wretched hovels into the soft black rock
-a filthy mockery of the troglodytes of
our own upper earth with clubbed guns
we rushed into the thick of the mad-
dened crowd the stench of the flame
was on our clothes we reeked of the
flaming slayer that had swept their
strongest men to dreadful death they
scattered and fled up the streets before
us toward a great hummock of stone
that squatted beside the upward trail
out of it burst six men huger even than
those we had seen and more hideously
deformed they dragged a slighter
struggling form clad in tattered white
dorcas

  they covered the ground in great
leaping strides swinging her along be-
tween them like a nerveless dummy now
one of them threw her effortlessly across
his shoulder and with the others behind
him blocking our fire he loped up the
hill toward that pillar of blazing green
a fierce exultation swept through me-
the exultation of the thing i flung up
my gun hewitts soot-stained face stared
into mine his hand beat down the gun

  youll hit her dont

  his voice was a raucous croak my
answer a grating scream my eyes
burned with soot and ash my legs were
faltering giving way i stumbled and
plunged headlong among the rocks
while prentiss and hewitt went leaping
over me staggering up the steep hill

  i dragged myself to my feet and stood
swaying the five had stopped had
turned at bay and with a shout prentiss
and hewitt were at them their clubbed
rifles flailing with superhuman force i
saw prentiss wrest a spear from the
screaming giant that confronted him and
plunge it butt first through the creatures

body and deep into the back of the one
beyond i saw the butt of his rifle splinter
on one of those hideous skulls and the
barrel bend as it crashed into another
the five were down hewitt was down
and prentiss was racing alone after the
yelling monster that carried dorcas it
reached the top it stood silhouetted
against the blinding green shaft the
girls slim body poised above its head
as its great arms swept forward to
hurl her into the light my rifle spoke
the monster crumpled she vanished
and the world went out

the pool of life

i struggled out of darkness
into the cold green glare of the
thing on the hillside above me
hewitt was staggering to his feet i
called to him and stumbled up after him

  we came to the shaft of green two
huge crystals of milky quartz flanked it
between them and through them poured
the light revealing the hideous naked
thing that sprawled on its face at the
portal i seized hewitts shoulder to-
gether we went down into the glare

  we were within a mighty oval emerald
a thousand feet above us curved the
ceiling and as far in front rose the
rounded hollowed wall they were
smoothed out of the heart of the rock
and they were afire with a pulsing cor-
ruscating greenness that poured over
them in the shifting changing curtains
of the aurora bubbles of emerald light
rose out of the depths of the stone and
burst through the drapery of light and
for all its blazing beauty that light was
deathly cold

my eyes fell the floor was a shallow
cup of black sand face up upon it lay
dorcas prentiss kneeling beside her
and beyond them was the pool i
a queer hush seemed to spread from

deep within me the pounding of my
heart quieted my vision cleared my
breath came freely the green glory was
soft now cool and soothing and kind
it filled me with a content such as i had
never known could be it filled me with
a new strange vibrant life of its own
a life that was infinitely great and in-
finitely good

  i stepped down over the soft black
sands to the brink of the pool hewitt
was beside me and bearing dorcas in
his folded arms prentiss came behind us

  it was not large-a nearly circular
pool possibly ten feet in diameter that
filled the center of the floor it was
transparent sparklingly crystaline with
a faint milky opalescence a clear white
light seemed to rise from within it
pouring out of its facets like the fire of
a great living jewel

  for it was faceted and it was alive its
surface was covered with tiny hexagonal
cells half a centimeter in diameter from
their cloudy centers radiated threads of
white light repelling each other bend-
ing back at the boundaries beneath the
surface i could see others close-packed
like the cells of a giant honeycomb out
of them from their radiant threads
came the white fire a faintly glowing
mist seemed to hover over it all shroud-
ing it from our violating stare

  life has a presence of its own and
the pool was alive i could feel it it
was as if a vastly developed human
mind were prying gently at my con-
scienciousness impressing upon my mind
the fact of its presence seducing me to
subjugation it looked alive the tiny
cells of its body were ever moving shift-
ing changing their shapes and boundar-
ies a rush of flowing motion would
sweep up through them out of the
luminous depths and disperse over the
quiet surface like a nervous tremor run-
ning through quiescent flesh deep with-
in it filaments of lengthened cells would
the pool of life



form like white-lit ropes and crowd
together in knots and bundles that
drifted slowly through its body cells
parting before them closing again after
them then a little shiver of infinitely
swift motion would pass over it and
through it and it would lie still think-
ing watching

  it could not see-it had no senses
such as ours-but it could feel our minds
as we could feel its vastly greater mind
-the mind that controlled this buried
world and its weirdly ancient life this
world was its body its eyes and ears
and nostrils were those of the living
things whose life and mind it was it
saw with their eyes and knew what they
knew their cramped and shrunken
brains were vessels into which it poured
its will their brutish bodies its living
tools and we were alien to it resist-
ant to its searching plucking commands
it must control us-or eliminate us

something made me kneel and
touch it a jolt of fierce energy
surged through my arm and body the
thing had a vast potential of its own
above that of the bowl of blade sand in
which it lay it maintained that poten-
tial as it maintained the boundaries of
its myriad cells-by conscious effort-
by life this was proof the pool was
alive

  i rolled my coat and knelt on it it
was poor enough insulation but perhaps
it would do i touched the pool again
again that thrill of eneregy ran through
me and i saw that the cells that i had
touched were clouding thickening their
white filaments dimming and going out
then around them came a little vortex
of cells brighter than the rest their
gleaming whirl sucked down the dulled
dying cells whose life-energy i had
discharged the surface was dimpled for
a moment by their swift motion then
it was still

  what is it cady  prentiss had ages
of sorrow in his voice dorcas lay
senseless beside him

   it is life i told him softly it is
a pool of life it is the great thing
that we have felt-the mind and soul
of this world it wants our bodies and
our minds to be its own to merge with
the rest

  i had felt it he assented i was
certain but what does it matter now
dorcas is-gone

  i bent over her her pulse was stilt
she was not breathing yet her body
was curiously warm

  prentiss i cried there is a pos-
sibility i feel it will you try
what is it he begged anything
-i will try anything

  she isnt dead i told him it is
some sort of trance or coma and i
think there is just one thing that can
bring her back again-the pool lay her
here beside it close to it now con-
centrate-pour all your mind into it and
her let it get the control that it is seek-
ing but hold your every thought to her
make her part of your own mind so
that when it takes you and animates
you with its life or will it must take her
and animate her too hewitt-you wait
be careful if we succeed alone try to
bring us back to ourselves if we fail
i ask you to help to join us will you
sure he said huskily who
wouldnt

  we crouched there beside her staring
at her and the pool beyond her i drove
every thought from my mind but the
image of her and of the pool i saw her
alive again-walking talking and i
welcomed the power of the pool

  i felt it growing on me-that same
soft subtle compulsion that leading
that i had felt before i felt it explor-
ing me cautiously seeking resistance
then as it found none swelling trium-
phantly reaching out exultant arms into


amazing stories

the deepest corners of my will and
memory-possessing me with all my
mind i held to the thought of dorcas
that thought was a rock a sort of
island in a great still pool of limpid
peace it irked me annoyed me but
something deep within me held it firm
and i felt the mind of the pool pour
over it dissolve it and make me utterly
its own

  i was not john cady i was no man i
was a great vibrant awareness of all this
cavern world i was its trees its moss
its erisp grass i was its beasts mastodon
and sabre-tooth and rabbit i was its
brutish man-things huddled in their
skin-huts and rude caves i was all of
it at once all together i was the pool
of life

i felt my mighty will withdrawing
from that glowing world beyond the
pool i lost my awareness of it save for
a shifting shadow of a shadow at the
fringe of my consciousness a man-a
mans mind-was all my world i poured
iato it i filled it i surged into its
deepest corner and i found a hard
dark spot that i could not penetrate

  i explored that yielding mind i
poured over and around that still hard
barrier and learned its shape and nature
it took form and as i realized it it
began to soften to shrink away under
my insidious urging then grimly it con-
tracted to a tight firm knot and held it
defied me it began to grow again-to
crowd me out of that captive mind with
a rush it hurled me out and in that in-
stant the world poured in burst over
me and was gone leaving one vision
one thought one purpose-dorcas

  her mind was shrouded in gray mist
it clung evilly to me oozed sluggishly
about me as i thrust my brightness into
it i knew that clammy darkness it was
my antithesis-my utter absence it was
death

  little by little i drove gray death out
of that chilled mind i lit its crannies
with life i roused its mired memories
and made them mine i felt the body
that was part of it stir and wake i felt
two great thoughts rise in it and grow
crushing me forcing me back they had
names they were men they were the
men i had taken the man i was and as
they grew there appeared in the placid
minds of those men similar thoughts
the thoughts that had defied me before
thoughts of her that were no longer
thoughts of me she was out of me
now beyond me and they were fast
leaving me my hold was weakening
one brain was closing-was closed i
hurled all my effort into the other and
for a moment it faltered and yielded
then surged desperately against me i
felt it closing the buried world flashed
up before me spun round me and
vanished in a mighty blaze of green

  i sat up

  i was john cady

  i heard a glad cry j  howard 

  dorcas was alive

chapter xi

captives of the pool

we were captives of the pool
into its green-lit shrine none of
the creatures of the buried world
dared to come had it willed it i think
it could have broken down the resistance
of their instinctive terror and brought
them to it but it did not somewhere
in it was that shadow of piquance that
we know so well in the human mind-
the desire to overcome opposition alone
mentally without calling on the myriad
physical members of its vast body

  had we tried to leave to reach the
outer world all that body would have
united against us the sub-men were
gathered at their rude stone city now
with their stubby-legged otter-headed
the pool of life



hounds out of awe of us who had
dared the glory of the shrine or more
probably by command of the pool they
brought food and water and many other
things in tribute then drew back when
we went out to bring them in a troop
of the mastodons kept near us drawn up
in a long curved line across the narrow
defile that led to the portal and the pool
there would be no escape

  we kept a guard some of us awake
while the others slept in sleep the pool
grew strong and should it seize all our
minds it would be the end of everything
one normal mind could wake us if we
were not absolutely lost as hewitt had
done when we drew life into dorcas

  she did not like to talk of those dread-
ful days before we came we respected
her silence but little by little we learned
the rough outlines of what had happened

  she had wakened to see granby in
flames she had dressed-pulled on a few
clothes over her pyjamas and slipped her
feet into shoes her father was up and
together they went down the hill to see
what had happened half way to the
village they were confronted by the kill-
ers a shower of spears buzzed around
them wounding her father and tearing
her dress and then they ran for their
lives with the howling yammering fiends
at their heels

  she fell and rolled into the ditch that
is all that saved her life for the mad-
ness was on them a spear drove through
her coat and pinned her to the ground
her head struck against the base of a
tree and that is all she remembered for
a long time

  the pool seeing her with the saner
eyes of the creatures that had not killed
the rear-guard of its fiendish army took
her for a specimen when she came to
herself she was flung over the naked
shoulder of one of the monsters and the
boy was being driven along ahead she
cried out and tried to tear herself free

and the boy snatched a spear from the
hand of one of the giants and tried to
help her she saw them kill him i am
thankful that she never witnessed the
horror that they had left in the village
and at the home she loved

  drawn by the summons of the pool
the sub-men bore her endlessly down
through the blackness of the great cave
to their buried world twice in the
march across its pallid plains they had
killed bison for food there was no
effort no fear on the part of the beasts
their docility and the mechanical un-
feeling way in which they were butchered
by the sub-human monsters that held
her prisoner sickened her they simply
came and were killed and the sub-men
filled their bellies with the reeking flesh
because their mind the mind of the pool
of life had felt their hunger

  for almost a day before we came she
had been held in the wretched hut where
we had found her six of the killers
watched her constantly had she but
known it they were the chosen eyes of
the pool examining her satisfying its
superhuman curiosity had we not come
when we did-but i dare not think of
that we came we were here and
now she must forget

  with hewitt and prentiss she seemed
drawn to the sub-men and their weirdly
contradictory life now that the fear
and horror were gone they were like
beasts in a zoo-curiosities to be
watched the three of them would sit
on the hillside above the city and stare
for hours at a time when the attention
of the pool was withdrawn the creatures
would sit or stand like sodden clay
images helpless barely able to move
and breathe yet when the mind of the
pool possessed them again all of them
from the oldest man to the smallest child
would fall to cunningly flaking quartz
for knives and spear-blades their great
oaken spears hung like so many logs


amazing stories

from the end of their arms when the
pool withdrew yet under its direction
they hurled them unerringly they were
machines wonderfully complex and deli-
cate machines and without the power
of the pool to drive them they were
mere lumps of flesh and bone

it was the pool that interested me i
knew that there were scientists who
had duplicated life-forms with silicates
and other inorganic matter i knew that
they had mimicked cellular structure by
the diffusion of colored solutions in a
bowl of liquid such as the pool was
physically i knew that life maintains a
difference in potential between a living
thing and its environment-a potential
that slowly disappears with death i
knew that there were a few who believed
that radioactivity could generate life and
was necessary to it out of the facts and
theories of a cold unimaginative science
i built my knowledge of the pool

  physically it was a colloidal sol of
silicic acid or silicates it was activated
by the radioactivity that emanated from
everything in this buried world this oval
cavern of green light in particular its
cells were maintained by concentration
differences and their shift and flow
under the direction of its mental forces
was due to the interface forces that
chemistry is just beginning to under-
stand only-had it been merely a pool
of colloidal silica-those forces would
have reached an equilibrium those cells
would have flowed together and become
one solution and the enormous energy
stored in them would have dissipated
life maintained them consciously life
kept up those potentials life changed
the ever-shifting cells and moved them
in groups in unison as our muscles
move only vastly more flexibly this
thing was liquid life-a pool of life
itself

  the sub-men were never quiet now

they were making spears in enormous
quantities new herds of mastodons and
packs of the otter-dogs came in of their
own accord from the plains and forests
all the animal life of the buried world
seemed to be concentrating around them
and their city what did it mean

  then came the clue that answered
everything dorcas is an excellent shot
with the bow as a child she used to
bag rabbits and squirrels regularly and
on one hunting trip she got a bear
hewitt was a crack shot with a rifle all
one day they had been arguing the
merits of their pet weapons and dorcas
had remarked that if the sub-men had
bows they would stand an excellent
chance against riflemen that same night
she says she dreamed of making a bow
and arrows and hunting with them in
the morning it took nearly an hour to
waken her the pool had broken down
her guard and no sooner had she left
the cave than her cry of surprise brought
us running

  howard she cried look theyre
making arrows

  she was right through her-from
what it had read or felt when it had
submerged her mind in its own-the
pool had learned the secret of the bow
the sub-men would no longer be limited
to their unwieldy spears and then an
awful thought came to me four days
had passed since i had made myself
part of it and freed dorcas for more
than an hour my mind had been its
own and my memories bare to it what
had it learned

  the stinging gas that had tainted the
air for the last two days flashed into
my mind chlorine the pool was mak-
ing chlorine

  the others stared as if i were mad

  but john protested dorcas they
are savages-feeble-minded ones at that
they are still in the stone age-little
more than animals dont be foolish
the pool of life



 the pool isnt feeble-minded i
replied grimly they learned how
to make arrows didnt they they read
your mind-or that damned thing in
there did im not afraid of them
theyre nothing but so much pulp its
the pool that is driving them and you
know it as well as i do im a chemist
it got at my brain and learned what i
knew maybe i worked with their hands
myself while i was part of it i tell
you theyre making chlorine and they-it
-has some use for it

 we must be sure said prentiss
what would they need where are
they apt to be

 they need salt and water-no more
with their potential you know the tre-
mendous electrical energy that that
thing can control if it cant supply the
current itself it will make batteries but
prentiss-why does it need the chlorine 
what is it planning

  i intend to find out he replied
coolly cover us hewitt and keep an
eye on dorcas she can have the other
rifle you and i are going down there
cady and if you are right we will have
to stop it somehow putting poison-gas
and maybe gunpowder in the hands of
that thing is like letting hell loose
the trees were near on the right and
the line of mastodons had been with-
drawn to the city dashing into the
shelter of the trees we raced at top
speed down the hill we heard the
trumpeted alarm of the mastodons and
the clamor of the sub-men we heard
them rush past us up the hill and the
crack of rifles from above hewitt and
dorcas were diverting their attention
then we were among the stone huts and
out again on the other side

  beside the creek was a huge heap of
crushed rock-salt a large double-necked
crock of rudely glazed red clay stood be-
side it and a long row of smaller open
jars thick wires of native copper and

what looked like zinc led from them to
the electrolytic cell and a bloated deer-
skin was tied over the neck of the jar
the pool had drained my brain it was
making chlorine

  i went over to a second pile of whitish
crystals that lay beside the first i tasted
them saltpeter they had sulfur and
they had charcoal black powder was a
matter of mixing

  come on back i said i was right
they have chlorine and they will have
gunpowder we have to think and act
fast or something is going to get beyond
stopping

  they let us return between two men-
acing lines of the sub-men with ready
spears the mastodons formed their
line a bare fifty feet from the portal
of the cavern of the thing standing
hideously ready in the green glare that
poured from between the crystal shafts
there would be no second escape

  we held a council of war it had to
be war now there was nothing else and
there seemed to be just one thing to do
prentiss expressed it simply

  someone- has to go to that thing
again willingly and let it take him it
cannot be cady the damage is probably
done already but if the pool learns any
more chemistry it may get out of reach
of our few resources hewitt we need
for his marksmanship besides guns are
a thing that it has not yet learned to
make or use i will go if you cannot
get me back chance hewitt

  we stood and watched him go dorcas
was deathly pale and her hand in mine
was icy he strode down to the edge
of the pool and stood staring into its
lambent depths it seemed that it was a
great blank eye staring back his head
bent his body went lax and in the
pool the stir of life was swelling the
white filaments growing brighter the
dimpling vortices swirling madly over
its dappled surface his was a mind


amazing stories

that it had never fully overcome and it
was eager-horribly eager it was all
astir with evil glinting life slowly his
knees bent and he crumpled to the black
sands

for two hours by my watch we
waited the green glare of the cavern
beating down on the still form and on
the quiescent pool beyond it was a ter-
rible strain on all of us dorcas in par-
ticular but it had to be then we tried
to wake him we dragged him out into
the open air where that cold green light
no longer beat pitilessly upon him and
the pool no longer glimmered evilly in
its setting of jetty sand we shouted we
jangled the tin-can rattle that had saved
us before we pumped at his arms and
shook him savagely it was useless he
lay like a log his face drawn and white
his pulse barely moving

  i went back into that cold green hell
and i stood on its black sands and cursed
the placid pool its shifting cells twinkled
and sparkled in mockery it heard it
understood for the rigid body of how-
ard prentiss rose to its feet and stalked
like a thing of metal down the hill to-
ward the city of the killers the ranks
of the mastodons parted to let him pass
their great trunks swaying their little
eyes gleaming maliciously in the green
light

  dorcas screamed i reached the crystal
portal in time to see her duck under the
massive threatening form of a mastodon
and catch prentiss by his arm he never
stirred his arm came slowly forward
in time with the beat of the swaying
mastodons she stumbled and fell

  a red-black haze seemed to rise with-
in me and burst i knew i was shouting
like a crazy man i knew i was shooting
wildly madly and that with every smash-
ing explosion a pallid man-thing crumpled
where he sat i knew that hewitt was
shooting too and that i had reloaded

and emptied my rifle clip twice i knew
that the little eyes of a mastodon had
gone dripping red and that it screamed
horribly with pain and crashed headfirst
into the basalt rampart before it fell in
a dead lump i knew that in the stone
city the pallid sub-men were milling
about in confusion and that their hellish
hounds were racing up the slope their
bellies hugging the ground a hail of lead
checking them and beating them back
and through it all i saw a tall blonde
man who stalked slowly down the hill-
side marvelously untouched-a man who
stopped-who turned-who plunged up
toward us with a shout and scooped up
the limp form that lay senseless on the
ground he hurled his big body between
two of the plunging mastodons evading
their flailing trunks by sheer magic he
was running toward me he struck up
my arm

   stop cried prentiss im all right
you got me back

chapter xii

the threat of the buried world

i think my brain had been like
the gathering charge of a thunder-
cloud piling up waiting to smash
through the air to the ground in spitting
flame the tension of my struggle with
the pool for mastery of my mind the
growing horror of prentiss coma and
of dorcas dull despair the final gloat-
ing triumph of the pool-it was too
much all my pent-up emotions burst
loose in an unchecked torrent of blood-
mad hunger to kill to destroy they
cleared my brain and they threatened
the body of the pool diverted its at-
tention and let the thought of dorcas
and the sound of her last despairing cry
break through into prentiss conscious-
ness it coursed through him like fire
and before the pool could regain its
control he escaped it
the pool of life



  he sat there in the green glare from
the cave and stared at the buried world
with lurking horror in his eyes slowly
he told us of what he had known when
he was of the pool and knew its plan

  it is tremendous he muttered
awedly it is the mental life of every
living thing in this entire cavern-world
as its will crept into me i began to
catch glimpses of things-feelings more
than sight really i saw you three stand-
ing over me i saw the flake of quartz
that i was chipping i saw the otter-
dogs snarling about my feet leaping at
me clamoring for meat and i threw
them the flayed carcass of a deer

  i tore at that deer with my naked
teeth and felt its hot blood in my throat
i was staring at the crystal columns of
the cave-mouth staring into the green
light that poured from between them
and as i stared i swayed and swung my
trunk i guzled water from the river
beyond the hills and among the spread-
ing ripples i saw my flaring nostrils my
mighty horns my hairy throat then
suddenly i saw my body stalking down
the hill toward me and dorcas run-
ning after it i heard her scream and
saw her fall-saw you burst from the
cave and fling up your rifle i felt some-
thing tear through my body i felt blood
my blood running down my thighs then
there was utter turmoil confusion one
vision rose out of all the rest-dorcas
screaming and catching at my arm then
falling i felt the pool trying to force it
back and failing and then suddenly i
was seeing with my own eyes

  he paused dorcas drew closer to him
and he took her hand in his in a dulled
saddened monotone he went on

  you were quite right cady when
you said the pool knew your chemistry
it has chlorine in those inflated skins
and it has been making gunpowder-
ordinary black powder it wants your
memories too hewitt it knows that you

are the master of the guns and it wants
you it wants anything that will kill
or maim-anything that its body can
use for weapons you see-it intends to
conquer earth

tt has memories that i felt as my
own it destroyed granby as a test
to try its body in the strangeness of the
outer world it brought you here out of
curiosity dorcas you were a specimen
of the sort of body that it would find up
there and which it intends to make part
of its own vast many-membered body
when we came it had learned that you
could resist its control and it feared us
and tried to kill us it sent its beasts-the
mastodons the ground-sloths the bears-
and we killed them or escaped them
then we came here to where it was
and it let its curiosity overcome its
caution it decided to keep us here un-
molested while it wore down our un-
natural resistance and overcame our
minds what it found in them it would
use in its physical conquest of our up-
per world but we were too strong we
fought it physically and mentally and
we almost always won it had to change
its plan in part

  it no longer intends to make the men
of our world witless automatons like
these wretched human things its own
human beasts breed fast enough to popu-
late the land it conquers and once it gets
up there at our cities and the minds of
our scientists it can use our machines
and chemicals as well and better than we
can it can turn our own weapons against
us-our own minds and bodies it is
going to wipe human life off the face
of the earth and replace it with these de-
generate sub-human things that havent
even the wit to move unless it wills it
and it can do it i know that-you
know it its tools and weapons are crude
now but once it gets a foothold outside
and learns to use the things that we use


amazing stories

-god its horrible we havent a
chance

  but howard pleaded dorcas what
can we do how can we stop it we
must be able to do something theres
no one else-we have to but how

  i dont know he answered des-
pairingly i have tried to think but
its no good we would have to kill the
pool

   she turned to me john she begged
youre a chemist you know about life
and poisons you told us how it could
be alive cant you kill it somehow

  we have nothing to work with
dorcas i told her we couldnt be
sure that ordinary poisons would work
even if we had them it has silicon for
a basis instead of carbon it is utterly
unlike anything science has ever met or
even thought of if i had a fully
equipped laboratory i could only try-
hit or miss-and i have nothing

   but its alive she insisted life
cant be so very different in it and us
its like our protoplasm isnt it didnt
you say that it has cells and there is
a potential difference between them and
it has to eat even if it only feeds on
radium or radiation-whatever that green
light is you ought to be able to kill it
or put it to sleep or something the same
way that you would an animal or a man
oh if only i had some chloroform id
try it if you wouldnt im not afraid of
what would happen

   i caught her arm my eyes were shin-
ing dorcas i cried huskily youve
hit it we can kill it

chapter xiii
silica gel

prentiss was on his feet what
do you mean he demanded if
you mean gunpowder we cant get
it and anyway that would only scatter
it you cant kill a simple protoplasmic

sort of thing like that by blowing it up
i thought of that

  i waved him down it isnt that i
dont mean physical force i mean
chemistry-poison just as dorcas said
we can kill that thing and ill bet we
can kill this whde damned world with
it

  man youre crazy he protested
we havent any poison and we dont
know how it would work if we had we
cant waste time hunting for one the
thing may attack any day now you
know that

  sit down i cried jubilantly
youre the one whos crazy dorcas
and i will show em and by the al-
mighty its going to be the biggest fun
i ever had in all my life to see that
damned thing die

  i jabbed my finger at him youre a
scientist i said where have you been
for the last three years havent you
heard about bancroft and what he has
been doing at cornell dont you know
that he has been diagnosing cases of in-
sanity that had the doctors fooled and
curing drug addicts-all with a few com-
mon chemicals  why hes cured patients
that the specialists hadnt even thought
of treating

  they dont like it at all none of
your rule-of-thumb medical geniuses like
it its chemistry-not medicine it came
from a theory of narcosis that some old
frenchman claude bernard had back
in  not from a lot of statistics on
who died and who didnt he can use
the same thing for too much coffee and
for a dope-fiend and it works both
times i tell you you big ape weve
got it

  the look on his face was laughable he
simply gaped like a drowning goldfish
hewitt wasnt much better but i saw
light dawning on him being a reporter
he had probably written the thing up
when it was new and duly forgotten it
the pool of life



as for dorcas she was almost bubbling
over with unholy triumph she knew
well enough what i was talking about
it was a wonder she hadnt thought it
all out by herself in the first place

   i beckoned to the two men- come on
over here away from the mouth of the
cave and take a lesson in chemistry i
said you certainly need it

  they followed me over to one side
where we were about as far from the
pool as we could get i didnt like the
idea of planning its destruction under
its very nose so to speak the turmoil
in the city had died down but there was
a wicked red gleam in the little eyes of
the mastodons that i didnt like they
wouldnt stand for much more

   here it is in a nutshell i proclaimed
in my best pedantic mode insanity
anaesthesia and sleep all come from the
coagulation or dispersion of the colloidal
protoplasm of the brain cells or some
part of the nervous system if you dilute
it--disperse it-you get one kind of in-
sanity insanity d bancroft calls it if
you coagulate it you get another kind
insanity c and then sleep and if you
go too far and they set to a gel or jelly
or become too diffuse you have death
simple isnt it

aiphis pool is made up of cells of
x a colloidal protoplasm just as a
brain is only with silica in place of pro-
teins and albumins it is a brain-the
biggest most powerful brain that this
planet has ever known all we have to
do is coagulate it-and the coagulation of
silica is irreversible so that we neednt
worry about its coming back again
dorcas i congratulate you youve
saved our little planet from a lot of
trouble and youll never be thanked
for it at all you have become one of
the holy martyrs of science

   prentiss still wore that pained look
hewitts face was simply a blank but

he was thinking fast behind it it was
prentiss who was really stumped these
biologists and their kind choke over a
new idea

  granted that you are right he be-
gan and i suppose you must be if it
has been published will you please tell
be how you propose to coagulate that
thing in there im no chemist but as
far as i can see you have absolutely
nothing to work with you said so your-
self not fifteen minutes ago

  i grinned broadly at that im the
chemist here i told him you do what
i tell you and you neednt worry about
results i havent been setting silica gels
for the last two years for nothing
what will you use he asked dog-
gedly i want to know we must be
sure-

  sure i interrupted why man
its dead easy there are dozens of ways
to do it we could do it with fire-cook
it like an egg we could use acids or
alkalies or highly ionized salts we could
dialyze it-leach out all the salts that
are in it by osmosis through some sort
of membrane

  i dont care a hang for what you can
do lie snapped what will you use
dont snap at me like that i chided
gently its a sign of insanity c your
little grey cells are agglomerating but
if you must know were going to use
mother natures favorite poison kind to
man and beast and beloved by every
bachelor and hen-pecked husband from
here to tasmania i turned to hewitt
where is that crock i saw you with the
other day i demanded

  he turned brick-red under the dirt
we hadnt had much water for washing
the sub-men couldnt see our need for
it and dorcas monopolized what we got
why-i-this is i-well its inside
he finished lamely

  go get it i told him dont be
ashamed of it great guns man its go-


amazing stories

ing to save our skins-to save the very
world

  he disappeared into the green glare
in a few moments he returned his arms
wrapped around a huge red-clay jug i
pulled out the wooden plug that stop-
pered it

omell that i ordered

   prentiss bent carefully over it-
sniffed he drew abruptly back

  whew he cried thats the rank-
est white-mule that i ever nosed into
where in perdition did you get that
hewitt jerked a thumb at the town
below they drink it he announced
they make it out of some sort of plant
i-i guess its pretty strong stuff

  its close to eighty percent grain
alcohol i told him they must have
leather gullets how did you make out
he grinned sheepishly it put me out
cold he said it was that night the
thing got at miss cady here and learned
about arrows i was ashamed to tell you
thats all past and gone i said
heartily forget it what matters is
can we get any more  prentiss how big
is the pool-what volume i mean

  he pursed his lips about ten feet
across isnt it it int very deep say
two hundred cubic feet-roughly twelve
hundred gallons

and that holds nearly sixty when its
full twenty of them would do it if we
used equal volumes but we neednt
hewitt can you get ten full crocks like
that or do we have to go after them
i can try he said i got this one
where is that damned thing busy now 
we can go through our regular trick
again i suppose i replied we neednt
give in to it-merely draw the focus of
its attention to us and away from you
that will do it he agreed if youll
just get started now i think i can help
you out

we went inside i prayed that it would

be the last time that we would have to
go through the ordeal of having our
minds sucked into the mighty world-
mind of the pool as we went down
through the green glory to the pool
prentiss stopped me

  keep out of it cady he said
dorcas and i can handle it i want you
to keep an eye on hewitt if he starts
anything now the pool may simply let
things ride and wipe us out be doing
something too so that we can concentrate
on you and keep our minds off him

  i picked up the coffee can that we
had used before when first we overcame
the insistence of the pool slowly and
rhythmically i began to tap it like a
little tin drum hand in hand dorcas
and prentiss went down to the pool
they sat down on the black sand beside
it and turned to watch me in the chill
green glare of the cavern i could see
that their faces were drawn and tired
the last time prentiss had gone under
we had nearly lost him would he be
able to escape again

  i made the rhythm slow and they
swung their bodies from the hips in
time with its beat i saw the rapt look
steal over their tired faces saw that
they were at rest one with the pool of
life their swaying stopped but still
i kept on tapping tapping tapping to
the same slow tune and as i tapped i
watched hewitt

tte walked boldly up to the line of
 mastodons holding up a tuft of
the dry white moss and his cigarette
lighter the sub-men sat lax and expres-
sionless astride the thick necks of their
giant mounts but at the sight of the tiny
flame a queer glow crept into their
muddy eyes he touched it to the tuft
of moss and as it puffed into flame they
drew back in sullen fear then fascinated
leaned dose again even the mastodons
were watching it the slow swinging of
the pool of life



their trunks stopped but eyes glaring

  one of the sub-men stretched out his
hand he wanted it hewitt held it just
out of his reach he kicked the big
crock and pointed to the town he raised
his ten fingers he held out the lighter
again the sub-men did not stir

  gripping the unwieldy jar betwen his
knees he tipped out ten little puddles
of the stuff in front of ten of the
mounted creatures the reek of raw
alcohol was stifling in the still air there
was no mistaking what it was then he
touched the flame of his lighter to each
a licking blue flame shot up and the
saturated moss began to burn fiercely
again he kicked the big jug and pointed
down at the town and slowly the ten
creatures prodded their mastodons
around and went shambling down the
hill

chapter xiv

madness of the pool

with my heart leaping exultant-
ly within me i went prancing
around the edge of the lambent
pool to the tap tap tap of my little tin
drum it was all alive with spinning
vortices drifting back and forth across
its still surface like the ghosts of tiny
whirlwinds its white filaments knotted
and writhed in an ecstasy of eagerness
then i realized that it was trying to
overcome me-that it had the others

  for the last time i felt that searching
plucking power in my brain there would
be no other time if i failed now dimly
i wondered about the scientific nature of
this vast mind-force that was sucking at
my consciousness i seized upon that
thought and held it trying to crowd all
else out of my mind i must not give in
yet hewitt must have time-

  it was life that i felt i decided
dreamily the alien life of the pool it
was a life like that which binds together

  the cells of the human body into a co-
ordinated unity but here its body was a
cavern world that undermined an entire
state and yet-how could it make it-
self felt at a distance in my brain

  telepathy-what was telepathy light
and matter and electricity energy and
the force by which it manifests itself-
all are the result of warpings in the geo-
metrical structure of space and time
suppose life were energy and suppose
telepathy were that force akin to the
gravitational pull of matter or the
radiant pressure of light whereby life
manifested itself at a distance life
acting upon life-that was the truth of
the battle that was going on in my brain
that was what i felt my life was
being absorbed into the greater more
powerful life of the pool and the con-
sciousness that was my awareness of the
life in me became a tiny part of its
vaster consciousness and like our-
selves it could focus its giant mind on
but a limited portion of its world

  i was nearly gone hewitt says that

i	lay sprawled on my face my head
nearly in the pool to me lying there
it seemed that i was thinking my own
thoughts working out my own truths
was it that or was it the pool of life
itself my mind submerged in it giving
up its vastly greater knowledge to me

  he came whooping into the cave
roaring his glee with something like a
snap i awoke i saw dorcas stirring
and prentiss rising to his feet we had
won the pool was doomed

  we rolled the ten huge crocks into
the cave of the green light and set them
in a circle around the pool close to its
edge outside a sheet of clear white
flame went up from the other moss-
stuffed jar drawn close around it
their hideous faces painted a ghastly
green by the light that streamed from
the cave of the pool the sub-men
crouched on the necks of their huge


amazing stories

mounts and stared greedily at the lick-
ing flame

  stay inside i told the others
when the pool begins to set theres
going to be hell to pay outside keep
the guns handy and dont hesitate to
shoot weve come this far alive and
were going to get out

  i faced dorcas across the pool it
was quiet now its glowing surface un-
ruffled i felt that it was puzzled prob-
ing at our minds for an answer hop-
ing wondering and maybe fearing

ow i cried with a heave i
toppled the great crock into the
pool and sprang to the next with a
single mighty thrust prentiss hurled his
into the depths and seized another one
after another they went rolling down
the brink the odor of raw alcohol filling
the cavern we sprang back and
now the pool awoke

  as the alcohol flooded over its sur-
face and sank into the cells their opal-
escence changed to milky opacity in
the layer beneath the cells were coagu-
lating a wave of frantic motion swept
over it like a giant amoeba it with-
drew hurling its liquid mass into a high
peak at the center then as its mo-
mentum failed the torrent of lashing
fluid surged back mingling with the
alcohol setting to a sticky half-solid
mass in the little space that remained
at the very center of the pool all its
failing energy was condensed in a single
great burst of pure white light whose
pressure was almost ponderable it
died away only the twitching spin-
ning rush of the trapped vortices showed
that life was still in it slowing crowd-
ing as the ragged line of opacity crept
toward it across the vibrating surface

  from the portal came the rattle of
rifle fire i raced across the floor to
where prentiss and hewitt were kneel-
ing firing as fast as dorcas could load

the magazines from beyond the crys-
tal pillars came a pandemonium of
trumpeting screams and the gibbering
howl of the sub-men the world had
gone mad

  below us in the stone city seethed a
maelstrom of thrusting slashing mani-
acs blood-crazed tearing with teeth and
nails at the throats and bodies of their
fellows down the steep hill charged
a score of riderless mastodons and after
them rushed a curtain of fire from the
place where the crock of alcohol lay
broken on the ground into the town
charged the mastodons their great
trunks groping and flailing their
massive feet crushing to bloody pulp
the man-things that fell beneath them
their little tails were thrust stiffly erect
and their tusks dripped red full at
their throats leaped the hell-pack only
to be beaten back and crushed under-
foot then out of the steppe came a
foe worthy of combat

  we heard the thunder of their tramp-
ling feet above the din of the maddened
town we looked up to where the
steppe dropped down to the fields beside
the stream plunging into the melee
came a white wall of mighty recurved
tusks and snaky trunks hairless and
sickly white while behind rose the high-
peaked skulls and gigantic bodies of ele-
phants that towered a yard and more
above the giant mastodons there were
hundreds of them packed together in a
single hurtling mass that crashed un-
checked through the edge of the town
and into the thick of the fray their
squeals of fury mounted shrilly above the
screams of the mastodons and their
rearing plunging bodies battered their
way through flesh and bone like steel
projectiles columbian mammoths they
were the hugest of all creatures of the
ancient new england forests and before
them the mastodons were swept away
like chaff before a hurricane then sud-
the pool of life



denly deathly silence fell upon the scene

  i looked back at the pool the madly
spinning vortices had vanished the
glowing filaments were fading the life-
fire of the pool was dying and its cells
clouding the pool was sleeping

  all the world slept save us four
towering over the carnage they had
wrought the giant mammoths swayed
and sank slowly to the ground a single
huge trunk wavered upward one last
shattering blast of defiance thundered
among the hills a sluggish tremor ran
over the surface of the pool a thm
high crystal ringing note rose from its
vibrating body one last vortex spun
viscidly stopped oozed back

  the pool of life was dead

chapter xv

the last of the buried world

radium speeds decay by the
time we reached the mouth of
the cave that would lead us to
our upper world the odor of rotting
flesh hung heavy on the still air the
glowing clouds drooped lower the
leaves of the giant oaks hung limp and
flabby from lifeless twigs even the
crisp white moss of the forest floor was
drab and slimy underfoot

  the battling mammoths had trampled
out the flame before it reached the crude
black powder that the pool had made
we closed forever that green-lit ovoid
where the pool of life lies white and
hard in death we took skinfuls of
the alcohol that we found in one of
the rude stone huts for now there was
no guide to show us the path through
the crystal labyrinth of the great cave
we made a rude lamp of our coffee can
with a wick of twisted cloth and the oil
charged alcohol for fuel not until we
must would we use of precious bat-
teries

  we had come down in a little more

than a day a full week passed before
we managed to reach the subterranean
river and follow its winding course up
to that great room where we had lost
the white killer and found the shred of
cloth that gave us new hope feebly we
dragged ourselves up the long slippery
flow-stone slope wearily we lifted
dorcas through the hole into the last
level-the level of home on leaden
legs we passed the pond and came into
the cave that had marked the start of
our weird journey into the bowels of
the planet grey light shone through
a small hole in the mass of tumbled
rock that blocked the mouth and the
bodies of the sub-men were gone the
way was open to the outside world

  no one really believes our nightmare
tale of a pool of liquid life and a
green-lit world of beasts and subhuman
men that had been gone from earth for
tens of thousands of years hewitts
paper would not print it no scientific
journal will consider it yet-we have
dorcas and for months we have all been
suffering from what the specialists admit
are radium burns a little more and
our very bones would have been rotting
in that cavern world where the clouds
and the rocks and the matter of life
itself burn with a wan green-white light
there is a newly discovered treatment
that has helped dorcas is nearly well
again

  i am on the train again as i write

zmoon pirates

by neil r jones
conclusion

we are now told of the further adventures of our party of interplanetary
voyagers the story grows in excitement the dealings of the pirate chief
and his subordinates and the final ending of the adventures are graphically
portrayed there it plenty of excitement in this second and concluding

installment of the story

what ha gone before

  the story open by telling of the beginning
of an exciting series of cosmic adventures apon
the interplanetary line of space ships be-
tween the three worlds venus earth and mars
it concerns primarily the exploits of five people
tho pilot of a space ship jan trenton a pro-
fessor e j crayton an adventurer bert
sorelle and james clarkford wealthy manu-
facturer and his daughter suzette whose lives
fate has queerly brought together

 the five take passage upon the space ship
delphon which is later overpowered by
moon pirates looted of its treasures wrecked
and its passengers and crew are either killed
by being fired from the disintegrator gun or
else taken into captivity

  the lunar brigands whose rendezvous is sit-
uated in the moons interior is ruled by car-
conte and nez hulan the latter the scientific
mastermind of the moon pirates who for three
long years lay dead in space to be later re-
claimed by surgeons who supplied him with
an india rubber heart and aluminum cranium
radiophone cars and made him a robot with a
mans brain they recalled him to life without
a soul so that he became a super-intellectual
human machine of such warped genius as held
his victims in frozen terror the five heroes
of the tale are now in the hands of the moon
pirates who have their space ship the jolly
roger and their center of action in the moon
a spy it found to have been among the pas-
sengers of the interplanetary limited space
hip

chapter vi

imprisoned in the moon

the two pirate leaders left
the presence of their cap-
tives to superintend the des-
cent of the jolly roger into
the moon crater leaving a
guard of several of the lunar buccaneers
by the doorway of the chamber leading

into the long corridor of the space ship

  now that they were alone once more
suette approached the young astronaut
who had so nobly defended her at the
risk of sudden death to himself plac-
ing her hand in his the girl turned her
sweet face up to him and her pretty
blue eyes gazed into those of jan tren-
ton

  how can i ever thank you

  i couldnt stand by and see those
brutes maltreat you he said placing a
hand softly upon her wavy brown hair
none of us would let them do that and
at the time the responsibility fell to me
in view of the fact that i was closest
to you

  stay close to me she whispered as
she shuddered in recollection of the at-
tempt upon the part of the uncouth
villainous pirate to eize her

  i shall he replied dont give up
hope until the last moment then if it
is necessary swallow this

  he held a small capsule out to the
girl

  what is it she asked

  radium he said when the con-
tainer is dissolved loosing the destroy-
ing element within death is nearly in-
stantaneous take it it is the last one
i have

  but you she asked

  there are other ways for us men to


from the metal palm of his hand there shot a yellow ray of light which
burned a clean-cut hole clear through the chest of brentley who fell choking
gasping and bleeding in a lifeless heap upon the floor
moon pirates



die being a woman and under such
circumstances you have no other choice

  she smiled wanly

  but wait until the final moment he
added until the last vestige of hope is
gone before giving yourself over to
death

  thank you so much she replied
i feel a great deal better now

  were descending the crater ex-
claimed sorelle from the window where
he trenton clark ford and quenden
were watching the maneuvers of the
space ship in its approach to the moons
pitted surface

  jan trenton and suzette clarkford
now turned their attention to the in-
terior of the crater into which they
were gradually sinking the rugged
walls of the depression cleft here and
there with gaunt black shadows swung
slowly past the windows of the space
craft as it sank deeper and deeper into
the moon pit the sunshine threw its
dazzling glow upon the side of the moon
crater at which they were looking the
shadows stamped in sharp relief through
the lack of an existent atmosphere to
diffuse and spread the light

  how weird and solemn it all is
said the girl i have never been to the
moon before

the moon does have rather a strange
depressing effect upon one said sorelle

  and especially so under the present
circumstances observed clarkford
gloomily

  with a sudden cessation that was
startling the glow of sunlight disap-
peared leaving the captives to stare
abstractedly into the stygian gloom of
the lower depths of the crater com-
plete blackness surrounded them they
had passed below the level which marked
the extremity of the suns rays within
the deep confines of the pit then there
was a sudden illumination which dis-
pelled the darkness as the lights of the

jolly roger played about upon the
rough walls of the pit guiding the pirate
craft to its destination upon the floor
of the crater far below

  presently they came to rest presum-
ably upon the bottom of the pit several
miles below the moons surface

  have we arrived queried the girl

  i dont know replied the young
astronaut we have stopped moving

  look exclaimed quenden point-
ing to a huge round caves mouth which
lay before them at the extremity of the
craters interior i wonder where that
goes 

  we shall soon find out said sorelle
as with a slight jerk the space craft
moved slowly toward the dark opening
which as they approached it yawned
larger and larger like the cavernous
mouth of an abysmal creature born of
a fantastic dream

  the opening loomed larger received
them and then they were engulfed within
its interior which led downwards on a
gradual incline the tunnel extended for
nearly a half mile the slant of the great
underground shaft bearing the craft of
the moon pirates deeper into the bowels
of the lunar satellite eventually they
halted before a smooth wall of rock its
polished surface contrasting strangely be-
side the rough jagged interior of the
tunnel to the surprised eyes of the
prisoners aboard the jolly roger this
rose slowly upward revealing the con-
fines of a cavern beyond into this the
space craft once more proceeded upon
its way behind it the great wall of rock
closed gently hermetically sealing the
rocky chamber of the air-lock cavern of
the moon pirates

  a pause of a few minutes was neces-
sary for the vacuum of the air lock to
be filled with atmosphere which was
manufactured by the moon pirates and
then farther on another wall of rock
arose to allow them further entrance


amazing stories

they continued their progress the walls
of the air lock closing behind them
from here on the tunnel was brightly
illuminated and finally terminated in a
subterranean hangar for a number of
ships of various nondescript types which
had been captured by the moon pirates
and brought to this secret recluse of the
lawless buccaneers of space

  foremost in the minds of the captives
from the interplanetary limited was
the conjecture concerning what had be-
come of the crews and passengers of
these space flyers which suggested tragic
encounters with the moon pirates in the
seas of space between the orbits of mars
and venus what a story they could re-
late if they were only gifted with speech
it would be a tale of horror and blood-
shed of pillage and murder of incar-
ceration and torture of terrible deeds
and fates meted out to helpless captives
by the poisoned intellect of hulans per-
verted genius

  why didnt they take our ship and
bring it here too queried clarkford

  the tunnel isnt large enough for it
to enter replied quenden this ship
just about fits the tunnel nicely and if
you remember the interplanetary
limited was about twice as large as
this pirate craft

  look exclaimed jan trenton point-
ing excitedly at one of the assembled
space ships which were scattered about
the broad cavern there is the  antar-
ian the small space craft which disap-
peared over a year ago and trace of
which could never be found the disap-
pearance aroused the wonder and curiosity
of three worlds and to this day it has
remained unsolved these devils were
responsible for that too

  were there people aboard asked
suzette clarkford

  yes answered the astronaut and
that is why it aroused such a furore for
a short time an important government

official of the martian city of heddux
was aboard and quite an extensive
search was made but no trace of the
ship could be found

  which goes to show just how much
chance we have of being rescued ob-
served clarkford dejectedly

  i remember about the unexplained
mystery of the space flyer the an-
tarian  said bret sorelle reminiscently
it seems that this garn deblette with
two companions boarded his space flyer
for a week-end cruise to venus which
would include a circumnavigation of the
planet the only solution of the sudden
disappearance of the antarian which
could have been plausible and sounded
so was to the effect that deblette in
his circumnavigation of venus had lost
control of his ship and with a dead
broadcaster with which it had been im-
possible to summon help had been drawn
into the sun

  he never even reached venus said
quenden nodding his head towards the
antarian which silently attested to
the manner of deblettes fate along
with his two companions when his
space flyer passed the vicinity of the
earths orbit he was captured by the
moon pirates just as we were

  a most excellent surmise came the
startling affirmation from behind the
group of captives who were intent upon
the bevy of looted space ships which
had fallen prey to the buccaneers of
space

  the faces of all turned quickly at the
sound of the voice to find carconte re-
garding them with amusement

  and now my guests he mimicked
the voyage is ended and i beg of you
to enter my humble domicile

  a guffaw of coarse laughter greeted
this buffoonry of the pirate leader as
the rows of villainous faces which
peered in at the corridor entrance re-
ceived this sally of their chieftain
moon pirates



  jezzan you and bender act as a
guard of honor for these our guests
indicated carconte to a pair of trusty
villains who were nearest him the pirate
continued the exaggerated politeness
which had so amused his cohorts

  the two pirates designated by car-
conte led the melancholy group of pris-
oners from the space ship out into the
cavern of the subterranean moon cham-
bers and following came the rest of the
motley crew of space brigands led by
carconte hulan was not in evidence
having remained within the space ship
on some reason or other

  from the underground hangar of the
moon buccaneers the captives were led
into the rendezvous of the pirates to
the grand central room when they had
all entered carconte addressed the ill
fortuned group of five

  you are going to be kept together
in a cell until to-night according to earth
time of the western hemisphere when
you shall be judged and your various
fates determined at our meeting we
shall decide what shall be done with
each of you

  the pirate chief allowed his eyes to
rest hungrily upon the shapely form of
suzette clarkford who instinctively
shrank back into the protecting arms of
her father jan trenton stepped before
the girl shutting her loveliness from
the pirate chief the young astronauts
eyes bored back into those of the evil
bald headed carconte the pirate leader
scowled menacingly at this display of
valorous defiance on the part of these
helpless playthings of fate whose several
destinies had converged to bring them
here together within the merciless
clutches of these twenty sixth century
pirates the scowl upon carcontes un-
lovely visage turned to one of con-
temptuous amusement as the humor of
the situation struck him

  until to-night then aid carconte

as he motioned for the pirates to take
the five captives to their temporary con-
finement

  the two pirates bender and jezzan
led the way three more of the space
buccaneers followed them through a
long winding corridor they were led
and then they entered upon a square
room with gray gloomy walls which
were illuminated by means of a prepara-
tion which had been applied to the sur-
face it was a dim somber light which
spread its gray melancholy glow upon
the cold walls of the chamber in the
moons interior bringing them here the
pirates left them to the silence of the
place whose sepulchral drabness lent it
an air of oppressiveness reminding one
of the tomb

  what a terrible room shuddered
the girl

  it isnt very cheerful agreed so-
relle glancing around at the bare walls
of the dimly lit moon chamber

  are they going to leave us un-
guarded queried clarkford motioning
to the open doorway through which the
moon pirates had vanished

  probably they know we cant get out
or they would have posted a man near-
by observed quenden

  perhaps we are watched by tele-
vision suggested trenton i have an
uneanny restless feeling that there are
unseen eyes looking at us

  what was that noise whispered
clarkford the room echoing to his sibi-
lant intonations

  the floor is shaking announced
quenden

  it is sinking shouted sorelle in
alarm

  as the five gazed around in surprise
and bewilderment at the walls and door-
way which were gradually sliding up-
ward out of sight they saw that sorelle
was indeed correct in his assertions that
the floor was sinking about forty feet
amazing stories

 

below its original level the floor of
the rocky chamber halted its descent
and came to rest

  what was that for i wonder asked
sorelle

  it makes an ideal prison observed
jan trenton pointing to the doorway
far above their heads that is the
reason why they omitted the details of
leaving a guard for us it wasnt neces-
sary

  and when they want us again
offered quenden all they will have to
do is to elevate the floor of this cham-
ber once more

  exactly agreed sorelle

	 

  a group of men sat in excited con-
ference in an office of a towering twenty
sixth century skyscraper of new york
city from out of the windows of this
office which was located some hundred
and twenty stories above the street
could be seen the thriving heart of the
great metropolitan city

  down in the far off street below one
could perceive the tiny dots pedestrians
going about their business no surface
vehicles were in evidence being con-
fined to the subway levels the air
however was full of planes airships
and interplanetary flyers which plied at
various altitudes according to their
types and business numerous landing
stages were in evidence in supplement
to the five upper levels of all the build-
ings whjch were reserved for both air
craft and space flyers the various types
being segregated to certain levels along
near the fifty story level of the sky-
scrapers where the lowest landing
stages were located a network of narrow
bridges which supported municipal
radium cars the public conveyances for
the twenty-sixth century new york
population connected the skyscrapers

   within the office completely oblivious

to the throb of life outside four men
sat in conference stern faces obsessed
with the problem at hand

  the report from mars brings the
information that the interplanetary
limited is overdue and has not been
heard from and that nowhere can it be
seen in space its entire route having
been examined by the telescopes
what do the venerians say
queried another

  that the space ship left venus at
the regular time bound for mars with
a half billion in gold platinum and
diamonds and carried a passenger list
of five beside the usual crew of eight
it was an express was it not

  it was

  then what business had the pas-
sengers upon it

  there were five people four men
and a girl who were all vouched for by
the venerian authorities at deliphon
had they not taken this express they
would have found it necessary to have
waited two days for the next passenger
limited to mars and none of the five
cared to wait that long there were
others who wished to take the express
but were denied passage due to the fact
that they had no one to vouch for them
and what are we to do

  what do you suppose we are to do
we must begin a search at once

  in view of the immense fortune
aboard do you believe there is any
chances that a conspiracy of the crew
of passengers has arisen

  i do not know replied the first
speaker the fortune in precious metals
and gems points to that but on the other
hand during the last three or four years
there have been other mysterious disap-
pearances of space craft such as the an-
tarian

  and the prestol added another
of the four

  both of which were supposed to have
moon pirates



gone out of control and to have been
drawn into the sun

  presumably

  why do you say that

  because do you not think it rather
queer that is beyond the possibility of
coincidence that every one of these
missing craft should disappear without
radioing one of the planets of their dis-
tress

  that is true

  of course in these past disappear-
ances there have been attempts to solve
the mystery of how these space flyers
all disappeared with dead radios-there
is the flaw-but previously all efforts
have proved futile this time we must
not give up until we know what has
become of the space limited

  isnt it possible that the limited
might have been destroyed by some
large meteor that would preclude the
possibilities of its sending a radio
message

  if that is so like the cases of the
graphand and the ustal who were
destroyed by meteors through a failure
of their repellor rays to function prop-
erly we shall find wreckage of the ship
somewhere but in these past disappear-
ances no wreckage has been found
suppose the crew or passengers had
connived to rob the ship where could
they go there would be no refuge for
them on any of the three worlds
true enough

  what are we to do

  investigation is now under way the
telescopes are examining the route be-
tween mars and venus while astronauts
are being sent out in their space flyers
to find some trace of the missing ship
all we can do now is to watt for the
result of the investigation

	 

  writhin the depths of the earths satel-
lite the five captives of the moon pirates
awaited the hour of judgment to their

imaginations their future was not to
be a pleasant one so for hours they
waited in the oppressive silence of the
gray somber tomb until they should
be called upon to hear their respective
fates officially meted out to them though
they had already guessed what disposal
to expect at the hands of the pirates
sleep had overcome the girl mercifully
sparing her a few agonized hours of
mortal suspense the four men sat in
dejected silence intent upon their own
personal retrospections occasionally pass-
ing a word the long hours rolled by
suddenly a vibration shook the floor
awakening the girl whose head lay pil-
lowed in the lap of her father she sat
up with a start her confused mind
abruptly aroused from sleep unable for
the moment to fully reconstruct the
series of events leading up to the present
situation in which the five now found
themselves

  what was that daddy she asked
looking up into the grave haggard
countenance of her father

  the floor is beginning to rise re-
plied jan trenton we are about to
be released from this dungeon to see
what carconte has decided to do with
us

  slowly the floor rose once more until
it came upon a level with the doorway
as they had expected several of the
moon pirates were there to escort them
into the presence of the pirate chief

  come said one of the space brig-
ands we await your reception into our
council room

  the monotonous oratory of the man
bespoke the fact that he had repeated
this particular passage many times be-
fore the man led the way the five
captives following behind them came
three more of the moon pirates who
brought up the rear of the procession
they traversed a series of corridors and
halls up stairways and around bends in


amazing stories

the numerous passages in the labyrinth
of the moon chambers the four pirates
finally bringing them to a stop before
a pair of high massive doors which
were closed

  the doors opened slightly allowing a
red lurid glow to pass through the nar-
row crack and then swinging aside
noiselessly the avenue was opened up
before them complete silence reigned
within the high domed chamber as the
five captives were ushered within

chapter vii

the chamber of moving skeletons

a horrible sight met their
eyes grouped about the sides of
the chamber sitting or else stand-
ing upon the elevated dais which en-
circled the long room where as many as
fifty or more human skeletons in life-
like postures they were arranged about
the sides of the chamber and the vacant
sightless skulls semed as if focused upon
the awe-stricken group of prisoners from
the interplanetary limited glaring at
them menacingly at the far end upon
a dais a skeleton sat alone away from
the rest apparently the overlord of this
grisly crew

  a vibrant scream shattered the op-
pressive silence which hung like a dis-
mal mantle of gloom over the death
chambcr with its sepulchral company
again the piercing scream split the awful
quietude of the horrid room as the girl
pointed with shaking finger at one of
the skeletons

  by all the suns of the universe
exclaimed sorelle its moving

  and in truth it was the grim por-
tender of death moved its skull slightly
sideways while a bony arm with claw-
like hands reached for a cord and pulled
it a tinkling bell sounded and heralded
a startling effect every skeleton which
was sitting down arose to its feet while

those which had already assumed stand-
ing posture turned their gaze from the
prisoners to the solitary skeleton upon
the raised dais at the rooms end the
hollow sockets of the white skulls all
directed upon this one skeleton a shud-
der ran through the group of prisoners
as the grinning jaws of a near-by mem-
ber of the terrible crew opened and
closed with a snapping click what a
terrible scene this was-one to shatter
the nerves of the bravest with its un-
canny potentialities

  what makes them capable of move-
ment whispered quenden to trenton

  no conversation came the dismal
admonishment of the lone skeleton at
the far end of the room pointing an ac-
cusing finger at the group

  to the young astronaut the voice
sounded strangely familiar where had
he heard it before the skeletons jaw
commenced moving once more as he in-
toned the following announcement

  you are in the council room of
death and will soon receive the judg-
ment of the moon pirates

   the five captives stared fascinatedly
at the grisly array of skeletons who had
relaxed from their silence and now
sighs coughs and whispers were heard
from the ranks of the bony caricatures
jan trenton now recognized the voice
it was that of carconte he wondered
how the pirate leader could speak
through the medium of the skeleton so
easily in synchronization with the
movements of the thing especially of
the jaws

  the dull red hue of the room changed
gradually to a blue color and above the
head of the lone skeleton there shone a
full moon upon whose silvery surface
lay silhouetted in black lines a skull
and cross bones

  scarcely had the red glow of the
chamber resolved itself into a blue color
when a mysterious change began to
moon pirates



creep oyer the skeletons dim vague
shadowy outlines commenced to en-
shroud the bones and the grisly crew
began to disappear from view fading
into something as yet intangible which
was attempting to manifest itself the
dim shadows prevailed over the bony
structures of the skeletons and before the
wide distended eyes of the five prison-
ers there appeared the living bodies of
the moon pirates standing in the exact
positions previously occupied by the
skeletons

  then the truth struck the little group
suddenly as they realized that by a
clever lighting system of mysterious
powers the flesh and clothing surround-
ing the skeletons of the moon pirates had
been rendered invisible producing the
weird effect they had just witnessed

  the lone figure at the far end of the
room was carconte whose face grinned
in evil anticipation at them while
ranged around the sides of the room
were the rest of the pirates the alumi-
num-capped hulan was not in sight

  before we announce our decision con-
cerning the fate of you five we have
a few matters to which we shall attend
first said carconte take seats and
look on

  the pirates who had escorted them to
the council chamber and who had stood
behind them during the amazing scene
and transition they had witnessed now
led them to a row of seats at the rear
f the chamber

  we have first of all a member of our
ranks who is to meet punishment and
death cried carconte loudly he is
a traitor who attempted to steal a large
quantity of our gains and desert us
he was caught in the very act of trans-
porting the booty from our treasure
room to the space flyer in which he had
intended reaching mars his perfidy
and subsequent fate which you are about
to see enacted before your eyes will

teach you all an object lesson follow-
ing the terrible penalty we mete out to
traitors there is one within our ranks
who has honestly strived to benefit our
organization and who has succeeded in
accomplishing his illustrious purpose as
a contrasting example he shall be re-
warded

  as if awaiting the termination of his
speech two sections of the floor slid
aside and up through the cavity within
the center of the chamber there arose
a platform containing two men and an
array of intricate apparatus it took but
a single glance to recognize nez hulan
the human robot who stood at the side
of one of the machines fastened to a
steel column by means of a metal girdle
around his waist was a man none of the
captives had ever seen before evidently
he was the traitorous moon pirate

  you are about to die spoke car-
conte pointing a denunciatory finger at
the abject figure of the moon pirate
he slumped forward in the iron girdle
in melancholy resignation to his im-
pending fate but before you die the
manner of your passing is to be exem-
plified in the presence of our entire
organization so that never shall there
occur a repetition of your act here-
after a member of our band will think
twice before yielding to temptation i
now turn you over to hulan who shall
see that you receive fit punishment what
he has in store for you i do not know
but that we shall all enjoy it i am
sure

  i shall first of all remove the mans
sanity rasped hulan his metal head
and steel limbs glittering in the light
watch it go

 the cruel machine man placed a
round metal cap down over the vic-
tims head and then directed the ter-
minal of one of his machines toward
the man a strange flickering of dark
shadows engulfed the platform on which


amazing stories

the two men and scientific apparatus was
placed making the scene within the
center of the council room appear like
a shady vision of unreality from out
of the dark haze surrounding the ap-
paratus there stood out in dim relief
the pale countenance of hulan with its
cruel merciless supercilious smile the
shadowy form of the moon pirate could
hardly be distinguished from the other
objects until presently the flickering
ceased the dark haze dissipating itself
into dissolution the scene became clear
before the interested eyes of some fifty or
sixty moon pirates as well as those of the
five captives who were gripped in a hor-
rid hypnotic fascination

  the form of the moon pirate writhed
and squirmed attempting to escape the
confines of the girdle while upon the
lips of the unfortunate buccaneer there
arose an incoherent sound such as an
animal might make the torment of the
man manifesting itself in the repugnant
mouthings and terrible grimaces he
made vainly he tried to free himself of
the retaining girdle which bound him to
the steel shaft his arms clawing futilely
at its encircling embrace hulan looked
on in amused contempt the man with
the rubber heart directed a tiny fine
needle point ray of light upon the luck-
less moon pirate and now the mans at-
tempts to release himself from the steel
girdle were frantic while his raving
rose to a dismal howl of mingled pain
terror and anguish

  the five prisoners shut their eyes
against the disgusting sight but they
could not shut out the unearthly sounds
made by the maniac presently the
sounds of the man were silenced and
when they looked again it was to see
the drooping form of the moon pirate
bent forward in lifeless attitude

  is he dead asked clarkford in a
low whisper unable to maintain his si-
lence any longer

  i dont know replied trenton
that devilish ray did something to
him

  it is horrible shuddered the girl
oh what beasts they are

  he isnt dead yet exclaimed sor-
elle fsee-he is moving

  the tortured man stirred vaguely and
passed a hand over his forehead hulan
spoke again

  the mans sanity having been satis-
factorily removed i shall now illustrate
to you what would happen if your bones
should suddenly soften and become
liquid

  the mechanical-limbed man turned to
a machine which arose above his head
and directed its luminous ghostly rays
upon the body of the doomed man who
had lapsed into a stupor nothing hap-
pened until the light faded away and
then a perceptible restless movement of
the mans body became noticeable

  the rays of light which are now
turned upon the subject stated the
hard cold voice of the aluminum headed
wizard are invisible to your eyes due
to the fact that their vibrations are of
such high periodicity as to be beyond the
reach of optical perception i first dis-
covered their powers when i experi-
mented upon professor cimm at fomar
he was unaware of the experiment
until it was all over and then he never
knew what had happened to him

  the body no longer stirred was he
dead hulans next act answered that
question which was now predominant in
the minds of all those who were watch-
ing

  he appears to be dead but he isnt
his mentality has been destroyed and
the dissolution of his bones have ren-
dered him incapable of any articulation
-also of movement to a certain extent
-but watch

  again the tiny finger of light played
over the moon pirate whose treachery
moon pirates



had met this fate wherever the ray of
light settled there arose a quivering

  this tiny light is the most excellent
medium of torture ever invented by
man said hulan seven hundred
years ago such pirates as morgan kidd
lollonais and lafitte believed them-
selves to be proficient in the art of tor-
ture but their results were mere childs
play beside those brought about by this
tiny finger of light even the ancient
inquisition with its alleged horrors are
as nothing compared to what you have
witnessed i have even surpassed the
dreaded durna rangue cult which sprang
up and died upon mars over a hundred
years ago when the earthly colonies to
that planet were young and the cult fled
the earth to escape prosecution and
now for the final actt

  the arch demon half man and half
machine who had lain dead and muti-
lated within the depths of space now
picked up a long rod whose end termi-
nated in a broad hollow snout

  the pirate mastermind turned the ter-
rible ray of yellow light upon what was
left of the moon pirate who had essayed
to desert the ranks of the lunar bucca-
neers taking with him a large share of
treasure the remains of the body
rapidly disappeared where the man
had previously stood there now existed
nothing

  let that be a lesson warned car-
conte who had been greatly impressed
by the display of inhuman cruelty de-
rived from the perverted intellect of
nez hulan

  the five captives were a bit unnerved
by the insidious spectacle they had been
forced to watch centuries before on
the seas of the earth there had been pi-
rates who robbed killed and tortured
but in cruelty they did not compare with
the moon pirates

  take your apparatus away hulan
ordered carconte we have now to be-

stow upon the head of a true comrade
the reward of a special service to us

  slowly the platform sank beneath the
floor once more bearing the cruel pale-
countenanced hulan and his weird
devilish contrivances out of sight just
before his head disappeared below the
floor level the group of five shuddered
as they met his sneering gaze eyeing
them malevolently the floor closed to-
gether above the cavity into which the
platform had descended

  portho zind announced carconte
in a loud voice

  the man known previously to the
passengers of the interplanetary limited
as balfour stepped forward from the
sidelines of the pirates and faced his
superior

  as a reward for your information
from dellphon in regards to the inter-
planetary limited we have just cap-
tured you are to be elevated in position
among us and your quarter moon is to
be replaced by the full moon itself
said carconte

  there ensued a repetition of the oc-
currence which had taken place upon the
jolly roger when brentley and his two
comrades had received the crescents of
the moon pirates except that this time
it was zind who had a full moon indel-
ibly stamped over that of the quarter
moon there existed but one symbol
higher than the full moon and that was
a full moon surrounded by a red circle
only two of the pi rates boasted these
carconte wore one on his right fore-
arm while hulan who had no arm
through which to implant the moons
outline along with its skull and cross
bones had the insignia of the moon pi-
rates upon his chest just above the spot
where a long white scar marked the re-
moval of the punctured heart the
group of five prisoners from the inter-
planetary limited paid little attention
to the proceedings being absorbed in


amazing stories

the contemplation of their own impend-
ing fates which were to be discussed
immediately

  zind received his full moon the
height of recognition in the ranks of
the moon pirates which would accord
him a marked preference over his
brothers who bore only the crescent or
quarter moon and assured him a larger
share of the spoils and booty which fell
in their way

  and now quoth carconte as if in
afterthought we have with us five
guests who i hope have enjoyed our
little entertainment three of them are
to become members of our band i hope
and our friend hulan wishes the fourth
one for his experiments doubtless he
may wish to put on another little show
of some kind like the one we witnessed
just now the woman is to be mine

  with the last words carconte stood
at full height folded his arms across his
chest and with bald head gleaming in
the light of the chamber paused em-
phatically sorelle appeared the least
perturbed of the group upon the face
of john trenton there lay a look of in-
tense hatred as he eyed the arrogant
pirate chieftain his fingers clenching
and unclenching eager to be at the
throat of the pirate leader clarkfords
face reflected both anger and terror for
he had not forgotten the outlines of the
experiments which hulan had explained
to professor crayton crayton was to
have been the one experimented upon
now that crayton had gone and com-
mitted suicide it would be clarkford
quendens face bore a desperate look
which had been bom of both loathing
and anger at the scene he had witnessed
for it was farthest from his desires to
go under the knife at the hands of
hulan and he would take the same
stand as trenton in his refusal to join
the moon pirates as bentley and his two
companions had taken

  are you three men ready to become
moon pirates  queried carconte of
trenton sorelle and quenden

  no replied quenden

  never was the ultimatum of jan
trenton

  when hell freezes over was so-
relles promise

  i see that hulan has a little work
to do on you men before you are will-
ing said carconte disregarding the
stinging insult sorelle had applied to the
villainous crowd it would be more
sensible to yield now for i cannot
promise that hulan will make the opera-
tion painless and if anything should
happen that the experiment failed it
would mean the disintegrator gun and a
ride into space or else death under the
disintegrator beams

  the three men remained silent

  and what do you say to becoming
the woman of carconte my pretty
one queried the pirate leader attempt-
ing a coquettish gesture which made him
appear the more hideous

  i much prefer the disintegrator
gun replied the girl but if you will
spare my father and these other brave
men letting them go i shall yield to
you willingly

  oh will you smirked the evil car-
conte evidently stung by the girls
words which had upset his pride and
dignity in the presence of his men
and suppose you dont come willingly
-what then merely this-carconte
will have the pleasure of breaking you
to his will and shall give to your father
and his three companions horrible
deaths slow painful drawn out hours
of agonired torture hulan will be de-
lighted he never tires of such sport

  the girl broke down and sobbed her
father and the young astronaut spring-
ing forward simultaneously to support
her swaying form and comfort her the
whole effort upon the girls part to save
moon pirates



her father from the terrors of the ex-
periment and to release the others from
becoming moon pirates at the hands of
hulan had amounted to naught

  let your four companions go
mimicked the pirate leader so that
they could bring a swarm of space craft
down about our heads from the three
worlds do you think i am a fool
i know you are said clarkford bit-
ingly to even think that any one of us
would allow my daughter to desecrate
herself by voluntarily becoming a pawn
for our freedom

  ih give you your reply when hulan
has your head cut off from that mangey
body of yours retorted carconte an-
grily youll still be able to hear and
understand what i am saying

  you can draw and quarter me if you
wish but spare my daughter pleaded
clarkford tears moistening his eyes i
have given you my bonds and offered
you my life what else is there to
take

  nothing rasped an unpleasant
voice in the rear of the group noth-
ing that we cannot take if it is our
wish

  turning at sound of the voice the
five prisoners gazed into the face of
hulan the human robot whose steel
arm pointed like the finger of doom at
clarkford

  you will not be drawn and quar-
tered said the machine man in icy
tones i have other plans for you and
i do not want your life i want your
body you will not be killed though
before we are through you shall beg for
somebody to kill you

  the blood of the five captives from
the space ship limited ran cold with the
horror of hulans veiled suggestions

  you - you - you villain swore
clarkford vehemently realizing that all
the threats promises and entreaties in
three worlds would not change the inten-

tions of this man of blood and iron

  come said hulan placing a steel
hand heavily upon the shoulder of the
condemned man you are mine-part
of my share of the spoils from the
limited i have you carconte has
your daughter although if i had her she
would die for women are trouble to
such as we the other three men go to
the pirate crew and everyone is satis-
fied as far as our hostages are con-
cerned get along with you fast

  hulans steel fingers bit into the
shoulder of clarkford so hard that the
condemned man nearly screamed with
pain and then his daughter was upon
the mechanical man clawing and kick-
ing him with the fury of a tigress an
annoyed look spread across hulans
face and with the other arm he reached
forward and clutched her white neck in
a grip of steel which threatened to sever
her jugular vein

  this was the signal for an infuriated
young astronaut to hurl himself upon
the metal-limbed moon pirate and with
a well directed blow smash the scien-
tific master-mind in the face so hard
that he lost his hold upon the two cap-
tives and stumbled backward in a cold
fury of unreasoning hate he caught jan
trenton in a vise-like embrace with his
steel arms and would have crushed the
ribs of the young astronaut had not
quenden and sorelle sprang forward to
his assistance by this time the moon
pirates were pouring from their sta-
tions along the side of the chamber and
were milling about the combatants
striving to separate them

  above the noise of the melee there
roared the voice of carconte yelling
and threatening for order

 stop he commanded in a loud
voice get back to your positions

  angrily the pirate chief strode down
the length of the council chamber as his
men hurried discreetly back to their


amazing stories

places once more in compliance with
his order with furious mien he con-
fronted hulan

  leave your dirty iron fingers off
from my woman he roared pointing
at the black marks which were begin-
ning to appear upon the neck of su-
zette if you harm her ill break
every cog and wheel in those legs and
arms of yours and have that rubber
heart out of you into the bargain take
your man but dont touch any of the
others they are not yours

  	hulan did as he was bid humbly ac-
cepting the abuse in silence though
hulan was by far the intellectual su-
perior of carconte and the rest of the
pirates being the mastermind of them
all he lacked the leadership and back-
bone which made carconte the pirate
chieftain hulan was at heart a cow-
ard the men all feared him and
looked upon him with awe but they
never held the respect for him that they
did for carconte and had it not been
for the leader hulan would have met
his doom long before this

 take these men away ordered
carconte to several of the moon pirates
our meeting is over leave the
woman here-she is mine and i shall
attend to her later

  as hulan disappeared with clark-
ford he mumbled something under his
breath a cold hard look mantling his
deathly white features had anyone
been close enough to have overheard his
muttered comment they would have
gathered enough from his words to un-
derstand that already the woman had
made trouble among them

  to-morrow promised the pirate
leader addressing the three men you
will be interviewed again and if your
answer is still the same it will be neces-
sary for hulan to operate upon your
brains

  as they were escorted out of the coun-

cil chamber jan trenton cast a last look
upon suzette clarkford a look in which
there was a world of meaning and in
his eyes were the parting instructions
which her mind intuitively guessed that
she was not to forget the radium pill he
had given to her but to forbear using
it until the final moment when it seemed
that the last vestige of hope had dwin-
dled away

  hurry along snapped the pirate be-
hind the young astronaut giving him a
shove through the great doorway lead-
ing into the council chamber

chapter viii
ill get hulan for you

once more the three men were
led through the maze of corri-
dors and rooms which consti-
tuted the underground chambers of the
moon pirates this time they were led
to more spacious quarters consisting of
not only one room but several and upon
entering they immediately fell to explor-
ing them while they discussed their
situation

  it looks as if we are here to stay
remarked sorelle

  we have until to-morrow to decide
said quenden and as far as i can see
we are going to be moon pirates eventu-
ally either way we decide

  theyll have to operate upon my
brain and remove my conscience first
of all stated jan trenton

  i sure would hate to be clarkford
now spoke quenden shaking his head
ruefully that hulan seemed eager to
get his hands on him and to begin the
experiment

  not much worse than the fate of the
girl observed sorelle

  there is an escape for her said the
young astronaut

  an escape-what do you mean

  death
moon pirates



  death

  yes

 how

  then the pilot of the interplanetary
limited explained how he had given the
fatal radium pill to the girl

  too bad you didnt have one for her
father observed sorelle he would
have appreciated it

  perhaps he shall have such an op-
portunity as was offered crayton sug-
gested quenden cryptically

  i doubt it said trenton hulan
will be watching him close to see that
he doesnt lose another subject by sui-
cide

  not bad quarters eh remarked
sorelle taking in the four chambers of
their elaborate prison with a wave of
his hand

  the four rooms were furnished with
comfortable lounges and expensive fit-
tings as well as numerous conveniences
and luxuries which the three men were
surprised to find in this subterranean
recluse of the moon pirates

  they pilfered all this from the space
ships which they captured said the as-
tronaut as the three men walked through
the four rooms for a closer examina-
tion their initial investigation had
been more or less cursory

  no chance for escape here said
quenden the door is closed behind
us by means of a great sheet of metal
which slides down from above the door-
way and evidently the last room is a
blind alley because there are no more
doors opening out from it

  a grating noise came from behind
them

 theyre raising the door an-
nounced sorelle

  and closing it again added tren-
ton as with a rattling sound the door
slid back into place

  the three captives hurried into the
main room there upon the floor just

inside the door was a large quantity of
food

  theyre not going to starve us any-
way commented sorelle as he fell to
eating

  the three were hungry though in the
excitement of the preceding events they
had not been aware of it and soon they
had cleared up the victuals brought
them by the moon pirates

  you dont suppose hulan has put
any poison in this food we have eaten
do youasked quenden

  a fine time to bring that up re-
marked sorelle eyeing quenden criti-
cally

  well i didnt want to spoil your ap-
petite

  if they were bent on killing us
hulan would insist upon a more scien-
tifically cruel manner said trenton

  im sleepy yawned sorelle

  so am i said quenden

  we might as well sleep advised
sorelle no one knows but what we
shall need all the rest we can get before
this affair is through

  quenden and bret sorelle curled up
in comfortable positions on the lounges
and soon were in deep sleep jan tren-
ton was sleepless he sat lost in gloomy
meditation regarding the fate which had
fallen to the lot of the five prisoners
he was especially worried over suzette
clarkford carconte had taken her
what had happened  had she been
forced to swallow the radium pill yet
if so she must be dead he wondered
for several long hours he sat there

  he became restless and tired of sit-
ting in one spot the astronaut wished
he might get some sleep and envied his
two companions but his troubled mind
would not allow him to sleep he arose
and walked about the four chambers ex-
amining the contents of the rooms a
draped hanging upon the wall close to
the ceiling piqued his curiosity and he


amazing stories

stood upon a large chair to examine it

leaning his hand against the wall as
he did so a large section of the wall
yawned open before him that portion
beneath his hand sank backward so
rapidly that he lost his balance upon the
chair and tumbled to the floor with a
crash overturning the ponderous piece
of furniture

  sitting upon the floor where he had
fallen jan trenton gazed mystified at
the wall where the stone-work had given
way before him precipitating him to the
floor the opening was no longer
there only the blank wall stared back at
him once more the young astronaut
climbed upon the chair and gingerly
pressed upon the same spot in the wall
he had previously leaned against

  slowly the section of wall large
enough for a man to enter swung aside
disclosing to the eager eyes of the astro-
naut a secret tunnel the astronaut put
a foot inside and then hesitated should
he enter without notifying his two fel-
low prisoners what unknown perils
lay before him-suppose he should not
return and they should awake to find
him gone gradually he came to recon-
sider his intentions and withdrew his
foot and hand allowing the wall to
swing back into place once more

  going back into first of the four
rooms he awakened sorelle and quen-
den

  are they here for us asked quen-
den sitting up suddenly as trenton
shook him after having brought so-
relle to his senses

  come you two ive just found
something i want to show you ex-
claimed the young astronaut excitedly

  together the three men hurried to
the fourth and last room of their apart-
ments to where the astronaut had dis-
covered the secret tunnel- standing
upon the chair the pilot of the inter-
planetary limited depressed the sec-

tion of wall which slid silently back-
ward to reveal the opening of the con-
cealed passage

   a secret room ejaculated sorelle

   no a tunnel corrected jan tren-
ton who was craning his neck to see
farther within the dimly lit confines of
the secret annex to their apartment

   where does it lead asked quen-
den

   thats what were going to find out
 said trenton

  no sooner said than done ex-
claimed sorelle in whom immediate ac-
tion was characteristic

   wait remonstrated the young as-
tronaut shall we all go

   why not asked sorelle

   suppose the moon pirates find us
gone 

   all the better chuckled the adven-
 turer it will give them something to
 scratch their heads over

   good lets go

   the three men hastily piled into the
narrow tunnel the wall swinging back
into place behind them cautiously they
made their way along the passage won-
dering where it led

   do you notice how thick and undis-
turbed the dust is where it has settled
queried jan trenton in a whisper

  yes replied quenden it gets
into my nose and it is all i can do to
keep from sneezing

  do you know what that means
asked trenton

  what-my sneezing or the dust
asked quenden

   the dust replied the astronaut it
 suggests the fact that the moon pirates
 are unaware ofthis hidden passages ex-
 istence  they wont know where to
 look ior us this layer of dust is the
 accumulation of many years and it has
 lain here undisturbed through the fact
 that the moon pirates never come into
 this secret tunnel
moon pirates



  then we have escaped from them
exclaimed quenden

  for the time being replied tren-
ton

  lets see where it will take tis said
sorelle leading the way onward through
the passage whose rocky floor lay coated
with the dust

  finally the three men reached the
end of the long tunnel which it would
seem had led them several hundred feet
away from their prison quarters

  another secret door echoed so-
relle in a hoarse whisper as he pointed
to the extremity of the tunnel

  sh-h-h remonstrated trenton
holding up a finger to his lips for si-
lence i hear voices

  and sure eough from beyond the se-
cret wall panel there came the sound of
voices in conversation the three pris-
oners of the moon pirates leaned up
against the panel and listened eagerly

  some of the pirates whispered so-
relle as he caught the gist of their con-
versation

  what are they talking about asked
quenden

  i cant quite make out replied bret
sorelle but from the sound of the
voices i should say there were three or
four of them in there

  presently the voices died down and
dwindled away

  they have gone said quenden

  lets go in suggested trenton

  sure replied sorelle if you think
it safe to take a chance

  well try it said the young astro-
naut as he pulled upon the panelling
which separated the secret tunnel and
the next room

  go carefully admonished quenden

  slowly jan trenton drew the section
of wall inward and the three gazed into
he room temporarily devoid of human
presence

  look directed the astronaut his

eyes glistening as he pointed out to his
companions several objects which lay
upon the table in the room

  atom pistols ejaculated sorelle

  with a light catlike bound jan
trenton had leaped down from the
opening and was followed by sorelle
and quenden the three captives seizing
the coveted weapons

  now i feel better said trenton

  a-ha-a grinned sorelle as he
clutched one of the guns in his right
hand this is more like it now
maybe well have something to say about
whether or not we become moon pi-
rates 

  all three were delighted at their good
fortune and did not notice the sound of
approaching footsteps until there ap-
peared in the doorway leading from the
chamber one of the moon pirates whose
startled eyes took in the scene before
him his hands leaped to the atom pis-
tol at his side but quenden who was
the first to see him beat him to the
draw already having the pistol in his
hand and with a muffled gasp the pi-
rate sank to the floor

  thats for bronson said quenden
mentioning the name of one of his dead
comrades who had been shot from the
large atom gun aboard the jolly roger
we have got one of the scoundrels to
our credit anyway

  we have one desperate chance in
our power exclaimed the young astro-
naut excitedly we must fight our way
to a broadcaster and radio the earth
for help

  good enough agreed sorelle en-
thusiastically it is our one chance
and we must lose no time

  with atom guns clutched firmly in
their hands the three desperate men
proceeded stealthily along the corridor
leading from the room they had just
quitted

  wait a minute said trenton we


amazing stories

had better put that fellow you just killed
out of sight more can be accomplished
by strategy than by a show of arms
put him in the secret tunnel sug-
gested quenden

  the three hastily reentered the room
and taking the body of the moon pirate
they placed it just inside the secret pas-
sage and closed the door

  that takes care of him said the
young astronaut as the three proceeded
on their way once more

  have you any idea where we are
going queried sorelle

  no replied trenton we shall
just have to trust to luck

  from the bend ahead they heard
footsteps approaching

  the pirates exclaimed sorelle
shall we drill them

  theres too many from the sound
said trenton we had better hide and
let them go past or the noise will bring
the whole crowd down around our
ears

  in here hissed quenden motion-
ing them to a small room leading off the
corridor quick

  they ducked out of sight just in time
before several of the pirates appeared
around the bend hulan the human
robot was among them

a close shave commented sorelle
or a gun duel added trenton i
wish i knew where they kept their
broadcaster they must have one some-
where 

  the three members of the inter-
planetary limited who had fallen into
the evil hands of the space buccaneers
continued their way turning the bend
in the passage and heading rapidly for
a room at the far end on tiptoe they
approached the doorway of the chamber
and soon they heard voices

  well how do you feel now spoke
a smooth oily voice which tickled their
memory with its peculiar enunciation

you must admit that hulan is a ge-
nius

  he is a devil came the weak reply
oh put me out of my misery i im-
plore you

  then followed a groan of pain and
anguish as only the damned in hell might
emit followed by a harsh wicked
laugh

  kill me kill me continued the
weak voice in pleading accents

  clarkford exclaimed trenton as
he heard the tortured accents of the
man for the second time

  and the other one sounds like bal-
four said quenden

  you mean zind corrected sorelle
theres no one else in there from what
i can hear-lets rescue clarkford

  the three broke into the room atom
pistols ready for immediate use

  confronting them was the most hor-
rible scene they had ever witnessed or
would ever be called upon to see a
scene which was to be stamped vividly
upon their memory in graphic detail for
the remainder of their lives

  unwittingly they had stumbled upon
the laboratory of nez hulan and be-
fore their eyes lay a most terrible un-
nerving spectacle of such hideous char-
acter as civilized man is seldom called
upon to witness upon a supporting
standard above a complicated array of
attached tubes wires and other intricate
apparatus the decapitated head of j c
clarkford rested an expression of in-
tense pain and horror lay upon his coun-
tenance  a short distance from the
head across the room and facing it was
the body of the man whose arms and
legs still moved at the commands of the
brain which was hooked up in com-
munication with the head by the system
of tubes and wires which ran from the
apparatus surrounding the head to the
various portions of the body

  standing before the gruesome handi-
moon pirates



work of the inhuman genius of hulan
stood zind apparently enjoying the hor-
rifying scene the dark-skinned pirate
turned from his pleasure of taunting the
head as he heard the entrance of the
three men from the space limited who
had been taken captives by the murder-
ous crew an ugly scowl spreading over
his features at the sight of them the
horror of the thing struck trenton so-
relle and quenden dumb for the brief
moment in which zind was overcome by
their sudden unexpected appearance
even the head stared in surprise

  what are you doing here growled
zind his dark face glaring in evil hatred
at them as his hand slowly crept to the
suspicious bulge of a gun butt at his
side

  take your hand away from that
atom pistol or youll never know
snapped the astronaut covering the
olive skinned spy of the moon pirates
with the menacing muzzle of his gun
now tell us where there is a broad-
caster or well shoot you so full of
holes you can pass for the proverbial
swiss cheese of yore

  youll die for this hissed zind
his lips curling in a sneer a long slow
death under the tiny ray

  shut up you dirty dog came the
sharp command from sorelle who ap-
proached and shoved his weapon against
the mans ribs if we do die that way
you wont be there to see us go now
speak up and tell us where that broad-
caster is located or it is death for you
oh kill me put me out of my
agony  save my daughter whispered
the head faintly you trenton will
do it for me wont you shoot me
quick in the head-destroy my body
how long have you been like this
asked the young astronaut addressing
the head

  when hulan got me here i lost my
senses when i came to myself an hour

ago i found myself as you see me-

looking across the room at my own
body spoke the head in low dismal
tones it isnt the pain so much it is
some terrible feeling i cant explain-
it is unworldly like something never be-
fore experienced in human ken it is a
terrible sensation i must die i must
it is seizing me-its on my head if
you ever valued my friendship kill me
trenton it is the most merciful thing
you can do

  the three men forgetting zind for a
moment stared aghast at the words ut-
tered through the lips of clarkfords
head which had apparently been severed
at the junction of the neck and chest

  watch out sorelle yelled quenden
snapping his gun into position and firing
from the hip zind in the space of the
few seconds in which the attention of
the three had been diverted to the de-
capitated man had raised a large heavy
instrument above the head of the ad-
venturer

  a silent blue streak spit from the
muzzle of quendens atom gun and for
the second time since their escape the
sniping prowess of the man claimed the
life of a moon pirate

  thats for brekstadt announced
quenden coolly naming the second
members of the limiteds crew who had
been consigned to the huge atom gun
aboard the jolly roger

  the radio you say queried clark-
fords voice weakly while the hands of
the decapitated body stirred in a char-
acteristic gesture of query it is in
the private quarters of carconte-i
heard hulan say so my daughter is
there-save her kill me-that awful
feeling-it isnt pain-it is indescrib-
able

  there followed a groan from between
the lips and the body of the man
writhed in an attempt to get away from
something


amazing stories

  well have to do it announced so-
relle to his two reluctant comrades it
is the only thing to be done he cant
be saved we must act before hulan
comes back with the rest of the gang
too

  it is horrible-but i guess it is
necessary agreed trenton

  yes kill me implored the head of
clarkford- please dont leave me to
suffer like this dont leave my body
intact for that beast to work on either
destroy it

  good-bye clarkford spoke sorelle
in a choking voice

  ill get hulan for you swore the
avenging quenden

  and if your daughter isnt dead ill
save her promised jan trenton car-
conte shall die

  farewell smiled clarkford as he
saw the pistols of the three slowly and
reluctantly raised to point at his head
ill meet you all some time in another
existence beyond the plane of the three
worlds

  with a simultaneous succession of
blue flashes from each of the three
guns the decapitated head of clarkford
disappeared from view leaving but a
few fragmentary remains the three
men turned their attention to the body
which was likewise riddled beyond prac-
tical use for experiment in the labora-
tory

chapter ix
the duel to death

tt there now asked quenden

  f after the loathsome business
    had been completed

  to the apartment of carconte and
death to every miserable pirate who
shows his face announced jan tren-
ton

  where are carcontes rooms asked
sorelle

  thats something we must find out
said trenton come on

  the three passed out of the labora-
tory of nez hulan and into the passage
once more cautioning his two com-
rades with a remonstrating gesture for
silence the astronaut sneaked ahead of
them along the corridor with the stealth
of a cat sorelle and quenden were
perplexed for a moment at this strange
maneuver until ahead of them they saw
a moon pirate who with back toward
them was busily engaged in some item
of work or preoccupation the first he
knew of their presence was when a pair
of strong fingers closed over his throat
choking off the cry which instinctively
issued from his lungs turned roughly
about the moon buccaneers startled
gaze rested upon jan trenton

  one peep out of you and ill wring
your neck off threatened the astro-
naut

  a dose of the pistol for you too if
you dont tell us where carcontes
rooms are located added sorelle who
had come up beside the two poking his
atom gun against the head of the fright-
ened moon pirate significantly

  there-that way directed the buc-
caneer his bulging eyes rolling fearfully
in the direction of the menacing pistol
whose cold muzzle rested against his
temple

  lead us there ordered trenton

  the mans obedient efforts to comply
with their wishes was ludicrous evi-
dently life was precious to the rascal
he led them along the corridor in the
direction of his chieftains quarters
even admonishing them to be silent the
boring muzzle of sorelles gun carried a
great deal of persuasion and left no
doubt within the mind of the lunar buc-
caneer as to what he should do down
the corridor and through several rooms
-the moon pirate led them finally
showing a doorway down a low hall
moon pirates



  there carcontes rooms are and the
woman you seek is doubtless there too
stated the pirate

  well go on said sorelle

  no-id much prefer you to kill me
than to be ushered into the presence of
carconte you saw what happened to the
traitor whom hulan tortured to death in
the council chamber that would be
my fate were i to be found leading you
here

  but you have no other choice
agreed sorelle tapping the pistol sug-
gestively carconte would realize
that

  death is my other choice replied
the pirate who though terror stricken
at the fate which awaited him should
sorelles fingers close upon the knob of
the gun preferred such an end to the
horrible death awaiting him at the hands
of nez hulan

  i can aid you no further he main-
tained obstinately you must continue
alone

  while you sound the alarm coun-
tered trenton

  no-i promise replied the pirate
to do so would reveal the fact that i
had brought you this far and even my
calling to arms the rest of my comrades
might not exonerate me before the eyes
of hulan and carconte-and they as
you already know are not men to be
trifled with

  let him go said sorelle even if
i dont trust him his logic is sound
enough-and besides he would only be
an encumbrance upon our hands well
have to chance it

  skip ordered trenton to the moon
pirate who hastily complied with the
curt request disappearing from sight
around the bend in the corridor

  hurry up urged the young astro-
naut after all we cant tell what the
man may do

  they pressed on towards the apart-

ment of the pirate leader and outside
the doorway to the first room they lis-
tened for voices they heard none and
peeping around the doorway trenton
perceived that the room was deserted
come on-the way is clear

  his two companions followed him
through the room and into the next

  where is the girl and the broad-
caster queried sorelle

  that villain deceived us exclaimed
quenden vehemently probably he is
bringing the rest of them here to inni-
hilate us by now

  where do you sup-

  the words of trenton were cut short
by the piercing scream of a woman
coming from the direction of the door-
way leading farther into the apartments
of carconte

  without a moments hesitation the
three raced swiftly through a succes-
sion of luxuriously furnished rooms
examining each one with a cursory
searching glance before proceeding to
the next ahead of them they heard
the sounds of a struggle and to their
ears came the deep vulgar tones of car-
conte

  you vixen-you miserable wench
so you would try to cheat me by de-
stroying yourself well you cant do
it now because i took that poison away
from you even though i nearly twisted
your pretty arm off to do it just for
that ill take you to see your father i
was going to spare you the sight but
now you will be forced to look hulan
has him ready to receive company

  a coarse vibrant laugh followed the
last remark of carconte and then the
three men of the space ship limited
broke into the room cutting short the
laugh of the bald headed pirate who
held the fainting girl by the wrist sur-
prise anger and hate mantled his face
as he saw who the three men were nor
did he wait for explanation but leaped


amazing stories

across the room to where his atom gun
lay upon the table

  the pistol of sorelle silently spat fire
and with a terrible curse which wrin-
kled his villainous face in a hideous
grimace he shook his left arm which
dangled limply from the effects of so-
relles shot staggering up against the
wall the pirate chief pressed a button
and from the ceiling to the floor divid-
ing the room in half there shot a close
set formation of the deep violet shafts
of light which had barred the doorway
of their cell upon the pirate space craft
upon one side stood carconte holding
his injured arm the fainting girl at his
elbow while upon the other side of the
deadly screen stood the astronaut ad-
venturer and the crew member of the
interplanetary limited

  dont walk through that shrilled
ouenden warningly remember what
happened to crayton

  trentons eyes blazed furiously and
his atom pistol streaked forth its blue
flashes in rapid succession at the leer-
ing pirate who stood behind the curtain
of deadly transparent rays in spite of
the pain in his arm carconte could not
repress a guffaw of laughter as the as-
tronaut fired shot after shot futilely at
him through the curtain of violet light
which nullified the destroying forces of
the atom gun

  its no use firing at him  advised
sorelle we must find another way of
getting across to that other side of the
room

  if i cant get over there said
quenden i know what can

  quickly he raised a heavy chair and
balancing it upon his shoulders cast it
across the room through the veil of
deadly rays at the pirate chief who was
running for a doorway leading from his
side of the chamber the chair caught
him on the side of the head and down
he crashed to the floor

  good ejaculated sorelle but
that doesnt help us in getting across
there

  watch directed quenden a spar-
kle of anticipation in his eye as he
picked up another piece of furniture

  straight for the other wall he threw
it right through the curtain of death it
went following the route of the chair
and smashing against the knob on the
wall the shaft of violet light disp-
peared and the three rushed across the
room trenton lifting suzette clarkford
tenderly in his arms she was begin-
ning to recover her consciousness

  we must get out of here cried so-
relle i hear the pirates coming

  and indeed they were coming a rush
of many footsteps approaching the
room in which stood the three men and
the girl from the interplanetary limited

  we must get to the radio whis-
pered trenton

  it is in one of the rooms we passed
through exclaimed quenden excitedly
motioning for them to follow him i
saw it when we were coming here

  trenton bearing the girl in his arms
followed quenden while sorelle brought
up the rear guarding them from an at-
tack in that direction

  well hold them off while you are
using the broadcaster said sorelle to
jan trenton

  to the room in which quenden had
seen the broadcaster they continued the
running footsteps and excited yells and
cries of the moon pirates growing
rapidly louder



  into the council chamber where the
four men sat in conference at new
york city the greatest metropolis on
three worlds there burst an excited man

  the limited has been captured and
destroyed by the moon pirates shouted
the man breathlessly
moon pirates



  the moon pirates who are they
questioned one of the officials blankly
surprised

  thieves space robbers exclaimed
the man excitedly they have captured
the limited destroyed it took the
treasure killed part of the crew and its
passengers and the rest of them are in
captivity upon the moon at this mo-
ment they are fighting for their lives
how do you know this 

  they just radioed from the moon
having escaped from the moon pirates
long enough to send the message for
help

  we must send them assistance im-
mediately said one

  a swarm of fighting space craft is
already on its way to the moon having
started ten minutes ago announced the
informant they should be half way
there by now

  moon pirates echoed the head offi-
cial can it be possible

  it explains the strange disappear-
ance of all the space craft within the
last few years

  i remember reading of pirates in the
olden days way back in the past sev-
eral centuries ago but these roved the
seas of the earth to loot and murder
among the sailing vessels

  while nowadays the moon pirates
cruise the seas of space to rob and de-
stroy space flyers

  how could they have existed upon
the moon so long without having been
discovered it seems that the informa-
tion should have leaked out some way
discipline and strict secrecy ex-
plained one of the officials and they
probably have a clever master-mind at
the head of the group i wonder how
many their ranks number

  who sent the broadcast queried
one of the officials and from what sec-
tion of the moon did it come

  jan trenton stood before the broad-

caster said the man and behind him
stood two men and a girl a pale hag-
gard look rested upon her face and they
were all excited and dishevelled replied
the man i was at the receiving room
when the flash came from the moon
ive forgotten the exact spot they gave
it was somewhere upon the other side
of the moon and they scarcely knew
themselves and were able to give only
an approximate estimate of their loca-
tion

  jan trenton exclaimed the official
you probably all remember him and
his narrow escape from death on mars
when his space flyer became caught on
the side of a meteor which plunged
headlong toward the martian planet
yes it seems that the meteor closely
resembled a deaths head

  the deaths head meteor they
called it

  there must be four survivors-one
of them a woman

  j c clarkfords daughter

  lets hope the rescue ships arrive in
time

  in the meanwhile lets tune in upon
one of the fighting craft we can ob-
tain an accurate broadcast of the events
as they transpire



  at the door of the broadcasting room
within range of the television screen
stood quenden and sorelle guarding
against an overwhelming invasion of the
moon pirates while the astronaut de-
livered his message to the earth which
rotated nearly a quarter million miles
away in space from out of the bowels
of the dead satellite across the cosmic
void to the largest of the three planets
the voice of jan trenton rang clear to
throw into furore excitement and con-
cern the population of a world the news
to be later relayed to venus and mars

  the guns of the two who were guard-
ing the door spit silently as the van-


amazing stories

guard of the moon pirates came into
view they had discovered their fallen
leader who had been stunned from the
blow delivered him by the chair quen-
den had hurled it with marked success
before they could check their advance
and make a retreat two of the pirates
had given up their lives to the marks-
manship of sorelle and quenden and
then the moon pirates craftily betook
themselves to advantageous positions
where they could fire at the little group
with the maximum safety to themselves

  hurry up with that broadcast
urged sorelle we cant hold them off
much longer the devils are sneaking
up on us

  all done said trenton snapping
off the broadcaster

  did it get them asked the girl

  yes he replied and now we had
better get out of here before some of
the pirates block us off from the other
side

  where shall we go asked quen-
den

  somewhere where we can barricade
ourselves and hold them oft until help
arrives

  swiftly the four of them ran through
the succession of rooms which consti-
tuted carcontes private apartments
trenton assisting the girl

  wait a minute shouted sorelle as
they passed a doorway

  the adventurer pressed a knob upon
the wall and down across the doorway
there spread a thin veil of the violet
shafts of life destroying light

  that will hold them for a while he
said it will give us a start

  once more they continued their way
running into three of the lunar bucca-
neers as they made a sharp turn in the
corridor

  halt yelled one of the moon pi-
rates surprised at the sudden appear-
ance of the four fugitives

  brentley exclaimed trenton rec-
ognizing the co-pilot of the interplane-
tary limited who had turned pirate
rather than forfeit his life or undergo a
brain operation

  canute and holmes ejaculated
quenden also recognizing his fellow
crew members who had gone over to
the ranks of the moon pirates rather
than risk the chances of being con-
signed to the atom gun or a worse fate

  we must return you to carconte
said brentley coming out of his sud-
den surprise we are moon pirates
now you know

  in body but not in spirit laughed
trenton nervously as his atom gun
covered the co-pilot i have radioed
the earth for help they are sending a
fleet of fighting craft are you with us
or must we fight it out here

  brentley and his two companions con-
sidered for a moment possibly ruminat-
ing as to the outcome of the affair wish-
ing to be upon the winning side

  how do you know they are com-
ing asked brentley suspiciously

  because i just radioed them re-
plied the young astronaut

  im willing to join forces with you
decided brentley what do you say
holmes 

  wed better replied holmes

  and you canute

  im with the majority announced
canute wed better dig for safety at
once theyre coming

  a howl of rage greeted their ears as
the pirates were halted at the doorway
of the chamber where the violet rays of
light blocked their further progress
making it necessary for them to retrace
their steps a considerable distance
through the labyrinth of rooms and cor-
ridors in a detour of the fatal shafts of
deep violet light

  come said brentley i know where
we can maintain our best stand
moon pirates



  the little band of fugitives whose
ranks had been increased to seven now
raced at top speed through the subter-
ranean chambers of the moon finally
reaching a room which boasted heavy
massive doors of metal

  in here announced brentley lead-
ing the way there are loopholes in
the door from which to fire

  good said sorelle as the seven
fugitives took refuge within the cham-
ber barring shut the heavy doors

  they awaited the coming of the moon
pirates atomic pistols directed through
the loopholes in readiness for the attack
which was to come

  where is my father asked the girl
of jan trenton

  the space ship pilot with a troubled
look upon his face sought vainly in his
mind for some way to explain the man-
ner in which clarkford had met his end
without shocking the girl with the hor-
rible truth

  is he dead she asked

  yes replied trenton his voice
sinking to a whisper it was better so
rather than to have lived to endure the
fate hulan had in store for him when
we arrived he was beyond rescue and
at his own request we did that which
was most merciful

  the girl broke down and sobbed des-
pairingly her heart torn with grief
while the young astronaut did the best
he could to comfort her finally she
gained control of herself so that she
could speak coherently

  he was all i had left she said
my mother died seven years ago
here they come cried sorelle
let them have it

  the moon pirates were repulsed suf-
fering the loss of only one man and
then followed a gun duel of pot shots
taken at one another neither side scor-
ing any hits due to the fact that both
factions were overcautious this satis-

fied the group of fugitives for they
were only stalling for time

  were sunk exclaimed holmes
suddenly look what theyve got

  the ray gun exclaimed quenden

  theyre turning it on the door 
cried sorelle

  quick out this other door said
brentley we cant stay here any
longer

  and it was true already several
large holes appeared in the heavy metal
door as the destructive ray penetrated
their stronghold firing a few parting
shots they prepared to leave by way of
the other door as brentley swung it
open the fugitives gave a gasp of dis-
may at the sight they beheld standing
silently outside awaiting just such a
move upon the part of the fugitives
stood the pale countenanced nez hulan
the human robot a grim cruel smile
distorting his death-like features below
the aluminum cranium and forehead
with him were three more of the moon
pirates he levelled a steel arm at
brentley in a denunciatory manner

  so we have another traitor-and so
soon he rasped

  from the metal palm of his hand
there shot a yellow ray of light which
burned a clean-cut hole clear through
the chest of brentley who fell choking
gasping and bleeding in a lifeless heap
upon the floor it had all occurred so
quickly brentley being the first to
emerge from the room that the fugi-
tives had hardly gotten over their sud-
den surprise before the co-pilot lay dead
at their feet from the terrible destroy-
ing ray which had shot from out of the
mechanical arm of the ruthless machine
man

  that is what happens to all traitors
or enemies of the moon pirates
sneered hulan

  and to human devils cried quen-
den his atom pistol flashing forth sev-


amazing stories

eral times in quick succession at the
arch-villain of the moon pirates

  a dull blank look overspread the
crafty features of hulan as with me-
chanical arms he gripped his vitals
where the shots from the atomic pistol
had taken effect and swaying weakly he
tottered and fell dead for the second
time in his career this time irrepara-
bly so

  thats for clarkford shouted
quenden exultantly as several shots
from the moon pirates entered his own
body

  quenden swayed slightly as death
crept over him but as he fell his spit-
ting pistol claimed the lives of two more
of the space buccaneers and he died
bravely fighting to the last his inani-
mate form slumped across the dead
form of the man he had sworn to kill
the mechanical-limbed demon who had
been recalled to life without a soul

  a single moon pirate blocked their
progress and a shot from sorelles gun
disposed of the remaining buccaneer

  get out of here quick before some
more of them come cried sorelle to
those who crowded the doorway

  the five remaining fugitives left the
room which the moon pirates were
about to enter via the other doorway
having cut the metal door to pieces with
the ray gun down the corridor they
sped entering another room

  the elevator exclaimed canute ex-
citedly the surface suits are above
we can escape to the surface of the
moon there are two elevators one
with an air lock at the foot of the shaft
while this one has an air lock at the
top

  pile into the car exclaimed tren-
ton ill hold off the pirates until you
get it started

  the buccaneers in the meanwhile
under the leadership of carconte had
entered the chamber just quitted by

their recent captives and had discovered
the bodies of hulan and their men as
well as those of brentley and quenden
on they came down the corridor to-
wards the room in which the five re-
maining crew and passengers of the
space ship were attempting to escape to
the surface the loud voice of car-
conte urged on his men with vile threats
and foul language bemoaning the loss
of hulans brain power

  the blue streak from jan trentons
pistol halted the rush of the moon pi-
rates who discreetly halted not one of
them wishing to sacrifice himself that
the rest might accomplish the subjec-
tion of their late prisoners in the ele-
vator car the rest of the fugitives at-
tempted to solve the problem of the ele-
vators locomotion its operation being
based on radical principles evolved by
hulan the astronaut held off the moon
pirates finally sorelle found the
means by which the car was made to
ascend or descend and with a jerk the
car started upward only to be checked
by the adventurer who called to the
astronaut to get in

chapter x

the earth ships

jan trenton leaped into the
elevator car which began to climb
upward while behind him the vil-
lainous band of space buccaneers under
the command of the dark visaged car-
conte whose bald head bore a deep
bruise rushed down upon the elevator
lobby just in time to see the bottom of
the car disappearing out of sight above
them

  rapidly the car ascended bearing the
four men and girl toward the surface

  where does this thing stop asked
sorelle

  there are some upper chambers with
an air lock and surface suits up here
some place said holmes
moon pirates



  the elevator car continued onward
gaining speed and acceleration of its
own mechanism finally it slowed to a
stop and the fleeing fugitives stepped
out into the room in which the moon
surface suits hung in a neat row upon
their hangers

   ive worn this sort of thing before
said sorelle

  so have i remarked the astronaut
but not under such pressing circum-
stances as these

  the five hastily donned the surface
suits trenton assisting the girl into one
of the clumsy accoutrements with its
huge helmet and then they entered the
air-lock chamber after which they made
their way along the narrow tunnel lead-
ing upward on a gradual ascent bring-
ing them to the platform deep within
the moon crater

  looking upward they could perceive
the mysterious grandeur of the dazzling
sunlight where it struck the ragged lip
of the crater throwing into relief a
chaos of illuminated spots and sharp
etched shadows

  climb upward directed the astro-
naut pointing to the ladder which ran
up the side of the crater the girl
will follow you i will come last

  up through the blackness towards the
sunlit crags of the moon craters rugged
lip the five fugitives climbed to escape
the wrath of the avenging buccaneers of
the lunar satellite

  im dizzy complained the girl
through the radiophone in her helmet to
the astronaut below her my head
feels light and i must cling tight or i
shall fall

  it is the sudden change from the
gravity of the earth to that of the
moon replied trenton while we
were in the moon chambers of the pi-
rates we were under the same attraction
of gravity as on the earth the floors of
the rooms being composed of the same

gravitational substance we use in the
space flyer the sensation will soon
wear off when your body becomes a lit-
tle more accustomed to the sudden re-
duction of gravity you have never
been on the surface of the moon before
have you

  no replied the girl

  you should visit phobos and
deimos some time said the young
astronaut trying to divert the girls
mind from the seriousness of their pres-
ent situation by referring to the two
tiny satellites of mars if you give too
hard a jump upon deimos youll never
come back but will continue right off
into space

  ever upward they continued their as-
cent finally emerging into the brilliant
sunlight upon the crater lip which over-
looked the dreary funereal aspect of the
moons surface it was a weird beauti-
ful panorama of melancholy loneliness
which stretched away to the horizon
whose sharp cut features stood out
clearly where it met the blackness of
space studded with its fiery scintillat-
ing galaxy of far-off suns and worlds
at another time the five fugitives would
have stood spellbound at the sight mo-
mentarily entranced by the scene spread
out before them but they were gam-
bling with death their lives being at
stake

  between here and the earth help is
supposed to be on the way said so-
relle i hope they arrive in time

  its curtains for us if they dont
ejaculated holmes lets dig for shel-
ter the pirates will be after us if we
stay here

  in wide jumps and awkward hops
the five began their descent of the rise
which led to the craters edge the girl
unaccustomed to moon travel by foot
landed in an ungainly heap upon her
side after having leaped some twenty
feet or more into the air in an effort to


amazing stories

clear an obstructing protrusion of rock
about five feet high a startled shriek
rang in the ears of the four men as the
girl started rolling and bouncing to-
wards the edge of a deep crevice which
yawned below theml with a headlong
leap jan trenton seized the girl upon
the very brink of the unterminable
abyss unable to check his impetus in
order to halt his and the girls fall into
the lunar crevice he gave an added push
with his feet in a superhuman effort to
bridge the awful gap with his human
burden the other de of the gulf rep-
resented a jump of some thirty feet
which the astronaut ordinarily would have
consummated with ease but with the
added weight of the girl it was a different
matter across the unknown depths of
the gulf the bodies of the two shot while
their three companions held their breath
in horror would they make it

  upon the verge of the ragged pit jan
trenton unable to check his headlong
flight had put every ounce of strength
into that push which now carried the
two out over the moon crevice his
free arm stretched outward as he saw
that they were going to fall short of the
other side the claws at the extremity
of the arms in the surface suit were
ready to grasp frantically at the small-
est protuberance which might save them
from the jaws of death which awaited in
the semblance of the jagged rocks of
the gloomy pits bottom far below
they struck the opposite wall of the
wide crevice several feet below the top
ridge jan trenton clinging desperately
to the rough surface with one arm and
hand with the other arm he grasped
the girl firmly once more the ancient
proverb of fortune favors the brave
had justified itself for the astronaut had
grasped at a rough outcropping which
firmly checked their further descent it
took but i slight inertia for them to
leap up over the edge of the pits mouth

  you have done so much for me al-
ready and now i owe you my life said
the girl how can i ever repay you
by taking my hand and allowing me
to assist you over the more dangerous
stretches of the moons surface said
t renton

  the other three now leaped over the
deep abyss which had nearly claimed the
lives of their two companions and were
at their sides

  we must find a place of refuge in
which to hide until the space ships from
the earth arrive said sorelle

  they should be here by now re-
plied the astronaut perhaps they are
looking for us i was unable to give
them a very accurate estimate of our
location i noticed that the spot where
we descended into the crater is not a
very great distance from the grisenwald
mountains and that was the only clue as
to our location i could give them

   theres the place to hide until they
come exclaimed canute see that
peak-it appears to be hollow

  good enough said trenton start-
ing for the designated peak in company
with the girl to whose arm he clung
guarding her from the dangers which
threatened the uninitiated who at-
tempted moon travel for the first time

  rapidly the five ascended the steep
grade in long hops and leaps which
would have appeared prodigious upon
the earth the spiked shoes of their sur-
face suits gripping the crags of the
slope securely

  there they come wailed holmes
just before the five fugitives succeeded
in gaining the sanctuary of the peak

  looking behind them jan trenton
saw two men in surface suits standing
upon the lip of the moon crater which
led to the rendezvous of the lunar buc-
caneers while several more were join-
ing them from the interior excitedly
they pointed to their recent prisoners
moon piralls



of the interplanetary limited who were
just disappearang within the shallow
cavity of the peak they had climbed

  several of them raised their atom
pistols and fired-at a distance of some
five hundred feet or more without a
sound canute stiffened and pitched
backward his lifeless body rolling into
a rough formation of calcareous out-
growth where it lodged firmly between
two rocky protuberances

  trenton sorelle and holmes hurried
into the protecting hollow of the emi-
nence the astronaut conducting the girl
to safety

  the three men then removed their
atom pistols from the pockets of the
surface suits where they had placed them
before attempting the arduous ascent of
the long ladder out of the crater awk-
wardly they attempted the manipulation
of the guns with the ungainly steel
claws which terminated the arms of the
surface suits

  how do you work these guns with
the claws queried holmes

  i guess you dont replied sorelle
but the pirates seem to operate them
without trouble they shot one of us

  ive got it exclaimed jan trenton
who had been examining the extremities
of the arms in his surface suit you
dont need to hold atom guns in these
claws-there are atom guns in the right
arm of each suit they are built-in
affairs

  well ill be- exploded sorelle as
he stared amazed at the small muzzle
which protruded a short distance from
the arm of his surface suit being located
between the steel claws how do you
fire them

  with that little button inside your
sleeve just above the claw controls
replied trenton

  sorelle needed no more instructions
but was soon firing away at the pirates
who stood boldly in plain sight upon

the craters rim one of them toppled
backward into the depths of the lunar
pit before the rest discreetly hid them-
selves behind rough outcroppings of
jagged rock then ensued a duel in
which no more lives were claimed con-
sisting of a game of fire and duck the
blue flashes from behind the rocks of
the dead satellite marking the positions
of the moon pirates

  theyre sneaking up on us an-
nounced holmes

  thats all right replied the young
astronaut they can get to the foot of
this rise and no farther we can hold
them off a long time if they try to rush
us well mow them down

  anxiously the young astronaut scanned
the star-lit sky in which the sun shone
like a flaming sphere its corona leaping
outward from the incandescent mass for
several hundred thousand miles where
were the rescue ships from the planet
which rolled on its way nearly a quarter
million miles away from the other side
of the moon why didnt they come
they were nowhere in sight

  the pirates are coming closer an-
nounced suzette clarkford

  they can come no farther said jan
trenton there are no more barriers
behind which they can hide to come
any nearer they must show themselves
were doomed yelled holmes
there isnt a chance for us now

  the man pointed to a great black
object which was rising slowly out of
the moon crater which led to the sub-
terranean chambers where dwelt the
rascally brigands of space who robbed
and destroyed upon the interplanetary
highways between worlds

  the pirate space ship swore bret
sorelle were trapped like rats

  the black hulk of the jolly roger
its white skull and cross bones glaring
menacingly at the four survivors of the
interplanetary limited crept up out of


amazing stories

the crater slowly it arose above the
ragged edges of the craters rim until
it rode high over the jagged formations
which lined the circle of the lunar cone
its ghastly yellow disintegrator ray now
shone dismally from beneath the hull of
the pirate space ship as it headed for
the doomed men and girl

  with a yell of fright holmes leaped
over the edge of the cup-like depression
of the rocky peak which held the four
remaining fugitives while he was still
in the air on his first leap a dozen shots
from the atom guns of the pirates hidden
upon the moon surface found their mark
on his body and when he landed his
inanimate form rolled limply down the
side of the hill and out of sight into a
narrow cleft at the foot

  tensely the two men and the girl
awaited the ray which would send them
into oblivion as the space ship hovered
near them it was evident that from the
attempts to shoot them down the pirates
were bent on destroying them and even
had they been given the opportunity to
have surrendered they would have
fought to the death preferring such a
welcome end rather than that which lay
in store for them at the hands of the
moon pirates

  suzette snuggled comfortably within
the protecting arms of jan trenton

  good-by she said you have been
so brave and good would it be a com-
fort to you before you die to know that
i love you

  you love me cried the young
astronaut looking through the trans-
parent front of their helmets down into
her sweet face joyfully oblivious to the
approaching doom which hovered ever
nearer granting them a love of but a
moment before the destructive ray should
sweep them into the arms of death

  yes replied the girl even when
i first met you and my regard for you
has grown ever since then

   ive known you scarcely any time yet
it seems ages answered the young as-
tronaut i didnt dare to love you when
i first saw you even though my heart
cried out for you because i thought
you were beyond my reach

   love is greater than all else said
the girl nestling closer to the space ship
pilot it can overcome everything-even
death

   i wonder mused the astronaut as he
gazed above to where the ugly space
ship hovered above them its ray sweep-
ing gradually up the side of the rise

   well we three held them off together
until the end exclaimed sorelle in
farewell see you later

  as the deathly shaft of yellow de-
struction came stealing to the edge of
their stronghold jan trenton hid the
face of the girl by turning the front of
her helmet against the chest of his sur-
face suit while he lowered his head
upon her helmet would the love this life
had so cruelly denied him be his beyond
the pales of death would she be there
with him or must he fight his way
through more adventures to her side
upon another plane of existence she
would be his-of that he was certain-
no matter where they were

   a hoarse yell from sorelle greeted his
ears interrupting the closing reveries
of his life doubtless the ray had struck
the brave adventurer before it had them
and this was his dying cry someone
shook him vigorously he looked up

   were saved howled sorelle jump
ing with glee so high above the hollow
interior of the peak that it would seem
he was never coming down look at
the dirty beggars run will you and
look over there

   sorelle pointed excitedly at the figures
of the besieging moon pirates who were
running confusedly in all directions from
their points of vantage where they had
cornered the fugitives and then his
moon pirates



arm swept over to a sight which the
astounded eyes of jan trenton could
hardly believe there lay the wreck of
the jolly roger its sides smashed in
upon the surface of the moon while
above it rode several space ships more
of them appearing rapidly out of the
cosmic void

   the earth ships  cried the young
astronaut they have come-just in the
nick of time

   the bewildered eyes of the girl took
in the startling scene

   it seems unreal she said as if i
were dreaming this can it be possible
ill pinch you if you wish an-
nounced sorelle joyfully

   we have one another now suzette
said trenton do you still mean what
you said before we were going to die
why of course answered the girl
her pretty eyes sparkling with love
from behind the transparent facing of
her helmet

   then you are mine he said

  the space ships from the earth had
blown up the pirate craft just as it was
about to perpetrate its dastardly act and
destroy the three remaining fugitives
with its disintegrator ray they had
cruised about the vicinity of grisenwald
mountain far above the moon the tele-
scopes of the fighting space ships search-
ing for some sign of the moon pirates
rendezvous and then they had spied the
moon pirates swarming out of the crater
followed by the pirate ship a long range
shot had destroyed the black craft with
its hateful emblem with the pirate
ship hovering above them as it exploded
and the appearance of the fleet of armed
interplanetary ships from the earth the
besieging moon pirates ran for cover
within their underground stronghold

   hulan had been killed by the incom-
parable marksmanship of quenden and
quenden had immediately after suc-
cumbed to the shots of the other moon

pirates who had riddled him zind had
also met his death at the hands of the
avenging sniper while carconte the
pirate chieftain had been present with
a large number of his crew in the jolly
roger when it had met its destruction
at the hands of the fighting craft from
the earth the rest of the moon pirates
disorganized without leaders and in
the face of such a hopeless situation
did not even attempt to escape but sur-
rendered meekly to the forces from the
earth who took them into custody their
fates to be later decided by the inter-
planetary council which resided upon
the world between the planet earth
whence all mankind had originally come

  the treasure which had been pilfered
from the interplanetary limited by the
buccaneers of space was placed in one
of the space ships from the earth to be
transported to that planet where it
would later be relayed to mars the
heterogeneous collection of space flyers
and the furnishings of the moon cham-
bers were at a later date to be confis-
cated among the three worlds and the
terrible creations of nez hulans turned
over to the scientific bureaus of the three
planets

  on one of the space ships returning to
the earth the three survivors of the grim
tragedy sat in relaxation from the series
of strenuous events and nerve wracking
escapades they had undergone

  forget it laughed sorelle you
two have each other i saw it coming on
the first time you met up in the ob-
servatory of the limited besides
ill be back in a few months no need
to ask what you folks will do

  the adventurer and explorer grinned
understanding and then noticing that
he was the only one in the room besides

the professor

when professor johann
haupt president of the
world-renowned clique
of science with its
headquarters at vien-
na in the year of  secluded himself
from the world and made his abode high
up in the tyrol mountains he not only
relinquished society and his honored posi-
tion but it seems as the years passed
that his illustrious name also faded from
the memories of his former colleagues
the mere mention of his name at one
time brought hushed attention and when
he spoke he never failed to astound those
present with the products of his brilliant
mind now after years of absence from
the scientific fireside his name scarce
aroused memory or recognition so the
world has ever been absence can make
living genius be forgotten

  perched upon the flat top of a crag
that seemed separated from a range of
peaks as if a huge wedge had been driven
into the side of the mountain and so

thrusting it aside was the isolated labora-
tory and home of professor haupt it
was a low rambling affair yet solidly
built with thick stone walls the distance
lent it a grotesque appearance it con-
formed with its foundation and its gables
were as the peak of the crag

  if professor haupts one-time friends
thought that he was enduring privations
or that his isolated habitation made soli-
tude unbearable they were sorely mis-
taken within this large and well-built
structure of stone were every modern
convenience and contrivance there was
a super-powerful radio of professor
haupts own design which enabled him
to tune into any station in the world to
this set was connected one of the remark-
able marco-tele visors that had as-
tounded the world by their perfection but
a few years ago so he never lacked for
news or the rare entertainment of view-
ing scenes of actual occurrences transpir-
ing throughout the world

  wealthy he deprived himself of noth-
ing in this retirement for reasons of his
own which will be disclosed later he

had chosen this place yet saw to it that
nothing would be lacking which made for
bodily comfort or mental advancement

  at great cost he had a circuit of high
voltage electricity connected by a cable
which led to his laboratory this power
was also used for heating besides the
hundred and one other uses for which it
is indispensable in a thoroughly-equipped
laboratory

  professor haupt had contracted with
a grocer of the village whose houses nest-
led in the verdant valley far below to
send up to him food supplies once a month
and other necessities used in his experi-
ments liberally paid for this service
the grocer saw to it that promptly on the
th of each month two husky youths
from the village made their appearance
before professor haupts door generally
heavily loaded

  so withal the professor was as com-
fortable and contented as few would have
imagined here he was unmolested in his
experiments by the visits due to curiosity
of his former hosts of friends

  his only servant a trusty old man
many years in his employ disturbed him
only to announce his meals that worthy
individual when his pots and pans his
cooking and cleaning were done would
hie himself to his quarters to indulge in
sleep or to the study to interest himself
with the radio or televisor he never ven-
tured into the laboratory except upon
professor haupts request when per-
haps some little assistance was needed

  it appeared that the time had arrived
for the professor to be helped in his
work by one he could trust

winter in all its fury of snow
and cold descended upon the little
village huddled in the deep valley of the
tyrol mountains gust after gust of win-
try blast blew down from the frozen
peaks above now obscured by the snow-
filled sky

  it was late in the afternoon when into
the deserted street of the village a soli-
tary figure made its way plodding on
the heavily-clad stranger bent himself
against the force of the descending blasts
shielding with heavy-mittened hands his
face against the driving swirling snow
that stung it mercilessly

  the inn to which the stranger was
making his way with its madly-flapping
sign was barely discernible

  his entrance was accompanied by a
shivering blast and a deluge of snow that
chilled the inns occupants quickly clos-
ing the door the stranger made his way
to a table near the glowing electric coils
and ordered hot coffee while waiting for
this he took off his ice-encrusted outer
garments and warmed himself thoroughly

  to those who were present this stran-
ger seemed a young man not over twenty-
five he was of medium height physi-
cally well-proportioned and of a pleasing
countenance if they stared at him it
was because of two remarkable things
about him one the eyes they were ex-
ceedingly dark almost black in the dim-
ness of fading day yet they sparkled like
gems upon which sudden light is thrown
in darkness second came his lips lips
that portrayed such sadness that his en-
tire features were overrun with that ex-
pression his locks of black hair that
hung forward could not try as they
would in their unmanageable state con-
ceal the lofty forehead that towered be-
hind

  some continued to stare even after the
host had arrived had served his coffee
and was taken into conversation by the
stranger however nothing could be
heard above the shrieking of the storm
without and the blare of the radio over
which came a loud and stirring march

  just how far from here is professor
haupts laboratory asked the youthful
stranger of the host as he sipped his
steaming coffee
eighty-five and eighty-seven



  in this kind of weather i would say
about a five-hour climb answered the
host

  could i get a guide to-morrow asked
the youth filling his cup the second time

  not if this weather keeps up there
isnt a man in the village would attempt
it it will be bad enough with this snow
after the storm breaks up and believe
me young man its a weary bird youll
be before you reach that eagles nest of
his laughed the corpulent innkeeper

  i have it explained mine host sud-
denly as the youth was about to speak
herr bruder the grocer is sending up
his supplies day after to-morrow like as
not the storm will be over by then you
can go with hans staal and eric bower
who have been employed to do this once
a month two dare devils and as sure as
two mountain goats you couldnt wish
for better guides and the inkeeper
slapped his fat thighs as his face beamed
with satisfaction

  five days later we find karl marien-
feldt for that was the strangers name
well-established in professor haupts iso-
lated but comfortable home he ac-
quainted himself with the laboratory pre-
paratory to his duties as the assistant of
the old professor

  professor haupt had wired to vienna
for karl upon learning of his fathers
death and for two other reasons one be-
ing that professor marienfeldts fortune
had been in an unknown manner swept
away leaving his son destitute and be-
cause karl during his three years at the
university showed marked inclinations to
follow in his illustrious fathers footsteps
as a renowned chemist

  and now the profressor felt that karl
was well established in his position as
assistant told him his secret

one night a week after karls ar-
rival professor haupt after supper
took him into his study to speak about

his new duties as he had remarked over
the supper table karl could not help but
feel that this statement was only made
because of the servants presence for
there was about the white haired ruddy-
complexioned and intellectual-featured
professor sitting opposite him an air of
deep secrecy something of vast impor-
tance that his merry twinkling eyes
somehow announced

  it was a luxuriously furnished and
comfortable room adjoining the labora-
tory seating themselves in deep up-
holstered chairs a silence ensued that was
broken only by the ticking of a stately
clock standing sentinel beside a long shelf
of books

  after lighting his customary cigar
professor haupt spoke

  karl as my assistant it is necessary
for you to know something that has re-
mained a secret with me for many years
when i have finished it will be known
to two and to you and to me only until
i shall deem it the proper time to disclose
it to the world am i understood karl 

  as karl answered in the affirmative
and sat forward in the eagerness that
gripped him professor haupt bade him
to make himself comfortable for much
had to be said

  you have wondered perhaps as
many others have why i chose this iso-
lated spot for a habitation and a labora-
tory when the immense cities of to-day
offer such comfort and luxury but to
be explicit i must go back ten years i
have always been fond of hiking in fact
i preferred it far above the grinding rou-
tine of the great public gymnasiums
for to me it not only offered me exercise
but it afforded me the opportunity of see-
ing and enjoying the beauty and solitude
of nature

  during my customary vacation in the
mountains one summer i wandered into
this section and its surroundings so ap-
pealed to me that i immediately made a


amazing stories

fortnights reservations at the inn of the
village below

  upon the natives informing me that
an exceptionally fine view could be had
of the country about us from the summit
of this crag i decided one morning to
climb it

  it was quite a strenuous climb for a
man of my years and tired me exceed-
ingly so i seated myself to rest i forgot
my weariness as i literally drank in the
beautiful panorama that presented itself
the village like toylandr below me the
snow-covered peaks towering into the
blue above me and the height and dis-
tance lending an indescribable charm of
perspectiveness karl mans handiwork
no matter how astounding cannot com-
pare with natures and the old pro-
fessor closed his eyes in contemplation
and smoked in silence for several minutes

  arousing himself as if with an effort
he continued having enjoyed this for
several hours i was about to arise and
begin my descent when my eyes en-
countered the formation of the ground
about me i was astounded i could not
believe my sight the ore for of such it
was composed was of such a color and
composition as i had never seen before
taking a sizable portion with me i re-
turned to my laboratory in vienna as
quickly as possible keeping it a secret

  i analyzed it and to my utmost joy
the tests proved it to be an unknown ore
containing some foreign substance never
met with before continuing my tests i
became convinced that this peculiar ore
contained element no  the element
following polonium

  upon making this discovery i de-
cided to give up my presidency and here
build a laboratory thus better enabling
me to keep it a secret in vienna i had
been experimenting in a field of investi-
gation continued failure of which experi-
menting made me despair until i
chanced upon this rare ore which i

thought at last offered some hope of suc-
cess

  after years of the most exhaustive
analytical work success at last rewarded
me karl that ore contained element no
 and ive extracted all of it

  when professor haupt concluded the
last word of that statement karl leaped
to his feet and his face and sparkling
eyes portrayed the emotion that surged
within him

  - he whispered hoarsely bend-
ing over the seated professor can i see
it

  most assuredly you can see it karl
come said professor haupt and arose
leading the way into the laboratory

  winding their way between huge and
intricate apparatuses of professor
haupts own design they stopped before
a glass-topped table upon it rested a
cabinet of exceedingly thick glass and
within it were two small glass bottles
plainly labeled no  and no -
possible

  karl could not restrain his excitement
as the professor calmly opened the cab-
inet door and took out the bottle num-
bered  handing it to his assistant that
young man gazed at it as if entranced

  he saw a bluish slightly glowing crys-
talline substance similar in appearance to
iodine except in color as he gazed at it
professor haupt spoke so rare is it
that from about three tons of ore i have
been able to extract the small amount be-
fore you one ounce and a half and the
final residue i am convinced contains no
 some day we will extract that too
from this black powder

  but the ore professor is it unlim-
ited  asked karl

  no that is all the world can have of
 and 

  but-but- stammered karl per-
plexedly

  my theory began professor haupt
as he replaced the bottles is that a mete-
eighty-five and eighty-seven



orite from some planet rich in this ore
was hurled through space at some remote
time and landed upon this crags top i
have used every grain of ore and i am
positive there is no more in existence
according to this theory

  it can hardly be of use to the world
said karl

  no only in the matter of chemical
theory i have chosen you to assist me in
the experiment which i nearly despaired
of years ago in vienna and professor
haupt extended his hand

  many days were to pass since that
eventful night days of toil and trial that
stretched into a year

  now karl possessed peculiarities which
often put professor haupt in a mental
turmoil of thought but endeavor as he
would he could find neither source nor
reason for them these peculiarities
centered around what modernly would
be called hunches

  in the year that passed there were
many instances during some experiments
that had taxed and thwarted every men-
tal effort of the professor that karl
would without apparent reason word
permission or suggestion use bizarre
methods compounds etc and to the
amazement of the professor they always
terminated in success asking for the
reason or the basic law he would re-
ceive nothing more from karl than a
shrug of his powerful young shoulders
followed with a nonchalant just a
hunch professor

  silently with close study he tried to
solve this baffling sense or hunch of his
assistant but without success although
karls education and knowledge of chem-
istry and science was above the average
for a young man of his age these facts
alone were not enough to account for
such amazing things so the old profes-
sor as the days passed by finally gave up
trying to find the keynote and contented
himself with the thought that he had an

 invaluable assistant in this he was cor-
 rect as passing time later corroborated

   and now we read of the return of
 professor haupt to the great world of
 science to disclose his discovery

 on a brisk autumn day in late no-
 vember the usual staid calm of the
 members of the clique of science was
 upset by the announcement of its secre-
 tary that a telegram of vast import had
 been received further shock was added
 to the confusion when it was found to
 be from none other than professor
 haupt he who had been practically dead
 for ten years in his inaccessible home in
 the tyrol

   professor haupt arrived amidst a wel-
 come he did not expect-received by
 every notable scientist of that day the
 chairman personally conducted the old
 professor and his seemingly nervous
 servant to the same room he had occu-
 pied at the time of his presidency

   after the welcoming banquet in his

	honor all retired to the luxuriant lounge
 where the professor renewed old acquain-
 tances here plans were formulated for
 a meeting which would take place a
 month after the date of his arrival to
 give ample time to those members who
 resided or were upon duties in other
 capitals of the world the purpose of
 the meeting was to disclose the results
 of an amazingly successful discovery

   that night professor haupt retired
 with no little elation as his thoughts re-
 verted to his reception by those whom he
 thought had forgotten him yet amidst
 all this there still lingered in his heart
 an inexplicable loneliness and longing for
 the youth that was not there to enjoy
 these plaudits for their success

   the days passed and the hour at last
 arrived-the audience hall of the clique
 of science was fast filling with its dis-
 tinguished members gathered here and
 there in various groups whispering and


amazing stories

gesticulating the most illustrial scientists
of that year were animatedly conjectur-
ing with word and argument as to the
nature of this latest discovery

  it was with some difficulty that the
chairman finally succeeded in his re-
quests for order and silence following
this were brief and customary formali-
ties regarding the introduction of profes-
sor haupt

  as that venerable old man ascended
the platform from which he was to ad-
dress them a hush fell upon that great
hall-a silence such as can only be in a
place where intelligence reigns and pro-
foundly listens to the enchanting electri-
iying voice of genius	

  gentlemen began professor haupt
you have done me great honor this eve-
ning by your presence here i only hope
that in having set the date of this meeting
a month in advance it has given a
sufficient time for all of you to pre-
pare for this occasion

  i must ask for your patience because
i am forced to go into detail and narrate
certain events interweaving these as i go
along so that stitch by stitch strand by
strand and color by color i shall en-
deavor ere i conclude to set before you
not a fantastic picture but something
clear distinct and beautiful as a pains-
takingly-woven tapestry

  when i left your midst it was not to
isolate myself fostering the thought to
shun society from prejudice or hatred of
humanity nay it was with a set purpose
to accomplish this i needed absolute soli-
tude where my every faculty could con-
centrate without the slightest molestation

  you are all informed regarding the
so-called noble gases of which there are
six namely helium neon argom kryp-
ton xenon and radon four as you
know are found in small quantities in the
atmosphere by manipulation of large
quantities of liquid air these four may be
obtained in quantity and stored in a com-

pressed state in steel cylinders you are
also aware that helium which is exceed-
ingly abundant in our sun is extracted
from oil wells being the first product
after the sinking of a new shaft and
radon is obtained from the decomposition
of radium this of course is the rarest
of all it is an established fact that there
are no known compounds of the six inert
gases if any of you have experimented
in this field you are well aware that flour-
ine the most active element known cap-
able of dissolving even silica and glass
has no effect upon them nor is there a
known element that will combine with
these gases however there are as yet
two unisolated elements nos  and 
in the atomic table and respectively
known as eka-iodine and eka-caesium
the former would be non-metallic a
solid reasonably active chemically and
related to chlorine bromine and iodine
the latter would be a soft and very ac-
tive metal decomposing water rapidly
and related to sodium and potassium of
the alkali-metal group in fact no 
when discovered will be the most active
metal known therefore is it not reason-
able to surmise that either  or  or
both will chemically combine with the in-
ert gases to form hitherto unprecedented
compounds with exceedingly singular
properties gentlemen-and all heads
became erect as professor haupts voice
rang vibrant with emotion i have ex-
tracted element no  eka-iodine from
its ore hitherto unknown and with a
possibility of extracting  from it in the
future

  following this astounding statement
that great hall of great men reverberated
with tumultous applause and pandemon-
ium followed perplexity amazement
and excitement were writ upon every
face as they animately discussed this re-
markable discovery the chemists dream
come true-the completion of the table
of elements such thought arose in many
eighty-five and eighty-seven



  when at last silence was restored pro-
fessor haupt the only calm one of that

vast assemblage resumed gentleman i
must again ask for your patience with
the assistance of a certain young man a
further great achievement resulted he
is i am sure known to some of you karl
marienfeldt son of the late professor
marienfelt a distinguished member of
this clique he came to me after the
death of his father and since then i shall
never regret my using alone his meritor-
ious assistance and companionship i
must here inform you that  had been
discovered a few years ago but i did not
wish to disclose it to the world until i had
further facts about it my one ambition
after its discovery was to combine it
chemically with one or all of the noble
gases i was led into this track of ex-
perimentation by the discovery that it
was a reversion to reactivity in the halo-
gen family being more active than flour-
ine in many respects in this i was prac-
tically at a standstill until karls young
and active brain made new suggestions
however i cannot define for i do not
know where his suggestions began and
mine ended as we worked in perfect uni-
son sometimes for hours without speak-
ing a word

  we used a large evacuated tube at
one millionth of a millimeter pressure
and ran small quantities of the six rare
gases through it energizing them by
means of the ten million volts at our
command this incidentally rearranged
the internal composition of the molecules
of the gases among other things making
them diatomic giving them the same
molecular construction as the active gas
oxygen then passing these reconstruct-
ed rare gases all six in the hope that one
would be successful over a porcelain
boat encased in a silica combustion tube
heated to red heat and containing ele-
ment  we waited with bated breath
for results i can still picture karl his

face aglow not only from the light that
radiated from the combustion tube but
flushed from the excitement within him
that made him breathe with gasps as if in
physical exertion i do not know how i
appeared but it must have been the same
for a tension of conflicting thoughts
gripped my mind and body racing mad-
ly through my brain was the fear of de-
struction as well as the hope of success
our eyes smarting from the peculiar rays
from the glowing element we watched
and waited expecting we knew not what
when a sudden subtle change in color of
the heated substance in the boat caused
us to bend forward in anticipation of a
reaction such a blinding radiance flashed
in our unshielded eyes that we staggered
backward as if mortally wounded re-
covering i rushed to the switch and
turned off the power with blinking eyes
we waited for the mass to cool silently
wondering as we looked at each other
what new inconceivable compound lay
before us

  it was a compound resembling glass
in physical appearance hard but not
brittle and perfectly transparent glowing
with a bluish light at all times in exam-
ining it after the experiment we dis-
covered that it possessed such inexplain-
able refracting power as to astonish us
deciding therefore to use it for telesco-
pic purposes we repeated the experiment
making a specimen two feet in diameter
in examining the gases which issued
from the end of the combustion tube we
were astounded to find all the gases there
except radon if you will notice in the
atomic table radon occupies a position be-
tween  and  being no  at pres-
ent i am not in the position to explain
the significance of this statement but no
doubt it has some bearing on the prob-
lem

  with unceasing labor we produced a
perfect lens as far as shape goes and fit-
ted it into a telescope of our own design


amazing stories

completing this early one afternoon we
hardly found the patience to wait for the
darkness to fall

  so the moment came that meant so
much to us for i was certain it would
prove to have phenomenal magnification
but gazing through it we were doomed
to such disappointment as can rock the
foundation of the senses

  then followed days of ceaseless toil
trials and failures until we worked upon
the theory that a reflecting surface would
be necessary to render an image for
this purpose we employed highly-polished
sheets of every metal procurable and
also glass the latter we found was pe-
culiarly etched after use all of these we
tried until we were on the verge of de-
spair one day karl without the slight-
est reason suggested the use of mer-
cury which he had tried before in mo-
tion circularly placing this in position
at the lower end of the telescope we con-
nected it to an electric motor which re-
volved in such a way that its surface was
extremely smooth i then trained the
telescope upon the various portions of the
heavens

  previous disappointments had cal-
loused us to its sharp pangs and we ac-
cepted this latest failure undisturbed
the mirrored surface remained unbrok-
en  karl then attempting it turned away
at last as i had done and suddenly aris-
ing with expressed disgust aacidently
struck the telescope with his shoulder
thus turning it in a quarter circle he
was about to leave when a bluish light
flooded the disc of revolving mercury

   look look professor  he called to
me across the laboratory reaching his
side as hurriedly as possible i noticed his
face portraying great astonishment and
followed his staring eyes-

  gentlemen i upon that revolving disc
of mercury was reflected in proportion
to its relative size what would be a scene
of about two thousand square feet of

some planet so plain that it seemed i was
merely looking out of one of my window-
panes 

  following the direction in which the
telescope was pointed we found it to be
trained upon the brightest object in the
earthly sky the planet venus therefore
the newly-discovered element no  shall
be named venusine as karl and i
agreed between us the ore from which
i extracted element  must have been
the remains of a metorite from venus
and in some inexplicable way this ele-
ment is related to bound up in venus
and in venus only

  thus ended the epochal-making speech
of professor johann haupt

   it is an interesting suggestion that the
list of elements should be filled up by
elements from another planet

snow cold and yuletide spirit her-
alded in the month of december

  up the almost snow-obliterated path
that twisted to the crags summit were
toiling a party of men in single file the
majority of these consisted of the com-
mittee chosen by the clique of science
to accompany professor haupt those
remaining were personal servants of the
scientists and some few packing the sup-
plies several feet ahead of them the old
professor was leading the way his merry
twinkling eyes expressing the happy
thoughts within him

  sighs of relief floated up in the cold
december air amidst clouds of exhala-
tions when the summit was reached

  the professor was some hundred feet
ahead of the rest who were following
him in the knee-deep snow when he
reached the door of his home upon
ringing and waiting several times and re-
ceiving no answer he turned to those
coming up saying evidently karl sleeps
late when his master is away those ad-
dressed smiled for it was close to noon
so drawing his own latch-key he un-
locked and opened the door
eighty-five and eighty-seven



  the room they entered had more the
appearance of a lounge than a reception
room for it was exceptionally large it
contained comfortable lounges and deep-
upholstered chairs to accommodate more
than the party who entered they all
seated themselves and cheerful conversa-
tion buzzed as they felt the glowing
warmth of the huge electric coils

  upon professor haupt asking and re-
ceiving permission he detailed some of
the servants to a most-modernly equipped
kitchen requesting them to prepare hot
tea and coffee the remaining attendants
unpacked bundles and took care of wraps
and over-shoes this completed to his
satisfaction the professor excused him-
self from his illustrious company saying
with a mischievous smile he was going
to awaken his negligent assistant and left
them through a door that evidently led
to the sleeping quarters

   ten minutes had elapsed when all at-
tention was drawn to the sliding doors
that led from the laboratory for these
were violently thrust aside and from
their gaping space a stinging sweep of
cold air fell upon those assembled in the
reception room professor haupt stag-
gered into the room his face portraying
to them some ghastly misfortune sev-
eral rushed to his side perceiving his
faintness and gently led him to a lounge

  some managed to stammer after the
professor had been seated what has
happened sir

   staring at the floor before him he spoke
slowly amidst the breathless silence that
ensued a most singular-i am afraid
a most dreadful-thing has happened
during my absence his snow-white
head sank upon his clenched hands one
of which clutched a sheet of paper as
if trying to shut out some appalling scene
before his gaze

   he rose after several moments of si-
lence once more the calm masterful
scientist standing erect with his arms

behind his back he addressed them with
a completely controlled voice gentle-
men i think you can get a more distinct
idea from what i shall read to you of
what has happened than from any guess
or condemnation that i might make on
this matter and as he finished he un-
folded the paper that was clutched in his
hand

  the company were deadly silent in an-
ticipation of what they were to learn

  some of the servants at this moment
entered with trays of steaming tea and
coffee but it was to grow cold in their
hands as they listened spellbound to what
professor haupt was beginning to read

pvear professor haupt two days

  -i- went by after your departure
when i found myself overwhelmingly
oppressed by loneliness despite the fact
that i was comfortably seated in the
study and listening to a musical pro-
gram from some far-away station it
seems as if it was born out of the celes-
tial strains of that captivating music-
that peculiar idea that came seeping into
my consciousness as if from a mightier
intelligence it drove me on-urged me
on-beyond the power of my own will
to combat it

  i rose mechanically and entered the
laboratory there i worked feverishly
night and day for weeks with but a few
intervals for rest and sustenance i was
drawn irresistibly to the cabinet where re-
posed the bottles holding element  and
the black powder containing element 

  then upon my mind was borne like
a flash the urge to experiment with the
two in conjunction while looking for
a porcelain boat which you kept in the
glassware cabinet in the southwest cor-
ner of the laboratory i noticed for the
first time the door hidden and almost im-
perceptible behind the static machine
which door i had never had occasion to
use finding no porcelain boat among


amazing stories

the paraphernalia in the cabinet i
thought perhaps this door led to another
storeroom and not wanting to recross
the laboratory opened it never did i
expect to see that which presented itself
to my eyes whatever plans you had in
mind for space exploration in this well-
built one-man rocket i shall change them
it occurs to me now that your intention
in hiring me may have been to have me
pilot your rocket into unexplored space
as it chances so it will be

  duplicating our experiment whereby
we combined radon with venusine to get
the super-lens of our telescope i made a
slight change i added a pinch of the
black powder which you had labeled 
possible tfye reaction which followed
was identical with the original one and
i took the precaution to wear smoked
glasses the reagents were identical ex-
cept for the small quantity of  pos-
sible and the reaction was identical but
the product was different suggesting to
my mind a catalytic reaction examining
the residual gases i found radon and
helium had combined with  helium
had been caused to enter the reaction by
the catalytic action of element 

  after the combustion tube cooled i
saw a glowing bluish substance resting
lightly against the top of the tube the
significance of it burst upon me i had
here a substance which defied gravity
taking the substance from the tube i
noticed its upward pull about equalled
the pull of a toy-balloon filled with hy-
drogen this dampened my spirits some-
what for this pull would hardly free an
object from the earths attraction i felt

i	was near to answering that most puz-
zling of all scientific questions what is
gravity the rest of that day i sat in
a brown study day-dreaming and at-
tempting to fathom the reason for this
strange compounds property of resisting
gravity its being a solid mass

  electricity and gravity are related as

is shown at various times in scientific re-
search especially in that dealing with in-
ter-atomic structure electricity is de-
fined as the flow of free electrons of the
outer shells of atoms following a suitable
conductor gravity in turn must affect
mainly the protons for an atoms weight
rests in the nucleus you know all this
professor but what i am trying to show
is a connection between electricity and
gravity as i reasoned the new com-
pound must have acquired its curious
property of gaseous lightness from a re-
action in the nuclei of the atoms now
as you know all nuclei made up of pro-
tons as far as weight is concerned except
those of hydrogen gas only have elec-
trons in them to balance the outer shells
negative charges hence the reaction may
have been electrical in nature somehow
transforming the protons through the
agency of the accompanying electrons
and giving them a new property of losing
weight or defying gravity pull the pull
of neighboring atoms continuing on this
line i gradually came to the conviction
that an electric current ought to further
the work started by the catalytic action of
eka-caesium no  contained in minute
quantities in the black powder

  accordingly next morning i clamped
the hard but non-brittle semi-transparent
solid down and successively subjected it
to larger and larger electric shocks start-
ing with  volts nothing hap-
pened even after  volts were
loosed the crackling lace-like sparks
merely played over the surface of the
substance plugging in the multiple trans-
former at  volts i placed the two
wires sealed in large glass insulators at
opposite ends of the object as my finger
poised above the key of the circuit i won-
dered why i kept up this discouraging
experiment and found i had no satis-
factory answer except that some invis-
ible power or urge impelled me onward

i	was aware only of a loud noise as i
eighty-five and eighty-seven



depressed the key and then all was black

i	must have been unconscious only a few
minutes and revived to find a cold draft
chilling me my eyes stared straight into
the blue vault of the heavens through a
good-sized hole in the roof marking the
passage of the vise and the compound

  professor haupt this new compound
energized by  volts becomes a
substance entirely freed from the earths
gravitation and would be able to lift
enormous loads due to the speed with
which it would be thrown from the earth
by centrifugal force amounting to about
 feet per second in this latitude
when you see the hole in the roof and
the part of the bench to which the vise
was attached that was taken along by
the compound you will realize the enor-
mous force of such a gravity-freed sub-
stance

   rather than being disappointed by the
loss of the compound i was heartened
that my theory was correct in which i
had assumed electricity would further the
catalytic action of  in the combination
of venusine with radon and helium in
fact professor i have come to the con-
clusion that these combinations that you
and i have made with venusine and the
rare gases are not chemical in nature at
all but purely electrical for instance in
chemical synthesis of inorganic binary
compounds with the elemental constitu-
ents the volume of the product seldom
increases out of the proportion it should
whereas in making our super-lens we
used  grams of venusine and several
liters of radon to get a solid plate two
feet in diameter the only comparison
to this is the burning of mercurous thio-
cyanate whereby a voluminous ash is ob-
tained which is however porous and
easily crumbled then too chemical
combination in the rare gases is impos-
sible for they have no valence

  i set about immediately to make a
sufficient quantity of the new compound

am sorry this used all of  and 
which you and the world had

to propel your rocket through space i
am sorry this necessitated my using all of
 and  which you and the world
had of them

  a lump of about a liter in volume re-
warded my efforts i carefully rigged up
a circuit leading the current of our 
million volt lightning generator to op-
posite sides of the outer shell of the
rocket the lump of the floating sub-
stance i suspended at the nose of the
rocket inside and electrically connected
to the outer shell of the rocket it will
receive more than the necessary 
volts when the circuit is closed a time-
clock out in the laboratory will close the
circuit when i am all ready to leave

  i dont know why i have done all
this some unknown unseen power has
led me on and i find myself prepared to
leave this earth

  professor as you know the construc-
tion of your rocket i shall have no fear
of lack of oxygen or warmth your in-
genuity has also set aside any fears i
may have entertained of combating the
conditions of inter-stellar space and it
seems to me at present professor that
you did lack but two things in this mar-
vellous rockets of yours a pilot and
means of propulsion it seems i am the
first and have solved the second

  all is in preparedness i am properly
dressed and when i lay down my pen i
shall leave this world forever there
can be but one destination for as you
know venusine has some forceful con-
nection with the planet venus and even
as the metorite in past ages landed upon
the earth so will my rocket return with
the gift of venue farewell my dear
professor and friend i am leaving-

amazing stories

  night descended and the snow-capped
peaks of the tyrols stood sentinel through
the wintery silence clearness and cold-
ness seemed to intensify the silver lustre
of the stars above a rare night-

  the hour had arrived for that distin-
guished committee of scientists to make
complete by witnessing the wonders of
the venusine telescope the triumphant
hour of professor haupt dressed
warmly against the cold draft of air that
descended from the torn roof above into
the laboratory the scientists gathered
about the professor as he went through
the preparations necessary to put the tel-
escope into working order

  exclamations of amazement fell from
the lips of these famous men as they
viewed scene after scene of the planet
venus  million miles away at various
times the mist which covers the surface
of the planet was broken to reveal scenes
of trackless jungles cities that towered
high into its atmosphere great cylinder-

the

 like air ships that traversed these spaces
 at terrific speeds although the scenes
 were in reliefs of various shades of blue
 withal they were very distinct as to
 its inhabitants nothing can be said they
 being too small to be seen individually

   professor johann haupt was hailed as
 the greatest scientist of his day yet that
 venerable old man was not as happy as
 most would think even though the world
 was at his feet in admiration

   hourly he toiled for out in that vast
 infinite space upon the planet venus
 somewhere was karl marienfeldt some-
 how sometime-in the years to come-he
 felt that through his efforts to would see
 or hear of karl to that end with undy-
 ing hope he labored

   who knows what the end would have
 been had not the elements  and 
 been so rare that all the world had of
 these was contained in that one disc of
 venusine in professor haupts mirac-
 ulous telescope

part ii

in this second part of the story the reader should observe the way in which
the characters of the members of the party are pictured the author shows
great skill here with a southern negro and a western cowboy and a typical
english sporting man as objects of his description the reader must not
miss either the little malay who is a marvel in his way

what has gone before

   a very interesting party of travelers one
bent on exploration another one a great hunter
and a western cowboy with their attendants
start into the wild region of the unexplored
area of the andes in the party there is at
attendant a negro and a malay the latter in
the service of the great hunter they progress
quietly until reaching some defiles where they
are attacked by concealed brigands their pack
animals are dispersed with their drivers there
is some loss of life among them but they give
a very good account of themselves killing some
of the brigands what is left of the party the
five who have been mentioned above manage
to go ahead on their way and have a strange
beginning of adventure 

   there is an inscription on the rock which
none of the party can read but which is fa-
miliar to the chief of the expedition an accom-
plished archaeologist a further attack upon
them is frustrated by the strange little malay
who climbs up the face of the rock and drives
his serpentine dagger or kris into the brigand
who has been attacking them from the height
of an almost inaccessible natural bridge

chapter iv
the valley of chameleon men

the spot where we stood was
a mere shelf of rock perhaps
ten feet square formed by a
shallow cave or hollow in the
cliff and evidently partly
natural and partly artificial tool
marks were plainly visible upon the sur-
face of the stone and holes for fastening
the cables of the ancient bridge had
been cut through two projecting ribs on
buttresses of rock on the opposite side

of the canon we could see similar holes
and fragments of rotted cables beside
the opening of the narrow defile lead-
ing into the mountains and from the
rocky platform we had reached at so
much risk a narrow trail wound around
the face of the precipice i say trail
but it was not worthy of the name for
it was merely a crack or crevice a fault
in the strata that had been roughly
smoothed and in places widened by
human hands no doubt an indian or a
llama would have found it an easy and
safe pathway but to a white man it ap-
peared woefully narrow and perilous in
the extreme and sam shuddered and al-
most wept at the thought of treading it
but at last after much urging a deal
of swearing some sharp commands and
a threat to leave him behind if he didnt
brace up we got him started

  it was a nerve racking a terrifying
experience to walk along that ten-inch
footway with the sheer precipice above
the perpendicular cliff below in many
places the rock overhung and we were
compelled to stoop low in other places
bits of rock had fallen from above and
with bated breaths and tingling toes we
picked our way over the debris fearful
that a misstep or a loose stone might
hurl us into space and in more than one
spot the edge of the shelf had crumbled

the creature for it could scarcely be called a man was barely three feet
in height the head out of all proportion to the body and limbs was
elongated sloping upward from the monkey-like face to a high-peaked crown
covered with a mop of brownish-black hair
through the andes



away leaving such a narrow ledge that
we were forced to place our backs against
the wall and with outstretched arms
edge inch-by-inch along the cliff with
toes projecting over the abyss karen
alone appeared oblivious of the danger
of that nerve-trying trail as easily and
nonchalantly as though it had been a
broad highway he trotted along carry-
ing the guns as sure-footed and immune
to dizziness as a mountain goat or a
structural steel worker

  oh i say cried saunderson after
we had been following the awful path-
way for half a mile or more what
happens if we meet other chappies com-
ing along deucedly inconvenient dont
you think no traffic signals and all
that sort of thing

  reckon you push em off if they dont
push you off first said red this is
a one-way street mister

  not much chance of meeting any-
body i told them no human being
has been this way for hundreds of years
in my opinion

  cant precisely be called the broad
highway observed saunderson as we
came to a particularly bad spot

  but all things have an end and at
last we came suddenly and quite unex-
pectedly to a gap in the cliff with a
flight of rougly-hewn stone steps leading
upward

ust be the famous golden
stairs j exclaimed saunderson
gazing upward seem to lead to the
sky positively

  wha la tank tha good lord we tru
wif that exclaimed sam chief ah
don never set me foots on such road
again an no mistakin bout it no sir
chief ah remains right here an die fore
ah does so chief

  like hell you would scoffed red
soons ever we went off an left you
youd come lopin along after us like

a houn pup i aint sayin as id choose
that trail for a evenin stroll but taint
nothin to starvin to death or bein left
alone up in this country what god for-
got

  as the others had been speaking i had
been moving about examining the evi-
dences of mans ancient handiwork here
and there were traces of carvings or
sculptures so badly eroded by the ele-
ments through countless centuries as to
be scarcely distinguishable and in one
spot was a little niche with sculptured
human figures on either side apparently
the place had been used as a sort of
shrine by travellers along the route as
i raised myself on a fragment of rock
the better to peer into the opening some-
thing was dislodged and fell with a
tinkling sound to the stones an ejacula-
tion of mingled surprise and delight
came from my lips as i picked it up it
was a metal disk about two inches in
diameter and with a perforation near
one edge obviously for the purpose of
suspending it by a string about the
owners neck and by the dull brownish-
yellow color of the pendant and its
weight i knew instantly that it was
gold but i scarcely noticed this at the
time for my interest was focused on the
embossed design upon the surface of
the disk a design showing a figure of
the sun with a humanized jaguar head
in the centre and around the edges the
same symbols that we had seen cut into
the rock above the natural bridge and
on the cliff where we had clambered up
to the ancient trail

  oh i say what have you found
queried saunderson strolling over to
where i stood examining my discovery
ton my word its an amulet he
exclaimed as he peered over my shoulder
some chappie must have dropped it
here rather a jolly bit of junk really

  more than that-priceless i said
handing it to him do you see those


amazing stories

characters they would tell the whole
story if-

  by jove its gold he ejaculated
oh i say lets search about a bit may
be treasure-trove here dont you think

  no i do not i told him this was
lost fell from some persons neck when
the cord wore through its a wonderful
specimen-unlike anything ive ever
seen and as far as i am aware the only
incan or pre-incan object bearing an
unquestionable inscription

t ooks like money to me de-
 clared red who had joined us
mebbe them old injuns what used this
trail had a store or a lunch counter here
and used these things for buyin grub
me i wish to blazes there was a hot
dog stand right here this minute id
give moren thats worth for a couple
of franks an a dash of mustard or a
hot tamale right now

  as we reached the topmost stair we
found ourselves upon the summit of a
high ridge behind us vast peaks soared
upward to gleaming white summits
three miles or more in air to right and
left the serried ramparts of the andes
hemmed us in in the distance stretched
a range of lower mountains while be-
yond these were still more peaks like a
solid wall against the sky but in the
foreground extending from the base of
the ridge whereon we stood was a
green and verdant valley a valley of
grassy meadows and patches of wood-
land with the silvery glint of water be-
tween the trees and marvelously beauti-
ful to our eyes after so many days of
bare forbidding mountain sides and dis-
mal canons

  the achcacuna i exclaimed
weve found it got into it by acci-
dent 

  i dont reckon them bandits was a
accident said red an they was what
herded we-all into here damned if

taint purty jhough an looks as if
thered be game there aint much danger
of us starvin as long as we stay here
but how the blazes are we goin to pull
up stakes an get out when we decide to
vamoose 

  my dear man exclaimed saunder-
son why weary your brain and shatter
the joy of the present by pessimistic
forebodings of the future sufficient
unto the day and all that sort of thing
you know ton my word yes and
necessity is the mother of invention and
where theres a will theres a way et
cetera et cetera let your jolly old nut
have a vacation my lad here we are
and with a perfectly ripping little park
to run about in and hunt the red deer
in the merry greenwood by jove yes
and we may even find nymphs or lovely
woodland sprites and you can play
satyr-i say doctor red would make a
perfectly ripping saytr dont you think 
red couldnt suppress a grin at saun-
dersons irrepressible nonsense more
chances of findin a bunch of lousy hos-
tyle injuns he muttered an me i
aint pinin to play with no squaws
hostyle or totherwise

  saunderson chortled with glee and
slapped the texan on the back youve
missed your vocation red my lad he
declared should be on the stage of a
music hall absolutely yes youre better
than will rogers really but if there
be nympths or dryads in yonder wood-
land dells far be it from me to disap-
point them should they desire a frolic
by the rood yes putting aside the
weapons of the chase i will take up the
pipes of pan think you not that i will
prove a satyr worthy of the name 
placing an imaginary pipe to his lips
he began dancing and prancing about
until sam collapsed with merriment and
even karens parchment-like features
wrinkled in a grin

  well dont go a layin down them
through the andes



guns an doin no rumba with the girls
afore you shoot enough meat for grub
said red long as i can eat youre
right welcome to play the goat with
injun squaws or nymphs or any other
skirts but youd better watch your
step mister most injuns what ive
run acrost aint partial to white men
monkeyin around their women
come on boys i exclaimed lets
get down there before its any later i
dont see any signs of inhabitants-no
villages no houses no cultivated land
no smoke but there must be game and
i feel as if i could eat steadily for a
week	j

  righto agreed saunderson but
we cant clambor down here you know
its a sheer drop of a hundred feet at
least to that debris-slope below and-
he added as he peered over the verge of
the cliff-the bally old hill appears to
be the same as far as one can see in
either direction i say do we jump or
fly down to the valley

  saunderson was right the hill upon
which we had debouched after ascend-
ing the stone steps from the canon rose
in a sheer wall above the valley

  wish to blazes i had my rope
muttered red  pears like to me we
come to the end of our trail cant go
back an cant go forard afore ill
starve to death sittin up here ill jump
off an have done with it

  my dear man exclaimed saunder-
son why attempt to commit quite
justifiable suicide in this spot you might
not be killed you know go back in the
canon by all means and make a certain
and clean job of it absolutely as we
had been speaking we had been wan-
dering aimlessly along the rocky hilltop
and karen-who always reminded me
of a faithful and inquisitive spaniel by
his actions-had hurried on ahead run-
ning this way and that pausing now and
then to peer over the precipice as if

calculating the possibilities of climbing

down

  suddenly he halted stooped down and
the next instant vanished

ood lord whats happened to
vj karen i cried breaking into a
run he must have fallen into a hole
or crack

  confound the beggar exclaimed
saunderson he had my guns cant
afford to lose those you know

  but before we had taken a dozen
strides the malay reappeared waving his
arm and shouting

  by jove that is a bit of luck cried
saunderson says hes discovered a
rope

  ridiculous i declared how could
there be a rope here he must have
found an old root or vine or something
i-

  but my words were lost to saunder-
son for he had sprinted at karens an-
nouncement and reaching his servants
side had vanished together with the
malay a moment later we came to the
spot and the mysterious disappearances
were explained cut into the rock was
a sort of well with a flight of steps
leading downward and from somewhere
below we could hear saundersons voice
followed by red and sam i leaped
down the steps in the opposite side of
the well was an arched passage ending
at the face of the cliff and bending
over some object on the floor of the
tunnel were the two men

  oh i say cried saunderson when
he looked up at my approach karen has
made a discovery

  i hurried forward saunderson was
busy unrolling what at first glance ap-
peared like a bundle of old chains

  found it tucked away in that little
niche he explained called it a rope
the beggar but the jolly old things a
ladder here sam give me a hand old


amazing stories

chap and well be popping down into
the valley in no time

  there was no question that saunder-
son was right it was a ladder formed
of chains and metal rungs and red and
myself as well as sam lent a hand to
untangle it

  damned funny it aint rusted none
observed red as he worked

  cant rust you know said saunder-
son its made of bronze

 drawing my knife i scraped away
some of the black sulphide that covered
the metal not bronze i told him-
silver

  red straightened up with a jerk is
that straight doc he demanded holy
catfish if this things silver its worth
a heap of good money must weigh near
half a ton

  very nearly i replied and worth
about five or six thousand dollars as
bullion but not worth a cent here
youd have to carry it out and youd
need a motor truck or a string of llamas
to do that even if there were a good
road i-

  my dear man exclaimed saunder-
son its worth a million to us here
its absolutely priceless it has saved our
lives actually righto its all clear now
to drop it over the edge and down well

go-

  how you goin to hitch this end to
hold it asked red aint nothin here
to tie to

  i was examining the contrivance and
i glanced up i think we can solve that
problem i told him see these hooks
on the end of the chains i think well
find eyes or holes to receive them if we
look about

fjere they is chief announced
al sam who had been peering out
over the valley

 just within the opening were two
metal bars set firmly in the rock and

hooking the end of the ancient ladder
over these we lowered it down the face
of the cliff

  better send karen down first i
suggested when he reaches the bottom
he can hold the lower ends steady well
each have to carry a gun

  five minutes later we stood in the
valley beneath the cliff

  well thats that observed red as
he examined his beloved six-guns now
if we dont run acrost no hostyle injuns
i reckon well be sittin pretty for a
spell

 not much need to worry over in-
dians i declared confidently if there
are any here they would have seen us
coming down and would have appeared
by this time lets get started youd
better go first saunderson so you can
shoot anything edible that appears
and dont you go missin red ad-
monished him my stummicks that
empty i can hear the two sides of it
knockin together every step i take

  we had not gone two hundred yards
when a small deer sprang from its bed
in the low brush and saunderson bagged
it with his first shot

  looks like we was goin to eat
observed red how about makin camp
over beside the creek doc pears to
me we all want a mighty good rest
afore driftin on an a good feed
and a jolly good bath too de-
clared saunderson

  good idea i agreed were in no
hurry and this is as good a spot as
any

  a dip in the clear cool water of the
stream and a satisfying meal of broiled
venison made us feel like new men and
it was pure delight to rest there under
the trees with greenery on every side
with birds chirping and singing in the
thickets and squawking parrots winging
overhead while ever in our ears was the
musical tinkling of the rivr
through the andes



  i aint never felt no more peaceful-
like nowhere remarked red as he
stretched himself on the grass and
yawned contentedly if i only had a
few more plugs of tobacco id feel like
this was pretty plumb near heaven

i-

  perfectly top-hole exclaimed saun-
derson only one fly in my ointment as
one might express it my supply of to-
bacco is beastly low by jove

  i laughed so is mine i said but
doesnt it strike you as a queer bit of
psychology that we are only thinking
of that deficiency now all the time
we were in the canon it never occured
to us however if we find indians they
probably will have tobacco

  reckon we wont need it-after we
meet up with em muttered red

  my word red my lad you are a con-
firmed pessimist saunderson told him
dont you ever look upon the bright
and cheerful side of anything really
i dunno replied the texan i done
so once an damn near got killed cause
of so doin sence then ive been lookin
for trouble if you get the idea every-
things goin to be on the up-an-up and
things break wrong its mighty disap-
pointin but if youre expectin trouble
an things break tother way round why
its a damned pleasant surprise

  your philosophy is past my compre-
hension declared saunderson but-
with an assumed sigh-there may be
something in it yes by jove i believe
there is if i hadnt hoped to meet wood
nymphs in this dell i would have
chortled with joy when they appeared
but because i looked forward to a
frolic with the darling creatures and
none have greeted me i am in the
depths of despair i-

  red half rose and shied a stick at
the other thought you was along for to
hunt game and not to chase skirts he
said

  saunderson grinned my dear man
he exclaimed are you not aware that
nymphs in this dell i would have
distinctly do not wear skirts i-

  his sentence was cut short by the ar-
rival of sam who had been bathing a
few rods down stream and now ap-
peared a dripping black figure wild
eyed and terrified

ha la he cried ah see a
jumbie chief ah see a jumbie
for true

  reckon he seen one of your girl-
friends mister saunderson grinned
red mebbe theyre lookin for you
better go meet em afore sam gets ahead
of you in that satyr stunt if-

  what do you mean-a jumbie i
demanded of sam who or what did
you see or thought you saw

  despite reds bantering words he had
leaped to his feet and with hands rest-
ing on his revolver butts he was moving
cautiously towards the river

  sams teeth were chattering so he
scarcely could speak ah-ah was cornin
out tha water when ah see he he
stammered ah see he standin on tha
san beach peerin at me an ah peer at
he an whilst ah peerin bam he gone
yaas sir chief he clean gone like he
blow up like to soap bubble tha wha
he do chief an tha the truf an he
jumbie he sure jumbie chief fo he
green he all green like parrot an ah
scairt chief ah sure am scairt an
ah not stop to put on me clos but ah
jus run an look me here

  extraordinary exclaimed saunder-
son a green jumbie my word but i
must bag that fellow

  utter nonsense i declared pos-
sioly you saw an indian sam-though
i doubt if you saw any human being-
and he may possibly have been clothed
in green but if he vanished it was


amazing stories

when he ducked into the bushes when
you werent looking

  by jove i dont wonder he vanished
-when he saw sam d-o-nudist said
saunderson as we followed after red
with sam fairly quaking with fear in
the rear

  dont see no signs of hide nor hair
of no jumbie nor nothin red an-
nounced when we reached the spot where
sam had seen his jumbie reckon
sams been seein things if-

  at this instant karen said something
in a low tone to his master

  i say ejaculated saunderson
karen says there has been a man here
found his tracks over wonder in the
sand

  didnt i tell you wed be runnin
acrost hostyle injuns growled red

  and didnt i suggest dryads
grinned saunderson no more evidence
of one than of the other if the beggar
had been hostile he would have attacked
sam probably the chaps frightened out
of his wits at finding us here must have
thought hed seen a devil when he saw
sam naked

  no sir mister saunderson pro-
tested sam he debbil hesef ah dont
fraid buckman but ah fraid jumbies
an ah know jumbie when ah see he
really in that case my boy will
you kindly describe the ear marks by
which you distinguish your jumbie
friends from ordinary indians  saun-
derson asked him

before sam could reply an arrow
sang through the air within an inch
of his head with a terrified yell he
turned and ran and the rest of us fol-
lowed as the arrows from invisible
enemies fell all about us

  damned nice friendly outfit-them
dryads of yourn was reds comment
as out of range of the savages missiles
we crouched in an open space with no

cover near but me i aint aimin to
do no frolickin with em mister
saunderson carefully adjusting the
sights of his rifle winked and grinned
my dear red he said yonder
archers are not my friends but yours
you sought for hostile natives and your
fondest desires have been fulfilled
really my lad you should feel quite
elated at the accuracy of your predic-
tions

  red spat hell lets quit kiddin an
talk sense he growled here we be
with them injuns hidin in the brush an
just achin to lift our scalps the ques-
tion is how we goin to get outen here
with whole skins

  saunderson shook his head red
he said your ignorance of the south
american aborigines is absolutely appal-
ling they do not follow the playful
custom of removing scalps ask the
doctor-he knows it is far more prob-
able that our indian friends are ach-
ing to lift our heads as to how we are
to escape from our present predicament
with epidermis entire that my dear red
is a mooted question well worthy of con-
sideration dont you think

  say cant you never talk english
an common sense demanded red

  saunderson chuckled ah that is the
question he exclaimed if i speak the
kings english it does not appeal to you
as common sense and if i use common
sense i do not speak the kings english
so to save time and get down to brass
tacks as you would express it let us
all talk american now whats your
idea doctor do you- the roar of
his rifle interrupted his words at its
report a chorus of wild terrified cries
came from the woods across the stream

  reckon you must have got one of
em commented red but them
screeches didnt sound like there was
such a all-fired lot of em

  probably not i said and as they
through the andes



have never before heard the sound of a
gunshot they may be so filled with terror
that they will not try to molest us fur-
ther my suggestion is that we keep to
the open out of arrow-shot as much
as possible and try to placate rather
than fight these people whoever they
may be

  you mean make palaver with em
red queried not me i dont how the
hell you goin to talk with em when
first time you get near enough to holler
theyll fire an arrer through you

  by jove why didnt i bring along a
suit of my knightly ancestors armor
cried saunderson  pon my word the
old dons had the right idea absolutely
yes if and when i join another expedi-
tion into the achcacuna i shall
come clad cap-a-pie in mail they car-
ved at the meal with gloves of steel and
drank the red wine through the helmet
barred and all that sort of thing you
know

  thought you was goin to talk united
states barked red this aint-hell
an damnation gorrimighty whats that
hit me

  he had leaped up and was staring
wildly about rubbing his left arm a
strange expression of mingled pain and
puzzlement on his face

  i stopped and picked up the object
which seemingly had fallen from the
skies and had struck red a resounding
blow just above his elbow

qling stone i announced exhibit-
 ing the spherical missile and
made of cassiterite-stream tin-as
heavy as lead if- a scream from sam
interrupted my words wha la he
blubbered ah shot ah shot chief
ah shot in tha back fo true ah-
down i shouted flat on our
stomachs stuff your hats with grass and
pull them low if one of those stones
hits a mans head hes finished

  even sams grinned saunderson
ouch by the lord harry they do
hurt feel as if i were back in the
trenches again and i say where are
the damnable beggars

  stones is cornin from over in that
patch of pamettoes replied red meb-
be if we-

  saunderson did not wait for him to
finish his sentence but as fast as he
could pull trigger fired a volley of steel-
jacketed bullets into the thicket of palm
trees

  yells screams strange animal-like
cries followed but no more sling
stones fell

  what we really require is a machine-
gun observed saunderson as he re-
loaded his rifle or grenades

  why not wish for gas projectors
or an aeroplane with bombs i said
weve got to get out of here while
those devils are in a panic or well
never get out alive

  yeah an where we goin to head
for demanded red back up that
cliff an starve to death atop there
me im for rushin em an wipin out
as many as we can may get a few
arrers into our hides or bones bust by
these damn rocks but some of usll
come through i- an arrow struck
quivering in the ground beside him and
red wheeled and fired with a single
motion

  he wont make no more trouble he
announced grimly theyre pizen-
pizen as rattlers an sam was right
theyre green painted i reckon i just
cotched a glimpse of him movin and let
go if-

  good lord exclaimed saunderson
look look there doctor on that sand
bar do you see anything

  as i turned and peered at the spot he
indicated a gasp of utter amazement
came from my lips no sign of a human
being was visible upon the pebbly sand


amazing stories

bar but clearly outlined against the
lighter background of beach was a bow
and just beyond it was what appeared
to be a dark colored rock

  what the- reds exclamation was
drowned in the explosion of saunder-
sons rifle

  we stared speechless astounded at
the report the bow had flown to one
side a portion of the sand bar had ap-
peared to rise and fall convulsively
and now as we gazed we could see a
slight motion like the twitching of a
lizards tail among the pebbles

  consumed with curiosity filled with
wonder and oblivious of our danger we
hurried to the spot stretched upon the
sand was the strangest creature human
eyes had ever seen

   taint no injun its a overgrowed
horned-toad exclaimed red

  extraordinary cried saunderson
is it human or reptilian ton my
word its a nightmare absolutely

the creature for it could scarcely
be called a man was barely three
feet in height the head out of all pro-
portion to the body and limbs was
elongated sloping upward from the
monkey-like face to a high peaked crown
covered with a mop of brownish-black
hair the limbs hands and feet were
those of a human being and the nude
body was that of a man but the skin
instead of being brown black yellow or
of any other color of the human race
was a mottled grayish and so covered
with warty excrescences and so rough
that it gave the weird being the ap-
pearance of a toad and blended perfectly
with the surface and color of the sand
bar

  hes human all right i declared in
reply to saundersons question a
dwarf or pygmy a horribly repulsive
little beast but hes suffering your
bullet broke his neck hell die in a few

minutes but we cant leave him here to
die too bad-

  reckon itd be sort of a mercy to
put a forty-five through his head said
red his hand moving towards his re-
volver

  it would i agreed but could
you after all hes a man no hell be
dead in a few moments more lets
carry him over to the bank where theres
some shade

  lifting the strange freak who couldnt
have weighed over seventy-five pounds
we carried him to the bank of the stream
and placed him on the grass and then
an amazing an absolutely incredible
thing happened there under our as-
tounded unbelieving eyes the dying
creature was changing color

  slowly at first then more rapidly the
gray mottled skin took on a shade of
green until within perhaps thirty sec-
onds the uncanny being was the color
of the grass and weeds whereon he
gasped out his last breath

  my god ejaculated saunderson in
hushed awed tones oh my sainted
aunt is such a thing possible or am i
going mad

   taint possible but we seen it
muttered red hes a damned chame-
leon thats what he is

  i grasped saundersons arm look
i whispered

  peering at us from the thicket were a
dozen or more of the strange beings
only their malformed heads and ape-
like faces visible

  reds hand moved towards his hol-
ster but i checked him no i com-
manded dont shoot they havent
made a hostile move all the time weve
been here within easy range of their
weapons i dont think they will i be-
lieve the death of this one has saved us
theyre probably filled with abject
terror now they have seen one of their
number killed by our strange weapons
through the andes



come on well move off quietly and see
what happens

  rejoining sam and karen who had
remained in the open space where we
had left them we waited eyes fixed on
the dead body and the thicket just be-
yond

  sssh there they come i whispered
then as tiny figures emerged from the
patch of jungle and cautiously ap-
proached their stricken comrade-
good heavens i ejaculated
theyre all pygmies

  my word yes and all green cried
saunderson

  wha la moaned sam they is
tha jumbies we boun fo die now
chief we-

  shut up i ordered him theyre
men pygmies

  shucks muttered red they aint
no biggern kidsvi could pick up three
of em an carry em off with one hand
say it makes me sick to think of bein
scared of them midgets

  their size has nothing to do with
the deadliness of their arrows and
slings i reminded him how many
can you count there

  eighteen announced saunderson
dont make it but seventeen de-
clared red

  i make it eighteen i said if that
is all there are we-hello theyre ex-
amining the dead body-looking at the
wound made by the bullet theyre-

ith a wailing cry the pygmies
threw themselves flat on their
faces then leaping up they scurried
off across the stream and once again
we felt as if we must be taking leave
of our senses or were dreaming for as
they fled across the shingle beach and
the pebbly sand bar the impossible green
pygmies became instantly gray

  jumbies chattered sam they
jumbies fo fac an tha tha truf

  jumbies nothin exclaimed red
theyre just human chameleons like i
said afore an plumb pizen

  saunderson chuckled oh i say old
chap whats the quichua for marvels
he asked me

  lakatona i told him why ask
aha now ive made a discovery he
cried thats the name of this place
ill wager achcacuna lakatona a
great multitude of marvels pon my
word yes

   say mister if we dont start driftin
itll be moren a multitude of marvels
if we get outer here alive im for hittin
the trail for somewhere else afore them
lizard-skinned pygmies get over their
scare an remember they aint finished us
off yet what do you say doc

   its our chance now i replied no
knowing when they may muster up
courage to come after us

  righto agreed saunderson on
our way but whereaway

   towards the other end of the valley
i replied no use in turning back there
should be a way out of here other than
by way of that chain if the civilized
men who made that passed through here
there must be another exit from the
valley its up to us to find it

  right you are cried saunderson as
he shouldered his rifle fine old slogan
that look forward not backward and
all that sort of thing dont you think
me im lookin front back and both
sides declared red with savages
what can camouflage theirselves bettern
a doodle-bug you gotta have eyes like
a injuns an keep em on the job

chapter v
the incas treasure house

we marched on across the valley
keeping a sharp watch for lurk-
ing pygmies and avoiding the
patches of jungle and the thickets as

much as possible but there was no sign
of the strange chameleon men as we
now called them although we actually
stumbled upon one of their villages i
use the word stumbled in its literal sense
for our first warning of the place was
when sam sank into the earth to his arm-
pits screaming with terror he strug-
gled to draw himself free and as we hur-
ried to his aid red and saunderson sud-
denly dropped into the ground

  by jove there must be aard-varks
here cried saunderson as he clawed his
way from the pit into which he had fal-
len never knew the beast inhabited
this part of the world

  aint no such critters declared red
as he heaved himself free just a giant
prairie dogs town thats what tis
damned queer we aint seen none of the
critters though

  i had been peering into the cavernous
hole into which sam had stumbled
youre both wrong i told them its
a town but no four-footed creatures live
here these are human habitations the
homes of those chameleon men look
here-

  stooping down the others peered into
the dark underground chamber the sides
and top had been reinforced by roughly-
woven twigs and canes on the floor of
the recess were bones and charcoal at
one side were several very crudely-made
baskets and several gourd utensils and
stuck in the wattling of the walls were
partly finished arrows

  by the lord harry youre right ex-
claimed saunderson but my word
what a place to live

  not much worsen a piute wickiup or
a navajo hogan declared red how
in blazes do them savages get in an out
aint no doors nor nothin there must
be somewhere i told him probably a
single entrance that is carefully concealed
with tunnels leading to the various cham-
bers its like an immense rabbit warren

or no-more like a moles burrow its
a discovery almost as amazing as the
people themselves why just to have
seen those pygmies and this subterran-
ean village is ample reward for the trip
i never dreamed of finding such aston-
ishing ethnological conditions

  youre welcome to em growled
red me id rather be find in some
place where i can sleep an eat without
havin arrers shot into me

  nobody at home i assume said
saunderson rising and surveying the lit-
tle clearing whose surface gave no indi-
cation of the strange village beneath
isnt it rather remarkable dont you
think that such beastly primitive beings
should possess a knowledge of making
fire and baskets

   theyre not so very primitive i re-
plied their bows and arrows prove
that they are of a type usually asso-
ciated with quite highly cultured aborig-
ines because they have adopted this re-
markable form of residence isnt neces-
sarily proof of primitive conditions the
hogans of the navajos which red men-
tioned and the rucas of the araucanians
of chile are only a degree better than
these dwellings yet the aracanians and
navajos are most intelligent and even
cultured races what puzzles me is their
amazing ability to change color-that and
their use of slings

mebbe them pygmies shiftin their
color stumps you doc but me i
dont see nothin so everlastinly funny
about it aint they plenty of critters does
the same dont lizards an tree frogs
an toads an sech things change color
cordin to where they be an if the
lord amighty fixed it for them to do the
same why the blazes shouldnt he have
fixed it for these pygmies likewise
specially as cordin to my way of
thinkin they aint much moren pizen
reptyles anyhow
through the andes



   ton my word cried saunderson
red my lad you are a never ending
source of wonder and a constant surprise
to me actually you are i never
dreamed you were a philosopher my
boy

   aint nothin of the sort declared the
texan just use common horse-sense
whats more wonderfuller about a in-
jun turnin color than a damned lizard
doin the same

  i smiled perhaps youre right red
i said after all i dont know as there
is any scientific or biological reason why
a human being shouldnt change color
its merely a question of pigment cells
being controlled by nerves which react to
certain rays of light but-

  by jove doctor i never thought of
it before but do you know this isnt the
first time ive seen human beings change
color according to their environment
what i exclaimed you mean
youve actually witnessed this phenome-
non elsewhere

  absolutely declared saunderson
ive repeatedly seen a perfectly white
skin turn scarlet-when a lady blushed
yeah an ill bet she had a hell of a
good reason to-with you around red
remarked didnt you say how twas
cording to her environment an wasnt
you that same

  sir you do me a grave injustice
laughed sanderson yet may i observe
that never have i seen a young lady blush
green at my appearance as did those sav-
ages when they saw you me lad

  aw dry up growled red an come
along

  saunderson again serious turned to
me as we cautiously picked our way
around the subterreanean village you
said the slings puzzled you he remarked
may i ask why

  because slings are not known to
primitive races as a rule i told him

among the american aborigines only
the andean tribes-those who are com-
monly classed as incan races used the
true sling oi bmicai days ut  vnvnk
i know the explanation at some period
in the past these astonishing chameleon
men have been in contact with the highly
civilized pre-incan people unquestion-
ably this valley was traversed by the pre-
incans and very probably by the later
incans the chain ladder proves that
whether these pygmies were hostile or
friendly with their civilized neighbors
makes no particular difference in the
one case they doubtless acquired a knowl-
edge of the sling when they found the
weapon on the bodies of slain pre-incans
in the other case they were probably
taught their use all of which goes to
prove-

 t tey look here doc red shouted
- interrupting my discourse i hur-
ried forward wondering what the texan
had seen

  he was gazing fixedly at the ground
before him am i seein things or is that
there a cartroad he queried as i
reached his side

  my sainted aunt it is a road abso-
lutely cried saunderson before i could
recover from my surprise sufficiently to
speak

  there was no question about it ex-
tending across a little open space was a
section of paved roadway about ten feet
in width i dropped to my knees to ex-
amine it pre-incan i announced as i
recognized the typical form of the cut
stones boys were on the verge of big
discoveries i believe hurrah well
follow the kings highway to lunnon
town cried saunderson more likely
the road to nowhere muttered red
same an all i reckon it does go to prove
theys a way outen this valley up ahead
somewhere like you said doc an the
valleys gettin narrower looks like we


amazing stories

might be cornin to another canon or
somethin

   as red said the valley was decreasing
in width where we had descended by
the chain ladder it had been fully four
miles wide and now the mountains on
either side were barely a mile apart and
were rapidly converging as we moved
onward along the centre of the now nar-
row valley we were following the ancient
road which here and there was visible

  the jolly old highway must lead
somewhere remarked saunderson
even if it began nowhere in particular
never knew a road to lead from nowhere
to nowhere you know

   unquestionably it does i agreed i
expect to find extensive ruins-probably
a ruined city at the end of the old road
an im hopin to find a way out of
this country said red me im pinin
for two things-a-plenty of good plug
tobacco an a town of christian white
folks i-heres your old ruins doc
the valley had narrowed to a mere
defile between the precipitous mountains
and stretching across the bottle-neck was
a massive stone wall that it was very
ancient was obvious and the enormous
stones of which it was built their numer-
ous angles and the mathematical pre-
cision with which they were fitted to-
gether marked it as of pre-incan work-
manship unquestionably it had once
effectually barred the pass for no hu-
man being could have scaled its slightly-
sloping smooth surface that stretched up-
ward for fifty feet above the earth and
half a dozen men protected by the ram-
parts on its summit could have held the
narrow gateway in its centre against an
army but the massive gate that once
had closed the opening had crumbled to
dust ages ago no guard or sentry chal-
lenged us and treading the smooth pave-
ment of the forgotten road we passed
through the brush-choked portal above
which were carved the characters that

  were on the golden disk beyond the wall
 the mountains receded on either hand
 and we found ourselves in a second and
 smaller valley flocks of wild fowl rose
 with frightened cries as we moved on-
 ward herds of deer and wild alpacas
 browsed on the lush grass gaudy
 macaws and parrots screamed raucously
 at us from the tree tops and the balmy
 air was filled with the scent of wild
 heliotrope and jasmine everywhere
 half-hidden amid the weeds and brush
 were remnants of stone walls buildings
 and houses as we proceeded the ruins
 became more and more numerous until
 presently we were passing through what
 once must have been a good sized city
 but even the ornately sculptured facades
 of the ancient buildings and the carved
 columns that rose amid the vines and
 trees could not draw my attention from
 what we saw ahead far up on the steep
 mountainside was an immense fortress
 its stupendous walls and battlements cut
 from the living rock which had been
 hollowed out until the cliff overhung the
 fortress so that the latter filled a gigan-
 tic niche

td jove what a piece of engi-
neering cried saunderson

  beats them cliff dwellers ruins all
 to blazes exclaimed red

  its the most marvellous thing in
america-if not in the entire world i
declared and to think weve reached
it by chance-by accident

  dont think theres anyone livin
there do you doc asked red if
there is i dunno about getting no closer
afore we know whether theyre hostyle
or not

  no fear of that i told him confi-
dently this place has been deserted
for centuries-probably thousands of
years

fascinated awed at the size and gran-
deur of the citadel and at the thought of
through the andes



the stupendous labor that must have
been involved in its making we hurried
on presently in the shadow of the
great rock curtain hundreds of feet
above our heads we came to a second
massive wall with an opening barely wide
enough to permit a single man to pass
beyond a steep pathway zigzagged up-
ward a mere groove hewn from the
rock and at each abrupt turn was a
miniature fort commanding the pas-
sageway

  great scott why one man could
hold this place against a regiment ex-
claimed saunderson and even modern
artillery couldnt smash down this
mountain

  but no man disputed our way there
was no sign of life other than the liz-
ards that scuttled over the rocks and
gazed at us with their unwinking jewel
eyes and then suddenly as we turned
one of the corners our way was barred by
a massive gate set in the low and narrow
tunnel where the pathway entered the
fortress on either side were narrow
slits some ten feet or more above our
heads like the arrow-slits in mediaeval
forts of europe

  reckon weve come to the end of the
road remarked red dont look to
me like we could bust in that door an
even karen couldnt squeeze through
them windows up there

  look i exclaimed pointing to the
rock above the gateway there are
those same symbols or characters again

  aha now i have it cried saunder-
son an advertisement-thats what
typically american you know putting
up signs all aloug the highway and
that gadget you picked up advertising
old chap advertising and here we
are with the name of the emporium over
the door must be off on a holiday
though or taking a siesta well have
to rouse them up-

  stepping forward he hammered on

the door vigorously with a lump of rock

  the next instant we sprung back as
if struck from one of the slits above
our heads came a human voice

  thin high-pitched a wraith of a
voice such a voice as one might ex-
pect from a ghost it was incredible
uncanny as if the spirit of some long-
dead inhabitant of the place had spoken
from the tomb i felt a strange prick-
ling of my scalp a tingling of my spine
saunderson stood staring mouth agape
and sams teeth were chattering like
castanets only karen and red ap-
peared unaffected by the sepulchral voice
issuing from the depths of that fortress
that i felt sure had been untennated
for centuries the malay squatted on
his haunches was whetting his kris upon
a stone and the texan his six-guns
half-drawn was squinting at the narrow
aperture whence the words appeared to
issue

  hell i thought you said there wasnt
no one here doc he muttered whats
the guy sayin  can you savvy his
lingo doc

  i silenced him with a gesture all my
attention was concentrated upon the
strange incredible voice from within the
fortress for the words coming from
out of the dead past were in the hualla
dialect the mother tongue from which
the aimara and quichua languages were
derived the sanskrit of america the
most ancient language in the new
world many of the words were un-
intelligible to me but i knew enough of
the dialect to get the meaning of what
the spirit voice was saying

  who art thou the five who come
unto achcaruna-sapi  the invisible one
demanded why dost thou some unto
the place of the dead made sacred by
the footsteps of wira kocha the cre-
ator speak and utter only words of
truth ere the wrath of the gods descends
and destroys thee


amazing stories

txtth a tremendous effort i got my

    nerves under control and moisten-
ing my lips i spoke in the quichua

  we are wanderers from afar i
replied for many days we have been
lost we have been near to starving
near to death at the hands of the little
men of the valley whose skins are like
those of the chameleon we have come
hither by chance our steps led by the
gods and by fate we seek only food
and shelter and a road whereby we may
return unto our fellow men

  for a space no words came from the
unseen being within the fortress and
rapidly and in whispers i translated what
had been said you asked what achca-
kuna meant i said to saunderson i
can tell you now he spoke of this
place as achcaruna-sapi that means
the origin or birthplace of the multi-
tudes of men the indians have cor-
rupted it to achakuna good lord do
you know what weve stumbled on the
original centre of all the civilizations of
ancient america in my opinion if
only-

  -the mysterious almost supernatural
voice interrupted my words

  it is well said the speaker now
using the quichua tongue thy words
are true for beside thee i see the red-
haired one and for long have i known
that thus events would transpire even as
foretold in the prophecy of old but
with thee also comes one who is black
of skin like that of supay the god of
evil and another who is brown like the
savages of the chaco and their pres-
ence was not foretold o man of the
beard so show unto my eyes the
sacred talisman that i may know that
all is well and the gate shall then swing
wide that thou mayest pass within

  his meaning was incomprehensible to
me that he claimed to have expected
us that our coming had been foretold
did not suprise me that was no doubt

merely a pose a gesture to make me
think he was not surprised at our pres-
ence nor did i wonder that sams skin
aroused suspicion but what on earth
did he refer to as the sacred talisman
as i hesitated wondering what i should
say how i could overcome the seeming
impasse my fingers touched the golden
disk in my pocket what impelled me
i do not know perhaps it was an in-
spiration perhaps one of those inex-
plicable flashes of a sixth sense which
we call hunches or intuition but what-
ever the cause i drew the golden pen-
dant from my pocket and held it up
and instantly as if by some magical
effect of the disk the gate swung open
and in the dark entrance of the fortress
a man stood revealed his appearance
was as spectral as his voice had seemed
tall and emaciated his back was bent by
the weight of many years his white hair
hung in plaits about his stooped shoul-
ders his face was wrinkled creased
and the color of leather while his eyes
so deep-set that they were scarcely vis-
ible gleamed and burned with the bril-
liancy and fire of youth upon his
head was an elaborate headdress of sil-
ver and feathers he was clad in a
long robe of black and red covered with
embroidery depicting the jaguar-god and
other beings of pre-incan mythology
over his shoulders was a short poncho
while about his scrawny neck was a
string of immense black and red onyx
beads separated by beads of gold and
he leaned upon a carved wooden staff
decorated with mosaic work in gold and
turquoise but i scarcely noticed these
details of costume my eyes were
focussed upon his face for he possessed
a drooping gray moustache and a long
gray beard he was the living counter-
part of the strange puzzling effigies of
the bearded god-the wira kocha or
creator-of the pre-incan races

  saundersons words broke the spell
through the andes



by jove that gew-gaw you picked up
is a genuine open-sesame he explained
no by gad its an aladdins lamp
just rub it and the genii appears
reckon money talks down here be-
hind gods back same as back home
said red whats santa claus sayin
now doc

tte wants to know why the red-
jtj headed one doesnt speak to
him i told him you appear to be
a rather important personage in his es-
timation

  shucks i cant jabber his lingo
growled red tell him i aint got
nothin to say-only im pinin for a
square meal an a plug of tobacco

  the ancient being in the doorway
bowed low and extended his arms to-
wards us in obesiance as i translated the
texans words the will of the red
haired one is law unto his servant sar-
ayaccu priest of the holy city of ach-
ctuna-sapi he said great is his
wisdom and great shall be his power
even the one of the black skin may
follow if he be the servant of the red-
haired one

  turning the priest led the way with-
in the fortress

  i think im beginning to see light
i told the others as we followed the
bent figure carrying a flaring torch he
had taken from a socket in the stone
wall there is an ancient tradition
that centuries ago-during the reign of
the inca-tupak yupanqui-it was fore-
told that after the conquest a stranger
would one day appear who would be-
come the leader of the remnants of the
incans and would rebuild their empire
and in the old prophecy it was stated
that this messiah of the race would be
a man with red hair red how would
you like to become a king

  hell i aint cravin to be no king
nor no president neither specially when

theys only a old granddaddy like him
to be king to

  i dont think you need worry over a
scarcity of subjects i told him the
priest-for he is a high priest of wira
kocha the supreme god-spoke of the
people im afraid i was away off
when i said this place was deserted i
think well find quite a population here
somewhere

  ah red my lad let me be the first
to congratulate you cried saunderson
king red the first better than
being a satyr dont you think-especially
if there are lovely ladies or-by jove
yes-a royal harem

  yeah well ill make you the kings
jester-or mebbe chief eunuch red
retorted thatll hold you for a spell
i reckon

  deeper and deeper into the very heart
of the mountain the priest led the way
the flickering light of his torch reflected
from the crystalline walls in prismatic
colors and revealing ornate carvings
everywhere cut deeply into the stone
down long flights of steps he guided us
along narrow winding passages and
vaulted corridors until finally entering
a huge chamber with frescoed walls he
paused before a mass of sculptured stone
in the center of the room bowing before
the monolith he swung the mass of rock
to one side as though it were on rollers
and revealed a trap-door set in the stone
floor

   ton my word hes about to take
us into his wine cellar ejaculated

saunderson i-

  our strange guide was speaking he
wants us to lift the door i told them

  i dunno about doin that demurred
red how we goin to know there aint
some monkey business about this meb-
be its a trick to get rid of us
nonsense i exclaimed he didnt
have to admit us did he come on
give a hand and dont be a fool red


amazing stories

  as we raised the trap-door we saw a
flight of stone steps vanishing in the
blackness below stepping forward the
priest descended the stairs and wonder-
ing whither we were bound we followed
at his heels the next instant we stood
gasping speechless with amazement
gazing in wonder at what the light of
the torch revealed on every side were
stacks and piles of yellow gold blind-
ing rays of green crimson blue and
violet were flashing at us from myriads
of gems ranged about the walls were
rows of sacred golden vessels and uten-
sils there were life-sized figures of
men and beasts wrought in solid gold
carved stone chests overflowing with
rough golden nuggets stood about and
piled to the ceiling were dull ingots of
the precious metal

reat jumpin gorrimighty ex-
claimed red in awed tones
there must be a million dollars worth
of gold here

  many millions i told him if-
my sainted aunt cried saunderson
for once abandoning his flippancy i
never would have believed there was so
much gold in the world and ive seen
the bullion in the bank of england

  i had been listening to the priests
words and now i turned to the others

  there probably isnt this amount of
gold anywhere else on earth-in any one
place i said he says that the riches
intended for the ransom of atahualpa
are here-the seven-hundred-foot gold
chain made to commemorate the birth of
the inca huascar the twelve gold statues
of the former incas the jewelled golden
trees and images of the garden of the
temple of the sun in cuzco and the
seven thousand carriers loads of gold
dust and nuggets that treasure alone
has been estimated at over one hundred
and fifty million dollars and there
are tons of gold that were placed here

ages before that roughly i should say
there are fully one thousand tons of
gold here

  shades of croesus gasped saun-
derson one thousand tons hold me
up someone my sainted aunt thats

thats-

  about half a billion dollars-as bul-
lion i told him but worth many
times as much as archaeological speci-
mens and dont forget the gems
red was staring wide-eyed open-
mouthed about the treasure chamber
say doc he said at last i reckon
ill change my mind about that king
business if all this goes with it it
must be a damned good racket but
shucks you was just kiddin of
course an-oh hell-there aint that
much money in the world

  if the red-haired one is satisfied
that the treasures of those who have
gone before have been safely guarded by
me his servant to command let us go
said the high priest turning he as-
cended the stone stairs and with our
minds in a turmoil silenced at thought
of that immeasurable hoard of gold try-
ing to convince ourselves that it was
not all a dream we followed in his
footsteps

  still dazed we replaced the trap door
the priest swung the monolith into
place bowed low before it and tap-
tapped along the labyrinth of passages
until we saw the gleam of sunlight and
a moment later stood once more in the
open air

chapter vi

in the forgotten valley

to our amazement we had emerged
at the summit of the fortress
above our heads arched the over-
hanging curtain of the mountainside as
if ready to fall at a touch far below us
was the narrow winding way leading
through the andes



from the gate to the pass where the
cyclopean wall seemed merely a gray
thread as we viewed it from our lofty
perch in the distance was the green
valley of the chameleon men and be-
yond all were the jagged upflung sum-
mits of the andean ranges

  the gray-bearded priest moved slowly
across the parapet and led us into the
shadows of the caverous hollow cut
deeply into the face of the mountain
filled with wonder at such a stupendous
work of man i gazed about it seemed
incredible that any human beings could
have carved such a gigantic artificial
cavern yet to have done so must have
been mere childs play compared to the
engineering skill and labor involved in
the hewing of the entire fortress from
the living rock saunderson voiced my
own feelings when he spoke

  by jove he exclaimed i never
felt so deucedly small in my life  pon
my word makes one realize what an in-
significant thing a man is after all

  you said it mister declared red
me i know just how a hop-toad feels
when he tumbles into a cyclone cellar

  turning aside we followed old
sarayacu down a narrow descending
pathway until rounding an abrupt turn
and ascending a sharp rise we looked
down upon a tiny bowl-like valley hidden
in a gigantic rift in the mountain

  again we stared in wonder for the
entire area of the valley was covered
with tilled fields and growing crops sepa-
rated by stone walls and dotted with
countless houses here was no dead and
deserted stop but a valley teeming with
life and industry and hidden from all
but the soaring condors in the sky my
emotions were too overwhelming to be
adequately described i had hoped to
find traces of unknown ancient civiliza-
tions in this unexplored district instead
i had found an unknown immeasurably

ancient civilization still flourishing i
had come upon some forgotten isolated
community of the pre-incans i felt
like a naturalist who in some untrodden
jungle had come face to face with living
breathing dinosaurs columbus seeing
the shores of a new-found world loom-
ing above the horizon could not have
known the wonder the elation that filled
me as i gazed down from the mountain
heights upon that tiny secret valley it
was unreal dreamlike even the gray-
bearded priest beside me seemed a
vision a figure out of the dim immeas-
urably distant past i had stepped
back for countless centuries for thou-
sands of years i had outdone mark
twains famous yankee at king
arthurs court

  i think that saunderson felt more or
less the same although of course even
he did not fully appreciate the marvel of
our surroundings not being an archae-
ologist and even red who could not
have distinguished a pre-incan from a
cholo was visibly impressed with the
wonder of coming upon a civilization
here in the heart of the andes behind
gods back as he expressed it

  of course all these sensations swept
over me in an instant-in that instant
that we stood there gazing at the valley
the next moment old sarayacu was
speaking

  behold that which no other eyes than
those of the gods have looked upon
for twice ten centuries he cried rais-
ing his staff and pointing dramatically
towards the oasis-like valley behold
all that remains of the race whose kings
ruled achcaruna-sapi and the four cor-
ners of the earth in the long ago be-
hold the homes of the chosen people of
vvira kocha the descendents of those
chavins who of all in the great city of
urkon survived look upon thy peo-
ple o red-haired one long have i
awaited thee o chosen one yea i


amazing stories

and my father before me for we of the
priest clan of achcaruna-sapi have
known that the ancient prophecy would
be fulfilled and now thou hast come
thou and thy emblem-bearer and he of
the hair of the sun yea and thy black
servant and thy brown spear-bearer
mighty are the gods and helpless is man
in the hands of destiny for that which
is to be will be unto achcaruna-sapi
thou hast come here thou wilt abide
with us and be our king to have thy
children and their childrens children sit
upon the throne of wira kocha until the
end of time as was foretold in the
prophecy

  i gasped it was as i had suspected
the old priest possessing implicit faith
in the fabulous prophecy no doubt had
watched and waited for years for the
promised arrival of the god-like being
who was to become his king according to
tradition and when we had appeared
and he had seen reds flaming thatch of
hair he had jumped to the conclusion
that the promised savior of his race had
arrived unless i was vastly mistaken
we had got ourselves into something of
a jam and we would have our hands
more than full in trying to get us out
of the mess personally of course
i shouldnt have objected to dwelling
in the place for several years no liv-
ing scientists had ever had such an op-
portunity for studying the pre-incans
but neither saunderson nor red i felt
sure would consent to remaining there
for long

  and as for red-rough restless ad-
venturer that he was and ignorant of
everything pertaining to the aborigines
unable to speak or understand quichua
-why the thought of him becoming a
native king was too preposterous for
words

  whats he lecturin about now the
subject of my thoughts enquired the
old padres been preachin a regular ser-

mon pears to me whats it all about

doc

  yes indeed do tell us the story
thats a good chap put in saunder-
son no end of a bother not being
able to gather a word that he says wish
i had learned quichua or whatever he
speaks really i do

  i repeated what sarayacu had said
but in less flowery words

  a strange expression crossed reds
face as i spoke an expression in which
incredulity wonder anger amusement
and self-satisfaction were struggling for
supremacy

  shucks the old padres just plumb
nutty he exclaimed when i had fin-
ished i aint no answer to his old
moth-eaten prophecy an i aint aimin
to stop here no longern i have to
neither i come along with you doc
an ill stick with you long as youre
wantin me but i didnt sign on to this
expedition for nothin else and if old
granddaddy here thinks im cravin to
settle down here an rear up a bunch of
half-breeds hes got-another guess
cornin to him just tell him that for
me will you doc an-oh hell
whats the use i was goin to ask you
to ask him about that damned gold he
showed us-why he showed it if he
aint goin to let us have none of it

i had never before known red to
make such a long speech i smiled
im afraid if i repeated all youve said
that we would be worse off than we are
now i told him ill handle your ab-
dication of the throne a little more diplo-
matically and i dont think it would
be advisable to mention the gold that
as i understand it goes with the crown
and if these people should once get the
idea that we are merely white men that
we place any intrinsic value on gold we
wouldnt be alive an hour later remote
and unknown as these people are they
through the andes



have heard of the spanish conquest-un-
doubtedly the news was brought here
by the carriers of atahualpas ransom
-and they would never permit a white
man to see this hidden colony and escape
to carry word of its existence to the
outside world the priest regards us as
semi-divine beings as long as we are
revered and respected as such we are
safe but if we are to continue to live
if we expect ever to get away we must
keep up that delusion so if youll leave
the matter in my hands ill try to find
some safe and sane way to solve our
problem but i can assure you both of
one thing regardless of what the
final result may be we might just as
well make up our minds to remain here

for a considerable period it-

  right-o exclaimed saunderson
youre distinctly right old man i
can quite understand that we are teeter-
ing on a tight-rope with complete ob-
livion on one hand and the life of demi-
gods and kings on the other and with
negligible expectations of being able to
maintain our balance until we reach the
end of our rope which is represented by
our own ideas of civilization as our
esteemed and elderly clerical friend ob-
served man is helpless in the hands of
destiny and that which is to be will be
positively yes im a bit of a fatalist
myself you know and after all this
isnt such a beastly sort of place
to be confined in it might prove no end
of a lark to be potentates for a bit and
seriously speaking of the two i should
much prefer being a king-or even a
court jester-to being a corpse

  sarayacu had been listening atten-
tively to our conversation and i could
see that he was beginning to get im-
patient and slightly peeved

  why does the red-haired one not
speak to his servant sarayacu in the
tongue of his people he demanded
why does he converse in strange words

with him of the hair of the sun and
with the bearded one

  o priest of achcaruna-sapi i said
-and my mind was working swiftly to
find a means of satisfying him and allay-
ing his suspicions-it is the wish of the
red-haired one to speak through the
mouth of his friend the exalted ones
speak directly only to their kind not
until the red-haired one is seated on
the throne will he deign to speak other
than through me who am his amautu
councillor have you not faith in
my words o saracayu priest of ach-
caruna-sapi have you not faith in the
one to whom the red-haired one en-
trusts the keeping of the sacred em-
blem

  the priest bowed low i am but the
servant of the mighty ones who have
come hither bearing the sacred emblem
of wira kocha and in the company of
the red-haired one he said his
will shall be the law of his people none
shall question his wisdom nor the words
of the bearded one who is his amautu

  the old man turned and stretched his
arms toward the valley where tiny dots
of human beings could be seen moving
about

nphy people await thee o red-

  a haired one he exclaimed let
us not keep them waiting longer

  following the aged priest we de-
scended toward the valley where strange
and amazing events were destined to
take place

  see here i said as we walked slowly
after the priest you fellows will have
to learn quichua ive managed to ex-
plain why you dont speak the language
now but that wont serve for very long
sooner or later youll have to speak it
or therell be trouble if you dont if
the people-and especially this priest
sarayacu discover that you are ignorant
of the language theyll be suspicious and


amazing stories

suspicions will grow to certainties dont
forget that were here under false pre-
tenses because those pretenses were
practically forced upon us doesnt alter
the case in the least now were here
weve got to see it through and the
sooner you two can speak some quichua
the better for all of us even if you
could only say a few words such as
it is well yes and no and some
common forms of salutations it would
be a tremendous help and youll find
quichua a fairly easy language to
learn

  right-o agreed saunderson
whatever you say old chap mine not
to question why mine not to make reply
mine but to do or die and all that sort
of thing you know but seriously im
not such a duffer at picking up a
language i speak malay and hin-
dustani and a bit of burmese et cetera
when does the first lesson begin
reckon i can manage it declared
red mebbe i wont never get to sling
the lingo grammatic-like but i savvy
spanish an apache an some navajo
an i dont reckon this quichuas no
harder than them

  fine i exclaimed better start
right now if sarayacu overhears us
all the better he wont know im teach-
ing you the words but hearing you
speak them hell think youre familiar
with quichua as i am

  so for the next fifteen minutes i
drilled the two in the proper use and
pronunciation of a few simple phrases
and words

  how in blazes we goin to know
when to use em asked red if i
dont savvy what theyre sayin to me
how in hell can i answer em right
dont try i told him unless im
with you then i can tip you off what
to say

  saunderson chuckled my word
he exclaimed i dont envy you your

job old man really you know you
should be the prime minister you
have your hands full interpreter-in-
chief mouthpiece of his majesty king
red the first prompter extraordinary
contact man advisory committee bearer
of the royal seal or whatever it is
master of ceremonies et cetera et
cetera

  say mister quit that line of talk
about me being a king growled red
i aint no king an i aint goin to be
one neither not less its goin to save
our skins bein one

  rabid republican grinned saunder-
son doesnt all that vast treasure
tempt you to become a monarchist my
lad by jove if i had hair that was
rufus id jump at the opportunity pos-
itively

  we were now approaching the valley
and were moving along a smooth well-
kept road that led down the foothills
by an easy gradient on every side
were orchards of fruit trees and neatly
terraced gardens and here and there
a stone or adobe hut stood embowered
by climbing vines and ornamental trees
everywhere too were the people men
and women toiling in the fields and gar-
dens spinning or weaving in their door-
days or tending flocks of alpacas llamas
and immense long-haired goats as we
approached the first of these herds
saunders gripped my arm

reat scott doctor do you see
those he cried indicating the
dun-colored goats dont you recog-
nize them theyre those mythical
andean goats of the indians tales by
jove yes no doubt about it oh my
sainted aunt to think ive hunted all
over the andes trying to get a shot at
one of the beasts and here they are by
the hundreds-domesticated

  well you aint got no kick cornin
far as i can see grinned red you
through the andes



can shoot all you want of em here an
no trouble neither

  saunderson for once could find no
adequate words with which to reply

  but i realized how he must feel at
finding the almost fabulous creatures
were merely domestic animals here for
i felt much the same in regard to the
people who were hurrying forward from
all directions as we proceeded on our
way they might have been painted
figures from pre-incan pottery come to
life all were dressed as the aborigines
had dressed centuries before the con-
quest the men in sleeveless tunics
reaching to the knees and short-legged
drawers the women in loose full skirts
of knee length and with poncho-like
capes over their bare shoulders and
breasts all were gay with color all
wore ornaments of silver and gold and
all differed amazingly from any andean
indians i had seen instead of being
short and stocky they were tall and
splendidly proportioned their features
were clear cut their foreheads high and
broad their noses high-bridged and
slightly aquilline and their eyes alert
keen and hazel-gray and not a single
brown-skinned individual could i see
mostly they were a light olive some
were what we would call swarthy but
many were as fair as any european
brunette never have i seen a more
universally happy and contented-looking
lot and with obeisances and salutations
with showers of flowers and shouts of
gladness they welcomed us rapidly news
of our coming had spread and soon we
were surrounded by the laughing joy-
ous but slightly-awed throng and like
a triumphal procession we moved on-
ward between the neatly-walled fields of
alfalfa and maize potatoes and peanuts
toward a group of larger buildings now
visible in the shelter of a grove of tow-
ering mapoya trees ablaze with crimson
blooms

  by jove isnt this perfectly rip-
ping cried saunderson its as jolly
as the lord mayors show and the
ladies my word some of them are
beauties oh i say red my lad if
you decide to abdicate just do me a
favor old top and name me as your
successor to the throne

  red secretly as much surprised and
pleased at the ovation and the people
as any of us grinned i dunno about
that mister sun hair he said some
of these nice little girlies might be
sorta disappointed if they didnt have a
red-head for a king

  sarayacus voice stopped further con-
versation behold o red-haired one
we draw near unto thy home be-
hold how thy people welcome thee
great is the joy of the people of ach-
caruna-sapi this day

  i nudged reds elbow nows your
chance i muttered tell him it is
well

  as red uttered the simple phrase he
  had just learned the priests face
beamed at last the red-haired one
had spoken directly to him he felt tre-
mendously honored and it suddenly
dawned upon me that reds inability to
converse in quichua had helped rather
than hindered matters

  my thoughts were interrupted by our
arrival at the group of buildings in the
grove i could have shouted with joy
for at my first glance at the imposing
structures a thousand problems and
puzzles that hitherto had confronted
archaeologists were instantly solved
scores hundreds of times i had studied
the crumbling ruins of pre-incan build-
ings striving to recreate them to picture
them as they had been when occupied
but in vain and now before me were
exactly similar buildings complete in
perfect repair tenanted behind the


amazing stories

wall of titanic stones rose structures
that might have been those of tia-
huanaco in the heyday of that immeas-
urably ancient city to the right the
severely plain but massive citadel to the
left the elaborately-sculptured magni-
ficent palace and in the background on
its pyramidal mound the imposing
temple there before us as we
passed through the outer portal was a
monolithic arch the counterpart of the
gateway of the sun of tiahuanaco
and beyond it the level stone-paved
concha or plaza surrounded by hundreds
of carved stone columns each capped
with a symbolic figure wrought in solid
gold what stupid fools we modern
archaeologists had been i thought
always we had assumed that the tenon-
like tops of the tiahuanco columns had
been designed to receive lintels of wood
or stone never had it occurred to us
that they were made to support golden
images but another revelation was to
come men clad in gorgeous ceremonial
costumes debouched up on the plaza and
quickly took positions one before each
of the gold-topped columns another
puzzle was solved the monoliths
marked the stations of the nobles of
the community the gold figures were
the totems of the great ones strange
that such a simple explanation had never
occurred to any scientist and now a
hushed silence fell over the assembled
throng and sarayacu taking a step for-
ward held high his hands and with such
a gesture as the prophet moses might
have used he blessed the multitude
then behold o people of ashcaruna-
sapi thy prayers have been answered and
the ancient prophecy has been fulfilled
this day unto us has come the red-
haired one to take his seat upon the
sacred throne of wira kocha with
him has come his amautu the bearded
one and his warrior chieftain the one
with the hair of the sun and to

serve them have come one with the black
skin of supay and one of brown
blessed are we of achcaruna-sapi fav-
ored are we by the gods no more shall
we of the chavins be without a king
no longer shall the amaru-huay beset
us and exact the tribute of virgins no
longer shall we fear the powers of dark-
ness and of evil for the red-haired one
has come from beyond the barriers of
the great mountains he has come with
the bearded one and the one of the
hair of the sun through the valley of
the little men and he and his trusted
ones are immortal and indomitable and
great indeed is their wisdom aye and
they bear with them the sacred symbol
of wira kocha that no man has looked
upon for twice ten centuries behold
my people the amautu of the red-
haired one will hold aloft the emblem
that all may see

  i did not need to be prompted step-
ping to the priests side i held high the
golden disk and turned it about so that
all might see it a deep indrawn breath
of awe that was almost a sigh arose from
the hundreds of people i nudged red
say something i commanded him
let them hear your voice tell them
it is well jabber some apache or navajo
or anything else afterwards and put in
all the quichua words ive taught you
its-

  speech  shouted saunderson clap-
ping his hands speech red my lad
iba ishti kampisjinallactac ama and all
that sort of thing you know

  speech

  the effect of his meaningless gibber-
ish his string of quichua words and in-
comprehensible english and his hand-
clapping was astounding the people
fairly roared with approbation and
thinking no doubt that hand-clapping
was some important mystical ceremony
they instantly followed suit and the ap-
plause was deafening
through the andes



but as red stepped forward all
sounds were instantly hushed all
eyes were focussed upon him all ears
were strained to catch his words ma-
tapacuy pakunarem ka aamuy-oh
hell whats next doc o k ra-ama
inga kaicho tengo much gusto senores
y senoritas yo soy hombre tnuy
shucks you dont none of you know
what im tryin to say nohow kach-
arpani

  amid a thunder of applause in which
the newly acquired custom of hand-
clapping almost drowned the shouting
red stepped back wiping the beads of
perspiration from his flushed face

  whew he ejaculated damned if
that wasnt the hardest thing ever i been
called on for to do holy catfish 
hope i aint gotta make no more
speeches any speeches as has to be
made you go ahead an say em doc
what the blazes did i say anyhow
balderdash replied saunderson
not even a lot of tommy-rot you
started off gloriously you know-so de-
lighted to be here and all that sort of
thing but after that-by jove its
lucky they dont know what you did say
absolutely yes

  yeah well i bet you didnt say noth-
in any more sensible when you begun to
shoot off your mouth growled red
how about it doc

  far be it from me to become involved
in the controversy i replied but
im beginning to think that a little
knowledge is a most valuable rather
than a dangerous thing here if these
people can understand a word here and
there but cant make head or tail of
the rest of the words theyre a lot more
impressed than if you spoke perfectly
intelligible quichua or even hualla its
a queer psychological quirk but per-
fectly natural anything they cant un-
derstand savors of mysticism and
every mothers son of them is going to

pretend he understands for fear of others
thinking him ignorant

  my word i do believe youre right
agreed saunderson human nature is
much the same the world over you
know yes by jove its precisely the
same way with an audience in a lecture-
hall in jolly old england or the states
catch any of them permitting their
neighbors to suspect they dont grasp the
lecture chaps meaning but-oh i
say here comes the chorus

  at the opposite end of the plaza a pro-
cession of girls appeared all dressed
alike in garments of scarlet and black
and ablaze with gold chanting a song
and scattering flowers they advanced
four abreast knelt and made obeisance
before us and then rising turned to
right and left and took positions around
the sides of the open space

  saunderson touched my arm i say
old chap who are they he asked
ladies of the harem or the royal
ballet

  i shook my head im not sure i
told him probably virgins of the
temple or merely feminine members of
the nobility i-

  an exclamation from red that was
almost a gasp drew our attention he
was staring almost reverentially at one
of the girls who was approaching him
there was no denying that she was a
very lovely creature her skin was the
color of old ivory her figure revealed
by the turned-back cape was that of a
nymph rather than a venus her large
lustrous eyes were shaded by long thick
lashes her brows were perfect arches
her lips parted in a provocative smile
showed even pearly teeth and she
walked with the regal tread of a queen
but it was not her glorious young
beauty that held our eyes beneath the
llantu that encircled her head her hair
fell in two long plaits of deep titian
red


amazing stories

jove what a beauty exclaimed
- saunderson under his breath
and red haired where on earth did

she come from i say-

  the girl was kneeling almost at reds
feet with bated breath as if in a
trance he was staring at her as if she
had been a vision or a goddess the
next instant she rose cast one quick
sidelong glance at him from under her
lowered lids and moved aside to make
room for the next four girls

  red reached a shaking hand and
touched me while still keeping his eyes
fixed upon the girl did you see her
doc he gasped i aint never fell for
no woman afore but she got me there
aint no other on earth like her who
the blazes is she doc ask the old
padre what her name is an where she
lives i gotta see her again if i have
to shoot up the whole damned place to
do it

  i turned to sarayacu the red-
haired one wishes to know the name of
the virgin with hair like unto his own
i told him

  the priests face fairly beamed
favored indeed is the house of saray-
acu he exclaimed she of the red
hair is cherisona the daughter of my
daughter her father was the noble
kopa cahuana of the royal clan of ur-
kon long have i prayed unto the gods
that when the red-haired one came to
achcaruna-sapi even he might look with
favor upon cherisona and that she
might sit by his side upon the throne of
her fathers fathers and that their chil-
dren might rule forever over our
people

  the young lady is named cherisona
i told red she is sarayacus grand-
daughter a princess of royal blood and
a candidate for the position of queen it

appears-

is that straight doc demanded
interrupting my words you mean

if im king of this place i can-oh
shucks she wouldnt never marry me
dont worry over that i said i
can assure you that you have merely to
ask her and shell jump at the chance
if im any judge of human nature and
femininity shes aching for the chance to
say yes 

  saunderson chuckled ah but dont
forget red my lad that you cant con-
verse with the young lady or ask her
hand and heart until you have acquired
a more comprehensive knowledge of
her language but honestly my boy
you are a deucedly lucky dog you
know

  the hell of a lot you know about
it snapped red makin loves the
same in all lingos

  right distinctly right agreed
saunderson ive had some little ex-
perience myself you know and i can
assure you that jolly little cupid has
evolved the most perfect esperanto ever

devised but-

  doc exclaimed red ignoring the
others flippancy i changed my mind
im just cravin to be made king tell
the padre that im just rarin to go im
ready to be initiated into this king busi-
ness any time hes ready hell id be
king of a bunch of lousy piutes if i
could get spliced to that cherimoya
girl not cherimoya cherisona i
corrected him o k doc cherisona

he continued i-

  dont forget that if you go through
with this youll probably be here for
life i reminded him there may be
a way out for us without sacrificing your
liberty

  sacrifice hell he cried great

chapter vii
the palace of the king

 heres something i dont un-
derstand yet i said as the
 jrowd dispersed and sarayacu
led us across the plaza to the palace
theres some mystery i havent been
able to fathom

  saunderson laughed everything
here is no end of a mystery to me
he declared that amazing great fort-
ress the treasure how these people have
survived here without being discovered
that stunning princess with the titian
hair and most of all why they should
desire red for their king

  all astonishing but scarcely mys-
teries i told him even the red hair
of cherisona is not mysterious-it is not
uncommon to find incan and pre-incan
mummies with red hair what i had in
mind is something entirely different a
mystery-or perhaps better several mys-
terious things which taken together lead
me to think there is something deeper
something hidden that we havent hit
upon yet

  really what is this jolly old mys-
tery of yours he asked im fear-
fully keen on mysteries myself-read
all those silly old mystery magazines
you know

  doesnt it strike you as rather strange
that these people are without a ruler-
a king or queen-when there are plenty
of men and women of royal blood if we
are to believe sarayacu i asked him
then again isnt it something of mys-
tery that i should have picked up that
gold disk which proved to be the sacred
symbol of these people how did it
happen to be there surely any one

possessing such a priceless all powerful
talisman would never have dropped it
and failed to search for it another
mystery to my mind is the presence of
that chain by which we entered the val-
ley if it was designed to enable people
to scale the cliff why was it drawn up
so that no one could reach the canyon
from here but people approaching by
the trail could get here whoever car-
ried that symbol i found was either go-
ing from this place or if coming to-
ward it he never reached the chain
ladder i--

  i aint no detective said red in-
terrupting my words but i reckon i
know the answer to that one didnt
you say that gold was brought here by
a bunch of injuns so the spaniards
wouldnt get their hands onto it  well
did them injuns stay here ill bet they
didnt cordin to my way of thinkin
they cleared out an went home an twas
them fellows hauled the chain up after
em an most likely ltst that emblem you
found they must ha had one with
em to get in here in the first place an
if they wasnt aimin to come back they
wouldnt bother much if they lost it
an someone cut down that old bridge
what we dumb up on them ropes was
sound an hadnt rotted through pears
like to me them fellers aimed to fix
things so nobody else could get in here
an grab the gold an so the folks here
couldnt get out to tell about it bein hid
here

  by the lord harry i never thought
it of you red exclaimed saunderson
why my lad youre a second sherlock
holmes absolutely yes by jove do
you know i actually think you have hit
upon the solution of that mystery

  i think it quite probable that does
explain some of it i agreed and i
can quite see how saracayu knowing
that the treasure carriers were to close
the trail behind them should be all the


amazing stories

more convinced of our semi-divine char-
acters because we reached here but
there is another thing which the priest
mentioned which puzzles me when he
was addressing the people here in the
plaza he said no longer shall the
amaru-huay beset us and exact the
tribute of virgins no longer shall we
fear the powers of darkness and evil
those were no idle words i am sure
these people have some very terrible
enemy either real or imaginary he
spoke of it as the amaru-huay that
means a dragon as nearly as it can be
translated but of course that was a
figure of speech signifying something
terrifying and unconquerable whatever
it is it calls for human sacrifices-for
the tribute of virgins it may be that
girls are sacrificed to some evil deity or
again it may be that some savages must
be propitiated by giving them young
girls just as soon as i feel we are
firmly established im going to find
out

teah an if im king of this bunch
x you can bet there wont be no sac-
rificing of girls to heathen gods nor
nothin else declared red if im
boss im goin to run things cordin to
my ideas an theyre a-goin to stand for
it an like it

  bully for you cried saunderson
slapping him on the back im all for
you red my lad and if your majesty
requires assistance call on me nothing
i love better than a good fight you
know no end of a lark-knocking the
blighters about in a righteous cause
fightins all right agreed red but
what im cravin right now is grub and
tobacco say doc ask the padre if he
cant rustle some i seen some of them
men smokin when we was standin in
the plaza sufferin cats whats this
a hotel

  we had reached the palace and pass-

ing between the intricately-sculptured
columns flanking the doorway on whose
lintel were cut the same mystic inscrip-
tion i have already described we found
ourselves in a corridor or collonade that
extended around an immense patio or
garden it was i think the most beau-
tiful patio i have ever seen the beds
of flowering plants the ornamental
shrubs the neatly kept hedges the vines
clamboring over the palm trees all were
ablaze with color the air was heavy
with the odor of thousands of blossoms
and vibrant with the music of bright-
plumaged songbirds paths paved with
mosaics of jade lapis lazuli jasper
onyx malachite cinnabar amethyst and
other semi-precious stones were shaded
by flowering trees here and there were
arbors of summer houses enbowered in
vines gorgeous butterflies and jewel-
throated humming birds hovered over
the flowers and in the centre of the
garden was an immense bathing pool of
sea-green serpentine filled with running
water flowing from a tilted urn held by
a nude female figure wrought of solid
gold

  of course i did not note all these de-
tails at that time we had scarcely
more than a glimpse of the patio as we
passed down the corridor and followed
saracayu through a doorway closed by a
magnificent tapestry and found our-
selves in an immense room evidently
word had been sent that we were to
dine for a meal had been prepared for
us and food in golden and silver dishes
was being served by white-clad women
as we entered

  by jove makes me think of lyons
pop on dear old piccadilly exclaimed
saunderson all these waitresses in
white you know but my word even
frascatis isnt so gorgeous

  if the grub eats as good as it smells
its all right by me was reds com-
ment say doc how in blazes we
through the andes



goin to eat without no knives an
forks 

  fingers my lad fingers saunderson
told him when a man has an oppor-
tunity to dine from dishes of solid gold
he shouldnt be particular about the cut-
lery

  as was the custom with the incans
each person had a separate table or
rather a bench and seating ourselves
on the low stools provided we lost no
time in satisfying our truly ravenous ap-
petites but despite my hunger i found
my attention was more upon my sur-
roundings than upon the food and
i scarcely could keep my eyes from the
elaborate frescoes in red and black
which completely covered the walls of
the dining hall but the attentions of
the others were entirely upon the food
served them by the demure sandal-shod
girls it was a really excellent meal
there were luscious fruits-the native
peaches or duraznos the pale pink
andean strawberries cherimoyas and
bananas there was a soup with paltas
or as we call them alligator pears
boiled green corn lima beans potatoes
and some sort of greens formed the
vegetable course for entrees there were
roasted cavy or guinea pig and broiled
quail and for desert there were fried
corn-cakes with honey and of course
there was the cider-like com chicha as a
beverage

  ton my word i never dined more
sumptuously in my life declared sund-
derson when at last he had finished
now if only i had an after dinner
havana i-

  me i aint cravin no seegar said
red i want a good chaw say doc
ask the padre if he cant rustle some
tobacco

  the priest nodded and gave an order
when i asked him and a moment later
a servant appeared carrying what looked
like a section of cylindrical black wood

red sniffed at it suspiciously
damned if taint tobacco he
cried and drawing his knife he hacked
off a piece and stuffed it into his mouth
a satisfied grin spread over his features
as his jaw worked whoopee he ex-
claimed there aint nothin more im
wantin nice friendly lot of people
good grub plenty of tobacco a swell

hotel and-

  dont forget a crown and a queen
saunderson reminded him

 red leaped to his feet holy
smokes he exclaimed im goin for
to look her up now if there was only

a movie we could go to-

  hold on i admonished him dont
be precipitate remember you are a
semi-divinity that you-all of us-are
revered and that our lives depend upon
maintaining our present status if you
behave like an ordinary mortal well
lose prestige even if we dont lose our
lives and dont think im exaggerating
these people are aware of the fate of
their race at the hands of the spaniards
they have cut themselves off from the
world and have remained hidden away
here to avoid a similar fate and they
would never permit a white man to carry
word of their existance to the rest of
the world aside from all this is the
outstanding fact that as king-elect you
could scarcely wander about looking for
a young lady regardless of her social
status

  i reckon i gotta do as you say doc
growled red but hell cant a king
do what he wants to

  he cannot saunderson told him
most distinctly not thats the penalty
for being a king you know uneasy
lies the head that wears a crown and
all that sort of thing in return for the
privilege of sitting on a throne one has
to make concessions can you imagine
good old king george wandering about
buckingham palace in a bath robe and


amazing stories

slip-slops with a pipe in his mouth or
sitting on a bench in hyde park and
holding hands with a flapper no it
simply isnt done red my lad but
ill wager a quid to a sixpence jolly old
georgie would give the kohinoor to be
able to chuck the whole show and be
just a man even as you and  abso-
lutely yes

  red sighed aint there no way i
can get to see that cheri-cherisona
girl again an have a chance to get ac-
quainted he asked cant i throw
a party or a dance or something an in-
vite her im takin on this king job
account of her cant you ask the padre
if he cant fix it up

  no i will not i told him rather
annoyed at his insistence im handling
this matter as i think best for all of us
sarayacu is as anxious as you are to
arrange a match with you and his grand-
daughter but these people have their
conventions and customs like every other
race youve got to abide by them i
dont know any more about such matters
than you do but i dont propose to
make a mess of everything by saying or
doing anything that will reveal our ig-
norance now-

  sarayacu suggesting that if we had
satisfied our appetites we should follow
him interrupted our conversation sam
and karen who had been served with
food in the patio awaited us in the cor-
ridor

  wha la exclaimed sam how we
goin arrange chief ah cant com-
prehen wha these people says an

they cant comprehen me an ah-

  well fix that i assured him ill
see that you and karen are near us at
all times

the priest led us through a second
doorway opening on to the patio
and we found ourselves in a spacious
chamber with wralts completely covered

with magnificent tapestry hangings
never had i seen such textiles even
the famed robes of the parakas tombs
would have appeared cheap and tawdry
by comparison thick soft rugs of vis-
cacha and alpaca covered the floor
there were stools and benches of richly
carved dark wood inlaid with precious
metal and turquoise a wisp of sweet-
scented smoke drifted from a silver in-
cense burner resting on a stand of carved
jadeite and at one side was a couch
with coverings of textiles as fine and
light as silk

  may the bearded one make this
humble chamber his own said saray-
acu if there is anything lacking
which he may require it shall be his
if he but speaks his wishes

  my word they do you rather well
you know exclaimed saunderson oh
i say what jolly pajamas he was
examining garments that filled a carved
wooden chest

  i laughed not pajamas full dress
i told him apparently we are ex-
pected to follow conventions even in
clothing

  sufferin snakes you goin to wear
them things cried red me i-

  youll wear whatever they give you
and like it i told him in the first
place well be less conspicuous in the
second place it will save wear and tear
on our own garments which are peril-
ously near the end of their usefulness
already and in the third place the
more we fall into the natives ways the
better clothes may not make the man
but they make a big impression on other
men

  well im a-goin to tote my six-guns
no matter wrhat duds i wear he de-
clared

  no harm in that i told him these
people dont know what a gun is so they
will probably think yours are ceremonial
objects or some sort of insignia
through the andes



   i turned to sam this is my room
i told him you can stay here no
sense in trailing along after us

   the priest conducted us to another
chamber almost the counterpart of the
first which he informed us was for the
use of the lord of hair of the sun
or as he expressed it inchukespi

   saunderson gave an order to karen
who squatted in the doorway as we left
the room and followed the priest across
the patio to where two men clad in
sky-blue and white and armed with
long-handled bronze axes stood guard
outside a curtained door way the sen-
tries lowered their weapons in salute as
we approached and dropped to one knee
as we passed between them through the
portal and the end of a short hall-
way sarayacu paused before a heavy
drapery may this chamber find favor
in the eyes of the red-haired one he
said as he parted the arras

   the room we entered was indescrib-
ably magnificent the walls bare of
hangings were completely covered with
mosaic pictures wrought in semi-precious
stones and gold upon the floor of ex-
quisite tiles were beautiful rugs and the
skins of andean bears jaguars ocelots
and panthers the insense burner and
its stand were of massive gold ablaze
with diamonds and the stools and
benches were richly inlaid with gold and
encrusted with emeralds garnets topaz
and sapphires and in the centre of the
chamber was a fountain in the form of a
golden lily with a bowl cut from a single
immense block of translucent pale
green fluorspar to the right was a
door closed by a curtain of gorgeous
feather work by jove the royal bed-
chamber cried saunderson as he lifted
the drapery and peered within

  this room was if anything more re-
 gal than the other deep rich rugs of
 white and blue covered the floor the
 walls were completely hidden under

  feather-work tapestry the stools were
of gold set with gems and the couch of
richly-carved and inlaid wood was cov-
ered with robes made entirely of the
irridescent feathers of humming birds

  sufferin snakes have i gotta sleep
in here exclaimed red staring about
in awed bewilderment hell it aint no
sort of a room for a he-man i feel
like i was sleepin in a bank vault or a
jewlry shop say doc am i seein things
or is all this real honest-to-goodness
gold holy smoke if i had just one
of these tables back home id be fixed
for life

  youll be fixed for life-here if
you become king i reminded him no
backing out of the job once you are
crowned sure you want to go ahead
with it

  he wheeled on me look a-here
doc he cried vehemently i aint
never went back on nothin i said yet
as long as that cherisona girl is here
you couldnt pry me loose short of a
blast of dynamite

lvf y word what a wardrobe ex-
vj claimed saunderson who was
examining the contents of a sculptured
lapis-lazuli chest my sainted aunt it
would make an indian rajah green with
envy red my lad youll be perfectly
gorgeous when you appear arrayed in
these togs every girl will be running
after you positively yes

  yeah retorted red well you can
have the job of roundin em up an
mebbe thatll keep you busy for a spell
thanks awfully your majesty
grinned saunderson but far be it
from me to prevent the dears from gaz-
ing upon their king arrayed unto the
lilies of the field and with forty-fives
strapped to his cute little panties

  say mister exclaimed red if
there wasnt no other reason id take
this king job so i could tell you where


amazing stories

you get off savvy but all this meant
come along boys i said were
keeping sarayacu waiting he has other
wonders to exhibit

   ton my word hes missed his voca-
tion absolutely declared saunderson
he should be with cooks or lunds you
know one of those conductor chaps who
show tourists about the old churches and
palaces and all that sort of thing
opposite the door through which we
had entered the main room was an im-
posing portal flanked by columns of red
onyx sculptured to represent entwined
serpents and supporting a lintel of black
agate showing the condor-god in high
relief drawing aside the curtain heavy
with gold embroidery the priest ushered
us into an enormous hall or open
court for only a portion of one end of
the place was roofed over in the
shelter of the roof upon a raised stone
dais was a massive chair or throne of
deep-blue lapis with the arms ending in
jaguar heads of gold to the right of
this was a smaller throne of rich green
jadeite while on the left was a third
throne of rose quartz above the central
throne a golden condor spread its broad
wings like a canopy back of the green
throne was a great golden sun and be-
hind the throne of pink was a conven-
tionalized moon of silver and the
magnificence of the three thrones in
their setting of gleaming gold was
heightened by the fact that elsewhere
the vast room was absolutely devoid of
ornamentation the walls of immense
many-angled blocks of pale-gray diorite
were without a trace of carving or sculp-
ture with one exception cut deeply into
the wall above the soaring condor was
the mysterious inscription of eighteen
strange characters or symbols

y jove its the most imposing
throne-room ive ever seen de-
clared saunderson in lowered voice

but why the three thrones that per-
fectly gorgeous blue and gold one for
the king of course one of the others
for the queen dont you think but
who occupied the third i cant imagine

  the symbols behind each answers
that question i told him the pink
throne with the moon is that of the
queen the green one with the sun is
for the high priest-our friend saray-
acu

  saunderson chuckled  ton my
word he explained dropping his seri-
ous manner and reverting to his irrepres-
sible flippancy i dont envy good old
red his job the parson on one side
and a woman on the other-jolly well
between the devil and the deep sea as
one might say

  well i aint worryin none long as
i dont have you settin alongside me
red told him

  i turned to sarayacu tell me o
priest of urkon why no ruler sits upon
the throne of wira kocha awaiting
the coming of the red-haired one has
achcaruna-sapi had no king nor queen
to guide the people

  the old priest shook his head sadly
for half a thousand years no man of
chavin blood has been crowned king of
achcaruna-sapi he replied and no
woman may sit upon the sacred throne
of wira kocha when manko kelendin
went forth with his warrior hosts to
serve beneath the rainbow standard of
the inca and met his death the line of
chavin kings came to an end yet was
it so foretold in the ancient prophecy
and knowing that what is to be will be
we of achcaruna-sapi have awaited the
day when huata piclu the red-haired
one should arrive to sit upon the sacred
throne and mate with a woman of
chavin blood and beget a man-child
with red hair of the royal line that
their children and their childrens chil-
dren might forever be kings in urkon
through the andes



  my thirst for knowledge was getting
the better of my caution and heedless
of the fact that i might be expected to
possess knowledge of such matters i
questioned him further

  you speak in riddles o sarayacu
i told him you speak of urkon and
of achcaruna-sapi and of the chavins
though i am the amautu of the red-
haired one yet i come from afar and
there is much that i do not understand
are urkon and achcaruna-sapi and
chavin but different names for this one
valley and this one people

  the priest smiled there is much
that i may tell you o bearded one
he said that you know naught of
these matters is not strange nay even
the red-haired one himself understands
them not nor does he speak our tongue
with ease for so it was ordained and
foretold in the long ago and now it is
the hour of rest and my lords have
journeyed far and are wearied
theres one thing we neednt worry
about i told the others as we left the
throne-room and paused for a moment
in reds quarters sarayacu knows
that red doesnt speak the language-

says it was foretold by the prophecy that
he would be a stranger so we need
not be afraid to ask questions or let the
priest and the others know we are ig-
norant of many things that makes it
much easier as soon as i can man-
age it ill have a long talk with saray-
acu and find out all i can

  clever beggar the parson declared
saunderson no end of a sly old fox
i should say shouldnt be surprised if
he knows us for what we are and is just
spoofing the public with his prophecies
and all that sort of thing

  possibly i agreed but im in-
clined to think he actually believes in
it all it is almost impossible for a
white man to understand the mental at-
titude or psychology of the aborigines
superstition a belief in the occult in-
telligence intuition and keen perception
and common sense are all inextricably
blended in their brains

 red yawned anyhow that cheri-
sona girl aint no fake he declared
an there aint nothin phoney about
this room or this bed me im for hit-
tin the hay an takin a good long
snooze

cryptography

most elaborate systems of secret writing have been devised but it is
probable that any system can be deciphered by a student of the very diffi-
cult subject and of the methods employed in the story of the gold bug
a very simple example is given of a cryptogram or secret writing for that is
the meaning of the word its deciphering was based on the relative frequency of
letters in english language texts in the printers art the same proposition comes
up a font or fount of type means a set comprising all the individual types
required to print any text it would clearly be useless to have as many xs or
ys in a font as there are es and ts the reader can count the es in a few
lines of any text and then in the same line count other letters and he will find
a great difference in the font of type the following figures give the relative
number of letters approximately to be expected it will be of interest to crypto-
grammists

buried in space

     by lawrence smith

nature holds out to man her
secrets locked in her clenched
hands and she has but one finger
open at a time so said that dis-
tinguished astronomer and writer ca-
mille flammarion who during his life
entertained multitudes of americans
with his graceful pen one by one sci-
entists had pried open those reluctant
fingers and found there the art of
navigating the air the wondrous radio
the x-ray they had penetrated into
the close-locked atom and revealed the
marvels therein the cold and black
depths of the sea had been explored and
the barren wastes of the poles had been
made familiar to the world there was
no place upon earth that man had not
set foot on and he now turned his at-
tention and his inventive genius to
travel in interplanetary space and the
problem of neutralizing the earths at-
traction which had thus far held man as
though in bands of steel to her bosom

  it had long been assumed that gravity
was an electrical manifestation and that
it belonged in the field of magnetism
working on this theory a dr alison of
the laboratory of the international elec-
tric corporation had succeeded by the
use of a high speed generator and the
liberal use of certain of the rarer ele-
ments in so changing the molecular
structure of steel as to render it neutral
to the attraction of the earth by means
of this discovery and the centrifugal
force of the earth great hollow steel
globes carrying scores of sightseers were
carried to the surface of the moon and
journeys there had now become com-
monplace

  on this particular morning dr ali-
son who was a stockily built silver-

haired sort of a grandfather type was
sitting in the library of the steel man-
ufacturers club in new york in com-
pany with two prominent steel magnates
-mr dobbs of the continental and
mr barry of the consolidated these
corporations had recently been awarded
contracts for a number of the steel
globes used in voyaging to the moon
and their presidents were now closing a
discussion with the inventor as to cer-
tain technicalities in their manufactures
this business being cqpduded the con-
versation turned to the commercial value
of certain minerals which had been
found upon the moon they included
immense deposits of salt sulphur alum
and gypsum dr alison pointed out
that these minerals were also abundant
upon the earth and they were hardly
valuable enough to warrant their trans-
portation for so great a distance

  nevertheless objected the well-
groomed barry i think the day is close
at hand when it will be commercially
profitable to bring even sulphur here it
is nothing short of marvelous that a
voyage of about  miles is made
in jess than two weeks with the maxium
of safety and ease and at relatively lit-
tle cost the passenger enters one of
these globes and lounges about in com-
fortable cabins and sleeps in luxurious
berths if he does not look through an
observation port he never knows when
the ship starts or when it lands for there
is no perception of change of movement
any more than we know that we are
moving on the earth it is safer and
simpler to make a voyage to the moon
than it is to ride from new york to
san francisco on a steam railroad

  it was not always that way said the
buried in space



inventor laying down a scientific mag-
azine the first trip was awful
there was always the fear that we had
provided insufficient insulation against
the absolute zero of interstellar space
after we left the earth there was a
sickening feeling of insecurity and un-
certainty and the constant fear that the
generators would fail and we would
fall back to the earth it was appalling
no doubt replied mr barry but
that is all past now and the trip is safer
than most journeys on earth there is
absolutely nothing to puncture the shell
for meteorites are either too few or too
small to regard and the moon has no
satellite to bump into

 pardon me said the inventor
but the moon has a satellite it is
a very small one however and there is
little danger of a collision with it
the astronomers have never found
one replied mr barry

  they will never find this one either
answered the scientist

  too small no doubt a small rock
i daresay mr barry folded his arms
satisfied that he had solved this problem
no it is not a rock

 what is it then you must have
passed near it on your first voyage
not at all we were the authors of
this satellite we produced it

  i know what it is said the jolly
mr dobbs it is a piece of machinery
from the ship discarded while en route
or a part of the equipment

  yes replied dr alison thought-
fully in a way it was part of our
equipment or rather part of our crew
it is the frozen corpse of a man this
corpse is now slowly revolving about
the moon with its arms by its sides stiff
and rigid as a log of wood

  mr dobbs seemed to be quite inter-
ested at this explanation he passed
his cigar case to the inventor and to his

competitor and leaning back in his chair
lit one of the corona coronas tell
us about it he said to dr alison

  i will replied the inventor but
i must first pledge you to silence in
the first place it would needlessly alarm
travelers to the moon and in the sec-
ond place it would be shocking to the
relatives of this man provided any ever
turn up

  mr dobbs and mr barry agreed to
this and dr allison began

  you are aware he said that my
invention was developed on a very small
scale in the laboratory after i became
certain of its success i looked about for
some area where i could try out a ship
sufficiently large to house me and the
necessary machinery to be free from
cranks and curiosity seekers i followed
the example of the wright brothers and
selected the long sandy bar bounding
pamlico sound off the coast of north
carolina i picked out a deserted spot
about  miles south of kitty hawk
where the wrights conducted their
epochal experiments with their aeroplane

  i needed a companion and helper and
i entered into correspondence with cap-
tain dick lawrence of the united states
navy air forces for i knew him to be
a daring and intelligent young man he
agreed to come with me and he proved
to be invaluable in drawing up the
plans for he was a skillful draughtsman
the necessary materials were ordered
with directions to ship them to the
nearest town on the mainland dick
and i then went over on the island
and with the help of two or three car-
penters from the mainland we put up a
cabin and a workshop

  while we awaited the arrival of our
material dick and i tramped about the
island our section of it appeared to
be uninhabited and was covered with
breast high bushes and dwarf trees it
was low flat and sandy and in no place


amazing stories

was over fifty feet above sea level this
long sand bar has some name upon the
map but dick and i while gazing one
night upon the star cluster known as
the pleiades decided to christen the
island merope after the lost pleiad
who concealed herself for shame for
having loved a mortal and our ship was
to be called alcyone after another
pleiad

  on one of these tramps about the
island we came upon a rude cabin and
as the day was cold with a drizzling rain
falling we knocked on the door hoping
for shelter a young man came to the
door and at first seemed to be unwilling
to let us in he needed a haircut badly
was unshaven and negligent in ap-
pearance and looked like a tramp we
finally convinced him that we meant him
no harm and he let us in and we sat
down near the open fireplace we
talked with the young man for a few
minutes and gaining confidence he told
us of innumerable reverses he had suf-
fered on the mainland and which ap-
peared to have embittered his spirit he
had fled to this island and was now liv-
ing as a recluse i saw that there was
little danger of him communicating our
plans to any one and as we needed help

i	asked him to aid us in the construction
of the alcyone to this he agreed and
we left after telling him when we ex-
pected the material to arrive

  when the steel came dick walked
dver to the cabin and got the young
man and together we went to the main-
land and had the material transported
to our workshop on the sand bar con-
struction was begun immediately the
plans called for an interior diameter of
 feet with two feet of mineral wool
and vacuum insulation thus making a
huge steel globe  feet in diameter
the steel hull was made of segments
welded together and the interior was
bisected with a steel flooring under

which were the generators and their
motors on opposite sides of this
floor were the two locks for communica-
tion with outdoors they were simply
heavily insulated steel cylinders about
 inches high and six feet long and
were provided with an airtight and in-
sulated door with a glass porthole in its
center the circular door in the hull
could be opened by means of mechanism
in the cabin

  thus our cabin was a circular domed
affair with a steel cylinder on the floor
on each side and a small table in the
center there were six observation
ports provided and these could be con-
nected with these tubes heavily coated
with lampblack inside which brought a
reflection of the exterior world to mir-
rors on the table they were about
the size of a small stovepipe and made
the cabin look something like a basement
furnace with the hot air pipes extending
in different directions

tt required about three weeks to
construct the ship and then we
made several trial trips sometimes as-
cending as high as  miles above the
surface of the earth the machinery
functioned perfectly but we found that
unless the alcyone was heavily ballasted
with mercury she was liable to turn
completely over standing us on our
heads or in other awkward positions
in our trial trips we always towed the
ship well out to sea for when we came
down the earth had moved to the east-
ward on two occasions we remained
in the air at a height of  miles and
let the earth make one complete revo-
lution under us in a months time we
felt quite competent to navigate the
alcyone in space and looked forward
to a voyage to the moon

  on several occasions we took along
the sad young man but he used to get
on my nerves with his continual wailing
buried in space



about his misfortunes his people had
lost all their money and had neglected
to provide him with a career his best
friends had deserted him in his adversity
and even his sweetheart had abandoned
him for another man so when the time
came for us to start to the moon we
sent hopeless as dick called him back
to his cabin but he must have overheard
our plans as you will see

e had applied to a large eastern
university for certain data nota-
bly an estimate of the time required to
make the trip using the earths centri-
fugal force and the moons attraction
for propulsion and allowing for the
slackening of speed as the ship neared
the surface of the moon according to
the figures received it would take us

	days and  hours to make the voy-
age ab to the existence of an atmos-
phere on the moon and its temperature
we could get nothing definite they
varied with the astronomers

  with the aid of the forlorn youth
we provisioned the alcyone for sixty
days we deposited our wills and the
plans of the ship with a banking institu-
tion with instructions to open them at
the end of sixty days at the hour
recommended by the university we
crawled through one of the locks into
the cabin of the ship after making
sure that everything was secure i
started the motors and forty seconds
later the alcyone left the surface of
the earth

  you will understand that we could
not ascend to the moon directly over
our heads but must start at a time when
that body was not over a third way
around on its circuit so that in a little
over nine days we would be nearing its
sphere of attraction and so up we
went faster and faster our speed accel-
erating every minute although our mo-
tion could not be detected within the

cabin save by watching the diminishing
disc of the earth by midnight that
planet had become a great cloudy circle
below us and away to our right was the
bright moon rushing along at the rate
of  miles a minute to meet us at the
celestial try sting place

  up there is neither morning nor
noon but always night the sky is per-
fectly black and the stars shine steadily
like colored jewels the sun is an elec-
tric blue in color and its polar brushes
are plainly visible it is a fearful ob-
ject to look upon and it would blind you
to gaze at it without using smoked
glass or some such device the earth
becomes a shield of rose and pearl and
gold and is very beautiful to see the
markings of the moon become more
plain for a third of the journey she is
bathed in a cold luminous fire and looks
not unlike a great mottled ball of crystal

  all these things we could see on the
mirrors before us on the tabl dick
and i sat there for the balance of the
night enjoying the spectacle thus far
from freezing with the cold of space
we found the temperature in the cabin
to be warm even hot our vacuum in-
sulation had seen to that i finally per-
suaded dick to lie down on a pallet and
take a nap we were now about ocx
miles from the earth and our speed may
have been that of the rotation of the
globe at merope island which is about
 miles a minute

   i was sitting there at the table look-
ing at a reflection of the moon in one
of the mirrors when i heard a most
unusual noise i think my hair stood
on end for my nerves were in the high-
est possible state of tension it sounded
like a deep groan and appeared to come
from under the floor-from somewhere
in the hold i awoke dick and we de-
scended to the engine room the motors
and generators were humming smooth-
ly and everything seemed to be secure


amazing stories

i was about to give up the search when
dick directed his torch down on the
floor grating and saw some dark ob-
ject underneath we lifted up a sec-
tion of the grating and there lay the
body of a man with his face down-
ward we carried him up the narrow
stairs into the cabin and laid him on
the floor we now saw who it was
and guessed how he came to be under
the engine room gratings of the al-
cyone

tt was no other than the sad young

 j- man whom dick had christened
hopeless he had overhead one of us
mention the hour of departure and un-
observed had come back from his cabin
and hid himself below the engine-room
floor there he had become saturated
with the fumes of acid and the poison-
ous gases of the exhaust some of which
managed to leak from the motor cylin-
ders incidentally we used picric add
in the fuel compound we revived him
with a dose of aromatic spirits of am-
monia and he talked lucidly for a while
and we fully expected his speedy re-
covery he was even beginning to wail
over his troubles again and said that he
had stowed away on the alcyone with
the idea that he was committing a kind
of romantic suicide but he failed to
recover

 we made a pallet for him on the
floor near the table and there he lay
hour after hour moaning and tossing
with the alcyone shooting through
space at the rate of  miles an hour all
he could stand on his stomach was a
little diluted milk of the canned variety
he had been poisoned by picric acid and
we had no antidote after a few hours
he grew calmer and went to sleep in
this manner three and one half days
went by and we were at the beginning
of the sixth day out from the earth he
then began to grow restless and to com-

plain in his old vein or rancor i final-
ly lost patience with him and said

   listen hopeless it is you who
have forgotten the world and your
very humble place it the world has
not forgotten you

  i was soon sorry that i said this for
about five minutes later hopeless with
his face yellowed with picric acid turned
over on his side and died

  we were now faced with a problem
what were we to do with the body of
the unfortunate man the cabin was
suffocatingly hot but wte did not dare let
in any of the cold of outer space the
descent to the earth would take far
longer than the time it had taken to
gain our present position we had no
ice and no cooling system of any kind
and it was very evident that we must
do something before long

  while dick and i sought for a so-
lution to this problem another day went
by with the beautiful disc of the earth
shrinking and the moons apparent diam-
eter gaining in size it now had lost all
of its silvery lustre and appeared like
a huge ball of pitted clay floating si-
lently in the heavens

  poor hopeless lay on the floor of
the cabin with a sheet thrown over him
we had taken a few pitiful trinkets
from his pockets and placed them upon
the table they included a rusty key-
ring with one key attached half of a
lead pencil a cheap and broken pocket
knife a pocket book containing a photo-
graph of a girl which we judged to be
that of his former sweetheart and a
few coins but what should we do
with his body

  dick and i discussed this over and
over again if we did take him to the
moon with us there was no guarantee
that we could leave him there we might
find temperatures of boiling water or
worse dick suggested that we put the
body in one of the locks and push it
buried in space



out into space the poor fellow would
fall a hundred thousand miles and more
until he struck the upper layers of the
earths atmosphere then there would
be a flash of fire and some one on earth
might note a flaming meteor as hopeless
ended in a blaze of glory the idea
shocked me and i cast about for a bet-
ter plan

  a careful measurement of the ap-
parent diameters of the earth and the
moon showed me that we were now
nearing the periphery of the earths at-
traction and which lies  miles
from the earth and  miles from
the moon using mean distance as a
basis of calculation a half hour be-
fore we reached this no mans land of
the two bodies we placed the corpse of
the young recluse in the lock and closed
the inner door at the required time
i opened the door in the hull an inch or
so fearful of the terrible cold of inter-
stellar space nothing happened and i
opened it a fraction of an inch more and
so on until it was fully drawn back
the insulation in the cabin door of the
lock proved magnificent some frost
formed upon this door and on the thick
glass porthole through which we stared
at the body inside resting upon our
hands and knees the outer door be-

ing fully open dick stopped and re-
versed the engines of the alcyone and
the body slid gently out into space and
began its eternal journey about the
moon

  the inventor paused and mr barry
asked a question

  why should it not have fallen di-
rectly to the surface of the moon
because we were approaching the
moon at a tangent and the centrifugal
force given to the body by the al-
cyone was greater than the moons at-
traction which here was negligible it
therefore became a satellite of the moon
and will revolve about that globe until
the end of time

  the inventor picked up his hat and
arose to go you will understand be
said to his audience that it would be
inadvisable to make my explanation
public gentlemen i must be going
good by and good luck called
dobbs after the retreating form of the
columbus of space well barry if
that poor boy has any relatives on earth
they will never learn of his grave from
me

  one of the few cases remarked
mr barry as he picked up his paper
where the truth would do no good and
very likely much harm

the end

bob olsen and joe skidmore are to be
noted as contributing to our november issue

  the first writer with nokken of norway a
thrilling story of norwegian tradition with the
exact atrfiosphere of that country and mr skidmore
gives one of the best of his recent productions

in the realm of books

conducted by g a brandt

seven famous novels

-the time machine the island of dr
  moreau the invisible man the war
  of the worlds the first men in the
  moon the food of the gods in the
  days of the comet by h g wells pub-
  lished by alfred knopf  west th st
  new york

  why when the sleeper wakes which is
in my opinion the fifth best of wells sociological
fantasies was left out of this collection is
not quite clear perhaps they did not know
about it in th street but anyhow the publish-
ing of a wells omnibus is a very creditable
effort on the part of the publisher but whether
it will be so very profitable is a question which
i cannot answer at any rate i believe it will
be a very welcome addition to the libraries of
those people who buy shakespeare maupas-
sant etc in one volume

  wells stories are so well known to our
readers that to go into their various contents
would be equal to taking along to munich a
case of near-beer at the time when science
fiction became definitely recognized as a new-
type of literature the more or less sociological
novels of wells were considered classics but
since then they have been surpassed by very
many scientifically up-to-date and much less
verbose writers

   the price of the book is 

intrigue on the upper level by thomas
  temple hoyne published by reilly  lee
  chicago  pages 

   this is a very clever and entertaining book
notwithstanding the fact that it belongs to the
utopia group

  the scene of this book is chicago in the
year  the educated proletariat is just
waking up from its slumbers on the beach our
hero jimmy and his friend dr edgerton watch
a young lady emerge through a heavily guarded
doorway of the upper level and descend a
narrow stairway leading to the beach the
young lady glistens with diamonds and is
promptly attacked and would have been robbed
of her jewels if our heroes had not intervened
by beating down her assailants the upper
level guards also take a hand in the fight and
in the mix-up jimmy and the doctor are pushed
through the guarded entrance and are now in
the forbidden realm of the upper level the
girl is vivian daughter of the all powerful
master george ransler ransler is supreme

master of every commercial enterprise banks
factories etc in other words he is in absolute
control of ail and every commercial activity in
chicago known as the system he is sur-
rounded with hundreds of bodyguards and
countless safety devices and is practically in-
accessible his household is like a large
fortress filled with secretaries menials bravos
gun men to you etc with the complete
downfall of the capitalistic system the then
already very powerful gangsters took hold of
things and the vicious capitalists were super-
seded by them in other words gangsters rule
instead of banksters the dear stupid populace
did not mind the change much as long as they
had baseball and prizefights and were allowed
to vote and could celebrate the national holi-
days listen to the sacred blah-blah of profes-
sional politicians and were allowed to lose
their money on the stock exchange most of
the people were almost always out of work
and were kept alive by a sort of dole and free
rent of course the people of the lower level
were seething with ideas of revolt but lacked
leaders

  these are very interesting chapters describing
with painful accuracy the road the world is
traveling on

  our heroes finally meet the master and are
granted permission to visit the great under-
ground laboratories and here we have very
interesting sidelights on the trend of modem
manufacturing

  it seems that the system maintained one
large laboratory solely for the purpose of per-
fecting the production of worthless and shoddy
merchandise the underlying idea being that
the sooner a certain article became useless the
sooner it had to be replaced

  the love element also enters the story
vivian a drug addict falls in love with jimmy
but is repulsed because jimmy is in love with
miriam of the lower level

  miriam is the leader of a revolutionary corps
of girls vivian has miriam kidnapped this
kidnapping leads to open revolt in the ensuing
chaos vivian kills her own father the mas-
ter and the discovery of the production of
synthetic gold becoming public property the
vicious gangster system crashes

  the far seeing genius of george ransler
created a sort of island kingdom called new
city founded on strictly humanitarian and
utopian lines and ideas and here under the
leadership of jimmy a new civilization arises

  intrigue on the upper level is a thought-
provoking and disturbing book well worth
reading

  being a new reader of the magazine may i
add my criticism in discussions it is very
difficult to obtain copies here but those i have
read have been very interesting the bridge
of light i considered the best in my small se-
lection and it is not possible for me to follow
the discussions on others but i was very much
amused by r mcnaims criticism in the june
 copy his commencement gives a good
idea of his character he admits starting to
write five letters surely weak on his part
he should try to write a story himself and
realize the knowledge required for instance
he says the hero and villain and the fair young
thing are dumped upon mars or venus surely
the fair young thing has as much right in
amazing stosies as in any other magazine i
am no scientist but the laws of life include the
necessity then he goes on to criticize the
illustrations has he not learned that a little
give and a little take is necessary  i suggest
that he wait until in the mood to read the
magazine so much happens to an otherwise
good story if the reader has just had a differ-
ence of opinion

editor amazing stories

   i have been a constant reader of amazing
stories for more than five years ever since i
lived in new orleans but i am afraid i will
not remain loyal to you if you continue print-
ing such stuff as measuring a meridian by
jules verne why i read that story when i
was ten years old i realize it costs you less
to print one of poes or vernes works than to
have dr keller write a story for you but i
dont give a hang if you raise the price of the
iag to fifty cents as long as it has good up-to-
date stories by williamson whose stone
from the green star we still remember bob
olsen dr breuer neil r jones more of
whose professor jameson stories we still
await francis flagg of ardathis stories

name harl vincent a pioneer science-fiction
author edmond hamilton who has done
most of his best work for another magazine

but not least the best science fiction author in

  now here is a plea i am sure most of the
readers will agree to please avoid anything
weird or supernatural in our mag if we
wanted to read that topic we would buy weird
magazines such stories as ancients of
easter island and the last earl especially
this last one are not fit to appear in amazing
stories

   i would like to correspond with any science
fiction fan especially a keller fan from far
off australia any letter from the states will
be gladly answered

  now i want to say a few words for those
mighty warriors of the pen whose letters never
fail in discussions i am referring to forrest
j ackerman of frisco milton kaletsky neel
marietta of philly jack darrow of chi and
fred anger of berkeley the editor never
seems to notice the persistence of thse writ-
ing nuts but it is a good idea that of writing
often stating your likes and dislikes i have
yet to find ackerman missing in two successive
issues of any science fiction magazine

   i have quite a collection of science fiction
magazines one hundred and eighteen to be
exact and i would like any fan living in or
around mexico city to communicate with me
and possibly do some trading

  recently i saw a very good idea in discus-
sions someone suggested that you should
print a picture and biography of a favorite
author each month this has already been
done by the science fiction digest now fan-
tasy magazine which by the way is getting
too weird for real science fiction fans

   regarding size paper etc everything is all
right but dont keep changing everything every
month

  about the illustrations morey is ok for
the inside illustrations but let sigmond con-
tinue the covers

  the story measuring a meridian by
jules verne-does not deserve to be called
such stuff if you read it attentively and

hearted appreciation from his readers you
are not the only one who objected to the last
earl but we do not feel as you do about the
story the ancients of easter island you
will find preceding your letter a very good
epistle from australia and we think that the
writer might prove to be a very interesting
correspondent for you vve feel that we have
no room for an adequate biography for any of
our authors our own disposition being to ex-
pand the discussions-editor

a compliment for moreyi cover

 editor amazing stories 

   this is my second attempt to get into the
 discussions department-and i hope i break
 the ice this time as i have a few vital things
 to say about amazing stories

   before me is the may  issue and the
 first thing that strikes me is the magnificent
 cover design by morey why doesnt he
 always do such outstanding work his covers
 are usually good but woe to the interior illus-
 trations these appear to have been done in
 some great hurry thus he has only had time
 to scribble take for instance the picture on
 page  and see the mass of scribbled lines and
 circles that try to represent space-ships hor-
 rible looking things to say the least now
 such a good magazine as amazing should have
 good drawings inside as well as on the cover-
 why isnt this so morey-when he likes-can
 do ultra-good work but please command him to
 hoist his socks up a bit

  then i come to dr sloanes chat this
 is always good no matter what the subject is
 i dont think anything further can be said
 about that

   the size of the mag is another question
 so many readers wish it was back to the large
 size i do too for it made it stand out above
 all others and dominate the news-stands this
 small shape is quite handy ill admit but when
 i carried the larger ones i felt a sense of hav-
 ing something better than just a mere maga-
 zine under my arm it definitely is a different
 magazine therefore it should be made to appear
 different from every angle still i suppose its
 no good me wailing about that   

   now for the contents

  who wants to read about jules verne i
 ask you why put  into a  mag
 havent you enough modern authors that can
 dish out stuff to modern people-and therefore
 must fall back on ancients most of wells
 and verne books are printed separately and
 have been read long ago may i discreetly
 murmur that they be left out of all further
 issues

  the ultra-gamma wave this was a
 swell story it had this that these and those

  the white dwarf here we deal with
 great nay titanic forces we move worlds
 we see venerians    millions die    the sun
 shrinks    and the earth grows cold all
 that and some more is crushed into a small
 yarn incidentally spoiling it and making it ap-

 pear crushed great pityl the story would
 have looked good if it had been spread out x

bit

dr grimshaws sanitarium very good

  the lost city i looked forward to the
next instalment of this humdinger terror
out of space i wish i hadnt missed a couple
of parts of this yarn i like it

  a dream so we have a little poetry i
suppose this is to sooth our nerves after read-
ing about some awful and bloody fight with
the moon-men well we dont want our nerves
soothed thanks and i think the space given to
poetry could be used up either by some scien-
tific data or a photograph howzat

   somebody once said they didnt like the love
in science stories now can you imagine for
one single moment a series of long stories deal-
ing with machine men war and space-trips
without a woman coming in somewhere its
only natural that a woman should appear-it
helps the story to flow along with more ease
besides adding that little something that
makes more of a man out of the hero stories
without women seem to look like a series
of black-and-white pictures you want a little
color  and yet it mustnt be over-done-
just little touches here and there to whet the
appetite so to speak

  the discussions column is the first thing i
read it almost ks good as a story-and i
see that a lot of folk ask other folk to write to
them may i add my cry to this id very
much like to get the feminine slant on all this
asteroid stuff if anybody does write to me
i shall answer them i have here a small club
where i go to discuss interplanetary ideas and
suggestions youd be surprised how far weve
delved into this we always welcome new
correspondent s

the way i read a yam politics the other

imply far more than dry seriousness and praise
where our efforts meet with reprehension de-
served or undeserved we often think the let-
ter is excellent a broad view of things goes
to make all kinds of criticism acceptable-thf
unfavorable will perhaps season the rest if
nothing but laudatory letters were published in

the truth will make a good story

editor amazing stories

   i like your magazine because there is a cer-
tain amount of icience in the stories i think
you would make more sales and please your
present customers more by publishing a story
of some laboratory work that the scientists of
to-day are working on such as making heavy
water or the bombardment of the atom
it would be more preferred that these stories
be true and written by one who knows about
the work you may ediine back at me by saying
you cant get an interesting story from any-
thing like that but i know a good many of
the readers will say that the truth will make
a good story

  laboratory experimentation correctly de-
scribed hardly seems to lend itself to science
fiction an attempt to carry out what you
suggest would lead to stories that might be
termed dry we are glad however to publish
your letter and hope that it will give a good
hint to some of our authors but remember that
we are publishers of science fiction rather than
of science truth-editor

cover from the praise which he is receiving
from our readers certainly in life ever-

  it is a club for boys up to the age f 
nineteen years

  the dues are c a month they are used to
buy more magazines and stf books

  anyone wishing to join for one months trial

magazines which are given to the clubs files

  when your membership expires and you do
not wish to re-join we send your two stf

opinion of your magazine

  the best stories lately were triplanetary
publish more like it the lost city what a
story beam transmission and subjuga-
ing the earth have more like them

  i will not say anything about my dislikes as
no doubt other readers think those stories ex-
cellent and i do not wish to be arguing by

  we have always been glad to publish no-
tices about science fiction clubs we have a

an excellent letter of praise and criticism

editor amazing stories

  yes beyond a doubt the superb dr keller is
at his best in the current serial life everlast-
ing keller has always been in my estima-
tion one of the top-notchers and so does he
continue to be as is proved by life everlast-
ing and although the narrative is written
around an old rehashed theme it nevertheless
will stand out among the dozen best  because
of the unexcelled way in which it is written

  and the same may be said of each of the
others in the july issue they are the cream
of the crop

  no doubt ye ed is tired yea very weary of
ye readers constant scolding upon this point or
that point suggesting and urging that this be
done or that be done and yet that is the only
means by which the governing body readers
can rule the magazine so now that youve
received in the former paragraphs the posies
you mast receive the custard pies

first and always first we want large
size did you get that large size

second dont improve the stories it cant be
done no-im not crazy third get wes-
so back and last get us out a quarterly
quarterly and of course keep a reprint
quarterly amen

  more poises-

  well do we remember charles cloukeys mas-
terpiece the swordsman of sarvon and
now tis time for another of the great clou-
keys productions lets have it soon

  and a final suggestion about reprints use
those stories printed in the first four or five
years and discontinue the works of poe and
verne in the monthly now the reprints in
the quarterly are excellent re
bartons island et cetera we might sug-
gest the green splotches or any of those
numerous balmer  mcharg stf-detective
stories re the hammering man the
eleventh hour etc for the monthly sta-
tion x would make good material as would
a columbus of space

  at least choose those stories from back issues
that are particularly hard to get so that those
who have not read them can-
and one more suggestion please morey
should work a little more color variety into his
covers for instance his june and july covers
were in nearly the same colors as were the
march and april he should have an entirely
different color for succeeding issues use a
green cover or a purple one merely for va-
riety

  and i remain a friend while the small size
prevails and a sincere devotee when the great
day comes when good old a s is one again

as we go over these letters for the discussions
it seems that each one has a better word for

dr keller than the last we have always felt
that there is a peculiar touch about dr kellers
work that makes it quite distinct from that of
other authors his technical knowledge makes
him a peculiarly authorative writer on such
topics as those embodied in life everlasting
we are not tired of being scolded- we have
had long practise at standing the gaff the
question of size is a perplexing one many
prefer the library size as it now is which
brings it in line with the highest grade maga-
zines that are published a change in size
should be done at the beginning of a volume
so we have a good many months to think about
it before doing anything the last quarterlies
have pleased you and we are glad of that be-
cause it was really an experiment using noth-
ing but reprints-editor

the question of large size er small size

             amazing stories
editor amazing stories

  it was with the greatest pleasure that i
picked up the july edition of our truly fine
magazine and it was with the greatest sorrow
that i laid it down again having read the issue
from cover to cover which left no more for
these eager eyes to read

  the editorials are scientific gems which are
worth the price of the magazine alone i have
noticed from time to time how some critic has
attempted to find flaws in the excellent science
contained in the editorial and every time it
was the critic who was wrong and not the
editor the editorials contain facts repeated
in almost every scientific text but they are
never presented elsewhere in such a pleasing
interesting manner no subterfuges are used
which will lead the reader through dubious
passages of thought but they are written in a
clear concise and understandable language i
believe i am speaking the opinions of most of
the readers when i make such a statement

  one thing mr editor which just pierces my
heart is to go in a new stand have to pick up
my beloved friend from a mess of cheap fic-
tion just because of the sizes being alike i
am one of them queer types of fellows who
likes to revel in tradition i was raised on a
large size a s which always used to be
among the other dignified scientific magazines
therefore it is ejujte a step dowp for me to
have one of my best friends descend among the
common trash i know that the contents are
the same and all of that but how much better
would my pride feel if it were its former large
self some how or other i cannot get used tc
a s being anything but an aristocratic large
size magazine sometimes i feel that our dear
editor has feelings much akin to those i have
expressed in regard to tradition evcti if they
are impractical at times and he also would
like to see the large size back at least he
hasnt made any false statements such as that
the readers demanded the small size as others
have done in a similar circumstance i challenge

i obtain one my only regret is that when i
read about the wonderful offers made by your

available over here i am extremely interested
in all science fiction magazines and not one of

lish this letter so that the rest of your readers
will know that at least one irishman or rather
boy i am eighteen wishes you the best of
luck and prosperity

  you will notice that i am not criticizing
any of the stories and the reason is that i dont
know enough science although i am learning

  gravity is not a phase of electricity-

        it attracts but cannot repel
editor amazing stories

  in the discussions column of the may issue
h j marks asks why cannot a ship be
built to discharge a positive current at the earth
thus reversing gravitys action on the theory
that like poles repel and that we regard gravi-
tation as a potential current of negative elec-
tricity attracting matter to earth

  he has evidently completely forgotten what
gravity is i quote from memory it is that

force which acts so that every atom in every
body attracts every atom in its own and in
every other body with a force which varies
inversely with the square of the distance be-
tween the centers

  consequently were the force to be reversed
every atom in every body would repel every
atom etc and every thing would fly apart

  therefore his theory is entirely incorrect
consult any physics book

  incidentally the may issue was well written
in spite of too many serial stories the cover
was good

  the point involved in this letter which is
in answer to a previous letter in the discus-
sions columns is complete in itself and it needs
no comment a good answer to the original
correspondent might be for him to try to build
a mode of the ship he describes no matter
how small-editor

a canadian letter about rays principally

editor amazing stories 

  thanks for getting your magazine back into
canada again after being without it for a
couple of years because of the duties you can
imagine how i felt when it made its reappear-
ance on the newsstands a few months ago

  i must compliment you on the stand you have
maintained in most of your stories although
only a high school student i am greatly inter-
ested in science of every kind my friends
laugh at me for reading that silly magazine
but ill guarantee that i get more good out of
one issue of a s than they get from all their
popular magazines in a year

  far be it from me to throw bricks at your
authors or make unnecessary complaints but i
would like to see the science in the stories as
accurate as possible

  in regard to these inaccuracies of scientific
fact which i am glad are not very frequent
there is one that i have noticed so often that i
have decided to mention it- it is this matter of
rays destructive and otherwise that has become
se popular with your authors to make this
matter clear will require some explanation

  the known range of the electro-magnetic
spectrum is from a frequency of about x
for alternating current to about xs for cos-
mic rays taking these electro-magnetic waves
by ascending frequencies we have

type of wave	vibrations per second

 radium x    x 

cosmic rays x    -

  now here is what i am getting at in this
entire electro-magnetic spectrum as known
there are only two unexplored bands one below
the infra-red and the other above the ultra-
violet although some of the other bands of
frequencies have not been explored as much as
possible at least we have a fairly good knowl-
edge of their effect on various substances the
relatively narrow band of visible waves espe-
cially have been thoroughly examined due to
the ease of manipulation and observation yet
there is no part of the spectrum in this region
that could be used as a weapon of defence or
offence except for the fact that it makes ob-
jects visible in which case it has some de-
fensible value it is true that an intense beam
of white light will explode certain substances
such as a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen
gases yet it has no detrimental effect on human
beings or on any of the materials used for struc-
tural purposes consequently if rays that are
destructive are ever discovered they will cer-
tainly not be of a visible frequency there is
a possibility of course that such a ray would
affect particles in the air so as to render them
visible but still such a ray would be invisible
in itself

  a powerful ray of infra-red light would pos-
sibly cause destructive effects by heating and
would probably make dust in the air visible by
heating it to incandescence in this case the
ray would be visible due to the heated dust par-
ticles all along its path

   in such cases where the rays are invisible it
would be advantageous to project a beam of vis-
ible light along with it for purposes of aiming
just as tracer bullets are used with machine-
irun ammunition to make the line of fire visible
however even visible light can only be seen
as a beam when there are enough particles of
dust fog or smoke present to reflect and refract
some of the light in such a direction as to strike
the eye of the observer if the air were per-
fectly free from such particles even this method
would not render the path of the ray visible

  in a vacuum such as that of interstellar
space there would be no method of rendering
the path of a ray visible at an angle from the
line of projection even a beam of white light
would be invisible unless the observer were
directly in its path looking at the projector
to make it visible as a beam would require
thousands of reflecting particles to the cubic
foot so many in fact that sunlight would never
be able to penetrate  miles of it to
reach the earth it would be entirely dispersed
long before that yet in hundreds of your
stories we read of flashing beams of light of
every color used by battling ships in space

  here is an extract from your recent story
tri planetary a full two-thirds of rogers
force was caught in that raging incandescent
beam and in space at that yet mr smith is
a university graduate and should have a good

knowledge of physics however the talk about
defensive screens at least the visible ones is
open for discussion when waves of two differ-
ent frequencies combine they might possibly
do so in such a way as to produce what might
be called a beat-note or a common frequency
that would lie within the visible part of the
spectrum it is in this way that two musical
notes of different frequencies will combine ami
produce a beat note of an entirely different fre-
quency but even this visible wave if it were
produced would be invisible unless the com-
bined waves were reflected in some way to the
eyes of the observer and if they were at all
destructive that would hardly be desirable

  in another place where the super-ship of
triplanetary is battling the nevian space ship
we read of spitting high-tension sparks agrain
in space which is probably a more perfect
vacuum than we can at present obtain in even
our best equipped laboratories surely every-
one knows that high-tension sparks cannot leap
through a vacuum in modern vacuum tubes
after a certain degree of exhaustion has been
obtained sparks cease to leap across even in
x-ray tubes where a ccrtain amount of residual
gas is always present actual sparks cannot be
produced no matter how powerful the coils arc
true there is a discharge the x-rays them-
selves but these are far different from the
sparks of a high-tension current such sparks
cease long before the degree of vacuity that is
present in x-ray tubes has been reached

  perhaps dr smith remembered this yet de-
liberately made the mistake for the sake of the
story if so i feel that he should have men-
tioned this in a footnote and have given the
true facts for those who wished them if the
reader does not care for the technical explana-
tions let him go on with the story and not
read the footnotes this is a method that used
to be applied with success in some of the other
science-fiction magazines

  personally i enjoy the story greatly and i
admit that it would have lost a good deal of
interest if the flashing beams and flaring
screens had been absent

  good luck to your magazine and here hop-
ing that the canadian edition will become a
permanent fixture

  rays are used in stories about space-war
because it is hard to see how a story could be
vivid without some such element and we think
that our authors are justified in using- them
you undoubtedly have noticed that some of our
correspondents are almost irritated at the editor
of this magazine expressing his disbelief of
man getting to the moon this makes us feel
that we will have to be a little generous with
rays and not object to our authors making a
very picturesque in space where rays are made
the fighting elements and are opposed by in-
visible screens--edito

 ner of the maryland hunt

have you tried this enjoyable
way of heightening energy

rex beach famous sports
man says when ive landed
a bi game fish i light a camel
and feel as good as new

camels costlier tobaccos
never get on your nerves

mrs charles daly house-
wife says camels pick up my
energy  and have a delicate
flavor that a woman likes

 mr crawford burton the famous american steeple-
 chase rider says

   whether im tired from riding a hard race or from
 the pressure and tension of a crowded business day i
 feel refreshed and restored just as soon as i get a chance
 to smoke a camel so im a pretty incessant smoker not
 only because camels give me a lift in energy but be-
 cause they taste so good and never yet have camels
 upset my nerves

   you have heard the experience of others science tells
 us that camels energizing effect has been fully con-
 firmed you can smoke as many as you like for camels
 are made from finer and more expensive tobac-
 cos they never taste flatnever get on your nerves
