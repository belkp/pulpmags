lows the illustration conscientiously

the voice from the inner world byf
a hyatt verrill this story has won second honor-dl

gruesome narrative	

the lost continent by cecil b whitem
third honorable mention story some thoughts ori

noted instructor lecturer and
author formerly treasurer ameri-
can chemical society and a practical
chemist with many well known
achievements to his credit not
only has dr sloane taught chemis-
try for years but he was for many
years engaged in commercial
chemistry work

good chemists command high salaries

and you can make yourself
independent for life by un-
earthing one of chemistrys
yet undiscovered secrets

 do you remember how the tales of pirate gold used to fire
 your imagination and make you want to sail the uncharted
 seas in search of treasure and adventure and then you
 would regret that such things were no longer done but that
 is a mistake they are done-today and everyday-not on
 desert islands but in the chemical laboratories throughout
 your own country quietly systematically the chemist works
 his work is difficult but more adventurous than the blood-
 curdling deeds of the spanish main instead of meeting an
 early and violent death on some forgotten shore he gathers
 wealth and honor through his invaluable contributions to hu-
 manity alfred nobel the swedish chemist who invented
 dynamite made so many millions that the income alone from
 his bequests provides five  prizes every year for the
 advancement of science and peace c m hall the chemist
 who discovered how to manufacture aluminum made millions
 through this discovery f g cottrell who devised a valu-
 able process for recovering the waste from flue gases james
 gayley who showed how to save enormous losses in steel
 manufacture l h baekeland who invented bakelite-these
 are only a few of the men to whom fortunes have come
 through their chemical achievements

now is the time to
study chemistry

  not only are there boundless opportunities for amassing
  wealth in chemistry but the profession affords congenial
  employment at good salaries io hundreds of thousands who
  merely follow out its present applications these appli-

  oroanprt s	filled with thrilling and delightful experimentation with the alluring f

  prospect or a discovery that may spell fortune always at hand to spur your enthusiasm

 what some of our

  i have not written since i received the big
  set i can still say that it far exceeded my
  anticipations since i have been studying with
  your school i have been appointed chemist for
  the scranton coal co testing all the coal and
  ash by proximate analysis the lessons are
  helping me wonderfully and the interesting
  way in which they are written makes me wait
  patiently for each jesson-morlais couz

  i wish to express my appreciation of your
  prompt reply to my letter and to the recom-
  mendation to the general electric co i in-
  tend to start the student engineering course at
  the works this is somewhat along electrical
  lines but the fact that i had a recommenda-
  tion from a tellable school no doubt had con-
  siderable influence in helping me to secure the
  job-h van benthuysen

  so far ive been more than pleased with
  your course and am still doing nicely i hope
  to be your honor graduate this year-j m
  norkus jr

  i find your course excellent and your instruc-
  tion truthfully the clearest and best assem-
  bled i have ever taken and yours is the fifth
  one ive studied-james j kelly

  from the time i was having chemistry it
  has never been thus explained to me as it is
  now i am recommending you highly to my
  friends and urging them to become members
  of such an organization-charles ben-
  jamin

  i shall always recommend your school to my
  friends and let them know how simple your les-
  sons are-c j amdahl

  i am more than pleased you dig right in
  from the start i am going to get somewhere
  with this course i am so glad that i found
  you-a a cameron

mr hugo gernsback speaks every monday at  p m from wrny on various scientific and radio subjects

 finally announcing the prize winners in the 
 prize contest an interesting chapter in the young
 life of amazing stories has been brought to
 a successful close to those of our readers who
 have not seen or heard about this prize contest
 let us briefly state that on our december 
  cover a picture was shown around which a story

 of not more than  words was to be written
 the picture was purely fanciful and you will find it
 reproduced herewith not only was it highly fanciful but fan-
 tastic as well and our readers were asked to base upon it a
 suitable story that would be not only plausible but possible
 the story was to be of the scientifiction type and was to con-
 tain correct scientific facts to make it appear plausible and
 within the realm of present-day
 knowledge of science

  the contest -may be said to
 have been a very successful one

 some   stories were actually
 f received by the editors and our
 readers may rest assured that it
 feas not a simple matter to come
 to a decision because many
 worthwhile stories were submit-
  ted there were to be three
 prizes totaling  as follows

 first prize  second prize

   third prize  the
 prize winning stories weri

    first prize the visi talflqf 
 by cyril g wates -ldua
  ave edmonton alta canada

    second prize the electronic
 wall by geo r fox three
 oaks michigan

    third prize the fate of the
 poseidonia by mrs f c har-
 ris  lincoln avenue lake-
 wood ohio

   the three stories mentioned
 above are printed complete in
 this issue while four further
 ones which were awarded hon-
 orable mention will be published
 in future issues the four stor-
 ies which were awarded honor-
 able mention were the following i
 first honorable mention-

 the ether ship of oltor by
 s maxwell coder  paschall
 ave philadelphia pa

  second honorable mention-the voice from the inner
world by a hyatt verrill box  station w new york
city

  third honorable mention-the lost continent by cecil b
white  crescent road foul bay victoria b c
canada

  fourth honorable mention-the gravitomobile by d b
mcrae  e street san bernardino california

  you might think that seven stories inspired by the same pic-
ture would of necessity be alike we were very much astonished
to find that such was not the case and you will be delighted
as were the editors to find the wide divergence of interest in
the seven stories they certainly could not be more totally unlike
if we had specified that as one of the prize-winning requirements

  of course in each story there
  is the suspended ship and the
  ball-like space flyer but that is
  about all they have in common
  furthermore the treatment in
  each case is different for no two
  authors treated even this subject
  alike in the three stories you
  will find not only good fiction
  that keeps your interest but
  good science as well you will
  find that the authors have given
  careful thought to the smallest
  details and particularly to the
  vital scientific parts

  we are certain that you will
  hear more from the prize-win-
  ning authors all of them have
  the makings of future scientific-
  tion writers

  we would also like very much
  to have our readers comments
  on the prize-winning stories
  and the editors would like to
  know if they as judges would
  have awarded the prizes in the
  order given for that reason
  we have changed the voting cou-
  pon for this month to take care
  of this phase

  of course the prizes will be
  paid as announced here but if
  the readers should vote differ-
  ently their findings will be given
  in an early issue of amazing
  stories

next instant i seemed to be falling all sense of material existence vanished and in a whirl of confusion i seemed to be

astonishment that instead of resting on the bottom of the zeeth i was actually poised in space at the centre of the globe

the visitation

by cyril g wates

foreword

e narrative of the last voyage
s shah of iran to which voy-
greatest transformation the
s ever witnessed was directly
voyagi nich resulted in that
epoch-making year universally known as the
year of the visitation

  who i the writer may be is of little importance
and yet my name is not entirely unfamiliar to the
countless millions who will read this story and will
rejoice that the silence of nearly ninety years has
at last been broken and all the world may know
the events which took place on that extraordinary
voyage-events which have hitherto been wrapped
in mystery-at the request of those strange beings
who called themselves the deelathon but who
are better known to us today as the visitants
i am benedict clinton and i am the great-grand-
son of charles clinton who was captain of the
shah of iran captain clinton my great-grand-
father died yesterday at the age of nearly one hun-
dred and twenty-six years and his death unseals
my lips and releases me from the promise i made
to him a year ago on his birthday

  although as i have
stated my own personal-
ity is of no importance in
this narrative it affords
me a certain amused sat-
isfaction to realize that i
am perhaps the last his-
torian of the human race

owing to the changed con-
ditions under which we
live the professional his-
torian has become almost
as obsolete as the lawyer
or the alchemist of past
ages there is an old
saying that happy is the
nation which has no history and that proverb is
as true today as in the past except that for the
word nation we must substitute planet his-
tory is rightly defined as the record of the suffer-
ings of mankind without suffering there is noth-
ing deemed worthy of record

  during the past century the world has been
passing through the most extraordinary phase of
transition which ever has been or ever will be
known prior to the year -the year of the
visitation-humanity was divided by innumerable
lines largely artificial into hundreds of races and

nations since that date man has known only two
divisions those who were living at the time of
the visitation and those who were born afterwards

 we have adopted the two deelathon words
zykof and epzykof immortal and mortal in
referring to these two subdivisions of mankind and
the names convey a fairly clear picture of human
society of today we of the new generation the
zykofs having been born to a knowledge of the
thon glory in the prospect of a life which while
certainly not eternal is infinitely richer and hap-
pier and more extended than that which our fore-
fathers knew but sometimes we are saddened by
the sight of those who are nearest and dearest to
us growing older and dying before our very eyes
our friends the epzykofs who saw the great events
which transpired nearly a century ago and even as
in my great-grandfathers case were directly re-
sponsible for bringing about the visitation have
only an acquired and not an inborn knowledge of
the thon and therefore are not fated to share with
us for long the innumerable benefits it brings

  a year ago today i left my little workshop in the
palm groves of florida where i carve and decorate
the polar bosses for pleasure zeeths and before
evening i set foot on the pine-clad shores of van-
couver island i had
come with many of my
relatives and friends to
pay honor to captain
clinton on his one hun-
d r e d and twenty-fifth
birthday from all parts
of the world we came and
as i alighted from my
zeeth i was greeted by
several old friends who
had just arrived from
japan

  together we walk  up
the winding pathway
through the forest until
we saw the gleam of white marble and emerged
upon a wide lawn upon the farther side of which
half hidden in a group of graceful cedar trees was
capt clintons home with its fluted columns and
ellipsoidal roof the captain was seated upon the
steps his white hair shining like a beacon light in
the last rays of the setting sun and gathered
around him was a group of our relatives in ani-
mated conversation

  as we approached captain clinton rose and
came forward to greet us his fine figure still erect
apd his eyes bright with youth in spite of his fop

 tn introducing the new author of the prise story of
 our cover contest we believe you will agree with us
 that mr wates not only knows how to write interest-
 ingly and convincingly but he also keeps your interest
 from beginning to end nor does he allow you to guess
 what it is all about until the end selected from over
  stories you tnay be sure that it must be good the
 board of judges have awarded the first prise to a pre-
 viously unknown author the story not only is good
 fiction but contains excellent science we predict that
 we shall hear more from mr wates he seems to
 have the knack that only a few people have for writing
 scientifiction


amazing stories

aa epzykof great age for each he had a word of
welcome but it seemed that his handclasp to me
was especially cordial

   i am glad very glad that you have come bene-
dict he aid heartily i have a task for you to
 perform a very important task not without its
responsibilities and i hope that you will not refuse
the request of an old man

   that is a hope which will be realized as soon as
your request is made known i replied as for
the responsibility involved the fact that you have
selected me when all mankind delights to serve
you will give me strength to perform whatever
task you set me

  thank you benedict answered the captain
simply and turning to the others he said in this
happy world where perfect candor is universal i
have the doubtful honor of being the only man with
a secret as you all know i am the last survivor
of the crew of the shah of iran and soon i shall
go to join my shipmates tomorrow i will tell
benedict the story of my last voyage a story which
was to be kept secret until the last of us had sailed
for the home port when i am gone benedict will
write it out for all the world to read

  we surrounded him with loving words and ten-
der caresses not because he was the most famous
man in the world for nearly a hundred years but
because of his simple nobility we loved this fine
old sea captain of a past age thelma his eldest
daughter who with her companion john adair had
come from their home in spain that day slipped
her arm around her fathers neck and cried

  you must not leave us yet father dear you
have a hundred years of life in that big body of
yours still i believe you can beat me in a swim-
ming match even now for thelma was a famous
swimmer

   that remains to be proven my dear said the
captain with a little laugh half gay half sad

   prove it prove it thelma we cried and soon
we were all running down the path to the shore
where we plunged into the warm waters of the
pacific

   thelma beat her father by a length her white
body flashing through the water like an ivory
zeeth cleaving the air we remained sporting in
the bay until the daylight died and the big moon
rose

   as we loitered up the hill my great-grandfather
drew me back from the gay crowd

  i should like you to climb the shah with me
in the morning benedict he said i want to
watch the sun rise-who knows it may be for the
last time-and then i will tell you the story of my
last voyage and the visitation of the deelathon
will you come

  the half light of dawn was just touching th
snow-capped peaks in the east when capt clinton
and i started our ascent of the shah the little
mountain just behind his home to which he had
attached the name of his old ship we tiptoed
down the steps in order not to disturb the sleeping
guests whose white forms lay-

star-scattered on the grass

-as old omar puts it soon we werehigh up
among the rocky buttresses of the shah an hour

of exhilarating climbing brought us to the summit
and we sat on a flat boulder to watch the ever-new
miracle of the dawn

  to the east shone the placid waters of queen
charlotte sound sparkling like molten gold in the
radiance of the rising sun beyond towered the
mountains of the mainland lifting their snowy
heads above their mantle of green to the west
the waters of the pacific widened to an unbroken
horizon

  at last the captain broke the silence and for an
hour i sat spellbound listening to his deep voice
telling the story of that last voyage-the voyage
of the visitation

             chapter i
             the meteor

you must often have wondered said capt
clinton in common with the rest of the
world why no person among the crew or pas-
sengers of the shah of iran has ever revealed what
took place on the last voyage of the old ship the
reason for this secrecy on the subject which is nat-
urally of more than average interest to everyone
is quite simple	

  when the deelathon conceded to our request to
make the visitation it was upon the express under-
standing that the location of their country should
be concealed they pointed out to us that it was
impossible to foresee the outcome of the visita-
tion and they wanted to insure their own safety in
any event

  this request was so entirely reasonable that we
all unhesitatingly agreed to it we realized that it
was not possible to release into the world a tre-
mendous force like the thon without producing a
widespread upheaval which might be beneficent or
the reverse we decided that the simplest way of
preserving the secret was to make a pact among
ourselves that the entire story of the voyage should
remain untold until the last of us was dead if it
seemed wise in the light of events which were still
in the future the last living member of the party
was to tell the story to some dear friend who would
publish it after his death

  this then benedict continued the captain is
the task i am asking you to undertake say noth-
ing until i am gone and then publish what i am
about to tell you word for word as i shall tell it
as you may easily do by the aid of the thon i
feel that my end is not far off all possibility of
danger to our friends and benefactors the deela-
thon has long passed away and the necessity for
preserving their secret no longer exists and now
for my story

  the shah of iran of which i was captain was
one of a line of huge steamers which made the jour-
ney between vancouver and australia in the fifth
decade of the twentieth century these great ves-
sels which became obsolete with the introduction of
the zeeth were magnificently equipped according
to the strange standards of that time and were so
powerful that although they floated upon the sur-
face of the water they had little to fear from the
worst storms they were likely to encounter they
carried a thousand passengers and a large crew
the visitation



not only to handle the elaborate machinery and to
navigate the vessel but also to attend to the thou-
sand and one wants of the thousand passengers

  on the seventeenth day of september  vwe
sailed from vancouver on a pleasure tour for which
the shah of iran had been chartered we were to
touch at san francisco manzanillo and panama
before striking across the pacific for sidney the
voyage was uneventful until we left the isthmus
and were three days journey southwest of the
galapagos islands i was standing on the bridge
with my chief officer a fine fellow named ian mc-
fane you knew him benedict

  the sun was rising ian and i were discussing
some matter relating to the navigation of the ship
when a sailor came running up the steps and touch-
ing his cap as was the custom in those days ex-
claimed 

  beg pardon sir theres something wrong
with the sun

  ian mcfane and i both looked to the east and
both cried out in astonishment exactly in the
centre of the golden disc was a round spot this
spot was perfectly black and about one-quarter the
apparent diameter of the sun

  what do you make of that mr mcfane i
asked

  well i hardly know sir replied the mate
its too big and black to be a sun-spot and besides
its moving

  sure enough as we watched the spot it crept
slowly to the edge of the sun and in about ten min-
utes had left the disc altogether and vanished

  it is some opaque object between us and the
sun i said

  some new kind of plane maybe suggested
ian

i i doubt it mister i replied it simply van-
ished when it left the solar disc and that would
show that its outside the atmosphere more likely
a big meteorite

   if that was a meteorite and it hits the earth
were going to know it said ian

   well dont start that idea circulating among the
passengers i replied we dont want a small
sized panic on our hands and anyway we may be
entirely wrong in supposing that it was a
meteorite

   my warning proved to be useless for when i de-
scended to the promenade deck i found many of the
passengers gathered in groups discussing the
strange phenomenon which had been seen by sev-
eral early risers

  the sews of the curious black spot on the sun
spread like wild-fire and as soon as i made my ap-
pearance i was surrounded by a group of pas-
sengers clamoring for an explanation

   im sorry ladies and gentlemen i said but i
am as much at a loss to explain the spot as your-
selves i can only suggest that it may have been a
small very dense cloud

  but that wouldnt explain why it vanished when
it passed off the face of the sun objected one of
the ladies oh here comes professor smithton
hell be able to tell us all about it and the group
broke away from me and re-formed around the

famous astronomer and physicist who had just ar-
rived on deck

of course i knew that my theory of a dense
cloud was ridiculous but i was anxious to
avoid any suggestion that might cause alarm
among the passengers a panic is a nasty thing
to handle and would have reflected seriously upon
my management and indirectly upon the shipping
company

  i walked across the deck in time to hear the pro-
fessor giving his opinion in his best lecture-room
style he had not seen the spot himself so he was
obliged to base his judgment upon the descriptions
of the few who had been on deck at the time he
listened to all carefully and then said laughing

i have no doubt that this spot on the sun seems
very mysterious to all of you even you captain
but the explanation is after all extremely simple
there was a murmur of surprise followed by de-
mands for enlightenment

  the spot you saw was simply a parachute de-
scending from an aeroplane flyinjj at a height so
great that it was invisible the spot was oval
rather than round was it not

  again there was a babble of voices some saying
that the spot was distinctly oval others that it was
quite round when there was silence the professor
continued apparently quite deaf to any evidence
that did not fit in with his preconceived theory

  ah quite so distinctively oval he said
due to the angle of vision of course and rub-
bing his hands together with the air of a man who
has cleared away all possible doubt he disappeared
into the saloon and was soon engrossed in a hearty
breakfast an excellent example which all the pas-
sengers followed

  so thats that remarked ian who had come
up during the discourse

  yes i replied dryly t least it would be if it
had been a parachute fortunately for the profes-
sors-reputation for scientific infallibility no one
except ourselves seems to have noticed that the spot
left the sun at its upper edge if anyone has in-
vented a rising parachute i havent heard of it
throughout the day the shah of iran continued
to plough her way southward through an ocean as
smooth as the proverbial sheet of glass the
weather was perfect although the heat was oppres-
sive but that was to be expected during a calm
just south of the equator

  in the late afternoon a slight swell manifested
itself getting gradually heavier until at sunset thq
steamer was perceptibly pitching in spite of hep
gyroscopic stabilizers the air was still motionless
the only breeze being due to the speed of the ves-
sel and the sky was absolutely cloudless

  i went to my cabin early and turned in but could
not sleep an oppressive sense of impending dis-
aster descended upon me like a pall and resisted
all my efforts to shake it off at last i rose and
dressed i went out on the bridge where i found
ian mcfane talking to the officer of the watch
gordon caswell the third mate both were look-
ing up at the sky where the stars were sparkling
with tropical brilliancy


amazing stories

  im glad you came out sir said ian but what
is the trouble

  i couldnt sleep i exclaimed the heat i
guess

  it sure is hot even for the tropics said cas-
well

  what are you two looking at i queried
theres something funny about the stars re-
plied caswell and he pointed up towards the west

  following the direction of his finger i saw the
galaxy or milky way as it is commonly called
shining like a belt of silver spray across the vel-
vety sky about fifty degrees above the horizon
appeared a perfectly circular patch approximately
three times the diameter of the moon within this
area the stark of the galaxy were blotted out giv-
ing exactly the appearance of the coal sack that
curious vacant space which has been familiar to as-
tronomers for centuries

  what do you think it is sir asked ian the
spot we saw this morning

  it looks unpleasantly like it i said and it
also looks as though my theory of a huge meteorite
or a wandering asteroid were correct

  if so it must be moving with tremendous
speed said caswell it has doubled in size dur-
ing the half hour that mr mcfane and i have been
watching it

  i dont like the looks of it i said if that
thing hits the sea anywhere near the boat theres
going to be one gosh-awful explosion mr mc-
fane will you kindly have all hands called on deck
and quietly please tell the chief steward to post
men in all doorways and corridors to keep the pas-
sengers below decks in case of accident tell them
to use tact and avoid a panic at all costs

  in ten minutes my orders had been carried out
and the entire crew were standing by waiting for
-we knew not what

  the swell of the afternoon had increased rapidly
to huge proportions but the waves were so long
and unbroken that the shah rode them with ease
mcfane caswell and i stood on the bridge watch-
ing that ominous disc in the sky spreading until
it had blotted out fully one-eighth of the stars in
the southwestern quadrant

  suddenly the edges of the black circle were sur-
rounded by an awful halo of flame far quicker
than i can describe it the whole surface of the
meteor if that was what it was had turned to a
white heat so intense that we were blinded by the
glare as the visitor from interstellar space tore
its furious way through the hundred miles of our
atmosphere the whole expanse of ocean became as
light as day great streams of molten lava shot
out in every direction and yet most ghastly touch
of all absolute silence reigned

  the blazing meteor struck the sea exactly at the
horizon that is to say about twenty miles away we
had a momentary glimpse of a fearful column of
boiling water wreathed in clouds of steam hurling
itself towards the zenith and then-darkness

  in the breathless silence my voice rang out
hard a-starbod and the great ship began to
swing around in order to place her stem towards the

point from which i was sure the inevitable danger
must come

  and then came the noise

no words of mine can hope to describe the fright-
ful bellowing tumult of that explosion first
came the shrill shriek produced by the brief passage
of the meteor through our atmosphere following
this was a roar as if all the artillery of all the
armies and navies of that unhappy old world of ours
had been fired simultaneously and the sound multi-
plied a thousand-fold

  every man whose position exposed him to the di-
rect force of the blast was hurled to the deck and
many were injured cries of pain from the deck
and screams of fear from the staterooms were
mingled with the continuous soul-shattering blasts
of noise as the white hot meteor uttered its indig-
nant protests at being sunk in four miles of salt
water

  and last came the storm

  as when a boy casts a pebble into a pond to watch
the ripples spread so when the hand of fate cast
into the greatest pond on earth a pebble forty miles
in diameter ripples fled out in all directions but
these ripples were walls of water a hundred feet in
height and moving with incredible rapidity

  in a moment the vessel was caught up and hurled
eastward with the speed of an express train in
vain her powerful screws beat the water in a brave
endeavor to stem the force of a two hundred mile
hurricane we were helpless and could only trust
in the mercy of god the strength of steel plates and
the knowledge that hundreds of miles of open sea
lay between us and the coasts of south america

  you know benedict that there has been a pre-
vailing impression for the last ninety years that the
deelathon arrived from the realms of space upon
the meteor whose shattered fragments now form an
island in the pacific we who could have contra-
dicted that idea were pledged to silence but no one
who had witnessed that hellish globe descend from
the heavens and the tempest that followed it could
have believed for a moment that any living being
could have survived such a cataclysm 

  for five hours we drove before the storm the
bellow of the cooling meteor had long since died
away in the west but was replaced by the tumult
of the wind and waves it would take too long to
tell you all the terror of that awful night a dozen
times it seemed impossible that we could remain
afloat another moment and a dozen times the im-
possible happened

  just before four oclock the waves died down as
suddenly as they had arisen and the shah of iran
rested on an even keel in smooth water

  the rain still poured down and the roar of the
tempest could be heard as it were far overhead
the darkness was stygian and it was impossible to
see more than a hundred yards in any direction
even with the aid of the shahs powerful search-
light i untied the rope with which i had lashed
myself to the bridge rail and staggered over to
mcfane	i

  its pretty obvious that we have been driven by
some miracle into a shfeltered harbor on the south
american coast i said
the visitation



  if thats so sir replied ian its a miracle in-
deed

  aye and thats not the only miracle said cas-
wells voice we were three hundred miles off the
coast when the meteor struck and that means weve
been travelling over sixty miles an hour

  id be willing to believe you said ian if you
told me it was a hundred

  well thank god its over i said mr mc-
fane please have a sounding made and if were in
shallow water as i suspect drop anchor we dont
want to drift on the rocks

  by the time these instructions had been carried
out the storm outside had somewhat abated but as
the tumult of the wind became less i noticed a con-
tinuous roar which at first i attributed to breakers
on the rocks outside the harbor on glancing at the
compass i was surprised to find that the sound came
from the west the probable direction of the land

  in about an hour the noise of the wind had died
to a whisper and then the roar from the west be-
came very noticeable caswell who had remained
on the bridge called my attention to the fact that
the sound was practically steady and therefore could
not be breakers

  well we shall have to wait for daylight to see
what it is i said im going down now to see how
the passengers have stood the racket call me if
you see or hear anything unusual

  i found the passengers huddled in the main sa-
loon most of them showing evidence of the severe
strain to which they had been exposed but the
ships doctor reported that aside from one broken
arm and a few bruises there were no injuries

  weve certainly got to hand it to professor
smithton sir said the doctor he did more than
any of us to keep the crowd under control he was
as cool as if he were in his class room

  having given orders for coffee and biscuits to be
served as soon as possible i was going from one
group to another with assurances that all danger
was now past when the fourth officer came hur-
riedly down the stairs and told me that mr caswell
wanted me on deck at once

as i reached the deck i saw that dawn was break-
ing the curtain of rain had been withdrawn
and  was able to take in at a glance the extraor-
dinary chance to which we all owed our lives

  the shah was lying peacefully at anchor in a little
bay surrounded by sheer black cliffs which seemed
in the dim light to tower to a height of at least a
thousand feet on all sides the harbor was shaped
like a pear with the narrow part-the stem-to-
wards the open sea

  the steady roaring sound still continued and
seemed to come from a point in the cliffs directly
opposite the entrance to the bay which was about
a mile across at its broadest part the width of
the stem was certainly not above a quarter of a
mile and you will understand my feelings benedict
when i tell you that the sight of that narrow gap
in the beetling cliffs literally turned me sick we
had all been under too great a strain all night to
realize our plight clearly but the thought of what
would have happened if ye had missed that narrow
opening-

  i went up cm the bridge and joined caswell i
began to make some remark on the providential
chance which had brought us safely into the harbor
when i saw that he was paying no attention to me
but was gazing intently to the westward

  whats the trouble mr caswell i asked

  well sir i dont know if the light of that meteor
has affected my eyesight but would you mind telling
me how we got in here

             chapter ii
             imprisoned

startled at gordon caswells strange ques-
tion i followed the direction of his gaze and
saw with amazement that the entire breadth of
the harbor mouth was bridged by a natural break-
water against which the waves from the open pa-
cific were bursting in columns of spray no open-
ing was visible in the reef and i was completely at
a loss to answer caswells question as to how we
had crossed it a steamer of thirty thousand tons
does not fly and even allowing for the height of the
waves it was hardly conceivable that we could have
been washed over the reef without grounding

  there must be an opening somewhere mr cas-
well i said when you have had breakfast and
its lighter please take number three launch and
explore the reef

  while the second officer was away the passengers
began to throng the decks and many were the ex-
pressions of wonder at the remarkable harbor into
which we had so providentially been carried the
black cliffs which lost none of their height with the
increasing light were not smooth but broken by ver-
tical seams at regular intervals the whole scene
reminded me of some picture i had seen i could not
tell where it was ian mcfane whose birthplace
was in northern scotland who remarked on the close
resemblance between these cliffs and the basaltic
formation of the famous fingalls cave in the he-
brides the vertical clefts we observed were indeed
the spaces between huge hexagonal columns extend-
ing from the surface of the water to the top of the
cliffs without a break giving the semblance of a
gigantic temple built for some ghastly cult of devil
worship

  the water was almost without a ripple and the
tier of thousand foot columns unbroken except at
the point from which the thundering roar still came
here appeared a gap forming a narrow gorge and
the mirror-like surface of the sea was broken by a
considerable stream which cascaded over broken
blocks of basalt it was apparent that the roar we
heard came from a huge waterfall hidden from our
sight in the recesses of the canyon

  caswell returned at noon his report only served
to increase our bewilderment with three of the
men he had landed at the base of the cliffs where the
southern end of the reef abutted against them or-
dering the launch to follow them at some distance
from the rocks they had walked northward along
the broken tops of basaltic columns similar to those
of which the cliffs were composed

  about half way along the reef they were stopped
by a torrent of water flowing across the barrier into


amazing stories

 the open sea and were obliged to signal to the
 launch to pick them up

   landing again at the northern end of the reef
 they walked back to the central stream without find-
 ing any trace of an opening the stream was too
 narrow to permit the passage of such a vessel as the
 shah even had the water been sufficiently deep
 which was obviously not the case

   they crossed the reef which was about two hun-
 dred yards in width and looked out upon the open
 pacific still heaving in long rollers the aftermath
 of the storm of the previous night they returned
 to the shah completely nonplussed

   having listened to caswells report i thought it
 best to take the passengers into our confidence
 mounting the orchestra platform in the grand sa-
  loon i made a short speech in which i stated that
 the shah of iran was imprisoned in a land-locked
 harbor how she got there i could not explain but
 it was impossible to get her out with anything
 short of dynamite which naturally we did not pos-
 sess

  there is no possible cause for alarm ladies and
 gentlemen i said the shah is provisioned for a
 long voyage and is perfectly safe in this bay as
 soon as the necessary arrangements can be made i
 will send an expedition inland to the nearest settle-
 ment which affords telegraphic or radio facilities
 our own radio is unfortunately damaged beyond
 possibility of repair in a few weeks at the latest
 a relief boat will arrive bringing the necessary
 explosive to release the shah and i think i can
 promise you all some entertainment when the blast-
 ing begins in the meantime i hope everyone will
 make the best of a bad job

   there was some applause and when it subsided
 professor smithton arose and asked for permission
 to question the second officer

   will you kindly describe the nature of the beach
 along the barrier reef mr caswell said the pro-
 fessor

   the fact is said caswell there is no beach of
 any kind on either side of the reef the rocks go
 straight down into the water

   one more question said the professor do
 the ends of the reef lie conformably against the
 cliffs i mean he explained smiling at caswells
 evident bewilderment do the rocks fit closely to-
 gether	v

   no sir they do not he replied they are very
 much broken up at both ends

   ah quite so ejaculated the professor with
 i satisfaction i think i can explain the mystery of
 i our arrival even if i did make a slight though per-
 fectly excusable mistake about the parachute and
 he smiled blandly at his audience when the shah
 entered the harbor the reef was not there
 v not there i exclaimed

   quite so the absence of beaches and the uncon-
 formable-excuse me i should say broken condition
 of the ends of the reef show that it was recently
 raised above the water the parachute-beg par-
 don the meteor was apparently about forty miles in
 diameter judging by the area of sky it obscured
 when it touched our atmosphere if its composition
 were similar to that of most meteors it would weigh
 in the neighborhood of fifty million million tons it

 is hardly to be expected that such a missile could
 strike the earth at a velocity of perhaps three hun-
 dred thousand miles per hour without causing wide-
 spread seismic disturbances which would flow
 through the solid glolae in ripples from the point of
 impact it is these ripples which were mainly re-
 sponsible for the storm which may be regarded as
 a series of tidal waves and it was these ripplesor
 rather oneof them which raised the barrier reef
 and cut us off from the ocean-fortunately after we
 entered the bay

  the professor was going on to enlarge on his sub-
ject when the quartermaster entered the room and
came up to where i was standing

  beg pardon sir mr mcfane told me to tell you
that the ship is sinking

for the second time we came very near having a
serious panic i rushed on deck but could see no
signs of anything to give basis for ians message
in reply to my questions he informed me that he had
gone down into the launch which was still floating
alongside to get some specimens of basalt which
caswell had brought from the reef while there he
noticed that the shah was floating nearly a foot
deeper than when she left port he had given orders
to have all compartments examined for a leak be-
fore reporting to me but could find nothing

  meanwhile the excitement among the passengers
was fast getting beyond control when the professor
began waving his arms and shouting for silence

  ladies and gentlemen there is no cause for
alarm the shah is perfectly safe as i hope to
prove in a few minutes captain will you kindly
have one of your men draw a bucket of sea water
i nodded to ian to have the request carried out
and the professor disappeared into his stateroom
returning in a few moments with a wooden case
from which he took a thin glass tube with a bulb at
one end he dropped this into the bucket of water
where it floated upright having examined it care-
fully he straightened up and said

  ah quite so it is not the ship that is respons-
ible for this unwarranted alarm but fhe sea the
normal specific gravity of water is of course 
while that of sea water is about  now the
specific gravityof this water is only  so nat-
urally the ship has settled

  but what could possibly cause such a state of
affairs professor i demanded

  ah quite simple captain the sea water has
been cut off by the reef leaving the shallow harbor
land-locked there is a tremendous amount of fresh-
water running into the bay from that canyon at the
western end and it is forcing out the salt water over
the reef as mr caswell told us naturally the ship
is settling and will continue to do so- and he
made a dramatic pause -for about six inches fur-
ther when the water will be entirely fresh
needless to say the professors stock which had
slumped after the parachute fiasco and made a
quick recovery during the meeting in the saloon
went sky high as the result of this second example
of scientific acumen indeed i was so much im-
pressed with prof smithtons versatility common
sense and unfailing good nature that i invited him
to attend a conference of the officers to be held that
the visitation



afternoon for the purpose of laying definite plans
for sending out a relief party

  at the professors suggestion i also asked two
young men named alderson and fitzgerald athletic
young fellows both members of the english and
american alpine clubs who were enroute to new
zealand to attempt the ascent of an unclimbed peak
in the southern alps

  when these three passengers and the officers were
gathered in the smoking room i made a brief out-
line of the situation and asked for suggestions ex-
plaining that the important thing was to get in
touch with civilization as soon as possible

  the professor rose and asked if i could state the
approximate location of the shah and whether it
would not be better to send out a relief party by sea
rather than by land

  i am afraid that it is impossible to give a satis-
factory answer to your first question professor we
have no way of determining how far north or south
we were carried by the storm and the heavy pall of
clouds makes an observation out of the question

  ah quite so the clouds are undoubtedly the
result of the immense amount of steam produced by
contact betwen the meteor and the ocean i venture
to predict that on account of the great size of the
meteor which would preclude more than a small
portion being immersed these clouds will continue
for a long period of time

  with regard to sending out a party by sea i
continued i had thought of that possibility but
aside from the great difficulty of transporting one
of the launches across the reef there are two serious
objections to that plan one is that the sea is too
rough for a small craft to navigate in safety and
the other is that all our launches are electric and
intended for short trips the storage batteries
would not last for over a couple of days at the out-
side

  ah quite so said the professor then i ven-
ture to suggest captain that you send a party on
shore at the mouth of the river tomorrow and de-
termine the feasibility of reaching the top of the
cliffs i foresee that the presence of a waterfall
might prove a serious obstruction here is where
the mountaineering skill of our two young friends
mr alderson and mr fitzgerald will be invalu-
able if the cliffs are successfully surmounted you
can then arrange the personnel of your party and
the necessary outfit of provisions

  the professors suggestions met with unanimous
approval no sooner did the result of our confer-
ence become known than a number of the passengers
asked my permission to accompany the proposed
expedition thus it happened that a large and light-
hearted party crossed the strip of smooth water that
separated us from the shore and set foot on the
narrow beach just north of the mouth of the river

chapter iii
the coming of the deelathon

accompanied by the professor and the two
a mountaineers i led the way inlands pres-
-i a ently we approached the point where the
river made its way through the wall of cliffs and
turning sharply to the north scrambled over masses

of fallen rock into the entrance of the canyon the
roar of falling water growing louder as we advanced

  above the fallen rock we turned to the right
around a magnificent group of the hexagonal basalt
columns and the words of some remark i was about
to make died on my lips in sheer wonderment we
were confronted with a sight which for appalling
grandeur is probably unequalled anywhere on earth

  we stood on the edge of a vast cup-like depres-
sion in the rock on every side towered the pillars
of basalt as smooth and perfect as though they had
been carved and polished by the hand of man on
the farther side of this huge theatre the river de-
scended from the brow of the cliffs in one mighty
thousand-foot leap to strike squarely on the edge
of the great cup which was filled to the brim with a
churning mass of foam while the deafening roar of
the tortured waters echoed and re-echoed from the
black walls

  so tremendous were the cliffs that we stood as it
were at the bottom of a circular pit and the light
that filtered down from above was but a dim simili-
tude of day

  for a long time we stood transfixed with awe
while the other members of the party gradually
joined us their laughter quenched by the wonder of
the sight that met their gaze as our eyes became
more accustomed to the half-light we were able to
see that it was only around the rocky margins of the
pool that the water was beaten into foam the en-
tire centre was occupied by a mass of water per-
fectly smooth and piled up like a dome of glass

  at first sight this central mass seemed motionless
but we soon realized that its whole surface was the
playground of titanic forces the entire structure
quivered as though it were in a state of the most
delicate equilibrium as indeed it was and it seemed
as though one had only to throw a pebble to see it
dissolve in a slather of foam like a giant bubble

  presently the voice of the professor broke the
spell

  im a old man captain and in my time ive seen
the glories of the starry heavens as perhaps few
have done but i thank god that he has spared me
to see this

  i thought the great snow peaks were the most
beautiful things in creation said fitzgerald but
this has got them all beat

  and look at the light fred exclaimed his sis-
ter who had joined us its like all the opals in the
world rolled into one or rather like a soap bubble
on the point of bursting for these colors move

  miss fitzgeralds exclamation brought us to the
realization that this water was not like other water
but seemed to glow with an effulgence of its own
streamers of light of every imaginable color darted
here and there over the shining surface of the great
dome now blending into masses of rose or green or
violet now mingling in a glittering confusion of
rainbow hues

  of course we knew that we were looking at some
remarkable natural optical illusion caused by the
reflection of the light from above but the effect was
none the less impressive the living shining dome
of color set in its girdle of snowy foam the silent
cliffs with their ebony towers the thundering col-
umn of water eternally descending from above all


amazing stories

combined into a dramatic whole whose overwhelm-
ing grandeur was foiled by a broad band of emerald
green turf which framed the central cup and was
dotted here and there with graceful palm trees
whose fronds glistened with diamond drops of spray

  at last i tore my eyes from that living opal and
turned to the two mountaineers

  well gentlemen what do you think of our
chances of getting out of this

  hopeless replied alderson

  absolutely agreed fitzgerald were by way
of being mountaineers but were not flies theres
not a handhold anywhere but good lord whats
that

  at his cry of surprise we all looked up to behold
poised in the air above the rim of the waterfall a
great ball like a gigantic soap bubble

  your parachute i guess professor said cas-
well slyly look its coming down

very slowly the ball descended into the abyss
and now we realized that it was far larger than
we had at first supposed it was apparently made
of some transparent material like glass except that
it glittered with the same play of colors as that
which appeared on the surface of the pool around
the centre of the balloon if balloon it was was a
broad band of some metal such as copper or gold
this girdle formed the equator and at either pole
was a projecting boss of the same metal from which
were suspended by cables inverted cups which hung
some distance below the globe

  as the strange aerial visitor drew nearer we saw
that the equatorial band was studded at intervals
with circular windows of the glassy material from
the centre of each of these projected a long needle
the purpose of which we could not guess unless they
were for directing the course of the vessel-a theory
which we afterwards found to be correct

  very slowly the great ball sank until the two cups
touched the grassy sward about three hundred yard
from us still it sank the cables from which the
cups were suspended being withdrawn into the two
metal bosses until the lower edge of the central
girdle was but a foot above the ground here the
shining sphere hung swaying gently in the wind
that rose from the churning water

  a moment later one of the circular windows
swung open and a figure stepped down upon the
grass followed by several others they started to
walk around the margin of the pool towards us and
as they drew nearer the professor exclaimed in sur-
prise

  good heavens theyre indians look at the
headdress

  dont worry sir charles i said were
armed and i drew my revolver from its holster
but as i did so i had a curious sensation that my
warlike act was a gesture absolutely without mean-
ing

  oh i wasnt afraid replied sir charles but
they havent got any-i mean theyre rather lightly
clad for polite society you know

  the group from the sphere were now near enough
for me to see that sir charles was correct there
were five or six men and two women and each wore
only a great headdress of what seemed to be white

feathers i also realized that these were no indians
the color of the skin which had at a distance ap-
peared coppery was now revealed as rosy pink not
due to the presence of any coloring pigment but as
though the skin were so transparent and the health
so abounding that the blood literally shone through

  i began to agree with sir charles that it would
be wise for the ladies to retire while we interviewed
these strange inhabitants i turned to make some
such suggestion and caught sight of margaret fitz-
gerald staring at the approaching party her eyes
shining with excitement

  there was a burst of admiration from the pas-
sengers men and women joining in exclamations of
delight at the physical perfection and nobility of
countenance of these splendid beings who were now
only a few yards from us

  the party came to a halt and one of the tallest of
the men stepped forward and saluted us with a
curious but graceful gesture as he did so i real-
ized with a distinct shock that what we had taken to
be a feather headdress was not a headdress at all
but was a semi-transparent membranous frill actu-
ally growing upon the heads of these beings this
frill or thonmelek as we afterwards learned was
their word for it ran across the forehead just in
front of the hair down each side of the neck over
the shoulders and terminated just above the elbows
i know of nothing which it so much resembled as
the fin of a flying fish except that the thonmelek
was infinitely more delicate but it was supported
upon blades of cartilage in much the same way all
this we absorbed at a glance and then the tall man
evidently the appointed spokesman of the party ad-
dressed us

  deelarana deelathon zeloma ek tara and rais-
ing their hands in the same graceful gesture all the
others echoed zeloma

  zeloma exclaimed sir charles i say cap-
tain it sounds as if they were giving us a salute of
welcome

  yes i agree with you i replied and they all
have the kindliest smile i ever saw on human coun-
tenance i am certain they mean us no harm

  i turned back to the tall stranger with the inten-
tion of trying to convey our friendliness to him by
means of signs when his lips opened and he said in
the most perfect english without a trace of accent

  yes i welcome you us the deelathon mean
no harm welcome

of all the strange incidents of this strange voy-
age i think this was the most astonishing a
thrill of excitement passed through the crowd we
sophisticated citizens of the twentieth century had
discovered an unknown country inhabited by an un-
known race as beautiful as angels who wore no
clothes grew a frill on their foreheads and-spoke
english without an accent true they spoke it
mechanically and not quite correctly but it was
english

  you speak english friend  i exclaimed

  the tall man shook his head and smiled

  but you understand it

  he smiled again and said yes

  why captain cried miss fitzgerald this is
like a romance out of a book
the visitation



  at these apparently innocent words our visitors
the deelathon for you will have guessed that it
was they showed their first sign of excitement and
we saw that their frills or thonmeleks which were
normally pearly white flashed with rainbow colors
like the surface of the dome of water one of the
girls stepped forward and spoke rapidly in their
soft musical language several times repeating the
word book

 now it happened that miss fitzgerald had
brought a volume of emersons essays with her to
read while her brother and mr alderson were ex-
ploring the cliffs she smiled and handed it to the
lovely girl saying

  this is a book

  the two deelathon examined the volume with
great interest and then the man handed it back to
miss fitzgerald with a questioning look

  it is a book she said we read it

  at once the tall man caught up her words

  read it he exclaimed read it

  miss fitzgerald turned to me in surprise they
say they cant speak english she said and yet
they-keep on speaking it i dont understand
dont you see replied her brother they just
say the words we say-like parrots

  no i dont agree with you mr fitzgerald
interrupted prof smithton it is true that they
repeat our words but they combine them intelli-
gently into new sentences almost as though they
could read our thoughts

  the tall man listened attentively to this discussion
and then smiling pointed to the book and repeated
read

  perhaps you had better do as they ask i said
to miss fitzgerald

  and then took place one of the strangest scenes
i have ever witnessed at a gesture from their
leader the deelathon seated themselves on the grass
and we followed their example for an hour nothing
but the boom of the waterfall and the soft sweet
voice of the american girl reading to those gods
and goddesses the words of the great american
essayist could be heard at first she stopped at
intervals and looked up but the deelathon would say
softly read

  and she continued

  at last when she had read fully half of the book
the tall man put up hishands to check her and rose
to his feet

  friends from the sea he said we the people
of the thon welcome you the speakers of a strange
harsh language until this moment unknown to us
we ask you to forgive our seeming inhospitality but
of course you realize that it was impossible for us
to address you in your own language until we had
heard it spoken therefore i asked this beautiful
maiden to read from her record which she calls a
book

  but enough of this matter of speech which doubt-
less you already know by the thon now that we
are able to talk freely accept our welcome and hos-
pitality and then tell us how we the deelathon may
serve you i am toron maker of zeeths and this
is my companion torona and he laid his hand

gently upon the head of the girl who had asked miss
fitzgerald for the book

  to say that we were dumfounded at this fluent
address from a being who only an hour previously
had said us mean no harm would be putting it
very mildly for a few moments we were too as-
tonished to reply the professor was the first to
regain his wits he rose bowed courteously and
said strangers who call yourselves the deelathon
we thank you for your welcome i am professor
smithton and this is captain clinton we with
many others were driven into this harbor by the
terrible storm and escape has been cut off there-
fore we seek a way inland

  but have you no zeeths asked torona
i am afraid not replied the professor smiling
we do not even know what a zeeth may be

  you do not know exclaimed the deelathon
girl her thonmelek rippling with color but does
not the thon tell you

  again i must admit ignorance replied smith-
ton i do not even know what you mean by the
thon

  at these words the deelathon leaped to their feet
in uncontrollable excitement their thonmeleks
furled and unfurled flashing with a hundred hues
and we heard repeatedly the words zeel epthona
thon they know not the thon

  finally toron turned to us and said

  you will forgive our unseemly emotion smith-
ton and you clinton we were surprised at your
apparent inability to understand us when we spoke
our own language we are doubly astonished that
you are surprised at our fluent english but we are
astounded at your statement that you do not know
the thon and can only suppose two things either
that you and your friends are very unhappy or that
you say the thing which is epthona-or as you
would express it untrue

  i can only assure you friend toron said the
professor earnestly that we are not guilty of false-
hood when we say we do not know this thon neither
are we especially unhappy though what connection
that has with the thon i do not understand

  and are there many like you in the world
asked one of the deelathon men wonderingly
people who know not the thon and who have lost
their thonmeleks and he passed his hand upward
over that glittering appendage

  there are countless millions replied the pro-
fessor

  what you tell us said toron fills us with
sorrow true we of the deelathon have a legend
that a people existed upon the face of the earth who
knew not the wonderful benefits which are con-
stantly showered upon us by the thon-ta-zheena
but we did not believe it possible it seemed like a
story of fish flying through the air or birds who
lived under water the news you tell us we must
carefully consider we will return to our people and
i will call a conference of the klendeela in the
meantime return to your zeeth-that-floats-on-the-
water and at sunset i will visit you

  the deelathon raised their hands in salutation
folded their thonmeleks and returned to the crystal
globe which presently rose steadily into the air and
disappeared over the brink of the waterfall


amazing stories

as soon as we set foot once more on the deck of
shah of iran i left the passengers to narrate to
their friends who had remained on board the
strange events through which we had passed and
beckoning to professor smithton conducted him to
my cabin and closed the door

  when we had lighted our cigars i said

  well professor what do you make of it
candidly captain there are a good many things
i dont understand at all

  this thon they talked about so much for ex-
ample i said and how they were able to talk
english so fluently

  well no said smithton thoughtfully i think
i begin to have a hazy idea of what they were driv-
ing at

  thats more than i have i said

  no the things i cant fathom the professor
went on are what supports that dome of water and
why it shines like a fire-opal and what holds up that
crystal balloon of theirs and why they have frills on
their heads and a few other things like that but

the thon- didnt you notice how that word

kept on creeping up in their language deelathon
-people of the thon thonmelek-that frill of
theirs do they name themselves for their natural
headdress

  that would hardly explain their tremendous ex-
citement when they discovered we didnt know this
thon of theirs i objected and why they regarded
us as so unhappy because we didnt have frilly
things on our heads

  ah quite so mused the professor but they
also said epthona and translated it as untrue i
believe ive got it and he jumped up and began
to pace the cabin excitedly thon means truth
they worship some god or fetish which stands for
truth and naturally they think were a benighted
race because we dont follow their religion

  but that doesnt explain their sudden command
of english i objected

  quite so  said the professor

  there was a knock at my door and miss fitz-
gerald peeped in

  am i intruding on a conference

  not at all i said please come in and see if
your intuition can solve what to our more masculine
reason is as black as ink

  what is the problem captain she asked seat-
ing herself on the edge of my desk i explained
that the professor and i had been discussing the
strange inhabitants of the mainland and trying to
decide what they meant by thon

  margaret fitzgerald looked first at me and then
at the professor her eyes twinkling

  honestly i dont know any more about it than
you do but i think i can guess

  what is it i exclaimed

  why you said it when i came in she said
  ah truth said smithton

  no not exactly i was thinking of what the
captain said he asked me to use my supposed in-
tuition thats it intuition thon

  by heaven youre right cried the professor
some highly developed sense of intuition combined
with marvelous memories and reasoning powers
which enabled them to understand our language

after hearing the words once marvellous theyre
mental prodigies that explains their idea that we
are so miserable because we havent got their
thon

  i dont think it explains everything professor
i replied i feel that there is some deeper meaning
underlying that simple word thon theres some-
thing about those people that makes me say that
if this thon of theirs could make me like them-
like them not only physically but mentally and mor-
ally-id never rest until i solved the mystery

  i felt the same way captain said miss fitz-
gerald when i was reading aloud to them i had
the strangest sensation as though some loving com-
forting power were folding me in its arms and it
seemed to emanate from the deelathon oh i know
it sounds foolish but i felt just as if my soul were
in a warm bath

  perhaps my chosen profession renders me less
susceptible to subconscious impression than you and
captain clinton said the astronomer neverthe-
less i must admit that i feel complete confidence in
these deelathon and their kindly intentions we
can only wait for the return of our friend toron at
sunset

  right i said rising and now miss fitz-
gerald and professor what do you say to lunch

chapter iii

the klendeela

throughout the long afternoon until the
sun approached and touched the narrow sea-
horizon visible in the gap to the west eager
eyes were incessantly turned to the crest of the
landward cliffs watching for the return of the
friendly deelathon

  suddenly there was a cry theyre coming and
a moment later we saw a crystal globe travelling
through the air just above the level of the plateau
it was much smaller than the one we had seen in
the ravine but it glittered with the same flux of
prismatic hues and was equipped with the same
equatorial band and polar bosses of reddish metal
which toron afterwards told us was an alloy of
gold copper and selenium

  for a few seconds the zeeth for this was the
name by which the deelathon called their strange
aerial vessels hovered motionless above the cliff-
edge and then with a suddenness which made me
gasp it shot out towards the ship with tremendous
velocity as though hurled from some invisible can-
non in less than ten seconds the zeeth was hover-
ing above the deck having come to a dead stop in its
headlong flight as suddenly as it had started then
it descended with infinite care until its suspended
cups rested on the after promenade deck where a
space was cleared by the passengers for its recep-
tion

  one of the crystal windows swung inward and
next moment toron stepped upon the deck followed
by the girl torona whom he had called his com-
panion

  they raised their hands in the deelathon greeting
and smiling at the amazed throng of men and women
with that peculiarly radiant smile which is so char-
the visitation



acteristic of all these people they cried zeloma
welcome

  now as you doubtless know benedict said cap-
tain clinton in the ages before the visitation the
people of the world and especially of the so-called
civilizedareas were governed in their actions not so
much by reason or intelligence as by custom it was
regarded as a sign of the most depraved savagery
to wear clothing for the purpose for which it was
designed namely warmth and people wore the most
extraordinary garments oftentimes hideously ugly
simply because they were as we used to say the
fashion early in the twentieth century there was
evident a healthy tendency to get away from this
bondage of fashion and return to the sensible use of
clothing for warmth alone but it proved to be sim-
ply another phase in the cycle of unreasoning cus-
tom and by the year  the pendulum had swung
to the other extreme with the result that people
were again loading themselves with unnecessary
garments as cumbersome and ugly as those of the
victorian era the natural outcome of this prac-
tice was an extraordinary attitude of false shame
with regard to the human body which is quite in-
comprehensible to us today nor was this modesty
without its basis in reason for the imperfections of
the average human body illustrated the meaning of
the old greek saying that it was forbidden to walk
the streets of athens naked not because it was inde-
cent but because it was ugly

  you will easily understand therefore that the
eight hundred or more passengers who had not pre-
viously seen the deelathon regarded our story of a
god-like people who wore no clothes with mingled
feelings of curiosity and disgust the ladies espe-
cially listened with raised eyebrows to miss fitz-
geralds enthusiastic descriptions of the physical
perfections of the deelathon

  having due regard to this state of mind i had
some doubt as to the sort of welcome which would
be accorded to the visitors

  my misgivings were soon dissipated no sooner
had the deelathon uttered their words of greeting
than old lady gibson mother of sir charles and
the very epitome of british respectability stepped
forward and slipping her arm around toronas
waist kissed her on both cheeks

  my dear you are very welcome to the shah of
iran and you too sir and the little old lady looked
up nodding and smiling into the radiant face of the
tall deelathon

   lady gibsons impulsive action broke the ice and
in a moment toron and torona were surrounded
with passengers vying with each other to do honor
to the beautiful visitors

   presently torona raised her head for silence

   my dear companion toroti she said has been
in consultation with the klendeela and he has a
message for you but first i want to thank you all
for your greeting you deela bana or as you would
say people of the sea are very strange to us with
your unhappy faces and your burden of clothes-
though perhaps that is why you are unhappy i am
sure it would make me so but i know we of the
deelathon must also seem strange to you and so we
thank you for your friendiness thevthon tells us
that great goodness is hidden behind your tired un-

happy faces and therefore i love you all and espe-
cially this fair maiden margaret whose book made
it possible for us to learn your language and she
threw her arm around miss fitzgerald and kissed
her

  they stood there side by side the american girl
and the deelathon maiden the passengers must
have been hard put to decide which was the fairer
for myself i had not a moment of doubt beautiful
as was torona with a beauty almost unearthly
margaret was more lovely in my eyes as you will
have guessed benedict margaret fitzgerald was
she who afterwards became your great-grandmother

nd then toron spoke

  friends he said torona my companion
has told you that you seem strange to us and this
is true for it is almost beyond belief that any beings
exist who know not the thon i have been in consul-
tation with the klendeela which is our council and
this is the message they have sent to you the klen-
deela understands that you are imprisoned by the
barrier reef which sank and rose during the earth- 
quake since your zeeth-which-floats-on-the-sea will
not float in the air like our zeeths we want to tell
you that with the greatest of our zeeths we can
raise your vessel into the air and transport it across
the reef at any time you desire the klendeela
thinks however that you should not leave us until
we have entertained you and if the thon permits
made known to you the meaning of that thon which
seems so mysterious to you to this end they have
commanded me to ask some few of you to return
with me smithton and you clinton and the maiden
with the book and her brother and some few others
whom you may select

  you bring us good news toron i replied and
we accept the invitation of your council at least
the others will doubtless do so but as for me i am
in command here and it is not our custom for the
captain to leave his ship for any length of time

  toron nodded his understanding and then en-
gaged in a brief discussion with torona at last
he addressed me again

  we understand and honor your custom clinton
and are prepared to overcome the difficulty in the
morning i will return with ouf greatest zeeth and
will transport your ship above the cliffs to a lake
which is in the midst of our houses there you can
remain as long as seems fit to you visiting us at
your pleasure and returning to your ship each night
when you desire to leave us we will lift your ship
into the sea and you can return whence you came

  the idea of lifting thirty thousand tons of steel
plates and girders bodily into the air might well
have caused more than a qualm of doubt in our
minds but such was the complete confidence with
which the deelathon inspired us that i assented to
this amazing proposal without hesitation the tre-
mendous speed of which the zeeth was capable and
the perfect control with which it was handled re-
moved all doubt that we might have felt of the abil-
ity of the deelathon to carry out this titanic engi-
neering feat

  having arranged the time at which they would
return in the morning toron and torona saluted us
and entered their zeeth which rose from the deck


amazing stories

and travelling in a tremendous parabola disap-
peared behind the black columns of basalt -

  there was little sleep that night for any one the
insomnia was produced not at all by alarm at the
prospects of the morrow but by the fact that every-
one was speculating on the meaning of these strange
events all felt that we stood on the brink of some
great adventure which was to have a permanent ef-
fect upon our lives that the deelathon meant us
anything but good never entered our minds as
lady gibson remarked to margaret

  my dear when that glorious creature toron
looked at me i felt as though i must tell the truth
if i had told even the tiniest white lie i should
have jumped in the sea and drowned myself to hide
my shame

  next morning every passenger and member of
the crew was on deck early at the appointed time
the zeeth soared into view and accustomed as we
were becoming to marvels the size of this tremen-
dous sphere staggered us it measured fully three
thousand feet around the equator and from either
pole hung huge cables of the same reddish metal
that was used universally among the deelathon for
engineering purposes

  when the zeeth was hovering above the shah i
ordered the anchors to be hauled in and we floated
free the zeeth sank slowly until the inverted
cups which terminated the cables hung suspended
level with the mastheads

  i had anticipated that it would be necessary to
spend several days rigging steel cables under the
shah in order to provide a cradle to support the
immense weight of the vessel i had mentioned
this to toron the previous day but he had smiled
and assured me that no preparations were neces-
sary

  the great globe hung poised in the air above the
ship and then a most amazing thing happened a
slight tremor passed through the vessel and it be-
gan to rise slowly towards those inverted cups
inch by inch rose the great liner the water cascad-
ing from her bottom plates until the keel was clear
of the surface and we hung in mid-air supported
by some invisible force

  the cups from which this force apparently em-
anated were still separated from the deck by fully
a hundred feet and yet the shah hung securely
on a level keel so that in the saloon where dinner
had been laid not even a drop of water was spilled
from the filled glasses

  slowly we rose until we hung above the level
of the cliffs and then the zeeth with its enormous
burden began to move towards the land

as soon as we became accustomed to our strange
situation the rails were crowded with a
throng eager to catch a first glimpse of the new
land we beheld a rolling park-like country dotted
here and there with groups of palms and other
trees in the far distance we could faintly discern
another wall of black cliffs and beyond them rose
range on range of snow-capped peaks which we
rightly supposed were the mighty andes a wide
river like a silver ribbon wound its way from the
distant snow fields in the centre of the level area
which might have been fifty miles in diameter the

river broadened into a gleaming lake and then con-
tinued on its placid way amplified by numerous
tributaries until it plunged over the cliffs into
the pit of the shining pool

  as we drew nearer we caught sight of innumer-
able buildings net crowded together into towns
but scattered among the groves of trees these
buildings which were of every imaginable size
were all of the same general design consisting of
an ellipsoidal roof of the same glassy crystal of
which the zeeth was constructed supported on a
circular colonnade of marble pillars hundreds of
zeeths of all sizes darted here and there through
the air and as their occupants caught sight of us
flocked towards us and followed our course until
we seemed to move in a cloud of fairy bubbles

  many of the houses were built on the top of the
basaltic columns bordering the river and we could
see groups of the deelathon standing or sitting on
the verge of the cliff watching our progress with
absorbed interest

  as we drew nearer to the lake we observed
standing on a slight elevation a very large build-
ing which we rightly took to be the meeting place
of the klendeela or council this was built on the
same circular plan as the dwellings but was of
vastly greater size

  at last the shah of iran hung above the centre
of the lake and the zeeth gradually sank until the
shah was resting once more in her native element

  that afternoon a small zeeth shot out from the
shore and landed on the deck it contained our
friends toron and torona bringing with them a
splendid deelathon whom  toron introduced to us
as rethmar the head of the klendeela

  the klendeela is assembled and would be hon-
ored by your presence said toron you clinton
and the wise man smithton and the fair maiden
margaret and her brother fred

  we answer the summons of the klendeela gladly
toron i said because we fully trust you and
are anxious to learn more of your country

  that wish shall be granted replied toron in
the meantime while you are in consultation with
the klendeela many of our people will come to your
ship in pleasure zeeths and take as many of your
friends as care to go to their homes for all the
deelathon are delighted to offer hospitality to our
visitors from the sea

  torona explained that we were to cross the lake
in their zeeth and land on the farther shore from
which point we would walk to the assembly hall
in order that we might have an opportunity to see
some of the country on our way

  rethmar reentered the zeeth beckoning me with
a smile to follow him i approached the circular
opening not without trepidation but i was hardly
prepared for what took place i set my foot on the
edge of the door while rethmar extended a hand
to help me next instant i seemed to be falling
all sense of material existence vanished and in a
whirl of confusion i seemed to be floating in
space then i felt the reassuring clasp of reth-
mars hand and gradually i regained my composure
only to find to my astonishment that instead of
resting on the bottom of the zeeth i was actually
the visitation



poised in space at the centre of the globe without
visible means of support

  then rethmar drew me to the side and slipping
a broad flexible belt around my waist fastened it
with a catch of some sort

  i now perceived that there was one of these belts
midway between each of the crystal windows at-
tached to the metal band which encircled the
equator

  and now another surprise awaited me al-
though the zeeth was made of some crystal when
viewed from without the globe was quite opaque
so that it was impossible to see the occupants
when viewed from the interior however the glassy
material was so perfectly transparent that it sim-
ply seemed non-existent and one was conscious only
of the equatorial band and polar bosses apparently
suspended in air without support

  rethmar having observed the state of mental
aberration which possessed me upon my first entry
floated across the zeeth to the open window and
spoke to toron in his own tongue and i heard
toron warning the others not to be alarmed

  professor smithton was the next and i could
hardly forbear laughing as the somewhat corpulent
form of the astronomer floated lightly upwards
under the guidance of rethmar who coolly passed
one of the belts around the professor leaving him
suspended horizontally above my head

  why good heavens captain sputtered the
professor wonders upon wonders do you real-
ize what our extraordinary sensations indicate

  no i cant say that i do except that i feel as
though i were having a nightmare and cant wake
up

txell well well ejaculated the professor

  w these people are a thousand years ahead
of us in science as well as in mental development
they have overcome gravitation this transparent
substance of which the globe is composed is opaque
to gravitation with the result that it not only has
no weight but nothing within it-ourselves for
example-has any weight either marvellous

  now the others entered the zeeth each of my
shipmates expressing wonder at the unexpected sen-
sation of floating in mid-air when we were all
secured in place by the equatorial straps toron
and torona stepped into the zeeth the girl sailed
lightly across the globe and slipped one of the belts
around her but toron remained floating in the air
and closed the crystal window behind him

  i began to look around for some machinery by
which the zeeth could be moved but could see noth-
ing except a small handle in the centre of each win-
dow toron began to turn these handles propelling
himself from one to another by slight touches
against the walls of the globe and i perceived that
the handles were connected to the long needles which
projected from the centre of the windows

  there was a slight shock and i looked downward
the deck of the shah of iran was falling away with
tremendous speed and the country opened out until
we could see for many miles in every direction
toron manipulated some more of the handles and
the zeeth began to move rapidly towards the shore

  now of course we were all accustomed to riding

on the old-fashioned airplanes which had been
brought to great perfection during the second quar-
ter of the twentieth century but the sensation was
no more comparable to that of riding in a zeeth
than falling downstairs is to be compared to sliding
down a snow slope on skis there was no roar or
vibration of machinery simply swift effortless mo-
tion and the absolute transparency of the globe
and our own lack of weight added to the illusion
that we were flying through space at our own voli-
tion

  as we flew towards the great building which we
had seen that morning toron said

  i heard your remark smithton and you are
quite right in your explanation of the cause for
the zeeths lack of weight the globe is composed
of elathongar an artificial crystal which as you
say is opaque to gravitation

  ah quite so said the professor but i still
fail to understand what force propels the zeeth
since opacity to gravitation would simply cause it
to rise upward from the earths surface

  the propelling force is contained or rather pro-
duced by the rods attached to these handles they
are acted upon by the thon replied toron and
by turning them on their axes the force is up
down or in either direction as we wish

  the thon again exclaimed the professor
what is this thon toron

  the deelathon smiled gravely that i am not
permitted to tell you-yet he replied

  now we sank gently to a landing on a grassy
plain near the shore of the lake we alighted and
headed by rethmar started up a winding path at
first we were hampered by the sudden transition
in weight from nothing to one hundred and sixty
pounds or thereabouts but the novelty soon wore
off and we looked about us

  everywhere we saw the simple and yet beautiful
dwellings of the deelathon and everywhere we saw
the same ellipsoidal roof of elathongar supported
by pillars of stone later during our stay iij this
strange land we received and accepted many invi-
tations to visit the homes of the deelathon and we
discovered that both floors and roof were universal-
ly made of this gravity-shielding crystal thus re-
ducing the effort required to accomplish any work
to a minimum

  the force of gravity could be adjusted to any
degree desired by means of a sliding panel arrange-
ment but during our social calls these were gen-
erally kept closed so that we simply reclined in the
air and talked some of the passengers spent the
night in the deelathon houses and after the perfect
relaxation of literally sleeping upon air found
difficulty in sleeping at all on an ordinary bed

presently we entered a great avenue of
stately palms at the end of which gleamed the
white pillars of the assembly hall guided by
rethmar we walked up a noble stairway flanked
by mighty columns and stood in the centre of a
splendid amphitheatre surrounded by rows and
rows of marble seats or couches as we entered we
were again conscious of loss of weight so that we
seemed to float rather than walk across the crystal
pavement


amazing stories

  hundreds of deelathon both men and women
reclined on the seats but as we entered they all
rose to their feet there was a rustling sound and
a ripple of colored light as their thonmeleks flashed
erect upon their heads their hands rose in the
deelathon salute and there was a unanimous shout
of

  zeloma deelarana

  rethmar led us to seats at one side of the huge
auditorium and then floated to the centre and ad-
dressed the assemblage in his own language when
he resumed his seat toron rose and began to speak
in english

  friends from across the sea he said the klen-
deela has asked me to speak for them because i
alone can talk your language freely thanks to the
maiden margaret we have brought you here out
of no idle curiosity or merely to offer you our
hearty welcome but because we believe it lies in
our power to do you great good not alone to you
and those with you but also to the countless mil-
lions like you who as you tell us inhabit the world
to us unknown

  but before offering you this priceless gift
known to us as the thon the klendeela requests
you to tell us more of that world in which you live
tell us of its history its present conditions its sci-
ence and its religion thus will the klendeela be
able to judge if we are right in revealing to you
the secret of the thon

  fear not to speak in your own tongue for all
will understand you fear only to say that which
is epthona or false for we shall know the thona
from the epthona

  professor smithton who had at my urgent re-
quest agreed to act as spokesman for our party
rose to his feet and steadying himself for a mo-
ment against his tendency to rise above the floor
said

  men of the deelathon the feeling of confidence
with which you inspired us at our first meeting is
made stronger by your welcome and your offer we
do not know what this gift of the thon may por-
tend but we are agreed that if your self-evident
health and happiness are due in any way to this
thon we greatly desire to share the secret with
you

  we will willingly describe to you the world in
which we live but to do this completely it would
be necessary to combine the knowledge of many
minds among the passengers and crew of our
ship are persons from every walk of life i sug-
gest that you allow us to select some of these per-
sons to deal with the various phases of the subject

  your excellent suggestion shall be carried out
replied toron after a moments consultation with
rethmar return now to your ship and make all
necessary arrangements with your friends each
morning the klendeela will assemble to hear your
speakers each afternoon we of the deelathon will
welcome you to our homes or show you the beauties
of our country on foot or in our zeeths

  before we retire said the professor is it
permitted to ask one question

  any question will be answered freely smith-
ton replied toron so long as it does not relate
to the thon

  i wish to know said the professor why with
your zeeths incomparably superior to our finest
means of transportation you have not long ago vis-
ited this outer world in which we live

  there are reasons which i cannot explain to you
now said toron indeed we do not fully under-
stand them ourselves this however i can tell
you the power of the crystal we call elathongar
is in some way associated with the black rock that
underlies our country when we attempt to pass
far beyond this rock our zeeths sink to the
ground neither is it possible for us to leave
our country on foot for we are hemmed in on one
side by the sea and on the other by several rows
of unclimbable cliffs

  toron escorted us back to the ship and left us
i called the passengers together and having told
them of our meeting with the klendeela asked for
volunteers to give the strangest course of lectures
that has ever been delivered

next morning and day by day for a week we
crossed the lake to the assembly hall where
the klendeela gathered to listen in a silence un-
broken save by the voice of the lecturer and the
rustling of those strange rainbow-tinted frills
which seemed to respond to every emotion of the
hearers

  dr malone of yale spoke on ancient history and
dr calthorp of harvard on modern history and
social conditions professor smithton lectured on
pure science and fred fitzgerald on applied sci-
ence and mechanics dr ronald the ships sur-
geon gave an outline of medicine and i spoke brief-
ly on navigation general thornton of the u s
army described the development of war from the
days of the sword and crossbow to its present state
of perfection dr maxwell of leland stanford
spoke on psychology and bishop brander of wash-
ington lectured on comparative religion

  thus the days passed while those god-like crea-
tures  listened with absorbed attention to all we
had got over the wonder of their being able to un-
derstand us we had become accustomed to the
strange sensations incident to the use of the gravi-
tation shields but our amazement at the beauty
and health and radiant happiness of these marvel-
lous beings remained unabated could carlyle
have seen the klendeela before writing his sartor
resartus he would have hesitated before ridiculing
the picture of a parliament without clothes

  once only was there any interruption to the
steady flow of words it was during the latter part
of professor smithtons lecture on physics he was
explaining some of the more recent discoveries of
the scientists when there was a rustle of thon-
meleks a flash of color and the members of the
klendeela leaped to their feet amid a babble of
voices in the confusion we could hear the word
thon again and again the excitement sub-
sided as quickly as it had arisen and after a few
words of apology from rethmar the professor pro-
ceeded with his discourse

  margaret fitzgerald and i spent all the after-

  during the year of the visitation this difficulty was
overcome and zeeths now travel over every part of the
world
the visitation



noon with toron and torona sometimes reclining
in their zeeth and watching the glorious landscape
unfolding below us sometimes wandering through
groves of cinnamon and nutmeg trees sometimes
resting in the crystal dwelling of our deelathon
friends

  toron talked freely on all subjects and willingly
told us everything we asked relating to the social
and economic life of the people one subject alone
he avoided and that the thing we most desired to
know-the nature and meaning of the thon

  we were amazed at the perfection of the deela-
thon government and their commercial arrange-
ments but we were astounded at the extreme sim-
plicity of the social machinery by which all their
activities were controlled early in our friendship
i asked toron if we were correct in supposing that
torona was his wife toron looked puzzled for
an instant and then replied

  yes and no clinton when i first met you i
selected the word companion as better suited to
explain our relationship than wife i feel a mean-
ing in your word which is entirely foreign to our
word

  but torona is not related to you toron i
asked

  no except as my companion

  you have chosen each other as mates i asked
yes he replied placing his hand gently on
toronas

  then surely i went on you have been united
by some ceremony such as that which we call mar-
riage

  no that is the difference exclaimed toron
we have no ceremonies of any kind what you
call a ceremony is a form of words designed to
make the listeners believe a falsehood or else to
impress upon them something they are not sure of
therefore of course we need no ceremonies

  i did not quite see where the of course came
in but i let that go and followed another line of
thought

  then there is nothing to prevent you from sep-
arating from your companions as you call them
at any time

  nothing at all replied toron smiling radiantly
at torona

  then divorce must be exceedingly common
among you toron- said

  toron and torona both burst out laughing

  as common as it is for the rose to divorce it-
self voluntarily from the tree said torona or
the silver pathway on the lake to divorce itself
from the moon

  toron laughed again at the blank expression on
our faces and said

  dont you see clinton and you margaret that
all your ceremonies and divorces are necessary be-
cause you are not sure of yourselves we deela-
thon never make a mistake in our choice of a com-
panion in fact as you will learn later it is im-
possible for us to make a mistake therefore
when we choose a companion it is forever
another time as we were hovering over the
wooded country in toronas little zeeth margaret
commented on the curious fact that we had never
seen any sign of burial grounds nor indeed had we

so much as heard the word death mentioned

  again toron looked puzzled and then as was his
custom replied by asking a seemingly irrelevant
question

  how old are you clinton

  thirty-six i answered

  years was torons curious question

  of course i replied

  i understand margarets question now said
toron his face bearing an expression as near sad-
ness as it ever could friends does it surprise
you that i toron have seen over eight hundred
summers and torona over six hundred and fifty

 surely you jest toron i exclaimed no
man can ever live to such an age

  and why not asked toron

  because-oh because its contrary to nature
sickness and old age sap the wells of life and death
comes generally before a hundred years have
passed

 and we wondered at their unhappy faces
toron exclaimed torona why margaret there
are many among the deelathon who have lived not
eight hundred but eight thousand years we know
what you mean by sickness but no such thing ex-
ists among us neither have we anything which
corresponds to your idea of old age true we
leave our bodies not because they are worn out but
because our appointed time has come oh friend
how can you do more than just taste the cup of life
in so brief a space of time as one century

and then came the afternoon when we were
summoned to meet the klendeela for the last
time our speakers had concluded their addresses
and professor smithton summed up their lectures
in an eloquent speech in which he extolled the
glories of the civilization of which we were the rep-
resentatives

  for a brief interval there was silence and then
rethmar rose

  friends accept the thanks of the klendeela for
your kindness we have decided that the gift of
the thon shall be extended to you and through you
to all the world tomorrow if it shall please you
we will take you and all your company both men
and women to the thontara and there in the pres-
ence of that undying wonder we will reveal to you
the secret of the thon which makes us what we
are

chapter iv

the glory of the thontara

i need not tell you in detail benedict with
what excitement we awaited the coming of the
day upon which we were at last to learn the
meaning of the mysterious thon everyone on the
shah of iran had come to love and admire these
strange people with their gentle courteous ways
their radiant happy faces their wonderful health
and almost divine beauty

  the sun rose in a clear sky for the first time for
a week as though to celebrate the beginning of a
new iera for mankind hundreds of zeeths soared
up from among the trees on the lake-shore and
hovered over the steamer one by one they dropped


amazing stories

to the deck and rose again with their quota of
passengers

  at last the ship was deserted and the fleet of
crystal spheres swooped away seaward to land
upon a grassy plain near the brink of the great
waterfall rethmar led the way to the edge of the
cliffs at the point where the river gathered itself
for the final plunge and then we perceived a flight
of steps cut in the solid rock

  we started down each man or woman escorted
by a friendly deelathon a company of over two
thousand rethmar and the professor went first
then margaret and torona followed by myself ac-
companied by toron as my turn came and i ap-
proached the top of the steps i noticed that they
did not terminate at the edge of the river but en-
tered instead a hole in the rocks directly under the
fall i should have hesitated but i caught sight or
margaret disappearing into the gloom and plucked
up my courage to proceed

  a moment later i stood on a small platform on
my left was the cliff on my right and so close
that i could have touched it was a descending wall
of water thundering into the abyss

  the other four had disappeared and i looked
questioningly at toron for answer he took my
hand and led me forward to the edge of the plat-
form and then i realized with a thrill of horror
that we stood on the top of one of the basalt col-
umns and that the flight of steps continued spirally
down it being carved out of the solid rock there
was no railing of any kind and the idea of walk-
ing down that fearsome stairway with nothing but
space and darkness below me and with millions of
tons of water rushing by turned me sick

   glanced again at toron and met his smile of
encouragement my fears departed and with his
hand in mine we started down round and round
we circled now passing close to the wall of water
whose roar grew ever louder as we descended now
passing through little tunnels which had been cut
between the pillar and the cliff looking up i could
see a seemingly endless line of figures circling the
mighty column and looking for all the world like
the processionary caterpillars on the trunk of a
pine tree and once when i glanced hurriedly down-
ward i caught a glimpse of margarets dark hair
and the gleam of toronas pink body in the gloom

  at last with a sigh of relief i stepped from the
bottom of the column to the floor of a great cave
like the famous cave of the winds under niagara
falls margaret and the professor with the two
deelathon men were awaiting us and we stood
watching that silent line of figures creeping slowly
downward until we were once more united in the
great cavity under the waterfall

  i thought our ordeal was over and that this must
be the thontara of which rethmar had spoken i
was wondering how it would be possible for him to
reveal any secret to us in a place where the bellow
of the waters would drown any attempt at speech
but as the thought entered my mind i saw rethmar
drawing the professor forward and they began to
descend another flight of steps cut like the other
in the solid rock

  following margaret and torona i found that
this stairway ran sharply down into a tunnel which

seemed to lead us directly under the fall the pas-
sage was so low that i could touch the roof with
my hand and feel the living rock trembling with
the tremendous impact of the water

  still we descended and i saw a faint flicker of
light below me growing ever brighter and brighter
a hundred more steps brought us to the bottom
and passing through an arched opening we stood at
last in the thontara

  at the glory of the sight that met my eyes i ut-
tered an involuntary cry of amazement and delight
we stood on the edge of a great circular depres-
sion which i judged to be about a thousand feet
in diameter surrounding this depression was the
broad shelf of black basalt on which we were stand-
ing and filling the entire area within this shelf
was a mass of colored light which surged and rip-
pled like a sea of rainbows i have spoken of the
varied hues which were visible on the surface of
the crystal zeeths this was the same but intensi-
fied a thousand-fold

  as my eyes became accustomed to the light i
realized that we were standing on the border of a
vast circular floor of crystal so exquisitely trans-
parent that it was like gazing into a bottomless pit
of lucent flame it was long before i could turn
my eyes from that sea of fire and look upward but
when at last i did so i was greeted by a new
wonder

  -- v

was looking at the under side of the great
dome of water which occupied the centre of the
pool below the waterfall this living roof of
liquid seeming as frail as a bubble and yet weigh-
ing under normal conditions no one knows how
many thousand tons was bereft of its weight by
the screening effect of the crystal and hung in mid-
air motionless and yet in constant motion under
the tremendous force of the cataract its under sur-
face reflecting as though in a mirror the splendor
of the sea of colored light below

  while i had been absorbing the beauty of this
natural kaleidoscope the rocky shelf had been filling
with our great company until we were all assembled
in the thontara rethmar and the professor had
gone to the farther side and i saw the deelathon
raise his hand in salute and prepare to speak

  the roar of the waterfall was almost inaudible
and was replaced by a soft hissing produced by
the rapid movement of the liquid roof as reth-
mar began to speak his voice penetrated to every
corner of the immense space reflected from the
dome by some strange acoustic effect like that some-
times heard in old cathedrals

  friends from beyond the sea he said we have
brought you to this place which we call the thon-
tara because it seemed the most fitting spot in
which to reveal to you the secret of the thon you
cannot have failed to understand that this thon
which is so mysterious to you is regarded by us as
the greatest gift in the possession of man our
language alone would reveal this to you we call
ourselves the deelathon people of the thon this
living frill upon our heads is the thonmelek mir-
ror of the thon and this glory that you behold
js the thontara place of the thon now there-
the visitation	

fore before revealing to you the meaning of this
word we ask you to tell us what you have guessed
the thon to be

  truly we have wondered rethmar said the
professor some thought it was the god you wor-
ship miss fitzgerald imagined that it stood for
intuition and i guessed it might be truth

  in a measure you are all right said rethmar
and yet you have but touched on the fringe of the
matter listen and i will reveal to you all the
secret of this mystery the thon is the power of
life it is the essence which separates the living
from the dead the animate from the inanimate
the man from the animal and the plant from the
stone through the thon we the deelathon are
what we are

  we hear your words and they are good reth-
mar said the professor but we do not yet under-
stand how the thon can benefit us

  listen again said rethmar you have told
us of the outer world in which you live and we are
grieved at your story you claim credit for the
conquest of nature but it is nature which has con-
quered you you boast of the perfection of your
civilization but you are the slaves of that civiliza-
tion you have created there is hardly anything
in science which you have told us that we have not
known for centuries but we use our knowledge in-
stead of permitting our knowledge to use us in
spite of your fancied attainments you are in bond-
age to three masters sorrow sickness and death
and yet the key to unlock your bonds is all around
you nay more you smithton have told us that
you have known the thon for forty years and have
not recognized it for what it is

  i exclaimed the professor i told you that 
you told us repeated rethmar at the third
meeting of the klendeela that forty years ago one
of your wise men discovered a power that pene-
trated the densest metals a power of which he
could not discover the origin a power which he
called the cosmic ray t this friends is the
thon

  make no mistake he went on we do not wor-
ship the thon one of you has told us how in an-
cient times men worshipped the sun the source
of light but we worship the one god whom no
man may know as for the thon we know not
whence it comes we only know it fills all space and
permeates all things we know that it is a form
of wave motion like light but whereas light is re-
flected by material things the thon is reflected by
the mind and spirit of all that lives therefore i
have called it the power of life

  you have spoken with pride of your elaborate
system of laws your multiplex religions your so-
cial ceremonials your great battles in which mil-
lions grapple to the death friends are you so
blind that you cannot see that all these things are
bred of misunderstanding misunderstanding of
yourselves of each other of the living universe of
which you are a part can you conceive of fight-
ing those you call your enemies if each side could
see the others viewpoint as clearly as his own

  dr robert a milliken

t have said that the thon is a form of vibra-
-l tion which responds to the life-form or spirit
of living things by virtue of the thon one mind
beholds another just as the material eye beholds
other material bodies by virtue of reflected light
thus it is that misunderstanding is impossible
among us thus it is that we are able to under-
stand you when you speak your own language
thus it is that we need no such laws and ceremonies
and social machinery as that of which you boast
and thus it is that we enjoy perfect health and
happiness because we see not only the outer shell
 as you do but also the living mind that resides
within the shell as you would say

  but tell us rethmar said the professor if
you thus see the mind within the body why is
speech necessary since your thoughts must be vis-
ible to one another 

  first let me say smithton that the mind is
not within the body but the body within the mind
as to your question it is a reasonable one and we
ourselves do not fully understand why it is not as
you say it seems however that the spoken word
is necessary as the vehicle of thought with us as
with you but note the difference when you
speak your thought must go through many trans-
lations before reaching the mind of the hearer los-
ing some of its sense with each translation first
you must mentally select the words best fitted to
express your idea then your organs of speech
must convert those words into vibrations of sound
which in turn must act upon the ears of your hearer
and be turned into the nerve-force which reacts
upon the brain here the word-sounds must be
converted into word-pictures

   is it any wonder that the thought of the speaker
reaches the brain of the listener in a mangled con-
dition and it matters not whether the words be
true or false the hearer cannot distinguish between
them but with us the spoken word is simply the
means by which the speaker reveals his thought to
the hearer no matter how imperfectly the words
may have been selected the hearer sees by the re-
flected rays of the thon the actual thought of the
speaker i use the word sees but of course we
do not see the thon with the eye but with an in-
tangible organ of the mind

  it comes to us as a great surprise said the
professor that the thon of which we have heard
so much should be the medium of a sixth sense and
should be none other than the cosmic ray with
which we are familiar we can easily realize that
a people who live under such conditions must be
the happiest people in the world but when you
offer us the gift of the thon rethmar you seem
to forget that we lack this special faculty which
enables you to visualize the mental images produced
by the thon you may tell a blind man of the
light but you cannot make him see

  oh smithton smithton do you still fail to
understand said rethmar and his voice rang out
like a bugle call to every one of the great circle of
listeners this special faculty as you call it is not
the exclusive possession of the deelathon it is
common to all mankind it is a part of every liv-
ing thing it is inherent in life itself oh
friends from beyond the sea you are not by nature


amazing stories

blind to the thon for countless generations you
and all your race have lived and died like men
who bandage their eyes that they may not see the
light

  for the last time listen

  and then in words so simple that the humblest
trimmer among the crew could understand reth-
mar revealed to us the secret which gave us full
possession of that marvellous sixth sense the con-
sciousness of the thon

  you benedict and all your generation were
born with this sense fully developed and you can
hardly realize what stupendous emotions convulsed
us when to use rethmars simile the bandages
were torn from the eyes of our minds and we saw
ourselves and our friends and all living things
face to face in the light of the thon to you your
consciousness of the thon is as natural and com-
monplace as your consciousness of light or sound
but to us it came as an overpowering revelation

  speaking for myself for a space my mind was
dazzled as the eyes of a blind man are dazzled when
he first receives his sight when this temporary
confusion passed my first thought was of margaret
fitzgerald

  we had been drawn together in friendship dur-
ing our strange adventures i had thought her
beautiful and womanly but no word of love had
passed my lips now as her eyes met mine i saw
revealed a beauty of spirit and intellect such as i
scarcely dreamed could exist her face was radiant
with happiness but her soul was calm with the peace
of eternity

  no word was spoken no word was needed the
revealing rays of the thon told us beyond thq pos-
sibility of misunderstanding that we were com-
panions a moment later our arms were around
each other and in the presence of that great com-
pany we gave and received our first kiss

  and in the light of the thon we realized the
literal truth of the poets words

our spirits rushed together

at the meeting of the lips

there is little more to be told with her hand
in mine i led margaret across the great crys-
tal floor walking as though in a sea of prismatic
flame to where rethmar stood

  rethmar and toron men and women of the
deelathon i said margaret my dear compan-
ion and i thank you in the name of all this com-
pany for your great gift now we ask a further
favor knowing that it will be granted that we may
go back into our world and teach our unhappy fel-
low men to see i even venture to beg that some
few of your people will accompany us to lighten our
task for none can fail to understand the meaning
of the thon when the secret is revealed by a deela-
thon

  rethmars face was but a faint reflection of the
radiance of his spirit raising his hand in the
deelathon salute he cried

  you have heard the request of our friends clin-
ton and margaret now companions by the thon
who will go with them

  and a thousand arms flashed up in the salute

and a thousand voices rang out in the words now
as intelligible to us as english

  zo thana-i will go

  all cannot go said rethmar toron and to-
rona shall with a company of one hundred go
with you on your ship one thing alone we ask
that the place of the deelathon shall remain a secret
until you are sure that no harm shall come to our
country you have a saying that it is foolish to
cast pearls before swine who knows what might
happen when the thon is revealed to all men

  and there in the pulsing splendor of the thon-
tara we the passengers and crew of the shah of
iran swore the oath of secrecy which we have kept
to this hour

  three days later the great liner was lifted from
the lake to the blue waters of the pacific outside
the barrier reef a whirling cloud of zeeths hov-
ered and darted above us as our screws began to
churn the water the equatorial windows were
crowded with deelathon waving a last salute to
the brave hundred upon our decks who alas were
destined never to return

  presently we passed the boundaries of the basalt
rock and the zeeths were forced to turn back hav-
ing reached what was then the limit of their range
our course was laid to the north and a pathway
of foam fled in our wake as we commenced the last
voyage which was to bring happiness and health
and understanding to the world-the voyage of
the visitation

afterword

  the sun was high in the heavens when captain
clinton concluded his narrative we rose from our
seat on the bare summit of the shah and without
a word began our descent

  and now i benedict clinton have completed the
task assigned to me by my great-grandfather a
year ago the story of the year of the visitation
is known to all the world even if its effects were
not visible on every side today

  and yet a visitor from another planet could
hardly have blamed the deelathon for their caution
lest the gift of the thon should bring about a revo-
lution which would convulse the world and over-
whelm their tiny country in its flood

  actually nothing in the nature of a revolution
took place the new order was so entirely natural
so utterly sane that the change took place every-
where almost without our being aware of it

  there was no wholesale abolition of laws and gov-
ernments we simply ceased to use them as men
discard a worn-out garment there was no delib-
erate disarmament nations ceased to go to war
because there were no nations any longer cruisers
and battleships armored cars and guns lay rotting
and rusting where they had been abandoned in
the light of the new understanding racial and na-
tional divisions ceased to have any meaning al-
though we have retained many of the geographical
names for the sake of convenience

  people everywhere found a marvellous increase
in health and happiness as the direct result of the
knowledge of sane living which was revealed by
the thon but the seed of death was in them and
they the epzykofs are passing away from among
the visitation



us year by year not so with the generations yet
unborn at the date of the visitation we the
zykofs enjoy the same perfection of bodily and
mental well-being that my great-grandfather found
among the deelathon and we know of no limit to
our lives save the call of destiny

  and what of toron and torona and the hundred
whom they led to our deliverance they came forth
voluntarily from a country of undying beauty to
bring the greatest of all natural gifts to the world
and in so doing perished utterly unfitted physi-
cally to cope with the misery and disease and death

which they came to eradicate they faded sickened
and died in the accomplishment of their great task
before the year had passed away not one of that
splendid band was left

farout in the pacific is a barren island of mag-
netic iron oxide the remnant of the great
meteor and above its highest point towers a mighty
spire of imperishable crystal its prismatic efflor-
escence is visible at night for many miles and upon
its base is the inscription

to the visitants

 by geo r fox

dhen i set out to record this historical
event in which i had some part i al-
most overlooked my scrap-books oh i
admit that the possession of a scrap-
book in this age when time and need
for such compilation no longer exists marks the
possessor as hopelessly passi but i no longer
make them with the exception of three items
clipped this year  my scrap-books were filled
before i was twenty years of age as i now am
in my one hundred and twentieth year it is plainly
evident that one hundred years have passed since i
pasted the last clipping

  my first scrap-book was begun through the in-
fluence of my grandfather while i was but a lad
he made me familiar with the same type of book
kept by his father jedidiah prindle who was one
of the pioneers in the then new state of wisconsin
settling in the wilderness of the fox river valley
in 

  to grandfather prindle his fathers book meas-
uring as it did events in a past which grandfather
had come to look upon as a golden age was treas-
ure and i saw it with his eyes in emulation i
cut and pasted purposeless then invaluable now

  when my friend editor jernseck alone among
publishers threw open to my story the platform of
his visualaud magazine

i was elated yet worried

  jernseck i told him

my tale is almost incred-
ible and worse yet cor-
roborative e v id e n c e is
lacking

  randall prindle i be-
lieve you he rejoined
with quiet emphasis

even did i doubt still 

never shall it be said that	--

this great magazine

founded by my grandfather shall be closed to scien-
tific statements though actual proof is lacking if
that statement is in accord with the scientific knowl-
edge of the day and is capable of being considered
a probability rather than a possibility

  after this expression of confidence i racked my
mind for proofs almost hopeless i was about to
give up when from the depths of my memory i
dragged the thought of my scrap-books verifica-
tion -there i found it or at least references from
the news columns and scientific journals of those

 rvhe second prise-winning story was selected chiefly
 because of the excellent science contained in it and
 the plausible manner in which the entire story is devel-
 oped the plot in this story is excellent and as we have
 said elsewhere you will be surprised to see that you
 can read all seven prise-winning stories and enjoy them
 although you might at first think that there would neces-
 sarily be much duplication in the several plots this
 however you will speedily discover is not so

years that point the truth of the beginning of my
story i can vindicate jernsecks faith in my
credibility

   the first clipping goes back to  this i
mounted some years after it was printed of sev-
eral covering the same subject this from my scrap-
book is from the magazine of science official pub-
lication of the american society of scientific prog-
ress the weight of this organization is behind its
utterances

are we going to have a new moon
dr baades discovery calls attention
to our second moon

     washington d c jan  -dr baade
   of hamburg university reported on october
    that in the constellation pegasus he had
   seen a new object of the tenth magnitude and
   planetary in aspect but travelling at terrific
   speed

     yerkes observatory photographed the body
   prof frost says it is invisible to the naked eye 
   as is the miniature moon suspected of accom-
   panying the earth astronomers likewise have
   yet to catch a first glimpse of it they estimate
   its speed at three and a half miles a second
   and think it has a diameter of about  feet

will the earth capture
hmhsbbsbss dr baades heavenly

body as it did the minor
moon scientists be-
lieve it will pass us so
closely that it will be
deflected from its origi-
nal path and become our
third satellite

 this word is compounded from visual and auditory

other clippings mostly

hbhhb from newspapers made

                       light of the discovery
after a few months it dropped out of public atten-
tion why if the body was captured did no one
find it later and why if it came as close as pre-
dicted did not the camera pick it up or catch a
glimpse of the supposed second moon probably
the story i have dug out of my old scrap-book is not
today remembered or known to a single living per-
son outside myself  yet this has a bearing on my
narrative

the second clipping to be quoted does not oome
from my scrap-book with the book as a guide i
dug up three items from the files of the chicago


amazing stories

union these appeared in the three issues just pre-
ceding its seizure by the government the union
and the labor unions back of it were firm believers
in peace and bitterly opposed the use of war to
settle disputes between nations at the breaking
out of the second world war the paper openly op-
posed the governments policy and counselled re-
sistance to the draft because of the vast numbers
behind the union the powers at washington
thought it wise to ignore this but when the paper
openly published the loss of the woodrow wilson
they proceeded under the law which specified an
act giving aid and comfort to the enemy this
suppression was ill-advised to say the least for even
then the radio was so extensively used that almost
every home was already apprized of the ships dis-
appearance the reactionaries and conservatives of
that day could not learn and refused to realize even
as do those of the present era that the most effi-
cient agents in spreading radical ideas were not the
propaganda of the discontented but their own acts
of injustice and oppression

 choose the first of the three clippings the
others are further verifications of the facts set
down in the one here reproduced in part

the woodrow wilson lost
ship with  troops and  sailors
vanishes

    new york may  -the woodrow wil-
  son with all on board is lost the transport
  with  troops part of the third contingent
  being sent to mesopotamia and crew of 
  has disappeared the navy department re-
  fuses to discuss the mystery

     it is known that airships flying over the route
  taken by the ship report no small boats or signs
  of wreckage on wireless inquiry of its cor-
  respondents in all ports at which the woodrow
  wilson might touch the union learns that she
  has not been seen where is the ship

   the woodrow wilson was a nine hundred
 foot vessel she sailed on april  and was
 due to reach the persian gulf on april 
 ordinarily a four day run the closing of the
 suez canal and the holding of adjacent terri-
 tory by the franco-italian allies make the trip
 by the way of the cape of good hope neces-
 sary when last heard from the ship was
 southeast of hatteras light the radio station
 there being in constant communication with
 her up to seven-thirty of the evening the ship
 sailed at that hour she reported everything

 o	k then-silence not a word has come
 through since

we ask again where is the woodrow wilson

    we answer at the bottom of the sea with
   of our finest young men and all because
  of the incredible stupidity and venal subservi-
  ence to our millionaires of the officials at wash-
  ington  --

  the article concluded with a diatribe against the
american party then in control of the political
machinery of the nation

the last of ray references is from the visualaud

of sept   doubtless most of you heard of
and saw the ship

    the mystery of the disappearance of the
  woodrow wilson is solved but the mystery of
  what became of her human freight is as great
  as ever the ship which vanished from sight
  on april   was discovered three days
  ago in the victoria desert three hundred miles
  west of ouidabinna south australia and is as
  you can see in as good shape as when she sailed
  out of newport news one hundred years ago
  dr corbeth who made the find asserts that no
  sign of life was found on board her her boats
  all were in place but no food or water was on
  board neither were there the personal belong-
  ings of the troops or sailors although the arms
  of the former were not touched you can see
  them in the racks as left where has she been
  how did she reach this place  miles from
  the sea why have none of the exploring
  parties who passed through the desert in 
  and again in  sighted her you see she
  lies on an even keel on a level sand plain vis-
  ible for miles who will solve the mystery

op men on earth today i alone can give the com-
plete solution i know what happened to the
woodrow wilson for i was one of the fifteen
thousand troops on that vessel when she left and
i was on her when she grounded in the victoria
desert

  we sailed out of newport news aflame with en-
thusiasm and confident that with our knowledge
and abilities once we reached the plains about bag-
dad the seat of war the struggle would be over and
our america triumphant

  for we were picked men young but tried work-
ers in scientific fields i had specialized on atomic
structure until at that time i thought i knew all
there was to know remember in extenuation of
my conceit that i was then but twenty

  distinctions of rank not then having been abol-
ished i found myself quartered with three other
sergeants in a small cabin on the main-deck

  the woodrow wilson was one of a fleet of forty--
seven vessels but by far the largest and fastest
unescorted for our government had not then a
single fighting ship we were twenty miles out be-
fore we picked up the first scout-plane from then
on we knew we would find our route patrolled by
these giant air-cruisers

  i suspect that captain blucher was under orders
to drive the ship at top speed the entire distance
certainly he showed no concern about keeping with
the other units of the fleet we left harbor at six
in the morning by noon not a single transport was
in sight by night we were far south of the latitude
of the carolina capes miles out and driving south-
east through a solitary sea our speed was sixty-
seven knots a clip our internal combustion turbo-
electrics could maintain for forty days without a
stop for fuel

  as i came up on deck that evening there was no
ship no plane no land in sight this pleased me
i was lonesome and wanted to be off alone and
lonely
the electronic wall



  my room-mates were fine fellows my closest
friend on board slim essinger was my bunkmate
slim was a psychologist he really was an expert
on mind mind-control and mind-reading even in
those days mental science was well begun so there
was no need for me to be lonesome

  but i was not only lonesome but sad and de-
pressed as well-sorrowing for lonnie dove i
wanted lonnie every cell of my being called for
her i could almost still feel her kisses fresh on
my lips but i wanted more much more it was
her physical presence for which i yearned

  as i then knew love i was wholly hopelessly in
love with her i failed to recognize in the passionate
desire to hold her in my arms the physical basis of
my love now i can see that the purity of my
love was but the obsession of a closed mind physical
calling to the physical as the primitive in man
surges perilously close to the surface

  i yearned to whisper my longings to hear in
response her breathing of i love you i love you
oh for loneliness for her and me a desert isle a
cavern at the bottom of the sea anywhere that we
might be together together and alone alone-
yes even in my thoughts of her

 i found a sheltered corner by the rail on the boat
deck there i stood and dreamed i do not know
how long certainly not more than an hour for
although darkness had fallen taps was not yet
sounded

  i was alone even the officer in charge had left
the bridge for the shelter of the pilothouse i leaned
against a stanchion gazing off across the sea to the
horizon still sharply cut in the lingering light of
early evening above not a cloud in the sky then
something in the air ahead and high up attracted
my wandering attention were it not for what hap-
pened afterward i might question the truth of the
vision i had time to sense that it wasnt one of
our planes for it was moving toward us at terrific
speed it impressed me as being round not at all
like the shape of a plane

  then we plunged into fog at the time i failed
to realize the peculiarity of this subconsciously i
had noted the broad sea the clear sky no sugges-
tion of vapor yet of a sudden i glanced up and
before i could look down the ship was enveloped in
the mist

  it wasnt particularly dense i could see to the
bow and to the stern and to the water below i
noted that the officer oh watch came out on a run
to the port end of the bridge i saw his hand rest
on a lever and at once there boomed out the siren
in the fog signal foolish i thought if enemies
are about yet if enemy aircraft were near our
scouts would know

  i remember rather rejoicing about the fog in
my present mood it was welcome it shut me in with
my thoughts of lonnie a pleasant shiver of lone-
liness passed over me i gazed down at the rushing
water which suddenly seemed to be getting farther
and farther away i rubbed my eyes to brush away
the webs even then came a whirring roar and the
vessel quivered from stem to stern i heard the
officer shout into a speaking tube and the noise died
at once i had enough of sea experience to recog-
nize the noise for what it was the racing of the

propellers often in heavy seas they are rolled
out then it is the engineers duty to throttle down
the engine before the machinery can jerk itself to
pieces by the high speed

  with amaze written in every line of his figure
the officer stood looking toward where the sea ought
to be but no longer was it visible what in
blankety blank has happened with quick decision
i saw him seize an iron pin from the rack and hurl
it outward listening and the pin-didnt drop
it merely shot out a short distance then as though
tied to a cord came dashing back striking the ship
and coming to rest on the hull a few feet below the
deck i was dumbfounded as for the officer he
slipped out his watch examined it in the light of a
small lamp on the bridge and swore later slim
told me that it is a result of nervous shock moti-
vated exactly as that which in a woman leads to
tears

  by this time the bugles were sounding as-
sembly and the decks were filling with officers and
soldiers something had happened and until it was
known how serious it might be no chances were
being taken i hastened off to my station assigned
before boarding the ship and there met my squad

as far as i could see the men were calm taking
it as a special drill there was no sign of
danger the boat was still even the vibrations of
the engines were absent we rode on an even keel
and save for the fog which hemmed us in might
have been lying at our dock all perfectly normal-
and yet a something above us and an iron belaying
pin clinging to the side of the ship

  doubtless conferences among officers were being
held in all parts of the ship my position with my
squad at the forward doors of the upper deck al-
most beneath the starboard bridge enabled me to
hear much that was said by captain blucher and
others of the ships officers

  -pumps wont work the officer of the watch

was saying as he and the captain came out on the
bridge

  is he asking for time to repair them the cap-
tain asked

  no sir mr macdee reports they turn but
dont pump

  the auxiliary pumps

  dont work either sir

  ill talk to him the captain turned to a 
speaking-tube mr macdee he called macdee 
was our chief engineer	i

  whats this about your pumps the captain 
was short pumps were in the engineers depart-
ment macdee was responsible

  whats that

  the ashes are back

  what    nonsense    certainly were
afloat where did you think we are   no
not a chance of it    no captain blucher
turned and walked to the end of the bridge he
gazed down then beckened to his first officer

  mr steen look down you see the sea no
fog hides it

  no sir the mate leaned far out and pointed
down the hull far below the waterline is visible
but-no water


amazing stories

  just as the captain himself was leaning out the
radio-man came up to my station i must see the
captain he said i saluted and passed him up on
to the bridge

  well i saw the captain turn to meet him

  i have to report sir that since we entered the
fog no messages have been received

  broken down

  no sir every test has been made nor can
we send

  are we bewitched the captain was turning
away as the explosive utterance unconsciously burst
forth forced by his load of responsibility-his to
meet the emergency

  that night was a busy one for the ships crew
as for the troops it was not long before the ten-
sion relaxed and events were accepted as a matter
of course about midnight they were sent back to
quarters

  my squad was one of those kept on guard duty
so that i was able to see many of the efforts made
to ascertain where we were and what was happen-
ing captain blucher and our commander general
waksheh exhausted every means even when the
sailors sent down by rope to investigate came up
and reported that they could pass under the hull
that there was not a sign of the sea the officers still
persisted with rockets and every other thinkable
means of communication to reach one of our air-
craft the story the men told of being unable to
leave the ship at first was given scant attention to
believe that one could not drop from the deck rail
was asking too much but after the chief officers
themselves had gone over and reported on return
that they had walked about the ships bottom with
feet up and heads down and could jump down no
further than one could leap up from the deck every-
one agreed that something far outside the pale of
human understanding had occurred t recalled the
belaying-pin and the captains exclamation the
ashes are back

  one unusual accident occurred during the night
a sentry thinking he saw something off in the fog
fired at it captain green in deck charge came
up on the run no more had he reached the man
under his command than he fell his right leg
broken by a bullet a scurry to take shelter from
the enemy and then the waiting minutes passed
no report was heard and no more missiles were re-
ceived

  captain green was carried to the hospital the
bullet when removed was found to be identical with
those served to the men the small-arms experts un-
hesitatingly pronounced it the very bullet dis-
charged from the soldiers rifle

  that only made the mystery the greater for many
seconds had elapsed after the report of the gun
before the officer was wounded after more figur-
ing the experts announced that if the gun had been
pointed straight up the bullet was due to fall again
at about the time the officer was struck that
sounded well but the soldier swore positively that
he had not pointed the gun away from the vessel
but toward the heavens captain green was sar-
castically as positive that he had not held his leg
out at right angles from his body the only position

in which it might be struck and broken by a falling
bullet

  we did not appear to be in the slightest danger
the ship rode on an even keel without motion of any
sort there was no breeze and the fog hung about
us without movement of sounds other than those
originating on the ship we heard none the gulls
which had followed us from newport news had dis-
appeared

  the radio was tried again and again with no
results save that the private sets on board picked up
the signals without difficulty toward evening of
the second day the staff officers decided to try tele-
pathy which was new at that time and therefore
created much opposition those favoring the at-
tempt argued that there was nothing to lose and
telepathy being in slim essingers department
he was sent for

so great was the advance in mental science up to
the breaking out of the war of  that be-
fore we sailed some of the younger and more pro-
gressive men in the war department made prepara-
tion for the use of thought transference all offi-
cers both those retained at washington and those
despatched were carefully tested the minds of
all were tuned as to rhythmicity synchronism and
harmony in the trials even when the distance be-
tween attuned minds had been three thousand miles
reception and dispatch of thought had been a suc-
cess at the test both radio and wires were at hand
for checking the accuracy here-no matter what
slim might say it would be through him and hia
own words

  he didnt say a thing the effort ended in failure
he tried to send but reported that he sensed oppo-
sition and he could get no return

  some hours later we four sergeants were sitting
on the edges of our bunks speculating on where we
were we had been a little south of the bermudas
when file engines stopped i contended that the
winds would blow us back on the carolina coast
slim was arguing that wed drift south when sud-
denly he stopped

  ran he called to me take me to general
waksheh something is coming through in the
days when telepathy was being mastered concen-
tration was a prime requisite that slim might
utilize every faculty i tucked his hand under my
arm and started for the generals quarters it is
very faint i dont get it plain yet slim told
me as we set out

  i saluted and when the general asked what i had
to report explained that slim was getting a mes-
sage by telepathy general waksheh turned his
attention to the human instrument waiting in some
curiosity i imagined in a few minutes my friend
began to talk sharp and distinct were his words
but the voice was not that of slim essinger

  order every man on board out on deck fear
nothing no action is contemplated against your-
selves or the ship you will be unharmed gather
every man my message is for all then in his
own tones he added to me lead me out on the
bridge

  it sounded like an enemy yet it was but a ser-
geant  talking many an officer on the generals
the electronic wall



staff looked his horror but the general was one
who foresaw the change from the control of an
oligarchy of wealth and position to a real demo-
cracy and he could concede the possibility of a
non-com having an idea besides if slim was
faking-time enough to consider that later but in
the unusual position in which we were even a com-
mand such as this was worth heeding we were
ordered to the upper decks even captain green
with his broken limb was carried up on a stretcher

  dismiss every fear from your mind were the
first words to us as we stood assembled the voice
that spoke was loud and distinct carrying to every
part of the decks yet in the softness and sweet-
ness of the tone was an authority and friendliness
that begot confidence the voice went on

  no harm is to come to anyone on this ship on
the contrary each has been signally honored as fit
for the most important duty that can devolve upon
members of humanity the journey you are being
taken on will last approximately three hundred of
your hours from the time your trip began within
thirty hours the fog will clear when you realize
your position take joy in the view and have no fear
no man will have seen the like before so remember
our promise to you we come not as enemies but as
friends again i ask have confidence in us your
reward will be great you now are to return to
your duties and your places i have nothing more
to communicate at this time

as i consider what was told us and the little
really offered i marvel at the confidence we
manifested in the promises i can account for it
only by believing that the voice was hypnotic this
power of the human voice is not yet established to
the satisfaction of science yet i venture that within
another generation or by  at the latest it will
be acknowledged

  the mathematically inclined on board began
working out destinations postulating a speed
equivalent to the woodrow wilsons best they told
us that in three hundred hours we would have trav-
elled nearly around the world checking on a chart
with this distance as a radius got us nowhere un-
less we wer being led on the grand tour with our
destination san francisco

  others speculated on the view no man had seen
before as our world had bepn pretty well ex-
plored by the year  it didnt seem to mean
much unless the old time hollow globe theory
was correct and we were being led up to the open
pole and down inside our earth-as preposterous a
supposition it seemed as to suppose that the
heavens above were solid with doors and windows
as in the cosmogony of the jews of moses time and
before and to suppose that we were being hauled
up through an open port into the vault above

  friendly curiosity was in possession of our ship
even officers of the old school of the first world
war and its peculiar ideas of mens relationships
were animated by a democratic courtesy formerly
not noticeable

	twenty-four hours passed the fog still held
all had been intent for a happening for the first
few hours the watch became less close as time
went on four hours later and a rush of feet on

the planking above our heads apprized us that some-
thing was going on my own conclusion of course
was that the fog was lifting shouting to slim
come on its clearing i dashed out on the main-
deck

  everyone was crowding the rail to look out across
the sea and-there was no sea we were alone
in a great void in the distance glared a fiery ball
which i knew for the sun of the earth or the
moon i could see nothing yet that is not entirely
true for off at one side was a small round object
which seemed about an inch in diameter and near
it was a bright speck the telescopes on board re-
solved the larger into our earth for they revealed
the continents distinctly and the speck into the
earths satellite-our moon but just then we were
paying no attention to the planet we had left all
hands were raised to point overhead while their
owners cried look there it is what is it
and a multitude of other exclamations

  it was the round thingof my evening experi-
ence though i had secured but a glance i recog-
nized it immediately and now it was revealed in all
its details it was slightly greater in diameter than
the length of our ship nine hundred and sixty-three
feet triangulation revealed as the correct length
from pole to pole it revolved slowly on an axis
formed by these poles which indeed were projections
such as one might expect to find on a globe built to
revolve on a fixed support as we afterwards
learned these were the work of the inhabitants of
paulo as they called their world the real pur-
pose of these projecting parts had nothing to do
with the turning of the globe but were electrically
combined with an electronic element not yet mas-
tered on earth

  the poles were a coppery red a rarified and per-
fected element akin to our copper a median belt
or equatorial region was also constructed of the
same material segmented with an opening like an
insects eye in the center of each segment the
globe itself was a shimmering white shading into
the yellow of the spectrum it had an appearance
such as a mirror in constant violent motion might
present

  slowly turning at a distance of not over a thou-
sand feet the orb hung above us as though we
were the sun and it the earth its axis had an incli-
nation somewhat greater than that of our world to
the central body the purpose of this inclination
was to cut lines of force most effectively as they
were sent from the little world to our ship it was
this that saved us out there in space our ship
would almost instantly have been stripped of heat
and air the woodrow wilson would have become
a gigantic tomb floating in space

  floating did i say hardly that depending
from both poles of the odd planetoid were lines or
filaments supporting above our bow and stern two
bell-shaped objects of the coppery mineral about
each of these clung and continued to cling all dur-
ing our trip the haze or fog that had enveloped us

  as these never varied from their positions with
reference to the ship our first conclusions were that
they supported it yet logic told me and doubtless
the others--i know slim noticed it-that this
could not be ships are built with the idea that

the pressure of water helps stiffen them and hold
their plates or planks in place a great liner lifted
from the water and placed on supports one at each
end would crumple and collapse tremendous truss-
work would be needed if the weight at the center
were to be supported yet here was the woodrow
wilson apparently held and she did not break sev-
eral possibilities offered an explanation one was
that out here in space millions of miles from our
world the attraction of gravitation which on earth
causes the ship to break was wanting such force
of gravity as our ship knew was in itself-or would
have been were not paulo present

  a nother explanation while we could not see

	them there might be lines of attraction lit-
erally billions of them between our craft and the
whirling sphere so that it would be supported not
merely by the two nuclei at the ends with their
visible lines of force but by these others both we
found were at work

  in addition repellant rays were forcing us away
with a push equal to the pull of the attraction the
equilibrium was cleverly maintained also our ship
was surrounded by an invisible sheathing of elec-
trons the electronic wall saving our lives the
electronic wall served many purposes it main-
tained for us the atmospheric pressure-that of air
at sea-level on the earth-to which we were accus-
tomed and without which we could not have existed
it was an insulating medium preventing our heat
content from being dissipated it shut in our air
of oxygen and nitrogen and it insulated us against
certain undulations-not of light-but such as
radio this of course explained why we could not
get messages either to or from the governments
stations apparently it also isolated thought rays
even to communicate with us the inhabitants of
paulo found it necessary to drop through the
wall a minute wire

  the wall and our being insulated from gravity
save our own explained the curious happenings of
the first night-the pin which came back and clung
to the ships side the ashes which would not stay
dumped the men walking head down on the bottom
of the ship and the breaking of captain greens
leg as the rifle was discharged away from the
ship no matter in what direction the bullet had to
return over the same path with the same velocity
the captains limb got in the way that was all

  the tooled ball above us was an inhabited world
a purposeful world over the wire they sent their
thoughts and slim received them through him
we learned something of who they were and of their
history we never saw them i am sure that at
times they visited us on the woodrow wilson but
as they never passed beneath a microscopes lens
their form and shape are unknown we do know
that they had minds and intelligence and as they
told us they were considering the proportionate
size of their world and of ours as large as we were
this would seem to be a working out of natures
laws and would make them  of an inch in
height time for them we found was correspond-
ingly increased or shall i say diminished this
was their chief difficulty in communicating with us
in comparison with our mental processes they

thought with incredible rapidity about  thoughts
to one of ours their ingenuity found a way to
reach us-mechanical it is true depending by an-
alogy on a reversal similar to the method used by
michelson in measuring the velocity of light

  their world they told us was infinitely old even
by our standards their records went back for eons
on eons beyond our surmised time ages they
claimed to have witnessed the birth of the suns
planetary system their account but verified the
chamberlain planetesimal theory

  long long ages ago these people-if i may call
them such-passed through our periods of develop-
ment savagery barbarism slavery serfdom cap-
italism socialism into a pure freedom wherein the
one purpose and delight is to know the truth and
to serve if they are to be believed they live with
no thought for themselves but only that they may
bear succor to inhabitants of other worlds in other
systems and universes thus had our ship been
seized as yet they concealed the purpose from us

  dr baade a clipping on whose reported discov-
ery begins this history had indeed sighted paulo
its movement as observed led him to deduce a path
like to that of a parabola with aphelion far beyond
the othermost planet happening to pass within
the strong gravitational field of the earth he felt
that it was captured and hereafter would travel in
an approximately circular orbit about the world
he was wrong paulo is free

  dr baade could not conceive that a ball so small
could be the home of intelligent beings who con-
trolled absolutely its movements

  long long ago they had discovered the secret of
the atom and its electrons which one hundred years
ago we were just finding and beyond the electron
as far below the electron as the electron was beyond
the atom they found other forces they utilized
the electronic and other energy to the fullest extent
also gravitation its causes and effects had long
ceased to be a mystery to them and had become
instead a servant with such forces-we could
comprehend some but not all concerning which they
hinted-what wonder their world had no fixed orbit
they drive it as they will at speeds unimaginable
neither dr baade nor other scientist look as they
might would ever find it in the same position again
luck alone had given the worthy doctor his sight
of paulo

  of course they explained long ago they had used
up the electronic energy of their world but not
before they had discovered how to control it now
when they ran short they drove their orb to the
sun or some other similar body and took on a load
of energy by absorption paulo and its people
would never die

  they were imniune to extra-paulo effects of
heat and cold their knowledge enabled them to
sheath their world with the substance in which elec-
trons have no movement but are packed in with the
proton one against another this material by earth
standards weighs sixty million tons to a cubic inch
mathematics verifies this in a ball imagined of
such size that an electron is as large as an orange
and the proton is a small pea the radius of the
electronic orbit is about one hundred and fifty miles
plenty of room for weight when packed full
the electronic wall



  we found that they blanketed us with the elec-
tronic fog and rendered it opaque as a matter of
kindness that we might not be fear-smitten and
worried they knew our psychology as we did not
see the earth fall away beneath us when it did come
into view it seemed unreal and we regarded it as an
hallucination or a part of a bad dream likewise
our being gathered to hear the voice was psycho-
logical it made us receptive to hypnotic sugges-
tion

  yet they were honest with us while quieting our
fears and lulling our loneliness and longing for
home and those left behind they made no attempt
to control us absolutely as they easily might have
done volition and choice were left us

  another odd thing they cared for us physically
in a way i cannot explain no one was ill health
on the ship never was better on discovering that
we had a man with a broken leg they sent in new
rays the bone was knit or built up and in two days
captain green left his couch as well as ever

  but where are we going

nphe query was on everyones lips we did not
a believe we were being carried at a speed great
enough to take us to a system outside the solar we
could only guess at our rate of travel but knew the
sun was always with us our navigators took
sights but could give no figures as to position or
speed they were without a fixed point on which
to base a comparison

  to what body were we bound we knew it could
not be the earths moon jupiter saturn or mer-
cury for all on board had some astronomical knowl-
edge neither did neptune nor uranus seem pos-
sibilities all were in such physical condition that
we knew earths inhabitants could not exist on them
while we might be headed for one of the larger
asteroids or one of the large satellites of some
planet majority opinion on board had seized on
venus or mars as our destination

  but what for sergeant graham one of my
room-mates was arguing what use will we be on
either of these planets

  maybe they need more fighters on mars said
slim i guess a rebellion is going to give the
king his

  perhaps the venusians want us to teach them
the correct way to hold a harp and sing in har-
mony sergeant vessick added

  but why suppose the martians are fighters and
the venusians love-birds because we named those
planets that doesnt give their inhabitants charac-
teristics we associate with those names does it
i too had a theory why may we not be needed
as teachers for a race lower in accomplishments
than ours on whom the inhabitants of paulo have
taken pity

  all guesswork of course slim insisted
there are hundreds and thousands of possibilities
but granting we are to teach are we to show them
how to make modern weapons how to prepare poi-
son gas shall we educate them into the lying
hypocritical selfishness we call civilization shall
we show them what war is

  perhaps supposing they dont know any of the
things we do what will we teach them if not how

to make them and how to sell them so as to get a
profit sergeant vessick elaborated at some
length we all entered the discussion

  time passed there was no day there was no
night watches continued to click off time but ever
in the heavens burned a brilliant orb and all over
the black vault above below and round about glit-
tered points of light some large some tiny three
hundred hours the voice from slims lips had
said in that time we could travel to-

  some argued that paulo with us in tow could
not travel at as great a speed as did any of the
planets but suppose we did mercury with her
 miles a minute gave for three hundred hours
of travel the distance from the earth to mars

  on the other hand others argued that it was just
as reasonable to suppose we were travelling at
twice or ten times that speed certain stars have
been determined to be moving at as high a rate as
ten thousand miles a minute

  why the careful preparation of the little globe
if not that it may take on almost infinite speed
they contended and why not even at a speed
of two thousand miles ten hours before landing we
still would be so far away from our destination that
probably we hardly would realize our approach to it

  but by the fifth hour from the end of the time
set by our captors a luminous speck in the sky did
seem somewhat brighter and larger by the second
hour it had grown to gigantic dimensions and for
the next hour it looked as though we were rushing
headlong to destruction yet we seemed neither
worried nor anxious such was the confidence with
which the inhabitants of paulo had inspired us

  the time limit expired and still we had not
reached the new sphere gigantic it lay beneath us
and all were scanning it glancing up i noted that
a change had come over the tiny world above us
its revolution had ceased and from the ports in the
equatorial girdle extended huge masts jointed and
apparently telescopic i jumped to the conclusion
later verified by slims unknown informant on
paulo that these were necessary for controlling 
the electronic anti-gravitational force the method
is simple protons positively charged are detached
from the electrons with their negative pull the
combined push and pull when controlled counter-
acts gravitational force which is itself protonic in
nature

  it was but a short time after this that the trum-
pets sounded fall in we gathered on the upper
decks where slim awaited us on the bridge with
the voices final message

txe have now brought you almost to your des-
  tination but before we land you upon this
planet mayalovan as its inhabitants speak of it
or as you most inappropriately name it mars we
warn you of conditions you will be taught and
helped to overcome

  your energies your lung capacity your blood
pressure and other physical peculiarities have de-
veloped through myriad generations enabling you
to exist in the earths gaseous envelope not for an
instant could you live in the atmosphere which we
here on paulo find most beneficial

  the gravity on mayalovan being but one-fourth

that to which you are accustomed you will be able
to perform marvellous feats of lifting and jumping
be advised do not attempt them for in so doing
you use up your energies as rapidly as on earth and
here you will not find the atmosphere conditioned to
recuperative processes such as you know not only
will it take four times as long to repair the waste
tissues but four times four and the process will
be infinitely more painful avoid exertion

  mayalovans air is built up differently from the
earths the proportion of carbon dioxide on your
world is one to twenty-five hundred here it is much
greater we know it is not in sufficient quantity to
cause death but it may cause inconvenience this
with other reasons lead us to place you in an accli-
mating hall you will leave the ship under cover of
the electronic wall and enter this chamber

  here you will remain one hundred days you
will at first live under a pressure and in a breathing
medium similar to what you have been accustomed
gradually pressure will be diminished and the car-
bon dioxide content increased by the end of this
period you will have learned how to handle your-
selves upon mayalovan without danger or discom-
fort you then may step out upon the planet you
will be ready for your mission

  know you that your errand is one almost of
divine significance that not only will you give of
the seed of life but you will be rewarded in a man-
ner you now cannot realize your lives will be
sweetened purified and exalted and a love that
passes your understanding of the present will be
yours

  we long have known what is but suspected by
your scientists-that the female life principle is far
stronger and more persistent than that of the male
on mayalovan the result of this was long ago fore-
seen the women have grown stronger more beau-
tiful more intelligent so too have the men but-
the males gradually disappeared for births became
dominantly female today few men live on maya-
lovan if the race shall live-and we would not
being able to prevent it permit it to perish-males
from another world must be brought to mayalovan
to you a selected body of men we offer this honor
yes and the reward your ship was deliberately
chosen for although the races of earth are far far
behind in the race for the attainment of knowledge
and eternal truth you who listen are of all earth-
bound the most advanced you are a picked body
of men the flower of your civilization yet from
mayalovan you will have much to learn

  day by day you will see the women of this planet
and each will be chosen nay already has been se-
lected by her whose soul is most closely attuned
and harmonized with his there will be no hap-
hazard falling in love you shall learn what is the
perfect union yet you are not forced to remain
on mayalovan should any wish to return to earth
we will wipe their minds clear of the happenings
and set them back are there any such

  strange was it hypnotism or the higher
spirituality of the appeal or mob psychology
certainly not a soul backed out

  we did not believe any would fail to heed our
appeal went on the voice this then is the
great purpose to which you have been dedicated

may the great all-loving unity reward you you
have come

  as the words were spoken there was a slight jerk
a creak and all was still a glance over the side
revealed the vessel resting on a rocky height in the
midst of a green carpet of vegetation

  attention commanded the voice through
slim officers for the last time command your
men as you march oft the electronic wall is about
you once more we offer if a man would not
come let him speak now is the time

  not a voice in all that host was raised in protest
i felt only an anticipation a calm happiness and
never a thought of lonnie dove whom i had left
but ten days before with vows of eternal constancy
i felt no regrets no moral doubts nor do i now
so much do mayalovans women exceed earths
loveliest

  we marched forth to meet love for on the
plain to greet us were the women of mayalovan
beauty-the short sharp indrawing of breath
the gigantic sigh of eighteen thousand men came
as if of a single being beauty transcendent
ethereal never have i dreamed of such loveliness
the gross was gone only the pure the unselfish
the sweetness of great knowledge and love written
in the features remained

  as an iron filing to a magnet the gaze of each
of us travelled to the face of the one woman there
it rested for each woman was looking at her
future mate one hundred days- i sighed with
regret at such a period of time so vast until i
offer my all to her and i sensed she was thinking
the same until i can serve him for already
mayalovan had reached the stage where service was
synonymous with living

  we found we could communicate with one an-
other even as the earth in  was approaching
the knowledge of thought transference so in maya-
lovan this method of communication was an achieve-
ment of past ages no need for us to learn the
language of mayalovan nor for them to learn ours
thoughts are but pictures the same in any lan-
guage

  slowly dragged the hours until the end of the hun-
dred days during the period of acclimatization
much had happened no sooner had we left the
woodrow wilson than paulo whirled it aloft and
away dropping it uninjured as we later learned
at the south pole of mayalovan there it rested
until-but i proceed too swiftly

itte learned much of mayalovan earths as-
  tronomers have slowly been unravelling its
mysteries by deductive processes which being based
on hypotheses true in the world did not however
apply on mayalovan

  mayalovan has life outside the human it is en-
tirely of the plant kingdom even the bacilli of
decomposition are wanting cell life such as we
could determine was wholly confined to human be-
ings and to the vegetable kingdom the green car-
pet to which we descended on leaving the ship was
a peculiar moss developed into bearing a nourish-
ing fruit this we could see grow and increase in
size as we watched for in the unprotected open it
grows bears fruits and dies in a single day re-
the electronic wall



peating this over and over during the summer
leaves and stalk too are edible it goes without
saying that mayalovan is vegetarian but what of
that food is not for sensuous enjoyment rather
for rebuilding expended bodily tissues on maya-
lovan we make no great feasts and eat only the
measured requirements

  the polar caps are not as supposed they are
neither clouds nor snow nor solidified carbon diox-
ide instead they are great treble-walled sheets of
a light durable non-conducting metal in mayalo-
van called amnia these sheets are put up as
the winter comes on and taken down with the advent
of summer in a manner that never varies each
plate of gigantic size compared with those used on
earth uptilts by mechanical means slips into a
groove in the soils surface and in the hot sun of
the daytime the fields of moss thrive and grow

  machines and devices undreamed of on earth are
in common use all made of amnia which is con-
sidered the perfect metal planting harvesting
conveyance-all are mechanical

  water so necessary to plant life and almost gone
from mayalovan is carefully stored in great am-
nia tanks in the interior of the planet it is
pumped out as needed through thousands of open-
ings following artificial channels to the fertile parts
of mayalovan on its return it descends through
rocky channels and over precipices until it finds a
conductor-pit on every stage of its journey it is
carefully guarded the air is sucked through great
vents and denuded of its vapor the statement is
made on mayalovan that our-water will last for
ninety million years before it is all used up why
bother about ones descendants ninety million years
hence ah that is what the service concept means
not for ones self but for others born and un-
born

  as the water is stored in the interior recesses of
the planet there too well-lighted warmed and ven-
tilated by artificially renovated air are the homes
of mayalovan on the surface only old ruins now
almost disintegrated show to these i must except
the covers which top the vents of the inlets and out-
lets these invariably are domes resting on
threaded pillars in preparation for the cold nights
these pillars gigantic screws are drawn down and
lock the covers into place on mornings when it is
warm enough for human life on the surface they
are raised and one may visit where one wishes
should one chance to remain out after the set clos-
ing time he is not condemned to death in each
dome-base is a door giving admittance to a tempera-
ture-lock from which one descends to the city below

  one thing which i failed to note so entranced
was i with ahlovahs beauty was the feathery
wing-like growth on the back of my-wifes arms
from elbows up over her shoulders meeting on the
top of her head this has something the appear-
ance of the wings with which the humans of earth
endow their angels these of mayalovan are not
for flying rather they are a development from the
hair for receiving and discharging thoughts ahlo-
vah tells me they are of no great antiquity having
appeared on mayalovan humans within the last hun-
dred thousand years i have not developed any such
although ahlovah cheers me by saying she can feel

the fibrils coming our children have them as fully
as ahlovah and the other women

  at the expiration of the hundred days what a
marriage feast did old mayalovan witness how
swiftly sped the years since then the happiness of
good deeds well done and the pleasure of knowledge
acquired not for self but for all ahlovah and i
have been rewarded we have four children two
girls and two boys beautiful children and when
i say beautiful children i am thinking not only
of my own i mean all those descended from the
men who sailed from newport news on the wood-
row wilson on that april day nearly one hundred
years ago

  of us men of earth i can say truthfully not one
regrets that he did not return when opportunity
offered we have a reward beyond price in the love
we give and get the birth of children on mayalo-
van is a reward and privilege given mankind to 
carry on the great scheme of the universe

  but enough i could talk forever on mayalovan
and our wondrous life there to return now to the
third of my references that of the visualaud of
sept   the first clipping i used to intro-
duce and substantiate the history of our doings with
paulo the second forms the background for my
explanation of the events which befell the woodrow
wilson and her crew and passengers up to the re-
appearance of the ship as chronicled by the visua-
laud referred to

  no need of wild theories to explain its being
found in the sand wastes of australia the truth is
simple it was picked up again from mayalovan
and used as a vehicle to return me to this world
and my mission done paulo again will pick it up
and return me to my loved ones

  i am here to serve

ftte on mayalovan had hoped that after all
  these years we would be left undisturbed to
complete our cycle of love and knowledge but
recently we discovered-for even we mortals of
earth have acquired telepathic powers-that the
earth was heading straight for another world con-
flict which would actively involve every human be-
ing resulting in death the torture of living death
and hopeless despair for nearly everyone the
humanists on paulo brought the word they could
not bear to see such torture perpetrated nor con-
sider the misery resulting when it is so wholly un-
called for the old world has advanced far enough
by this time so that it ought to know better than to
turn such a weapon on itself why should petty
rivalries for this land or that land send men to die
there is enough and to spare why should petty
jealousy or a feeling of affront inspire hatred
jealousy and supersensitiveness are subjective in
reality they cannot exist

  the little folk on paulo found that they could
accomplish nothing because of their size and the
vast numbers of humanity they came to us who
were earth born would one of us go back with
our new knowledge and added powers we could pre-
vent the awful cataclysm who would go

  with the old spirit only the great happiness we
were blessed with would have deterred anyone from
such a duty now with the new love there were

eighteen thousand volunteers of course all could
not go cross purposes cross transfers of thought
even though well intended would work more harm
than good choice we said should determine the
one to make the trip i was honored by luck

  this then is my first appeal that you may un-
derstand that i speak of what i know and from a
world where war long ago has become obsolete i
write this for my friend victor h jernseck his
magazine owning to a life of nearly one hundred
and twenty-five years circulates now through the
visualaud in twenty-seven million homes may i
ask that on december first of this year all who get
this history will listen for my telepathic messages

  daily thereafter will i proclaim to the world that
good always is more powerful than evil that anger

and hatred and war cannot exist where the friendly
word is spoken

  will you who love the right join me day by day in
sending out the thoughts christian pagan jew
or mohammedan brahman or buddhist black or
red white or yellow of whatever race or creed
color or nationality if you would have peace hold
the world heed my call

  i have nothing to gain i come but to serve
good is all powerful let your thoughts carry it
for this be sure hatred cannot shut out good
much as it may struggle anger can be subdued it
cannot shut itself away from love to shut love out
there never was and never will be an electronic
wall if you doubt join me on my return trip to
mayalovan in the woodrow wilson

third prize winner in the  prize cover
contest

third prize of  awarded to mrs f c harris  lincoln avenue
lakewood ohio for the fate of the poseidonia

   and before my startled vision a scene presented itself i seemed to be inside a bamboo hut looking toward an open-
ing which afforded a glimpse of a wave-washed sandy beach and a few palm trees  while my fascinated gaze dwelt
on the scene before me a shadow fell athwart the huts entrance and the figure of a man came toward me

the fate of the poseidonia

by clare winger harris

i

first moment i laid eyes on martell i
fihi phl k a reat dislike to the man there
fjjgjjjfsl sprang up between us an antagonism
that as far as he was concerned might
saiissifeal have remained passive but which cir-
cumstances forced into activity on my side

   how distinctly i recall
the occasion of our meet-
ing at the home of pro-
fessor stearns head of
the astronomy depart-
ment of austin college

the address which the
professor proposed giving
before the mentor club
of which i was a member
was to be on the subject
of the planet mars the
spacious front rooms of
the stearns home were
 crowded for the occasion

with rows of chairs and at the end of the double
parlors a screen was erected for the purpose of
presenting telescopic views of the ruddy planet in
its various aspects

  as i entered the parlor after shaking hands wth
my hostess i felt rather than saw an unfamiliar
presence and the impression i received involuntar-
ily was that of antipathy
what i saw was the pro-
fessor himself engaged in
earnest conversation with
a stranger intuitively i
knew that from the latter
emanated the hostility of
which i was definitely
conscious

  he was a man of slight-
ly less than average
height at once i noticed
that he did not appear
exactly normal physically
and yet i could not

 vhat the third prize winner should prove to be a
 woman was one of the surprises of the contest for
 as a rule women do not make good scientifiction writers
 because their education and general tendencies on sci-
 entific matters are usually limited but the exception
 as usual proves the rule the exception in this case be-
 ing extraordinarily impressive the story has a great
 deal of charm chiefly because it is not overburdened
 with science but whatever science is contained therein
 is not only quite palatable but highly desirable due to its
 plausibilitynot only this but you will find that the
 author is a facile writer who keeps your interest unto
 the last line we hope to see more of mrs harriss
 scientifiction in amazing stories

ascertain in what way he was deficient it was not
until i had passed the entire evening in his company
that i was fully aware of his bodily peculiarities
perhaps the most striking characteristic was the
swarthy coppery hue of his flesh that was not unlike
that of an american indian his chest and should-
ers seemed abnormally developed his limbs and feat-
ures extremely slender in proportion another
peculiar individuality was the wearing of a skull-
cap pulled well down over his forehead

  professor stearns caught my eye and with a
friendly nod indicated his desire that i meet the new
arrival

  glad to see you mr gregory he said warmly
as he clasped my hand i want you to meet mr
martell a stranger in our towfl but a kindred spirit
in that he is interested in astronomy and particu-
larly in the subject of my lecture this evening

  i extended my hand to mr martell and imagined
that he responded to my salutation somewhat reluc-
tantly immediately i knew why the texture of
the skin was most unusual for want of a better
simile i shall say that it felt not unlike a fine dry
sponge i do not believe that i betrayed any visible
surprise though inwardly my whole being revolted
the deep close-set eyes of the stranger seemed
searching me for any manifestation of antipathy
but i congratulate myself that my outward poise
was undisturbed by the strange encounter

  the guests assembled and i discovered to my
chagrin that i was seated next to the stranger mar-
tell suddenly the lights were extinguished pre-
paratory to the presentation of the lantern-slides
the darkness that enveloped us was intense su-
preme horror gripped me when i presently became
conscious of two faint phosphorescent lights to my
right there could be no mistaking their origin
they were the eyes of martell and they were re-
garding me with an enigmatical stare fascinated

i	gazed back into those diabolical orbs with an emo-
tion akin to terror i felt that i should shriek and
then attack their owner but at the precise mo-
ment when my usually steady nerves threatened to
betray me the twin lights vanished a second later
the lantern light flashed on the screen i stole a
furtive glance in the direction of martell he was
sitting with his eyes closed

  the planet mars should be of particular interest
to us began professor stearns not only because
of its relative proximity to us but because of the
fact that there are visible upon its surface undeni-
able evidences of the handiwork of man and i am
inclined to believe in the existence of mankind there
not unlike the humanity of the earth

  the discourse proceeded uninterruptedly the
audience remained quiet and attentive for profes-
sor stearns possessed the faculty of holding his lis-
teners spell-bound a large map of one hemisphere
of mars was thrown on the screen and simultan-
eously the stranger martell drew in his breath
sharply with a faint whistling sound

  the professor continued friends do you observe
that the outstanding physical difference between
mars and terra appears to be in the relative dis-
tribution of land and water on our own globe the
terrestrial parts lie as distinct entities surrounded
by the vast aqueous portions whereas on mar the
land and water are so intermingled by gulfs bays

capes and peninsulas that it requires careful study
to ascertain for a certainty which is which it is
my opinion and i do not hold it alone for much dis-
cussion with my worthy colleagues has made it obvi-
ous that the peculiar land contours are due to the
fact that water is becoming a very scarce commodity
on our neighboring planet much of what is now
land is merely the exposed portions of the one-time
ocean bed the precious life-giving fluid now occupy-
ing only the lowest depressions we may conclude
that the telescopic eye when turned on mars sees
a waning world the habitat of a people struggling
desperately and vainly for existence with inevitable
extermination facing them in the not far distant
future what will they do if they are no farther
advanced in the evolutionary stage than a carrot or
a jelly-fish they will ultimately succumb to fate but
if they are men and women such as you and i they
will fight for the continuity of their race i am
inclined to the opinion that the martians will not
die without putting up a brave struggle which will
result in the prolongation of their existence but
not in their complete salvation

  professor stearns paused are there any ques-
tions he asked

  i was about to speak when the voice of martell
boomed in my ear startling me

  in regard to the map professor he said i
believe that gulf which lies farthest south is not a
gulf at all but is a part of the land portion sur-
rounding it i think you credit the poor dying
planet with even more water than it actually has
it is possible and even probable that i have
erred replied the learned man and i am sorry
indeed if that gulf is to be withdrawn from the
credit of the martians for their future must look
very black

  just suppose resumed martell leaning toward
the lecturer with interested mieny that the mar-
tians were the possessors of an intelligence equal to
that of terrestrials what might they do to save
themselves from total extinction in other words
to bring it home to us more realistically what would
we do were we threatened with a like disaster
that is a very difficult question to answer and
one upon which merely an opinion could be ven-
tured smiled professor stearns  necessity is
the mother of invention and in our case without
the likelihood of the existence of the mother we can
hardly hazard a guess as to the nature of the
offspring but always as terras resources have
diminished the mind of man has discovered substi-
tutes there has always been a way out and let us
hope our brave planetary neighbors will succeed in
solving their problem

  let us hope so indeed echoed the voice of mar-
tell

ii

at the time of my story in the winter of -
 i was still unmarried and was living in
a private hotel on e ferguson ave where i en-
joyed the comforts of well furnished bachelor quar-
ters to my neighbors i paid little or no attention
absorbed in my work during the day and paying
court to margaret landon in the evenings
the fate of the poseidonia



  i was not a little surprised upon one occasion as
i stepped into the corridor to see a strange yet
familiar figure in the hotel locking the door of the
apartment adjoining my own almost instantly i
recognized martell on whom i had not laid eyes
since the meeting some weeks previous at the home
of professor stearns he evinced no more pleasure
at our meeting than i did and after the exchange
of a few cursory remaiks from which i learned that
he was my new neighbor we went our respective
ways

  i thought no more of the meeting and as i am
not blessed or cursed as the case may be with a
natural curiosity concerning the affairs of those
about me i seldom met martell and upon the rare
occasions when i did we confined our remarks to
that ever convenient topic the weather

  between margaret and myself there seemed to be
growing an inexplicable estrangement that in-
creased as time went on but it was not until after
five repeated futile efforts to spend an evening in
her company that i suspected the presence of a rival
imagine my surprise and chagrin to discover that
rival in the person of my neighbor martell i saw
them together at the theatre and wondered even
with all due modesty what there was in the ungainly
figure and peculiar character of martell to attract a
beautiful and refined girl of margaret landons
type but attract her he did for it was plainly evi-
dent as i watched them with the eyes of a jealous
lover that margaret was fascinated by the person-
ality of her escort

  in sullen rage i went to margaret a few days
later expressing my opinion of her new admirer in
derogatory epithets she gave me calm and digni-
fied attention until i had exhausted my vocabulary
voicing my ideas of martell then she made reply
in martells defense

  aside from personal appearance mr martell is
a forceful and interesting character and i refuse
to allow you todictate to me who my associates are
to be there is no reason why we three can not all
be friends

  martell hates me as i hate him i replied with
smoldering resentment that is sufficient reason
why we three can not all be friends

  i think you must be mistaken she replied
curtly mr martell praises your qualities as a
neighbor and comments not infrequently on your
excellentvirtue of attending strictly to your own
business

  i left margarets presence in a down-hearted
mood

  so martell appreciates my lack of inquisitive-
ness does he i mused as later i reviiwed mentally
the closing words of margaret and right then and
there doubts and suspicions arose in my mind if
self-absorption was an appreciable quality as far as
martell was concerned there was reason for his
esteem of that phase of my character i had dis-
covered the presence of a mystery martell had
something to conceal

  it was new years day not january st as they
had it in the old days but the extra new years
day that was sandwiched as a separate entity be-
tween two years this new chronological reckoning
had been put into use in  the calendar had

previously contained twelve months varying in
length from twenty-eight to thirty-one days but
with the addition of a new month and the adoption
of a uniformity of twenty-eight days for all months
and the interpolation of an isolated new years day
the worlds system of chronolgy was greatly simpli-
fied it was as i say on new years day that i
arose later than usual and dressed myself the buzz-
ing monotone of a voice from martells room an-
noyed me could he be talking over the telephone
to margaret right then and there i stooped to
the performance of a deed of which i did not think
myself capable ineffable curiosity converted me
into a spy and an eavesdropper i dropped to my
knees and peered through the keyhole i was re-
warded with an unobstructed profile view of martell
seated at a low desk on which stood a peculiar cub-
ical mechanism measuring on each edge six or
seven inches above it hovered a tenuous vapor and
from it issued strange sounds occasionally inter-
rupted by remarks from martell uttered in an un-
known tongue good heavens was this a new-
fangled radio that communicated with the spirit-
world for only in such a way could i explain the
peculiar vapor that enveloped the tiny machine
television had been perfected and in use for a gen-
eration but as yet no instrument had been invented
which delivered messages from the unknown
bourne

  i crouched in my undignified position until it was
with difficulty that i arose at the same time that
martell shut off the mysterious contrivance could
margaret be involved in any diabolical schemes
the very suggestion caused me to break out in a
cold sweat surely margaret the very personifica-
tion of innocence and purity could be no partner in
any nefarious undertakings i resolved to call her
up she answered the phone and i thought her
voice showed agitation

  margaret this is george i said are you all
right 

  she answered faintly in the affirmative

  may i come over at once i pled i have some-
thing important to tell you

  to my surprise she consented and i lost no time
in speeding my volplane to her home with no in-
troductory remarks i plunged right into a narrative
of the peculiar and suspicious actions of martell
and ended by begging her to discontinue her asso-
ciation with him ever well poised and with a girl-
ish dignity that was irresistibly charming mar-
garet quietly thanked me for my solicitude for her
well-being but assured me that there was nothing
to fear from martell it was like beating against a
brick wall to obtain any satisfaction from her so i
returned to my lonely rooms there to brood in soli-
tude over the unhappy change that martell had
brought into my life

  once agajn i gazed through the tiny aperture my
neighbor was nowhere to be seen but on the desk
stood that which i mentally termed the devil-
machine the subtle mist that had previously hov-
ered above it was wanting

  the next day upon arising i was drawn as by a
magnet toward the keyhole but my amazement knew
no bounds when i discovered that it had been plug-

ged from the other side and my vision completely
barred

  well i guess it serves me right i muttered in
my chagrin i ought to keep out of other peoples
private affairs but i added as an afterthought in
feeble defense of my actions my motive is to save
margaret from that scoundrel and such i wanted
to prove him to be before it was too late

ill

the sixth of april  was a memorable day
in the annals of history especially to the inhabi-
tants of pacific coast cities throughout the world
radios buzzed with the alarming and mystifying
news that just over night the ocean line had receded
several feet what cataclysm of nature could have
caused the disappearance of thousands of tons of
water inside of twenty-four hours  scientists ven-
tured the explanation that internal disturbances
must have resulted in the opening of vast submarine
fissures into which the seas had poured

  this explanation stupendous as it was sounded
plausible enough and was accepted by the world at
large which was too busy accumulating gold and
silver to worry over the loss of nearly a million tons
of water how little we then realized that the rela-
tive importance of gold and water was destined to
be reversed and that man was to have forced upon
him a new conception of values which would bring
to him a complete realization of his former erron-
eous ideas

  may and june passed marking little change in the
drab monotony that had settled into my life since
margaret landon had ceased to care for me one
afternoon early in july i received a telephone call
from margaret her voice betrayed an agitated
state of mind and sorry though i was that she was
troubled it pleased me that she had turned to me in
her despair hope sprang anew in my breast and
i told her i would be over at once

  i was admitted by the taciturn housekeeper and
ushered into the library where margaret rose to
greet me as i entered there were traces of tears in
her lovely eyes she extended both hands to me in a
gesture of spontaneity that had been wholly lacking
in her attitude toward me ever since the advent of
martell in the role of protector and advisor i felt
that i was about to be reinstated in her regard

  but my joy was short-lived as i beheld a recum-
bent figure on the great davenport and recognized
it instantly as that of martell so he was in the
game after all margaret had summoned me be-
cause her lover was in danger i turned to go but
felt a restraining hand

  wait george the girl pled the doctor will
be here any minute

  then let the doctor attend to him i replied
coldly i know nothing of the art of healing

  i know george margaret persisted but he
mentioned you before he lost consciousness and i
think he wants to speak to you wont you wait
please

  i paused hesitant at th supplicating tones of her
whom i loved but at that moment the maid an-
nounced the doctor and i made a hasty exit

  needless to say i experienced a sense of guilt as
i returned to my rooms

  but i argued as i seated myself comfortably
before my radio a rejected lover would have to be
a very magnanimous specimen of humanity to go
running about doing favors for a rival what do
the pair of them take me for anyway-a fool

  i rather enjoyed a consciousness of righteous in-
dignation but disturbing visions of margaret gave
me an uncomfortable feeling that there was much
about the affair that was incomprehensible to me

  the transatlantic passenger-plane pegasus has
mysteriously disappeared said the voice of the
news announcer one member of her crew has
been picked up who tells such a weird fantastic tale
that it has not received much credence according
to his story the pegasus wag winging its way across
mid-ocean last night keeping an even elevation of
three thousand feet when without any warning the
machine started straight up some force outside of
itself was drawing it up but whither the rescued
mechanic the only one of all the fated ships pas-
sengers possessed the presence of mind to manipu-
late his parachute and thus descended in safety be-
fore the air became too rare to breathe and before
he and the parachute could be attracted upwards
he stoutly maintains that the plane could not have
fallen later without his knowledge scouting planes
boats and submarines sent out this morning verify
his seemingly mad narration not a vestige of the
pegasus -is to be found above on the surface or be-
low the water is this tragedy in any way connected
with the lowering of the ocean level has some one
a theory in the face of such an inexplicable
enigma the government will listen to the advance-
ment of any theories in the hope of solving the mys-
tery too many times in the past have the so-called
level-headed people failed to give ear to the warn-
ings of theorists and dreamers but now we know
thatthe latter are often the possessors of a sixth
sense that enables them to see that to which the bulk
of mankind is blind		

  i was awed by the fate of the pegasus i had had
two flights in the wonderful machine myself three
years ago and i knew that it was the last word in
luxuriant air-travel

  how long i sat listening to brief news bulletins
and witnessing scenic flashes of worldly affairs i
do not know but there suddenly came to my mind
and persisted in staying there a very disquieting
thought several times i dismissed it as unworthy
of any consideration but it continued with unmiti-
gating tenacity

  after an hour of mental pros and cons i called up
the hotel office

  this is mr gregory in suite  i strove to
keep my voice steady mr martell of  is ill at
the house of a friend he wishes me to have some
of his belongings taken to him may i have the key
to his rooms

  there was a pause that to me seemed intermin-
able then the voice of the clerk certainly mr
gregory ill send a boy up with it at once

  i felt like a culprit of the deepest dye as i entered
martells suite a few moments later and gazed about
me i knew i might expect interference from any
quarter at any moment so i wasted no time in a
general susvey of the apartment but proceeded at
once to the object of my visit the tiny machine
which i now perceived was more intricate than i
the fate of the poseidonia



had supposed from my previous observations
through the keyhole stood in its accustomed place
upon the desk it had four levers and a dial and i
decided to manipulate each of these in turn i com-
menced with the one at my extreme left for a
moment apparently nothing happened then i real-
ized that above the machine a mist was forming

  at first it was faint and cloudy but the haziness
quickly cleared and before my startled vision a scene
presented itself i seemed to be inside a bamboo
hut looking toward an opening which afforded a
glimpse of a wave-washed sandy beach and a few
palm trees silhouetted against the horizon i could
imagine myself on a desert isle i gasped in aston-
ishment but it was nothing to the shock which was
to follow while my fascinated gaze dwelt on the
scene before me a shadow fell athwart the huts
entrance and the figure of a man came toward me
i uttered a hoarse cry for a moment i thought i
had been transplanted chronologically to the discov-
ery of america for the being who approached me
bore a general resemblance to an indian chief from
his forehead tall white feathers stood erect he
was without clothing and his skin had a reddish cast
that glistened with a coppery sheen in the sunlight
wherp had i seen those features or similar ones
recently i had it martell the indian savage
was a natural replica of the suave and civilized
martell and yet was this man before me a savage 
on the contrary i noted that his features displayed
a remarkably keen intelligence

  the stranger approached a table upon which i
seemed to be and raised his arms a muffled cry
escaped my lips the feathers that i had supposed
constituted his headdress were attached perma-
nently along the upper portion of his arms to a
point a little below each elbow they grew there
this strange being had feathers instead of hair

  i do not know by what presence of mind i man-
aged to return the lever to its original position but
i did and sat weakly gazing vacantly at the air
where but a few seconds before a vivid tropic scene
had been visible suddenly a low buzzing sound was
heard only for an instant was i mystified then i
knew that the stranger of the desert-isle was en-
deavoring to summon martell

  weak and dazed i waited until the buzzing had
ceased and then i resolutely pulled the second of
the four levers at the inception of the experiment
the same phenomena were repeated but when a cor-
rect perspective was effected a very different scene
was presented before my startled vision this time
i seemed to be in a luxuriant room filled with costly
furnishings but i had time only for a most fleeting
glance for a section of newspaper that had inter-
cepted part of my view moved and from behind its
printed expanse emerged a being who bore a resem-
blance to martell and the indian of the desert island
jit required but a second to turn off the mysterious
connection but that short time had been of sufficient
duration to enable me to read the heading of the
paper in the hands of a copper-hued man it was
die miinchener zeitung

  still stupefied by the turn of events it was with
a certain degree of enjoyment that i continued to
experiment with the devil-machine i was startled
when the same buzzing sound followed the discon-
necting of the instrument

  i was about to manipulate the third lever when i
became conscious of pacing footsteps in the outer
hall was i arousing the suspicion of the hotel
officials leaving my seat before the desk i began
to move about the room in semblance of gathering
together martells required articles apparently
satisfied the footstepsretreated down the corridor
and were soon inaudible

  feverishly now i fumbled with the third lever
there was no time to lose and i was madly desirous
of investigating all the possibilities of this new kind
of television-set i had no doubt that i was on the
track of a nefarious organization of spies and i
worked on in the self-termed capacity of a sherlock
holmes 

  the third lever revealed an apartment no less
sumptuous than the german one had been it ap-
peared to be unoccupied for the present and i had
ample time to survey its expensive furnishings
which had an oriental appearance through an open
window at the far end of the room i glimpsed a
mosque with domes and minarets i could not as-
certain for a certainty whether this was turkey or
india it might have been any one of many eastern
lands i could not know the fact that the occupant
of this oriental apartment was temporarily absent
made me desirous of learning more about it but
time was precious to me now and i disconnected
no buzzing followed upon this occasion which
strengthened my belief that my lever manipulation
sounded a similar buzzing that was audible in the
various stations connected for the purpose of ac-
complishing some wicked scheme

  the fourth handle invited me to further investiga-
tion i determined to go through with my secret
research though i died in the effort just before
my hand dropped the buzzing commenced and i
perceived for the first time a faint glow near the
lever of no  i dared not investigate  at this
time for i did not wish it known that another than
martell was at this station i thought of going on
to dial  but an innate love of system forced me
to risk a loss of time rather than to take them out
of order the buzzing continued for the usual dura-
tion of time but i waited until it had apparently
ceased entirely before i moved no 

  my soul rebelled at that which took form from
the emanating mist a face another duplicate of
martells but if possible more cruel confronted me
completely filling up the vaporous space and two
phosphorescent eyes seared a warning into my own
a nauseating sensation crept over me as my hand
crept to the connecting part of no  when every
vestige of the menacing face had vanished i arose
weakly and took a few faltering steps around the
room a bell was ringing with great persistance
from some other room it was mine it would be
wise to answer it i fairly flew back to my room and
was rewarded by the sound of margarets voice with
a note of petulance in it

 why didnt you answer george the phone
rang several times

  couldnt was taking a bath i lied

  mr martell is better continued margaret the
doctor says theres no immediate danger

  there was a pause and the sound of a rasping
voice a little away from the vicinity of the phone
and then margarets voice came again


amazing stories

  mr martell wants you to come over george he
wants to see you

  tell him i have to dress after my bath then
ill come i answered

iv

there was not a moment to spare i rushed
back into martells room determined to see this
thing through i had never been subject to heart
attacks but certainly the suffocating sensation that
possessed me could be attributed to no other ciuse

  a loud buzzing greeted my ears as soon as i had
closed the door of martells suite i looked toward
the devil-machine the four stations were buzzing
at once what was i to do there was no light
near dial  and that alone remained uninvestigated
my course of action was clear try out no  to my
satisfaction leave martells rooms and go to mar-
garet landons home as i had told her i would
they must not know what i had done but it was
inevitable that martell would know when he got back
to his infernal television and radio he must not
get back well time enough to plan that later
now to the work of seeing no 

  when i turned the dial of no  for as i have
stated before this was a dial instead of a lever i
was conscious of a peculiar sensation of distance
it fairly took my breath away what remote part
of the earths surface would the last position reveal
to me

  a sharp hissing sound accompanied the manipu-
lation of no  and the vaporous shroud was very
slow in taking definite shape when it was finally
at rest and it was apparent that it would not change
further the scene depicted was at first incompre-
hensible to me i stared with bulging eyes and
bated breath trying to read any meaning into the
combinations of form and color that had taken shape
before me

  in the light of what has since occurred the facts
of which are known throughout the world i can
lend my description a little intelligence borrowed
as it were from the future at the time of which
i write however no such enlightenment was mine
and it must have been a matter of minutes before
the slightest knowledge of the significance of the
scene entered my uncomprehending brain

  my vantage-point seemed to be slightly aerial for
i was looking down upon a scene possibly fifty feet
below me arid red cliffs and promontories jutted
over dry ravines and crevices in the immediate
foreground and also across a deep gully extended a
comparatively level area which was the scene of
some sort of activity there was about it a vague
suggestion of a shipyard yet i saw no lumber only
great mountainous piles of dull metal among which
moved thousands of agile figures they were men
and women but how strange they appeared their
red bodies were minus clothing of any description
and their heads and shoulders were covered with
long white feathers that when folded draped the
upper portions of their bodies like shawls they
were unquestionably of the same race as the desert-
island stranger-and martell at times the feath-
ers of these strange people stood erect and spread
out like a peacocks tail i noticed that when spread

in this fan-like fashion they facilitated locomotion

  i glanced toward the sun far to my right and
wondered if i had gone crazy i rubbed my hands
across my eyes and peered again yes it was our
luminary but it was little more than half its cus-
tomary size i watched it sinking with fascinated
gaze it vanished quickly beyond the red horizon
and darkness descended with scarcely a moment of
intervening twilight it was only by the closest ob-
servation that i could perceive that i was still in
communication with no 

  presently the gloom was dissipated by a shaft of
light from the opposite horizon whither the sun had
disappeared so rapidly that i could follow its
movement across the sky the moon hove into view
but wait was it the moon its surface looked
strangely unfamiliar and it too seemed to have
shrunk in size

  spellbound  watched the tiny moon glide across
the heavens the while  iistened to the clang of
metal tools from the workers below again a bright
light appeared on the horizon beyond the great metal
bulks below me the scene was rapidly being ren-
dered visible by an orb that exceeded the sun in
diameter then i knew great god there were
two moons traversing the welkin my heart was
pounding so loudly that it drowned out the sound of
the metal-workers i watched on unconscious of
the passage of time

  voices shouted from below in great excitement
events were evidently working up to some impor-
tant climax while the little satellite passed from my
line of vision and only the second large moon occu-
pied the sky straight before me and low on the
horizon it hung with its lower margin touching the
cliffs it was low enough now so that a few of the
larger stars were becoming visible one in par-
ticular attracted my gaze and held it it was a great
bluish-green star and i noticed that the workers
paused seemingly to gaze in silent admiration at its
transcendent beauty then shout after shout arose
from below and i gazed in bewilderment at the
spectacle of the next few minutes or was it hours 

  a great spherical bulk hove in view from the right
of my line of vision it made methink of nothing
so much as a gyroscope of gigantic proportions it
seemed to be made of the metal with which the
workers were employed below and as it gleamed in
the deep blue of the sky it looked like a huge satel-
lite a band of red metal encircled it with points of
the same at top and bottom numerous openings
that resembled the port-holes of an ocean-liner ap-
peared in the broad central band from which ex-
tended metal points i judged these were the eyes
of the machine but that which riveted my atten-
tion was an object that hung poised in the air below
the mighty gyroscope held in suspension by some
mysterious force probably magnetic in nature evi-
dently controlled in such a manner that at a certain
point it was exactly counter-balanced by the gravi-
tational pull the lines of force apparently traveled
from the poles of the mammoth sphere but the
object that depended in mid-air as firm and rigid as
though resting on terra-firma was the missing
pegasus the epitome of earthly scientific skill but
in the clutches of this unearthly looking marauder it
looked like a fragile toy its wings were bent and
the fate of the poseidonia



twisted giving it an uncanny resemblance to a bird
in the claws of a cat

  in my spellbound contemplation of this new phe-
nomenon i had temporarily forgotten the scene be-
low but suddenly a great cloud momentarily blotted
out the moon then another and another and another
in rapid succession huge bulks of air-craft were
eclipsing the moon soon the scene was all but ob-
literated by the machines whose speed accelerated
as they reached the upper air on and on they sped
in endless procession while the green star gazed
serenely on the green star most sublime of the
starry host i loved its pale beauty though i knew
not why darkness the moon had set but i knew
that still those frightfully gigantic and ominous
shapes still sped upward and onward whither

  the tiny moon again made its appearance serving
to reveal once more that endless aerial migration
was it hours or days i had lost all sense of the
passage of time the sound of rushing feet suc-
ceeded by a pounding at the door brought me back
to my immediate surroundings i had the presence
of mind to t shut off the machine then i arose and
assumed a defensive attitude as the door opened and
many figures confronted me foremost among them
was martell his face white with rage or was it
fear

  officers seize that man he cried furiously i
did not give him permission to spy in my room he
lied when he said that here martell turned to the
desk clerk who stood behind two policemen

  speaking of spying i flungback at him mar-
tel you ought to know the meaning of that word
hes a spy himself i cried to the two apparently
unmoved officers why he-he-

  from their unsympathetic attitudes i knew the
odds were against me i had lied arid i had been
found in a mans private rooms without his permis-
sion it would be a matter of time and patience be-
fore i could persuade the law that i had any justice
on my side

  i was handcuffed and led toward the door jiftt as
a sharp pain like an icy clutch at my heart overcame
me i sank into oblivion

v

ttthen i regained consciousness two days later
w i discovered that i was the sole occupant of a
cell in the state hospital for the insane mortified
to the extreme i pled with the keeper to bring
about my release assuring him that i was unim-
paired mentally

  sure thats what they all say the fellow re-
marked with a wry smile

  but i must be freed i reiterated impatiently
i have a message of importance for the world i
must get into immediate communication with the
secretary of war

  yes yes agreed th keeper affably well let
you see the secretary of war when that fellow over
there he jerked his thumb in the direction of the
cell opposite mine dies from drinking hemlock he
says hes socrates and every time he drinks a cup
of milk he flops over but he always revives

  i looked across the narrow hall into a pair of eyes
that mirrored a deranged mind then my gaze turned

to the guard who was watching me narrowly i
turned away with a shrug of despair

  later in the day the man appeared again but i
sat in sullen silence in a corner of my cell days
passed in this manner until at last a plausible means
of communication with the outside world occurred to
me i asked if my good friend professor stearns
might be permitted to visit me the guard replied
that he believed it could be arranged for sometime
the following week it is a wonder i did not become
demented imprisoned as i was in solitude with
the thoughts of the mysterious revelations haunting
me continually

  one afternoon the keeper passing by on one of his
customary rounds thrust a newspaper between the
bars of my cell i grabbed it eagerly and retired
to read it

  the headlines smote my vision with an almost
tactile force

  second mysterious recession of ocean the
poseidonia is lost

  i continued to read the entire article the letters
of which blazed before my eyes like so many pin-
points of light

  ocean waters have again receded this time in
the atlantic seismologists are at a loss to explain
the mysterious cataclysm as no earth tremors have
been registered it is a little over three months
since the supposed submarine fissures lowered the
level of the pacific ocean several feet and now the
same calamity only to a greater extent has visited
the atlantic

  the island of madeira reports stranded fish upon
her shores by the thousands the decay of which
threatens the health of the islands population two
merchant vessels off the azores and one fifty miles
out from gibraltar were found total wrecks an-
other the transatlantia reported a fearful agita-
tion of the ocean depths but seemed at a loss for a
plausible explanation as the sky was cloudless and
no wind was blowing

   but despite this fact wired the transatlantia
great waves all but capsized us this marine dis-
turbance lasted throughout the night

  the following wireless from the great ocean
liner poseidonia brings home to us the realization
that earth has been visited with a stupendous ca-
lamity the poseidonia was making her weekly
transatlantic trip betweert europe and america
and was in mid-ocean at the time her message was
flashed to the world

   a great cloud of flying objects of enormous pro-
portions has just appeared in the sky blotting out
the light of the stars no sound accompanies the
approach of this strange fleet in appearance the
individual craft resemble mammoth balloons the
sky is black with them and in their vicinity the air
is humid and oppressive as though the atmosphere
were saturated to the point of condensation every-
thing is orderly there are no collisions our cap-
tain has given orders for us to turn back toward
europe-we have turned but the dark dirigibles are
pursuing us their speed is unthinkable can the
poseidonia doing a mere hundred miles an hour
escape a huge craft is bearing down upon us
from above and behind there is no escape pan-
demonium reigns the enemy-


amazing stories

  thus ends the tragic message from the brave
wireless operator of the poseidonia

  i threw down the paper and called loudly for the
keeper socrates across the hall eyed me suspi-
ciously i was beginning to feel that perhaps the
poor demented fellow had nothing on me that i
should soon be in actuality a raving maniac

  the keeper came in response to my call entered
my cell and patted my shoulders reassuringly

  never mind old top he said it isnt so bad as
it seems

  now look here i burst forth angrily i tell
you i am not insane how futile my words
soynded if you will send professor mortimer
stearns teacher of astronomy at austin to me at
once for an hours talk ill prove to the world that
i have not been demented

  professor stearns is a very highly esteemed
friend of mine i continued noting the suspicion
depicted on his countenance- if you wish go to
him first and find out his true opinion of me ill
wager it will not be an uncomplimentary one
the man twisted his keys thoughtfully and i
uttered not a word believing a silent demeanor most
effective in the present crisis after what seemed
an eternity 

  all right he said ill see what can be done
toward arranging a visit from professor mortimer
stearns as soon as possible

  i restrained my impulse toward a too effusive ex-
pression of gratitude as i realized that a quiet dig-
nity prospered my cause more effectually

  the next morning at ten after a constant vigil i
was rewarded with the most welcome sight of pro-
fessor stearns striding down the hall in earnest con-
versation with the guard he was the straw and i
the drowning man but would he prove a more sub-
stantial help than the proverbial straw i surely
hoped so

  a chair was brought for the professor and placed
just outside my cell i hastily drew my own near it

  well this is indeed unfortunate said mortimer
stearns with some embarrassment and i sincerely
hope you will soon be released

  unfortunate i echoed it is nothing short of
a calamity

  my indignation voiced so vociferously startled the
good professor and he shoved his chair almost im-
perceptibly away from the intervening bars at the
far end of the hall the keeper eyed me suspiciously
hang it all was my last resort going to fail me

  professor stearns i said earnestly will you
try to give me an unbiased hearing my situation
is a desperate one and it is necessary for some one
to believe in me before i can render humanity the
service it needs

  he responded to my appeal with something of his
old sincerity that always endeared him to his asso-
ciates

  i shall be glad to hear your story gregory and
if i can render any service ill not hesitate-
thats splendid of you i interrupted with emo-
tion and now to my weird tale

  i related from the beginning omitting no details
however trivial they may have seemed the series of
events that had brought me to my present predica-
ment

  and your conclusion queried the professor in
strange hollow tones

  that martian spies one of whom is martell are
superintending by radio and television an unbe-
lieveably well-planned theft of earths water in
order to replenish their own dry ocean beds

  stupendous j gasped professor stearns some-
thing must be done to prevent another raid lets
see he mused the interval was three months be-
fore was it not three months we shall have for
bringing again into use the instruments of war
that praise god have lain idle for many genera-
tions it is the only way to deal with a formidable
foe from outside

     vi	i

professor stearns was gone but there
l was hope in my heart in place of the former
grim despair when the guard handed the eve-
ning paper to me i amazed him with a grate-
ful thank you but my joy was short-lived star-
ing up at me from the printed passenger-list of the
ill-fated poseidonia were the names of mr and mrs
t m landon and daughter margaret

  i know the guard classed me as one of the worst
cases on record but i felt that surely fate had-been
unkind

  a package for mr george gregory bawled a
voice in the corridor

  thanks to the influence of professor stearns i
was permitted to receive mail when the guard saw
that i preferred unwrapping it myself he discreetly
left me to the mystery of the missive

  a card just inside bore the few but insignificant
words for gregory in remembrance of martell

  i suppressed an impulse to dash the accursed
thing to the floor when i saw that it was martells
radio and television instrument placing it upon
the table i drew a chair up to it and turned each of
the levers but not one functioned i manipulated
the dial no  the action was accompanied by the
same hissing sound that had so startled my over-
wrought nerves upon the previous occasion slowly
the wraithlike mist commenced the process of ad-
justment spellbound i watched the scene before
my eyes

  again i had the sensation of a lofty viewpoint it
was identical with the one i had previously held but
the scene-was it the same it must be-mid yet
the barren red soil was but faintly visible through
a verdure the towering rocky palisades that bor-
dered the chasm were crowned with golden-roofed
dwellings or were they temples for they were like
the pure marble fanes of the ancient greeks except
in color down the steep slopes flowed streams of
sparkling water that dashed with a merry sound to
a canal below

  gone were the thousands of beings and their metal
aircraft but seated on a grassy plot in the left fore-
ground of the picture was a small group of the
white-feathered red-skinned inhabitants of this
strange land in the distance rose the temple-
crowned crags one figure alone stood and with a
magnificent gesture held arms aloft the great
corona of feathers spread following the line of the
arms like the open wings of a great eagle the

my fate	

 my name is edward ---
george eden i was born
at trentham in stafford-

employed in the gardens
there i lost my mother
when i was three years
old and my father when
i was five my uncle

george eden then adopt-

was a single man self-
educated and well-known
in birmingham as an

enterprising journalist he educated me gen-
erously fired my ambition to succeed in the
world and at his death which happened
four years ago left me his entire fortune
a matter of about five hundred pounds after

all outgoing charges were paid i was then eighteen
he advised me in his will to expend the money in
completing my education i had already chosen the
profession of medicine and through his posthumous
generosity and my good fortune in a scholarship
competition i became a medical student at univer-

wbwwwwi the time of the begin-

        present our readers with a real mystery story
 and perhaps one of the strangest you have ever
 read incidentally it is this story we believe that laid
 the basis of the plot for station x by w-insor mac-
 leod we do not know whether mr macleod ever
 read the story of the late mr elvesham but the
 coincidences in the two stories in places are certainly
 close where the martians in the macleod story ac-
 complished certain results by hypnotism wells gets sim-
 ilar results by means of drugs we believe mr wells
 wrote this story before mr macleod wrote his and
 the story will make a profound impression upon you
 due to its unusual and extraordinary plot

ning of my story i lodged
at a university street
in a little upper room
very shabbily furnished
and draughty overlooking
the back of shoolbreds
premises i used this
little room both to live in
and sleep in because i
was anxious to eke out
my means to the very last
shillings worth

  i was taking a pair of
shoes to be mended at a shop in the tottenham
court road when i first encountered the little old
man with the yellow face with whom my life has

   one of the great london department stores




amazing stories

now become so inextricably entangled he was
standing at the curb and staring at the number on
the door in a doubtful way as i opened it his
eyes-they werr dull gray eyes and reddish under
the rims-fell to my face and his countenance im-
mediately assumed an expression of corrugated
amiability

  you come he said apt to the moment i had
forgotten the number of your house how do you
do mr eden

  i was a little astonished at his familiar address
for i had never set eyes on the man before i was
a little annoyed too at his catching me with my
boots under my arm he noticed my lack of cor-
diality

  wonder who the deuce i am eh a friend let me
assure you i have seen you before though you
havent seen me is there anywhere where i can
talk to you

  i hesitated the shabbiness of my room upstairs
was not a matter for every stranger perhaps
said i we might walk down the street im un-
fortunately prevented- my gesture explained

the sentence before i had spoken it

  the very thing he said and faced this way and
thenthat the street which way shall we go
i slipped my boots down in the passage look
here he said abruptly this business of mine is a
rigmarole come and lunch with me mr eden im
an old man a very old man and not good at ex-
planations and what with my piping voice and the

clatter of the traffic-

  he laid a persuasive skinny hand that trembled a
little upon my arm

  i was not so old that an old man might not treat
me to a lunch yet at the same time i was not alto-
gether pleased by this abrupt invitation i had

rather- i began but i had rather he said

catching me up and a certain civility is surely due
to my gray hairs	t

  and so i consented and went with him

  he took me to blavitiskis i had to walk slowly
to accommodate myself to his paces and over such
a lunch as i had never tasted before he fended off
my leading question and i took a better note of his
appearance his clean-shaven face was lean and
wrinkled his shrivelled lips fell over a set of false
teeth and his white hair was thin and rather long
he seemed small to me-though indeed most people
seemed small to me-and his shoulders were rounded
and bent and watching him i could not help but
observe that he too was taking note of me running
his eyes with a curious touch of greed in them over
me from my broad shoulders to my sun-tanned
hands and up to my freckled face again and
now said he as we lit our cigarettes i will tell
you of the business in hand

  i must tell you then that i am an old man a
very old man he paused momentarily and it
happens that i have money that i must presently be
leaving and never a child have i to leave it to i
thought of the confidence game and resolved i would
be on the alert for the vestiges of my five hundred
pounds he proceeded to enlarge on his loneliness
and the trouble he had to find a proper disposition
of his money i have weighed this plan and that
plan charities institutions and scholarships and

libraries and i have come to this conclusion at last
-he fixed his eyes on my face-that i will find
some young fellow ambitious pure-minded and
poor healthy in body and healthy in mind and in
short make him my heir give him all that i have
he repeated give him all that i have so that he
will suddenly be lifted out of all the trouble and
struggle in which his sympathies have been edu-
cated to freedom and influence

  i tried to seem disinterested with a transparent
hypocrisy i said and you want my help my pro-
fessional services maybe to find that person

  he smiled and looked at me over his cigarette
and i laughed at his quiet exposure of my modest
pretense

  what a career such a man might have he said
it fills me with envy to think how i have accumu-
lated that another man may spend-

  but there are conditions of course burdens to
be imposed he must for instance take my name
you cannot expect everything without some return
and i must go into all the circumstances of his life
before i can accept him he must be sound i must
know his heredity how his parents and grandpar-
ents died have the strictest inquiries made into his
private morals

  this modified my secret congratulations a little

  and do i understand said i that i-

  yes he said almost fiercely you you

  i answered never a word my imagination was
dancing wildly my innate scepticism was useless to
modify its transports there was not a particle of
gratitude in my mind-i did not know what to say
nor how to say it but why me in particular i
said at last

  he had chanced to hear of me from professor
haslar he said as a typically sound and sane young
man and he wished as far as possible to leave his
money where health and integrity were assured

phat was my first meeting with the little old
a man he was mysterious about himself he
would not give his name yet he said and after i
had answered some questions of his he left me at
the blavitiski portal i noticed that he drew a hand-
ful of gold coins from his pocket when it came to
paying for the lunch his insistence upon bodily
health was curious in accordance with an arrange-
ment we had made i applied that day for a life pol-
icy in the loyal insurance company for a large sum
and i was exhaustively overhauled by the medical
advisers of that company in the subsequent week
even that did not satisfy him and he insisted i
must be re-examined by the great doctor henderson

  it was friday in whitsun week before he came
to a decision he called me down quite late in the
evening-nearly nine it was-from cramming chem-
ical equations for my preliminary scientific exam-
ination he was standing in the passage under the
feeble gas-lamp and his face was a grotesque inter-
play of shadows he seemed more bowed than when
i had first seen him and his cheeks had sunk in a
little

  his voice shook with emotion everything is
satisfactory mr eden he said everything is
quite quite satisfactory and this night of all
nights you must dine with me and celebrate your
the story of the late mr elvesham



 -accession he was interrupted by a cough
 you wont nave long to wait either he said
 wiping his handkerchief across his lips and grip-
 ping my hand with his long bony claw that was dis-
 engaged certainly not very long to wait

   we went into the street and called a cab i re-
 member every incident of that drive vividly the
 swift easy motion the vivid contrast of gas and
 oil and electric light the crowds of people in the
 streets the place in regent street to which we
 went and the sumptuous dinner we were served
 with there i was disconcerted at first by the well-
 dressed waiters glances at my rough clothes both-
 ered by the stones of the olives but as the cham-
 pagne warmed my blood my confidence revived
 at first the old man talked of himself he had
 already told me his name in the cab he was egbert
 elvesham the great philosopher whose name i had
 known since i was a lad at school it seemed in-
 credible to me that this man whose intelligence
 had so early dominated mine this great abstrac-
 tion should suddenly realize itself as this decrepit
 familiar figure i dare say every young fellow
 who has suddenly fallen among celebrities has felt
 something of my disappointment he told me now
 of the future that the feeble streams of his life
 would presently leave dry for me houses copy-
 rights investments i had never suspected that
 philosophers were so rich he watched me eat and
 drink with a touch of envy what a capacity for
 living you have he said and then with a sigh
 a sigh of relief i could have thought it it will
 not be long

   ay said i my head swimming now with cham-
 pagne i have a future perhaps-of a passing
 agreeable sort thanks to you i shall now have the
 honor of your name but you have a past such
 a past as is worth all my future

   he shook his head andsmiled as i thought with
 half sad appreciation of my flattering admiration
 that future he said would you in truth change
 it the waiter came with liqueurs you will
 hot perhaps mind taking my name taking my
 position but would you indeed-willingly-take
 my years

   with your achievements said i gallantly

   he smiled again kummel-both he said to
 the waiter and turned his attention to a little paper
 packet he had taken from his pocket this hour
 said he this after-dinner hour is the hour of
 small things here is a scrap of my unpublished
 wisdom he opened the packet with his shaking
 yellow fingers and showed a little pinkish powder
 on the paper this said he-well you must
 guess what it is but kummel-put a dash of this
 powder in it-is himmel

   his large grayish eyes watched mine with an in-
 scrutable expression

   it was a bit of a shock to me to find this great
 teacher gave his mind to the flavor of liqueurs
 however i feigned an interest in his weakness
  for i was drunk enough for such small sycophancy
 he parted the powder between the little glasses
 ancl rising suddenly with a strange unexpected
 dignity held out his hand towards me i imitated
 his action and the glasses rang to a quick suc-

 cession said he and raised his glass towards his
 lips

  not that i said hastily not that

  he paused witn the liqueur at the level of his
chin and his eyes blazing into mine

  to a long life said i

  he hesitated to a long life said he with a
sudden bark of laughter and with eyes fixed on
one another we tilted the little glasses his eyes
looked straight into mine and as i drained the
stuff off i felt a curiously intense sensation the
first touch of it set my brain in a furious tumult
i seemed to feel an actual physical stirring in my
skull and a seething humming filled my ears i
did not notice the flavor in my mouth the aroma
that filled my throat i saw only the gray intensity
 his gaze that burnt into mine the draught
the mental confusion the noise and stirring in my
head seemed to last an interminable time curi-
ous vague impressions of half-forgotten things
danced and vanished on the edge of my conscious-
ness at last he broke the spell with a sudden
explosive sigh he put down his glass

  well he said

  its glorious said i though i had not tasted
the stuff

  my head was spinning i sat down my brain
was chaos then my perception grew clear and
minute as though i saw things in a concave mir-
ror his manner seemed to have changed into
something nervous and hasty he pulled out his
watch and grimaced at it eleven-seven and
to-night i must-seven-twenty-five waterloo
i must go at once he called for the bill and
struggled with his coat officious waiters came to
our assistance in another moment i was wishing
him good-bye over the apron of a cab and still
with an absurd feeling of minute distinctness as
though-how can i express it-i not only saw
but felt through an inverted opera-glass

  that stuff he said he put his hand to his
forehead i ought not to have given it to you it
will make your head split to-morrow wait a min-
ute here he handed me out a little flat thing
like a seidlitz powder take that in water as you
are going to bed the other thing was a drug
not till youre ready to go to bed mind it will

clear your head thats all one more shake

futurus

  i gripped his shrivelled claw good-bye he
said and by the droop of his eyelids i judged he
too was a little under the influence of that brain-
twisting cordial

  he recollected something else with a start felt
in his breast-pocket and produced another packet
this time a cylinder the size and shape of a shav-
ing-stick here said he id almost forgotten
dont open this until i come tomorrow-but take
it now

  it was so heavy that i wellnigh dropped it all
ri said i and he grinned at me through the cab
window as the cabman flicked his horse into wake-
fulness it was a white packet he had given me
with red seals at either end and along its edge
if this isnt money said i its platinum or lead

 stuck it with elaborate care into my pocket
and with a whirling brain walked home through
the regent street loiterers and the dark back
streets beyond portland road i remember the
sensations of that walk very vividly strange as
they were i was still so far myself that i could
notice my strange mental state and wonder
whether this stuff i had had was opium-a drug
beyond my experience it is hard now to describe
the peculiarity of my mental strangeness-mental
doubling vaguely expresses it as i was walking
up regent street i found in my mind a queer per-
suasion that it was waterloo station and had an
odd impulse to get into the polytechnic as a man
might get into a train i put a knuckle in my eye
and it was regent street how can i express it
you see a skilful actor looking quietly at you he
pulls a grimace and lo-another person is it
too extravagant if i tell you that it seemed to me
as if regent street had for the moment done that
then being persuaded it was regent street again
i was oddly muddled about some fantastic rem-
iniscences that cropped up thirty years ago
thought i it was here that i quarrelled with my
brother then i burst out laughing to the as-
tonishment and encouragement of a group of night
prowlers thirty years ago i did not exist and
never in my life had i boasted a brother the
stuff was surely liquid folly for the poignant re-
gret for that lost brother still clung to me along
portland road the madness took another turn i
began to recall vanished shops and to compare the
street with what it used to be confused troubled
thinking is comprehensible enough after the drink
i had taken but what puzzled me were these curi-
ously vivid phantasm memories that had crept into
my mind and not only the memories that had crept
in hut also the memories that had slipped out i
stopped opposite stevenss the natural history
dealers and cudgelled my brains to think what he
had to do with me a bus went by and sounded
exactly like the rumbling of a train i seemed to
be dipping into some dark remote pit for the recol-
lection of course said i at last he has prom-
ised me three frogs tomorrow odd i should have
forgotten

  do they still show children dissolving views  in
those i remember one view would begin like a faint
ghost and grow and oust another in just that
way it seemed to me that a ghostly set of new sen-
sations was struggling with those of my ordinary
self

  i went on through euston road to tottenham
court road puzzled and a little frightened and
scarcely noticed the unusual way i was taking for
commonly i used to cut through the intervening
network of back streets i turned into university
street to discover that i had forgotten my number
only by a strong effort did i recall  a and even
then it seemed to me that it was a thing some for-
gotten person had told me i tried to steady my
mind by recalling the incidents of the dinner and
for the life of me i could conjure up no picture of
my hosts face i saw him only as a shadowy out-
line as one might see oneself reflected in a win-
dow through which one was looking in his place
however i had  curious exterior vision of myself

sitting at a table flushed bright-eyed and talk-
ative

  i must take this other powder said i this is
getting impossible

  i tried the wrong side of the hall for my candle
and the matches and had a doubt of which landing
my room might be ori im drunk i said thats
certain and blundered needlessly on the staircase
to sustain the proposition

  at the first glance my room seemed unfamiliar
what rot i said and stared about me i seemed
to bring myself back by the effort and the odd
phantasmal quality passed into the concrete famil-
iar there was the old glass still with my notes
on the albumens stuck in the corner of the frame
my old everyday suit of clothes pitched about the
floor and yet it was not so real after all i felt
an idiotic persuasion trying to creep into my mind
as it were that i was in a railway carriage in a
train just stopping that i was peering out of the
window at some unknown station i gripped the
bed-rail firmly to reassure myself its clairvoy-
ance perhaps i said i must write to the psychi-
cal research society

  i put the rouleau on my dressing-table sat on
my bed and began to take off my boots it was
as if the picture of my present sensations was
painted over some other picture that was trying to
show through curse it said i my wits are
going or am i in two plaices at once half-un-
dressed i tossed the powder into a glass and drank
it off it effervesced and became a fluorescent am-
ber color before i was in bed my mind was al-
ready tranquillized i felt the pillow at my cheek
and thereupon i must have fallen asleep

t awoke abruptly out of a dream of strange
l beasts and found myself lying on my back
probably everyone knows that dismal emotional
dream from which one escapes awake indeed but
strangely cowed there was a curious taste in my
mouth a tired feeling in my limbs a sense of cu-
taneous discomfort i lay with my head motion-
less on my pillow expecting that my feeling of
strangeness and terror would pass away and that
i should then doze off again to sleep but instead
of that my uncanny sensations increased at first
i could perceive nothing wrong about me there
was a faint light in the room so faint that it was
the very next thing to darkness and the furniture
stood out in it as vague blots of absolute darkness
i stared with my eyes just over the bedclothes

  it came into my mind that some one had entered
the room to rob me of my rouleau of money but
after lying for some moments breathing regularly
to simulate sleep i realized this was mere fancy
nevertheless the uneasy assurance of something
wrong kept fast hold of me with an effort i raised
my head from the pillow and peered about me at
the dark what it was i could not conceive i
looked at the dim shapes around me the greater
and lesser darknesses that indicated curtains table
fireplace bookshelves and so forth then i began
to perceive something unfamiliar in the forms of
the darkness had the bed turned round yon-
der should be the bookshelves and something
shrouded and pallid rose there something that
would not answer to the bookshelves however i
the story of the late mr elvesham



looked at it it was far too big to be my shirt
thrown on a chair

  overcoming a childish terror i threw back the
bed-clothes and thrust my leg out of bed instead
of coming out of my truckle-bed upon the floor i
found my foot scarcely reached the edge of the mat-
tress i made another step as it were and sat up
on the edge of the bed by the side of my bed
should be the candle and the matches upon the
broken chair i put out my hand and touched-
nothing i waved my hand in the darkness and it
came against some heavy hanging soft and thick
in texture which gave a rustling noise at my touch
i grasped this and pulled it it appeared to be a
curtain suspended over the head of my bed

  i was now thoroughly awake and beginning to
realize that i was in a strange room i was puz-
zled i tried to recall the overnight circumstances
and i found them now curiously enough vivid in
my memory the supper my reception of the little
packages my wonder whether i was intoxicated
my slow undressing the coolness to my flushed face
of my pillow i felt a sudden distrust was that
last night or the night before at any rate this
room was strange to me and i could not imagine
how i had got into it the dim pallid outline was
growing paler and i perceived it was a window
with the dark shape of an oval toilet-glass against
the weak intimation of the dawn that filtered
through the blind i stood up and was surprised
by a curious feeling of weakness and unsteadiness
with trembling hands outstretched i walked slowly
towards the window getting nevertheless a bruise
on the knee from a chair by the way i fumbled
round the glass which was large with handsome
brass sconces to find the blind-cord i could not
find any by chance i took hold of the tassel and
with the click of a spring the blind ran up

  i found myself looking out upon a scene that
was altogether strange to me the night was over-
cast and through the flocculent gray of the heaped
clouds there filtered a faint half-light of dawn
just at the edge of the sky the cloud-canopy had a
blood-red rim below everything was dark and
indistinct dim hills in the distance a vague mass
of buildings running up into pinnacles trees like
spilt ink and below the window a tracery of black
bushes and pale gray paths it was so unfamiliar
that for the moment i thought myself still dream-
ing i felt the toilet-table it appeared to be made
of some polished wood and was rather elaborately
furnished-there were little cut-glass bottles and
a brush upon it there was also a queer little ob-
ject horse-shoe shape it felt with smooth hard
projections lying in a saucer i could find no
matches or candlestick

  i turned my eyes to the room again now the
blind was up faint spectres of its furnishing came
out of the darkness there was a huge curtained
bed and the fireplace at its foot had a large white
mantel with something of the shimmer of marble

  i leant against the toilet-table shut my eyes
and opened them again and tried to think the
whole thing was far too real for dreaming i was
inclined to imagine there was still some hiatus in
my memory as a consequence of my draught of
that strange liqueur that i had come into my in-
heritance perhaps and suddenly iost my recollec-

tion of everything since my good fortune had been
announced perhaps if i waited a little things
would be clearer to me again yet my dinner with
old elvesham was now singularly vivid and recent
the champagne the observant waiters the powder
and the liqueurs-i could have staked my soul it
all happened a few hours ago

  and then occurred a thing so trivial and yet so
terrible to me that i shiver now to think of that
moment i spoke aloud i said how the devil
did i get here    and the voice was not my
own

  it was not my own it was thin the articulation
was slurred the resonance of my facial bones was
different then to reassure myself i ran one hand
over the other and felt loose folds of skin the bony
laxity of age surely i said in that horrible
voice that had somehow established itself in my
throat surely this thing is a dream almost as
quickly as if i did it involuntarily i thrust my
fingers into my mouth my teeth had gone my
finger-tips ran on the flaccid surface of an even
row of shrivelled gums i was sick with dismay
and disgust

  i felt then a passionate desire to see myself to
realize at once in its full horror the ghastly change
that had come upon me i tottered to the mantel and
felt along it for matches as i did so a barking
cough sprang up in my throat and i clutched the
thick flannel nightdress i found about me there
were no matches there and i suddenly realized
that my extremities were cold sniffing and cough-
ing whimpering a little perhaps i fumbled back
to bed it is surely a dream i whispered to my-
self as i clambered back surely-a dream it was
a senile repetition i pulled the bedclothes over
my shoulders over my ears i thrust my withered
hand under the pillow and determined to compose
myself to sleep of course it was a dream in the
morning the dream would be over and i should
wake up strong and vigorous again to my youth
and studies i shut my eyes breathed regularly
and finding myself wakeful began to count slowly
through the powers of three

  but the thing i desired would not come i could
not get to sleep and the persuasion of the inex-
orable reality of the change that had happened to
me grew steadily presently i found myself with
my eyes wide open the powers of three forgotten
and my skinny fingers upon my shrivelled gums
i was indeed suddenly and abruptly an old man
i had in some unaccountable manner fallen through
my life and come to old age in some way i had
been cheated of all the best of my life of love of
struggle of strength and hope i grovelled into
the pillow and tried to persuade myself that such
hallucination was possible imperceptibly stead-
ily the dawn grew clearer

at last despairing of further sleep i sat up in
bed and looked about me a chill twilight ren-
dered the whole chamber visible it was spacious
and well-furnished better furnished than any room
i had ever slept in before a candle and jggtches
became dimly visible upon a little pedestaf iti p re-
cess i threw back the bedclothes and shivering
with the rawness of thjjahfcrning albeit it
was summer-time i got	lit the catrclle


amazing stories

then trembling horribly so that the extinguisher
rattled on its spike-i tottered to the glass and
saw-elveshams face it was none the less hor-
rible because i had already dimly feared as much
he had already seemed physically weak and pitiful
to me but seen now dressed only in a coarse flannel
nightdress that fell apart anj showed the stringy
neck seen now as my own body i cannot describe
its desolate decrepitude the hollow cheeks the
straggling tail of dirty gray hair the rheumy
bleared eyes the quivering shrivelled lips the
lower displaying a gleam of the pink interior lin-
ing and those horrible dark gums showing you
who are mind and body together at your natural
years cannot imagine what tjiis fiendish imprison-
ment meant to me to be young and full of the
desire and energy of youth and to be caught and
presently to be crushed in this tottering ruin of a
body   

  but i wander from the course of my story for
some time i must have been stunned at this change
that had come upon me it was daylight when i
did so far gather myself together as to think in
some inexplicable way i had been changed though
how short of magic the thing had been done i
could not say and as i thought the diabolical in-
genuity of elvesham came home to me it seemed
plain to me that as i found myself in his so he must
be in possession of my body of my strength that
is and my future but how to prove it then
as i thought the thing became so incredible even
to me that my mind reeled and i had to pinch
myself to feel my toothless gums to see myself in
the glass and touch the things about me before i
could steady myself to face the facts again was
all life hallucination was i indeed elvesham and
he me had i been dreaming of eden overnight
was there any eden but if i was elvesham i
should remember where i was on the previous
morning the name of the town in which i lived
what happened before the dream began i strug-
gled with my thoughts i recalled the queer double-
ness of my memories overnight but now my mind
was clear not the ghost of any memories but
those proper to eden could i raise

  this way lies insanity i cried in my piping
voice i staggered to my feet dragged my feeble
heavy limbs to the washhand-stand and plunged
my gray head into a basin of cold water then
towelling myself i tried again it was no good
i felt beyond all question that i was indeed eden
not elvesham but eden in elveshams body

  had i been a man of any other age i might have
given myself up to my fate as one enchanted but
in these sceptical days miracles do not pass cur-
rent here was some trick of psychology what a
drug and a steady stare could do a drug and a
steady stare or some similar treatment could sure-
ly undo men have lost their memories before but
to exchange memories as one does umbrellas i
laughed alas not a healthy laugh but a wheez-
ing senile titter i could have fancied old elve-
sham laughing at my plight and a gust of petulant
anger unusual to me swept across my feelings

i	began dressing eagerly in the clothes i found
lying about on the floor and realized when i was
dressed that it was an evening suit i had assumed

i	opened the wardrobe and found some ordinary
clothes a pair of plaid trousers and an old-fash-
ioned dressing-gown i put a venerable smoking-
cap on my venerable head and coughing a little
from my exertions tottered out upon the landing

  it was then perhaps a quarter to six and the
blinds were closely drawn and the house quite
silent the landing was a spacious one a broad
richly-carpeted staircase went down into the dark-
ness of the hall below and before me a door ajar
showed me a writing-desk a revolving bookcase
the back of a study chair and a fine array of bound
books shelf upon shelf

  my study i mumbled and walked across the
landing then at the sound of my voice a thought
struck me and i went back to the bedroom and put
in the set of false teeth they slipped in with the
ease of old habit thats better said  gnashing
them and so returned to the study

  the drawers of the writing-desk were locked
its revolving top was also locked i could see no
indications of the keys and there were none in the
pockets of my trousers i shuffled back at once to
the bedroom and went through the dress-suit and
afterwards the pockets of all the garments i could
find i was very eager and one might have imag-
ined that burglars had been at work to see my
room when i had done not only were there no
keys to be found but not a coin nor a scrap of
paper-save only the receipted bill of the overnight
dinner

  a curious weariness asserted itself i sat down
and stared at the garments flung here and there
their pockets turned inside out my first frenzy
had already flickered out every moment i was
beginping to realize the immense intelligence of the
plans of my enemy to see more and more clearly the
hopelessness of my position with an effort i rose
and hurried hobbling into the study again on the
staircase was a housemaid pulling up the blinds
she stared i think at the expression of my face

i	shut the door of the study behind me and seiz-
ing a poker began an attack upon the desk that
is how they found me the cover of the desk was
split the lock smashed the letters torn out of the
pigeon-holes and tossed about the room in my
senile rage i had flung about the pens and other
such light stationery and overturned the ink
moreover a large vase upon the mantel had got
broken i do not know how i could flnd no cheque-
book no money no indications of the slightest use
for the recovery of my body i was battering mad-
ly at the drawers when the butler backed by two
women-servants intruded upon me

tphat simply is the story of my change no one
j- will believe my frantic assertions i am treated
as one demented and even at this moment i am
under restraint but i am sane absolutely sane
and to prove iti have sat down to write this story
minutely as the things happened to me i appeal
to the reader whether there is any trace of insanity
in the style or method of the story he has been
reading i am a young man locked away in an old
mans body but the dear fact is incredible v
everyone naturally i appear demented to those
the story of the late mr elvesham



who will not believe this naturally i do not know
the names of my secretaries of the doctors who
come to see me of my servants and neighbors of
this town wherever it is where i find myself
naturally i lose myself in my own house and suf-
fer inconveniences of every sort naturally i ask
the oddest questions naturally i weep and cry
out and have paroxysms of despair i have no
money and no cheque-book the bank will not rec-
ognize my signature for i suppose that allowing
for the feeble muscles i now have my handwriting
is still edens these people about me will not let
me go to the bank personally it seems indeed
that there is no bank in this town and that i have
an account in some part of london it seems that
elvesham kept the name of his solicitor secret from
all his household i can ascertain nothing elve-
sham was of course a profound student of mental
science and all my declarations of the facts of the
case merely confirm the theory that my insanity is
the outcome of overmuch brooding upon psychol-
ogy dreams of the personal identity indeed two
days ago i was a healthy youngster with all life
before me now i am a furious old man unkempt
and desperate and miserable prowling about a
great luxurious strange house watched feared
and avoided as a lunatic by every one about me
and in london is elvesham beginning life again
in a vigorous body and with all the accumulated
knowledge and wisdom ofthreescore and ten he
has stolen my life

  what has happened i do not clearly know in
the study are volumes of manuscript notes refer-
ring chiefly to the psychology of memory and parts
of what may be either calculations or ciphers in
symbols absolutely strange to me in some pas-
sages there are indications that he was also occu-
pied with the philosophy of mathematics i take it
he has transferred the whole of his memories the
accumulation that makes up his personality from
this old withered brain of his to mine and simi-
larly that he has transferred mine to his discarded
tenement practically that is he has changed
bodies but how such a change may be possible
is without the range of my philosophy i have been
a materialist for all my thinking life but here sud-

denly is a clear case of mans detachability from
matter

  one desperate experiment i am about to try i
sit writing here before putting the matter to issue
this morning with the help of a table-knife that

i	had secreted at breakfast i succeeded in breaking
open a fairly obvious secret drawer in this wrecked
writing desk i discovered nothing save a little
green glass phial containing a white powder round
the neck of the phial was a label and thereon was
written this one word release this may be-is
most probably-poison i can understand elve-
sham placing poison in my way and i should be
sure that it was his intention so to get rid of the
only living witness against him were it not for this
careful concealment the man has practically
solved the problem of immortality save for the
spite of chance he will live in my body until it has
aged and then again throwing it aside he will as-
sume some other victims youth and strength
when one remembers his heartlessness it is ter-
rible to think of the ever-growing experience that
   how long has he been leaping from body to
body    but i tire of writing the powder ap-
pears to be soluble in water the taste is not un-
pleasant

  there the narrative found upon mr elveshams
desk ends his dead body lay between the desk and
the chair the latter had been pushed back prob-
ably by his last convulsions the story was writ-
ten in pencil and in a crazy hand quite unlike his
usual minute characters there remain only two
curious facts to record indisputably there was
some connection between eden and elvesham
since the whole of elveshams property was be-
queathed to the young man but he never in-
herited when elvesham committed suicide eden
was strangely enough already dead twenty-four
hours before he had been knocked down by a cab
and killed instantly at the crowded crossing at the
intersection of gower street and euston road so
that the only human being who could have thrown
light upon this fantastic narrative is beyond the
reach of questions without further comment i
leave this extraordinary matter to the readers in-
dividual judgment

the library of a small observatory
ro men were seated before a table
afore them was spread out a huge
lart upon which rested several large
id well thumbed star catalogues bear-
ing various dates and titles the elder of the two
men whose strikingly intellectual countenance in-
dicated a mind of no ordinary capacity and whose
age might have been anywhere between forty-five
and sixty was busily engaged in drawing geome-
trical diagrams and comparing his results with a
row of figures which lay before him his com-
panion a tall dark man still in the prime of life
was gazing anxiously at the outspread chart ap-
parently endeavoring to satisfy himself upon some
point of which he was uncertain anyone possess-
ing an elementary knowledge of astronomy would
at once have recognized it as a chart of the solar
system drawn upon a large scale and if his knowl-
edge of celestial mechanics extended a little further
he would have known the curious wavy lines about
the central part of the diagram to have been the
orbits of more than a hundred cometswhich had at
some time in the past visited the solar system

  presently the mathematician drew a mark upon
the chart dropped his pen and for a moment gazed
at his companion in amazement and wonder the
latter spoke at last it is true then this thing
which we had both expected and yet dared to hope
false are you sure there isnt still some possibility
of error in our calculations

  my friend replied the other suddenly rising
from his chair with an air of impatience the re-
sult of tonights work cannot be in error unless the
new science of mathematics to which i have devoted
twenty years of my life is false but perhaps you
doubt the truth of my
new system of cometary
geometry

  no said his compan-
ion eagerly i shall never
doubt that professor for
although an unbelieving
world refuses to recog-
nize the greatest mathe-
matical genius that has
lived upon this planet
since the time of new-
ton i jean bourget
humble star-gazer
and visionary though i am salute you in the name
of urania the immortal muse of astronomy never
since the first demonstration halve i doubted the
laws pf the new geometry have appeared to me as
inexorable as those of nature herself in short
dear master you have only to speak my part shall
be to listen to believe and to obey

  attend then to what i am about to relate re-
plied professor montesquieux for such was his
name you of course know that biela an officer
in the austrian army accidentally discovered a new
comet on the evening of february th  this
comet was carefully observed by contemporary as-
tronomers and it was soon assigned a period rang-
ing between six and seven years between  and
 it made two regular appearances but in the

  latter year it was seen to separate into two distinct
parts

  true to its old period the comet returned in
 but this time its components were over a mil-
lion miles apart then it disappeared but in
 after it had twice failed to reappear there
came from the very region of the cometary path one
of the most brilliant meteor showers ever recorded
in astronomical history klinkerfues of berlin as-
sumed this display to be due to a direct encounter
between the disintegrated comet and the earth
but strange to say the mysterious visitor was
shortly afterwards observed to be retreating to-
wards theta centauri in the southern heavens

  now the question was what had become of bie-
las comet where had it gone astronomers with
but the most crude and elementary mathematical
science at their command naturally were obliged
to accept a simple answer in fact all they had to
say was that the comet had conveniently disinte-
grated this explanation was simplicity itself and
who would be the wiser assuredly not the public
for were not the public always delighted with that
which least taxed their power of comprehension
consequently the memory of bielas comet has
died except in the minds of a few observers who
understand the meaning of the late november
meteor showers which occur at regular periodic in-
tervals coinciding with the former period of the
comet

  as montesquieux paused bourget asked and
these showers do not explain everything do they
offer no proof of the comets disintegration

  ah my friend resumed the professor rapidly
i perceive that you are but little acquainted with
the deeper mysteries of cometary geometry even
though your intentions are excellent proof indeed
what does the november meteor shower prove ex-
cept that this miserable
fragment of the great
comet continues to follow
the path of its ancient
ellipse showering the
earth with a few in-
finitesimal particles dur-
ing perihelion but i
tell you that is not the
real comet for the prin-
cipal part of biela
comet never disinte-
- grated and our learned
geometricians with their
play circles their hyperbolas their parabolas and
their curved planes what do they know about the
laws of cometary geometry do they think that
nature must necessarily follow their childish lines

i	alphonse montesquieux denounce them all they
have scorned ridiculed and rejected the laws i have
revealed but the day of reckoning is close at hand

  now listen to this when bielas comet divided
in  the smaller fragment continued in its old
course but the main body was deflected and
changed its orbit a real mathematician would
have perceived this during its last appearance in
 when the two nuclei were already over a mil-
lion miles apart but bielas comet is at last com-
ing back and it will strike the earth exactly wpon

 most of us have heard about comets but very few
 of us have ever seen one as is well known there
 has been a great deal of superstition about comets in the
 past and the most dire things have been predicted when
 one of them approached the earth sufficiently near to be-
 come visible to the naked eye in the past comets have
 been associated with pestilences wars and other great
 calamities much of this of course being based upon
 superstition the present story by our new author is
 excellent for any one who wants to brush up his knowl-
 edge of comets in general with a quantum of good fic-
 tion thrown in for good measure


amazing stories

the vernal equinox six months from today my cal-
culations cannot err i have mathematically de-
duced its greatly elongated orbit and proved the
point in which it must appear within a second of
arc talcing into account the speed of the earths
orbital revolution around the sun and the point
where the approaching comet must intercept the ter-
restrial orbit before reaching perihelion i find that
a collision is inevitable the earth which has re-
volved unmolested in space for perhaps a billion
years is at last to receive a sudden visitor

  and the result of this collision inquired bour-
get will be what many astronomers have held
that a comets mass is not sufficient to cause serious
damage to the earth but even if we were to pro-
claim this news from the press we should be doubt-
ed for as we have demonstrated this evening the
highest telescopic power is inadequate to reveal the
comets presence even though we know its right as-
cension and declination with certainty

  true replied montesquieux thoughtfully and
the nublic would not remember the wonder comet
of  which boguslawski observed to possess a
tail  miles in length and traveling at the
rate of  miles per second thus approaching
the speed of light itself neither would they re-
member the remarkable comet of lexell which
missed the earth by scarcely  miles on july

	 do you know what would have happened
if this comet had crossed the terrestrial orbit
twenty-two hours sooner the earth travels nine-
teen miles per second or  miles per hour a
period of twenty-two hours therefore represents ap-
proximately  miles-a narrow margin to
say the least-but with my comet or bielas comet
whichever you prefer to call it there will be no
such escape and do not think that comets are so
harmless as optimistic astronomers teach the
density of comets like that of planets varies with
age and chemical constitution the coming comet
possesses a nucleus of considerable density as its
attractive power and gravitational resistance clear-
ly prove all comets contain carbon hydrogen ni-
trogen and oxygen but the relative proportions in
which these elements are compounded are not
known consequently there can be no certainty re-
garding the effect of cometary gases upon terres-
trial atmosphere and organisms my opinion how-
ever is that these elements combined with a new
substance which i strongly suspect to exist within
comets would be absolutely fatal to organic life
based upon amorphous carbon the conclusion
therefore is evident terrestrial humanity is about
to come to an end even though the earth itself is
not totally destroyed

  bourget gazed at the professor for a moment in
silence finally he spoke i believe you i can-
not doubt but what is to be done

  our duty resumed montesquieux is to do all
that lies within our power to warn the public if
chemists could only be made to believe perhaps
even yet there might be time for the discovery of a
means of protection against the cometary gas
however i shall advise the press of my conclusion
tomorrow and in the interests of humanity i shall
again risk humiliation by applying for a hearing
before the national academy of science with
your assistance i shall at once draw up my report

which must be presented at the next meeting of the
academy ten days from this date

  a few moments later professor montesquieux
was rapidly dictating while bourget who acted in
the capacity of secretary wrote hurriedly upon a
paper which lay before him

preceding chapter the following account ap-
peared in the morning edition of la france

  paris oct -professor alphonse montes-
quieux long known as an eccentric mathematician
and astronomer has announced the startling news
that the earth is due for a sudden collision which
will occur upon the exact date of the vernal equinox
march   the professors amazing theory is
based upon the division of bielas comet which oc-
curred in  records show that the comet re-
appeared in  with its component parts already
 miles apart it has never been observed
since that date although some astronomers believe
that it was seen disappearing shortly after the
brilliant meteor shower of 

  the accepted theory has been that the comet
had disintegrated and this explanation is appar-
ently borne out by the meteor showers that are reg-
ularly received when the comets return is due
montesquieux however believes that the larger
portion of the comet was deflected and changed its
orbit into an elongated ellipse with a period of
seventy-eight years and by the aid of his new
cometary geometry a creation of his own he
claims to have demonstrated that the cometary path
exactly coincides with the earths position at the
vernal equinox

  we hasten to add that no corroboration of this
wild theory has been received from scientific au-
thorities upon receipt of the communication re-
porters were immediately sent to interview several
well-known astronomers residing in the city who
were unanimous in pronouncing the whole affair to
be either a crudely planned hoax or the creation of
a madman

  it is said tht montesquieuxs collaborator in
this investigation is one jean bourget an astron-
omer of doubtful standing and that the pair have
actually had the presumption to apply for a hear-
ing before the national academy of science those
acquainted with the professors previous activities
inform us that he was once accorded the privilege
of reading a paper upon his new geometry to the
same assembly but the whole proceeding was so
ludicrous that his hearers could not restrain them-
selves until the reading was over whereupon mon-
tesquieux retired in disgust vowing never to enter
the academy again there is little doubt that his
second request will be refused and there are al-
ready serious doubts regarding the professors
sanity
the lost comet



the day following this learned announcement
which was repeated in substance by the press
all over the continent dr beauvais president of
the french academy of science received the fol-
lowing communication

                   montesquieux observatory
                             october  

  sir-

    i address you not as one colleague to an-
  other but in the name of the french nation
  and humanity no other incentive could have
  moved me to the step i am taking two years
   ago i was publicly insulted by the august body
  which you represent i then vowed never to
  return but now i appeal for a hearing bielas
  comet is returning and the destruction of hu-
  manity is certain if preventive measures are
  not taken immediately your duty is clear
  there is no time to lose the proofs are in my
  possession and i shall expect an answer with-
  out delay

                     alphonse montesquieux

  now dr beauvais had already seen the an-
nouncement in the daily press and there was only
one sentence that had made a strong impression
upon his mind-that regarding tjje professors
sanity consequently when he had finished reading
the extraordinary letter which had just been de-
livered to him his countenance assumed a thought-
ful expression but his thoughts were far away
from bielas comet for he was thinking only of the
professor strange man he reflected a valu-
able brain gone mad and forever lost to science
but with his undeniably great scientific ability
what terrible destruction might he not be capable
of doing should his deranged fancy take another
turn should he be disappointed in his present
hallucination i fear he might take revenge by do-
ing incalculable damage to the nation and even to
humanity itself clearly something must be done
and a refusal would only augment his insanity and
leave him at large no he shall be admitted to the
academy but i will be prepared fifteen minutes
before a committee consisting of myself and the
leading astronomers of the nation will be sufficient
to test his absurd claims and show his derangement
and then i shall have a special council of alienists
prepared to examine him if the result be as i ex-
pect i will see that he is immediately confined in
an asylum for the -insane where he may propound
his theories in safety without danger to the public
peace

one week later the national academy of sci-
ence was in session true to his determina-
tion dr beauvais had called together the leading
astronomers and mathematicians of france and
professor montesquiex had been granted fifteen
minutes in which to present his theory to the
learned assembly the last speaker was just fin-
ishing his paper when he was done it would then
be the professors turn to speak

  dr beauvais was fully prepared upon his right
was seated henri valire director of the paris
observatory upon his left was ren beauchamp
the leading mathematician of france in an ante-
chamber of the building a selected group of mental

specialists was waiting professor montesquieux
accompanied by jean bourget was seated in a con-
spicuous position in the upper end of the hall

  at length the speaker concluded there was
silence the president rose fixed his eyes upon
the professor and proceeded in his most majestic
tone alphonse montesquieux you have applied
for a hearing before this assembly you have been
granted fifteen minutes in which to state your case
proceed

  professor montesquieux arose and without wast-
ing time upon formalities began

  gentlemen assuming two celestial objects
whose common parent moved in an ellipse to be the
results of an internal explosion what orbits would
they be most likely to follow you will remember
that in mathematical researches-upon the orbits of
asteroids it was universally assumed by astronom-
ers that in case the minor planets were the remain-
ing fragments of the ultra-martian planet required
by bodes law their orbits would at some time in
the past have intersected the point where the ex-
plosion occurred however as investigation proved
that such intersections had occurred only in rela-
tively few cases the existence of the hypothetical
planet was considered disproved

  in the point which i wish you to consider i ap-
peal to the same inexorable law of celestial me-
chanics when bielas comet divided in  the
same principle was involved in  when the
omet reappeared it was evident that the orbit of
each nucleus had been changed for the twin comets
were already  miles apart further proof
of this orbital change was furnished by the earths
collision with the disintegrated cometary fragment
in  we may assume however that as regards
celestial distances the orbit of this minor nucleus
continued virtually the same showering the earth
with its debris at regular periodic intervals

  but what became of the major nucleus and
above all what would have been the nature of its
orbit  some of you already know that so far as
celestial phenomena are concerned i conceive both
the parabola and the hyperbola to be physical and
mathematical impossibilities cometary geometry
allows of only one orbit-the ellipse so long as the
nucleus is free from serious gravitational perturba-
tion now in accordance with the theorem first
adduced it follows that the divided fragments of
bielas comet must eventually pass through a com-
mon point of intersection let aa represent the
diameter of the original ellipse let x be the point
upon the orbit where the comet divided into the
fragments b and c and you will find that c which
has the more elongated orbit must finally intersect
the path of b at x x gentlemen is the precise
point in space this planet will occupy at the vernal
fouinox next march a collision is inevitable the
mathematical proofs of this catastrophe are here
available for your inspection and i strongly urge
that suitable measures be taken to discover a means
of protecting humanity against the poisonous gases
which the impending collision will produce my
time is up i thank you

  at this point profedsor montesquieux walked to
the presidents chair handed him the report which
he had prepared and quickly resumed his -seat

  the impression produced upon the assembly by


amazing stories

the discourse they had just heard would be difficult
to describe but upon every countenance the same
expression was visible stupefaction wonder and
amazement were written clearly upon the face of
each member dr beauvais slowly took up the pa-
per and after a momentary glance handed the
sheet to the mathematician at his left

   this learned gentleman after scrutinizing the
 professors calculations with a puzzled air leaned
 confidentially toward the president mad he
 whispered these insane scribblings can be nothing
 else than the creations of a madman i refuse to
 consider the matter further if your measures are
 prepared i advise that you proceed with them im-
 mediately

   the professor had made a fatal error which could
 hardly have been avoided even if it had been fore-
 seen being a mathematical genius he had for
 years scorned the applied mathematics of his time
 and had evolved a new and revolutionary system
 from the realm of pure mathematics consequently
 his symbols although relatively simple were in-
 telligible only to himself and bourget indeed the
 conclusion which he had reached by the new method
 could not have been deduced or even expressed by
 ordinary mathematical symbols it was therefore
 i hardly surprising that a mathematician of the old
 school should utterly fail to grasp the meaning of
 the calculation professional pride however would
 i not permit this fact to be recognized and so like
 j many another innovator montesquieux was to pay
 dearly for his temerity

   the presidents features assumed a determined
 expression rising and beckoning to the professor
 he said monsieur montesquieux this matter must
 be discussed privately and at greater length will
 you have the kindness to follow me into the ad-
 joining room without suspecting the plot which
 had been laid against him the professor rose from
 his seat and followed dr beauvais out of the hall

   two hours later the name alphonse montesquieux
 was officially registered in a secluded institution
 for the insane which was located a few miles out-
 side of paris

iii

 in the latter part of february the astronomical
 world was on the qui vive on the twentieth
 of the month an english amateur astronomer
 named huntington had observed while walking
 home during the late hours of the evening a sight
 which caused him to stop short and gasp for breath
 in the constellation cassiopeiae within three degrees
 of the spot where tycho brahes famous temporary
 star had appeared in  was a brilliant nova al-
 ready of the second magnitude realizing that his
 long desired opportunity to make his name known
 in astronomical history had arrived the young man
 had rushed to the nearest telegraph station and hur-
 riedly written the following message to the green-
 wich observatory

            london february  
  second magnitude nova just ap-
  peared near kappa cassiopeia

                     huntington

that night telegraph lines and cables were kept

busy by communications among observatories all
over the world telescopes and spectroscopes were
immediately turned upon the nova and then a
startling thing occurred when the first large
telescope was directed toward the new star the as-
tronomer rubbed his eyes in bewilderment for in-
stead of showing as a mere bright point of light as
stars generally do the diameter of this strange ob-
ject increased tenfold when viewed through the
telescope an examination of the novas spectra re-
vealed another puzzling peculiarity the majority
of novae are either of solar type a or b-that is to
say white or blue stars of small density but the
spectrum lines of nova cassiopeiae seemed to indi-
cate a solar type of class f or g although there
were many features which did not correspond with
the composition of these stars

  was the new visitor comet planet or star this
was the question which astronomers were every-
where endeavoring to answer although some of
the spectrum lines suggested a cometary nucleus no
definite coma or tail had been visible and in con-
sequence this explanation was abandoned the
theory of a new planet was entirely too fantastic
for consideration consequently the nova must be
a new type of star closely analogous to nova persei
of  which was surrounded by a luminous ring
nebula when a few days later the object was ob-
served to be increasing in size and encircled by a
nebulous halo this explanation was greatly
strengthened for did not the nebula in nova persei
expand in radius almost three seconds of arc per
day this theory was universally accepted by the
entire scientific world

  in the meantime some amateur astronomer of a
religious turn of mind had started the rumor that
the celestial visitor was nothing less than the star
of bethlehem returned to announce the coming of
the millennium which millions of eager souls had so
long been anxiously expecting it was in fact the
famous star seen by the magi  years before
and which had been observed in   and
again in  by the astronomer tycho brahe

  as the sensational always travels fastest and
makes the best news this wild rumor was given
wide circulation religious sects founded upon the
speedy approach of the millennium were in the
greatest excitement in such communities all work
was abandoned ascension robes were prepared and
frenzied prayer and exhortation became the order
of the day crowds of wild-eyed men and women
began to roam the streets chanting weird psalms
and entreating passers-by to repent fast and pray
in preparation for the approaching day of judg
ment

the effect of all this upon the public mind soon
became noticeable even conservative persona
were at last becoming nervous for the nova was
undeniably increasing in size and brightness in
spite of the cold large crowds of people could be
seen watching the strange star on every clear eve-
ning nearly three weeks had passed since the dis-
covery of the nova on february twentieth within
a few days it had passed from a second magnitude
star to a brilliance far exceeding that of sirius
astronomers were frankly puzzled each night
they expected to find a decrease in the novas mag-
the lost comet



nitude in accordance with the usual fluctuations of
novae however instead of declining its brilliance
steadily increased to obtain an accurate parallax
of the star required some little time and although
a few rough attempts had already been made the
results were far too startling to admit of serious
consideration

  in london the sky had been heavily overcast for
several days and the interest created by the phe-
nomenon had almost disappeared in the ordinary
course of human affairs only the astronomers
were aware of the novas progress and they had
no desire to arouse what they considered needless
anxiety in the public mind

  but on march sixteenth a most extraordinary
thing happened a sudden wind had sprung up
early in the morning and as all london was going
to its daily occupations a rift occurred among the
flying cloudbands and there in broad daylight
shining brightly in the northern heavens was nova
cassiopeiae city dwellers do not often waste their
time in contemplation of the heavens and for a few
moments the sight was unnoticed but a laborer
who was obliged to lift his gaze in order to view
some work being carried on in a building over-
head was the first to see it for a moment he did
not move staring blankly slowly without uttering
a sound he pointed toward the north his com-
panions attracted by his strange attitude gathered
around him and looked in the direction he was
pointing many who doubted the testimony of their
own senses rubbed their eyes and looked again
the star was still there its radiance causing it to
appear a veritable miniature sun

  the news spread quickly as if carried by a hid-
den electric current entire streets were block-
aded in many sections of the city all traffic had
suddenly come to a stop the cries of excited and
hysterical women mingled with the clanging of
tram-cars and the roar of motors the windows of
the great buildings were filled with thousands of
heads on the morning of the sixteenth business
was paralyzed and it was not until well into the
afternoon that order was restored and men could
continue their work and even then things were
far from being normal a strange feeling of un-
easiness was in the air and among the authorities
some concern was felt lest the mornings excite-
ment might result in a panic during the night

  in order to allay the nervousness of the public
as much as possible a statement was drawn up
and signed by the astronomer royal of england
this proclamation of which several thousand copies
were immediately posted in conspicuous places in-
formed the people that although the size and bril-
liance of the new star were certainly unusual many
novae had been known to act strangely in the past
and there was no cause whatever for alarm it also
announced that the object must be at least two or
three hundred light years distant so that the light
they saw probably left its starting point during the
days of queen elizabeth in short everything was
explainable upon purely natural grounds and there
was therefore no possible danger to fear

  with the exception of a few sensational sheets
this notice was printed by the evening papers to-
gether with other remarks of the same nature
thus reassured and the clouds having reappeared

people went home to their dinners feeling rather
sheepish over their previous anxiety

  but another surprise was in store for them for
that evening the sky completely cleared and be-
hold  the novas light exceeded even that of the
moon the city was illuminated almost as brightly
as during the murky london day despite the as-
surances of the astronomers the effect was ghastly
that night millions of the citys inhabitants stood
gazing at the strange phenomenon and speaking to
one another in subdued and frightened tones the
effect of the proclamation had worn off the people
were not so certain of the astronomers infallibility

  what had occurred in london had happened in
nearly every other city in the world paris vienna
berlin leningrad rome and new york had all
been shaken by the sight of the new star observ-
atories colleges and weather stations had been
flooded with inquiries each day the press con-
tained some new note of reassurance from the au-
thorities

  the authorities however were longer very
sure of themselves in all of this time no one had
thought of bielas comet or professor montes-
quieuxs prediction but now that the date of the
vernal equinox was almost at hand an astronomer
of the french academy who had heard the profes-
sors warning voiced the opinion that the nova
might be the predicted comet this suggestion
which was at first ridiculed gradually gained
ground and by the nineteenth of march two days
before the vernal equinox the scientific world
knew with certainty that the visitor was actually a
comet approaching perihelion at a rapidly increas-
ing speed

  it was at first intended that the news should be
confined to scientific circles and not be made pub-
lic but as such news usually does it soon leaked
out and was made known to an already badly
frightened world business was suspended the
evening of the nineteenth and the morning of the
twentieth saw the most startling scenes ever wit-
nessed among civilized people sleep was un-
thought of even the necessity of eating and
drinking was forgotten churches newspaper of-
fices and centers of learning were filled and sur-
rounded by fear-stricken mobs eagerly snatching
at the most wild and impossible rumors

  early on the morning of the twentieth the
french academy had hurriedly assembled at a
notice from its president as the scientists took
their seats their faces appeared drawn and hag-
gard yet there was no sign of fear these men
who realized more fully than the crowd outside the
real nature of the peril were nevertheless calm and
attentive dr beauvais slowly rose to address the
assembly his face was pale and deep circles were
around his eyes but his calm and self-assurance
were perfect never had he appeared more worthy
of the high position which he held

  gentlemen he began at this which is per-
haps our last meeting i have only one sentiment to
express-regret i have failed in my duty and the
fault is solely my own the only man capable of
predicting the impending catastrophe was too great
a genius for us to understand only one thing re-
mains for me to do-to make what restitution i
can to the man i have so greatly injured i go

gentlemen to the side of alphonse montesquieux
the worlds greatest mathematical genius and the
glory of the french race those who wish may fol-
low

iv

t rofessor montesquieux had taken his con-
i-finement quite philosophically for he was
j given complete freedom in the establishment
and he was certain that in a few months his pre-
diction would be fully vindicated jean bourget
had been the professors constant companion dur-
ing the latters retirement and the two had spent
many pleasant hours in perfecting the new mathe-
matics and watching the approach of nova cassi-
opeiae after it had become visible the professor
had moreover followed the trend of events through
the columns of the daily press and while he was
naturally moved to compassion at the panic caused
by the approaching collision he was nevertheless in-
tensely interested in the results which this collision
would produce this sense of agreeable expectation
at the approach of an impending catastrophe is pe-
culiar only to the genuine man of science and
would be wholly unintelligible to the man of the
world the professor would have gladly given his
life or done anything else in his power to avert the
collision and save humanity but as he could do
nothing further and as the catastrophe was no
fault of his own he felt a lively professional curi-
osity in the coming event

  professor montesquieux had expected a last mo-
ment visit from his scientific colleagues of the
academy and in consequence he was not surprised
when he saw several motor cars draw up in the
driveway outside and his old enemy dr beauvais
step out of the foremost machine in view of his
victory and the approaching destruction of them
all the professor had lost all feeling of rancor to-
ward his old enemies indeed he experienced a sort
of professional pity for their ignorance it was
therefore with a smile of welcome that he met dr
beauvais at the door of the apartment

  alphonse montesquieuxsaid the president
simply can you forgive me

  yes replied the professor with some emotion
i do forgive you most freely the fault was mine
as much as yours for had i been less stubborn and
put my calculations in more understandable form
the present situation might never have occurred
however it is now too late for regrets let us lose
no part of the mighty spectacle about to be pre-
sented to our eyes i have a small telescope in-
stalled here which will serve for any observations
we may care to make paris i understand is panic-
stricken undisturbed observation would there be
an impossibility let us remain here undisturbed
where science may observe if the disaster is not
complete our observations may be of great value to
the future

  the setting sun was just disappearing over the
western horizon its golden rays showering the
earth for perhaps the last time in its history but
with the disappearance of the sun twilight did not
ensue instead a weird phosphorescent brilliance
took its place the awful proximity of the come-
tary mass was now fully apparent it occupied over

a quarter of the entire sky in the center the disk
of the nucleus could be clearly discerned while the
glowing coma shot out by the expulsion of light
seemed nothing less than the fiery breath of some
dragon of antiquity

  the professor had calculated the comets speed
when near perihelion at not less than  miles per
second his observations showed that the nucleus
was now approximately  miles distant from
the ecliptic its course being in a direct line with
the earths position at the vernal equinox as the
comet was traveling at the speed of  miles per
minute or  miles per hour it would strike
the earths orbit in about seven hours the earth
moving at the rate of  miles per hour would
traverse the remaining  miles separating it
from the equinox in exactly the same time the
collision therefore would be due at one oclock in
the morning when the vernal equinox would have
been reached

  the scientists watched through the long hours in
almost unbroken silence awe and interest were
mingled upon their faces yet even now there was
little fear trained in the observation of nature
for years they were not to be terrified by her man-
ifestations

  by midnight the whole northern sky seemed to
be on fire the few first magnitude stars which had
been visible in the early evening had long since
faded from sight and the earth was now illumin-
ated by a ghastly radiance apparently exceeding
even that of sunlight the atmosphere had at first
felt sultry and this had given place to steadily in-
creasing heat

  in a small church located a short distance away
the bells were tolling inside devout peasants were
lying paralyzed with fear heroic priests upheld
by their faith were administering the last sacra-
ments but there was little response as usually
happens in cases of extreme fright panic had been
succeeded by temporary paralysis of the nervoius
system

  at five minutes to one professor montesquieux
and his companions witnessed the most striking
spectacle ever recorded in the history of the world
the sky was now one complete ball of flame due
to the intense heat and noxious cometary gases the
air was suffocating swarms of red and yellow
meteors were everywhere striking the earth two
minutes later the professor was blinded by a thou-
sand brilliant streaks of light and the heavy build-
ing reverberated as if it were undergoing a severe
bombardment suddenly a terrific concussion was
felt the scientists were thrown violently to the
floor in the mind of professor montesquieux
everything turned red and then changed to black-
ness he lost consciousness

ixhen he awoke the first object of which he
  was aware was the bandaged head of dr
beauvais who was leaning over him in eager solici-
tude the room was illuminated by the feeble rays
of a flickering wax candle the majority of the
men were still reclining where they had been thrown
by the shock

  and the comet inquired the professor as soon
as he was able to speak

  the earth replied dr beauvais solemnly is
the lost comet



saved by an act of providence the central nucleus
of the comet missed the terrestrial surface by a dis-
tance which could not have exceeded  miles
the concussion we felt a few moments ago was due
to debris emitted by the coma the danger is now
past much damage has undoubtedly been done but
nothing has occurred that cannot be repaired with-
in a few months time and there my friend he
continued suddenly pointing to a broken window
is the last i hope we shall ever see of this mad
comet and high in the southern heavens its tail
now clearly visible was bielas fast retreating
comet plunging headlong into space

  for a few moments the professor was lost in med-
itation finally he spoke gentlemen he said
quietly i have made a serious and unforgivable
mistake this deviation in the comets path is
wholly accounted for by the perturbation caused in
passing the jovian orbit how this could have been
overlooked in my calculations i cannot conceive-
but i offer both you and the world my most humble
apology and to think of the untold suffering and

panic i might have prevented had i but foreseen
this but let the blame and the humiliation both
be mine

 but my dear montesquieux interrupted the
president impatiently what madness is this do
you not realize that your prediction has justly en-
titled you to be considered the foremost mathema-
tician of the world  think of the glory this will re-
flect upon france alphonse montesquieux the
french newton the new mathematics will revolu-
tionize the world

  no replied the professor gravely i have
failed although i rejoice in the escape of human-
ity i cannot return to the world the world soon
forgets and in reaction from its panic it will claim
revenge i should soon be ridiculed and perhaps
even be accused of having caused the panic by my
false predictions no my friends i cannot return
i intend to stay where i am you were right in
placing me here and i shall remain

  and the professor kept his word

   the end

the fate of the poseidonia

  by clare winger harris
  concluded

superb figure stood and gazed into the deep velvety
blue of the sky the others following the direction
of their leaders gaze

  involuntarily i too watched the welkin where now
not even a moon was visible then within the range
of my vision there moved a great object-the huge
aerial gyroscope-and beneath it dwarfed by its
far greater bulk hung a modern ocean-liner like a
jewel from the neck of some gigantic ogre

  great god-it was the poseidonia i knew now
in spite of the earthly appearance of the great ship
that it was no terrestrial scene upon which i gazed
i was beholding the victory of martell the martian
who had filled his worlds canals with water of
earth and even borne away trophies of our civiliza-
tion to exhibit to his fellow-beings

  i closed my eyes to shut out the awful scene and
thought of margaret dead and yet aboard the liner
frozen in the absolute cold of outer space

  how long i sat stunned and horrified i do not
know but when i looked back for another last
glimpse of the martian landscape i uttered a gasp
of incredulity a face filled the entire vaporous
screen the beloved features of margaret landon
she was speaking and her voice came over the dis-
tance like the memory of a sound that is not quite
audible and yet very real to the person in whose
mind it exists it was more as if time divided us
instead of space yet i knew it was the latter for
while a few minutes of time came between us mil-
lions of miles of space intervened

  george came the sweet far-away voice i
loved you but you were so suspicious and jealous
that i accepted the companionship of martell hoping

to bring you to your senses i did not know what an
agency for evil he had established upon the earth
forgive me dear

  she smiled wistfully my parents perished with
hundreds of others in the transportation of the
poseidonia but martell took me from the ship to
the ether-craft for the journey so that i alone was
saved

  her eyes filled with tears do not mourn for me
george for i shall take up the thread of life anew
among these strange but beautiful surroundings
mars is indeed lovely but i will tell you of it later
for i cannot talk long now

  i only want to say she added hastily that
terra need fear mars no more there is a suffi-
ciency of water now-and i will prevent any-
she was gone and in her stead was the leering
malevolent face of martell he was minus his skull-
cap and his clipped feathers stood up like the ruff
of an angry turkey-gobbler

  i reached instinctively for the dial but before my
hand touched it there came a sound not unlike that
of escaping steam and instantaneously the picture
vanished i did not object to the disappearance of
the martian but another fact did cause me regret
from that moment i was never able to view the
ruddy planet through the agency of the little ma-
chine all communication had been forever shut
off by martell

  although many doubt the truth of my solution to
the mystery of the disappearance of the pegasus
and of the poseidonia and are still searching be-
neath the ocean waves i know that never will either
of them be seen again on earth

solanders radio tomb



first met mr remington solander
shortly after i installed my first radio
set i was going in to new york on the
 am train and was sitting with
my friend murchison and as a matter
of course we were talking radio i had just told
murchison that he was a lunkheaded noodle and that
for two cents i would poke him in the jaw and that
even a pin-headed idiot ought to know that a tube
set was better than a crystal set to this murchison
had replied that that settled it he said he had
always known i was a moron and now he was sure
of it

  if you had enough brains to fill a hazelnut shell
he said you wouldnt talk that way anybody but
a half-baked lunatic would know that what a man
wants in radio is clear sharp reception and thats
what a crystal gives you youre one of these half-
wits that think theyre classy if they can hear some
two-cent station five hundred miles away utter a few
faint squeaks shut up i dont want to talk to
you i dont want to listen to you go and sit
somewhere else

  of course this was what was to be expected of
murchison and if i did let out a few laps of
anger i feel i was entirely justified radio fans are
always disputing over the relative merits of crystal
and tube sets but i knew i was right i was just
trying to decide whether to choke murchison with
my bare hand and throw his lifeless body out of the
car window or tell him a few things i had been
wanting to say ever since he began knocking my
tube set when this remington solander who was
sitting behind us leaned forward and tapped me on
the shoulder i turned quickly and saw his long
sheeplike face close to mine he was chewing car-
damon seed and breathing the odor into my face

  my friend he said come back and sit with
me i want to ask you a few questions about radio

  well i couldnt resist that could i no radio
fan could i did not care much for tne looks of this
remington solander man but for the last few weeks
my friends had seemed to be steering away from me
when i drew near although i am sure i never said
anything to bore them all i ever talked about was
my radio set and some
new hook-ups i was try-
ing but i had noticed that
men who formerly had
seemed to be fond of my
company now gave
startled looks when i
neared them some even
climbed over the nearest
fence and ran madly
across vacant lots look-
ing over their shoulders
with frightened glances as they ran for a week i
had not been able to get any man of my acquaintance
to listen to one word from me except murchison
and he is an utter idiot as i think i have made clear
so i left murchison and sat with remington
solander

 a radio set proposed for the cemetery

in one way i was proud to be invited to sit with
remington solander because he was far and
away the richest man in our town when he died

his estate proved to amount to three million dollars
i had seen him often and i knew who he was but he
was a stand-offish old fellow and did not mix so i
had never met him he was a tall man and thin
somewhat flabby and he was pale in an unhealthy
sort of way but after all he was a millionaire and
a member of one of the old families of westcote
so i took the seat alongside of him with considerable
satisfaction

  i gather he said as soon as i was seated that
you are interested in radio

  i told him i was

  and im just building a new set using a new
hook-up that i heard of about a week ago i said
i think it is going to be a wonder now here is the

idea instead of using a grid-

  yes yes the old aristocrat said hastily but
never mind that now i know very little of such
things i have an electrician employed by the year
to care for my radio set and i leave all such things
to him you are a lawyer are you not

  i told him i was

  and you are chairman of the trustees of the
westcote cemetery are you not he asked

  i told him i was that also and i may say that
the westcote cemetery association is one of the
rightest and tightest little corporations in existence
it has been in existence since  and has been
exceedingly profitable to those fortunate enough to
hold its stock i inherited the small block i own
from my grandfather recently we trustees had
bought sixty additional acres adjoining the old
cemetery and had added them to it and we were
about ready to put the new lots on the market at
 apiece there promised to be a tremendous
profit in the thing for our cemetery was a fash-
ionable place to be buried in and the demand for
the lots in the new addition promised to be enor-
mous

solanders will and testament

ttou have not known it said remington

  y	solander in- his slow drawl which had the
jl effect of letting his words slide out of his
mouth and drip down his long chin like cold molas-
ses but i have been mak-
ing inquiries about you
and i have been meaning
to speak to you i am
drawing up a new last
will and testament and
i want you to draw up
one of the clauses for
me

  why certainly mr
solander i said with in-
creased pride ill be
glad to be of service to you

  i am choosing you for the work remington
solander said because you know and love radio
as i do and because you are a trustee of the ceme-
tery association are you a religious man

  well i said a little uneasily some some
but not much

  no matter said mr solander placing a hand
on my arm i am i have always been from
my earliest youth my mind has been on serious
things as a matter of fact sir i have compiled a

  pigs is pigs butler quite surpasses himself in this
 story the intricacies of radio are so great and the
 changes occur so quickly that no one can afford to make
 a will wherein a radio provision figures once we thought
 of having a radio loud speaker installed in our coffin to
 keep us company and to make it less lonesome after
 reading this story we quickly changed our mind it is one
 of the funniest most mirth-provoking bits of humor we
 have come across in a long while


amazing stories

manuscript collection of religious quotations
hymns sermons and uplifting thoughts which now
fill fourteen volumes all in my own handwriting
fortunately i inherited money and this collection
is my gift to the world

  and a noble one im sure i said

  most noble said mr solander but sir i
have not confined my activities to the study chair
i have kept my eye on the progress of the world
and it seems to me that radio this new and wonder-
ful invention is the greatest discovery of all ages
and imperishable but sir it is being twisted to
cheap uses jazz cheap songs worldly words
and music that i mean to remedy

  well i said it might be done of course
people like what they like

  some nobler souls like better things said rem-
ington solander solemnly some more worthy men
and women will welcome nobler radio broadcasting
in my will i am putting aside one million dollars
to establish and maintain a broadcasting station
that will broadcast only my fourteen volumes of
hymns aiid uplifting material every day this mat-
ter will go forth-sermons lectures on prohibition
noble thoughts and religious poems

arranging the contract

i assured him that some people might be
glad to get that-that a lot of people might
in fact and that i could write that into his
will without any trouble

  ah said remington solander but that is
already in my will what i want you to write for
my will is another clause i mean to build in your
cemetery a high-class and imperishable granite
tomb for myself i mean to place it on that knoll-
that high knoll-the highest spot in your cemetery
what i want you to write into my will is a clause
providing for the perpetual care and maintenance
of my tomb i want to set aside five hundred thou-
sand dollars for that purpose

  well i said to the sheep-faced millionaire i
can do that too

  yes he agreed and i want to give to my
family and relations the remaining million and a
half dollars provided he said accenting the pro-
vided they carry out faithfully the provisions of
the clause providing for the perpetual care and
maintenance of my tomb if they dont care and
maintain he said giving me a hard look that
million and a half is to go to the home for flea-
bitten dogs

theyll care and maintain all right i laughed
i think so said remington solander gravely
i do think so indeed and now sir we come to
the important part you as i know are a trustee
of the cemetery

  yes i said i am

  for drawing this clause of my will if you can
draw it said remington solander looking me full
in the eye with both his own which were like the
eyes of a salt mackerel i shall pay you fivp thou-
sand dollars

  well i almost gasped it was a big lot of money
for drawing one clause of a will and i began to smell
a rat right there but i may say the proposition
remington solander made to me was one i was able
after quite a little talk with toy fellow trustees of

the cemetery to carry out what remington sol-
ander wanted was to be permitted to put a radio
loud-speaking outfit in his granite tomb-a radio
loud-speaking outfit permanently set at  meters
wave-length which was to be the wave-length of
his endowed broadcasting station i dont know
how remington solander first got this remarkable
idea but about that time an undertaker in new
york had rigged up a hearse with a phonograph so
that the hearse would loud-speak suitable hymns on
the way to the cemetery and that may have sug-
gested the loud-speaking tomb to remington sol-
ander but it is not important where he got the-
idea he had it and he was set on having it car-
ried out

the dissemination of religion from the cemetery

   a ahink he said of the uplifting effect of

   i it on the highest spot in the cemetery
jl will stand my noble tomb loud-speaking in
all directions the solemn and holy words and music
i have collected in my fourteen volumes all who
enter the cemetery will hear all will be ennobled
and uplifted

   that was so too i saw that at once i said so
so remington solander went on to explain that
the income from the five hundred thousand dollars
would be set aside to keep a batteries and b
batteries supplied to keep the outfit in repair and so
on so i tackled the job rather enthusiastically
i dont say that the five thousand dollar fee did
not interest me but i did think remington solander
had a grand idea it would make our cemetery
stand out people would come from everywhere to
see and listen the lots in the new addition would
sell like hot cakes

   but i did have a little trouble with the other
trustees they balked when i explained that rem-
ington solander wanted the sole radio loud-speaking
rights of our cemetery but some one finally sug-
gested that if remington solander put up a new
and artistic iron fence around the whole cemetery
it might be all right they made him submit his
fourteen volumes so they could see what sort of
matter he meant to broadcast from his high-class
station and they agreed it was solemn enough it
was all solemn and sad and gloomy just the stuff
for a cemetery so when remington solander
agreed to build the new iron fence they made a
formal contract with him and i drew up the clause
for the will and he bought six lots on top of the
high knoll and began erecting his marble mauso-
leum

the building of the monument and the death
of the tenant

  or eight months or so remington solander
w was busier than he had ever been in his life
i he superintended the building of the tomb
and he had on hand the job of getting his endowed
radio station going-it was given the letters wzzz
-and hiring artists to sing and play and speechify
his fourteen volumes of gloom and uplift at 
meters and it was too much for the old codger
the very night the test of the wzzz outfit was made
he passed away and was no more on earth

   his funeral was one of the biggest we ever had
in westcote i should judge that five thousand peo-
solanders radio tomb



pie attended his remains to the cemetery for it had
become widely known that the first wzzz program
would be received and loud-spoken from remington
solanders tomb that afternoon the first selection
on the program-his favorite hymn-beginning as
the funeral cortege left the church and the pro-
gram continuing until dark

  ill say it was one of the most affecting occasions
i have ever witnessed as the body was being car-
ried into the tomb the loud speaker gave us a ser-
mon by rev peter l ruggus full of sob stuff and
every one of the five thousand present wept and
when the funeral was really finished over two thous-
and remained to hear the rest of the program which
consisted of hymns missionary reports static and
recitations of religious poems we increased the
price of the lots in the new addition one hundred
dollars per lot immediately and we sold four lots
that afternoon and two the next morning the
big metropolitan newspapers all gave the westcote
cemetery full page illustrated articles the next sun-
day and we received during the next week over
three hundred letters mostly from ministers prais-
ing what we had done

increased sales on lots

but that was not the best of it requests
for lots began to come in by mail not only
people in westcote wrote for prices but
people away over in new jersey and up in west-
chester country and even from as far away as
poughkeepsie and delaware we had twice as
many requests for lots as there were lots to sell
and we decided we would have an auction and let
them go to the highest bidders you see rem-
ington solanders talking tomb was becoming
nationally famous we began to negotiate with
the owners of six farms adjacent to our cemetery we
figured on buying them and making more new addi-
tions to the cemetery and then we found we could
not use three of the farms

  the reason was that the loud speaker in reming-
ton solanders tomb would not carry that far
it was not strong enough so we went to the execu-
tors of his estate and ran up against another snag
-nothing in the radio outfit in the tomb could be
altered in any way whatever that was in the
will the same loud speaker had to be maintained
the same wave-length had to be kept the same makes
of batteries had to be used the same style of tubes
had to be used remington solander had thought
of all that so we decided to let well enough alone
-it was all we could do anyway we bought the
farms that were reached by the loud speaker and

had them surveyed and laid out in lots-and then
the thing happened

the cemtery ruined by jazz

tes sir ill sell my cemetery stock for two

  y	cents on the dollar if anybody will bid that
jl much for it for what do you think happened
along came the government of the united states
regulating this radio thing and assigned new wave-
lengths to all the broadcasting stations it gave
remington solanders endowed broadcasting station
wzzz an -meter wave-length and it gave that
station at dodwood-station pkx-the -meter
wave-length and the next day poor old remington
solanders tomb poured forth yes we aint got
no bananas and the hot dog jazz and if you
dont see mama every night you cant see mama
at all and hink tubbs in his funny stories like
well one day an irishman and a swede were walk-
ing down broadway and they see a flapper coming
towards them and she had on one of them short
skirts they was wearing nee so mike he says gee
be jabbers ole i see a peach so the swede he
says lookin at the silk stockings mebby you ban
see a peach mike but i ban see one mighty nice
pair well the other day i went to see my mother-
in-law-

  you know the sort of program i dont say that
the people who like them are not entitled to them
but i do say they are not the sort of programs to
loud-speak from a tomb in a cemetery i expect old
remington solander turned clear over in his tomb
when those programs began to come through i
know our board of trustees went right up in the air
but there was not a thing we could do about it
the newspapers gave us double pages the next sun-
day-remington solanders jazz tomb and
westcotes two-step cemetery and within a
week the inmates of our cemetery began to move
out friends of people who had been buried over
a hundred years came and moved them to other
cemeteries and took the headstones and monuments
with them and in a month our cemetery looked
like one of those great war battlefields-like a lot
of shell-holes not a man woman or child was left
in the place-except remington solander in his
granite tomb on top of the high knoll what weve
got on our hands is a deserted cemetery

  they all blame me but i cant do anything about
it all i can do is groan-every morning i grab
the paper and look for the pkx program and then
i groan remington solander is the lucky man-
hes dead

swifter than yolara she raised the arm that held the vine-and now i knew this was no inert blossoming thing it was alive
it writhed down her arm and its five rubescent flower heads thrust out toward the priestess vibrating quivering held in leash

only by the light touch of the handmaiden at its very end

                                        
what went before

    hile sitting aboard the southern queen fighting the
sinister spell of papua dr walter t goodwin recognizes in the
tall man coming up the plank one of his oldest friends singu-
larly changed only one month earlier dr david throckmartin had
set forth for nanmatal an extraordinary group of island ruins
along the eastern shore of ponape in the carolines together with his
wife edith dr charles stanton his young associate and thora hal-
verson a swedish woman ediths nurse

  in throekmartins cabin that evening dr goodwin the narrator
of the story learns the reason for the strange change he learns about
another world alien unfamiliar a world of terror whose unknown
joy is its greatest terror-of the dweller who lures his victims in the
path of the moon streams of the fate of edith and stanton and thora
and later as though in answer to an irresistible call throckmartin
disappears out of his cabin into the night

  dr goodwin goes to melbourne in the hopes of getting a rescue
party though he realises that very few indeed would believe his
friends story of the moon path en route for ponape and the nan-
matal on the suwarna they sight the brunhilda on which
they see its captain olaf huldrxcksson lashed to the wheel in a piti-
able state they learn that he had tied himself to the wheel in order
to escape the will of the dweller they learn when olaf becomes suffi-
ciently calm and trustful that the dweller had claimed his wife and
child when the moon was high and that now he is in search of the
sparkling devil goodwin tells him he also has the same purpose
in mind for he wants to find his friends

  larry okeefe american and irish  has implicit faith in the
banshee an irish legendary woman spirit warning of approaching
death by her cries but is curiously free from most other supersti-
tions although he wonders at the seeming gullibility of dr goodwin
he decides to pool his lot with that of goodwin and olaf and joins
in the search

  after many adventures they reach ponape where with the aid of
the maps which throckmartin had left them they find the nan-
matal and the entrance to the moon pool in the full moon they

wait with automatics ready for the rock to open and the dweller to
come forth the miraculous happens-the rock opens then a shot
is heard and they discover a german scientist von hetzdorp who is
there to find the secret of life for germany he realizes that they
all could do more than he alone so he tells them what he has learned
of the place and they tell what they know of it

  von hetzdorp tells them that the rock remains open for at least
three hours and they go within to investigate thev see huldricksson
partly submerged in the moon pool wherein his child had just drop-
ped from his hands they pull him out and the german treats him
with some specially prepared liquid which neutralizes the bums of
radium and x-rays given by the radioactive liquid in the moon pool

  they explore along the terrace and come to another wall on which is
a vine with five flowers more heavily designed than the others as
they look on they notice a great oval begin to glow wax almost to a
flame and shine out as though a light were streaming through the stone
itself gradually the shadows thicken and suddenly two figures stand
before them-one a golden-eyed girl and the other a grotesque frog
woman thus came lakla handmaiden of the silent one to show
them the way to the interior

  as she directed larry presses his fingers on the circles on the wall
and suddenly the wind seems to roar above them the rosy wall disap-
pears and they drop in a car at a tremendous speed to earth-heart
when they get off the car they see a sparkling nebulosity rising into
infinite distances miles away gigantic luminous cliffs spring sheer
from the limits of a lake whose waters are of milky opalescence
with larry in the lead they march further toward another entrance
soon they are met by a group of powerful green dwarfs after some
conversation radorf the leader of the dwarfs brings them to the
princess yolara priestess of the shining one and lugur its voice
when yolara and lugur learn that it was the vine and flowers
design that enabled these people of the outer world to enter their
previous hostility is no longer obviousthough they still feel resent-
ment the searchers learn that the vine with five flowers is the sign
of the silent one

the justice of lora

ksebinnd again the globe ran swiftly with its
film of colors darkened and shone rosy
once more from without there came
the rustle of many feet upon the rugs
bbsfibbil yolara pressed a slender hand upon the
base of the pedestal of the globe beside her abrupt-
ly the light faded from all and on the same instant
the four walls of black-
ness vanished revealing
on two sides the lovely un-
familiar garden through
the guarding rows of pil-
lars at our backs soft
draperies hid what lay be-
yond before us flanked
by flowered screens was
the corridor through
which we had entered
crowded now by the green
dwarfs of the great hall

the dwarfs advanced

each i now noted had
the same clustering black
hair of rador they sep-
arated and from them stepped three figures -
a youth of not more than twenty short but with
the great shoulders of all the males we had seen of
this race a girl of seventeen i judged white-faced
a head taller than the boy her long black hair
dishevelled and behind these two a stunted
gnarled shape whose head was sunk deep between
the enormous shoulders whose white beard fell like
that of some ancient gnome down to his waist and
whose eyes were a white flame of hate the girl
cast herself weeping at the feet of the priestess

the youth stood there and regarded her curiously

  you are songar of the lower waters mur-
mured yolara almost caressingly and this is
your daughter and her lover

  the gnome nodded the flame in his eyes leaping
higher

  it has come to me that you three have dared
blaspheme the shining one its priestess and its
voice went on yolara smoothly also that you
have called out to the three silent ones is it

true

your spies have spoken
-and have you not al-
ready judged us the
voice of the old dwarf was
bitter

  a flicker shot through
the eyes of yolara again
cold grey the girl reached
a trembling hand out to
the hem of the priestess
veils

  tell us why you did
these things songar
she said why you did
them knowing full well
what your - reward -
would be

  the dwarf stiffened he raised his withered arms
and his eyes blazed

  because evil are your thoughts and evil are
your deeds he cried yours and your lovers
there- he levelled a finger at lugur because of
the shining one you have made evil too and the
greater wickedness you contemplate-you and he
with the shining one but i tell you that your
measure of iniquity is full the tale of your sin
near ended yea-the silent ones have been pa-

y

 ty this time after you have read the first installment
 of the moon pool you must have become con-
 vinced that here is the scientifiction story in this the
 second installment the shining one is much in evidence
 and if anything the mystery begins to deepen as with
 bated breath you read on of the astounding exploits of
 the adventurers but there is no use pointing out any
 one part of the story because there is hardly a para-
 graph that does not command your full and undivided
 interest and still the mystery grows and still the
 astounding things which are holding your attention keep
 on coming fast and thick and you begin to wonder at
 the well-nigh inexhaustible fund of imagination which
 our author possesses




amazing stories

tient but soon they will speak he pointed at us
a sign are they-a warning-harlot he spat
the word

  in yolaras eyes grown black the devils leaped
unrestrained

  is it even so songar her voice caressed
now ask the silent ones to help you they sit
afar-but surely they will hear you the sweet
voice was mocking as for these two they shall
pray to the shining one for forgiveness-and
surely the shining one will take them to its bosom
as for you-you have lived long enough songar
pray to the silent ones songar and pass out into
the nothingness-you

  she dipped down into her bosom and drew forth
something that resembled a small cone of tarnished
silver she levelled it a covering clicked from its
base and out of it darted a slender ray of intense
green light

  it struck the old dwarf squarely over the heart
and spread swift as light itself covering him with
a gleaming pale film she clenched her hand upon
the cone and the ray disappeared she thrust the
cone back into her breast and leaned forward ex-
pectantly so lugur and so the other dwarfs
from the girl came a low wail of anguish the boy
dropped upon his knees covering his face

  for the moment the white beard stood rigid
then the robe that had covered him seemed to melt
away revealing all the knotted monstrous body
and ip that body a vibration began increasing to
incredible rapidity it wavered before us like a
reflection in a still pond stirred by a sudden wind
it grew and grew-to a rhythm whose rapidity was
intolerable to watch and that still chained the eyes

  the figure grew indistinct misty tiny sparks
in infinite numbers leaped from it-like i thought
the radiant shower of particles hurled out by ra-
dium when seen in the spinthariscope mistier still
it grew-there trembled before us for a moment
a faintly luminous shadow which held here and
there tiny sparkling atoms like those that pulsed
in the light about us the glowing shadow van-
ished the sparkling atoms wfere still for a moment
-and shot awaiy joining those dancing others

  where the gnomelike form had been but a few
seconds before-there was nothing

  okeefe drew a long breath and i was sensible
of a prickling along my scalp

  yolara leaned toward us

  you have seen she said her eyes lingered
tigerishly upon olafs pallid face heed she
whispered she turned to the men in green who
were laughing softly among themselves

  take these two and go she commanded

  the justice of lora said the red dwarf the
justice of lora and the shining one under than-
aroa

  upon the utterance of the last word i saw von
hetzdorp start violently the hand at his side
made a swift surreptitious gesture so fleeting that
i hardly caught it the red dwarf stared at the
german and there was amazement upon his face

  swiftly as von hetzdorp he returned it

  yolara the red dwarf spoke it would please
me to take this man of wisdom to my own place

for a time i would have the giant come too

the woman awoke from her brooding nodded

  as you will lugur she said

  and as shaken to the core we passed out into
the garden into the full throbbing of the light i
wondered if all the tiny sparkling diamond points
that shook about us had once been men like songar
of the lower waters-and felt my very soul grow
sick

chapter xv

the angry whispering globe

our way led along a winding path between
banked massesof softly radiant blooms
groups of feathery ferns whose plumes
were starred with fragrant white and blue flower-
ets slender creepers swinging from the branches
of the strangely trunked trees bearing along their
threads orchid-like blossoms both delicately frail
and gorgeously flamboyant

  the path we trod was an exquisite mosaic-
pastel greens and pinks upon a soft grey base
garlands of nimbused forms like the flaming rose
of the rosicrucians held in the mouths of the fly-
ing serpents a smaller pavilion arose before us
single-storied front wide open

  upon its threshold rador paused bowed deeply
and motioned us within the chamber we entered
was large closed on two sides by screens of grey
at the back gay concealing curtains the low table
of blue stone dressed with fine white cloths
stretched at one side flanked by the cushioned
divans

  at the left was a high tripod bearing one of the
rosy globes we had seen in the house of yolara
at the head of the table a smaller globe similar to
the whispering one rador pressed upon its base
and two other screens slid into place across the
entrance shutting in the room

  he clapped his hands the curtains parted and
two girls came through them tall and willow lithe
their bluish-black hair falling in ringlets just be-
low their white shoulders their clear eyes of for-
get-me-not blue and skins of extraordinary fineness
and purity-they were singularly attractive each
was clad in an extremely scanty bodice of silken
blue girdled above a kirtle that came barely to
their very pretty knees

  food and drink ordered rador

  they dropped back through the curtains

  do you like them he asked us

  some chickens said larry they delight the
heart he translated for rador

the green dwarfs next remark made me gasp

  they are yours he said

  before i could question him further upon this
extraordinary statement the pair reentered bear-
ing a great platter on which were small loaves
strange fruits and three immense flagons of rock
crystal-two filled with a slightly sparkling yellow
liquid and the third with a purplish drink i be-
came acutely sensible that it had been hours since
i had either eaten or drunk the yellow flagons
were set before larry and me the purple at
radors hand
the moon pool



  the girls at his signal again withdrew i raised
my glass to my lips and took a deep draft the
taste was unfamiliar but delightful

  almost at once my fatigue disappeared i real-
ized a clarity of mind an interesting exhilaration
and sense of irresponsibility of freedom from care
that were oddly enjoyable larry became imme-
diately his old gay self

  the green dwarf regarded us whimsically sip-
ping from his great flagon of rock crystal

  much do i desire to know of that world you
came from he said at last-through the rocks
he added slyly

  and much do we desire to know of this world of
yours  rador i answered

  should i ask him of the dweller seek from him
a clue to throckmartin again clearly as a
spoken command came the warning to forbear to
wait and once more i obeyed

  let us learn then from each other the dwarf
was laughing and first-are all above like you-
drawn out-he made an expressive gesture-and
are there many of you

  there are- i hesitated and at last spoke the
polynesian that means tens upon tens multiplied in-
definitely-there are as many as the drops of
water in the lake we saw from the ledge where you
found us i continued many as the leaves on the
trees without and they are all like us-vary-
ingly

  he considered skeptically i could see my re-
mark upon our numbers

  in muria he said at last the men are like me
or like lugur our women are as you see them-
like yolara or those two who served you he hesi-
tated and there is a third but only one

  larry leaned forward eagerly

  brown-haired with glints of ruddy bronze
golden-eyed and lovely as a dream with long slen-
der beautiful hands he cried

  where saw you her interrupted the dwarf
starting to his feet

  saw her larry recovered himself nay
rador perhaps i only dreamed that there was such
a woman

  see to it then that you tell not your dream to
yolara said the dwarf grimly for her i meant
and her you have pictured is lakla the hand-
maiden to the silent ones and neither yolara nor
lugur nay nor the shining one love her over-
much stranger

  does she dwell here larrys face was alight

  the dwarf hesitated glanced about him anx-
iously

  nay he answered ask me no more of her
he was silent for a space and what do you who
are as leaves or drops of water do in that world
of yours he said plainly bent on turning the
subject

  keep off the golden-eyed girl larry i inter-
jected wait till we find out why shes tabu

  love and battle strive and accomplish and die
or fail and die answered larry-to rador-giv-
ing me aquick nod of acquiescence to my warning
in english

  in that at least your world and mine differ
little said the dwarf

  how great is this world of yours rador i
spoke

  he considered me gravely

t tow great indeed i do not know he said

  lj frankly at last the land where we dwell
with the shining one stretches along the white
waters for- he used a phrase of which i could
make nothing beyond this city of the shining
one and on the hither shores of the white waters
dwell the mayia ladala-the common ones he
took a deep draft from his flagon there are
first the fair-haired ones the children of the an-
cient rulers he continued there are second
we the soldiers and last the mayia ladala who dig
and till and weave and toil and give our rulers and
us their daughters and dance with the shining
one he added

  who rules i asked

  the fair-haired under the council of nine who
are under yolara the priestess and lugur the
voice he answered who are in turn beneath the
shining one there was a ring of bitter satire
in the last

  and those three who were judged-this from
larry

  they were of the mayia ladala he replied
like those two i gave you but they grow rest-
less they do not like to dance with the shining
one-the blasphemers he raised his voice in a
sudden great shout of mocking laughter

  in his words i caught a fleeting picture of the
race-an ancient luxurious close-bred oligarchy
clustered about some mysterious deity a soldier
class that supported them and underneath all the
toiling oppressed hordes

  and is that all asked larry

  no he answered there is the sea of crim-
son where-

  without warning the globe beside us sent out a
vicious note rador turned toward it his face pal-
ing its surface crawled with whisperings-angry
peremptory

  i hear he croaked gripping the table i
obey

  he turned to us a face devoid for once of its
malice

  ask me no more questions strangers he said
and now if you are done i will show you where
you may sleep and bathe

  he arose abruptly we followed him through
the hangings passed through a corridor and into
another smaller chamber roofless the sides walled
with screens of dark grey two cushioned couches
were there and a curtained door leading into an
open outer enclosure in which a fountain played
within a wide pool

  your bath said rador he dropped the cur-
tain and came back into the room he touched
a carved flower at one side there was a tiny sigh-
ing from overhead and instantly across the top
spread a veil of blackness impenetrable to light
but certainly not to air for through it pulsed little
breaths of the garden fragrances the room filled


amazing stories

with a cool twilight refreshing sleep-inducing
the green dwarf pointed to the couches

  sleep he said sleep and fear nothing my
men are on guard outside he came closer to us
the old mocking gaiety sparkling in his eyes

 but i spoke too quickly he whispered
whether it is because the afyo maie fears their
tongues-or- he laughed at larry the maids
are not yours still laughing he vanished through
the curtains of the room of the fountain before i
could ask him the meaning of his curious gift its
withdrawal and his most enigmatic closing re-
marks

  back in the great old days of ireland thus
larry breaking into my thoughts raptly the
brogue thick there was cairill mac cairill-
cairill swiftspear an cairill wronged keevan
of emhain abhlach of the blood of angus of the
great people when he was sleeping in the likeness of
a pale reed then keevan put this penance on
cairill-that for a year cairill should wear his body
in emhain abhlach which is the land of faery and
for that year keevan should wear the body of cai-
rill and it was done

  in that year cairill met emar of the birds that
are one white one red and one black-and they
loved and from that love sprang ailill their son
and when ailill was born he took a reed flute and
first he played slumber on cairill and then he
played old age so that cairill grew white and with-
ered then ailill played again and cairill became a
shadow-then a shadow of a shadow-then a
breath and the breath went out upon the wind
he shivered like the old gnome he whispered
that they called songar of the lower waters

  he shook his head as though he cast a dream
from him then all alert-

 but that was in ireland ages agone and
theres nothing like that here doc he laughed
it doesnt scare me one little bit old boy the
pretty devil ladys got the wrong slant when
youve had a pal standing beside you one moment
-full f life and joy and power and potentialities
telling what hes going to do to make the world
hum vhen he gets through killing germans just
running over with zip and pep of life doc-and
the next instant right in the middle of a laugh-
a piece of enemy shell takes off half his head and
with it joy and power and all the rest of it-his
face twitched-well old man in the face of that
mystery a disappearing act such as the devil lady
treated us to doesnt make much of a dent not
on me but by the brogans of brian boru-if we
could have had some of that stuff to turn on the
kaiser-oh boy

he was silent evidently contemplating the idea
with vast pleasure and as for me at that
moment my last doubt of larry okeefe vanished
i saw that he did believe really believed in his
banshees his leprechauns and all the old dreams
of the gael-but only within the limits of ireland

  in one drawer of his mind was packed all his
superstition his mysticism and what of weakness
it might carry but face him with any peril or
problem and the drawer closed instantaneously

leaving a mind that was utterly fearless incredu-
lous and ingenious swept clean of all cobwebs by
as fine a skeptic broom as ever brushed a brain

  some stuff deepest admiration was in hia
voice if wed only had it when the war was on
-imagine half a dozen of us scooting over the
enemy batteries and the jerries underneath all at
once beginning to shake themselves to pieces
wow his tone was rapturous

  its easy enough to explain larry i said
the effect that is-for what the green ray is
made of i dont know of course but what it does
clearly is stimulate atomic vibration to such a pitch
that the cohesion between the particles of matter
is broken and the body flies to bits-just as a fly-
wheel does when its speed gets so great that the
particles of which it is made cant hold together

  shake themselves to pieces is right then he
exclaimed

  absolutely right i nodded everything in
nature vibrates and all matter-whether man or
beast or stone or metal or vegetable-is made up
of vibrating molecules which are made up of vi-
brating atoms which are made up of truly infinitely
small particles of electricity-protons and elec-
trons and these the base of all matter are themselves
perhaps only a vibration of the mysterious ether

  if a magnifying glass of sufficient size and
strength could be placed over us we could see our-
selves as sieves-our space lattice as it is called
and all that is necessary to break down the lattice
to shake us into nothingness is some agent that
will set our atoms vibrating at such a rate that at
last they escape the unseen cords and fly off

  the green ray of yolara is such an agent it
set up in the dwarf that incredibly rapid rhythm
that you saw and-shook him not to atoms-but
to electrons

  they had a gun on the west front-a seventy-
five said okeefe that broke the eardrums of
everybody who fired it no matter what protection
was used it looked like all the other seventy-
fives-but there was something about its sound that
did it they had to recast it

  its practically the same thing i replied by
some freak its vibratory qualities had that effect
the deep whittle of the murdered lusitania would
for instance make the singer building shake to its
foundations while the olympic did not affect the
singer at all but made the woolworth shiver all
through in each case they stimulated the atomic
vibration of the particular building-

  i paused aware all at once of an intense drowsi-
ness okeefe yawning reached down to unfasten
his puttees

  lord im sleepy he exclaimed cant under-
stand it-what you say-most-interesting-
lord he yawned again straightened what
made reddy take such a shine to the von he
asked

  thanaroa i answered fighting to keep my eyes
open

  what

  when lugur spoke that name i saw von hetz-
dorp signal him thanaroa is i suspect the orig-
inal form of the name of tangaroa the greatest
the moon pool



god of the polynesians theres a secret cult to
him in the islands von hetzdorp may belong to
it-he knows it anyway lugttr recognized the sig-
nal and despite his surprise answered it

  the von gave him the high sign eh mused
larry how could they both know it

  the cult is a very ancient one undoubtedly
it had its origin in the dim beginnings before these
people migrated here i replied its a link-
one-of the few links between up there and the

lost past-

  trouble then mumbled larry hell brew-
ing i smell it- say doc is this sleepiness nat-
ural wonder where my-gas mask-is- he
added half incoherently

  but i myself was struggling desperately against
the drugged slumber pressing down upon me

  lakla i heard okeefe murmur lakla of
the golden eyes-no eilidh-the fair he made
an immense effort half raised himself grinned
faintly

 thought this was paradise when i first saw it
doc he sighed but i know now if it is no-
mans land was the greatest place on earth for a
honeymoon they-theyve got us doc- he
sank back good luck old boy wherever youre
going his hand waved feebly glad-knew-

you hope-see-you-gain-

  his voice trailed into silence fighting fight-
ing with every fibre of brain and nerve against the
sleep i felt myself being steadily overcome yet
before oblivion rushed down upon me i seemed to
see upon the grey-screened wall nearest the irish-
man an oval of rosy light begin to glow watched
as my falling lids inexorably fell a flame-tipped
shadow waver on it thicken condense-and there
looking down upon larry her eyes great golden
stars in which intensest curiosity and shy tender-
ness struggled sweet mouth half smiling was the
girl of the moon pools chamber the girl whom
the green dwarf had named-lakla the vision
larry had invoked before that sleep which i could

no longer deny had claimed him-

  closer she came-closer-the eyes were over us
  then oblivion indeed

chapter xvi
yolara of muria vs the okeefe

i awakened with all the familiar homely
sensation of a shade having been pulled up in
a darkened room i thrilled with a wonderful
sense of deep rest and restored resiliency the
ebon shadow had vanished from above and down
into the room was pouring the silvery light from
the fountain pool came a mighty splashing and
shouts of laughter i jumped and drew the cur-
tain okeefe and rador were swimming a wild
race the dwarf like an otter outdistancing and
playing around the irishman at will

  had that overpowering sleep-and now i confess
that my struggle against it had been largely in-
spired by fear that it was the abnormal slumber
which throckmartin had described as having her-
alded the approach of the dweller before it had
carried away thora and stanton-had that sleep

been after all nothing but natural reaction of tired
nerves and brains

  and that last vision of the golden-eyed girl
bending over larry had that also been a delu-
sion of an overstressed mind well it might have
been i could not tell at any rate i decided i
would speak about it to okeefe once we were alone
again-and then giving myself up to the urge of
buoyant well-being i shouted like a boy stripped
and joined the two in the pool the water was
warm and i felt the unwonted tingling of life in
every vein increase something from it seemed to
pulse through the skin carrying a clean vigorous
vitality that toned every fibre tiring at last we
swam to the edge and drew ourselves out the
green dwarf quickly clothed himself and larry
rather carefully donned his uniform

  the afyo made has summoned us doc he
said were to-well-i suppose youd call it
breakfast with her after that rador tells me
were to have a session with the council of nine
i suppose yolara is as curious as any lady of-the
upper world as you might put it-and just nat-
urally cant wait he added

  he gave himself a last shake patted the auto-
matic hidden under his left arm whistled cheer-
fully

  after you my dear alphonse he said to rador
with a low bow the dwarf laughed bent in an
absurd imitation of larrys mocking courtesy and
started ahead of us to the house of the priestess
when he had gone a little way on the orchid-walled
path i whispered to okeefe

  larry when you were falling off to sleep-did
you think you saw anything

  see anything he grinned doc sleep hit me
like a bombshell i thought they were pulling the
gas on us i-i had some intention of bidding you
tender farewells he continued half sheepishly
i think i did start em didnt i

  i nodded

  but wait a minute- he hesitated i had a
queer sort of dream-

  what was it i asked eagerly

  well he answered slowly i suppose it was
because id been thinking of-golden eyes any-
way i thought she came through the wall and
leaned over me-yes and put one of those long
white hands of hers on my head-i couldnt raise
my lids-but in some queer way i could see her
then it got real dreamish why do you ask

  rador turned back toward us

  later i answered not now when were
alone

  but through me went a little glow of reassur-
ance whatever the maze through which we were
moving whatever of menacing evil lurking there-
the golden girl was clearly watching over us
watching with whatever unknown powers she could
muster

  we passed the pillared entrance went through
a long bowered corridor and stopped before a door
that seemed to be sliced from a monolith of pale
jade-high narrow set in a wall of opal

  rador stamped twice and the same supernally
sweet silver bell tones of-yesterday i must call it


amazing stories

although in that place of eternal day the term is
meaningless-bade us enter the door slipped
aside the chamber was small the opal walls
screening it on three sides the black opacity cover-
ing it the fourth side opening out into a delicious
little walled garden-a mass of the fragrant lu-
minous blooms and delicately colored fruit facing
it was a small table of reddish wood and from the
omnipresent cushions heaped around it arose to
greet us-yolara

  larry drew in his breath with an involuntary
gasp of admiration and bowed low my own ad-
miration was as frank-and the priestess was well
pleased with our homage

she was swathed in the filmy translucent webs
now of palest blue the corn-silk hair was
caught within a wide-meshed golden net in which
sparkled tiny brilliants like blended sapphires and
diamonds her own azure eyes sparkled as brightly
as they and i noted again in their clear depths
the half-eager approval as they rested upon
okeefes lithe well-knit figure and his keen clean-
cut face the high-arched slender feet rested upon
soft sandals whose gauzy withes laced the exqui-
sitely formed leg to just below the dimpled knee

  some giddy wonder exclaimed larry looking
at me and placing a hand over his heart put
her on a new york roof and shed empty broadway
take the cue from me doc

  he turned to yolara whose face was somewhat
puzzled

  i said  lady whose shining hair is a web for
hearts that in our world your beauty would dazzle
the sight of men as would a little woman sun he
said in the florid imagery to which the tongue lends
itself so well

  a flush stole up through the translucent skin
the blue eyes softened and she waved us toward
the cushions black-haired maids stole in placing
before us the fruits the little loaves and a steaming
drink somewhat the color and odor of chocolate
i was conscious of outrageous hunger

  what are you named strangers she asked

  this man is named goodwin said okeefe
as for me call me larry

  nothing like getting acquainted quick he said
to me-but kept his eyes upor yolara as though
he were voicing another honeyed phrase and so
she took it for you must teach me your tongue
she murmured

  then shall i have two words where now i have
one to tell you of your loveliness he answered

  and ai-jc thatll take time he spoke to me
essential occupation out of which we cant be
drafted to make these fun-loving folk any roman
holiday get me

  larree mused yolara  like the sound it
is sweet- and indeed it was as she spoke it

  and what is your land named larree  she con-
tinued and goodwins she caught the sound
perfectly

  my land  lady of loveliness is two-ireland
and america his but one-america

  she repeated the two names-slowly over and

over we seized the opportunity to attack the
food halting half guiltily as she spoke again

  oh but you are hungry she cried eat
then she leaned her chin upon her hands and
regarded us whole fountains of questions brimming
up in her eyes

  how is it larree that you have two countries
and goodwin but one she asked at last unable
to keep silent longer

  i was born in ireland he in america but i
have dwelt long in his land and my heart loves
each he said

  she nodded understandingly

  are all the men of ireland like you larree
as all the men here are like lugur or rador i
like to look at you she went on with naive frank-
ness i am tired of men like lugur and rador
but they are strong she added swiftly lu-
gur can hold up ten in his two arms and raise six
with but one hand

  we could not understand her numerals and she
raised white fingers to illustrate

  that is little  lady to the men of ireland
replied okeefe lo i have seen one of my race
hold up ten times ten of our-what call you that
swift thing in which rador drought us here

  corial said she

  hold up ten times twenty of our corials with

but two fingers-and these corials of ours-

coria said she

  and these coria of ours are each greater in
weight than ten of yours yes and i have seen
another with but one blow of his hand raise hell

  and so i have he murmered to me and
both at forty-second and fifth avenue n y-
u s a

  yolara considered all this with manifest doubt

  hell she inquired at last  know not the
word

  well answered okeefe say muna then
in many ways they are i gather  hearts delight
one and the same

  now the doubt in the blue eyes was strong in-
deed she shook her head

  none of our men can do that she answered
at length nor do i think you could larree

  oh no said larry easily i never tried to be
that strong i fly he added casually

the priestess rose to her feet gazing at him
with startled eyes

  fly she repeated incredulously like a zitia
a bird

  larry nodded-and then seeing the dawning com-
mand in her eyes went oji hastily

  not with my own wings yolara in a-a corial
that moves through--whats the word for air doc
-well through this- he made a wide gesture
up toward the nebulous haze above us he took a
pencil and on a white cloth made a hasty sketch
of an airplane in a-a corial like this- she re-
garded the sketch gravely thrust a hand down into
her girdle and brought forth a keen-bladed poniard
cut larrys markings out and placed the fragment
carefully aside

  that i can understand she said
the moon pool



  remarkably intelligent young woman mut-
tered okeefe hope im not giving anything
away-but she had me

  but what are your women like larree are
theylike me and how many have loved you
she whispered

  in all ireland and america there is none like
you yolara he answered and take that any
way you please he muttered in english she took
it it was evident as it most pleased her

  do you have goddesses she asked

  every woman in ireland and america is a god-
dess thus larry

  now that i do not believe there was both
anger and mockery in her eyes i know women
larree-and if that were so there would be no
peace for men

  there isnt replied he the anger died out
and she laughed sweetly understanding

  and which goddess do you worship larree
  you said larry okeefe boldly

  larry larry i whispered be careful
its high explosive

  but the priestess was laughing-little trills of
sweet bell notes and pleasure was in each note

   you are indeed bold larree she said to offer
me your worship yet i am pleased by your bold-
ness still-lugur is strong and you are not of
those who-what did you say-have tried and
your wings are not here-larree

  agajn her laughter rang out the irishman
flushed it was touch for yolara

  fear not for me with lugur he said grimly
rather fear for him

   the laughter died she looked at him searchingly
a little enigmatic smile about her mouth-so sweet
and so cruel

  well-we shall see she mur-mured you say
you battle in your world with what

  oh with this and with that answered larry

airily we manage-

  have you the keth-i mean that with which i
sent songar into the nothingness she asked
swiftly

  see what shes driving at okeefe spoke to
me swiftly well i do but heres where the
okeefe lands-
l i said he turned to her  voice of silver fire
that your spirit is high even as your beauty-and
searched out mens souls as does your loveliness
their hearts and now listen yolara for what i
speak is truth-into his eyes came the far-away
gaze into his voice the irish softness- lo in my
land of ireland this many of your lifes length
agone-see-he raised his ten fingers clenched and
unclenched them times twenty-the mighty men
of my race the taitha-da-dainn could send men
out into the nothingness even as do you with the
keth and this they did by their harpings and by
words spoken-words of power  yolara that have
their power still-and by pipings and by slaying
sounds

  there was cravetheen who played swift flames
from his harp flying flames that ate those they were
sent against and there was dalua of hy brasil
whose pipes played away from man and beast and

all living things their shadows-and at last played
them to shadows too so that wherever dalua went
his shadows that had been men and beast followed
like a storm of little rustling leaves yea and b
the harper who could make womens hearts run like
wax and mens hearts flame to ashes and whose
harpings could shatter strong cliffs and bow great
trees to the sod-

his eyes were bright dream filled she shrank
a little from him faint pallor under the perfect

skin

  i say to you yolara that these things were and
are-in ireland his voice rang strong and i
have seen men as many as those that are in your
great chamber this many times over-he clenched
his hands once more perhaps a dozen times-
blasted into nothingness before your keth could
even have touched them yea-and rocks as mighty
as those through which we came lifted up and shat-
tered before the lids could fall over your blue eyes
and this is truth yolara-all truth stay-have
you that little cone of the keth with which you de-
stroyed songar

  she nodded gazing at him fascinated fear and
puzzlement contending

  then use it he took a vase of crystal from
the table placed it on the threshold that led into
the garden use it on this-and i will show you

  i will use it upon one of the ladala- she be-
gan eagerly

  the exaltation dropped from him there was a
touch of horror in the eyes he turned to her her
own dropped before it

  it shall be as you say she said hurriedly she
drew the shining cone from her breast levelled it
at the vase the green ray leaped forth spread
over the crystal but before its action could even be
begun a flash of light shot from okeefes hand
his automatic spat and the trembling vase flew into
fragments as quickly as he had drawn it he
thrust the pistol back into place and stood there
empty handed looking at her sternly from the
anteroom came shouting a rush of feet

  yolaras face was white her eyes strained-but
her voice was unshaken as she called to the clamor-
ing guards

  it is nothing-go to your places

  but when the sound of their return had ceased
she stared tensely at the irishman-then looked
again at the shattered vase

  it is true she cried but see the keth is-
alive

  i followed her pointing finger each broken bit
of crystal was vibrating shaking its particles out
into space broken it the bullet of larrys had-
but not released it from the grip of the disintegrat-
ing force the priestess face was triumphant

  but what matters it  shining urn of beauty
-what matters it to the vase that is broken what
happens to its fragments asked larry gravely
-and pointedly

  the triumph died from her face and for a space
she was silent brooding

  next whispered okeefe to me lots of sur-


amazing stories

prises in the little box keep your eye on the open-
ing and see what comes out

  we had not longto wait there was a sparkle
of anger about yolara something too of injured
pride she clapped her hands whispered to the
maid who answered her summons and then sat
back regarding us maliciously

  you have answered me as to your strength-
but you have not proved it but the keth you have
answered now answer this she said

  she pointed out into the garden i saw a flower-
ing branch bend and snap as though a hand had
broken it-but no hand was there saw then an-
other and another bend and break a little tree
sway and fall-and closer and closer to us came the
trail of snapping boughs while down into the gar-
den poured the silvery light revealing-nothing
now a great ewer beside a pillar rose swiftly in
air and hurled itself crashing at my feet cush-
ions close to us swirled about as though in the vor-
tex of a whirlwind

  and unseen hands held my arms in a mighty
clutch fast to my sides another gripped my throat
and i felt a needle-sharp poniard pierce my shirt
touch the skin just over my heart

  larry i cried despairingly i twisted my
head saw that he too was caught in this grip of
the invisible but his face was calm even amused

  keep cool doc he said remember-she
wants to learn the language

  now from yolara burst chime upon chime of
mocking laughter she gave a command-the
hands loosened the poniard withdrew from my
heart suddenly as i had been caught i was free-
and unpleasantly weak and shaky

  have you that in ireland larree cried the
priestess-and once more trembled with laughter

  a good play yolara his voice was as calm
as his face but they did that in ireland even
before dalua piped away his first mans shadow
and in goodwins land they make ships-coria that
go on water-so you can pass by them and see only
sea and sky and those water coria are each of
them many time greater than this whole palace
of yours sjja

  but the priestess laughed on

  it did get nae a little whispered larry that
wasnt quite up lo my mark but god if we
eould find that trick out and take it back with us
not so larree yolara gasped through her
laughter not so goodwins cry betrayed
you

her good humor had entirely returned she
was like a mischievous child pleased over some
successful trick and like a child she cried-ill
show you-signalled again whispered to the
maid who quickly returning laid before her a long
metal case yolara took from her girdle some-
thing that looked like a small pencil pressed it and
shot a thin stream of light for all the world like an
electric flash upon its hasp the lid flew open
out of it she drew three flat oval crystals faint
rose in hue she handed one to okeefe and one
to me

  look she commanded placing the third before
her own eyes i peered through the stone and in-

stantly there leaped into sight out of thin air-six
grinning dwarfs each was covered from top of
head to soles of feet in a web so tenuous that
through it their bodies were plain the gauzy
stuff seemed to vibrate-its strands to run together
like quicksilver i snatched the crystal from my
eyes and-the chamber was empty put it back
-and there were the grinning six

  yolara gave another sign and they disappeared
even from the crystals

  it is what they wear larree explained yolara
graciously it is something that came to us from
-the ancient ones but we have so few-she
sighed

  such treasures must be two-edged swords yo-
lara commented okeefe for how know you
that one within them creeps not to you with hand
eager to strike

  there is no danger she said indifferently i
am the keeper of them

  she mused for a space then abruptly

  and now no more you two are to appear be-
fore the council at a certain time-but fear noth-
ing you goodwin go with rador about our city
and increase your wisdom but you larree
await me here in my garden- she smiled at him
provocatively-maliciously too for shall not one
who has resisted a world of goddesses be given all
chance to worship when at last he finds his own
she laughed-whole-heartedly and was gone
and at that moment i liked yolara better than ever
i had before and-alas-better than ever i was to
in the future

  i noted rador standing outside the open jade
door and started to go but okeefe caught me by
the arm

  wait a minute he urged about golden
eyes-you were going to tell me something-its
been on my mind all through that little sparring
match

  i told him of the vision that had passed through
my closing lids he listened gravely and then
laughed

	hell of a lot of privacy in this place he
grinned ladies who can walk through walls and
others with regular invisible cloaks to let em flit
wherever they please oh well dont let it get on
your nerves doc remember-everythings nat-
ural  that robe stuff is just camouflage of course
but lord if we could only get a piece of it

  the material simply admits all light-yibrations
or perhaps curves them just as the opacities cut
them off i answered a man on the x-ray screen
is partly invisible this makes him wholly so he
doesnt register as the people of the motion-picture
profession say

  camouflage repeated larry and as for the
shining one- say he snorted id like to set
the okeefe banshee up against it ill bet that old
resourceful irish body would give it the first three
bites and a strangle hold and wallop it before it
knew it had em oh wow boy howdy

  i heard him still chuckling gleefully over this
vision as i passed along the opal wall with the
green dwarf

  a shell was awaiting us i paused before enter-
ing it to examine the polished surface of runway
the moon pool



and great road it was obsidian-volcanic glass of
pale emerald unflawed translucent with no sign
of block or juncture i examined the shell

  what makes it go i asked rador at a word
from him the driver touched a concealed spring
and an aperture appeared beneath the control-
lever of which i have spoken in a preceding chap-
ter within was a small cube of black crystal
through whose sides i saw dimly a rapidly re-
volving glowing ball not more than two inches in
diameter beneath the cube was a curiously
shaped slender cylinder winding down into the
lower body of the nautilus whorl

  watch said rador he motioned me into the
vehicle and took a place beside me the driver
touched the lever a stream of coruscations flew
from the ball down into the cylinder the shell
started smoothly and as the tiny torrent of shining
particles increased it gathered speed

  the corial does not touch the road explained
rador it is lifted so far-he held his forefinger
and thumb less than a sixteenth of an inch apart-
above it

  and perhaps here is the best place to explain the
activation of the shells or coria the force utilized
was atomic energy passing from the whirling ball
the ions darted through the cylinder to two bands
of a peculiar metal affixed to the base of the ve-
hicles somewhat like skids of a sled impinging
upon these they produced a partial negation of

the wide glistening road was gay with the
coria they darted in and out of the gardens
within them the fair-haired extraordinarily beau-
tiful women on their cushions were like princesses
of elfland caught in gorgeous fairy webs resting
within the hearts of flowers in some shells were
flaxen-haired dwarfish men of lugurs type some-
times black-polled brother officers of rador often
raven-tressed girls plainly handmaidens of the
women and now and then beauties of the lower
folk went by with one of the blond dwarfs

  we swept around the turn that made of the

jewel-like roadway an enormous horseshoe and
speedily upon our right the cliffs through which
we had come in our journey from the moon pool
began to march forward beneath their mantels of
moss they formed a gigantic abutment a titanic
salient it had been from the very front of this
salients invading angle that we had emerged on
each side of it the precipices faintly glowing drew
back and vanished into distance

  the slender graceful bridges under which we
skimmed ended at openings in the upflung far
walls of verdure each had its little garrison of
soldiers through some of the openings a rivulet
of the green obsidian river passed these were
roadways to the farther country to the land of the
ladala rador told me adding that none of the
lesser folk could cross into the pavilioned city unless
summoned or with pass

  we turned the bend of the road and flew down
that farther emerald ribbon we had seen from the
great oval before us rose the shining cliffs and
the lake a half-mile perhaps from these the last
of the bridges flung itself it was more massive
and about it hovered a spirit of ancientness lacking
in the other spans also its garrison was larger and
at its base the tangent way was guarded by two
massive structures somewhat like blockhouses be-
tween which it ran something about it aroused
in me an intense curiosity

  where does that road lead rador i asked

  to the one place above all of whichi may not
tell you goodwin he answered and again i
wondered

  we skimmed slowly out upon the great pier far
to the left was the prismatic rainbow curtain be-
tween the cyclopean pillars on the white waters
graceful shells-lacustrian replicas of the elf
chariots-swam but none was near that distant
web of wonder

  rador-what is that i asked

  it is the veil of the shining one he answered
slowly

  was the shining one that which we named the
dweller

  what is the shining one i cried eagerly
again he was silent nor did he speak until we
had turned on our homeward way

  and lively as my interest my scientific curiosity
were-i was conscious suddenly of acute depres-
sion beautiful wondrously beautiful this place
was-and yet in its wonder dwelt a keen edge of
menace of unease-of inexplicable inhuman woe
as though in a secret garden of god a soul should
sense upon it the gaze of some lurking spirit of evil
which some way somehow had crept into the sanc-
tuary and only bided its time to spring

           the leprechaun

rt he shell carried us straight back to the

   house of yolara larry was awaiting me

  ft we stood again before the tenebrous wall
where first we had faced the priestess and the
voice and as we stood again the portal appeared
with all its disconcerting magical abruptness

  but now the scene was changed around the jet


amazing stories

table were grouped a number of figures-lugur
yolara beside him seven others-all of them fair-
haired and all men save one who sat at the left of
the priestess-an old old woman how old i could
not tell her face bearing traces of beauty that must
once have been as great as yolaras own but now
ravaged in some way awesome through its ruins
the fearful malicious gaiety shining out like a
spirit of joy held within a corpse

  began then our examination for such it was
and as it progressed i was more and more struck
by the change in the okeefe all flippancy was gone
rarely did his sense of humor reveal itself in any
of his answers he was like a cautious swordsman
fencing guarding studying his opponent or
rather like a chess-player who keeps sensing some
far-reaching purpose in the game alert contained
watchful always he stressed the power of our
surface races their multitudes their solidarity

  their questions were myriad what were our
occupations our system of government how
great were the waters the land intensely in-
terested were they in the world war just ended
querying minutely into its causes in our weapons
their interest was avid and they were exceedingly
minute in their examination of us as to the ruins
which had excited our curiosity their position and
surroundings-and if others than ourselves might
be expected to find and pass through their
entrance

  at this i shot a glance at lugur he did not
seem unduly interested i wondered if the german
had told him as yet of the girl of the rosy wall of
the moon pool chamber and the real reasons for
our search then i answered as briefly as possible
-omitting all reference to these things the red
dwarf watched me with unmistakable amusement-
and i knew von hetzdorp had told him but clearly
lugur had kept his information even from yolara
and-as clearly she had spoken to none of that epi-
sode when okeefes automatic had shattered the
zeift-smitten vase again i felt that sense of deep
bewilderment-of helpless search for clue to all the
tangle

  for two hours we were questioned and then the
priestess called rador and let us go

  larry was sombre as we returned he walked
about the room uneasily

  hells brewing here all right he said at last
stopping before me i cant make out just the
particular brand-thats all that bothers me
were going to have a stiff fight thats sure what
i want to do quick is to find the golden girl doc
havent seen her on the wall lately have you he
queried hopefully fantastic

  laugh if you want to he went on but shes
our best bet its going to be a race between her
and the okeefe banshee--but i put my money on
her i had a queer experience while i was in that
garden after youd left his voice grew solemn
did you ever see a leprechaun doc i shook my
head again as solemnly hes a little man in
green said larry oh about as high as your
knee i saw one once-in camtogher woods and
as i sat there half asleep in yolaras garden the
living spit of him stepped out from one of those
bushes twirling a little shillalah

   its a tight box yere gettin in larry avick
said he but dont ye be downhearted lad

   im carrying on said i but youre a long
way from ireland i said or thought i did

   yeve a lot o friends there he answered an
where the heart rests the feet areswift to follow
not that im sayin id like to live here larry
said he

   i know where my heart is now i told him
it rests on a girl with golden eyes and the hair
and swan-white breast of eilidh the fair-but me
feet dont seem to get me to her i said

  the brogue thickened

  an the little man in green nodded his head an
whirled his shillalah

   its what i came to tell ye says he -dont ye
fall for the bhean-nimher the serpent woman wit
the blue eyes shes a daughter of ivor lad-an
dont ye do nothin to make the brown-haired colleen
ashamed o ye larry okeefe i knew yer great
great grandfather an his before him aroon says
he an wan o the okeefe failins is to think their
hearts big enough to hold all the wimmin o the
world a hearts built to hold only wan perma-
nently larry he says an im warnin ye a nice
girl dont like to move into a place all cluttered
up wid anothers washin an mendin an cookin
an other things pertainin to general wife work
not that i think the blue-eyed wan is keen for
mendin an cookin says he

   you dont have to be cornin all this way to
tell me that i answer

   well im just a tellin you he says yeve
got some rough knocks cornin larry in fact
yere in for a very devil of a time but remember
that yere the okeefe says he an while the
bhoys are all wid ye avick yeve got to be on the
job yourself

   i hope i tell him that the okeefe banshee
can find her way here in time-that is if its neces-
sary which i hope it wont be

   dont ye worry about that says he not that
shes keen on leavin the ould sod larry the good
ould souls in quite a state o mind about ye aroon
i dont mind tellin ye lad that shes mobilizin all
the clan an if she has to come for ye avick theyll
be wid her an theyll sweep this joint clean before

thats about all larry we thought a voice from
the green isle would cheer ye dont fergit that
yere the okeefe-an i say it again--all the bhoys
are wid ye but we want t kape bein proud o ye
lad

  an i looked again and there was only a bush
waving

  there wasnt a smile in my heart-or if there
was it was a very tender one

  im going to bed he said abruptly keep
an eye on the wall doc

between the seven sleeps that followed
larry and i saw but little of each other yo-
lara sought him more and more thrice we were
called before the council once we were at a great
feast whose splendors and surprises i can never
forget largely i was in the company of rador
the moon pool



together we two passed the green barriers into the
dwelling-place of the ladala

  they seemed provided with everything needful
for life but everywhere was an oppressiveness a
gathering together of hate that was spiritual
rather than material-as tangible as the latter and
far far more menacing

  they do not like to dance with the shining
one was radors constant and only reply to my
efforts to find the cause

  once i had concrete evidence of the mood glan-
cing behind me i saw a white vengeful face peer
from behind a tree-trunk a hand lift a shining
dart speed from it straight toward radors back
instinctively i thrust him aside he turned upon
me angrily i pointed to where the little missile
lay still quivering on the ground he gripped
smy hand

  that some day i will repay he said i looked
again at the thing at its end was a tiny cone cov-
ered with a glistening gelatinous substance

  rador pulled from a tree beside us a fruit some-
what like an apple

  look he said he dropped it upon the dart-
and at once before my eyes in less than ten seconds
the fruit had rotted away

  thats what would have happened to rador but
for you friend he said

  come now between this and the prelude to the
latter half of the drama whose history this narrative
is-only scattering and necessarily fragmentary ob-
servations

  first-the nature of the ebon opacities blocking
out the spaces between the pavilion-pillars or cover-
ing their fops like roofs these were magnetic
fields light absorbers negativing the vibrations of
radiance literally screens of electric force which
formed as impervious a barrier to light as would
have been formed by screens of steel

  they instantaneously made night appear in a
place where no night was but they interposed no
obstacle to air or to sound they were extremely
simple in their inception-no more miraculous than
is glass which inversely admits the vibrations of
light but shuts out those coarser ones we call air-
and partly those others which produce upon our
auditory nerves the effects we call sound

  briefly their mechanism was this

for the same reason that dr goodwins ex-
 position of the mechanism of the atomic engines
was deleted his description of the light-destroy-
ing screens has been deleted by the executive
council-j b x president i a of s

  there were two favored classes of the ladala-
the soldiers and the dream-makers the dream-
makers were the most astonishing social pheno-
mena i think of all denied by their circumscribed
environment the wider experiences of us of the
outer world the murians had perfected an amaz-
ing system of escape through the imagination

   they were too intensely musical their favorite
instruments were double flutes immensely complex
pipe-organs harps great and small they had an-
other remarkable instrument made up of a double
octave of small drums which gave forth percussions
remarkably disturbing to the emotional centres

  it was this love of music that gave rise to one of

the few truly humorous incidents of our caverned
life larry came to me-it was just after our
fourth sleep i remember

  come on to- a concert he said

  we skimmed off to one of the bridge garrisons
rador called the twoscore guards to attention and
then to my utter stupefaction the whole company
okeefe leading them roared out the marseillaise
allons enfants de la patrie they sang- in a
closer approach to the french than might have been
expected ten or fifty miles below france level
marchons marchons they bellowed

  he quivered with suppressed mirth at my paral-
ysis of surprise

  taught em that for von hetzdorps benefit
he gasped the wars over but wait till that fel-
low hears it hell blow up

  just wait until you hear yolara lisp a pretty
little thing i taught her said larry as we set back
for what we now called home there was an impish
twinkle in his eyes

  and i did hear for it was not many minutes
later that the priestess condescended to command
me to come to her with okeefe

  show goodwin how much you have learned of
our speech  lady of the lips of honeyed flame
murmured larry

  she hesitated smiled at him and then from that
perfect mouth out of the exquisite throat in the
voice that was like the chiming of little silver bells
she trilled a melody familiar to me indeed

      shes only a bird in a gilded cage

       a bee-yu-tiful sight to see-

and so on to the bitter end

  she thinks its a love-song said larry when we
had left its only part of a repertoire im teaching
her honestly doc its the only way i can keep
my mind clear when im with her he went on earn-
estly shes a devil-ess from hell-but a wonder
whenever i find myself going i get her to sing that
or take back your gold or some other ancient lay
and im back again-pronto-with the right per-
spective pop goes all the mystery hell i say
shes only a woman 

chapter xviii
the amphitheatre of jet

for hours the black-haired folk had been
streaming across the bridges flowing along
the promenade by scores and by hundreds
drifting down toward the gigantic seven-terraced
temple whose interior i had never as yet seen and
from whose towering exterior indeed i had always
been kept far enough away-unobtrusively but none
the less decisively-to prevent any real observation
the structure i had estimated nevertheless could
not reach less than a thousand feet above its silvery
base and the diameter of its circular foundation
was about the same

  i wondered what was bringing the ladala into
lora and where they were vanishing all of them
were flower-crowned with the luminous lovely
blooms-old and young slender mocking-eyed girls
dwarfed youths mothers with their babes gnomed
oldsters-on they poured silent for the most part


amazing stories

and sullen-a sullenness that held acid bitterness
even as their subtle half-sinister half-gay malice
seemed tempered into little keen-edged flames oddly
menacingly defiant

  there were many of the green-clad soldiers along
the way and the garrison of the only bridge span i
could see had certainly been doubled

  wondering still i turned from my point of ob-
servation and made my way back to our pavilion
hoping that larry who had been with yolara for
the past two hours had returned hardly had i
reached it before rador came hurrying up in his
manner a curious exultancy mingled with what in
any one else i would have called a decided nervous-
ness

  come he commanded before i could speak
the council has made decision-and larree is
awaiting you

  what has been decided i panted as we sped
along the mosaic path that led to the house of
yolara and why is larry awaiting me

  and at his answer i felt my heart pause in its
beat and through me race a wave of mingled panic
and eagerness

  the shining one dances had answered the
green dwarf and you are to worship

  what was this dancing of the shining one of
which so often he had spoken 

  whatever my forebodings larry evidently had
none

  great stuff he cried when we had met in the
greatantechamber now empty of the dwarfs hope
it will be worth seeing-have to be something
damned good though to catch me after what ive
seen of shows at the front he added

  and remembering with a little shock of appre-
hension that he had no knowledge of the dweller
beyond my poor description of it-for there are no
words actually to describe what that miracle of in-
terwoven glory and horror was-i wondered what
larry okeefe would say and do when he did behold
it

  rador began to show impatience

   come  he urged there is much to be done-
and the time grows short

  he led us to a tiny fountain room in whose min-
iature pool the white waters were concentrated
pearl-like and opalescent in their circling rim

  bathe he commanded and set the example by
stripping himself and plunging within only a
minute or two did the green dwarf allow us and he
checked us as we were about to don our clothing

then to my intense embarrassment without
warning two of the black-haired girls entered
bearing robes of a peculiar dull-blue hue at our
manifest discomfort radors laughter roared out
he took the garments from the pair motioned them
to leave us and still laughing threw one around me
its texture was soft but decidedly metallic-like
some blue metal spun to the fineness of a spiders
thread the garment buckled tightly at the throat
was girdled at the waist and below this cincture
fell to the floor its folds being held together by a
half-dozen looped cords from the shoulders a hood
resembling a monks cowl

  rador cast this over my head it completely cov-

ered my face but was of so transparent a texture
that i could see though somewhat mistily through
it finally he handed us both a pair of long gloves
of the same material and high stockings the feet
of which were digitated-five-toed

  and again his laughter rang out at our manifest
surprise

   the priestess of the shining one does not alto-
gether trust the shining ones voice he said at
last and these are to guard against any sudden
-errors and fear not goodwin he went on
kindly not for the shining one itself would
yolara see harm come to larree here-nor because
of him to you but i would not stake much on
the great white one and for him i am sorry for
him i do like well

  is he to be with us asked larry eagerly

  he is to be where we go replied the dwarf
soberly

  grimly larry reached down and drew from his
uniform his automatic he popped a fresh clip into
the pocket fold of his girdle the pistol he slung
 high up beneath his arm-pit

  the green dwarf looked at the weapon curiously
okeefe tapped it

   this said larry slays quicker than the keth
-i take it so no harm shall come to the blue-eyed
one whose name is olaf if i should raise it--be
you not in its way rador he added significantly

  the dwarf nodded again his eyes sparkling he
thrust a hand out to both of us

  a change comes he said what it is i know
not nor how it will fall but this remember-rador
is more friend to you than you yet can know and
now let us go he ended abruptly

  he led us not through the entrance but into a
sloping passage ending in a blind wall touched a
symbol graven there and it opened precisely as had
the rosy barrier of the moon pool chamber and
just as there but far smaller was a passage end a
low curved wall facing a shaft not black as had been
that abode of living darkness but faintly lumines-
cent rador leaned over the wall the mechanism
clicked and started the door swung shut the sides
of the car slipped into place and we swept swiftly
down the passage overhead the wind whistled in
a few moments the moving platform began to slow
down it stopped in a closed chamber no larger than
itself

   rador drew his poniard and struck twice upon the
wall with its hilt immediately a panel moved away
revealing a space filled with faint misty blue radi-
ance and at each side of the opened portal stood
four of the dwarfish men grey-headed old clad in
flowing garments of white each pointing toward us
a short silver rod

   rador drew from his girdle a ring and held it out
to the first dwarf he examined it handed it to the
one beside him and not until each had inspected
the ring did they lower their curious weapons con-
tainers of that terrific energy they called the keth
i thought and later was to know that i had been
right

  we stepped out the doors closed behind us the
place was weird enough its pave was a greenish-
blue stone resembling lapis-lazuli on each side
were high pedestals holding carved figures of the
the moon pool



same material there were perhaps a score of these
but in the mistiness i could not make out their out-
lines a droning rushing roar beat upon our ears
filled the whole cavern

  i smell the sea said larry suddenly

  the roaring became deep-toned clamorous and
close in front of us a rift opened twenty feet in
width it cut the cavern floor and vanished into the
blue mist on each side the cleft was spanned by
one solid slab of rock not more than two yards wide
it had neither railing nor other protection

  the four leading priests marched out upon it one
by one and we followed in thg middle of the span
they knelt ten feet beneath us was a torrent of
blue sea-water racing with prodigious speed be-
tween polished walls it gave the impression of
vast depth it roared as it sped by and far to the
right was a low arch through which it disappeared
it was so swift that its surface shone like polished
blue steel and from it came the blessed our worldly
familiar ocean breath that strengthened my soul
amazingly and made me realize how earth-sick i
was

  whence came the stream i marvelled forgetting
for the moment as we passed on again all else
were we closer to the surface of earth than i had
thought or was this some mighty flood falling
through an opening in sea floor heaven alone knew
how many miles above us losing itself in deeper
abysses beyond these how near and how far this
was from the truth i was to learn-and never did
truth come to man in more dreadful guise

  the roaring fell away the blue haze lessened in
front of us stretched a wide flight of steps huge
as those which had led us into the courtyard of nan-
tauach through the ruined sea-gate we scaled it
it narrowed from above light poured through a still
narrower opening side by side larry and i passed
out of it

te had emerged upon an enormous platform
vv of what seemed to be glistening ivory it
stretched before us for a hundred yards or more
and then shelved gently into the white waters op-
posite-not a mile away-was that prodigious web
of woven rainbows rador had called the veil of the
shining one there it shone in all its unearthly
grandeur on each side of-the cyclopean pillars as
though a mountain should stretch up arms raising
between them a fairy banner of auroral glories
beneath it was the curved scimitar sweep of the
pier with its clustered gleaming temples

  before that bridf fascinated glance was done
there dropped upon my soul a sensation as of brood-
ing weight intolerable a spiritual oppression as
though some vastness was falling pressing stifling
me i turned-and larry caught me as i reeled

  steady steady old man he whispered

  at first all that my staggering consciousness could
realize was an immensity an immeasurable uprear-
ing that brought with it the same throat-gripping
vertigo as comes from gazing downward from some
great height-then a blur of white faces-intoler-
able shinings of hundreds upon thousands of eyes
huge incredibly huge a colossal amphitheatre of
jet a stupendous semi-circle held within its mighty
arc the ivory platform on which i stood

  it reared itself almost perpendicularly hundreds
of feet up into the sparkling heavens and thrust
down on each side its ebon bulwarks-like mon-
strous paws now the giddiness from its sheer
greatness passing i saw that it was indeed an am-
phitheatre sloping slightly backward tier after tier
and that the white blur of faces against its black-
ness the gleaming of countless eyes were those of
myriads of the people who sat silent flower-gar-
landed their gaze focused upon the rainbow curtain
and sweeping over me like a torrent-tangible ap-
palling 

  five hundred feet beyond the smooth high re-
taining wall of the amphitheatre raised itself-
above it the first terrace of the seats and above this
dividing the tiers for another half a thousand feet
upward set within them like a panel was a dead-
black surface in which shone faintly with a bluish
radiance a gigantic disk above it and around it a
cluster of innumerable smaller ones

  on each side of me bordering the platform were
scores of small pillared alcoves a low wall stretch-
ing across their fronts delicate fretted grills
shielding them save where in each lattice an open-
ing stared-it came to me that they were like those
stalls in ancient gothic cathedrals wherein for cen-
turies had kneeled paladins and people of my own
race on earths fair face and within these alcoves
were gathered score upon score the elfin beauties
the dwarfish men of the fair-haired folk at my
right a few feet from the opening through which
we had come a passageway led back between the
fretted stalls half-way between us and the mas-
sive base of the amphitheatre a dais rose up the
platform to it a wide ramp ascended and on ramp
and dais and along the centre of the gleaming plat-
form down to where it kissed the white waters a
broad ribbon of the radiant flowers lay like a fairy
carpet

  on one side of this dais meshed in a silken web
that hid no line or curve of her sweet body white
flesh gleaming through its folds stood yolara and
opposite her crowned with a circlet of flashing blue
stones his mighty body stark bare was lugur

  okeefe drew a long breath rador touched my
arm and still dazed i let myself be drawn into the
aisle and through a corridor that ran behind the
alcoves at the back of one of these the green
dwarf paused opened a door and motioned us with-
in

  entering i found that we were exactly opposite
where the ramp ran up to the dais-and that yolara
was not more than fifty feet away she glanced at
okeefe and smiled her eyes were ablaze with
little dancing points of light her body seemed to
palpitate the rounded delicate muscles beneath the
translucent skin to run with joyful little eager
waves

  larry whistled softly

  theres von hetzdorp he said

  i looked where he pointed opposite us sat the
german clothed as we were leaning forward his
eyes eager behind his glasses but if he saw us he
gave no sign

  and theres olaf said okeefe

  beneath the carved stall in which sat the german
was an aperture and within it was huldricksson


amazing stories

unprotected by pillars or by grills opening clear
upon the platform near him stretched the trail of
flowers up to the great dais which lugur and yolara
the priestess guarded he sat alone and my heart
went out to him

  okeefes face softened

  bring him here he said to rador

  the green dwarf was looking at the norseman
too a shade of pity upon his mocking face he
shook his head

  wait he said you can do nothing now-
and it may be there will be no need to do anything
he added but i could feel that there was little of
conviction in his words

chapter xix

the madness of olaf

yolara threw her white arms high from
the mountainous tiers came a mighty sigh a
rippling ran through them and upon the mo-
ment before yolaras arms fell there issued appar-
ently from the air around us a peal of sound that
might have been the shouting of some playful god
hurling great suns through the net of stars  it was
like the deepest notes of all the organs in the world
combined inone summoning majestic cosmic

  it held within it the thunder of the spheres rolling
through the infinite the birth-song of suns made
manifest in the womb of space echoes of creations
supernal chord it shook the body like a pulse from
the heart of the universe-pulsed-and died away

  on its death came a blaring as of all the trumpets
of conquering hosts since the first pharaoh led his
swarms-triumphal compelling alexanders clam-
ouring hosts brazen-throated wolf-horns of csesars
legions blare of trumpets of genghis khan and his
golden horde clangor of the locust levies of tamer-
lane bugles of napoleons armies-war-shout of all
earths conquerors and it died

  fast upon it a throbbing muffled tumult of harp
sounds mellownesses of myriads of wood horns the
subdued sweet shrilling of multitudes of flutes pan-
dean pipings-inviting carrying with them the call-
ing of waterfalls in the hidden places rushing
brooks and murmuring forest winds-calling call-
ing languorous lulling dripping into the brain like
the very honeyed essence of sound

  and after them a silence in which the memory of
the music seemed to beat to beat ever more faintly
through every quivering nerve

  from me all fear all apprehension had fled in
their place was nothing but joyous anticipation a
supernal freedom from even the shadow of the
shadow of care or sorrow not now did anything
matter-olaf or his haunted hate-fllled eyes
throckmartin or his fate-nothing of pain nothing
of agony nothing of striving or endeavor or de-
spair in that wide outer world that had turned sud-
denly to a troubled dream

  once more the first great note pealed out once
more it died and from the clustered spheres a kale-
idoscopic blaze shot as though drawn from the ma-
jestic sound itself the many-colored rays darted
across the white waters and sought the face of the
irised veil as they touched it sparkled flamed

wavered and shook with fountains of prismatic
color

  the light increased-and in its intensity the
silver air darkened faded into shadow that white
mosaic of flower-crowned faces set in the amphi-
theatre of jet and vast shadows dropped upon the
high-flung tiers and shrouded them but on the
skirts of the rays the fretted stalls in which we sat
with the fair-haired ones blazed out iridescent like
jewels

  i was sensible of an acceleration of every pulse
a wild stimulation of every nerve i felt myself
being lifted above the world-close to the threshold
of the high gods-soon their essence and their
power would stream out into me i glanced at larry
his eyes were-wild-with life

  i looked at olaf-and in his face was none of this
-only hate and hate and hate

  the peacock waves streamed out over the waters
cleaving the seeming darkness a rainbow path of
glory and the veil flashed as though all the rain-
bows that had ever shone were burning within it
again the mighty sound pealed

  into the centre of the veil the light drew itself
grew into an intolerable brightness-and with a
storm of tinklings a tempest of crystalline notes a
tumult of tiny chimings through it sped-the shin-
ing one

  straight down that radiant path its high-flung
plumes of feathery flame shimmering its coruscat-
ing spirals whirling its seven globes of seven colors
shining above its glowing core it raced toward us
the hurricane of bells of diamond glass were jubil-
ant joyous i felt okeefe grip my arm yolara
threw her white arms out in a welcoming gesture i
heard from the tiers a sigh of rapture-and in it a
poignant wailing undertone of agony

  over the waters down the light stream to the end
of the ivory pier flew the shining one through
its crystal pizzicati drifted inarticulate murmurings
-deadly sweet stilling the heart and setting it leap-
ing madly

for a moment it paused poised itself and then
came whirling down the flower path to its priest-
ess slowly ever more slowly it hovered for a
moment between the woman and the dwarf as
though contemplating them turned to her with its
storm of tinklings softened its murmurings infi-
nitely caressing bent toward it yolara seemed to
gather within herself pulsing waves of power she
was terrifying gloriously maddeningly evil and
as gloriously maddeningly heavenly  aphrodite
and the virgin tanith of the carthaginians and
st bride of the isles a queen of hell and a prin-
cess of heaven-in one

  only fcr a moment did that which we had called
the dweller and which these named the shining
one pause it swept up the ramp to the dais rested
there slowly turning plumes and spirals lacing and
unlacing throbbing pulsing now its nucleus grew
plainer stronger-human in a fashion and all in-
human neither man nor woman neither god nor
devil subtly partaking of all nor could i doubt that
whatever it was within that shining nucleus was
something sentient something that had will and

energy and in some awful supernormal fashion-
intelligence

  another trumpeting-a sound of stones opening
-a long low wail of utter anguish-something
moved shadowy in the river of light and slowly at
first then ever more rapidly shapes swam through
it there were half a score of them-girls and
youths women and men the shining one poised
itself regarded them they drew closer and in the
eyes of each and in their faces was the bud of that
awful intermingling of emotions of joy and sor-
row ecstasy and terror that i had seen in full blos-
som on throckmartins

  the thing began again its murmurings-now
infinitely caressing coaxing-like the song of a
siren from some witched star and the bell-sounds
rang out-compellingly calling-calling-calling-

   i saw olaf lean far out of his place saw half-
consciously at lugurs signal three of the dwarfs
creep in and take places unnoticed behind him

   now the first of the figures rushed upon the dais
-and paused it was the girl who had been brought
before yolara when the gnome named songar was
driven into the nothingness with all the quickness
of light a spiral of the shining one stretched out
and encircled her

  at its touch there was an infinitely dreadful
shrinking and it seemed a simultaneous hurling of
herself into its radiance as it wrapped its swirls
around her permeated her-the crystal chorus burst
forth-tumultuously through and through her the
radiance pulsed began then that infinitely
dreadful but infinitely glorious rhythm they
called the dance of the shining one and as
the girl swirled within its sparkling mists an-
other and another flew into its embrace until at
last the dais was an incredible vision a mad stars
witches sabbath an altar of white faces and
bodies gleaming through living flame transfused
with rapture insupportable and horror that was
hellish-and ever radiant plumes and spirals ex-
panding the core of the shining one waxed-grow-
ing greater-as it consumed as it drew into and
through itself the life-force of these lost ones

  so they spun interlaced-and there began to
pulse from them life vitality as though the very
essence of nature was filling us dimly i recog-
nized that what i was beholding was vamoirism in-
conceivable  the banked tiers chanted the mighty
sounds pealed forth

  it was a saturnalia of demigods

   then whirling bell-notes storming the shining
one withdrew slowly from the dais down the ramp
still embracing still interwoven with those who had
thrown themselves into its spirals they drifted
with it as though half-carried in dreadful dance
white faces sealed-forever-into that semblance of
those who held within linked god and devil-i cov-
 ered my eyes

  i heard a gasp from okeefe opened my eyes and
sought his saw the wildness vanish from them as
he strained forward olaf had leaned far out and
as he did so the dwarfs beside him caught him and
whether by design or through his own swift invol-
untary movement thrust him half into the dwellers
path the dweller paused in its gyrations-seemed
to watch him the norsemans face was crimson
his eyes blazing he threw himself back and with

one defiant shout gripped one of the dwarfs abotft
the middle and sent him hurtling through the air
straight at the radiant thing a whirling mass of
legs and arms the dwarf flew-then in mid-flight
stopped as though some gigantic invisible hand had
caught him and-was dashed down upon the plat-
form not a yard from the shining one

  like a broken spider he moved-feebly-once
twice from the dweller shot a shimmering ten-
tacle-touched him-recoiled its crystal tinklings
changed into an angry chiming from all about
-jewelled stalls and jet peak-came a sigh of in-
credulous horror

lugur leaped forward on the instant larry
was over the low barrier between the pillars
rushing to the norsemans side and even as they
ran there was another wild shout from olaf and
he hurled himself out straight at the throat of the
dweller

  but before he could touch the shining one now
motionless-and never was the thing more horrible
than then with the purely human suggestion of sur-
prise plain in its poise-larry had struck him aside

  i tried to follow-and was held by rador he
was trembling-but not with fear in his face was
incredulous hope inexplicable eagerness

  wait  he said wait

  the shining one stretched out a slow spiral and
as it did so i saw the bravest thing man has ever
witnessed instantly okeefe thrust himself be-
tween it and olaf pistol out the tentacle touched
him and the dull blue of his robe flashed out in
blinding intense azure light from the automatic
in his gloved hand came three quick bursts of flame
straight into the thing the dweller drew back
the bell-sounds swelled

  lugur paused his hands darted up and in it was
one of the silver keth cones but before he could
flash it upon the norseman larry had unlooped his
robe thrown its fold over olaf and holding him
with one hand away from the shining one thrust
with the other his pistol into the dwarfs stomach
his lips moved but i could not hear what he said
but lugur understood for his hand dropped

  now yolara was there-all this had taken barely
more than five seconds she thrust herself between
the three men and the dweller she spoke to it-
and the wild buzzing died down the gay crystal
tinklings burst forth again the thing murmured
to her-began to whirl-faster faster-passed down
the ivory pier out upon the waters bearing with it
meshed in its light the sacrifices-swept on ever
more swiftly triumphantly and turning turning
with its ghastly crew vanished through the veil

  abruptly the polychromatic path snapped out
the silver light poured in upon us from all the
amphitheatre arose a clamour a shouting von
hetzdorp his eyes staring was leaning out listen-
ing unrestrained now by rador i vaulted the wall
and rushed forward but not before i had heard the
green dwarf murmur

  there is something stronger than the shining
one two things-yea-a strong heart-and hate

  olaf panting eyes glazed trembling shrank be-
neath my hand

  the devil that took my helma i heard him
whisner the shining devil


amazing stories

  both these men lugur was raging they shall
dance with the shining one and this one too
he pointed at me malignantly

  this man is mine said the priestess and her
voice was menacing she rested her hand on larrys
shoulder he shall not dance no-nor his friend
i have told you i care not for this one she
pointed to olaf

  neither this man nor this said larry shall
be harmed this is my word yolara

  even so she answered quietly my lord

  i saw von hetzdorp stare at okeefe with a new
and curiously speculative interest lugurs eyes
grew hellish he raised his arms as though to strike
her larrys pistol prodded him rudely enough

  no rough stuff now kid said okeefe in eng-
lish the red dwarf quivered turned-caught a
robe from a priest standing by and threw it over
himself the ladala shouting gesticulating fight-
ing with the soldiers were jostling down from the
tiers of jet

  come commanded yolara-her eyes rested
upon larry your heart is great indeed-my lord
she murmured and her voice was very sweet
come

  this man comes with us yolara said okeefe
pointing to olaf

  bring him she said bring him-only tell
him to look no more upon me as before she added
fiercely

  beside her the three of us passed along the stalls
where sat the fair-haired now silent at gaze as
though in the grip of some great doubt silently
olaf strode beside me rador had disappeared
down the stairway through the hall of turquoise
mist over the rushing sea-stream we went and stood
beside the wall through which we had entered the
white-robed ones had gone

  yolara pressed the portal opened we stepped
upon the car she took the lever we raced through
the faintly luminous corridor to the house of the
priestess

  and one thing now i knew sick at heart and soul
the truth had come to me-no more need to search
for throckmartin behind that veil in the lair of
the dweller dead-alive like those we had just seen
swim in its shining train was he and edith stan-
ton and thora and olaf huldrickssons wife

nphe car came to rest the portal opened yolara
a leaped out lightly beckoned and flitted up the
corridor she paused before an ebon screen at
a touch it vanished revealing an entrance to a small
blue chamber glowing as though cut from the heart
of some gigantic sapphire bare save that in its
centre upon a low pedestal stood a great globe fash-
ioned from milky rock-crystal upon its surface
were faint tracings as of seas and continents but
if so either of some other world or of this world in
immemorial past for in no way did they resemble
the mapped coast lines of our earth

  poised upon the globe rising from it out into
space locked in each others arms lips to lips were
two- figures a woman and a man so exquisite so
lifelike that for the moment i failed to realize that
they too were carved of the crystal and before
this shrine-for nothing else could it be i knew-

three slender cones raised themselves one of purest
white flame one of opalescent water and the third
of-moonlight  there was no mistaking them the
height of a tall man each stood-but how water
flame and light were held so evenly so steadily in
their spire-shapes i could not tell

  yblara bowed lowly-once twice thrice she
turned to okeefe nor by slightest look or gesture
betrayed she knew others than he were there the
blue eyes wide searching unfathomable she drew
close put white hands on his shoulders looked
down into his very soul

  my lord she murmured now listen well for
i yolara give you three things-myself and the
shining one and the power that is the shining
ones-yea and still a fourth thing that is all three
-power over all upon that world from whence you
came these my lord ye shall have i swear it
-she turned toward the altar-uplifted her arms
-by siya and by siyana and by the flame by the
water and by the light

  her eyes grew purple dark

  let none dare to take you from me nor ye
go from me unbidden she whispered fiercely

  then swiftly still ignoring us she threw her
arms about okeefe pressed her white body to his
breast lips raised eyes closed seeking his
okeefes arms tightened around her - his head
dropped lips seeking finding hers-passionately
from - olaf came a deep indrawn breath that was
almost a groan but not in my heart could i find
blame for the irishman

  the priestess opened eyes now all misty blue
thrust him back stood regarding him okeefe
dead-white raised a trembling hand to his face

  and thus have i sealed my oath  my lord
she whispered for the first time she seemed to
recognize our presence stared at us a moment
then through us and turned to okeefe

  go now she said soon rador shall come for
you then-well after that let happen what will

  she smiled once more at him-so sweetly
turned toward the figures upon the great globe
sank upon her knees before them quietly we
crept away still silent made our way to the little
pavilion but as we passed we heard a tumult
from the green roadway shouts of men now and

    have no space here even to outline the eschatology
of this people nor to catalogue their pantheon siya and
siyana typified worldly love  their ritual was however
singularly free from those degrading elements usually found
in love-cults priests and priestesses of all cults dwelt in
the immense seven-terraced structure of which the- jet
amphitheatre was the water side the symbol icon repre-
sentation of siya and siyana-the globe and the up-striving
figures typified earthly love feet bound to earth but eyes
among the stars hell or heaven i never heard formulated
nor their equivalents unless that existence in the shining
ones domain could serve for either over all this was
thanaroa remote unheeding but still maker and ruler of
all-an absentee first cause personified thanaroa seemed
to be the one article of belief in the creed of the soldiers-
rador with his reverence for the ancient ones was an
exception whatever there was indeed of high truly re-
ligious impulse among the murians this high god possessed 

i	foud this exceedingly interesting because it had long
been my theory-to put the matter in the shape of a geom-
etrical formula-that the real attractiveness of gods to man
increases uniformly according to the square of their dis-
tance-w t g
the moon pool



then a womans scream through a rift in the
garden i glimpsed a jostling crowd on one of the
bridges green dwarfs struggling with the ladala-
and all about droned a humming as of a giant hive
disturbed

  larry threw himself down upon one of the divans
covered his face with his hands dropped them to
catch troubled reproach in olafs eyes and looked
at me

  i couldnt help it he said half defiantly-half-
miserably god what a woman i couldnt
help it

  larry i asked why didnt you tell her you
didnt love her-then

  he gazed at me-the old twinkle back in his eye

  spoken like a scientist doc he exclaimed i
suppose if a burning angel struck you out of no-
where and threw itself about you you would most
dignifiedly tell it you didnt want to be burned for
gods sake dont talk nonsense goodwin he
ended almost peevishly

  evil evil the norsemans voice was deep
nearly a chant all here is of evil trolldom
and helvede it is ja and that she djaeveuk of
beauty-what is she but harlot of that shining devil
they worship i olaf huldricksson know what
she meant when she held out to you power over all
the world ja-as if the world had not devils
enough in it now

  what the cry came from both okeefe and
myself at once

  olaf made a gesture of caution relapsed into
sullen silence there were footsteps on the path
and into sight came rador-but a rador changed
gone was every vestige of his mockery curiously
solemn he saluted okeefe and olaf with that
salute which before this i had seen given only to
yolara and to lugur there came a swift quicken-
ing of the tumult-died away he shrugged
mighty shoulders

  the ladala are awake he said so much for
what two brave men can do he paused thought-
fully bones and dust jostle not each other for
place against the grave wall he added oddly but
if bones and dust have revealed to them that they
still-live-

  he stopped abruptly eyes seeking the globe that
bore and sent forth speech

    i find that i have neglected to explain the working of
these interesting mechanisms that were telephonic dicta-
phonic telegraphic in one i must assume that my readers
are familiar with the receiving apparatus of wireless teleg-
raphy which must be tuned by the operator until its own
vibratory quality is in exact harmony with the vibrations-
the extremely rapid impacts-of those short electric wave-
lengths we call hertzian and which carry the wireless
messages i must assume also that they are familiar with
the elementary fact of physics that the vibrations of light
and sound are interchangeable the hearing-talking globes
utilize both these principles and with consummate sim-
plicity the light with which they shone was produced by
an atomic motor within their base similar to that whieh
activated the merely illuminating globes the composition
of the phonic spheres gave their surfaces an acute sensitivity
and resonance in conjunction with its energizing power
the metal set up what is called a field of force which
linked it with every particle of its kind no matter how dis-
tant when vibrations of speech impinged upon the resonant
surface its rhythmic light-vibrations were broken just as a
telephone transmitter breaks an electric current simultan-
eously these light-vibrations were changed into sound-on the

  the afyo maie has sent me to watch over you
till she summons you he announced clearly
there is to be a-feast you larree you good-
win are to come i remain here with-olaf

  no harm to him broke in okeefe sharply
rador touched his heart his eyes

  by the ancient ones and by my love for you
and by what you twain did before the shining one
-i swear it he whispered

  rador clapped palms a soldier came round the
path in his grip a long flat box of polished wood
the green dwarf took it dismissed him threw
open the lid

  here is your apparel for the feast larree he
said pointing to the contents

  okeefe stared reached down and drew out a
white shimmering softly metallic long-sleeved
tunic a broad silvery girdle leg swathings of the
same argent material and sandals that seemed to
be cut out from silver he made a quick gesture of
angry dissent

  nay larree muttered the dwarf wear
them-i counsel it-i pray it-ask me not why
he went on swiftly looking again at the globe

  okeefe as i was impressed by his earnestness
the dwarf made a curiously expressive pleading
gesture okeefe abruptly took the garments
passed into the room of the fountain

  the shining one dances not again i asked

  no he said no-he hesitated-it is the
usual feast that follows the-sacrament lugur
-and double tongue who came with you will be
there he added slowly

  lugur- i gasped in astonishment after
what happened-he will be there

  perhaps because of what happened goodwin
my friend he answered-his eyes again full of
malice and there will be others-friends of yo-
lara-friends of lugur-and perhaps another-
his voice was almost inaudible-one whom they
have not called- he halted half-fearfully glanc-
ing at the globe put finger to lips and spread him-
self out upon one of the couches

  strike up the band-came okeefes voice-
here comes the hero

  he strode into the room i am bound to say
that the admiration in radors eyes was reflected
in my own and even if involuntarily in olafs

  a son of siyana whispered rador

  he knelt took from his girdle-pouch a silk-
wrapped something unwound it-and still kneel-
ing drew out a slender poniard of gleaming white
metal hilted with the blue stones he thrust it into
okeefes girdle then gave him again the rare
salute

  come he ordered and took us to the head of the
pathway

  now he said grimly let the silent ones show
their power-if they still have it

  and with this strange benediction he turned
back

surfaces of all spheres tuned to that particular instrument
the crawling colors which showed themselves at these
times were literally the voice of the speaker in its spectrum
equivalent while usually the sounds produced required
considerable familiarity with the apparatus to be understood
quickly they could on occasion be made startlingly loud
and clear-as i was soon to realize-w t g


amazing stories

  for gods sake larry i urged as we ap-
proached the house of the priestess youll be
careful

  he nodded-but i saw with a little deadly pang
of apprehension in my heart a puzzled lurking
doubt within his eyes

  as we ascended the serpent steps von hetzdorp
appeared he gave a signal to our guards-and i
wondered what influence the german had attained
for promptly without question they drew aside
at me he smiled amiably

  have you found your friends yet he went
on-and now i sensed something deeply sinister in
him no it is too bad well dont give up
hope he turned to okeefe

  lieutenant i would like to speak to you-
alone

 ive no secrets from goodwin answered
okeefe

  so queried von hetzdorp suavely he bent
whispered to larry

  the irishman started eyed him with a certain
shocked incredulity then turned to me

  just a minute doc he said and i caught the
suspicion of a wink they drew aside out of ear-
shot the german talked rapidly larry was all
attention vos hetzdorps earnestness became in-
tense okeefe interrupted-appeared to question
von hetzdorp glanced at me and as his gaze shifted
from okeefe i saw a flame of rage and horror
blaze up in the latters eyes at last the irishman
appeared to consider gravely nodded as though
he had arrived at some decision and von hetzdorp
thrust his hand to him

  and only i could have noticed larrys shrinking
his microscopic hesitation before he took it and
his involuntary movement as though to shake off
something unclean when the clasp had ended

  von hetzdorp without another look at me
turned and went quickly within the guards took
their places i looked at larry inquiringly

  dont ask a thing now doc he said tensely
wait till we get home but weve got to get
damned busy and quick-ill tell you that now-

chapter xx
the tempting of larry

tt e paused before thick curtains through
j which came the faint murmur of many

 t t voices they parted out came two-
ushers i suppose they were-in cuirasses and kilts
that reminded me somewhat of chain-mail-the first
armor of any kind here that i had seen they held
open the folds

  the chamber on whose threshold we stood was
far larger than either anteroom or hall of audience
not less than three hundred feet long and half that
in depth from end to end of it ran two huge semi-
elliptical tables paralleling each other divided by
a wide aisle and heaped with flowers with fruits
with viands unknown to me and glittering with
crystal flagons beakers goblets of as many hues
as the blooms on the gay-cushioned couches that
flanked the tables lounging luxuriously were scores
of the fair-haired ruling class and there rose a
little buzz of admiration oddly mixed with a half-

startled amaze as their gaze fell upon okeefe in
all his silvery magnificence everywhere the light-
giving globes sent their roseate radiance

  the cuirassed dwarfs led us through the aisle
within the rc of the inner half-circle was another
glittering board an oval but of those seated there
facing us-i had eyes for only one-yolara she
swayed up to greet okeefe-and she was like one
of those white lily maids whose beauty hoang-ku
the sage says made the gobi first a paradise and
whose lusts later made it the burned-out desert
that it is she held out hands to larry andon her
face was passion-unashamed unhiding

  she was circe-but circe conquered webs of
filmiest white clung to the rose-leaf body twisted
through the corn-silk hair a threaded circlet of pale
sapphires shone but they were pale beside yo-
laras eyes okeefe bent kissed her hands some-
thing more than mere admiration flaming from
him she saw-and smiling drew him down be-
side her

  it came to me that of all only these two yolara
and okeefe were in white-and i wondered then
with a tightening of nerves ceased to wonder as
there entered-lugur he was all in scarlet and
as he strode forward a silence fell-a tense
strained silence

  his gaze turned upon yolara rested upon
okeefe and instantly his face grew-dreadful-
there is no other word than that for it von hetz-
dorp leaned forward from the centre of the table
near whose end i sat touched and whispered to
him swiftly with appalling effort the red dwarf
controlled himself he saluted the priestess iron-
ically i thought took his place at the further end
of the oval and now i noted that the figures be-
tween were the seven of that council of which the
shining ones priestess and voice were the heads
the tension relaxed but did not pass-as though
a storm-cloud should turn away but still lurk
threatening

my gaze ran back this end of the room was
draped with the exquisitely colored graceful
curtains looped with gorgeous garlands between
curtains and table where sat larry and the nine
a circular platform perhaps ten yards in diameter
raised itself a few feet above the floor its gleaming
surface half-covered with the luminous petals
fragrant delicate

  on each side below it were low carven stools
the curtains parted and girls softly entered bear-
ing their flutes their harps the curiously emotion-
exciting octaved drums they sank into their
places they touched their instruments a faint
languorous measure throbbed through the rosy air

  the stage was set what was tobe the play

  now about the tables passed other dusky-haired
maids fair bosoms bare their scanty kirtles looped
high pouring out the wines for the feasters

  my eyes sought okeefe whatever it had been
that von hetzdorp had said clearly it now filled
his mind-even to the exclusion of the wondrous
woman beside him his eyes were stem cold-
and now and then as he turned them toward the
german filled with a curious speculation yolara
the moon pool	

watched him frowned gave a low order to the
hebe behind her

  the girl disappeared entered again with a ewer
that seemed cut of amber the priestess poured
from it into larrys glass a clear liquid that shook
with tiny sparkles of light she raised the glass to
her lips handed it to him half-smiling half-
abstractedly he took it touched his own lips where
hers had kissed drained it a nod from yolara
and the maid refilled his goblet

  at once there was a swift transformation in the
irishman his abstraction vanished the sternness
fled his eyes sparkled he leaned caressingly
toward yolara whispered her blue eyes flashed
triumphantly her chiming laughter rang she
raised her own glass-but within it was not that
clear drink that filled larrys and again he
drained his own and lifting it full once more
caught the baleful eyes of lugur and held it
toward him mockingly yolara swayed close-
alluring tempting he arose face all reckless
gaiety rollicking deviltry

  a toast he cried in english to the shining
one-and may the hell where it belongs soon claim
it

  he had used their own word for their god-all
else had been in his own tongue and so for-
tunately they did not understand but the con-
tempt in his action they did recognize-and a dead
fearful silence fell upon them all lugurs eyes
blazed little sparks of crimson in their green the
priestess reached up caught at okeefe he seized
the soft hand caressed it his gaze grew far away
sombre

  the shining one he spoke low an now
again i see the faces of those who dance with it
it is the fires of mora-come god alone knows
how-from erin-to this place the fires of
mora he  contemplated the hushed folk before
him and then from his lips came that weirdest
most haunting of the lyric  legends of erin-the
curse of mora

  the fretted fires of mora blew oer him in the
         nighf

  he thrills no more to loving nor weeps for
        past delight

  for when those flames have bitten both grief
         and joy take flight-

  again yolara tried to draw him down beside
her and once more he gripped her hand his
eyes grew fixed-he crooned

  and through the sleeping silence his feet must
         track the tune

  when the world is barred and speckled with
        silver of the moon-

  he stood swaying for a moment and then
laughing let the priestess have her way drained
again the glass

  and now my heart was cold indeed-for what
hope was there left with larry mad wild drunk

  the silence was unbroken-elfin women and
dwarfs glancing furtively at each other but now
yolara arose face set eyes flashing grey

  hear you the council and you lugur-and
all who are here she cried now i the priestess
of the shining one take as is my right my mate
and this is he she pointed down upon larry
he glanced up at her

  	cant quite make out what you say yolara
he muttered thickly i but say anything-you like
-i love your voice

  i turned sick with dread yolaras hand stole
softly upon the irishmans curls caressingly

  you know the law yolara lugurs voice was
flat deadly you may not mate with other than
your own kind and this man is a stranger-a bar-
barian-food for the shining one literally he
spat the phrase

  no not of our kind-lugur-higher yolara
answered serenely lo a son of siya and of
siyana

  a lie roared the red dwarf a lie

  the shining one revealed it to me said yolara
sweetly and if ye believe not lugur-go ask of
the shining one if it be not truth

 i here was bitter nameless menace in those
last words-and whatever their hidden message
to lugur it was potent he stood choking face
hell-shadowed-von hetzdorp leaned out again
whispered the red dwarf bowed now wholly iron-
ically resumed his place and his silence and
again i wondered icy-hearted what was the power
the german had so to sway lugur

  what says the council yolara demanded
turning to them

  only for a moment they consulted among them-
selves then the woman whose face was a ravaged
shrine of beauty spoke

  the will of the priestess is the will of the coun-
cil she answered

  defiance died from yolaras face she looked
down at larry tenderly he sat swaying crooning

  bid the priests come she commanded then
turned to the silent room by the rites of siya
and siyana yolara takes their son for her mate
and again her hand stole down possessingly ser-
pent soft to the drunken head of the okeefe

  the curtains parted widely through them filed
two by two twelve hooded figures clad in flowing
robes of the green we see in forest vistas of open-
ing buds of dawning spring of each pair one bore
clasped to breast a globe of that milky crystal in
the sapphire shrine-room the other a harp small
shaped somewhat likethe ancient clarsach of the
druids

  two by two they stepped upon the raised plat-
form placed gently upon it each their globe and
two by two crouched behind them they formed
now a star of six points about the petalled dais and
simultaneously they drew from their faces the cov-
ering cowls

  i half rose-youth and maidens these of the fair-
haired and youths and maids more beautiful than
any of those i had yet seen-for upon their faces
was little of that disturbing mockery to which i
have been forced so often because of the deep im-
pression it made upon me to refer the ashen-gold
of the maiden priestesses hair was wound about
their brows in shining coronals the pale locks


amazing stories

 of the youths were clustered within circlets of
 translucent glimmering gems like moon-stones
 and then crystal globe alternately before and harp
 alternately held by youth and maid they began to
 sing

   what was that song i do not know-nor ever
 -shall archaic ancient beyond thought it seemed
 -not with the ancientness of things that for un-
 counted ages have been but wind-driven dust
 rather was it the ancientness of the golden youth
 of the world love lilts of earth younglings with
 light of new born suns drenching them chorals of
 young stars mating in space murmurings of april
 gods and goddesses a languor stole through me
 the rosy lights uponthe tripods began to die away
 and as they faded the milky globes gleamed forth
 brighter ever brighter yolara rose stretched a
 hand to larry led him through the sextuple groups
 and stood face to face with him in the centre of
 their circle

   the rose-light died all that immense chamber
 was black save for the circle of glowing spheres
 within this their milky radiance grew brighter-
 brighter the song whispered away a throb-
 bing arpeggio dripped from the harps and as the
 notes pulsed out up from the globes as though
 striving to follow pulsed with them tips of moon-
 fire cones such as i had seen before yolaras altar
 weirdly caressingly compellingly the harp notes
 throbbed in repeated re-repeated theme holding
 within itself the same archaic golden quality i had
 noted in the singing and over the moon flame
 pinnacles rose higher

   yolara lifted her arms within her hands were
 clasped okeefes she raised them above their
 two heads and slowly slowly drew him with her
 into a circling graceful step tendrillings delicate
 as the slow spiralling of twilight mist upon some
 still stream

   as they swayed the rippling arpeggios grew
 louder and suddenly the slender pinnacles of moon
 fire bent dipped flowed to the floor crept in a shin-
 ing ring around those two-and began to rise a
 gleaming glimmering enchanted barrier-rising
 ever rising-hiding them

   with one swift movement yolara unbound her
 circlet of pale sapphires shook loose the waves of
 her silken hair it fell a rippling wondrous cas-
 cade veiling both her and okeefe to their girdles
 -and now the shining coils of moon fire had crept
 to their knees-circling higher-higher

   and ever despair grew deeper in my sou

   what was that i started to my feet and all
 around me in the blackness i heard startled mo-
 tion from without came a blaring of trumpets
 the sound of running menloud murmurings the
 tumult drew closer i heard cries of lakla
 lakla now it was at the very threshold and
 within it oddly as though punctuating the
 clamor a deep-toned almost abyssmal booming
 sound thunderously bass and reverberant

   abruptly the hypings ceased the moon fires
 shuddered fell and began to sweep hack into the
 crystal globes yolaras swaying form grew rigid
 every atom of it listening she threw aside the
 veiling cloud of hair and in the gleam of the last

retreating spirals her face glared out like some
old greek mask of tragedy

  the sweet lips that even at their sweetest could
never lose their delicate cruelty had no sweetness
now they were drawn into a square-inhuman
as that of the medusa in her eyes were the fires of
the pit and her hair seemed to writhe like the ser-
pent locks of that gorgon whose mouth she had
borrowed all her beauty was transformed into a
nameless thing-hideous inhuman blasting if
this was the true soul of yolara springing to her
face then i thought god help us in very deed

  i wrested my gaze away to okeefe all drunk-
enness gone himself again he was staring down
at her and in his eyes were loathing and horror
unutterable so they stood-and the light fled

only for a moment did the darkness hold
with lightning swiftness the blackness that
was the chambers other wall vanished through
a portal open between grey screens the silver spar-
kling radiance poured

  and through the portal marched two by two
incredible nightmare figures-frog-men giants
taller by nearly a yard than even tall okeefe
their enormous saucer eyes were irised by wide
bands of green-flecked red in which the phosphor-
escence flickered their long muzzles lips half-
open in monstrous grin held rows of glistening
slender lancet sharp fangs over the glaring eyes
arose a horny helmet a carapace of black and
orange scales studded with foot-long lance-headed
horns

  they lined themselves like soldiers on each side
of the wide table aisle and now i could see that
their horny armor covered shoulders and backs ran
across the chest in knobbed cuirass and at wrists
and heels jutted out into curved murderous spurs
the webbed hands and feet ended in yellow spade-
shaped claws

  they carried spears ten feet at least in length
the heads of which were pointed cones glistening
with that same covering from whose touch of swift
decay i had so narrowly saved rador

  they were grotesque yes-more grotesque than
anything i had ever seen or dreamed and they
were-terrible

  and then quietly through their ranks came-a
girl behind her enormous pouch at his throat
swelling in and out menacingly in one paw a tree-
like spike-studded mace a frog-man huger than
any of the others guarding but of him i caught
but a fleeting involuntary impression-all my gaze
was for her

  for it was she who had pointed out to us the
way from the peril of the dwellers lair on nan-
tauach and as i looked at her i marvelled that
ever could i have thought the priestess more beau-
tiful into the eyes of okeefe rushed joy and an
utter abasement of shame

  and from all about came murmurs-edged with
anger half-incredulous tinged with fear

  lakla

  lakla

  the handmaiden

  she halted close beside me from firm little chin
to dainty buskined feet she was swathed in soft
the moon pool



robes of dull almost coppery hue the left arm
was hidden the right free and gloved wound
tight about it was one of the vines of the sculp-
tured wall and of lugurs circled signet-ring
thick a vivid green its tendrils ran between
her fingers stretching out four flowered heads that
gleamed like blossoms cut from gigantic glowing
rubies

  so she stood contemplating yolara then drawn
perhaps by my gaze she dropped her eyes upon
me golden translucent with tiny flecks of amber
in their aureate irises the soul that looked through
them was as far removed from that flaming out
of the priestesss as zenith above nadir

  i noted the low broad brow the proud little nose
the tender mouth and the soft-sunlight-glow
that seemed to transfuse the delicate skin and
suddenly in the eyes dawned a smile-sweet
friendly a touch of roguishness profoundly re-
assuring in its all humanness i felt my heart ex-
pand as though freed from fetters a recrudescence
of confidence in the essential reality of things-as
though in nightmare the struggling consciousness
should glimpse some familiar face and know that
the terrors with which it strove were dreams and
involuntarily i smiled back at her

she raised her head and looked again at yolara
contempt and a certain curiosity in her gaze
at okeefe-and through the softened eyes drifted
swiftly a shadow of sorrow and on its fleeting
wings deepest interest and hovering over that a
naive approval as reassuringly human as had been
her smile

  she spoke and her voice deep-timbred iiquid
gold as was yolaras all silver was subtly the syn-
thesis of all the golden glowing beauty of her

  the silent ones have sent me  yolara she
said and this is their command to you-that
you deliver to me to bring before them three of
the four strangers who have found their way here
for him there who plots with lugur-she pointed
at von hetzdorp and i saw yolara start-they
have no need into his heart the silent ones have
looked and lugur and you may keep him
yolara

  there was honeyed venom in the last words

  yolara was herself now only the edge of shrill-
ness on her voice revealed her wrath as she an-
swered

  and whence have the silent ones gained power
to command choya

  this last i knew was a very vulgar word i had
heard rador use it in a moment of anger to one of
the serving maids and it meant approximately
kitchen girl scullion beneath the insult and
the acid disdain the blood rushed up under laklas
ambered ivory skin

  yolara-her voice was low-of no use is it
to question me i am but the messenger of the
silent ones and one thing only am i bidden to
ask you-do you deliver to me the three strangers

  lugur was on his feet eagerness sardonic de-
light sinister anticipation thrilling from him-
and my same glance showed von hetzdorp
crouched biting his finger-nails glaring at the
golden girl

  no yolara spat the word no now by
thanaroa and by the shining one no her eyes
blazed her nostrils were wide in her fair throat
a little pulse beat angrily you lakla-take you
my message to the silent ones say to them that
i keep this man-she pointed to larry-because
he is mine say to them that i keep the yellow-
haired one and him-she pointed to me-because
it pleases me

  tell them that upon their mouths i place my
foot so-she stamped upon the dais viciously-
and that in their faces i spit-and her action
was hideously snakelike and say last to them
you handmaiden that if you they dare send to yo-
lara again she will feed you to the shining one
now-go

  the handmaidens face was white

  not unforeseen by the three was this yolara
she replied and did you speak as you have
spoken then was i bidden to say this to you her
voice deepened three tal have you to take coun-
sel yolara and at the end of that time these
things must you have determined-either to do or
not to do first send the strangers to the silent
ones second give up you and lugur and all of
you that dream you have of conquest of the world
without and third foreswear the shining one
and if you do not one and all these things then
are you done your cup of life broken your wine of
life spilled yea yolara for you and the shining
one lugur and the nine and all those here and
their kind shall pass this say the silent ones
surely shall all of ye pass and be as though never
had ye been 

  now a gasp of rage and fear arose from all those
around me-but the priestess threw back her head
and laughed loud and long into the silver sweet
chiming of her lughter clashed that of lugur-
and after a little the nobles took it up till the
whole chamber echoed with their mirth okeefe
lips tightening moved toward the handmaiden and
almost imperceptibly but peremptorily she waved
him back

  those are great words-great words indeed
choya shrilled yolara at last and again lakla
winced beneath the word lo for laya upon laya
the shining one has been freed from the three
and for laya upon laya they have sat helpless rot-
ting now i ask you again-whence comes their
power to lay their will upon me and whence comes
their strength to wrestle with the shining one and
the beloved of the shining one

  and again she laughed-and again lugur and
all the fair-haired joined in her laughter

  into the eyes of lakla i saw creep a doubt a
wavering as though deep within her the founda-
tions of her own belief were none too firm

che hesitated turning upon okeefe gaze in
 which rested more than suggestion of appeal
and yolara saw too for she flushed with triumph
stretched a finger toward the handmaiden

  look she cried look hy even she does

not believe her voice grew silk of silver

merciless cruel now am i minded to send an-
other answer to the silent ones yea but not
by you lakla by these-she pointed to the frog-


amazing stories

men and swift as light her hand darted into her
bosom bringing forth the little shining cone of
death

  but before she could level it the golden girl had
released that hidden left arm and thrown over her
face a fold of the metallic swathings swifter than
yolara she raised the arm that held the vine-and
now i knew this was no inert blossoming thing

  it was alive

  it writhed down her arm and its four rubescent
flower heads thrust out toward the priestess-vi-
brating quivering held in leash only by the light
touch of the handmaiden at its very end

  from the swelling throat pouch of the monster
behind her came a succession of the reverberant
boomings the frog-men wheeled raised their
lances leveled them at the throng around the
reaching ruby flowers a faint red mist swiftly grew

  the silver cone dropped from yolaras rigid fin-
gers her eyes grew stark with horror all her un-
earthly loveliness fled from her she stood pale-
lipped the handmaiden dropped the protecting
veil--and now it was she who laughed

  it would seem then yolara that there is a
thing of the silent ones ye fear she said well
-the kiss of the yekta i promise you in return for
the embrace of your shining one

  she looked at larry long searchingly and sud-
denly again with all that effect of sunlight bursting
into dark places her smile shone upon him she
nodded half gaily looked down upon me the little
merry light dancing in her eyes waved her hand
to me

  she spoke to the giant frog-man he wheeled
behind her as she turned facing the priestess club
upraised fangs glistening his troop moved not
a jot spears held high lakla began to pass
slowly-almost i thought tauntingly-and as she
reached the portal larry leaped from the dais

  alanna he cried youll not be leavin me
just when ive found you

  in his excitement he spoke in his own tongue
the velvet brogue appealing lakla turned con-
templated okeefe hesitant unquestionably long-
ingly irresistibly like a child making up her mind
whether she dared or dared not take a delectable
something offered her

  i go with you said okeefe this time in her
own speech come on doc he reached out a
hand to me

 but now yolara spoke life and beauty had
flowed back into her face and in the purple eyes
all her hosts of devils were gathered

  do you forget what i promised you before siya
and siyana and do you think that you can leave
me-me-as though i were a choya-like her
she painted to lakla do you-

  now listen yolara larry interrupted almost
plaintively no promise has passed from me to
you-and why would you hold me he passed
unconsciously into english be a good sport yo-
lara he urged you have got a very devil of a
temper you know and so have i and wed be really
awfully uncomfortable together and why dont
you get rid of that devilish pet of yours and be
good

  she looked at him puzzled von hetzdorp leaned

over translated to lugur the red dwarf smiled
maliciously drew near the priestess whispered to
her what was without doubt as near as he could
come in the murian to larrys own very colloquial
phrases

  yolaras lips writhed

  hear me lakla she cried now would i not
let you take this man from me were i to dwell ten
thousand laya in the agony of yektas kiss this i
swear to you-by thanaroa by my heart and by
my strength-and may my strength wither my
heart rot in my breast and thanaroa forget me if
i do

  listen yolara- began okeefe again

  be silent you it was almost a shriek and
her hand again sought in her breast for the cone
of rhythmic death

  lugur touched her arm whispered again the
glint of guile shone in her eyes she laughed softly
relaxed

  the silent ones lakla bade you say that they
-allowed-me three tal to decide she said suave-
ly go now in peace lakla and say that yolara
has heard and that for three tal they-allow-her
she will take council

  the handmaiden hesitated

  the silent ones have said it she answered at
last stay you here strangers-the long lashes
drooped as her eyes met okeefes and a hint of
blush was in her cheeks-stay you here strangers
till then but yolara see you on that heart and
strength you have sworn by that they come to no
harm-else that which you have invoked shall come
upon you swiftly indeed-and that i promise you
she added

  their eyes met clashed burned into each other
-black flame from abaddon and golden flame from
paradise

  remember said lakla and passed through the
portal the gigantic frog-man boomed a thunder-
ous note of command his grotesque guards turned
and slowly followed their mistress and last of all
passed out the monster with the mace

           chapter xxi
           larrys defiance

 a clamor arose from all the chamber

 stilled in an instant by a motion of yolaras
jl hand she stood silent regarding okeefe
with something other now than blind wrath some-
thing half regretful half beseeching but the
irishmans control was gone

  yolara-his voice shook with rage and he
threw caution to the wind-now hear me i go
where i will and when i will here shall we stay
until the time she named is come and then we
follow her whether you will or not and if any
should  have thought to stop us-tell them of that
flame that shattered the vase he added grimly

  the wistfulness died out of her eyes leaving
them cold but no answer made she to him

  what lakla has said the council must con-
sider and at once the priestess was facing the
nobles now friends of mine and friends of
lugur must all feud all rancor between us end
she glanced swiftly at lugur the ladala are
the moon pool



stirring and the silent ones threaten yet fear
not-for are we not strong under the shining one
and now-leave us

  her hand dropped to the table and she gave
evidently a signal for in marched a dozen or more
of the green dwarfs

  take these two to their place she commanded
pointing to us

  the green dwarfs clustered about us without
another look at the priestess okeefe marched be-
side me between them from the chamber and it
was not until we had reached the pillared entrance
that larry spoke

  i hated to talk like that to a woman doc he
said and a pretty woman at that but first she
played me with a marked deck and then not only
pinched all the chips but drew a gun on me what
the hell-she nearly had me-married-to her i
dont know what the stuff was she gave me but
take it from me if i had the recipe for that brew
i could sell it for a thousand dollars a jolt at forty-
second and broadway

  one jigger of it and you forget there is a trou-
ble in the world three of them and you forget
there is a world no excuse for it doc and i dont
care what you say or what lakla may say-it
wasnt my fault and i dont hold it up against my-
self for a damn

  i must admit that im a bit uneasy about her
threats i said ignoring all this he stopped
abruptly

  whatre you afraid of

  mostly i answered dryly i have no desire
to dance with the shining one

  listen to me goodwin he took up his walk
impatiently ive all the love and admiration for
you in the world but this place has got your nerve
hereafter one larry okeefe of ireland and the
little old u s a leads this party nix on the
tremolo stop nix on the superstition im the
works get me 

  yes i get you i exclaimed testily enough
but to use your own phrase kindly can the re-
peated references to superstition

  why should i he was almost wrathful
you scientific people build up whole philosophies
on the basis of things you never saw and you scoff
at people who believe in other things that you think
they never saw and that dont come under what you
label scientific you talk about paradoxes-why
your scientist who thinks he is the most skeptical
the most materialistic aggregation of atoms ever
gathered at the exact mathematical centre of mis-
souri has more blind faith than a dervish and more
credulity more superstition than a cross-eyed
nigger beating it past a country graveyard in the
dark of the moon

  larry i cried dazed

  olafs no better he said but i can make al-
lowances for him hes a sailor no sir what
this expedition needs is a man without superstition
and remember this the leprechaun promised that
id have full warning before anything happened
and if we do have to go out well see that banshee
hunch clean up before we do and pass in a blaze
of glory and dont forget it hereafter-im-
in charge

by this time we were before our pavilion and
neither of us in a very amiable mood im
afraid rador was awaiting us with a score of his
men

  let none pass in here without authority-and
let none pass out unless i accompany them he
ordered brusquely summon one of the swiftest
of the coria and have it wait in readiness he
added as though by afterthought

  but when we had entered and the screens were
drawn together his manner changed all eagerness
he questioned us briefly we told him of the hap-
penings of the feast of laklas diamatic interrup-
tion and of what had followed

  three tal he said musingly three tal the
silent ones have allowed-and yolara agreed he
sank back silent and thoughtful

  ja it was olaf ja i told you the shin-
ing devils mistress was all evil ja now i begin
again that tale i started when he came-he
glanced toward the preoccupied rador and tell
him not what i say should he ask for i trust
none here in troldom save the jomfrau-the
white virgin

  after the oldster was adsprede-olaf once
more used that expressive norwegian word for the
dissolving of songar-i knew that it was a time
for cunning i said to myself if they think i
have no ears to hear they will speak and it may
be i will find a way to save my helma and dr
goodwins friends too ja and they did speak

  the red trolde asked the german how came it
he was a worshipper of thanaroa i could not
resist a swift glance of triumph toward okeefe
and the german rumbled olaf said that all his
people worshipped thanaroa and had fought
against the other nations that denied him

  and then we had come to lugurs palace they
put me in rooms and there came to me men who
rubbed and oiled me and loosened my muscles the
next day i wrestled with a great dwarf they called
valdor he was a mighty man and long we strug-
gled and at last i broke his back and lugur was
pleased so that i sat with him at feast and with
the german too and again not knowing that i
understood them they talked

  the german had gone fast and far they talked
of lugur as emperor of the germans and von hetz-
dorp under him they spoke of the green light
that shook life from the oldster and lugur said
that the secret of it had been the ancient ones
and that the council had not too much of it but
von hetzdorp said that among his race were many
wise men who could make more once they had
studied it

  and the next day i wrestled with a great dwarf
named tahola mightier far than valdor him i
threw after a long long time and his back also i
broke again lugur was pleased and again we
sat at table he and the german and i this time
they spoke of something these trolde have which
opens up a svaele-abysses into which all in its
range drops up into the sky

  what i exclaimed

  i know about them said larry wait

	a tal in muria is the equivalent of thirty hours of earth
surface time-w t g


amazing stories

  lugur had drunk much went on olaf he was
boastful the german pressed him to show this
thing after a while the red one went out and came
back with a little golden box he and the german
went into the garden i followed them there was
a lille hoj-a mound-of stones in that garden on
which grew flowers and trees

  lugur pressed upon the box and a spark no
bigger than a sand grain leaped out and fell beside
the stones lugur pressed again and a blue light
shot from the box and lighted on the spark the
spark that had been no bigger than a grain of sand
grew and grew as the blue struck it and then
there was a sighing a wind blew-and the stones
and the flowers and the trees were not they were
forsvinde-vanished

  then lugur who had been laughing grew
quickly sober for he thrust the german back-far
back and soon down into the garden came tumbling
the stones and the trees but broken and shattered
and falling as though from a great height and
lugur said that of this something they had much
for its making was a secret handed down by their
own forefathers and not by the ancient ones

   they feared to use it he said for a spark thrice
as large as that he had used would have sent all that
garden falling upward and might have opened a
way to the outside before-he said just this-before
we are ready to go out into it

  the german questioned much but lugur sent
for more drink and grew merrier and threatened
him and the german was silent through fear
thereafter i listened when i could and little more
i learned but that little enough ja lugur is hot
for conquest so yolara and so the council they
tire of it here and the silent ones make their minds
not too easy no even though they jeer at them
and this they plan-to rule our world with their
shining devil

  the norseman was silent for a moment then

voice deep trembling-

  troldom is awake helvede crouches at earth
gate whining to be loosed into a world already devil
ridden and we are but three

felt the blood drive out of my heart but
larrys was the fighting face of the okeefes of
a thousand years rador glanced at him arose
stepped through the curtains returned swiftly with
the irishmans uniform

  put it on he said brusquely again fell back
into his silence and whatever okeefe had been
about to say was submerged in his wild and joyful
whoop he ripped from him glittering tunic and
leg swathings

  richard is himself again he shouted and each
garment as he donned it fanned his old devil-may-
care confidence to a higher flame the last scrap of
it on he drew himself up before us

  bow down ye divils he cried bang your
heads on the floor and do homage to larry the first
emperor of great britain autocrat of all ireland
scotland england and wales and adjacent waters
and islands kneel ye scuts kneel

  larry i cried are you going crazy

  not a bit of it he said im that and more if
herr von hetzdorp keeps his promise whoop

bring forth the royal jewels an put a whole new
bunch of golden strings in taras harp an down
with the sassenach forever whoop

  he did a wild jig

  lord how good the old togs feels he grinned
the touch of em has gone to my head but its
straight stuff im telling you about my empire -
he sobered

  not that its not serious enough at that a lot
that olafs told us ive surmised from hints dropped
by yolara but i got the full key to it from the
von himself when he stopped me just before-be-
fore-he reddened-well before i acquired that
brand-new brand of souse

  maybe he had a hint-maybe he just surmised
that i knew a lot more than i did and he thought
yolara and i were going to be loving little turtle
doves also he figured that yolara had a lot more
influence with the unholy fireworks than lugur
also that being a woman she could be more easily
handled all this being so what was the logical
thing for the man to do sure you get me steve
throw down lugur and make an alliance with me
so he calmly offered to ditch the red dwarf if i
would deliver yolara my reward from germany
was to be said emperorship can you beat it
good lord

  he went off into a perfect storm of laughter
but not to me in the light of what germany has done
and has proved herself capable of did this thing
seem at all absurd rather in it i sensed the dawn
of catastrophe colossal

  and yet he was quiet enough now im a bit
scared theyve got the keth ray and those gravity-

destroying bombs-

  gravity-destroying bombs i gasped

  sure he said the little fairy that sent the
trees and stones kiting up from lugurs garden
von hetzdorp licked his lips over them they cut
off gravity just about as the shadow screens cut
off light-and consequently whatevers in their
range just naturally goes shooting up to the moon-
they get my goat why deny it went on larry
with them and the keth and gentle invisible sol-
diers walking around assassinating at will-well
the bolsheviki are only puling babes eh doc

  i dont mind the shining one said okeefe-
one splash of a downtown new york high-pressure
fire hose would do for it but the others-are the
goods believe me

  but for once okeefes confidence found no echo
within me not lightly as he did i hold that dread
mystery the dweller-and a vision passed before
me a vision of an apocalypse undreamed by the
evangelist

  a vision of the shining one swirling into our
world a monstrous glorious flaming pillar of incar-
nate eternal evil-of peoples passing through its
radiant embrace into that hideous unearthly life-in-
death which i had seen enfold the sacrifices-of
armies trembling into dancing atoms of diamond
dust beneath the green rays rhythmic death-of
cities rushing out into space upon the wings of
that other demoniac force which olaf had watched
at work-of a haunted world through which the as-
sassins of the dwellers court stole invisible carry-
ing with them every passion of hell-of the rallying
the moon pool	

to the thing of every sinister soul and of the weak
and the unbalanced mystics and carnivores of hu-
manity alike for well i knew that once loosed not
even germany could hold this devil-god for long and
that swiftly its blight would spread

  and then a world that was all colossal reek of
cruelty and terror a welter of lusts of hatreds and
of torment a chaos of horror in which the dweller
waxing ever stronger the ghastly hordes of those it
had consumed growing ever greater wreaked its in-
human will

   at the last a ruined planet a cosmic plague spin-
ning through the shuddering heavens its verdant
plains its murmuring forests its meadows and its
mountains manned only by a countless crew of soul-
less mindless dead-alive their shells illumined with
the dwellers infernal glory-and flaming over this
vampirized earth like a flare from some hell far
infinitely far beyond the reach of mans farthest
flung imagining-the dweller

rador jumped to his feet walked to the whis-
pering globe he bent over its base did some-
thing with its mechanism beckoned to us the
globe span rapidly faster than ever i had seen it
before a low humming arose changed into a mur-
mur and then from it i heard lugurs voice clearly

  it is to be war then

  there was a chorus of assent-from the council
i thought

  i will take the tall one named-larree it was
the priestesss voice after the three tal you may
have him lugur to do with as you will

  no it was lugurs voice again but with a
rasp of anger all must die

  he shall die again yolara but i would that
first he see lakla pass-and that she know what is
to happen to him 

  no i started-forthis was von hetzdorp
now is no time yolara for ones own desires
this is my council at the end of the three tal
lakla will come for our answer your men will be
in ambush and they will slay her and her escort
quickly with the keth but not till that is done
must the three be slain-and then quickly with
lakla dead we shall go forth to the silent ones-
and i promise you that i will find the way to destroy
them

  it is well it was lugur

  it is well yolara it was a womans voice
and i knew it for that old one of ravaged beauty
cast from your mind whatever is in it for this
stranger-either of love or hatred in this the
council is with lugur and the man of wisdom

  there was a silence then came the priestesss
voice sullen but-beaten

   it is well

  let the three be taken now by rador to the
temple and given to the high priest sator-thus
lugur-until what we have planned comes to
pass

  rador gripped the base of the globe abruptly it
ceased its spinning he turned to us as though to
speak and even as he did so its bell note sounded
peremptorily and on it the color films began to creep
at their accustomed pace

  i hear the green dwarf whispered they shall

be taken there at once the globe grew silent he
stepped toward us

you have heard he turned to us

not on your life rador said larry nothing
doing and then in the murians own tongue we
follow lakla rador and you lead the way he
thrust the pistol close to the green dwarfs side

rador did not move

of what use larree f he said quietly me
you can slay-but in the end you will be taken life
is not held so dear in muria that my men out there
or those others who can come quickly will let you
by-even though you slay many and in the end
they will overpower you

there was a trace of irresolution in okeefes
face

and added rador if i let you go i dance with
the shining one-or worse

okeefes pistol hand dropped

youre a good sport rador and far be it from
me to get you in bad he said take us to the
temple-when we get there-well your responsibil-
ity ends doesnt it

the green dwarf nodded on his face a curious
expression-was it relief or was it emotion
higher than this

he turned curtly

follow he said we passed out of that gay
little pavilion that had come to be home to us even
in this alien place the guards stood at attention

you sattoya stand by the globehe ordered
one of them should the afyo maie ask say that i
am on my way with the strangers even as she has
commanded

we passed through the lines to the corial standing
like a great shell at the end of the runway leading
into the green road

wait you here he said curtly to the driver the
green dwarf ascended to his seat sought the lever
and we swept on-on and out upon the glistening
obsidian

then rador faced us and laughed

larree he cried i love you for that spirit of
yours and did you think that rador would carry
to the temple prison a man who would take the
chances of torment upon his own shoulders to save
him or you goodwin who saved him from the
rotting death for what did i take the corial or
lift the veil of silence that i might hear what threat-
ened you-

he swept the corial to the left away from the
temple approach

i am done with lugur and with yolara and the
shining one cried rador my hand is for you
three and for lakla and those to whom she is hand-
maiden 

the shell leaped forward seemed to fly

chapter xxii

the casting of the shadow

now we were racing down toward that last
span whose ancientness had set it apart
from all the other soaring arches the
shells speed slackened we approached warily

we pass there asked okeefe

the green dwarf nodded pointing to the right


amazing stories

where the bridge ended in a broad platform held
high upon two gigantic piers between which ran
a spur from the glistening road platform and
bridge were swarming with men-at-arms they
crowded the parapets looking down upon us curi-
ously but with no evidence of hostility rador drew
a deep breath of relief

  we dont have to break our way through then
there was disappointment in the irishmans voice

  no use larree smiling rador stopped the
corial just beneath the arch and beside one f the
piers now listen well they have had no warn-
ing hence does yolara still think us on the way to
the temple this is the gateway of the portal-and
the gateway is closed by the shadow once i com-
manded here and i know its laws this must i do-
by craft persuade serku the keeper of the gateway
to lift the shadow or raise it myself and that will
be hard and it may well be that in the struggle
life will be stripped of us all yet is it better to
die fighting than to dance with the shining one
he swept the shell around the pier opened a
wide plaza paved with the volcanic glass but black
as that down which we had sped from the chamber
of the moon pool it shone like a mirrored lakelet
of jet on each side of it arose what at first glance
seemed towering bulwarks of the same ebon ob-
sidian at second revealed themselves as struc-
tures hewn and set in place by men polished faces
pierced by dozens of high narrow windows

  down each faqade a stairway fell broken by
small landings on which a door opened they
dropped to a broad ledge of greyish stone edging
the lip of this midnight pool and upon it also fell
two wide flights from either side of the bridge
platform along all four stairways the guards
were ranged and here and there against the ledge
stood the shells-in a curiously comforting resem-
blance to parked motors in our own world

  the sombre walls bulked high curved and ended
in two obelisked pillars from which like a tremen-
dous curtain stretched a barrier of that tenebrous
gloom which though weightless as shadow itself
i now knew to be as impenetrable as the veil be-
tween life and death in this murk unlike all
others i had seen i sensed movement a quivering
a tremor constant and rhythmic not to be seen
yet caught by some subtle sense as though
it beat a swift pulse of-black light

  the green dwarf turned the corial slowly to the
edge at the right crept cautiously on toward
where not more than a hundred feet from the
barrier a low wide entrance opened in the fort
guarding its threshold stood two guards armed
with broadswords double-handed terminating in a
wide luriette mouthed with murderous fangs these
they raised in salute and through the portal strode
a dwarf huge as rador dressed as he and carrying
only the poniard that was the badge of oflice of
murias captainry

  the green dwarf swept the shell expertly against
the ledge leaped out

  greeting serku he answered i was but
looking for the corial of lakla

  lakla exclaimed serku why the hand-
maiden passed with her akka nigh a va ago
passed the astonishment of the green dwarf

was so real that half was i myself deceived you
let her pass

  certainly i let her pass- but under the green
dwarfs stern gaze the truculence of the guardian
faded why should i not he asked appre-
hensively

  because yolara commanded otherwise an-
swered rador coldly

  there came no command to me little beads
of sweat stood out on serkus forehead

  serku interrupted the green dwarf swiftly
truly is my heart wrung for you this is a matter
of yolara and of lugur and the council yes even
of the shining one and the message was sent-
and the fate mayhap of all muria rested upon your
obedience and the return of lakla with these
strangers to the council now truly is my heart
wrung for there are few i would less like to see
dance with the shining one than you serku he
ended softly

  livid now was the gateways guardian his great
frame shaking

  come with me and speak to yolara he pleaded
there came no message-tell her-

  wait serku there was a thrill as of inspira-
tion in radors voice this corial is of the swift-
est-laklas are of the slowest with lakla scarce
a va ahead we can reach her before she enters the
portal lift you the shadow-we will bring her
back and this will i do for you serku

  doubt tempered serkus panic

  why not go alone rador leaving the strangers
here with me he asked-and i thought not un-
reasonably

  nay then the green dwarf was brusque
lakla will not return until i carry to her these
men as evidence of our good faith come-we will
speak to yolara and she shall judge you- he
started away-but serku caught his arm

  no rador no he whispered again panic-
stricken go you-as you will but bring her
back speed rador he sprang toward the en-
trance i lift the shadow-

  into the green dwarfs poise crept a curious al-
most a listening alertness he leaped to serkus
side

  i go with you i heard some little i can tell
you- they were gone

  fine work muttered larry nominated for
a citizen of ireland when we get out of this one
rador of-	

the shadow trembled-shuddered into nothing-
ness the obelisked outposts that had held it
framed a ribbon of roadway high banked with
verdure vanishing in green distances

  and then from the portal sped a shriek a death
cry it cut through the silence of the ebon pit like
a whimpering arrow before it had died down
the stairways came pouring the guards those
at the threshold raised their swords and peered
within abruptly rador was between them one
dropped his hilt and gripped him-the green
dwarfs poniard flashed and was buried in his
throat down upon radors head swept the second
blade a flame leaped from okeefes hand and
the sword seemed to fling itself from its wielders
the moon pool



grasp-another flash and the soldier crumpled
rador threw himself into the shell darted to the
high seat-and straight between the pillars of the
shadow we flew

  there came a crackling a darkness of vast wings
flinging down upon us the corials flight was
checked as by a giants hand the shell swerved
sickeningly there vas an oddly metallic splinter-
ing it quivered shot ahead dizzily i picked my-
self up and looked behind

  the shadow had fallen-but too late a bare in-
stant too late and shrinking as we fled from it
still it seemed to strain like some fettered afrit
from eblis throbbing with wrath seeking with
every malign power it possessed to break its bonds
and pursue not until long after were we to know
that it had been the dying hand of serku groping
out of oblivion that had cast it after us as a fowler
upon an escaping bird

  snappy work rador it was larry speaking
but they cut the end off your bus all right

  a full quarter of the hindward whorl was gone
sliced off cleanly rador noted it with anxious
eyes

  that is bad he said but not too bad perhaps
all depends upon how closely lugur and his men
can follow us

  he raised a hand to okeefe in salute

  but to you larree i owe my life-not even the
keth could have been as swift to save me as was
that death flame of yours-friend

  the irishman waved an airy hand

  serku-the green dwarf drew from his girdle
the blood-stained poniard-serku i was forced to
slay even as he raised the shadow the globe gave
the alarm lugur follows with twice ten times ten
of his best- he hesitated though we have
escaped the shadow it has taken toll of our swift-
ness may we reach the portal before it closes upon
lakla-but if we do not- he paused again
well-i know a way-but it is not one i am gay
to follow-no

  he snapped open the aperture that held the ball
flaming within the dark crystal peered at it
anxiously i crept to the torn end of the corial
the edges were crumbling disintegrating they
powdered in my fingers like dust mystified still
i crept back where larry sheer happiness pouring
fybm him was whistling softly and polishing up
his automatic his gaze fell upon olafs grim sad
face and softened

  buck up olaf he said weve got a good
fighting chance once we link up with lakla and
her crowd im betting that we get your wife-
never doubt it the baby- he hesitated awk-
wardly the norsemans eyes filled he stretched
a hand to the okeefe

  the yndling-she is of de dode he half whis-
pered of the blessed dead for her i have no fear
and for her vengeance will be given me jai but
my helma-she is of the dead-alive-like those we
saw whirling like leaves in the light of the shining
devil-and i would that she too were of de dode-
and at rest i do not know how to fight the shin-
ing devil-no

  his bitter despair welled up in his voice

  olaf larrys voice was gentle well come

out on top-i know it remember one thing all
this stuff that seems so strange and-and well
sort of supernatural is just a lot of tricks were
not hep to as yet why olaf suppose you took a
fijian when the war was on and set him suddenly
down in london with autos rushing past sirens
blowing archies popping a dozen boche planes
dropping bombs and the searchlights shooting all
over the sky-wouldnt he think he was among
thirty-third degree devils in some exclusive circle
of hell  sure he would and yet everything he
saw would be natural-just as natural as all this
will be once we get the answer to it not that were
fijians of course but the principle is the same

  the norseman considered this nodded gravely

  ja he answered at last and at least we can
fight that is why i have turned to thor of the
battles ja and one have i hope in for mine
helma-the white maiden since i have turned to
the old gods it has been made clear to me that i
shall slay lugur and that the heks the evil witch
yolara shall also die but i would talk with the
white maiden

  all right said larry but just dont be afraid
of what you dont understand theres another
thing-he hesitated nervously-theres another
thing that may startle you a bit when we meet up
with lakla-her-er-frogs

  like the frog-women we saw on the wall
asked olaf

  yes went on larry rapidly its this way-
i figure that the frogs grow rather large where she
lives and theyre a bit different too well laklas
got a lot of em trained carry spears and clubs
and all that junk-just like trained seals or mon-
keys or bears in the circus probably a custom of
the place nothing queer about that olaf why
people have all kinds of pets-armadillos and
snakes and rabbits kangaroos and elephants and
tigers

  remembering how the frog-woman had stuck in
larry s mind from the outset i wondered whether
all this was not more to convince himself than olaf

  why i remember a nice girl in paris who had
four pet pythons- he went on

  but i listened no more for now i was sure of my
surmise

the road had begun to thrust itself through
- high-flung sharply pinnacled masses and
rounded outcroppings of rock on which clung
patches of amber moss

  the trees had utterly vanished and studding the
moss-carpeted plains were only clumps of a willowy
shrub from which hung like grapes clusters of
white waxen blooms the light too had changed
gone were the dancing sparkling atoms and the sil-
ver had faded to a soft almost ashen greyness
ahead of us marched a rampart of coppery cliffs
rising like all these mountainous walls we had seen
into the immensities of haze something long
drifting in my subconsciousness turned to startled
realization the speed of the shell was slackening
the aperture containing the ionizing mechanism
was still open i glanced within the whirling ball
of fire was not dimmed but its coruscations instead
of pouring down through the cylinder swirled and


amazing stories

eddied and shot back as though trying to re-enter
their source rador nodded grimly

  the shadow takes its toll he said

 we topped a rise-larry gripped my am

  look he cried and pointed far far behind
us so far that the road was but a glistening thread
a score of shining points came speeding

  lugur and his men said rador

  cant you step on her asked larry

 step on her repeated the green dwarf
puzzled

  give her more speed push her explained
okeefe

  rador looked about him the coppery ramparts
were close not more than three of our miles dis-
tant in front of us the plain lifted in a long roll-
ing swell and up this the corial essayed to go-
with a terrifying lessening of speed faintly be-
hind us came shoutings and we knew that lugur
drew close nor anywhere was there sign of lakla
nor her frog-men

  now we were half-way to the crest the shell
barely crawled and from beneath it came a faint
hissing it quivered and i knew that its base was
no longer held above the glassy surface but rested
on it

  one last chance exclaimed rador he pressed
upon the control lever and wrenched it from its
socket instantly the sparkling ball expanded
whirling with prodigious rapidity and sending a
cascade of coruscations into the cylinder the shell
rose leaped through the air the dark crystal split
into fragments the fiery ball dulled died-but
upon the impetus of that last thrust we reached
the crest poised there for a moment i caught a
glimpse of the road dropping down the side of an
enormous moss-covered bowl-shaped valley whose
sharply curved sides ended abruptly at the base of
the towering barrier

  then down the steep powerless to guide or to
check the shell we plunged in a meteor rush
straight for the annihilating adamantine breasts of
the cliffs

  now the quick thinking of larrys air training
came to our aid as the rampart reared close he
threw himself upon rador hurled him and him-
self against the side of the flying whorl under
the shock the finely balanced machine swerved
from its course it struck the soft low bank
of the road shot high in air bounded on through
the thick carpeting whirled like a dervish and fell
upon its side shot from it we rolled for yards
but the moss saved broken bones or serious bruise

  quick cried the green dwarf he seized an
arm dragged me to my feet began running to the
cliff base not a hundred feet away beside us raced
okeefe and olaf at our left was the black road
it stopped abruptly-was cut off by a slab of pol-
ished crimson stone a hundred feet high and as
wide set within the coppery face of the barrier
on each side of it stood pillars cut from the living
rock and immense almost as those which held the
rainbow veil of the dweller across its face weaved
unnameable carvings-but i had no time for more
than a glance the green dwarf gripped my arm
again

  quick he cried again the handmaiden has
passed

  at the right of the portal ran a low wall of shat-
tered rock over this we raced like rabbits hid-
den behind it was a narrow path crouching
rador in the lead we sped along it three hundred
four hundred yards we raced-and the path ended
in a cvl de sac to our ears was borne a louder
shouting

  the first of the pursuing shells had swept over
the lip of the great bowl poised for a moment as
we had and then began a cautious descent within
it scanning the slopes i saw lugur

  a little closer and ill get him whispered
larry viciously he raised his pistol

  his hand was caught in a mighty grip rador
eyes blazing stood beside him

  no rasped the green dwarf he heaved a
shoulder against one of the boulders that formed
the pocket it rocked aside revealing a slit

  in ordered he straining against the weight
of the stone okeefe- slipped through olaf at his
back i following with a lightning leap the dwarf
was beside me the huge rock missing him by a
hairbreadth as it swung into place

  we were in cimmerian darkness i felt for my
pocket-flash and recalled with distress that i had
left it behind with my medicine kit when we fled
from the gardens but rador seemed to need no
light

  grip hands he ordered we crept single file
holding to each other like children through the
black at last the green dwarf paused

  await me here he whispered do not move
and for your lives-be silent

  and he was gone

chapter xxiii

dragon worm and moss death

for a small eternity-to me at least-we
waited then as silent as ever the green
dwarf returned it is well he said some
of the strain gone from his voice grip hands
again and follow

  wait a bit rador this was larry does
lugur know this side entrance if he does why
not let olaf and me go back to the opening and
pick them off as they come in we could hold tile
lot-and in the meantime you and goodwin could
go after lakla for help

  lugur knows the secret of the portal-if he
dare use it answered the captain with a curious
indirection and now that they have challenged
the silent ones i think he will dare also he will
find our tracks-and it may be that he knows this
hidden way

  well for gods sake okeefes appalled be-
wilderment was almost ludicrous if he knows
all that and you knew all that why didnt you let
me click him when i had the chance

  larree the green dwarf was oddly humble
it seemed good to me too-at first and then
i heard a command heard it clearly to stop you-
that lugur die not now lest a greater vengeance
fail
the moon pool



  command from whom the irishmans
voice distilled out of the blackness the very essence
of bewilderment

  i thought rador was whispering-i thought
it came from the silent ones

  superstition groaned okeefe in utter exas-
peration always superstition what can you
do against it

  never mind rador his sense of humor came
to his aid its too late now anyway where
do we go from here old dear he laughed

  we tread the path of one i am not fain to meet
answered rador but if meet we must point the
death tubes at the pale shield he bears upon his
throat and send the flame into the flower of cold
fire that is its centre-nor look into his eyes
again larry gasped and i with him

  its getting too deep for me doc he muttered
dejectedly can you make head or tail of it
no i answered shortly enough but rador
fears something and thats his description of it
sure he replied only its a code i dont under-
stand i could feel his grin all right for the
flower of cold fire rador and i wont look into
his eyes he went on cheerfully but hadnt we
better be moving

  come said the soldier again hand in hand
we went blindly on

  okeefe was muttering to himself

  flower of cold fire dont look into his eyes
some joint damned superstition then he
chuckled and carolled softly

   oh mama pin a cold rose on me

    two young frog-men are in love with me

    shut my eyes so i cant see

  sh rador was warning he began whisper-
ing for half a va we go along a way of death

from its peril we pass into another against whose
dangers i can guard you but in part this is in
view of the roadway and it may be that lugur will
see us if so we must fight as best we can if we
pass these two roads safely then is the way to the
crimson sea clear nor need we fear lugur nor
any and there is another thing-that lugur does
not know-when he opens the portal the silent
ones will hear and lakla and the akka will be
swift to greet its opener

  rador i asked how know you all this

  the handmaiden is my own sisters child he
answered quietly

  okeefe drew a long breath

  uncle he remarked casually in english meet
the man whos going to be your nephew

  and thereafter he never addressed the green
dwarf except by the avuncular title which rador
humorously enough apparently conceived to be one
of respectful endearment

  for me a light broke plain now was the reason
for his foreknowledge of laklas appearance at the
feast where larry had so narrowly escaped yo-
laras spells plain the determining factor that had
cast his lot with ours and my confidence despite
his discourse of mysterious perils experienced a
remarkable quickening

  speculation as to the marked differences in pig-
mentation and appearance of niece and uncle was
dissipated by my consciousness that we were now
moving in a dim half-light we were in a fairly
wide tunnel not far ahead the gleam filtered pale
yellow like sunlight sifting through the leaves of
autumn poplars and as we drew closer to its
source i saw that it did indeed pass through a leafy
screen hanging over the passage end this rador
drew aside cautiously beckoned us and we stepped
through

the four-dimensional roller-press



cting on the suggestion of my attorney
i am writing a complete account of all
i know concerning the unparalleled dis-
appearance of william james sidelburg
though his childhood and early edu-
cation have an important bearing on the case it is
hardly necessary foi me to remind anyone who has
kept up with modern periodicals that he was the
son of a well-known professor of psychology and
that his early training was carried on in accordance
with certain revolutionary and original theories
the success of these experiments was attested by
the fact that he entered harvard university at the
age ot eleven and when he was only a boy of thir-
teen delivered before a body of eminent mathemati-
cians a scholarly lecture on the fourth dimension

  my acquaintance with young sidelburg began
about a year after the mathematical lecture which
brought him so much newspaper fame i had just
secured my m e degree from a well-known engi-
neering school and had registered with an employ-
ment agency conducted by the college faculty one
day early in the summer i received from the
agency a notice requesting me to apply in person to
mr sidelburg

   oijeourse i had heard of sidelburg through the
papers and was prepared to meet a young man but
i was genuinely surprised to find that he was not
only young but extremely boyish in appearance and
in dress when he spoke the childish treble of his
voice seemed strangely out of keeping with his
learned vocabulary and well ordered phrases

   he explained briefly that he was planning the con-
struction of some new psychological apparatus and
required the assistance of a man familiar with ma-
chinery-especially one who was a skilled wood-
turner and pattern-maker he had made careful
inquiries into the records
of a large number of
candidates and had se-
lected me because i had
distinguished myself par-
ticularly in electricity
mathematics and pat-
tern-making and also be-
cause i was one of the
younger members of my
dilass the matter of sal-
ary hours and so forth
were easily disposed of
and i went to work for
him the following mon-
day

   his father owned a resi-
dence in brookline mass-
achusetts with grounds covering several acres in
a remote corner of the estate at some distance from
the house stood the building which young sidelburg
used as his private workshop it was remarkably
well-equipped with an electric switchboard giving
a large range of currents both direct and alternate
ing and at high and low voltage there were lathes
and other machines for working in wood and metal
and everything was of the best and latest design

	sidelburg had already prepared a set of blue-
prints and he put me to work turning out some of
the parts i found that his drawings called for

several thousand pieces of maple turned out in the
form -of perfect spheres about six inches in diam-
eter at my suggestion he ordered these spheres
from a firm which made a specialty of vyork of that
sort and this left me free tospend most of my time
on the gear wheels and other metal parts of the
machine

  during all this time i had absolutely no idea of
the purpose or even the general outlines of the
invention my work had been confined to the indi-
vidual parts and all the assembling was done by
sidelburg himself as soon as enough of the parts
were ready he began setting up the device not
inside the laboratory but out-of-doors in an open
space adjoining the shop he explained that for
certain reasons it would work better in the open air
where it would be free from the restricting influence
of the ceiling and the four walls

  to protect it from occasional showers and from
the more frequent prying eyes of inquisitive neigh-
bors he erected a flimsy awning and two screens of
canvas though resembling a tent it could hardly
be called one since it was completely open on the
sides which faced the work-shop and the dwelling-
house it was connected electrically with the lab-
oratory and had four powerful arc lights for use
in case he wished to work at night-which by the
way was very seldom

  judging that he had good reasons for his strict
observance of secrecy concerning the purpose of his
invention i discreetly forbore asking any questions
pertaining to this subject the information when
it finally came was entirely voluntary on his part

  we had been working for about three months and
the machine had at last assumed tangible shape
when he called me from my work one day and asked
me to come and inspect the device

  i suppose you wonder
what its for he sug-
gested

  i admitted that the
mystery of its purpose
had given me some con-
cern

  well i suppose its
time i told you all about
it ill need your help to
operate it and you may
as well begin how to
study the principles un-
derlying the contrivance
im going to call this a
four - dimensional roller-
press as the name im-
plies it is a device for
compressing or expanding the amount of an ob-
jects fourth dimension

  then he gave me a very scholarly and detailed
account of the inception of his idea and the theories
which he had formulated and was now trying to
prove he first showed me a clipping from a maga-
zine article giving a review of a paper by mr a g
blake fellow of the royal astronomical society of
london the theory propounded by mr blake is
that the density of an object maybe regarded as its
extension in a fourth dimension

  i have taken the liberty of quoting a few passages

 t his without doubt is one of the cleverest fourth
 dimensional stories that has ever appeared in print
 if you have often wondered what the fourth dimension
 is and if you have had any trouble comprehending what
 it is all about you positively must read this story be-
 cause it shows in non-technical language just what
 the much-maligned fourth dimension really is the
 editors of this publication believe that there is such a
 thing as the fourth dimension we however have as
 yet not advanced sufficiently to grasp the mathematics or
 the mechanics of it and we can only dimly reason that
 mathematically there must be such a thing this story
 as told so plausibly by our new author makes excellent
 reading for all those interested in the somewhat occult
 topic


amazing stories

directly from the article expressed in mr blakes
own words

  our ideas of the dimensions of a body are largely
derived from the circumstances in which these di-
mensions may undergo variation thus we speak of
a piece of paper as being of two dimensions because
of the greater difficulty of changing its thickness
compared with the difficulty of changing its length
and breadth

  in flatland-a hypothetical region where only
motion confined to two dimensions is possible-
it is quite conceivable-nay it is a necessary as-
sumption if we are to allow the possibility of con-
crete bodies in it-that the bodies should have a
certain thickness in a third dimension which would
be invariable in individual bodies but not necessar-
ily uniform among different bodies thus the sum
total thickness of bodies in flatland would be
fixed and invariable to the inhabitants who would
be incapable of realizing thickness this would result
in the conservation of some physical attribute pe-
culiar to bodies of two-dimensional space

  in seeking evidence of a fourth dimension
we must draw our inference from the conservation
of some physical attribute peculiar to three-dimen-
sional space the most obvious-indeed the only
one-is the conservation of mass

  in our three-dimensional universe every body has
a thickness in a fourth dimension which is variable
in different bodies but invariable in the same body
and that thickness is the bodys density

  though we can not directly change the extent
of a body in its fourth dimension we can do so
indirectly by taking advantage of the principle of
the conservation of mass and compressing the body
in three dimensions this always increases its
density the two-dimensional equivalent to this
is that in two-space it is impossible to alter the
third dimension yet by compressing it in two di-
mensions the third will be increased while the
volume will remain constant

  though rather technical this sounded perfectly
consistent to me but in order to be sure of my com-
plete comprehension young sidelburg elucidated
amplified and illustrated the discussion of the sub-
ject of hyper-space somewhat as follows

  suppose we start with a point and move it a
unit distance say a foot in any definite direction
this is exactly what we do when we draw a line
with the point of a lead pencil the line which re-
sults is an object of one dimension which is length
if however we move our line at right angles to
itself for any distance a plane having two dimen-
sions length and width is generated for instance
if i draw out this curtain which looks like a mere
stick or line a flat surface or plane is formed now
if our plane is moved at right angles to both its
dimensions a three-dimensional solid or cube is pro-
duced we might illustrate this by the opening of
an opera hat or japanese lantern let us continue
the process one step further moving our solid cube
its own length at right angles to each of its three
dimensions then we should have a four-dimen-
tional unit which mathematicians call a hyper-cube
or tesseract as you doubtless know i have worked
out the mathematical formulas of several other reg-
ular four-dimensional objects to these i have given

appropriate names such as polyhedrigons sextaco-
siahedragons and hecatonicosiahedragons

  here is another conception of a four-dimen-
sioned object based on the circle rather than the
cube and on rotation rather than movement at
right angles let us go back to our one-dimensional
line and rotate it about a point midway between
its extremities what is formed clearly a circle
which has extension in two dimensions next we
rotate our circle a plane about one of its diam-
eters a line as an axis and we get a three-dimen-
sional solid it may be a sphere now the question
arises what will happen if we rotate our sphere
about a plane which passes through its center
this would mean rotation through a fourth dimen-
sion and a four-dimensional hyper-sphere would
result can you not easily imagine such a thing

  i confessed that i could not conceive of rotating a
solid object about a plane and through a fourth di-
mension

  of course he continued such an idea is con-
trary to our common-sense notions since we are
constantly hedged about with three dimensional
objects and three-dimensional concepts if we could
actually move in a fourth dimension many strange
things would be possible we could pass ou of a
locked cell without touching door window or wall
we could take out the inside of a watermelon with-
out disturbing the rind a doctor could remove an
appendix without cutting the patients skin

  these things sound like miracles but after all
what are miracles but phenomena which on account
of our ignorance we cannot explain the sub-
marine and the airplane would have been miracles
to our great grandfathers and what are these in-
ventions but the first feebly successful steps in
mans efforts to conquer the third dimension it
wasnt so long ago that man was like the restricted
inhabitants of mr blakes imaginary flatlands-
confined to the two-dimensional surface of the land
or ocean subways elevated railroads mines and
skyscrapers are other examples of mans efforts to
branch out in a  third dimension when our con-
quests of the air and of the submarine and subter-
ranean regions are complete the next step will be
that of wresting from nature the secrets of the
fourth dimension

  evidence of the existence of such a dimension
are abundant in nature take for example the left
and right symmetry of almost any natural object
such as the human body for instance just as the
two halves of a symmetrical two-dimensional ob-
ject such as a leaf will fit if folded over along the
line of the midrib through the third dimension so
the human body if rotated on a plane through a-
fourth dimension would fit part on part

  it is a simple matter to find out how you would
appear if you turned around through the fourth
dimension just look at your image in a mirror
suppose you part your hair on the left side the
image man has his parted on the right side hold
out your right hand as if to shake hands with your
image the looking-glass man extends his left hand
your hands are directly opposite each other instead
of being crossed in front as they would be if you
shook hands with a real person

  now to return to mr blakes theories suppose
the four-dimensional roller-press



i cut a circle out of paper since its thickness is
practically zero we may consider this a two-dimen-
sional object but if i pile several thousand of these
disks of paper one on top of the other a solid with
a definite thickness is formed this cylindrical
rolling-pin which i have in my hand was actually
made that way

  mr blake calls attention to the familiar fact
that compressing an object in three dimensions in-
creases its density this is exactly what would
happen if density were a fourth dimension my
idea is to reverse the process by applying pres-
sure to an object in the direction of its fourth di-
mension its four-dimensional extension will be
diminished and all its other dimensions will be in-
creased in other words the volume would be en-
larged and the density decreased

  let me illustrate with an example from two-
dimensional space i have prepared a quantity of
biscuit dough and you will notice that i have cut
out several objects of varying thicknesses i can
increase the thickness of any of these little squares
by pressing them with my hands around the edges
if i apply pressure from above by means of this
rolling-pin the thickness is greatly lessened but a
corresponding increase in the length and width has
taken place

  here is a two-dimensional man which i cut out
with a form such as our grandmothers used for
making ginger-bread men if i rail him out flat he
still retains the same general form but he has
expanded in his two-dimensional world while his
third dimension has been diminished

  if an ordinary human body were compressed in
the direction of a fourth dimension his volume
would increase and his density decrease this would
greatly lessen the labor of walking would make it
as easy for a person to float on fresh water as on the
waters of the great salt lake and might realize the
dreams of darius green who you remember tried
to fly by means of wings propelled by his own
muscles

  of course in order to produce pressure in a
fourth dimension it is necessary to have a four-
dimensional object this i have succeeded in ac-
complishing with the aid of my mathematical for-
mulas just as i built up a three-dimensional cyl-
inder by piling together a large number of circles
so i have constructed a hyper-cylinder or four-
dimensional roller by joining together a large num-
ber of spheres

   he then called my attention to certain parts of the
mechanism which had interested me particularly
since they were the most distinctive features of the
machine i can think of no better way of describ-
ing one of these four-dimensional rollers than by
comparing it to a cluster of toy balloons a bunch
of grapes or a blackberry of course it was more
regular in shape than either of these objects and
was composed of the six-inch spheres which i have
mentioned before

  thus sidelburg continued just as a solid is
bounded by surfaces so a four-dimensional object
is bounded by solids bear in mind that in group-
ing these spheres together they cannot be placed
side by side one in front of the other or one on top
of the other as any one of these methods of joining

would simply be extending the object in one of its
three dimensions they cannot be arranged next to
each other but must be put through each other or
around each other it doesnt matter much which
way you look at it but perhaps the term around is
easier to comprehend than through

  the rollers were eight in number and were ar-
ranged in the form of an octagon surrounding an
open space about six feet across that is the space
jooked open the youthful inventor explained that
owing to a considerable but invisible extension of
each of the rollers in the fourth dimension the
space was really full except for a very small aper-
ture to admit the object to be compressed

  at his suggestion i tried to thrust my hand
through this space which as far as visible evidence
was concerned was totally vacant much to my
astonishment my hand encountered something pal-
pably hard and solid nor could i force my arm
through the six foot opening

  by an ingenious arrangement of gears operated
by a powerful electric motor the eight rollers could
be made to rotate in unison the amount of open-
ing between them could be adjusted within a frac-
tion of a centimeter by means of a very accurate
micrometer screw turned by a wheel about the size
off the steering wheel of an automobile this wheel
colild either be operated by hand or if any espe-
cially large force were desired could be put in gear
with the electric motor by the simple expedient of
throwing over a handle very much like the controller
of a trolley car

  having thus explained the theoretical and me-
chanical principles underlying his invention sidel-
burg proceeded to test it i could see that he was
very nervous and excited when the final moment ar-
rived which would determine whether he had wasted
an enormous amount of money and labor or had
made a revolutionary discovery

   the first object run through the press was a cyl-
inder of steel about two feet long and three inches
in diameter it was a waste piece sawn from a
longer bar which had formed one of the shafts of
the machine he placed it on the table in front of
the rollers adjusted it so that it came exactly in the
center of the octagon and directed me to throw the
switch with the jerky motion of a mechanism op-
erated for the first time the rollers began to rotate
as he pushed the cylinder forward it seemed to be
caught by invisible claws and sucked slowly into
the open space

  sidelburg darted around to the other side and
breathlessly waited for it to emerge a cry of joy
escaped his trembling lips eureka it works
and he seized the piece of metal and held it out
for me to inspect it had expanded to more than
twice its original size but except for the apparent
decrease in density still preserved the appearance
of steel

  think what this will mean to the construction
of aeroplanes or any other machinery for that
matter sidelburg enthused it will be an easy
matter to make steel which is lighter than alum-
inum

  but will it have the same strength volume for
volume

  probably not that we can easily determine hy


amazing stories

making the usual tests but if my theories are cor-
rect it will be possible to make an enormous de-
crease in the weight with only a slight diminution
in strength now im going to see what will happen
if i press it to the limit

  he started the machine once more and as soon
as the rollers had taken hold on the steel rod he
threw over the controller handle thus starting the
mechanism which pressed the rollers together with
great force the severe strain which this put on
the machine was shown by the ripping grinding
noise which it emitted

  the result was probably anticipated by sidelburg
but to me it was a considerable surprise to see the
solid chunk of metal swell up like an enormous toy
balloon and go sailing away into space carrying
with it the canvas awning which covered our out-
door machine shop

  that illustrates another possibility exulted the
inventor think of a dirigible balloon made of
solid steel no expensive silk covering no danger-
ous explosive gas just a piece of expanded metal
with a propellor and rudder and elevating planes to
direct it in whatever direction you desire now
im going to try the effect on a living being jocko
will have the honor of being the first living subject
to go through the four-dimensional roller-press

  jocko was the name of sidelburgs pet monkey a
very droll creature which he kept chained to one of
the poles of his out-door laboratory i had always
regarded its presence as but one of the many indi-
cations of sidelburgs natural boyishness and the
idea that he was contemplating using it to experi-
ment upon had never entered my mind

  after carefully adjusting the machine the young
inventor picked up the baboon i should judge that
it weighed about fifty pounds and placed it on the
platform in front of the machine he had some
difficulty in forcing the animals head between the
rollers but i have no doubt that it would have
been much harder had not jocko become accustomed
to the appearance and noise of moving machinery

  as we expected jocko appeared on the other side
somewhat augmented in size though the machine
had purposely been adjusted so that only a slight
diminution in the fourth dimension or density would
take place since the monkey seemed in no wise dis-
turbed by the operation and gave no indication that
he had suffered any pain we decided to repeat the
process the wheel of the micrometer was turned
a fraction of a revolution and this was repeated
several times until jocko had assumed the propor-
tions of a good sized man when placed upon the
ground he behaved in a perfectly normal manner
except that his motions were extremely rapid and
when he moved about it was with surprisingly long
leaps and bounds sidelburg explained that this
was due to the removal of some of the inhibiting
effects of gravity

  so	elated was he with the manifest success of his
invention that he forgot to chain jocko again and
the transformed animal was allowed to jump around
at will and enjoy his new freedom

  then nothing would do but that sidelburg must
try the machine on himself in vain i pleaded with
him to await a time when the experiment could be
performed with other witnesses than myself i told

him i did not feel like bearing the responsibility
alone and in answer to this he-hastily wrote and
signed a note absolving me of all blame in case any-
thing went wrong this paper i have filed -with the
police authorities of brookline

   realizing at last that he was determined to experi-
ment on his own body in spite of all my pleadings to
postpone the test i grudgingly consented to assist
him all the details of adjustment however i in-
sisted that he should attend to himself i merely
waited until he had taken his position on the plat-
form and when he gave the word threw in the
switch

  the effect on sidelburg was very much like that
produced on the monkey the first time it went
through the press-namely a slight increase in
bulk i believe i hinted before that he was rather
small in stature his original height was about
five feet and four inches and he couldnt have
weighed much more than a hundred pounds after
passing through the machine however his height
was approximately five feet and eight inches and
one would have estimated his weight to be about a
hundred and fifty pounds this though was de-
ceptive for his weight couldnt have changed

   how do you feel  was my first question

  pine when i was going through i had a kind
of puffy sensation such as you have when you fill
your lungs with a deep breath but thats gone now
and i feel perfectly normal except that it seems
much easier to move to illustrate this he ran
out on the tennis court which was close by pro-
pelling himself with enormous bounds and jumped
over the net he cleared it by fully three feet he
could have easily broken the worlds record for the
high jump

  ive always wanted to be a big man he cried
and now i can be as big as i wish i believe ill
go through once more

  again i begged him to wait but with as little
success as before he gave the micrometer wheel
an almost imperceptible twist and stretched him-
self out on the platform i turned on the current
and the rollers began to revolve so intent was i
on watching sidelburg as his head slowly entered
the jaws of the marvelous machine that i had not
noticed the return of jocko

  my first warning of danger was a harsh grating
gripping sound exactly like that emitted by the
machine the last time the steel rod went through it

i	turned to the switch board and was horrified to
see jocko clinging to the handle of the controller
which-doubtless in imitation of his master-he
had just pulled down

   sidelburgs shoulders and chest were just emerg-
ing from between the rollers they were swollen
to enormous proportion from his mouth escaped
a shrill cry like that of a wounded fowl and words
thin quivering and very far away pierced my ter-
ror-stricken brain turn off the power-for gods
sa-

  i	dashed to the switch-board jocko evidently
mistook my sudden action as directed against him
for he bared his teeth and leaped upon me it was
not difficult to move him from side to side for he
was very light but hisstrength was enormous he
wrapped his long arms and legs around me and
the four-dimensional roller-press



held me powerless but desperation gave me the
strength of a madman and i finally wrenched an
arm free grasped a block of wood and gave the ape
a stunning blow on the head he broke away from
me and with stupendous bounds leaped out of sight

  by this time the rollers had passed over sidel-
burgs torso and thighs and were about even with
his knees his body was bloated to the size of a
large balloon and it seemed almost about to lift the
machine which was already rocking on its founda-
tions

  just as i pulled out the switch which stopped the
motion of the rollers a sudden gust of wind caught
the swollen body and added just enough force to
wrench the press clear of the ground sidelburgs
feet and ankles were clamped firmly between the
rollers and as he slowly rose in the air like an

enormous dirigible he took the machine along with
him

  the next day some fisherman off the coast of
newfoundland reported seeing a zeppelin flying end
up at a height of about a mile as far as i know
that was the last that was seen of william james
sidelburg and his four-dimensional roller-press

  some of my friends to whom i have related this
story have asked me if i could reconstruct sidel-
burgs invention this i feel quite confident that i
could do with the aid of the blue-prints and for-
mulas which he left behind but the mere thought
of making the attempt is horribly repugnant to me

i	have noticed that nature has a way of visiting
dire punishment upon importunate mortals who
seek to pry too deeply into her secrets

editor amazing stories

i have felt the urge to tell you what i think of
amazing stories for a long time but before of
feririg any criticism or suggestions i must say that
amazing stories is filling a place in the needs of
the scientifically minded people of thi good old
earth i have found that most persons afflicted
with a touch of science have becope addicts to
fact

now fact is all right in its place a blessing that
we do need but fact does not concede to imagin-
ation even though imagination will concede to fact
this makes the victim rather cold-blooded with a
tendency to be heartless this last state is against
nature and though man who has fought and won
against nature time and time again has to be
pretty careful because some way or somehow na-
ture crops up again and wins in the end and the
scientist who lacks enough imagination and who
stuffs his anatomy so full of fact that he hasnt
room for anything else-wil soon be passe the
ideal attainment therefore is one of a complete
balance of fact and imagination slave to neither
of the two but master of both and if ever a pub-
lication can he offered to a person as a means of
achieving this balance-it is amazing stories

inoffering my criticism i wish to say mildly
that the story the green splotches really de-
serves no place in this magazine this story treats
on something that is impossible namely plant
men that can talk where do they get their
lungs jvfcy does not the story tell us how or why
the plant mpn picked the certain spot they did
in order to land funny that they would remain
ignorant of the fact that other people existed and
in triuch better specimens we learned no secret
from their methods of communication taor of con-
trolling their great ship and as a whole the
story left us with much of a feeling of disappoint-
ment

 on the other hand such stories as off on a
comet a columbus of space and even the
island of dr moreaitl are all worthy of the high-
est- praise i am speaking of my own personal 
feelings these stories were all very entertaining
and each one seemed unsurpassable until the next
one came out and took the honors away from it
but the best story of all is the land time for-
got and its sequel the people time forgot
iniisistorv one gets a little of the human
iige which is so desirable human feelings hu-
man sufferings of a real physical nature which we
can all understand rather than the mental tor-
tures of some reat brain which we sympathize
with but cannot understand in bringing the
two girls lys and ajor into the plot mr bur-
roughs lends a something to the story that makes
it worth reading we like to read of such things
as a land still infested with dinosaurs petrodactyls
the brontosaurus and those things because they
are real they have lived and we have facts
enough to satisfy the most critical of scientists
however mr burroughs has created a situation

that i am sure our readers are not going to like
if it turns out the way it looks he has ended the
second installment with the americans leaving be-
hind good old billings now that will never do
if the story ends like that then for heavens
sake write a sequel to it that will bring billings
out of it-with tne girl even i could get him out
of it so there is no question but that mr bur-
roughs can

  the letter which we print carries out the gist of
what we have said in reference to another corres-
pondent-that imagination plays a great part in the
development of natural science what our corres-
pondent says about the green splotches is in
the same line of thought with what some others
have written us an old saying is that it is impos-
sible to please everybody but our magazine shows
us that it is equally impossible to displease every-
body because many of our readers have been
greatly delighted with the very story he condemns
mr stribiing is an author of high reputation you
need not have worried about good old billings in
mr burroughs story he comes out all right in
the end as you probably have seen-editor

a voice from far off india

editor amazing stories

  i have been regularly reading the amazing
stories magazine since april last and i have found
that the contents really are amazing to read your
stories one must have a great deal of imagination-
and i do not boast when i say that i have got that
here in far off india i hesitated ere i wrote to
you this letter because i thought that you in new
york would take no heed oftne but as i  con-
tinually read in your magazine that you invite
all your readers to write to you i venture to
write and tell you that i really like this magazine
there are no stories that i have not read up to
now and all of them are reallv excellent your
serials like station x a trip to the centre
of the earth a columbus of space the sec-
ond deluge the purchase of the north pte
the man from the atom beyond the pole
off on a comet the island of dr moreau
etc etc are simply superb while the short stories
are really grand

  we feel that the most complimentary jeply we
can give to this flattering letter from india is to
print it in full we would like to say that we are
doing our best but while we have our best in
mind we realize that there is always room for
improvement and we want to substitute better for
best in a sense so as to feel that we are going
to improve our amazing stories issue after issue
as the months go on such letters as this which
we feel almost pass our deserts are very accept-
able-editor 

telepathy and thought machines
in actual life

editor amazing stories

  i have always been intensely interested in that
class of literature which you so aptly term scien-
tifiction and since amazing stories first ap-
peared i have been an avid and enthusiastic reader
of its engrossing contents

  lately i have noticed that you referred to cer-
tain items in the news that apparently substantiate
two remarkable tales which have appeared in this
magazine the stories were the island of dr
moreau by h g wells and the red dust
by murray leinster but thev are not the only
examples of scientifiction which have proved true
to an exceptional degree  within the last few
weeks i have come across no less than three news-
paper articles based on subjects which as fiction
had already appeared in amazing stories one
which recently was printed in the evening world
was headed insects imperil life of mankind and
it told as fact what h g wells related so vividly
in the empire of the ants then again the
sunday world of january th contained an inter-
esting account of the startling experiments by
means l of which an italian scientist prof caz-
zamalli of the university of milan discovered that
under certain conditions the human brain emits
radiations which may be received by a specially
constructed complex radio set

  what might happen when this device is perfected
has been brilliantly portrayed by samuel m sar-
gent jr in the telepathic pick-up the third
article which has come to my attention is perhaps
the most extraordinary of all it appeared in the
world on january th and related how the dis-
appearance of dr knute houck of washington
may have been due to a mental disturbance caused
by his absorption in a mysterious thought ma-
chine which is supposed to disclose the inner-
most thoughts of any one who has mastered its
use since this machine is a reality having been
patented by its inventor a polish mathematician
the readers of amazing stories can only hope
that it does not affect mankind as does its fictitious
counterpart in ammianus marcellinuss realistic
tale the thought machine

  the editors are very glad to see that our readers
back up the editorial policy of amazing stories
namely that what is scientifiction today will very
likely he fact tomorrow we were fully aware
of all the references which our correspondent was
so good as to cite including the so-called cazzamalli
experiments on the human brain supposed to emit
radiations the editor of this publication is also
the editor of radio news and science and in-
vention and has been trying for a number of
months to get a line on professor cazzamalli but
there seems to be no such individual and no one in
milan seems to know anything about him we
have therefore come to the conclusion that pro-
fessor cazzamalli is very likely a myth-edi-

editor amazing stories

  ever since amazing stories appeared on the
magazine stands i have not missed a single issue
and on the whole i find it the most interesting and
instructive magazine published

  now i have seen in several discussionsthe com-
plaint that some of the stories were too fanciful to
be swallowed no story can be too wild to be
possibly true even sometimes science students get
so close to their subject that they cannot see it
they become too much absorbed in their work and
forget your admonition that he who goes no
farther than fact rarely gets as far as fact

  most criticisms are doubtless intended tobe con-
structive but most show an absurdly infantile
prejudice against certain types of stories now i
have either found something interesting or some-
thing instructive in every story they fulfill all
my demands of literature

  literature in general has two distinct functions
to amuse temporarily and to serve as the record
of human thought the most important part of
the last mentioned function is the stimulation of
creative thought

  i consider it unworthy of amazing stories to
appeal to the passing whims of a distraught reading
public seeking only a new and strange diversion
rather should this new publication aim at the
higher the nobler and more useful ideal of encour-
aging and recording the best thought in its field
you will find that your steady readers are eager
serious people for otherwise they could not and
would not read amazing stories with compre-
hension and sympathy

  so any of your stories that enlarges our mental
vision and heightens our perception of natural
truths has merited its publication few indeed
have failed to do what they promised critics may
howl and anathematize to their hearts content 
find nothing unworthy in amazing stories and
i have read everything from the first

  of course we all have our preferences and
prejudices but we must not lose sight of the fact
that tastes differ what is nonsense to the astrono-
mer may be wonderful to the biologist all cannot
be wholly satisfied but i think you have struck
as happy a medium as anyone could reasonably ex-
pect

  long live amazing stories may they delight
us during many more months

  the writer of this letter to a great extent ex-
presses our ideas in the editing of amazing
stories we will never let it become a sensational
magazine it will always be one which appeals to
the seriously disposed readers to those who want
to get some gooa science out of their reading and
to find this feature combined with the interest at-
taching to fiction it is not too much to say that a
person who never reads fiction and who may be al-
most morbidly self-conscious in that regard is not
on the road to become a good scientist imagina-
tion is a great aid to scientific progress and in-
vestigation and it is interesting to see in our cor-
respondence how many of our readers take an en-
lightened view of the field we are trying to cover
making fiction illustrate scientific fact and lead to
the development of a proper conception of the
world we live in-editor

   green splotches and the
nobel prize
editor amazing stories

  two days ago i saw the amazing stories mag-
azine on sale at the newsstands and as i enjoy
reading stories of that kino i bought it now that
i have finished reading it i must say that i en-
joyed it so much that i would like to know whether
you can supply me with the issues prior to the
march edition i am enclosing a stamped envelope
for jrour reily as i would appreciate your kind-
ness in securing me the previous copies

  you have a form to fill out in the magazine ask-
ing whether the reader enjoyed reading the stones
as this is my first initiation into the amazing
stories group i wish to say that i really liked
every story in the book there was not one single
story that seemed dull to me when i started a
story i could hardly wait till i could leave my
work and continue it they were wonderful and i
hope that you will publish them at least twice a
month

  and now i would like to ask a question in the
story of thegreen splotches was that adventure
really experienced by the men as set forth can
it be possible that men from some other planet have
visited our earth i can hardly believe it but as
the nobel prize was awarded to them it must have
been a true account or was it just a prize for
the best story of that sort i do not understand
i would like to know more about it

  i wish you every success for the magazine and i
am sure al of your readers wish the same i hope
that there will be enough copies of the prior issues
to go around for i suppose there are many people
that have been asking for them awaiting your
reply i am

   -green splotches commended
 editor amazing stories

    sir  think you were correct in your estimate
  of the green splotches as being the best story
  in the march issue i think it is an excellent scien-
  tific conception and its literary execution is thor-
  oughly workmanlike

     have one criticism on the story the writers
  conception of a plant organism having the intelli-
  gence of human beings or a much higher one pro-
  vided a marvelous opportunity for a bit of sensa-
  tion which i think the author neglected an in-
  telligent plant would not necessarily have a form
  resembling that of the human in fact the proba-
  bilities are that the form would be vastly different
  putting these beings into human form is a bit of
  anthropomorphism that is so characteristic of scien-
  tifiction we cant break away from it we merely
  saw at our bonds and sever a thread at a time we
  still put a human form on everything

    building up from the conception of a plant form
  with senses necessary to keeping in touch with the
  environment with manual ability and locomotive
  ability and with the probsaility that the sensory
  end-organs would be all close together the face
  we could build up a very fantastic and still very
  reasonable being plant locomotion would not at
  all be by means of legs most probably by cilia or
  flagella which could be adapted to useon dry land
  or a circular shape adapted to rolling would be
  within bounds of verisimilitude for it is used by
  plants to distribute seeds instead of hands ten-
  drils or tentacle-like fingers would be much more
  probable why a mouth and larynx when the
  critters do not eat nor talk

    and so forth then for one of these forms to
  appear in the skin of the peruvian crook would be
  reasonable for he would have reason to want to
  conceal his odd shape

    still i enjoyed the story and hope you can get
  more like it

  lish as true and discusses them from the standpoint
  of probability-editor

 editor amazing stories

  i have just finished the march issue of amazing
  stories and i must say that each issue becomes
  better than its predecessor of the several stories
  printed in the last one i consider the green
  splotches one of the best scientitiction stories i
  have ever read i have read- practically all of
  vernes longer novels and most of his shorter tales
  in fact i read his twenty thousand leagues un-
  der the sea when i was ortly nine years old since
  then i have read hundreds of the various types of
  scieiitifiction

  but to come back to the green splotches it
  was a most convincing tale at times i actually
  found myself thinking of it as true- there was
  only one discrepancy in the whole story at least it
  was the only one i could find after my second read-
  delongs communication he refers to
  ting only one of each species also
  lex was probably unknown among the
  first because they were plants i be-
   was unintentional upon the part of
  it is a known fact that plant life has
  tl division

              e among the trees we find this sexual
               date fruit tree is one the male
              d female staminate fruit producing
              born on different trees and so we
              le two kinds tdether in order that
              rill result

              g the flowers there is the same division

  sensible people in maine after all this bill will
  give lots of us a good laugh anyhow

  anyway  dont think that we have much chance
  of becoming another tennessee if i did think
  so i would try and find myself a lost world

  i am only a young farmer  years old as you
  will see by my card and  havent the education
  to grasp some of the terms and expressions of
  science but i do my darndest i was helped along
  a whole lot by travel and experience as well as by
  reading every scientific magazine i can get hold of
   answered the call in  when i was 
  years old and i stayed in the u s service for
  more than  years most of the time in the u s
  marines i have more than  miles of sea
  and land travel to ray credit i touched many
  foreign shores and was stationed for a time in
  most all of the islands of the tropics so i have
  had a chance of broadening out some

  many of your stories do not seem so strange to
  me nor absolutely impossible either i spent five
  months on a military mapping and surveying outiit
  in the interior of the republic of panama and i
  have seen many strange things during my tropical
  travels

  this letter maybe will be of no particular interest
  to you but as you requested on my card more in-
  formation about your readers i thought i would
  explain as near as i could about one reader me
  and his opinions

  evolution at present is a theory which is sup-
  ported by many known facts but which utterly
  fails to explain other facts equally well known it
  should be taught as a theory and not as a cold-
  blooded statement of mathematically demonstrated
  proof it originated as far as we know with the
  epicurean school of philosophers over two thousand
  years ago lamarck modified it materially and
  after his days darwin modified it still more and it
  is constantly being changed in its presentations
  had darwinism been taught as an absolute fact and
  proved condition of things  years ago it would
  not have matched with the present views of evolu-
  tionists-editor

          good criticism
 editor amazing stories

    i think on the whole the letter of j p cague
  quite tills the case i do not think it is the picture
  on the outside of the magazine which lends it the
  cheap appearance so much as the paper if
  amazing stories was printed on paper such as
  that on which science and invention is printed
  the effect would be much better my friends have
  from the general appearance of the magazine re-
  monstrated with me for reading it

    i also agree with the rest of mr cagues com-
  ments except that i do not like murray leinster
  i think that a hyatt verrill merlin mjoore taylor
  and the authors of the man iii the room might
  be included among the very readable authors who
  write for your magazine and the detective stories
  that you issue are the thing

   your comment about gullivers travels was
 all right and i agree so far as you go but that
 story could not possibly come true except on some
 other planet ana i must remind you that your
 motto is extravagant fiction today    cold
 fact tomorrow and so this does not come within
 the range of your magazine also and i am sure
 that the readers of amazing stories will agree
 with me  do not like this magazine for its stories
 of man-eating trees and such junk gullivers
 travels was a fairy story to those who like such
 books i recommend the oz books and such

   the letter of e h hardy on the whole meets
 with my approval except those comments on mur-
 ray leinster there are many stories of h rider
 haggard and jules verne which i have been un-
 able to obtain such ones as are out of print would
 almost assuredly not have been read by many of
 the amazing stories fans these i am sure would
 meet with widespread attention wierd stories
 runs a reprint department of stories such as these
 so why shouldnt amazing stories long stories
 novel length are to me much more enjoyable than
 short stories so if you approve this why not run
 more than one serial

    i admire your choice of stories as a rule and am
  only writing this with the hope of giving you more
  good ideas i especially enjoyed the first men
  on the moon and the land that time for-
  got which by the way i had read before

    we do not agree with our correspondent in some
  of his remarks if he regards gullivers travels
  as merelv a fairy story he is missing a great deal
  the somber minded dean of st patricks jonathan
  swift wrote gullivers travels as a bitter sar-
  casm on the way things were done by humanity in

  of it is merely j vehicle for carrying stern and

 action and reaction in a vacuum
 editor amazing stories

  my boy has just brought pie a copy of your
  amazing stories with the question as to why i
  have taught him one thing and you-whose maga-
  zines he reads avidly and with sincere belief-
  state as a fact the distinct opposite

  in your editorial in that magazine yon state that
  a man niajr move himself about in a vacuum by
  violently kicking his feet and you compare that
  to the action of the goddard rocket

  upon reflection i am sure you will desire to
  correct that statement in both aspects  the man
  cannot shift his center of gravity under the cir-
  cumstances stated-though he might by removing
  his coat or a shoe and hurling it from him 
  the action of kicking his feet which are part of a
  closed system has no relation to the action of gases
  in the goddard rocket

  you owe quite a duty to young america mr
  gernsback and i am sure you desire accuracy
  above all things

                        george w graham
                        washington d c

  we want our readers to send us their views on
  this problem action and reaction are equal and
  opposite in the sense that momentum mass velocity
  is the measure of the action and reaction when
  a body reacts from another body each has energy
  imparted to it and energy is measured by  the
  mass velocity therefore when a man kicks
  the action and reaction of the body and legs would
  be equal and opposite but the energies will not
  be equal and opposite because the lighter legs
  and feet will move with much greater velocity than
  the body what do our readers make out of this
