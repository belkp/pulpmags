are you satisfied lo be one of the eight oclock crowd
all your life  are you waiting with hopes that some
day you will do better  have you ever stopped long
enough to think what a slim chance you have of ever doing
better unless you do your part by preparing in the page-davis
school you may think you could do better if you had the
chance without preparing for it- everybody says that and
the business world doesnt believe it but when you come to a
business man and say i can attend to your advertising i believe
from the training i received through the page-davis school that
i am worth more to you in your advertising department than be-
hind the counter or in the shop then that business man will stop
to listen to you he will say to himself thats a bright fellow
there is something in the young man and he will give you a
chance-a chance to do better--a chance to make more money
you have approached him with some common sense but unless
you are prepared to make good no chances come your way

   if you learn to write advertisements with the page-davis
school by correspondence the chances will come to you the
same as the chances came to the hundreds of others who are
to-day making from  to  a week

   if you could be in my office just one day to see the records
of men who have written to us for our prospectus and then en-
rolled and in six months time left the  eight oclock crowds
to hold first-class positions you would not let one hour go by
without beginning the course your success depends upon the
decision you make now your opportunity is here upon you
by some cause you are reading this announcement and what-
ever you attribute it to it will make no difference the facts
remain that you can throw it aside and stay where you are or
you can follow it up by sending for our beautiful prospectus and
in a short time increase your income  per cent to  per cent

x greater demands upon it for men who could fill ad-

help the most ex-

by gforff ii powell


by oeorue h powell

 i he increasing demand for the trained
x ad writer is widespread-from manu-
facturers retailers newspapers and
agencies where modern advertising is fast
becoming an absolute necessity in retaining
old and securing new business

   today the new concern must pay liberally
often prodigally for quick-acting publicity
and the smart business man knows that a
competent expert must be employed instead
of allowing a mere salesman or other subor-

dinate to waste most of the advertising ex-
penditure with foolish copy

  add the further fact that hundreds of old
established houses are constantly being made
to feel the pinch of reduced trade through
wide awake new rivals that employ modern
advertising and as a result are likewise
adopting printers ink and it is plain why
the present generation will not see enough
competent ad men and women to do the
urgent work

in answering this ntlrt rtisnnenl it is hsimbh  you mention tin ainjosy
the argosy-advertising section

the demand for expert powell graduates increases
yearly salaries and incomes  to 

  the only question for the young man or
woman who is attracted to this field of rich
possibilities to decide is this where can
the best most thorough instruction be ob-
tained 

  the old way if one were fortunate
enough to hold a menial position in some
advertisers business was to rely on such
meagre help as the advertising manager
might offer

  the new way-the powell system with
seven years of marvelous success-gives by
the greatest correspondence plan in existence
more practical advertising skill in two
months than the incompetent  practical office
experience  can in six

  another keynote practical ad work must
be prepared in solitude-it cannot be done in
a class

  in a word no advertising expert can give
such instruction on the personal-contact plan
as i can with the powell correspondence
system

  the expert hasnt the necessary books
pamphlets and lesson papers and is obliged
to rely on make-shift points thought up
on the spur of the moment he has no
definite plan and his  student  would of
necessity be obliged to prepare advertising
without previous adequate study of principles
and suitable models

  most of the running talk of the expert as
a substitute for the accurate analysis of the
perfect correspondence system would be for-
gotten while the latter prevents this

  my system is admittedly the most complete
in existence and it is practically the survival
of the fittest

  it is larger than any other advertising
course and covers every department besides
giving a vast amount of extra side help in-
struction never attempted by any other course
an expensive booklet exceeding sixty pages
is supplied for instruction on engravings
booklet making etc in contrast to nine pages
of my nearest competitor hut i have avoided
all padding and foolish matter not properly
belonging in scientific instruction and by

segregating the weekly exhibit and analysis
sheets and personal instruction from that
which should be purely book instruction

i	have made more expert ad men and
women than all instructors combined have
during the past seven years and i alone have
had tlie practically unanimous endorsement of
americas advertising editors and managers

  i shall be glad to send my two free books-
elegant prospectus and net results-to
those wishing larger salaries and business men
wishing more business merely address me

  llie thrilling break that came into lie lile of a peaceful fig planter witli
  an account of the forceful means he afterward took to asseit his rights
  complete in this issue

chapter i

a piea for help

draw a line from the southeastern
spur of die san jacinto range of
mountains straight to the southwest for
twenty-live miles and your pencil will
stop at my fig plantation

  you wont find it  the map - my
plantation  mean nor do  think
you will find even a crookccl little black
streak to designate the tortuous path of
uurro creek which is a small branch
of the carriso

  anyway it is not necessary to he too
particular in locating my plantation be-
cause  am not inviting anybody there to
visii me i doubt if i could even give
them figs to cat

  in the beginning i know about as
much concerning figs as i did about the
growth of cabbages  the planet mars
hut then  knew very little about any-
thing else except rifles and horses and
dogs and when the time came for me
to settle down and make something of
myself  believed the southern part of
california held out good promises for
a return on the money  had to invest-
which wasnt much

  the railroad books all said it was a
lovely country nil along the southern
pacific and the hooks sent out hy land
companies all had beautiful pictures of
great trees in full bearing and well fed
looking planters holding up laden limbs
for inspection

    a

  and  had a liking for outdoor life
despising with my whole soul anything
like a clerkship either counting-house
bank or ribbon-counter brand in fact i
didnt care for any pursuit where you
had to look through n window to see the
beauties of nature and wait for a certain
hour before you could go outside and
get a breath of gods pure air

  hut  am not going into the history
of fig raising merely a word to ex-
plain how i met consuelo

  i read government books on the sub-
ject of best fruits for that region an im-
portation of young cuttings of smyrna
figs had been received hy the depart-
ment of agriculture at washington
which could he hnd for the asking pro-
vided certain obligations in the way of
care and regular reports were not for-
gotten

  so i invested and now when my
story opens this was my outfit

  i had twenty-five acres of young fig-
trees doing fairly well but  had not yet
seen any figs  had however man-
aged to make my little farm of one hun-
dred acres pay in quicker crops and
was pretty well satisfied

  i lived in an adobe house of five
rooms one of these was my bedroom
another was the dining-room a third
was the kitchen another the largest
of all was the general sitting and living
room and the fifth was the bedroom
of sam tamarko and his wife nnmona

  sam tamarko was a half-breed and


the argosy

namona was a good-looking young
moqui woman he hail taken from a
small branch of unit tribe that had set-
tled up near the san jacinto

  i had several dogs a rood horse four
burros and something  called by cour-
tesy a cow

  belter than all to my mind i had
n cracking good rifle and i spent more
time with that rifle and bones my fa-
vorite dog than  did raising fig-trees-
mind  am careful not to say figs

  it was a picturesque ruined old neigh-
borhood and the shooting along the
caitiso wasnt bad but sometimes i
went farther south toward the border
where i occasionally picked off a brown
mexican bear

  and on the day my story really
opens  was out after lear and bones
was with me

  there was a rude wagon trail running
almost north and south and i was jog
ging along this not more than four miles
from my fig plantation when bones
stopped sniffed and then growled

   had never met the mexican bear so
rear my plantation and looked around
curiously without dismounting from my
burro  saw no bear but there sud-
denly burst upon my vision a gallop-
ing mexican pony ridden by a young
woman

  her dark hair was streaming out
straight behind and she was urging her
pony to its utmost speed i could see
that the animal was almost exhausted
and that the girl was running away
from something- i could not tell what

  she saw me and patting the pony on
the neck she galloped up to me

  oh seffor save me llelp me
pleaso she panted using excellent
english

  i saw that she was a very beautiful
girl and from her dress evidently from
the region around vallecita the first
town over the border in lower califor-
nia or mexico

   what is the trouble sciiorila i
asked

  oh take me to a safe place stfior
and  will explain i cannot stop here
thev are after me

 who

  hernandez the man to whom my
father is selling me

 selling you they do not sell their
 daughters in mexico 

  ah-they do it all over the world
 but will you not help me seitorf 

  could see that she was greatly terri-
 fied her brilliant eyes were now filled
 with tears and she looked at me plead-
 ingly

  for the sake of my mother then 
 she cried  my mother is an ameri-
 can seihr

  my place is a few miles from here

 i	said can your horse stand it

  he must stand it

  how far behind are your pur-
 suers  

   dont know  escaped from the
 house while they were talking about it
 but i know they will come  am sure
 they are not far behind me

  and you are sure you do not wish
 to marry this man to whom your father
 would tie you and that your mother
 thinks the same as you do 

  i hale him tenor and my mother
 is in tears

  then come with me ill take a
 chance at it  may get a bullet into
 me for the meddling

 oh if you are afrau savor-i-

  there thatll be about enough
 im not afraid ill keep him away
 from you now even if you want to go
 to him ride with me tins way there
 is no need to kill your horse now we
 dont know where they are

  but they will surely come scuor
 she cried feverishly

 we started at a good lope toward the
 fig plantation

  vou are an american and from the
 east tenor said my new acquaintance
 yes how did you know

  i went to school there i knew the
 accent

  well to get better acquainted i
 went on as our little steeds kept pace
 together my name is john denny i
 am from the east as you said and 
 live almost alone on a farm

 almost alone

  well ive got a man and his wife
 with me

  that in good seftor the wife i
 mean

  she cooks

  i mean for me
by bullet persuasion



   oh i 

   my name is consuelo bonilla she
said  my father owns a ranch near
vallecita he is a mexican of pure
spanish blood my mother is an
american indy

   and this uther chap-the one that
want to marry you whats his posi
tion and nomenclature

  his name do you mean

  yes whats his name

   hernandez-henrico hernandez

   sounds like a blue-blooded don
too well well give seflor hernandez
a run for his money anyway you
really dont want to marry him

  oh many him i would rather die
i dont want to marry any one any-
way not a mexican

   well attend to that

  suddenly it seemed to me that bones
was doing a good deal of sniffing ns he
loped alongside my burro and  sug-
gested that we ride faster

  there was no further conversation
till we turned in through my gate in the
osage hedge

  sam tamarko atid his wife were
standing in the doorway of my adobe
house they looked up amazed when
they flaw the girl with me

   quick i said  sam take the
saddle off this pony and turn him loose
with the burros namonn take the
scitorita and hide her where the devil
himself cant find her she is in dan-
ger quick i 

   had leaped from my burro and
helped the girl to alight although she
seemed well able to do it alone

  the black eyes of namona glistered
for she loved an adventure

   come fehorita she said  i will
hide you

  they disappeared  knew that the
indian girl for she was little more than
a girl knew more about the region than
i did and if anybody could hide miss
bonilla he could

  sam led the pony away and soon re-
turned with the saddle which he shoved
under his own bed

   let em come he said grimly  i
guess  get my gun ready too

  he got his weapon a repeating rifle
like my own and made sure the maga-
linc was filled

 where she come he asked
 mexco

   yes

  iluh kill em all

  and he grinned as lie sighted his gun
at an imaginary foe

chapter ii

an unwelcome visitor

   they come said sam

  we could hear the galloping of horses

  sain and  had remained on guard
for two hours or moro and namona had
not returned  wondered where she
had taken the girl but knew that i could
depend on her loyalty and sagacity

  and now they were coining

  i had expected hernandez and bo-
nilla the father of my refugee and per-
haps a man or two to help but  wa
not prepared for the small cavalcade
that stopped at my osage gateway

  one man rode in through the hedge
he was of medium height and 
judged twice my age although it is dif-
ficult to tell the age of a dark skinned
mexican after a certain number of years
have rolled over him

  he was swarthy and yet not bad look-
ing he was dressed in the gay colors
so well liked by mexican horsemen and
he carried a rifle

  his followers to the number of about
a dozen remained on the highway which
was really little more than a trail

   i bid you good morning xrhr be-
gan the leader  i would ask if you
have seen a young girl ride by here to-
day  

   i have seen several

   dont parley with me  know
there are not many young girls of the
kind i mean around here this is on
the road to vallecita and i have ridden
here many times  see that you and
your man are armed as though waiting
foi some one is it not so i fancy
then that i am the person you would
give a greeting with your gun

   io you want one i asked

  i didnt like the fellows manner

  from his apparent age  supposed
of course  was talking to bonilla the
father of the girl

   you are insolent like all ameri-
g

the argosy

cans he said  know you then that
 am iienrico hernandez powerful in
mexico and you do well not to make me
your enemy

    i am not inviting you here  an-
 swered  if you dont like your recep-
 tion clear out get away take your
 gang and skiddoo that means in the
 elegant language of the east disap-
 pear

    he began to look ugly

   i heard a peculiar sound from sam
 i glanced at him he was glaring at
 the horsemen of hernandez some of
 whom were now riding inside my en-
 closure

    yaquisl muttered sam

   now although  have never seen the
 fact commented on in print there ex-
 isted a long feud and bitterness between
 the ynquis of mexico and the more
 peaceful moquis of arizona and the
 handful of moquis to which nainona
 belonged and to which sam half be-
 longed shared the hatred the tribe felt
 for the warlike thieving uncontrollable
 yaquta

     you will do well to tell the truth
 said hernandez  yours is the first
 american farm this side the border
 the girl ran away from her fathers
 home last night and probably rode all
 night she is doubtless asleep in your
 hut now

    you arc at liberty to come in and
 look i said  but be careful how you
 speak of my house an american re-
 gards his house as his castle be it made
 of adobe or marble

   a slight sneer crossed his face but
 without further talk he dismounted

    perhaps you would require my rifle
before  enter your hospitable abode
he suggested

    no keep your gun i said  i
 gave you permission to search my house
 for the missing girl thats all cut
 up any other shindy and ill shoot you
 like a jack-rabbit

   he started and gave me a keen pen-
 etrating and unfriendly look

    you arc hiding something he said
  if the girl is not here you know where
 she is

     i do not know where she is

   with something like a curse rolling
 in a muttered voice from his throat he

 entered the house  left sam in the
 doorway and accompanied my unwel-
 come guest

 he looked in every room and peered
 in every spot where a girl cpuld be hid-
 den

  where are the women of the
 house   he asked abruptly

  there is only one an indian woman
 who does the cooking

 so where is she

  her tribe is up near the san ja
 cintos i presume she has taken a hors
 and gone to visit them

  so you give her much freedom
 then

  certainly she is not a slave

 i could see that  had him guessing
 his dark face wrinkled as he stood
 after his inspection not knowing what
 to do next

 suddenly there was the sound of gal-
 loping hoofs outside and the dark face
 of one of his yaquis peered in through
 a glassies window

  sfhor master the senoritas
 horse is here 

  ah   exclaimed hernandez  then

 you lied to me

  i have not told a lie and further-
 more  dont allow people like you to
 call me a liar get out of my house or
 ill kick you out 

 he glared at me in a perfect rage

  get out of my house  i command-
 ed  find what you can

  you have hidden her  he cried
 shaking with fury  or you have given
 her a fresh horse and sent her with your
 indian woman to the hills

  get out of my house 

 i saw him fingering his rille nervously
 and brought mine into position

  none of that i said  you are in
 my house nobody wants you here
 and i have ordered you out  am
 within my legal rights if i shoot you
 if you shoot me it will be murder

 bah i know your sherifr

  and so do i

 still while he was speaking so defi-
 antly he was moving toward the door

  i will find her he said as he
 stepped outside  i will search all
 california

  thats nothing to me take your
 indians away from here
by billet

persuasion



  as a matter of fact there was no rea-
son why hr should remain he had con
vinccd himself that the girl was nut in
the house

  everything seemed to point to a de-
parture when as had link would have
it namona came marching in

  hal exclaimed hernandez almost
screaming so your indian woman re-
turned quickly from her people in the
san jacinto hills

   i did not say when she started i
replied

   you lie i she has not been away
she is not dressed for riding

  the handsome black eyes of namona
flashed at him in dancing triumph a
smile of sarcasm wreathed her mouth

  by heaven ill find that girl i 
roared hernandez

  he was outside now standing near
his horse and several of his  aquis had
gathered near him

  sam tamarko stood with his rifle in
his hand glaring ot the mexican indians
for whom he had imbibed a hatred from
one of his parents i didnt know which

  namona still grinning at the enraged
hernandez came out and stood with her
hare arms akimbo when she saw the
yaquis her grin turned to a sneer

   yaquis she said turning to sam

   moqui woman said one of the
mexican indians

  he rode to where she stood and
leaning over grabbed her hy the arm

  there came a curse from sam be-
fore i could stop him he had raised his
rifle anti fired the yaqui fell irum his

horse dead

chapter iii

amur thk hattlic

  for a moment everybody myself in-
cluded stood there as if we were
stunned then hernandez rousing him-
self leaped to his feet

   your man began this lie said  i
am not responsible

  the yaquis were so stupefied by the
sudden act of tamnrko that before they
could shoot he hud seized namona and
whisked her inside the house i could
see that trouble was at hand and hur-
ried inside myself and slammed the door

   youve brought disaster on us
sam  said reproa h fully you
should not have fired

   yaqui he touched my wife

  there was no time for further re-
proaches a dark face loomed up out-
side the window a quick glance a
rifle-shot and it was gone again

  fortunately the bullet did no greater
harm than break a mirror

   am not superstitious about the
breaking of mirrors but certainly that
was the forerunner of bad luck

  sam ran to the window and fired into
a group

  then outside there began the most
demoniac yelling  had ever heard in
my life- the yaquis rode round and
round the house firing in through every
window whether they saw anybody or
not

  and then i heard the voice of her-
nandez trying to stop them

  but u was no use and fearing that
they would kill sam and his wife not
to speak of myself against whom they
probably felt no real hatred i began
firing too this enraged hernandez and
a regular battle legun

   i can shoot said namona and she
brought another rifle

  and she could shoot she stood with
her husband and their rifles cracked
simultaneously

   live up the girl i heard hernan-
dez shout and i will call away my
men

   did not answer whatever happened
now i was detcmincd that i would not
give up the girl to this enraged mexican

  the fighting was furious for so small
a lot of combatants sam was so fran-
tic with rage that he exposed himself
unnecessarily

  ha i heard him crv he is
down

  i knew he meant hernandez the
next minute a bullet came in through a
window and sam fell to the floor

  then a long howl of rage rose from
the yaquis they rushed at the door
the hick of which was not particularly
strong as i was not in a hostile coun-
try and half a dozen of them burst in

  i shot one dead but with loud cries
the others some of whom were evident-
ly wounded snatched namona from the


the argosy

floor and rushing out they leaped on
their horses and were off like the wind

  aghast half stupefied i stood alone
in my battered house and then for
the first time i discovered that  had
been wounded

  it was not a serious wound scarcely
worth mentioning  stooped over sam
and found that he was still breathing
i picked him up and carried him to his
own bod

  there i examined him and found that
a bullet had found its way in between
two ribs on the right side and out again

  i	bathed his wounds and with a strip
torn from a clean sheet which  was
still civilized enough to use  bandaged
him up then i poured some brandy
down iiis throat

  lie opened his eyes

  ii	wheres namona he asked

   the yaquis took her

  curse them curse them he
yelled get me up i will go after
them

   keep still i commanded  you
will start those wounds bleeding again
and then it wont make any difference
to you where namona is

   curse those yaquis they abuse
women i 

   well keep quiet give me a chance
to get my wits together well find na-
moni dont fret about her theyll
probably take her to llonillas ranch no
harm will come to her before we can
get there

  he grumbled something in his weak-
ness and  feared that his violence
would do him harm

   take a drink of this i said hand-
ing him a glass of brandy

  lie had wonderful strength and after
the first lit of unconsciousness his wounds
did not seem to render him helpless lie
took the glas in his own hand and
drained it

 now  went on keep your
senses ive got a lot of work to do
here owing to your confounded hot-
headed ness see if you can keep quiet
while i take care of those we shot

  dogs all logs of yaquis he
muttered

  there was the one i had hit lying
dead on the floor of my general living-
room  dragged his body outside the

one sam had shot first lay where lie fell
and ilernnndez lay some distance away

  in their triumphant abduction of na-
mona the yaquis had gone oil leaving
their employer on the ground perhaps
they thought lie was dead but i found
him breathing

  as may be imagined i felt no grcot
love for the fellow but  reflected that
it had not been hernandez who began
the fighting lie had been ugly enough
and perhaps would have begun shooting
anyway and if he had  would have
been his target

  hut it was not the time for supposing
that something might have happened t
had to deal with what had happened

  i picked hernandez up carried him
into the house and placed him on my
own bed i did for him the same as i
had for sam he was less seriously
wounded but he did not have the
strength sam had

   had a more difficult job getting him
back to consciousness

  you-you take care of me he
murmured wonderingly as lie woke up
and realized what i was doing

   oh yes i said  i am an amer-
ican we dont kill people while they
arc unconscious

  lie turned his face away as uioukii it
was a bitter pill to be under this obliga-
tion to one who had defied and thus far
outwitted him in his search for the girl

  my fig plantation was far away from
any other the sounds of the fighting
could not be heard by any one unless
it chanced that somclody was passing

  i went down to the hedge gateway
and looked in both directions i saw
no one

  of course i knew that i must make
a report of the affair to the authorities
and thought of jim saxe first

  snxc was the sheriff of san diego
county and a friend of mine lie was
a rugged square-jawed honest fellow
who knew nothing but his duty and the
law and if his best friend had broken
the law that friend would obtain no
shelter or assistance from jim saxe

  iiis theory was that no friend of his
icon break the law so when a friend
of his did so the friendship ceased and
saxe became only the sheriff with a duty
to perform
by miift

persuasion



  i was in a quandary i war not sure
whether i had tinned against ilie law
or not

  ihe girl had appealed to me for pro-
tection and i had given it i had not
begun any fighting but when it had be-
gun i judged it to le my privilege to
help defend my home

  anyway i had plenty to do before i
went to we saxo he was at san
diego miles away and  had the two
dead yaquis on my hands whether to
bury them or not  did not know

  but i could not go to san diego on
the coast and leave sam and hernan-
dez lichind wounded

   settled the matter for myself since
there was no one else to settle it for
me and taking my spade i dug a
grave made a rude box for each of the
indians and covered them up

  this took some lime and bones as
usual squatted near mr looking on
wonderingly at my operations it was
the first time he had seen me turn sex-
ton and lie didnt know what it all
meant

   now i said to myself  ill sec
about the girl

  then  stopped and a queer feeling
came over me  did not know what
namona had done with her

chapter iv

a trbeme situation

  iikkk was a dilemma indeed i had
offered a young lady a safe hiding-place
she was there and  did not know
where ii was

  namona had een gone more than two
hours she had had time to go some
distance and return and  tried to think

of the likeliest place in an hours walk
or run where she could have hidden miss
bonilla

   knew that at several spots along
the cnrriso there grew thick clumps of
trees but these little groves did not
seem to me to be the safest hiding-
places in the world there was not one
of them that eould not be looked
through by a man riding around them
on horseback

  it was not a region where mysterious
caves could be found

  if namona had started miss bonilla
off toward the san jacintos with some
mystic word that would give the girl
the benefit of the friendship of the
moquis then she was still on the way
but i did not think namona had done
this

  her triumphant look when she re-
turned indicated that whatever she had
done or attempted was completed and
that she did not fear a search or pur-
suit

   went into the house again to get
my rifle

  what is your name asked her-
nandez

  john denny

   john dcnnv do you think i will
die

   no not if you keep quiet

 what do you mean by that he
asked in alarm as he saw me pick up
my rifle  will you kill me after all

   i have no desire to kill you her-
nandez

 ah you know my name i then
consuelo is here

   i know your name i answered  i
did think that you were the girls father
bonilla until you told me she had run
away from her father then i knew
that you must le hernandez the man
she feared and-

   oh say it it will not be new

    was going to add hated  dont
know just why she hated you and dont
care it none of my business but

i	met the girl on the vallecita trail
and she begged me to help her and
hide her i brought her here any
man would have done the same

   and where is she now  

    dont know

   you dont know after hiding her

   i wasnt the one who hid her i
gave her to namona and told her to
do it and when she returned the fight-
ing began and  forgot to ask where
the girl was hiding

  and you will find her

   im going to try

  will you bring her here if i am
going to die i would be happy to see
her

   i dont know yet what i shall do
with her i certainly shall not bring
her here there is no woman here now


the argosy

and she would not want to comc an
american girl born and raised in the
west would come here and if a man
tried to make love to her shed put a
bullet through him hut miss bonilla
doesnt seem to be that kind anyhow
t cant tell what to do until  find
her

  	is dark eyes followed every move i
made

   i nm leaving you two here together
i said  and what i say now applies
to one as much as to the other i dont
want any monkey business while  am
gone you are not overmuch in love
with each other you and sam and
either one of you on a pinch could get
up hut if  find when  come back
that either of you has hurt the other
ill shoot you both understand

    shall not move answered her-
nandez  i nm sore all over

   i will wait said sam

  i shouldered my rifle whistled to
hones and went out hut i did not
know in which direction to proceed

  i had not noticed which way namona
went when she took miss bonilla away
nor from which point she came when she
returned  believed my best plan was
to start in n small circuit keeping on
enlarging it as  proceeded until i
found my pretty refugee

  there were several deep gullies on
and near my farm in any one of which
the girl might be hiding poor as that
shelter might be

  i started this was new business to
hones had  been going after lear or
rabbits or any other game he would
know from the direction  took and the
region i was beating up just what i was
after and how he should act

  hut this business of going round my
own farm time after time each time
drawing farther away from it had its
puzzling aspect to the dog

  i did think of letting him smell the
stirrups of the saddle and sen- if he
could trace her footsteps but he was
a hunting dog and no bloodhound i
walked on and he trudged at my heels
entirely at a loss as to the purpose of
it nil

  i explored gullies nil the time calling
the seftorita

  i received no answer and finally in

my long unwinding tramp i came to
the ruins of san miguel

  this was the remains of an ancient
spanish monastery it was situated
about a mile from my bouse one wall
was standing all around was debris-
blocks of adobe fallen pillars and
pieces of roof-framcs

  the old wreck had thus far cscapcd
the degrading hands of tourists who
had carried away bit by bit half a
dozen other old ruins of the same kind
nearer to the railroads hut old san
miguel was there a heap of useless rub-
bish to be sure but all there

  there was no cloister standing no
room of any kind only the one bare
wall at the eastern end this would
afford no hiding-place except for a per-
son on one side of it from a person on
the other i walked around it but the
girl was not there

  i was about to start away when i
heard hones sniff he had his nose
stuck up in the air and it was evident
that he was studying something on the
gently moving breeze

  what is it hones i asked is
she here

  then i called her

   senorila miss bonilla i shouted

  no answer came

   senorita it is i the american

   i am here scflor

  i looked around me in absolute be-
wilderment the voice seemed to have
come out of the ground

  whore are you i asked

   under this mound of adobe

  i looked again in vain

   i dont see you there are many
mounds of adobe i called

  sec my hand waving

  and sure enough from a small open-
ing in what seemed to be one of the
ordinary piles of rubbish i saw a small
white hand beckoning

   hurried to her

   how in the world did you get ill
there   i asked as  began to tear
away the blocks

   dont   she called  namona built
me in isnt it fine nobody could find
me here not even you

   hut you want to come out dont
you you cant be very comfortable in
there
by bullet persuasion



   i am not uncomfortable has her-
nandez come  

   yes

   and gone again  

   no lie hasnt gone again he is in
my house wounded we had a battle
and lie was left behind hot down the
yaquis stole namona

   oh i that is terrible

   yes its bad enough  said  but
what bothers me more than namona just
now ir what to do with you dont you
want to comc out  

   no not now i wont trust her-
nandez see i am comfortable na-
mona is strong she scooped out the
place so the mound wouldnt be  high
and then built around me and you can
feed me here

   but thats all out of the question
what will you do nights

   why i am safe enough nights
there are wolves i know but no wolf
can get me here and what else can i
do i cant go home now

   but i said trying to sco the serious
side only of this but realizing that my
beauty had strange ideas you cant
spend all the rest of your life here

   but  can wait till hernandez goes
get rid of him as soon as you can and
then i will come out

   and then what  

   i dont know ill think about that
while im here  shall not return to
my father to be sold like a horse or
sheep

  arc you sure you were being sold
i asked now rather out of patience

   yes the price was a share in a
mine hernandez had discovered

   are you thirsty 

  a little

  i had a small telescope drinking-cup
i always carricd with me and the
monastery had been built near a spring
the spring was still good while the
monastery was in ruins

   brought her a drink and thrust it
in through the opening among the
adobe blocks

   suppose i build a better place for
you i said  or why not let me
take you to some town where you have
friends 

  no no you dont know henrico
hernandez as i do he is almost as

powerful in the southern part of your
california as he is in the northern part
of ours jet him off home and ill
come out

  there was nothing to do but leave
her i knew she was safe enough
human beings rarely passed that way
and the adobe pile that namona had
built was strong enough to resist any of
the animals that might prowl near and
in fact there were few of these

   ill bring you some supper i said
as i started oil

   very well scnor dont make too
much trouble for yourself on my ac-
count i thank you for what you have
done already

chapter v

another unwelcome cuest

  this sort of thing wouldnt do at all
i reflected as i trudged toward my house
a hole in the ground covered by a mound
of old adobe blocks might do very well
as a hiding-place for a young girl for a
few hours in the daytime but it certainly
was no place for her to spend the night

  and hernandez was seriously wound-
ed the nearest doctor that  knew any-
thing about was some fifteen miles away
and i doubted if he would comc out to
my farm for a wounded mexican and a
lrtss seriously wounded half-breed

  and anyway the day was drawing to
a close and if i went for the doctor miss
bonilla would have to remain in that
place all night which i did not propose
to permit

  i knew that if fever set in as it very
well might hernandez would be my guest
longer than miss bonilla would carc to
remain in her queer hiding place

  but what to do

  my nearest neighbor was five miles
away on the cast and he lived alone with
two chinamen manifestly this wasnt
the place for my refugee to go

  beyond him there was a little settle-
ment but from the little i had seen of
the people i did not care to submit a girl
as delicately reared and as refined as my
quondam guest to their coarseness and
perhaps their insults

  the nearest people i could feel any
great amount of confidence in were


the argosy

namonas relatives up near the sn
jacintos that was a long distance for
ht to travel and she had been riding
all night and must need sleep

  what to do i didnt know yet to
leave her in the mound was entirely out
of the question

  the day was almost gone if i hoped
to get her out of that place before dark
 must think of something soon

  and i waft still trying to hit on a plan
when  reached my house

  it was already dusk two horses stood
before the door

  when  entered i saw a tall old mex-
ican sitting by the side of hernandez and
another of a lower order standing near

   ha so you are the fellow who has
helped my daughter and almost killed the
man she is to marry the elderly mex-
ican cried leaping to his feel and
drawing a revolver  i will show you
to meddle with my family affairs

   was appalled now miss bonilla
would have to stay in the old ruin

  steady there i said go a little
slow first it will le polite to introduce
yourself my name is john denny

    i care not what your name i  he bills
tcrcd  and you already know mine i
demand my daughter

   i have not seen your daughter

   liar do you mean to tell me that
she did not meet you on the road and ask
you to give her shelter 

   yes she did that and i brought
her here and told an indian woman-
that mans wife-to hide her she did
hide her then the yaquis stole her and
i have been looking for your daughter
but i have not set eyes on her face since
he looked at me suspiciously

   better put up your revolver i went
on  two can play at that game and
remember you are in my houfte unasked
permit me to ask how you happened to
come here 

   t did not think last night when sefior
hernandez started after my daughter
that the chase would be long  forgot
that she had the fastest horse around
this morning feeling alarmed for all i
started out myself i met some of the
yaquis returning and they gave me an
account of what had taken place

   well did they have the moqui
woman with them 

   yes

   you have sonic influence with the
yaquis  presume although they are a
warlike and ungovernable race

   fortunately circumstances are such
that the yaquis are my friends i hove
ikfriended them in the past and tlx
appreciate it

   very good you know then that
therv is bad blood between them and the
moquis of this country

    have heard it spoken of i have
never seen a demonstration of it

   you would have seen one had you
been here this morning but what i was
going to say is this your daughter is
under the care of the moquis of the san
jacintos and they are influenced by me
juftt as the yaquis arc bv you now we
will understand each other if you ever
expect to see the seaorita alive again not
a hair of namonas head must be
harmed

   good   grunted sam

    do you mean to put a miserable in
diati woman against my daughter as a
hostage demanded bonilla angrily

   you heard what i said and i mean
every word of it

   by heaven you are an impudent
american i 

    told him the same thing said her-
nandez weakly

  it is so you are a very impudent
american continued bonilla  but as
you say the moquis have my daughter
and you control the moquis it will do me
no rood to kill you

   provided you- could do it i added
  enn shoot quick and straight and i
can talk pretty straight too let me tell
you this i dont want you here

  bonilla stored

   you are hospitable sftor

    i didnt want hernandez here had
he skiddooed when i told him there
would have been no shooting

   had he-had he what

   skiddoo in the new universal lan-
guage means to walk rapidly or ride at
full trot now listen  have bad about
all i can stand of you people from over
the border ive been in vallecita and i
have met many nice people there but
you two dont meet with my approval
 well-but hernandez is wounded
he cannot ride a horse
by bullet

persuasion



   i am not particular how he goes i
am even willing to lend you a team and
a wagon or i see that you have two
horses  will give you a double harness
and a polc-wagon i will even give yon
a mattress for him to lie oil and you
can drive him home as nicely as you
please sec

  bonilla put his face quite close to mine
and peered into my eyes

   why are you so anxious to get rid of
seflor hernandez he asked even
so eager as to lone a good harness and
wagon

    said nothing about losing any har-
ness and wagon you arc a rich man and
a mexican gentleman just now you are
cxcitcd and enraged bccause your daugh-
ter has eluded you  was not to blame
for that i am always ready to help
beauty in distress and when she said
you were telling her to a man named hera
nandez and begged me to aid her to
escape of course  did so

   and you say she is with the moquis
now  

   she is under the rare of the moquis
now and  am the controlling influence
with the moquis of the san jacintos

   i am apparently helpless in your
hands he said sitting down again and
putting his revolver away  i am help-
less then you make it a bargain that
if this moqui woman you call namona
is returned safely you will restore my
daughter to me 

   i made no such bargain the return
of your daughter depends cntirciv upon
her own will i did say that if namona
is harmed by your yaquis you will never
co your daughter again alive

  lie looked at me and a gray ashen
color almost drove the swarthiness from
his face

   you arc a desperate man he gasped

   i am  said  now  will get your
wagon

chapter vi

a removal

  it wasnt much of a job to get out the
wagon from the shed and it wasnt much
of a wagon after it was out but it was
all i had and i could ill afford the money
to buy another

  but  was so eager to get rid of her
nandez so that i might relieve the young
lady from her disagreeable situation that
i would have let them take every horse i

had

   took the middles off their two mounts
with the help of the mexican who had
accompanied bonilla and then harnessed
them to the wagon i made a comfort-
able bed in the bottom of the vehicle put
in a couplc of fairly good blankets and
the mexican drove round to the door

   your wagon is ready seflor bonil-
la i said   regret that circumstances
do not permit me to be more hospitable
but this man received his wounds in an
attack on my house and i cannot have
him here my own man is wounded but
so slightly that i can take carc of him
scfior hernandez is perhaps badly
wounded and requires the services of a
surgeon lie will be better off among
his friends you see i am isolated here
and he would not get the proper carc

   you are wonderfully eager however
to have us go i am disposed to think
you have lied

  he lied to me said hernandez
 and he is lying to you

   then my daughter is here

   i have told you all i intend to tell
you about your daughter i retorted
angrily  i shall say no more except
to reiterate what  have said if you
wish to see your daughter alive dont let
any harm come to namona

  he seemed about to become furious
again but he saw that i had him abso-
lutely at a disadvantage

  he did not know where his daughter
was even if as i had made him be-
lieve without deliberately lying-which
however i dont think i would have hesi-
tated to do-she was up in the san
jacintos with the moquis he knew he
could not get her without a command
from me

  and if she was not there but hidden
somewhere nearer he could not hope to
find her that night it was now getting
dark and a search in a region unfamiliar
to him would bo fruitless

  and he knew-or at least his acquie-
cent manner after the first ebullition of
rage was over seemed to indicate that he
knew-his daughter would be safe in my
hands until the return of namona


the argosy

   could not help smiling as  saw the
face of hernandez

  wounded losing nil that he had come
for he lay like a dog compelled to do
whatever  commanded

   now pedro  said to bonillas
man  well lift the srtior to the wagon

  wc carried hernandez out and  placed
him on the bed  had made and -covercd
him with a blanket for the evenings were
cool

   now i said  i will give you a
bottle of whisky do not however give
it to senor hernandez indiscriminately
if he feels faint while on the way it
will brace him up but if he has much
lever do not permit him to have any
wait till you reach a spring and give
him some water and not too much of
that and now good day sctior

  he looked at me in the gloaming with
an expression that was indescribable
suspicion hate malice mingled with
what seemed to be a peculiar desire to
say something friendly he settled it by
saying nothing

  he climbed onto the seat with his man
the latter took the rcin and they drove
off

  i stood in the road till they had en-
tirely gone beyond my view and then i
went into the house

   how do you feel i asked sam

   better since you gave him the bluff
said sam  what a straight face you
kept and your voice didnt tremble
ah he bit hard  

   i told him nothing but the truth
now im going after the girl

   so then well have company to-
night

  well if shell come shes a very
decided young lady and may prefer that
place where namona put her

   where did namona hide her

   under a rubbish heap at the old
mission

  he burst out laughing

  here none of that youll be
bleeding again keep quiet till  come
back 

   whistled for bones and started off
it was quite dark by the time i reached
old san miguel and i had to pick my
way across more than one rubbish heap
to where the girl was buried

  miss bonilla i called

   here tenor 

   all is safe i did not bring your
supper i come for you wc will cat
our bacon and sage-hen like christians

   has hernandez gone then

   yes when i returned to the house
after discovering where you were i found
your father there

   my father was he angry

   i didnt notice any signs of extreme
joy about his manner

   no i suppose not she said  i
dont suppose hernandez will give him
the share in the mine now

   it wasnt your fathers fault that you
ran away

  that makes no difference if you
promise to sell a man a horse and the
horse runs away the man doesnt pay you
just the same does he 

  i laughed truly i had an interest-
ing refugee  was removing the blocks
of adobe while we were talking and some
of them were so heavy i wondered how
namona had managed to lift them

   oh i helped her with some ex-
plained miss bonilla when  spoke of

this

  i soon had her free and she shook her
dress with a laugh

   i suppose im a sight she said
 but we did give them the slip nicely
oh what an escape i was to be mar-
ried to night to night well thank
heaven this is -not my wedding night i
isnt it dark i wish it was moonlight

   why what difference does it
make i asked

   my feet are numb ill stumble

   the road is pretty level well walk
slowly till your blood circulates again

  she was taller than  supposed and we
walked along at a good rate keeping up a
lively conversation

  she did not seem at all embarrassed
yet she was modest and after the first few
minutes out of hrr prison she was rather
shy in her manner

   i wonder w hat some of the girls
would say to this adventure she said
of course it would almost kill a full
mexican or spanish girl but my mother
is american you know and my education
is american

   so is your nerve  said

  she laughed

  she petted hones who made friends
by bullet

ersuasion



with her at oncc i wished it was moon
light too  had had hut little chance
after the first meeting to study her face

  her voicc was soft rich and musical
her laugh was low and sweet to hear

  in this way we reached lie house

   soon had lights and we stood and
looked for a full minute at each other

  she was more beautiful than  had
thought at first and younger

  i put out my hand

   circumstances are strange  said
 you must trust me we will have sup-
per together and then the house is yours
i cannot make sain give up his bed bc-
causc he is wounded i have slept out-
doors often and you will feel safe if i
am on the porch in a hammock

   i fc-l safe with you anywhere she
said  where are the things i can
cook i learned that at your american
school

chapter vii

a quick proposal

  that was the pleasantest hour i ever
spent at my table in the adobe house

  miss bonilla managed the supper i
watched her graceful form as she moved
from kitchen to dining-room and back
again and sam forgetting his injuries
leaned on his elbows and watched with
a grim smile of satisfaction

  there seemed to be something differ-
ent in tile house it was lighter more
homelike and there was an air of do-
mesticity about it that i had never felt
before

  this girl from mexico seemed to
know just what to do and how to do it
there was an easy comradeship about
her combined with a certain reserve re-
sulting in a charm i had never seen in a
woman before

  when the meal was over she shut her
self in the kitchen to  wash up she
said and i went outside to smoke

  the night was calm though it re-
mained dark i slung a hammock across
the porch and slept there evidently
my guest knew how to take care of her-
self for  did not see her again

  in the morning which broke clear and
bright i was out looking after the
burros and my poor lonely cow when

miss bonilla stuck her head through a
window

   dont forget my ponv she said

   i couldnt

   yes you could men do

  i turned to ask for some kind of ex-
planation but she was gone from the
window

  our breakfast was a repetition of our
supper of the evening before and while
miss bonilla was again in the kitchen
 washing up i gave sam what atten-
tion i could

  he was improving and there was now
no need to go for a doctor

  but he was anxious about namona
as was natural

  well get namona  said wait
till bonilla has a chance to get things
moving hell be back and bring na-
mona with him

  i didnt know bonilla

  after i had dressed sams wounds
and taken a look at my fig-trees which
needed no immediate attention i took
my nflo and wandered off with bones to
find some fresh meat for dinner  suc-
ceeded in getting a turkey

  of fruit we had plenty and my vege-
table garden gave us all we wanted of
fresh table stuff

  have you got any flour asked
miss bonilla before i left

  i did have some put away in a
japanned box to keep out insects when
i returned she had some bread and bis
cults

  after dinner i sat on the porch smo-
king my pipe and thinking

  certainly  was in a peculiar posi-
tion miss bonilla would not return to
her home and i did not know what else
to do with her

  she was good company but that sort
of thing while it might do in an emer-
gency could not be kept up

  while i sat there and was on my
second pipe  saw a big gray horse turn
in at the hedge gateway and a big raw-
boned fellow slid off the saddle at the
porch it was sheriff saxe

  what the deuce is all this in-
asked   say denny you are making
a fuss in the world

 what fuss  asked calmly
 come here and smoke

   ill come there and smoke dont


the argosy

 worry but hero ive got a petition
 from senor bonilla who lives ill valle-
 cita mexico to arrest you for abduct-
 ing his daughter consuelo

  well why dont you  

  why dont i what

  arrest me

 hi- took a seat on a bench opposite
 me and filled his pipe he looked nt
 me qucerly

  why dont i arrest you thats a
 nice question i want proof where is
 the girl

  in the house

  your house  

  certainly this house which is mine
 if the deeds are correct

  did you elope with her

  i did not she met me on the trail
 she was running away from her father
 and ft fellow named hernandez to
 whom her father was going to marry
 her for  consideration

 henrico hernandez

  the same

  well i am not surprised that she
 ran away ive known hernandez a good
 many years lies a bad egg but you
 cant keep her here you know

  i cant send her away

  why not  

  she wont go ask her yourself
 she is a young lady of very positive

  opinions

  how old 

  oh about eighteen

  gee whiz get her out here

 at my call the beautiful refugee came
 out on the porch

   miss bonilla i nid  this is sher-
  iff sftxc of sau diego county your
  father has sent him word that i have
  abducted you it is i suppose an in-
  ternational affair that will make trou-
  ble

 how can it make trouble asked
 the girl facing saxe  nobody ran
 away with me i ran away myself do
 you think i can be sold like a piece of
 furniture 

 a grim smile played around the iron
 mouth of saxe

  youve got grit anyhow lie said
  now as a man i admire that grit
 but as sheriff im lkund to see that
 nothing ih done against the law

  law i does the law compel me to

marry a man  hate a man old enough
almost to be my grandfather just be-
cause lie has discovered a mine or claims
he has

   n-no i dont say that but youve
run awny from home you know

   and i wont go back

   but where will you go

   i dont know yet i have no friends
who will want me the only real
friends i have are mr denny and
bones

   but your presence here is likely to
make trouble for mr denny

   then i will leave i will go any
where except home i will not marry
hernandez

  she wild it so there was no mistaking
her meaning she was determined

  i looked at her and i suppose my
admiration showed in my glance

  remember since i had been on the
fig farm i had seen few women and
none at all like this girl i had lived a
lonely life she was like a ray of sun
shine after a long siege of clouds and
storm

   you see said saxe  as i under-
stand it a man cannot harbor a girl
against the wishes of her father be he
mexican or american unless she is his
wife then he can do anything

   oh 

  consuelo glanced at me as she uttered
this exclamation

  i	felt a tingling sensation all over me
why not  asked myself if she was
willing have her for a wife to make my
life in the california wilderness more
cheerful

  it was not offering her much but the
circumstances were so unusual that 
knew something had to le done at once

   you see said saxe wisely  you
fire not of legal age you cant leave
your fathers house and go off by your-
self this way if i am called upon to
return you to your father ive got to
do ll

   do you mean - do you mean you
have come for me 

   that is just what i mean

  she stiffened tears camc into her
eyes she turned to me

  mr denny she said you know
from what i have escaped you know
that i will not go back it would be
by builet persuasion

going buck to degradation  know it
and you know it

   i know it i replied  but  am
helpless in the matter the sheriff says
that if i wns your husband i might pro-
tect you  am not i have boon
thinking however you are young and
it is easily understood that you do not
want to marry hernandez now nil i
can offer you is a home as my wife

  you have known me only a few
hours i have little to offer you except
this home as you see it a strong arm
and a faithful love i confess i never
had much belief in love at first sight
but  have seen you several times in the
past twenty four hours and i love you
will you marry me 

   yes 

  there was a heightened color in her
cheeks and she stepped to my side and
put her hand in mine

   any woman could love you she
said  i will be your wife  could
be happy here

  saxe unwound his great length and
blew a cloud of smoke in the air

   then i cant do anything he said
 only get the ceremony over with as
soon as possible

   it isnt the first time ive been asked
to marry said miss bonilla  but its
the first time i ever said yes

chapter viii

an interrupter ceremony

 there was a broad grin on the
bronzed face of sheriff saxe

 how will you manage it he
asked  there is no priest within
twenty miles

  	there is a justicc of the peace at
dcscanso

  at dcscanso yes so there is
well you want him eh

   turned to consuelo

  miss bonilla  said this means
a great deal to me i am lonesome and
want to marry you but i do not want
to take advantage of the difficult posi-
tion you are in consider well before
we take any further steps

  she flashed me a smile that reassured
me

   i-dont think i will be the best wife

if thats what you want i dont know
everything but so far as considering
is concerned ive done that with a
father like mine and hernandez waiting
for me at home and no one but you to
look to what considering do i need 
if you think youd like to marry me
im ready

  snxe laughed outright

   its the queerest love-making i ever
saw he said  but then to tell the
truth i havent seen much if denny
hadnt offered scitorita i would

   i wouldnt say yes to you

  the corners of his mouth twitched

   i suppose not im not twenty-
four strong as an ox and the owner of
a good farm well ill help the mat-
ter nlong you want brown eh

   yes

   ill stop at dcscanso and tell him
sorry i ennt le here to attend the wed-
ding but now that the seriousness of
the affair has been done away with ive
got more important duties ill tell
brown though

  we had some refreshments and he
mounted bis horse again and rode away

   ilave you really thought about what
you are doing  asked consuelo

   of course i have you have lived
so long with your old fig-trees and your
rifle that you cant understand i love
you

   i hope you will some day but i
doubt if you do now

   i do now-john

  she came to me and stooping kissed
me

  i had no further doubts it was a
short swift courtship it was not a
courtship at all  make no apologies

	am simply telling what occurred on
the fig farm

  dcscanso was fifteen miles away
and justice of the pearc brown was
not the swiftest individual in the world

  however about five oclock that same
afternoon an old mustang that had seen
service on the plains farther east came
limping in through the osage hedge and
the round face of justice brown looked
out from under a brond-brimmed som-
brero

   snxe told me you wanted me in a
hurry he said  ive nearly killed
poor old sancho getting here what is


the argosy

it anyway he said it was a wedding
rut-

   there arc no huts about it i said
 the circumstance arc these

  i then gave him a adi account of how
consuelo came to he in my care

   well he said  saxe gave his own
interpretation of the law and i dont
know hut what it was a pretty good one
its a queer case hut once the girl is
your wife nohody can take her away
from you where is she

  i	called consuelo she blushed when
she saw the justice

   do you know young lady he said
 that you are taking a serious step 

   yes

   do you know that it amounts prac-
tically to an elopement

   yes

   and are you ready and willing to
marry jack denny now knowing there
may he trouble to follow  

   yes

	 well you are a nervy youngster
ill take the chance because i sympa-
thize with you i know something
about hernandez i wouldnt want my
daughter to marry him well get it
over as quickly as possible and then
well eat im half starved

  it was a small wedding-party sam
unable to keep himself out of it came
to the door and sat in a wicker chuir to
be a witness

   stand here under this fig-tree said
the justice indicating a tree  had
planted near the porch  ive read of
a man sitting under his own vine and
fig tree but never heard of a man being
married there however it is appro-
priate now join hands

  consuelo shot me one of those thrilling
glances i had learned so suddenly to
love and then placed her hand in mine

  brown legan the ceremony

   do you john take this woman to
be your wedded wife- and all the rest
of it

  ii	do you consuelo-

  suddenly there was the sound of gal-
loping horses up the trail from valle-
cita came a cavalcade of mexicans and
yaquis led by bonilla himself in
through the osage hedge they came and
brown who knew the man who led
stopped in the middle of his ceremony

  ah i am in time i  roared bonilla

  he fired a revolver at me the bullet
just gracing my car then with a
yaqui horseman on his right side he
swept down upon us

  consuelo gave a cry of fear and start
ed to run into the house but the yaqui
was too quick for her he leaned over

in the saddle she was snatched up
and before either brown or  had recov
crcd enough to stop them the whole cav-
alcade was galloping off toward the
border

  brown coolly took a cigar from his
pocket and lit it

   well he said  i consider that
well done you didnt give her back
you were willing enough to do your
part and after all a father has a
right to his child

  has a right  ciied is she
not my wife

   well-thats a question the cere-
mony was only half performed of
course so far as her intention and yours
went she is your wife but i cant file
any certificate that i married you be-
cause i didnt

  but  regard her as my wife i
said

   you may you may regard her as
your grandmother for all i care i
doubt however if you will find the law
with you

  to say that i was enraged would lie
but poorly to express my emotions had
the girl gone home of her own will i

would not have murmured

  but she had expressed her love for me
she had shown not only a willingness
but a desire to marry me and i had
pictured our happiness in my cozy little
home so much that now when she had
been taken away from me  felt like
killing both bonilla and hernandez

  sam was standing up he had for-
gotten his wound

   now we have each a wife to get
lie said come-we will go into the
place called vallecita and get them

  my blood was boiling brown coolly
went into the house and of course i
had to set food before him

   if you take my advice he said
 you will let this matter drop

   but i wont let it drop i replied
angrily if i am half married to
by bullet

persuasion

consuelo bonilla the other half of the
ceremony will in- performed

  hr shrugged his shoulders

   youll never get her he said
 that rang is dangerous

    i hil get her if i have to shoot my
way to her side do you know brown
that a bullet is a great persuader

    ive heard so he said as he mount-
ed his horse  but  dont want to
hear your plans  might have to stop
them

chapter ix

a wait into mkxico

  as  watched the burly form of the
justice ride out through my usage gate-
way  felt myself swelling with rage

  so far as my own intention intelli-
gent and convincing thought were con-
cerned  was married to consuelo bo-
nilla and a gang of yaquis led by
her father had swooped down upon us
in my own dooryard anil carried her
awny to mexico

  sam tamarko sat and watched me
the color rising in his cheeks

  you told bonilla he said that
the girl would be safe if namona was
safe now they have the girl and na-
mona too

  and by heaven  added well
have them iwth back

  strange though it may appear the
house was lonesome after she had been
taken away we had had only a supper
and a breakfast togctlfcr yet she had
brought such a blithosomsness to the
adobe dwelling that now the placc
seemed dull dark and silent

   got sam fixed up so that he could
stand my absence put a saddle on my
horse and started for san diego 
was tno longer on the road than was
necessary to save my horse and when
 rode into san diego we were both cov-
ered with dust and the horse with foam
as well

  i found saxe without any difficulty

  hallo on your honeymoon he
asked

   honeymoon  i said  theyve
taken her away

    taken the girl  

   taken my wife

    	a

   come he said getting himself un-
 twisted from the easy lounging way in
 which he usually sat and straightening
 up  this sounds like bad business
 whether it is or not you say they have
 taken away your wife do you mean
 the bonilla girl  

   yes consuelo

   now then who are they

   her father and a gang of yaquis

   tell me nil about it

  well you told brown didnt you
  sure thing found him at des-
 causo and told him you wanted him in
 a hurry he said hed go right out
 did he

   yes he came but while we were
 in the middle of tint ceremony bonilla
 and a gang of yaquis arrived and
 snatched consuelo right out of our

 hands

   what did you let him do that for
  nobody had time to think but
 what can i do now thats the ques-
 tion

   what did brown say

   he said that the ceremony wasnt
 completed i could do nothing

   hadnt lie pronounced you man and

 wife

   no he hadnt reached that

   then you cant do anything

   but i must do something i con-
 sider myself married to her

   weil you might consider yourself
 married to the moon but you couldnt
 get the united states army excited
 about it

   but theres sams wife what
 about her  

  oh shes a moqui i wouldnt
 bother much about her

   youre a satisfying cuss im going
 to get my wife

   youd better get a wife first you
 have no legal wife or brown would
 have told you

   flood by jim i said  i came to
 you thinking you could help me since
 you wont ill help myself

   god helps them that help them-
 selves he answered  ill do my best
 ill keep my mouth shut raid the bor-
 der

  on my way back home i grew angrier
 at every step as i recalled the beauti-
 ful face of consuelo as she sat opposite


this argosy

me nt my own table her sprightl incss
her sweet voice her low soft laugh my
rage grew almost unbearable

  it was late at night when  entered
the house nftcr turning my horse loose
in the eurral

  i found sam had company

  this was a tall square-jawed un-
gainly moqui named billy barefoot
he war namonas father

   what this i hear  he asked
yaquis comeand take away namona

   they took away sams wife and
mine i said

  and you do nothing

   yes i intend to do something i
was coming to see you

  you go to san decgo what they
say san deego  

   nothing i cant get any govern-
ment help well have to do it alone
how many good men have you got up in
the san jacintos

   no want too many men wont let
ever the border into mexco

   well well want a half dozen good
men-men that are afraid of nothing

   yes good men not old men
not boys good men let me think
about that

  he studied a moment his wizened old
face working the moquis arc not
stoics like the apaches and comanches

 ha half dozen six i have
six i trust little elk red two legs
bill faraway tom mud run fast jim
and me

  very well now when can you
have the other five ready to start  
hal they are ready now all
need is to tell them

  he darted away in that swift noise-
less fashion that had given him the
name of billy barefoot and leaping
upon his horse was out of sight in a
moment on his way to the san jacintos

  the next morning early my force was
nt my door

it was a picturesque gathering they
were well mounted for this branch of
the moquis was far from poverty-
stricken and they were well armed
billy barefoot led them

   wc ready he announced as i met
them at the door

   ill be ready in a moment

    want to go said sam

   you dont you think weve got
work enough cut out for us without ta-
king along a wounded man this is no
picnic  told him  we may all be
wounded ourselves before the game is
played out

   you bring namona 

   well bring namona billy bare-
foot wouldnt go if it wasnt for na-
mona and weve got to pass the bor-
der ranger somehow and give him n
talc hell swallow you stay here and
keep quiet have a good feed ready
when wc come back

   when you think you come back

   ha  exclaimed billy barefoot
 when we think 

  we loft sam standing in the doorway
as we rode off billy barefoot and i
riding side by side and leading the little
cavalcade

   knew very well that this was a des-
perate mission i was on i was not
only invading another country under
arms but i was going deliberately into
a region where bonilla and hernandez
were powerful and where  could not
expect to find n single friend unless it
was the mother of consuelo whom 
had never seen

  there is from yuma to the coast a
government ofikcr called a border
ranger who patrols the line between
mexico and the state of califorma
others patrol other sections along the
entire mexican boundary

  i knew that the yaquis both times they
had visited me had somehow eluded this
man which was not very difficult after
all considering the extent of his post

  wc crossed the line without any dif-
ficulty and rode in upon mexican soil

  now billy barefoot i said  wc
carry our lives in our hands

  so where is this bonilla wc
see about our lives

chapter x

conslelos mother

  tii k road to vallecita was far from
good for a portion of the way it led
through open country and then again
there would be thick chaparrals of stunt-
ed evergreen or large forests of small
redwood or oak
by bullet

persuasion



  there were lulls on the left the foot-
hill of the sierra de los cucaras-

  the few people we passed gazed at
u with some curiosity but the sight of
armed men even indiuus riding to-
gether was not an unusual one in
lower california

  nevertheless i did not consider it
wise to take my little band of moquis
into vallecita without knowing some-
thing about the situation there

  i had been to vnllecita and knew the

way so did old billy barefoot

  i found a deep gully with a running
stream at the bottom into which we
could ride from the beginning of the
descent  sent the moquis down into
this where they would ik- screened by
the outreaching trees which lined the
sides and i rode on alone to vallecita

  it was not a difficult job to learn
where the hacienda of sefior bonilla
was locatcd and having been well di-
rected i rode out of vallecita to the
eastward

   i found the place lefore nightfall

  it was a large while house sutround-
ed by well-tilled fields and cattle ranges

  i rode to the door where a swarthy
mexican met me

   what does the xeiior wish   he
asked  could speak and understand
the language as could almost everybody
who lived near the border

    i desire to sec sefior bonilla i re-
plied

   senor bonilla is not at home

  then perhaps the srnoraf 

  ah yes the seiiora is at home
what name shall  trll the seiloraf 

   tell her that senor denny would
like to speak to her

  he disappeared inside the mansion
and soon was at the door again

   the stfora will be pleased to see
the sefior i will have the setters horse
cared for the woman will guide the
sefior to the miiora

  i looked for the woman she was an
old mexican dame wrinkled leathery
but with eyes that were as keen as they
were black

  the sefior will follow me she said

  she let me to a large and luxuriously
furnished drawing-room

   i am pleased to meet you sefior
my daughter has told me all

  the woman who greeted me was tall
anti handsome she was gowned in
american style and held out her hand

cordially

   then i am talking to senora bo-
nilla

   mrs bonilla would ik- more ameri-
can wouldnt it

   i suppose it would i said with a
laugh  now mrs bonilla did your
daughter tell you that she was my
wife -

   she told me that a ceremony was
lie gun and not finished

   but did she tell you that it was her
own desire as well as mine that the cere-
mony should be performed

   yes and it remains her desire now

   is she here 

  no i knew you would come and
 knew and know now that there will
be trouble hernandez and my hus-
band know you would come hernan-
dez says that you are a devil in a fight

   then if she is not here where is
she have they scut her away

   they have not sent her away they
have taken her hernandez was not as
weak as he pretended he wished to
make you believe that he was helpless
and while you were at work he intended
to find consuelo but you outwitted
him by compelling him to come back
with my husband he is wounded of
roursc but he is not so weak as you
thought now if you will have some
refreshments i will explain just what
the situation is

  she called the mexican woman

   bring some wine some cakes and
some sandwiches she said

   the situation she went on as she
resumed the easy position in her large
wicker chair is this my husband
while occupying a position of some prom-
inence and importance in this part of
mexico is not rich he owes considera-
ble money and although his creditors are
not pressing him lie feels uneasy about
his debts

   hernandez on the other hand is
wealthy hut has practically no high posi-
tion at all his manner of life is not
such as to make him a good magistrate
and therefore he is nothing more than
a rich mexican idler

   he has been for a long time a


the argosy

friend of my husband and i fear has
loaned him money anyway when con-
suclo came back from the united states
where she had been at school hernandez
fell in love with her or at least pretend-
ed to and wanted to marry her of
course consuelo is a beautiful girl you
saw that yourself and  would be a
strange mother if i did not know it and
if i were not proud of the fact

     resisted to be frank  do not
like hernandez any more than consuelo
does he is arrogant cruel and has

many vices i know that after the first

romance has worn off my girl will not be
happy with him i prefer her to marry
a good honorable young american and
she almost succecdcd

    hernandez is a wandering sort of
man even though he is rich and his
wanderings instead of taking him to eu-
rope for educational travel lead him
among the sierras in search of adventure
in some way he has won the friendship
of the yaquis the worst type of indian
there is in mexico on one of his trips
to the sierras he discovered or the ya-
quis disclosed to him a mine a ruby
mine he calls it and he has really shown
us some wonderful rubies he claimed
were taken from this mine

    for a time i succeeded in holding
my husband with me in opposition to
hernandez as a suitor for the hand of
consuelo but hernandez knew my hus-

	bands debts and offered him a share in
the ruby mine if kb would compel con-
suclo to become his wife

    my husbands necessity was such that
he yielded and from being an opponent
he swung round to become an ardent ad-
vocate of hernandez

    as you know my position as the wife
of a mexican gentleman is not the same
as though i were the wife of an ameri-
can  could do little to help the poor
girl although she cried herself sick

    on the night she ran away my hus-
band and hernandez were talking over
their plans although he is now in favor
of having consuelo marry hernandez
he does not place implicit confidence in
him he rather doubted his large talk
concerning the ruby mine but hernan-
dez had convinced him so far that he
agreed that the following night con-
suelo should be his bride

   i knew that consuelo was going
away in fact i assisted her it was
wrong perhaps but what could i do
 am practically a prisoner myself and
i did not wish my daughter to suffer as
 have seen others suffer at the hands of
a wealthy mexican

   so she went away you know bet-
ter than i do what took place over the
border but when she was brought back
by her father hernandez was delighted
and grew suddenly better he wanted to
be married at once but my husband had
grown suspicious concerning the mine

   hernandez insisted on being mar-
ried and my husband insisted on seeing
the mine first hernandez would not
go up into the sierras and leave con-
suelo here because he said you would
come for her and unless they were here
you would take her away

   so they have gone to the mine some-
where in the sierras and they have ta-
ken consuelo with them and they took
namona along as her servant

   the trip is perfectly safe for them
for as  say hernandez has great power
over the yaquis and there are no other
indians in the sierras but it will not
be safe for you

   how long do you think they will be
gone i asked

   i dont know if hernandez proved
that the ruby mine is there he will proba-
bly demand consuelo at once

  and if the ruby mine is not there
 i shudder to think then what might
happen hernandez is a desperate man
and the yaquis will do his bidding it
is not impossible that a quarrel will en-
sue and when mexicans quarrel-

  i knew what she meant

   i have some moquis with me mrs
bonilla i said  and i am going to find
consuelo the ceremony that was be-
gun will le finished or bullets have lost
the force of their argument

   i like you she said  and i hope
that you will rescue consuelo from a
man i hate

chapter xi

an attack

  it did not take me long to kjoin billy
barefoot and his moquis and the old
by bullet

persuasion



indian met me with eyes that were inter-
rogation point

   well he said you did learn

   i learned i answered  that weve
pot considerable more of a proposition
than  had any idea of they have
gone

   cone yes they were gone any-
way

   yes they were gone from my placc
in san diego county i explained
 hut now they have gone from bonillas
home

   namona

   yes namona was taken along as the
servant of mins bonilla

  m miss bonilla

  the tone the accent the facial expres-
sion of the old fellow as he said this
cannot be described i knew what he
meant

  well i said mrs denny if you
like that better

  yes i like letter how vol like
yes

   we wont go into that now this
mine is somewhere in the sierra de los
cucaras the whora says that hernan-
dez has really discovered rubies there
but she does not know where

   i do

  i looked at the old man in amaze-
ment

   do you mean to tell me  asked
 that you know where a ruby mine is
located among the stronghold of the
yaquis 

   no mine lie grunted  the yaquis
had the rubies before hernandez saw the
place they do not mine them they
pick them up

   then hernandez is simply usin his
supposed knowledge to enfoivc his agree-
ment with bonilla to marry bonillas
daughter 

   not bonillas daughter now your
wife

   well both i said

   come wc waste time talking lit-
tle elk he wails too long  he grow sulky
run fast jim he never waits so long
wc go

  and go we did without further parley
when billy barefoot gave an order it
was obeyed with an alacrity that showed
how the five moquis he bad with him felt
about hurrying on with the expedition

it did not seem to matter that seven f us
had the entire tribe of yaquis of the
sierras against u

  from the gorge in which they had
camped while  was on my visit to mrs
bonilla we deployed into a trail that had
been well used for many years on this
we made good time

  now it was billy barefoot that led the
way on a small mustang colored like a
craxy-quilt he went soberly and even
sullenly in advance of his small com-
pany saying nothing

  the trail led through a country almost
unpopulated save for small farms that
were far apart or great expan-es of
grazing land that did belong to some-
body but were not under any sort of pro-
tection so far as i could see

  after a ride of an hour or more the
road grew wilder and we began an
ascent into the nearest hills the outposts
of the sierras

  here billy barefoot grew even more
sullen but his little black eyes were con-
stantly watching on either side of the
trail for an ambush

  suddenly he halted

   some way beyond he said  is a
big town of yaquis not like the moqui
settlement in the san jacinto but big
and only huts but we do not fear these
yaquis

  he waved his hands at tlve moquis be-
hind him and they grinned an approval
of his words

  i was puzzled whether the hatred
that the moquis felt for the yaquis had
made them so eager to fight that they
knew no fear or there was some real
reason why these yaqui were not to be
feared i did not know

  wc continued to ascend and the way
continued to grow rougher

   do not know how lung we kept on in
that way nobody saying much lor the
moquis though eloquent enough when
there is something really to say were evi-
dently deep in thought concerning the ex-
pedition but suddenly old billy bare-
foot halted his horse again

  we were on a little pinnacle not near-
ly so high an the mountains beyond but
high enough to enable us to have a view
of the surrounding country and the old
indian stretched out his arm in a melo-
dramatic way


the argosv

  see he asked squinting along his
arm and extended forefinger them
yaquis

   did not need to look but once to be
convinced my heart sank

  huts indeed they lived in but if there
were as many yaquis as  saw huts 
could imagine our own little band being
wiped out of existence in less time than
it would take to empty the rifles we
carried

  hut hilly barefoot was not the kind to
be wiped out

   you he said to me his face as
solemn and inscrutable as an owls  stay
with horses cant fight yaquis all at
once you wait you watch

  he spoke in a low tone and a jargon
i did not understand to the other mo-
quis and they dismounted the small
horses were placed in a row a long lariat
running between two trees being used to
hold them in a straight line it was
billy barefoots way of doing thing

   you stay and watch lie said

  and then followed some more of the
low muttered instructions that  was not
supposed to know anything about and
didnt

  i looked with curiosity and wonder at
these live men taken from their clioscn
home in the san jacintos as they obeyed
the old chief

  billy barefoot himself strutted away
with his rifle slung across his shoulder
much the same as though lie was going
after jack rabbits then little elk dis-
appeared in a totally different direction
losing himself from my sight in a clump
of trees

  then with a grin and a grunt red
two legs went off on an entirely differ-
ent route almost following him but
taking a direction somewhat more east-
erly bill faraway glided noiselessly out
of our little camp and so tom mud
and run fast jim went away and i was
left with the seven horses

  that billy barefoot was pursuing some
form of indian warfare of which i was
ignorant  knew of course but it was
amazing that six men of a peaceful tribe
should venture to attack a town filled
with the fierce yaquis

  alone  sat and smoked billy bare-
foot had told me to wait and watch 
could wait but there was little for me to

watch unless i felt like exposing myself
to the yaquis

   peered through the bushes that
screened me and they all seemed to be
going about their usual vocations un-
mindful of the presence of an enemy
and to me that enemy seemed wofully
inadequate to the work before them

   thought of consuelo wondering
where her father had taken her

  suddenly there was a rifle-shot it
was so sharp so unexpected that i did
not know from which direction it came
but the effect on the yaqui village was
wonderful

  i saw nobody fall but men stood still
in the lanes between the huts and women
rushed from the huts with children in
their arms

  and then there came another shot i
saw nobody fall but the yaquis gathered
into groups and  could see that they
were excited

  and then another shot from a different
direction

  whatever the game billy barefoot was
playing it seemed to be played well

  this continuance of single shots from
every point of the compass seemed to
paralyze the yaquis they were ambush
fighters themselves and had held the
mexican army in contempt for many
years and now they were getting a
dose of the medicine they thought they
owned and it was disconcerting

  i saw one fellow looking no more like
a chief than billy barefoot run into a
hut and emerge with a gun this seemed
to be a signal for the others although
there was probably some spoken com-
mand

  it seemed as though every man and
boy in the place dived into a hut and
came out with n gun

  they drew together in an excited
group and then the single firing began
again alter each shot which seemed to
hit nobody but which certainly alarmed
the yaquis they would look toward the
direction whence it came

  this made them turn around so that
in the space of three or four minutes
they had turned to all points of the
compass

  the leader who had been waving his
gun in the air suddenly started on a run
and then to my complete demoraliza-
by bullet

persuasion



tion so far as calmness anil peace of
mind were concerned the entire crowd
started in my direction

chapter xii

a riuk for like

   had read and heard u good deal of
the fierceness of the yaquis and the
long period of fifht iit between them
and the soldiers of mexico but i knew
nothing of their methods or habits

  i could see them and there was no
reason why they should not be able to
sec me  was on the very summit of
tle hill and the scanty growth of tim-
ber did not serve to shield me

  then  suddenly awoke to the fact
that i was in imminent and deadly peril
whatever the plans of billy barefoot
had been in trvitig to surround a town
of huts with six men  did not know
and at that moment i did not particu-
larly care the thing was to save my
own life if  could

  the shouts of the yaquis could be
heard plainly  made a leap from
stupid inactivity to what i think was the
liveliest time of my existence before or
since

  springing toward the line of horses
i cut my own away and grabbing my
rifle i jumped into the saddle

  that horse though not a very aston-
ishing animal in the matter of intel-
ligence must have felt some surprise
when  began to urge him to a sudden
and furious speed

   turned down the other side of the
hill and spurred away on the poor
beasts flanks as though  had gone
suddenly insane

  i am neither the bravest man in the
world nor the greatest coward i sup-
pose that i sun about the same as the
average man in time of danger

  but to sit waiting for something that
i expected billy barefoot to do in my
own interest and then suddenly see a
mob of howling and murderous indians
come pell-mell in my direction was a
little too much for my nerve

  it would have been surely an act of
insanity for me to make any attempt to
fight whatever immediate effect the
few shots  might be able to fire might

have the inevitable result would be to
infuriate the indians all the more

  i glanced behind me when i had put
a fairly safe distance between me and
the top of the hill and saw something
that did not cause me to let up on the
horse

  those precious yaquis hsul gained the
lop and now six of them mounted on
the horses  had left were racing down
the hill after me

  the beginning of my mad ride for life
was easy enough  but as  drew nearer
the foot of the hill the road was noth-
ing but a rough path made by hunters
and the country became rough and
rocky

  then to make matters worse  had
not the slightest idea where  was going
 knew the danger that was behind me
and not very far behind either and
there was every likelihood that i was
getting nearer to dangers that lay ahead

  i cursed billy barefoot roundly

  my horse kejrt stumbling and i was
in constant terror lest he fall and break
his neck and my own

  the surface of the land after i left
the hill was all cut up great chasms
yawned on the right and to leave the
crazy road that went along the edge was
simply to go galloping over boulder and
logs to certain destruction

  even the road itself was unsafe and
when  glanced down into that ravine
i shuddered but i had to go on and
take my chances lor the six yelling
yaquis seemed to be gaining

  i dared not take time to stop the
horse and take a shot at my pursuers

  my rifle was slung over my shoulder
and was just then more of a nuisance
than anything else

  i looked ill vain for shelter if there
had been some sort of hut or an old
ruin like those of san miguel i might
have made a stand but this miserable
country had nothing

  and then the inevitable happened

  my horse had slipped so often that
he was much more exhausted than a
run three times as far on a good road
would make him and he now stepped on
a sione that rolled he plunged to the
ground and without knowing whether
he was dead or hurt i went sailing over
his head and down into the ravine
goo

the argosy

  if the thing had to happen the spot
was a fortunate chance here there
were trees not only at the bottom but
growing out of what soil there was on
tie sides

  these broke my fall but the crashing
through branches was not pleasant and
i am not sure whether that or the land-
ing on the bottom caused my conscious-
ness to leave me

  when i woke again to the pleasures
of life in the yaqui country i was lying
half in a stream of water that flowed at
the bottom of the ravine sometimes in a
torrent and sometimcs in broader and
more sluggish fashion

  i came slowly to a realization of what
had occurrcd and remember that i was
much surprised when i found myself
able to sit up

  then i felt to see if any bones were
broken my joy was great when  dis-
covered none although  didnt possess
one that didnt feel sore

  my face and hand were terribly
scratched but otherwise except for a
great shaking up i was uninjured and
my rifle fortunately had not been bro-
ken and lay near me

  but where were the yaquis i knew
enough of all indian nature to be sure
they would not abandon the pursuit and
go quietly home they would probably
want me even if it was only my dead
body to carry back to their village in
triumph

  there was no tracc of them however
of course i knew they would not at-
tempt to ride down the steep side ol the
ravine but there must be i knew some
way for them to get down on foot

   picked up my rifle and began to
think of what was best for me to do
there were hiding-places now but i was
not so sure  wanted to hide it was
a splendid spot for cave bears and a
cave would be the only hiding-placc

  i did not know how far the ravine
extended in either direction it had i
knew a winding crookcd course and
the flow of the stream was back appar-
ently toward the hill i had left i knew
that it didnt run up the hill and
thought probably the gorge made a wide
turn

   had no great admiration for that
part of the country but i remembered

that billy barefoot had said the rubies
were found on the shore of a lake and
this stream very likely ran into that
lake

  it was only a chance guess but it was
to the lake  wanted to go

  i knew that hernandez and bonilla
were there with consuelo and namona
and that it would be near the lake
where i would be most likely to meet
with billy barefoot and his men

  i had not gone very far along the
stream when i heard voices i stopped
and sank down behind a big rock

  men were coming talking a jargon
that was unintelligible to me and they
were evidently much excited

  and at last i saw them there were
five of them now apparently they had
done the same as my moquis-left one
to mind the horses while the others con-
tinued the pursuit on foot

  and they were going about it in a
manner so thorough as to cause my blood
to chill again they spread out across
the bottom and were prying into every
nook and cranny

  one a miserable specimen of human-
ity looking ugly and fierce enough to
kill any man on sight was coming di-
rectly toward the rock behind which i
was crouching in another moment it
was certain that he would see me

chapter xiil

in oiosk touch with uruiv

  i nm not in this dire extremity lose
time in stupefied inactivity as  had
when i saw the yaquis coming up the
hill  fired

  but the fellow had already discovered
me and our two rifles barked their
venom almost at the same instant

  whether i was the better marksman
or had fired first the shots were too
close together to enable me to determine
but he fell and i was not touched

  but now quick and incessant action
was imperative i knew enough about
the nature of the yaquis and  still had
four to deal with

  swinging toward them as they
whirled toward me at the sound of the
firing  dropped down again behind the
big stone
by bullet persuasion



  pour times my repeating rifle let out
il voice and ns many or more shots
came from them

   could hear their bullets strike the
rock i could also see the cfleet of my
own shots at the third one of the four
fell forward on his face and at the
fourth another sat down suddenly and
bewail to examine his leg

  but it seems there is a reserve wisdom
in these fellows seeing that  was
backed by a stone wall and sheltered in
front by a rock that completely hid me
except when i peeped up to shoot the
two who had not been wounded or at
least not wounded enough to bring them
down now turned and ran

  i could have shot them even as they
fled but as they were going up stream
and therefore not in the direction i
wished to go i could sec no reason why
i should kill them

  i ran to where the least wounded of
the three was seated and grabbed up his
gun which was an old mexican weapon
once used by the army of that republic
then as he looked at me with murder-
ous hate gleaming from his eyes 
picked up the other two guns

  i had killed the first one  had iirod
at but i know the one who was mut-
tering and nursing his leg was able to
do all that was necessary for his com-
rades so i went on down-stream

  i had plenty of ammunition for my
own repeater and when i found a con-
venient spot  hammered the three old
mexican guns out of commission

  then with my own well-tried and
trusty rifle again fully loaded i went on

  and i went as fast as possible in
truth this was not very fast the
stream at the bottom of the gorge out
did the gorge itself in eccentricity and
zigzagged from right to left and from
left to right in such a way that about
half the time i was wading or making
some sort of bridge or ford

  nevertheless i did get ahead and
heard no more of the yaquis i had left
behind

  of water to drink there was plenty
but i was hungry fighting yaquis
makes one forget his appetite for a time
but the gorge was so peaceful and quiet
cxcept for the noise of the running
stream that it was difficult to remember

that only a short time before the canon
had reechoed with rifles fired in deadly
combat

  i felt no fear of immediate trouble
i doubted that the sound of a rifle would
go very far outside the gorge even if
it wont beyond the top at all there-
fore i was prepared to shoot whatever
i might see that was good to cat

  after perhaps half an hour more of
my laborious march keeping a constant
watch for food in some shape i spied
a bear sitting on his haunches on a
rocky ledge behind him there seemed
to be a cave opening

  lie saw me in his slow ungainly
way lie turned and began waddling
toward the cave  fired quickly and
hit him but he remained on the ledge
the next thing was to get him

  it was a difficult climb to the ledge
but the sight of food ready to be cooked
and eaten will take a hungry man up
almost any kind of rocky wall

  i was bending over my victim feel-
ing more pleasure than over the killing
of a yaqui when there was a growl be-
hind me and a larger bear rushed from
the cave with a pecular sliding noise
and clasped me from behind

  he was a powerful fellow and the
shock almost carried him and me over
the ledge i had fallen to the bottom
of the gorge once without serious injury
but those things happen so seldom i
felt no desire to try it again even with
a bear for company

  my rifle had been knocked from my
hand at the impact and i could not get
my hand into my pocket for my pistol
but like many others who lived near
the border besides carrying a rifle and
small revolver i had in a belt around
my waist under my jacket a long knife
to be used in preparing carcasses of
animals killed for food

   managed to get this in my right
hand and then tried to twist myself to
drive it into some vulnerable part of
my hairy adversary

  it was not an easy thing to do as
a matter of fact  didnt do it i
hacked away at his paws which merely
made him more angry

  my breath was being crushed out of
me and i must do something very soon
or this would be my finish
g

the argosy

   finding i could not turn i fell

  with a growl he began dragging me
toward the cave but my act of fall-
ing had so suddenly disconcerted him
that his grasp relaxed and before he
had rccloscd on me i had driven the
knife into his side three times

  i knew  had wounded him severely
but whether  bad reached his heart
sufficiently to disable him  could not
tell

  lie had his great front legs around
me and the pain of the wounds caused
bis grasp to tighten spasmodically till
i verily believed i was a gone case

  it bad so-happened without any plan-
ning on my part that i had fallen near
my rifle i succeeded in regaining pos-
session of that and jabbed the barrel
against bis side then  fired twicc

  i nearly killed myself possibly he
had been dying from the knife wounds
but when the bullet went into him and
then another be stiffened out in his
death throes and his embrace became
even more severe and when be was
dead i found i could not release my-
self

  here was now a situation turned in
a second from the tragic to the ridicu-
lous i bad been in danger from the
embrace of a great bear now there
was no danger but the bear bad so
tightened his hold upon me that i was
helpless

  shooting would do no more good and
i laid the rifle aside then exerting
my entire strength on one of hi thick
legs i pried at it till the perspiration
poured from me and yet i was no
more free than before

  but i continued to work wriggling
twisting and finally did squirm from
the big paws

  i certainly had plenty of food now
and was not ufraid to cook it there
would probably be n search for me both
by my own moquis il billy barefoot
got back his common sense and by the
yaquis and certainly by bonilla and
hernandez if they beard of what bad
happened

   but search or no search i was perched
on a ledge that was very difficult to
reach and on which but one man could
walk with safety at a time and near
me was a cave probably not inhabited

by any more beats with an opening so
small that  could hold out against a
dozen

  moreover i was well armed and
also bad food to last some time

  but  needed wood for a fire there
was plenty of it at the bottom and 
believed my agility if i had to climb
up on the ledge to avoid an enemy
would be sufficient to enable me to es-
cape him  dccidcd to cook my bear
meat down there  would want water
to drink anyway

   i slid the smallest bear off the ledge
and watched it go crashing down then
 made my way to the bottom 

   was well supplied with everything
needful having roamed the hills and
valleys of california enough to know
what to carry i bad a water-proof
match-box well filled a pipe and to-
bacco and a telescope drinkingcup

  i gathered a quantity of dry wood
and soon bad a fire

  it was no unusual thing for me i
bad eaten many a meal in the same way
if i had had consuelo there or had
known she was safe  would have been
as happy as in my own hunting-grounds
across the border

chapter xiv

a peaceful interlude

  perhaps it is because i have always
been hungry whenever  have killed a
bear while hunting or because i have
lived so long with only the mediocre
cooking of namona but certainly there
has never been anything so appetizing to
me as the odor of a big piece of juicy
lear meat cooking over a wood fire

   it requires some skill to cook this with-
out a smoky flavor but i had learned the
art fairly well

  and i enjoyed waiting for my dinner
because i knew it was going to taste
good

  the odor rose and floated out of the
gorge and i felt so secure that  even
laughed as i thought what an appetite
it would give the dinwerless yaqui who
was probably still taking care of the six
horses that had pursued me

  of course i had no salt or pepper
and no dishes nothing but my two
by bullet persuasion	

hands and my hunting-knife but i had
made good shift with these before

  and at inst my feast was ready i
replenished the firo and cut another great
hunk to roast for i had conceived an
idea

  sharpening a stick i speared the piece
i had already cooked and with my knife
cut off a thick slice

  taking this in my fingers i sent my
big and useful teeth through it and was
just in the glory of congratulating my-
self when  heard a grunt  had heard
no footsteps but this was the grunt of
a man  leaped up and seized my riile

  no need shoot cnmc a voicc and
the owner of the grunt came from be-
hind a slab of rock

  it was billy barefoot

  shod as he was in the heavy shoes the
indians bought from the agents his step
had been so light i had not heard it lie
was indeed well named

  he stood looking at me with a broad
grin and his eyes lit up when he saw
the bear meat

   jood  he exclaimed  very good
you shoot him  

   i shot him i said in no very
friendly way  i suppose in the name
of hospitality ive got to invite you to
have some ill tell you straight from
the shoulder though i dont feel like
it

  without changing his grin he calmly
sat down drew his own knife and cut
off a slice for himself

   good very good he said  how
you feel 

   i feel a good deal like youd feel i
suppose if youd been chased for miles
by a half dozen yaquis that wanted to
kill you been hurled from a horse down
a ravine and attacked again by the name
yaquis

   i know but they no kill you you
kill them

    killed one i wounded two but
it was not due to any extraordinary skill
courage or wisdom on your part what
the devil do you mean by hiding yourself
and the other five and then sending the
whole blamed village of yaquis after
me

  lie grunted out a laugh

   very good way now i explain
while you cat you mad with billy

barefoot yes but when i tell you
you wont be mad see  

   not yet i answered cutting an-
other slice

   hal just so now i tell you and
you wont be mad long time ago some
yaquis come to our place and steal two
moqui girls we come after them and
they come here

   yaquis are wild fierce bad indians
but they arc not like indians of our
country no they go like buffaloes
all in a heap and they fight fight
very bad

   that time i hide many long days
around this place i learn this gorge
i learn about the lake where they find
rubies yaquis no use have for rubies
but when you told about rubies i know
right away

   well we six moquis cant fight all
the yaquis so we shoot one side two
side three side four side they think
village surrounded and all go get guns
then they sec you

   we didnt know they would see you
we know they all go together some way
and so they did very bad they go after
you but they no shoot you so very good
now see they will go on little elk
run fast jim and red two legs all
together now they keep shoot shoot
all time and run so yaquis go on
and on so we dont fight tom mud
and bill faraway they meet us at lake

i come look for you i smell bear meat
know you great hunter and find you
very good i will cat some more bear
meat

  and he cut another generous supply

   well i rejoined somewhat molli-
fied by what he had said  i suppose
your explanation does really explain but
all the same wc camc here to find my
wife and take her home not to make
her a widow

  lie shook his sides with silent laugh-
ter

   dont make widow moqui indian
say good all the time till bad comes you
are notshot very good we get wife

   where is she have you learned
anything 

   yes ill show you to-morrow we
sleep here to-night

   sleep here why there arc yaquis
all around


the argosy

   no didnt i toll you they all go
after red two legs 

    hut will they all go 

   sure yaquis do that

   and leave their women and children
unprotected  

  they dont need protection no-
body harms them if the men drive away
the enemy

  it might have been good reasoning
from hln point of view  wasnt sure
of it myself

   theres a cavc up there on that ledge
and another bear

    pointed tip to the ledge

   well kill him

   he is dead i killed him

   you very great hunter all know
that

   t didnt know whether id find you
 said  and was going on alone i
imagined this stream might run into that
lake you speak of and i wasnt going to
get this far and go back without my wife
and i thought id cook plenty of bear
meat and put that in the cavc and if i
got my wife and namona i could hide
here for a while

  ah you think you yes well
do as you say

  ik straightway after taking a drink
of the pure water of the gorge began
hanging another piece of bear meat

   and wo take the other cut him dry
him very good

  i left this work to him and took my
ease with my back against the side of the
gorge after the scare he had caused
me it was just that he should do the
work

  wc slept that night on the ledge billy
told me to sleep without fear and he
would know if anybody came

  i know him well enough to feel confi-
dent of this and did sleep after my
experience  needed a good long rest it
was early morning when  woke

  billy was already up and was squat-
ting near me eating some more bear
meat i did the same

  wc took the cooked meat into the
cave it was not a very large cave and
was light enough to see well and we
made a clean place for the meat on a
kind of shelf

  the carcass of the larger bear he had
prepared in his own fashion and had

hung piccc on limbs of trees to dry
after smoking them a little over the fire
and performing some other stunts by
which indians can keep meat a long time

   now we go lie said

  with our riiles ready for instant
action we started billy leading the way
there was no conversation he trudged
along with that wonderfully silent and
wonderfully tireless gait of his and i
followed in his steps which were always
the best and safest when the water of the
gorge had to be crossed

  in this way we walked for probably
two hours and possibly more and the
nature of the gorge was now constantly
changing it grew wider and the depth
was lessening

  the water too was increased by the
addition of another trcam that fell in a
cascade from the top

  after a while we could see out through
the wide mouth of the gorge and beyond
there was a pretty little lake

  we could see only a small portion of
the lake and billy stopped

   come he said  climb up

chapter xv

a glimpse of consuelo

  climbjno was easy here billy led
the way up a rude flight of natural steps
in the rock going in a slanting direction
toward the mouth of the gorge as well as
toward the top and almost at the very
end of the ravine he stopped again

  wc were now on a broader tabic of
rock and the top was within reach

   keep still he said  tom mud
and bill faraway up here

  getting a grip on the edge he pulled
himself up then reaching down he
helped me

  there were three grunts when i was
on top the other two moquis were
there just as he had said

   now look there-that way said
billy barefoot

  i looked the lake was below us and
was surrounded by just such cliffs as
formed the walls of the gulch through
which we had come

  it was a place of marvelous beauty
the water of the lake seemed as clear as
that of the gorge and was perfectly still
by bullet persuasion



at the foot of the cliffs between them
and the lake there stretched a shingle
beach about six or seven hundred feel
wide and on this beach within easy
gunshot there was a house of logs

  on a rude bcnch evidently made on
the spot sat bonilla and hernandez
hernandez had a paper spread out on
bis lap and he was earnestly explaining
something to bonilla bonilla would
nod once in a while to show that he un-
derstood

  and standing in a listless attitude on
the shore of the lake with her hands
clasped behind her was consuelo

  although my acquaintance with her
had been so slight and my wish to marry
her due as much to my desire to help her
cscapc hernandez as it was to any in-
fatuation a man doesnt chase a girl he
believes to be his wife from one country
into another thinking about her all the
time without feeling more than when
she left him and i experienced a thrill
of pleasure and great love when i saw
her now 

  i could see that she was unhappy
the prospect of being compelled to
marry hernandez after all nust have
seemed appalling to her she was
dressed in a gown different from the one
she had worn when i had taken her home
to hide her she presented a neat ap-
pearance and was the picture of a beau-
tiful girl in distress

  i looked at her a long time she stood
so motionless so absolutely lacking in
interest in the beautiful scene before her
i longed to throw discretion to the winds
or the lake or anywhere and rush to
her side

  but this would never do

  some distance from this group there
was a camp pitched at the very foot of
the cliff and here there were at least a
dozen men they were not indians but
nevertheless were short dark and were
all down on the shingle playing cards or
some other game

  their intense interest in what they
were doing was evidence that it was some
game of chance

  i could see no horses although i knew
of course that nobody would come to that
place unless in the saddle and unless
they had had horses they would not have
been there so soon

  i wondered what they had done with
namona then i felt grave fears for
the woman for i remembered that it had
been the yaquis who took her away but
again came the remembrance that mrs
bonilla had said they had brought her
as a companion for consuelo

  my anxiety lasted only a short time
for my indian servant presently came
from the house carrying something she
went to where the two men sat and they
called consuelo

  she went evidently with great reluc-
tance then all took glasses and drank
something it was evident that despite
the difficulties of transportation hernan-
dez had somehow or other found a way
to supply the house with needful things

  we were situated where we could
watch with little fear of detection al-
though the region was not heavily wood-
ed there were clumps of trees and from
these we could see and not be seen

  when namona had returned with the
glasses hernandez got up he walked
along the shore a short distance and then
picked something up he returned to
bonilla

  he walked with evident difficulty he
limped and seemed to lean to one side
but i marveled that the man could walk
at all though many things had hap-
pened since it had not been so very long
ago that i had sent him home with bo-
nilla in a wagon

  it puzzled me until i recalled that
senora bonilla had said that at no time
had he been as helpless and badly wound-
ed as he had pretended

  i could realize that such a ruse might
have come into his bead for hernandez
certainly was no fool if by pretending
to be helplesb he could remain in led at
my house and watch and spy oil me ho
could perhaps find consuelo

  billy barefoot touchcd me on the
shoulder i followed his nod and wo
moved farther away

   now you sec he said  there are no
yaquis only peons that belong to her
nnndcz they arc not fighters like ya-
quis but they shoot

   what arc you going to do   asked
 even if they are only peons we cant
very well make an attack on so many

   no we must think we do noth-
ing now only wait
the argosy

   but the yaquis will conic buck

   not yet they get much angry not
catching red two legs and have fight
with soldier we have time must
not hurry iosc all

  there certainly was good logic in this
much as my impatience impelled mo to
hurry at once to my wifes side for
in my mind she was my wife without
doubt or cavil

  i cared not for that law or whatever it
was that debarred me because the justice
had not yet reached the words that made
us man and wife it had not been the
fault of either of us

  she was my wife and i was willing to
shoot up all mexico to get her

  the problem was not an easy one to
solve

  the peons had really done me no harm
of their own will and it was extremely
possible that they did not know that any
harm had been done

  they were there with hernandez and
if the father of a girl wants to take her
into such a place it was no business nor
concern of theirs

   billy i said  if i could get a
message to her we might get up some
scheme

   yes if we could

  the old moqui wrinkled his brow at
this thought it was going to be no easy
matter to get a message to consuelo
without attracting the attention of some
one tflse had there been no men there
except bonilla and hernandez i would
have thought it likely that namona
would go for water wherever they got it
and that might help out

  but with those men to do the work
there was little chance of even that hope
but that idea of getting a message to
consuelo was one with potentialities it
was not only good in itself but led up
to other good ones

  if i could get a message to her in
some way that nobody would suspect
billy barefoot and i could work out the
rest of it

  there was nothing to do but watch
and see what chances there were

so i lay down near the edge of the
cliff i feasted my eyes on her graceful
beauty as she moved slowly about al-
ways witfi that sad and listless manner
the three indians sat and talked in

their own tongue and played some game
of their own

  and now again the problem of food
confronted me i wondered that billy
had not thought of bringing some of the
bear meat with us but  knew the in-
dians would not go hungry and waited
till in their own fashion they would let
me know

   was aware that they never offered
information till it was due if  asked
the answer probably would be to wait
and see i suppose the difficulty they
had in expressing themselves in english
was the cause of this for they certainly
gabbled enough in their own tongue

chapter xvi

a novel schcmf

  my watch which  had not permitted
to run down and which had not been
injured by my fall told me as did also
a pretty healthy appetite that it was
noon and time for dinner but the three
indians were stolidly interested in their
play

  once billy looked up and i made a
motion of putting something into my
mouth

  he got up ending the game abruptly
and motioned for all of us to follow
we walked quite a distance away from
the lake and i found that my friends had
established a camp

   is this safe   asked

   yes they never come here and if
they do we arc indians and have a right
to live in the woods

  they had shot some game and we
made out to satisfy our appetites and i
smoked a while

  i could think of nothing else than get-
ting a message to consuelo often it
seemed to me that one of the moquis
could go in and speak to her but then
there was so much danger in that that i
gave it tip

  certainly i could not go myself

  having finished my pipe i went back
and returned to my occupation of watch-
ing but now there was nothing to
watch the peons were eating but con-
suelo and her father and hernandez had
disappeared undoubtedly into the house
since there was no other place to go
dy bullet persuasion	

  but i had not long to wait consuelo
came from the house alone and resumed
her old attitude ly the lake

  i wondered what was going on in her
mind i knew of a case where a woman
had stood like that on a river bank her
evident dejection attracting attention
and when somebody asked her if she was
ill she answered by leaping into the wa-
ter could consuelo  asked myself
be contemplating suicide

  this thought was so horrible that 
almost shouted to her

  she never looked upward to the edge
of the surrounding cliff but even if she
had i would not have dared to show my
self l could not let her see me without
giving all the others a chance to see too

  however if the thing was to be done
it must be some brand-new scheme i had
never heard of before

  i wondered how they got down there
hut knew of course there were ways of
scaling cliffs and there was probably
some easy method of descent

   thought if  knew where that was i
would sneak down at night and leave a
note where she could find it

  but then there were possibilities of
somebody else finding it

  consuelo strolled leisurely along the
lake shore then she hesitated and
stopped again

  next she stooped and picked some-
thing up from the ground i thought of
course it was a ruby but she stepped
to the waters edge and stuopud down
again

  she put what she had in her hand on
the water and gave it a push then she
began throwing pebbles at it

  as each pebble made a scries of cir-
cles in the water she stood and watched
them

  and yet she seemed to be taking no
interest in what she was doing it was
clearly the net of a girl harassed by
conditions her mind full of misery
yielding to an idle thought to relieve the
monotony

  but this simple act gave me the inspi
ration  needed i knew now what to
do

   it was riky to be sure but anything i
tried would be that and i was gain-
ing nothing by waiting bonilla had
come there to be convinced that there

were rubies and as soon as he was con-
vinced they would leave for home and
my chance would be gone

  i hurried back to billy barefoot

   here i said  ive hit on a plan
what do you think of this

   i listen he replied

   you have noticed that my wife
stands constantly by the lake looking
steadily into the water and sometimes
walks a little but always looking at the
lake and just now she threw in a piece
of wood and tossed pebbles at it

   now on the other hand nobody else
seems to have any use for the lake i
have not seen any one go near it the
mexican peons play their games and bo-
nilla and hernandez arc all the time at
that paper and i suppose after dinner
they smoke and drink wine

    now  am going to try this scheme
i am going to make a little boat oh
i am not to turn pirate and sail to the
rescue of my wife but i am going to
make a little boat that will sail and it
will have a little piece of paper for a sail
or a piece of white cloth and on this
sail will be written my message

   and there is a chance that she will
see the little boat and will wonder what
it is and will read the message

  the old moqui stared at me till i al-
most feared his eyes would pop out of
his head he showed not the least sign
whether he liked the scheme but just sat
and stared

   well i said testily  what about
it  you told me to think of something
and thats all  can think of

   huh

  lie got up and without saying any
more walked to the cliff

  the peons were lolling around smo-
king consuelo was strolling by the lake-
side just ns i said her gaze vacantly di-
rected toward the water her mind full
of the misery of her position

  billy pointed across the lake

   she never goes there what will
you do when your boat gets there 

  it was rather a problem i knew
nothing about the currents if there were
any in the lake it would be easy
enough to start the boat by launching it
inside the gorge and letting it sail out
on the bosom of the lake but which
way would it go then


the argosy

  there could be hut little breeze down
in that hole

    im going to try it i replied final-
ly if it goes on tin- other side ill
make another

  i confess that my knowledge of boat-
making was limited i could row a boat
but i couldnt whittle out a little man
to row this boat to consuelo rudders
were things of mystery to me

  but i went at it with a will and a
sharp knife and the three moquis stood
and watched me with owl-like faces try-
ing to understand what  was doing

  thi wasnt to be an elaborate toy boat
such as are sold in the stores all 
wanted was something that would sail
i was afraid of a simple hat piece of
wood

  as i progressed one of the two who
seldom spoke gave a grunt he quiet-
ly took the knife out of my hand went
to a tree examined it and stripped off a
piece of bark

  then began some indian stunts

  by whittling a piece of wood to make
a needle and by stripping the bark for
thread he had ready at hand his working

material

  and in an hour i had a bark canoe that
would float

  but i still had sense enough to know
that it would not carry a sail without
ballast i fastened a key i had on my
ring to the bottom and felt that this
key would hold the thing steady in what-
ever light wind it might encounter on the
lake

  of course when he had built a canoe-
of bark the indian had gone os far as
he could the rest of it was as big a
mystery to him as it was to me

   i fastened a little cleat at one end for
the mast next i made the latter then
i was stuck again

  if i wrote my message on paper and
the boat tippet over the message would
be destroyed  had nothing with which
to write on cloth  had not on my san
diego fig farm reachcd the dignity of a
fountain pen

    ink i said

  one of the indians darted away and
returned in ten minutes with some ber-
ries

   write much good he said

  i waited no longer

   here  said  take my knife and
cut off the sleeve of my hirt

chapter xvii

the pratk ship

  i did not of course intend to use the
entire sleeve and stopped him when 
had enough  put my mind next on the
method of using this

   knew there was such a thing as a
lug-sail and had seen pictures of the kind
of vessels using them so i fashioned
the linen in a square and then put on the
yard

   now i aid  weve got everything
but the message

  the berries were bruised and their
juice was a dark reddish fluid that
smelled horribly and would probably
stain the soul of a cast-iron monkey as red
as a fiends

   now my turn said the old moqui
 you write this at night when the guns
are fired she and namona come to you in
the ravine you meet them at the gorge
and go back to that cave stay there till
i come to you we must have horses
if they come keep inside the cave and
shoot

 it was the very thing there was
food in the cave and i knew when i was
there before that i could hold it against
a dozen trying to make my writing as
legible as possible i wrote this message

  mv nr ah wipe

  i am here watching von i have
  some moquis they will attack your
  place at night when you hear the nuns
  and have a chance get namona and
  come to the mouth of the tforge where
  the stream empties into the lake i will
  meet you there

  fear nothing if you dont want to
  ko back i will know if you do not come

  if you do want to go back dig in the
  sand with your foot

your loving husband

                     john dennv
                    f -

  i read this to billy

   good was all he had to say

  i now fastened on the sail and with a
feeling that somehow the plan could not
fail i went down the steps to the stream
 found a quiet little pool in which to try
my boat itefore i sent it on the voyage
hy bullet

persuasion



that meant so much to me and to my
great joy the little thing floated like a
duck

  i then blew on it to see which way a
breeze would send it and turned the rud-
der a little bit to keep it going near the
shore where consuelo was

  and then with my heart heating i put
it in the stream and let it go

  providencc sailed with that boat it
glided off and then caught by a little
eddy turned a little but caught its bal-
ance

  it wasnt a bad-looking little craft
considering how it was made

  when  wa convinced that my boat
would sail i climbed up ngain and went
to the edge to watch its progress

  there must have been a slight breeze
blowing through the gorge for to my
delight the little boat kept steadily on

  consuelo was still strolling around the
beach and hernandez and bonilla had
not come from the house and the boat
had to pass consuelo before it reached the
place where the peons were playing

  i was too much interested in watching
the boat to time its flight but it did not
seem a great while getting to consuelo
she was not looking in its direction and
my heart sank would she turn in time

  she was stooping down she picked up
something she seemed about to throw
a pebble into the lake she stopped with
her hand poised then it dropped to her
side

  she stood staring nt my venturesome
craft and then she turned and looked
right toward our end of the lake even
then i dared not show myself it was
enough that she saw it

  whether she suspected something or
not  did not know but she glanced
toward the house and then toward the
peons then she began strolling along
with the boat

  it was constantly drawing nearer the
shore and she kept pace with it and
my delight almost made me shout when
she took it from the water

  i watched her as she read the message
then i saw her tear it from the boat and
tuck jt in the bosom of her dress

  then she looked all around and see-
ing no one began digging with the toe
of her shoe in the ground

   huh i said billy barefoot

    a

  the other two said nothing but they
nodded their heads vigorously

  to-night  asked

    yes to-night

  that same night  was to have my
bride my heart thumped and pounded
as it never had before  felt that once
i had consuelo in my care i could not
lose her

  oh what a day that was  the after-
noon of course was nearly spent by the
time consuelo received the letter but
the remaining hours seemed the length
of centuries

  i did not ask the old moqui any ques-
tions about his plans all i knew and all
i wanted to know then was that that
night i was to meet consuelo and na-
mona and conduct them to the cave

  i ate a hearty supper and smoked and
smoked  needed no sleep it was far
from my thoughts

   we go said billy about midnight
 you go

   good-by old friend i sakl taking
his hand

   wc come with horses and they
were off

  i had to be enreful getting down the
steps for it was fortunately a dark
night when i reached the bottom i
waited

  i have not the slightest idea how long
i waited for the attack it seemed all
night but it was probably an hour

  then the crack of rifles told me the
game was on

  t could hear shouts and cries then
there came rifle-shots evidently from the
lake shore

  now  was hot and cold with fear
what if after all consuelo could not
escape what if the father and the lover
suspected what the attack meant and held
her back 

  suppose a bullet struck her by acci-
dent 

  it seemed to me there were millions of
things that could happen to frustrate my
plan after all

   i peered out into the darkness

   i could hear no footsteps

  the rifle shooting was going on at a
terrific rate nnd the shouting was inccs
sant

  suddenly-john where are you
came to my cars


the argosy

    here  said and in a moment i had
her in my arms

    wife of mine i  i cricd

  hurry sho said-oh in gods
name hurry they will kill me for this
if they get me again

   theyll never get you while i am
alive i told her  where i namona 

    here master she said in the dark

   then come it is dark i know but
it is safer than to have it light the
stream is not deep enough to drown in
consuelo you take my hand namona
take hold of consuclos dress and hang
on

   in this way i led them gingerly slow-
ly and tenderly along the gorge step
by step i felt my way for there was ample
time there would scarcely be any pur-
suit that night

   how did it work  asked  what
happened 

  oh said consuelo when i saw
that little boat  was startled i won-
dered who could be playing with boats
and thought that it must be some indian
boy but  saw when it got nearer there
was writing on the sail and when i
read it my heart almost stopped beating

    then when the attack came to-night
my father and hernandez ran out of the
house i railed namona and here we
are vo had no fime to bring anything

   we need nothing i said  what
you have will do till we reach home

  where are we going now asked

consuelo

   to a cave i discovered there is
food there and if we are pursued  can
hold it till the moquis come to our re-
lief

   how will you find it in the dark
asked my wife

   im wondering that myself wait -
i had a fire and cooked some bear meat
well find the cave all right

   anil we went on in the total darkness

chapter xvi

hv nultbt persuasion

  i was right about finding the spot
where i had built the fire and roasted the
bear meat  caught the odor of the fire
and meat and then stopped

  if i could smell it so could wild

beasts and there might be a dozen near
the spot this was disconcerting

  what is the matter asked consu-
elo  have you lost the way

   no but im going to make a light
there may be some kind of animal around
that meat

   i didnt know what to make a light of
i cursed myself for not thinking of that
during the daytime and preparing torches

   who has anything on that will
burn   i a-sked

   i have said consuelo- a lace
mantilla

    can you spare it  

    i can spare anything for you

  i took it from her hand and groped
around till i found a stick  wrapped
the mantilla around that and taking my
match box from my pocket soon had it
blazing

  the gorge made a wild weird picture
in the dancing finmclight and i waved
the torch around there was no sound of
anything moving and i could see notha
ing

   the light lasted till i had assisted the
two women to the ledge and showed them
into the cave after  had explored it first

   mflkc yourselves as comfortable as
you ran i said  i am going to sit
outside and keep watch

   may i sit with you a while asked
consuelo

    i should be happy to have you

  she came and sat beside me we
talked long and earnestly about the
future until consuelos head rested on
my shoulder and she slept

    kept my vigil faithfully till the dawn
and nothing happened but  knew that
a chase would be made after the two
women

  have i slept here all night asked
consuelo

  not quite it was almost morning
i fancy when wc got here now what
sort of place is that ring in the clilts
where you were how do you get down
there  

   why there is a path that winds up
and around it is difficult

   then your father would not think
you had gone that way in the dark

    lie would be more likely to think of
the gorge

   well well cat some bear meat and
by bullet persuasion	

then you had better get inside ill shoot
all even your father now you are my
wife

  i waited for two things i hoped that
billy barefoot would arrive with the
horses before bonilla found us but i
did not know where he was going to get
horses unless he stoic those lelonging to
hernandez and  didnt know where
they were

  it was about ten oclock when my
anxiou gaze down the ravine was grati-
fied the wrong way i saw bonilla
hernandez and half a dozen men com-
ing all armed with rifles

    at once got inside the cavc

  there was little hope that they would
pass the spot the remains of the fire
and the bear meat hanging in the trees
gave proof enough that it was somebodys
camp

   i was right

  here what have we here
houicd bonilla

  hernandez leaped to his side

   they have been here said hernan-
dez looking around  this fire has been
out only a short time here you fellows
search everywhere iook behind rocks
and into holes be careful

  the cavc was too light for all three to
remain unseen i crowded the women
against the rear wall and got my rifle
ready for business it was certain that
some one would discover me

  i had not long to wait some one was
climbing up a head showed in the
entrance to the cave

  here they are here the fellow
shouted

  i shot him and he fell across the cave
door

   what the devils shoot my men
came the voice of hernandez

  and you too hernandez i i yelled
back

   by heaven i that cursed ameri-
can f 

  i watched the mouth of the cave close-
ly i saw a rifle slowly protruded across
the entrance  fired at the wrist of the
the hand holding it and there was a cry
of pain the rifle dropped

  have you my daughter with you
asked the voice of bonilla

   come and see for yourself

   devil i you will shoot me

  like a dog i 

  fiend

 i knew there was no use parleying i
 was too intent on the entrance of the

 cavc

 a stone thrown by some one at the
 bottom came in and then a regular
 bombardment began none of the stones
 had any effect

  consuelo shouted bonilla  will
 you return with me if  do not kill the
 american  

  dont answer i said then i
 shouted myself  bonilla if any man
 gets in front of this cftvc he dies i am
 not afraid of you

 for a while there was silence it was
 manifestly impossible to shoot inside the
 cavc and throwing stones seemed to have
 little effect

 then there came the sound of a rifle at
 a distance

  his devils have come i heard bo-
 nilla cry

  we are safe i cried exultingly to
 consuelo  its old billy barefoot

 there were other shots and they were
 answered from near the cavc curses
 rolled up to us and the cries of the
 wounded

 i knew it would be a bitter fight for
 the old moqui would never rest till all
 of one side were gone

  help   heard bonilla cry  den-
 ny save me your men arc killing ours
 i do not wish to die

  we will not harm you said hernan-
 dez  give us the shelter of the cavc

  the argument of bullets is pretty
 strong eh i yelled with glee get
 out of range and stop shooting they
 wont shoot you and they will shoot your
 men

  i promise oh in heavens name i
 promise if you will stop this fighting 
 will give my consent yllcd bonilla

 you will let me have consuelo

  yes  swear it by the holy rosary

 and docs hernandez agree

  yes came the answer from hernan-
 dez

 shall i i asked my wife

  i would uot like my father killed
 and he will keep his word

  crawled from the tent taking my
 rifle i could sec the carnage that had
 been wrought
g

the argosy

  men lay on the ground dead or dying

  bonilla was still fighting but hernan-
dez was crouching behind a rock

   saw old billy barefoot and held up
my hand lie understood and the battle
ceased

  and now you go i heard hernan-
dez say and in spite of his promise lie
aimed his rifle

   stood on the ledge and shot him
through the head he fell at the feet of
bonilla dead

  there is little more to be told of the
remarkable story of how  won my wife
by the persuasive power of bullets with
hernandez dead bonilla had no longer
any reason to talk of consuelos marriage
to him and he did keep his word all
was plain sailing

  he had signed a partnership contract

with hernandez which he had in his
pocket he was now the owner of the
ruby-mine

  with him reconciled to our marriage
wc rode back to his hacienda where the
unfinished ceremony was performed
and then with his blessing and a goodly
wedding gift wc rode back over the bor-
der to the san diego farm

  sam was improved and the reunion of
him and his wife was a happy one as
for the six moquis who had gone and
come with me their return was so wcl
come that the tribe succecded in getting
some white mans fire-water and cele-
brated in royal style

  we are building a larger house now
and thanks o the ruby-mine it doesnt
make much difference whether the figs
grow or not

                           the end

money to burn

               uy walter duranty

              a terrific experience on a trestle and the more
              heart-rending discovery that followed on its heels

on the little south american repub-
lic of rio blanco every citizen who
is not a revolutionist aims at becoming a
member of the government but seflor
ulysse gaspado chief secretary to the
minister of finance looks anxious and
bewildered this hot august morning as he
sits on his wide veranda overlooking the
market square

  evidently an official position is not a
bed of roses after all and yet the de
partment of which he has charge is the
most nourishing in the state the money
affairs of the country are being adminis-
tered with unparalleled skill and success
and interest has actually been paid on the
national debt for rio blanco has a
financc minister whose boast it is that he
is a poorer man to-day than when he
entered office

  what is it then that troubles ulysse
gaspado and puckers his forehead into
this frown of perplexity

  perhaps he feels the strain of his work
in the hot weather or realizes that he is
not man enough to do it properly

  not so the finance department runs
like clockwork and gaspado knows well
his own merits

  wise as the foot of a mule they call
him in rio blanco-no light compliment
in this land of precipice and mountain

  the incongruous black mustache he has
inherited from his spanish father bristles
up to meet the fair eyebrows and lcck
llaxen hair that tell of a flemish mother
and his chubby dutch face lengthens in
perturbation

  scfior ulysse gaspado is worrying
about a lady

  for many a long day he has wooed
with flowery gifts and speeches the lovely
widow christina dacosta and last night
at the presidency ball she blushingly con-
sented to smile upon his suit

  but it is not right for an accepted lover
to be gloomy and troubled what then
is the matter

  is gaspado jealous or has he quarreled
with his lady

  no it is imply this she is unwilling
to marry him at once and leave rio blan
money to burn

g

co in order to spend their honeymoon in
europe

  when iaspado softly murmured his
desire for immediate union scftora dai
costa was at first surprised and then
amused by his ardor truly this was a
strange request from the stolid emotion-
less official whoe dutch appearance
seemed to deny his passionate spanish
love-words

  womanlike she asked the reason for his
request before refusing it and he showed
an unwonted confusion in his efforts to
evade a reply finally she declared that
she would never consent unless he told
her that she could not trust him for life
if he would not trust her now  and he
retiredbaffled to plan a new assault

   she is no foolish girl but an intel-
ligent broad-minded woman he mutters
to himself at last  i will tell her all
surely she will understand at any rate

i	can delay no longer

  his face clears as he gets up and walks
resolutely into the courtyard to summon
his carriage

  in spite of his determination iaspado
felt distinctly nervous as he embraced the
triumphant christina and assured her
that he had comc to tell her everything
in proof of his confidence in her love and
her discretion

   you must kpow he began abruptly
 that my superior anton parana minis-
ter of finance is a poor man in thirty

fears he is the first who has not enriched
limself from the national treasury

   yes indeed replied the widow
 and i rejoice that my ulysse is asso-
ciated with so worthy a man

  ulysse did not seem encouraged by her
remark and continued sadly

   ah but in spite of his reputation and
his boasts of honesty parana is not poor
by his own wish soon after i became
his secretary i perceived that he was
guilty of embezzlement of public funds

   by threat of exposure i compelled
him to repay the money then and restrain
his greed in future and at last seeing
that it was impossible either to steal or
get rid of me he actually began to pride
himself upon his enforced poverty as if
it was a proof of honor instead of inca-
pacity

   my clever ulysse sighed christina
 how splendid of you to foil his wicked

schemes but why should this hasten
your marriage-our marriage and she
smiled at him deliciously  why cannot
we be happier here than in a foreign
land  

   your charms are worthy of paris and
london replied ulysse gallantly  and
besides  wish to resign my position to
retire from office

  for a moment christina seemed aston-
ished then she cried enthusiastically

   ah now i understandmy thrice no
ble lover you cannot bear to remain
with parana-that old hypocrite whose
professions of virtue must disgust you
who know him as he is tell me that you
have resolved to endure it no longer but
why need we go to europe because of your
honorable resignation  

  again iaspado appeared embarrassed
after an uneasy pause he went on

  it is not quite that my dear though
of course i mean-in short there has still
been embezzlement in the finance depart-
ment money has been taken and

   and this time you cannot discover the
thief and arc determined to leave an office
that is tainted  

  no i know all about the affair
but-

   but it is a friend and you cannot
expose him my generous hero

   not exactly that is-well in fact to
put it plainly i took the money myself
and unless i get away by the next boat
therell be trouble and surely that is a
good enough reason for going parana
would give his ears to catch me tripping
so saying iaspado leaned back as if
relieved to have at last unburdened him-
self

  to his horror the woman did not
speak but her face grew white and old
and the light died out of her eyes

you stole it she gasped you
stole it and you ask me to share it-me
christina dacosta oh you reptile
her scorn roused him to self-defense
 if i had not taken it some one else
would it is always so in rio blanco-
in thirty years the finance ministers have
always grown rich it is the custom- 
 i do not carc for the custom i
thought i loved an honest man and i
find him a thief oh how i hate myself
for having permitted your approach i
but do not think she cried with a sud-


the argosy

lcn spasm of fury  that you will escape
with your booty  will denounce you to
parana lie will see to it that senor
ulysse gaspado the clever the able the
promising young statesman meets the
same punishment as the meanest sneak-
thief from the streets

  in a tempest of rage she swept out of
the room shouting for her coachman
leaving gaspado dazed and motionless a
if stunned by her outburst

  but his stubborn flemish blood soon
helped him f rally from the shock and
before scfiora dacosta had roused her
sleepy servants from their midday siesta
her disappointed lover was galloping
swiftly homeward alert and ready to
meet this sudden change in his affairs

  gaspado was too shrewd a man to have
only one string to his bow and he had
foreseen the possibility that his way to
europe might be barred the alternative
was to strike direct across country to the
neighboring republic of san jerome
where he would be safe and whence he
could easily take an cast-bound steamer

  lie would make for the frontier of los
diablos where the new railway crossed
the american built trcstle-bridge over the
blanco river into san jerome once on
the other side he could laugh at pursuit
and then for paris and the delights of
civilization

  	was characteristic of the man that he
did not mourn for his lost love as he
rapidly assumed the disguise he had prc-
pared and stuffed the crisp english notes
and rustling american bills into a thick
leather wallet

  ulysse laspado was never one to cry
over spilt milk

  senora dacotas coachman was lazy
and her horses were fat so that at the
very moment when bland clerks were
assuring the indignant lady that it was
out of the question to see sefior parana
at that hour but that she might apply to
his secretary senor gaspado an unpre-
tentious little man with gray hair and
whiskers trotted briskly out of the town
in the direction of san jerome on a horse
that might perhaps have seemed rather
too good for so humble a traveler

  as the splendid animal settled into his
stride for the fifty-mile journey gaspado
thanked the saints not only for his escape
so far successful but also for having re-

vealed to him in lime the absurd and
uncompromising honesty of the lady he
might have married

   and to think he muttered  that
her late husband was also a politician
no wonder the poor man is dead who
would have imagined that she would have
behaved like that she did seem so in-
telligent 

  with a sigh of wonder at the strange-
ness of women he dismissed the subject
and devoted himself to pleasant dreams
of a glorious future in the capitals of the
old world

  the town of los diablos was on the
other side of the blanco river two
miles this side of the river there was a
small station then the line of the railroad
swept up ill a great curve to the new
trestle bridge which spanned the foaming
torrent

  though gaspado did not expect that
he would be traced he prudently avoided
the station and dismounting shortly be-
yond it unsaddled his weary horse and
sat stiffly down to consume a hurried
meal preparatory to walking over the
bridge into san jerome

  it was now half past ten oclock and
there would be a train an hour before
midnight the heat had been followed
by thunder and torrential rain which
soaked him to the skin and the flooded
stream roared loud in his ears as he
plodded wearily round the curve of the
track on to the bridge

  lie had gone only a few yards when
his foot slipped on the wet planking and
he fell full length across the rails he
lay half stunned for a moment and then
tried to get up

  he could not rise his leg seemed
caught lie struggled to move in vain
the foot was gripped tight between the

timbers

  he made a strong effort raising him-
self on his hands and pushing with his
other leg but failed utterly and sank
down breathless

  supposing he could not get loose he
would miss the train the train i good
heaven he lay right in its path

  the thought set him wrenching madly
again at his imprisoned leg fighting sob-
bing tearing at the slippery wood in an
agonized strain upon every muscle in his
body
money to burn



  exhaustion compelled him to abandon
the struggle he lay there gasping his
burning check against the wet iron even
at such a moment he derived a leeling of
relief from the coolness of the metal

  the physical weakness cleared his
brain and stemmed his terror he must
face the situation calmly it was impos-
sible for him to free himself he must
shout and stop the train

  but would they hear him the roar
of the flood and the blast of the tempest
would surely drown his feeble tries then
he dragged off his coat and plucked at his
drenched shirt to wave it as a flag of
warning

  as his fingers snapped the collar-
hutton he suddenly became conscious that
it was night and dark very dark the
lamp at the entrance of the bridge sent
too wan a ray to show the waving of a
flag

  what was he to do as he clasped
his dripping forehead and looked out into
the darkness he saw far off a glimmer-
ing light low down like a newly risen
star dumbly he stored at it the only
sign of life in all the waste of blackness
then with a pang he realized what it
was- the headlight of the train

  desperately he fought for self-control
there was the great curve-perhaps he
had still ten minutes ten minutes to
think for his life for all the joyous future
he had promised himself

  suddenly an idea came to him he
would light a flame of some sort
matches yes here they were safe and
dry in the metal box paper paper

  with tense haste he plunged his hands
into pocket after pocket nothing-noth-
ing

  ah an envelope-drenched and sod-
den with the rain at last he drew out his
wallet now he could feel dry paper-
the thick leather had done its duty well
he fumbled among the crinkly bills
there was no other paper

  could he spare a few to save himself

the light was nearer now reluctantly
he struck a match and carefully shield-
ing the tiny flame from the wind watched
it cat into one of the slips of paper for
which he had sold his honor with which
he must now buy his own life

  the flame flickered weakly as the hiss-
ing rain-drops struck it and the light of
the train came on

  another bill he sacrificcd and another
and another-slowly as though they
were the drops of his own hearts blood
then with teeth set to the resolve he
burned two and three then five or six
at a time

  still the light of the train came on
it was very near now and the man was
half-crazed with fear as he flung the bills
upon the blaze heedless of the smart and
sear of his blackening fingers still the
light of the train came on

  in the panic-agony for his life he had
forgotten what the rolls of paper meant
as lie held them to the flame and tossed
them wildly into the air one big roll-
the last-there it is alight now lie waves
it aloft like a torch

  will they sec it no no yes the
train stops at last-right by the entrance
to the bridge a voice that did not seem
to e his own shouted feebly

  they come and forccd open the death-
trap with iron bars

   i got caught he cried- i got
caught

   hell i said the big scotch engineer
 id never ha thought to see a mans life
saved by a hot box why wed never ha
toppcd-

   what do you mean  cried gaspado
didnt you see the light i made it
burnt my fingers

   lord-no i little we see in a storm
like this you are a lucky mail this
night wc stopped for a hot-box thats
all

  and that is how ulysse gaspado ex-
secretary to the minister of finance came
penniless to san jerome

           a ditty

my true-love hath my heart and i have his

  by just exchange one for another given

i hold his dear and mine he cannot miss

  there never was a better bargain driven

an elusive legacy

by iiarlan g stbelb

         wliat happened when a photographer closed out his himnca to drop
         into a supposed bed of roses and found a mares nest of trouble instead

chapter 

tiie ii kir at i aw

to be acclaimcd n hero-to breathe
for one brief hour the intoxicating
aroma of public applause and then-
to be chased out of town on a fifteen
minutes headway like u common tramp

  ab what a fall is that my country-
men 

  it nil came about through uncle
johns legacy dick behan after an
apprenticeship in one of the large down-
town galleries had established himself in
the photograph business in a small way
with a studio just off third avenue on
the upper east side of new york city

  the stand was supposed to be a good
one for old pinchot two blocks below
who was a much inferior craftsman was
said to have made a fortune but after
a two years try at the job dick found
himself unable to do much more than eke
out a living-and a pretty precarious
living at that

  it was not that he was lazy or given to
bad habits unless an almost infatuated
devotion to photography can be termed
a bad habit it was simply that the
artistic rather than the commercial side
of his vocation appealed to his nature

  a wedding party who wished to be
taken in stiff conventional attitudes
with the grooms white-gloved hand laid
like a protecting hour-sack on the brides
shoulder would be driven from his doors
by scathing ridicule  while the doting
mother who wanted a clean hard print
of her pudgy offspring sans clothing ami
seated in a wash-bowl could hardly be
blamed for complaining when she re-
ceived instead a sketchy impressionistic
thing of dark rembrandtish shadows

  shurc exclaimed mrs orafferty
in towering disgust  th insultin shcoun-
dlirel made me little aloysius look like a
coon 

  again if there came a heavy snow-
fall transforming the ugly streets and
squalid tenements into things of beauty
with its mantle of white or if the park
was all ablow and the sun shining on
some rare june day nothing could pre-
vail upon behan to remain in his shop
and wait for possible sitters

  with camera slung across his shoulder
he would be out ranging the countryside
snapping a lovely bit of nature inland
or pausing on some solitary shore to focus
the wild tumble of the waves upon the
beach

  these frequent absences coupled with
the upper east sides lack of apprecia-
tion for rembrandtish effec ts were not
conducive to the accumulation of a bank
account on the contrary custom so
steadily dwindled that at last it had be-
come a serious question how the next
months rent was to be scratched up to
say nothing of necessary supplies iniard
lodging and other expenses

  then just at this inauspicious moment
came the news that crusty old uncle john
bad died intestate and that dick being
the sole surviving relative was heir at law
to his entire fortune

  behans first emotion upon receipt of
the tidings was one of dazed incredulity

  he had never seen his uncle indeed
he had almost forgotten the existence of
such a relative all lie could remember
was that his father and this brother had
quarreled long ago and that for over
twenty years there had been no communi-
cation of any kind between his family and
the grim old bachelor

  true he was aware in a vague way
that uncle john had prospered and was
supposed to be wealthy but as to ex
pecting any personal advantage from
that fact he would just as soon have
looked for the ceiling of his studio to
open up and rain gold dollars down upon
him


an elusive legacy



  could such a thing really happen to
any one outside a story-book and
especially to so unlucky a beggar os

himself

  it seemed hard to believe yet lie was
certainly not dreaming for there before
him lay as tangible evidence a brief
businesslike notification from his late
uncles attorney together with a news-
paper obituary describing the deceased as
a  retired capitalist

    retired capitalist 

  what an opulent care-free sound the
term had it signified money safely
invested in solid securities a regular in-
come paid at stated intervals entire
absence of financial fret or worry the
liberty to travel to entertain ones friends
to enjoy life in any way one chose

  for a moment behan felt an involun-
tary pang of envy for the being so hap-
pily situated  then as his glance fell once
more on the lawyers letter the thrilling
realization dawned upon him that he was
now one of these fortunate beings him-
self

   a great sense of relief swept over him
he snatched up the missive again as
though to reassure himself and scanned
it with eager eyes

  yes it was true-actually and undeni-
ably true no more would he have to
give up his time and talent to uncon-
genial labor no longer wouhl he be
obliged lo retouch heavy wooden faces
in the effort to give them some semblance
of humanity or caper like a monkey to
attract the supercilious attention of
 drooling brats he was free

  lie shook his finger playfully at the
big camera over on the other side of the
room

   no more  demnition grind for you
and me old girl i  he cricd  wc arc
now  retired capitalists we have joined
the ranks of the plutocrats

  under the circumstances a show of
grief upon behans part would have been
rankest hypocrisy  nevertheless he con-
ducted himself with a fitting regard for
the proprieties and paid all due respect
to the memory of his departed kinsman

  he went at once to ravenswood the
little town where uncle john had re-
sided attended the funeral in the
capacity of chief mourner and sedu-
lously molded both his mien and manner

so as to give no indication of his inward
elation

  installing himself as master in the big
house where the old man had maintained
a hermit-like existence for so many years
he met all callers with an impressive
decorum and quite won the old house-
keepers heart by assuring her that she
need fear no changes in the present
menage

  by the end of a week however he de-
cided there would be nothing amiss in
gratifying his natural curiosity and
therefore one bright morning strolled
down the main street of the town to the
ofiice of g weatherby the lawyer who
had notified him of his windfall

   weatherby a somewhat saturnine-
looking individual glanced up from a
perusal of the morning paper with a
quizzical gleam in his deep-set eyes as his
caller entered

   ah young mr behan i believe he
drawled without rising from his seat
 do yon know ive had a sort of pre-
monition that youd be dropping in before
long felt it in my bones as the old
couniry people around here ay

   dick realizing that he had to deal with
an eccentric merely smiled good-na-
turedly

   suppose you had unexpectedly tum-
bled into a gold-mine mr weatherby
he retorted  dont you think youd le
templed to look around a bit and see just
how much ore was in sight 

  the attorney glanccd up at him sharp
ly and then went off into a scries of
noiseless chuckles

  tumbled into a gold-mine he
ejaculated again his facc contorted and
his sides shook  that is the best thing
i have heard in years oh its good-
very very good

  behan began to grow a trifle annoyed
he was conscious of having said nothing
very original or amusing and this laugh-
ter seemed to him anything but the proper
attitude of a counselor toward one of his
most important clients

  that is all very well mr weather-
by and he spoke a shade huffily  but
i came down this morning for a business
conference not to pose as a comic sup-
plement perhaps then we had letter
get down to a discussion of my affairs

  the others peculiar mirth ceased as


the argosy

suddenly as it had begun again his face
assumed its habitual expression of bored
indifference

  your affairs eh and the man
stroked hir chin  well what do you
want to know about em

   everything succinctly

  hm thats a pretty large order
looking at it in one way and perhaps not
so large looking at it in another maybe
in order to save time you had better ask
me in the form of direct questions
exactly what you want to find out

   well then roughly speaking what is
the value of my inheritance

   the value of your inheritance that
i should say is very much as you may sec
fit to estimate it

  as i may see fit to estimate it

   yes six months ago it was easily
worth one hundred thousand dollars
now it may be worth double that or- 

  visions of rapidly enhancing wealth
danced through the young mans brain

  or he demanded excitedly

   not one darned cent replied wcath-
crby

chapter ii

co west young man

  for a second dick was bowled com
pletely over never doubting for an
instant from all he had heard and ob-
served that his uncles death had ren-
dered him independently rich the law-
yers brusk announcement struck him
with all the effect of an unexpected
bucket of icc-water dashed suddenly upon
liiit glowing hopes

   wha-what do you mean  he stam-
mered recoiling a step

  in that moment of surprise the thought
came to him that possibly this weatherby
might lie attempting some crooked deal-
ing and his brow darkened but the
other speedily dispelled any such suspi-
cion

   no as an answer to the unspoken
suggestion an investigation will easily
convince you that i am in no way con-
cerned the facts are simply that your
uncle a short time before his demise
went rather heavily into a gold-mining
proposition which may or may not result
in profit

   now you will understand he
added  why i had to laugh when you
spoke of having tumbled into a gold
mine and why i said that the value of
your legacy was very much what you
might chouse to consider it

  but dick was paying very little heed
to the semi-apology

   a gold-mining proposition eh   he
muttered  of course a large number
of such schemes are frauds and swin-
dles but my late uncle i have been
given to understand was a very careful
man of business a regular-

   a regular screw and miser eh
well so john behan was but  wouldnt
advise you to bank too strongly on that
indeed my experience has taught me that
those are the very people who prove the
easiest marks for the  con men and
bunko sharks why if it wasnt for
tight-fisted old farmers whx will squeeze
a dollar until the eagle shrieks the shell-
game and the seductive gold brick would
long since have become relics of the
past

   you mean then broke in dick ex-
citedly that uncle john fell for a
swindle which has swallowed up a good
share of his estate

   no-o returned weatherby with the
caution of his craft  that is a little
stronger than i would care to be quoted
i simply vll you that your legacy is at
present tied up in shares of the vcrdcc
mining and smelting company what
they may be actually worth either now
or in the future i am unable to state

   but your opinion persisted dick
 is that the whole affair is a monstrous
swindle 

  weatherby hesitated a moment then
seizing his caller by the arm he drew
him over to a window which looked out
upon the main street

   do you see that old chap over there
on the steps of the bank with the crowd
around him he asked

  following the direction of the pointed
finger behan perceived a portly and
prosperous figure silk-hatted ruddy-
faced and gray-sidewhiskered holding
forth to a group of men who seemed to
hang entranced upon his utterances

   that said the lawyer  is colonel
simeon p jones our local edition of the
 pied piper of hamclin about six
an elusive legacy



months ago he landed in ravenawood
with ft satchel full of quartz specimens a
book of handsomely lithographed stock
certificates and a glittering tory of a
gold mine at verdec british columbia
which only needed development to prove
a second comstock

   i dont suppose that you being a
new yorker the lawyer proceeded
 can realize how easy it is to work one
of these rural burgs not that you or
i or any other decent man could do it
they wouldnt listen to us if we offered
them ten-dollar gold pieces for one dollar
and ninety-eight cents but let some
fellow they never heard of before come
along with a scheme they know nothing
about and if he has a silk tile gray mut-
ton-chops and a plausible tongue they
will flock to him as though he were an
inspired oracle

   to cut the story short ravcnswood
has contributed not les than a million
dollars to colonel jones and in that
contribution is every dollar of your uncle
johns fortune

   every dollar gasped dick

  at the worst he had not supposed the
estate was more than impaired

  yes sir every blamed cent mr
behan seemed to go fairly daft over the
enterprise i tell you nothing that i
or any of his other usual advisers could
say had the slightest effect stocks
bonds securities of every sort he turned
into cash and dumped into this precious
scheme

   but the real estate surely that big
house must be worth considerable and
there is a farm besides is there not  

   mortgaged up to the hilt every last
stiver of it and the money gone to colo-
nel jones

  in brief the other finished you
might as well know at the start mr be-
han that your inheritance consists solely
and entirely of stock in the venice
mines and what that may be worth

i-

  but dick stopped him with a wave of
the hand he had drawn his own con-
clusions from what he had heard and
from the appcarancc of the man across
the street to his mind  shark  was
written in every line of colonel joness
bland and smiling personality

  an ominous scowl upon his brow he

rose to his feet and started impetuously
for the door but weatherby with sur-
prising agility sprang out of his chair
and managed to head him off

   what would you do he demanded

   get my money back from that old
fraud stormed dick  or else take it
out of his hide

   nonsense the lawyer cut in with
cool dispassionate argument  this is
a case for craft not for violence in
the present state of public sentiment
here you would accomplish nothing ex-
cept to get locked up on a charge of as-
sault and battery there is a better way
than that to get satisfaction

   how

   well a million dollars can hardly
be so cunningly diverted but that some
clue will le left as to where it has gone
so if i were in your shoes i would waste
no time here but would go out to ver-
dec and find out for myself just how the
land lies and what colonel jones is
doing with all this money

   but questioned behan  urely
some of the folks here have made an
investigation of the property have they
not you dont mean to tell me they arc
quite such gillies as to have swallowed
all that was told them without at least
attempting to look it up for themselves

   oh yes they investigated it as-
sented weatherby with an ironic smile
 that is they clubbed together and sent
george prentice the bank president out
there to look into things for them with
the result that he brought back the most
glowing report that one could wish
prentice is a good honest fellow you
see square as a die and a first rate
banker but again the lawyer smiled
 what he doesnt know about mining
would probably fill several books

   still broke in dick eagerly  he
has been on the ground and ought to be
able to tell me something of the real
conditions where can i find him
pray 

  you cant find him not unless you
go to verdec prentice you must un-
derstand has been made president of the
company and has gone out there to take
personal charge of its affairs

  dick looked frankly puzzled

   but he questioned  if that is so
what need is there for me to go to vcr-


the argosy

 dcc you say this prfntice is honest
then since he is president of the com-
pany what chance is there for sculdug-
 gcry 

     hah   weatherbys lip curled  you
 surely must know that the president of a
 company is very often merely a figure-
 head simply occupying that position to
 be more easily hoodwinked colonel
 jones with significant emphasis is
 general manager

    now mark you and he oncc more
 assumed a tone of guarded caution  
 am not asserting that there is anything
 crooked in the deal i only say that
 prentice might easily be in a position
 where he would find it almost impossible
 to get at the real facts

   then you think-

     i think observed wcatherby re-
 hectively  that if i were in your shoes
 i would say nothing to anybody but
 would slip out to vcrdee unheralded and
 investigate matters there for myself

    behan could not but assent to the wis-
 dom of this suggestion  yet as he did so
 he colored up and looked embarrassed

   ah said wcatherby readily di-
 vining the trouble  a little short of
 cash are you well that can be reme-
 died i think there arc a few odds and
 ends still left to your uncles estate which
 will probably bring in something give
 me a power of attorney to dispose of
 them for you and i will advance the
 money you need for present expenses

    accordingly it was so arranged and
 the papers having been duly chrawn up
 and signed dick left to pack up and
 prepare for his trip to the northwest

    for some time after he had left the
 lawyer sat gazing at the power of attor-
 ney with an enigmatic smile upon his
 lips then he stepped over to the tele-
 phone and called up the office of colonel
 j ones

     its all right coloncl he said with
  a touch of elation  he leaves for ver-
  dce to-morrow morning i 

chapter iii

the flower that blooms in the

sprino

    dick was early at the station the fol-
 lowing day and while he loitered along

the platform waiting for wcathcrby who
had promised to come down and sec him
off he caught his first glimpse of  daf-
fodil

  he christened her that in a flash of
poetic inspiration the moment his eyes
fell upon her

  tall willowy and graceful she wore
a trim linen shirt waist a soft gray-
green traveling skirt with the jacket to
match hung over her arm and above the
twists of her shimmering fair hair a
wide flat hat shrouded in a gray veil
and wreathed with a circle of yellow
corn-flowers

  hut inevitably as her ensemble remind-
ed him of those delicate blossoms of
early spring he so loved to arrange in
artistic poses before his camera it was
not that so much which made the name
 daffodil  leap to his lips as the smile
which came and went upon her bonny
face-a smile winsome and sunny as the
drop of gold which nestles in the flowers
heart

  leaning against a post dick stood at
one side watching her stirred at the sight
of such engaging loveliness yet never
for a moment dreaming that the experi-
ence was other than one of the fleeting
incidents of travel

  hut to his surprise when weatherby
presently joined him the lawyer lifting
his hat to the radiant vision murmured
good morning miss daffodil then
with a quick clutch upon his companions
arm drew behan around the corner of
the building

  daffodil cxclalmcd dick incredu-
lously is that really her ame

   yes with evident annoyancc  that
is george prentices daughter and she
is leaving to spend the summer with her
father out at verdee was anything
ever more unlucky than that she should
choose this train

  unlucky thought dick

  then he turned eagerly to the other

   you mut introduce me weather -
by he said  it will relieve the tedium
of such a long journey for us both

  the lawyer shied away from the propo-
sition like a frightened horse

  are you crazy he protested
 what chance is there for you to visit
verdee incog with her knowing all about
you no the only thing for you to do
an elusive legacy



is to wait over a day longer and take
to-morrows train wc can but hope
that she wont recognize your face after
you get there and place you as some one
from ravenswood

  but behan scoffed at such nn excess
of caution and  ridiculed the idea of
delaying his departure that finally espe-
cially since he did not further press his
desire for the introduction weatherby
gave a reluctant assent

  it must not be supposed however that
the young man had hy any means re-
linquished his yearning to meet and know
the charming girl whose name had so
appositely leaped to his lips

  it occurred to him rather that by
leaving the matter to chance his wish
was almost certain to lie accomplished
and that too without necessarily dis-
closing his identity lie knew that a
long railway trip is like an ocean voyage
conducive to informal acquaintanceship
and he felt also that should necessity
arise he hnd a very potent instrument
wherewith to break the social ice in the
little black box with the sliding shutter
which he carried in its leathcr-case at
his side

  therefore in deference to weather-
bys entreaties he did not follow her into
the pullman when the train steamed into
the station but boarding an ordinary day
coach rode a hundred miles or so up the
road before he finally claimed the berth
which lie had engaged

  nor when he ultimately went back
did he intrude himself at all upon her
notice his play for the present he felt
was like that of the philosophic  brer
rabbit to  lay low an say nullin  
and wrapped in his seeming indifference
he richly enjoyed the discomfiture of
the two or three other male passengers
who endeavored to obtrude officious and
unwelcome attentions upon the girl

  the second day out though he had an
opportunity to show her otic or two small
courtesies in a natural gentlemanly fash-
ion and nt last during the afternoon
when the train stopped at a division
point to changc engines he decided that
his time had come

  miss prentice pinning on her hat left
the car for a stroll up and down the
platform and behan snatching up his
camera followed hard in her wake

  to all appearances the two were com-
pletely oblivious of each others prcscncc
on the fifty feet or so of asphalt which
they mutually occupied  but the photog-
rapher casting an occasional surreptitious
glance out of the corner of his eye did
not fall to note that as he produced his
camcra and started to operate it the girl

grew visibly interested

  unconsciously her pace seemed to
slacken when she passed him in her brisk
up-and-down saunter and she threw
more and more frequent glanccs over
her shoulder in his direction

  at last she paused hesitated and
drew near

   dont you think that would make a
prettier picture of the place she sug-
gested diffidently pointing in the oppo-
site direction from that in which behan
was aiming his lens  at least that is
how i should like best to remember the
place

  dick turned carefully concealing his
elation and scrutinized through half-
dosed eyes the prospect she had indi-
cated - a stretch of meadow-land
through which ran a winding river in the
foreground and farther on the cluster-
ing houses of the little town with an
artistic detail of gray stone church tower
to the rear

  he glanced from her to it and back
to her again then lie decided that the
fitting time had come to make a bold
stroke

   yes he said slowly  it would
make an ideal view-with one addition

  one addition she questioned
what is that

   you in the front of it he answered
with a laughing sparkle of challenge in
his eyes

  for a moment he feared he had been
over-precipitatc she flushed bit her
lip vexcdly and seemed about to turn
away

  but after all it is a rare beauty who
can resist the fascination of being photo-
graphed and daffodil was no more im-
mune to the spell of the little black box
than the majority of her sisters

   wc-cll she assented at last that
is if you arc really certain the picture
needs a figure in it to give proper effcct
but tell me first she paused with anx-
ious inquiry is my hat on straight


the argosy

  and dick knew by this that he had
gained her confidence

chapter iv

masquerading as olt acquaintances

  they were both so engrossed in the
taking of the picturc that they entirely
failed to hear the conductors warning
 all aboard  and were only recalled
to their situation by the grindof the
starting wheels upon the rails

  then they had to scamper for it and
it may be remarked in passing that noth-
ing so tends to overcome any lingering
stiffness between two young people as a
brisk run with a common purpose in
view

  flushed and panting they scrambled
up on the platform together and if be-
hans arm encircled the girls waist a lit-
tle longer and a little more ardently than
was strictly necessary ho may perhaps
be excused on the score of a natural fear
lest she might fall

  at any rate she did not seem to re-
sent il for after gently disengaging her-
self and smoothing back her ruffled hair
while she regained her breath she broke
into a ringing laugh

  that was worth while wasnt it
she said with unaffected zest  i havent
had such an exciting racc sincc i was a
little girl in short frocks but oh
with a sudden anxiety  i do hope you
didnt lose the picture

   never think it he assured her  i
have it safe all right patting the little
box upon his arm  why t would have
missed all the trains for the next week
rather than lei il go

   and have kept me posing there all
the time heedless of my hunger or thirst
without a qualm of compunction eh
she bantered  that i suppose i what
you call the artistic temperament

   well the artistic temperament
doesnt prevent me from being hungry
tight now he retorted with a smile  i
dont know how you feel about it but
that little whiff of fresh air and the
sprint has raised quite an appetite on my
side of the iuc what do you say to a
foraging trip to the buffet-car wc can
probably find a club sandwich and some-
thing to go with it back there

  daffodil hesitated she was traveling
unchapcroned and it behooved her to be
wary in her acceptance of courtesies from
chance acquaintances of the male persua-
sion no  really nice girl  would she
knew listen for a moment to such a prop-
osition

  still this good looking young fellow
was so indubitably a gentleman so in-
genuous ami frank and a club sand
wich did sound enticing

   but i dontknow you she wavered
 we are absolute strangers

   oh but that is speedily remedied
he rejoined well pretend as the
children do and the game is that i as
mr breen and you as miss parsons-
those are not our real names of coursc
but they will do as well as any other-
arc old acquaintances and by a delight-
ful chance happen to have met again on
this train that would obviate all
trouble with the convenances wouldnt
it

   besides he urged  since wc arc
both going to verdee i have a very
strong fancy that wc will shortly be pre-
sented to each other in due and proper
form so wc arc in a way only forestall-
ing our acquaintanceship a little

  it was this final argument which evi-
dently carried weight with miss prentice

   but she questioned  if that be 

why can we not start off under our true

colors in the first place  

   oh no  that would never do at all
he quickly demurred  under our true
names wc cannot possibly be old friends
and our conduct would be therefore
highly reprehensible and improper but

an elusive legacy



have because that is the one thing you
dont know how to do

  accordingly  mrs grundy  having
thus been whipped around a stump the
two adjourned in high feather to the
dining-car and there spent a diverting
half hour or so constructing over their
sandwiches and tea all manner of fan-
tastic reminiscences of their mutual ex-
pcricnccs in  anyoldtown

   after that it was of course impossible
that there should remain anything stand-
offish or reserved in their respective atti-
tudes indeed by the end of the second
day out their little fiction seemed almost
to be based upon the truth such good
comrades had they become and so long
did they seem to have known each other

  happily dick was wise enough not to
attempt to encroach upon his advantage
and the girl seeing and admiring this
restraint upon his part was all the more
open and friendly with him

  more than oncc she would have broken
away from their agreement and told him
who she was and all about herself if he
had not prevented her

   no he would plead   our new ac-
quaintance will begin plenty soon enough
let us hold to the old one while wc have
the chance

  and then he would draw off her at-
tention by suggesting that he take an-
other photograph of her

  ah the snap-shots that were made of

 miss prunes-and-prisms  during those
four halcyon days there were snap-
shots of her in the car and out of it
walking standing sitting eating drink-
ing smiling frowning in almost every
conceivable attitude and pose and  then
some

  it was an idyllic experience nnd both
of them grew a little pensive and thought-
ful as they stood together on the rear
platform the last night of their trip
while the train pantingly climbed the
steep mountain grade toward verdee

  they had comc out there to take a
flash-light of some curious natural rock
formations which the conductor had told
them would be well worth preserving
these phenomena were just at the end of
a deep cut through which they had to
pass and the official had obligingly con-
sented to stand by and give the signal for
the flash at just the proper moment

  into the cut they rumbled slowly and
behan his apparatus all in readiness
stood poised for the word

  but as lie waited the train came to a
halt with a suddenness which nearly
jerked them all off their feet and out of
the darkness ahead was borne back to
their cars a melee of quick voices and a
fusillade of pistol shots

   a hold-up by thunder  gasped the
conductor hiving back into the car

	those blackguards are at it again 

  a hold-up the word thrilled upon
dicks ear like that of  tiger to the
hunter of big game after all the
camera-fiend is but another edition of the
rampant sportsman

  he never thought of the possible
danger lie simply realized that here
was a chance for a snap shot which would
make him the envy of all his profession
and that by sheer luck he had everything
ready to take it

  thrusting an elbow through the guard-
rail and with the camera and fixings in
his hands lie swung out around the side
of the car and peered eagerly ahead

  up in front by the red glow from the
fire-box he could see a shadowy group of
men with aimed rifles evidently holding
colloquy with the engineer while other
sinister forms were hurrying back toward
the coaches

  just an instant he hesitated in order
to decide upon his focus then snap he
pulled his trigger and the report banged
out like a young cannon while the flash
lit up the rocky walls of the cut with ail
effulgence like noonday

  in the glare lie could see the bandits
standing as men turned suddenly to
stone blinded uncomprehending com-
pletely taken aback

  part of them indeed must have re-
garded it as a supernatural manifesta-
tion  for when he pulled the flash again
he could see that some had fallen to their
knees and others were groveling with
their faces to the ground

   skiddoo  a harsh voice of com-
mand barked from somewhere back of
the right of way  tull your freight
fools cant you see theyre ready for
us 

  behan turned quickly to the direction
from which the order came and exploded
another chargc of magnesium but the


the arcosy

flash was a poor one and all he could
make out was a con fused impression of
fleeing men scrambling up the side of the
cliff

  the attempt proved a disastrous one
to himself too for just as he turned
the engineer recognizing that he was no
longer under duress shot his hand for-
ward to the throttle and the train leaped
out with a momentum which tore the
photographers arm loose ftoin its hold
and hurled him off the steps and down
the embankment

chapter v

a sunrise mystery

  bkman although not knocked insen-
sible was so confused and dazed by his
tumble that for several minutes after he
landed he could only lie still and blink
stupidly after the tail-lights of the re-
treating train

  his first conscious impression was that
they would undoubtedly return to pick
him up but as the chug-chug of the
engine drew more and more rapidly away
into the distance he was forced to an
understanding that such was in nowise
their intention

   the cowardly whelps i  lie muttered
resentfully they are afraid to come
back and are willing to desert me in
order to save their own skins they must
know of my accident of course they
know of it for daffodil would have in-
stantly given the alarm it is simply
that they arc a set of infernal curs 

  nor was his righteous wrath unjusti-
fied for his surmise as to the girls action
was exactly correct as she saw him fall
she had staggered back with a quick gasp
of horror then with ready presence of
mind had dashed inside the car and
mlttd the bell rope

  but the engineer filled with panic
was paying no heed to signals just then
all he thought of was to put as many
miles as possible between himself and
those grim rifle-muzzlcs which had been
poked so threateningly into his face

  neither was the conductor the courte-
ous and complaisant gentleman he had
hitherto shown himself to daffodil

   take your hand off that bell-rope 
he ordered fiercely as lie chargcd in at

the forward door of the car  this train
doesnt stop anywhere between here and
vcrdce  

   but you must stop i  she appealed to
him agonizedly  a passenger fell off
when we started up it was mr behave
the gentleman who was back there with
me  

  the conductor hesitated just a minute
then his fears made him reckless

   i dont care he declared stubborn-
ly  i wouldnt run this train back now
if the czar of all the russias had tum-
bled off ive got one hundrrd and fifty
thousand dollars in currency up in the
express car and the company would
never forgive me if i risked that for the
sake of a careless passenger

   but he saved it for you in the first
place pleaded daffodil it was his
setting off the flash which frightened the
train-robbers and drove them off just
think they may return and finding him
injured wreak vengeance upon him for
what he did

   very likely they hnve him already
retorted the conductor unfeelingly so
i dont see where its going to do nny
good to let them get us too no the
only thing to do is to get to verdee as
quickly as possible and report the matter
to the authorities theyll send out and
rescue him if theres any chance of it
being done

  and for all her prayers and protests
her stinging contcmpt and passionate en-
treaties that was the most which daffodil
could extort from him a promise that
assistance should be despatched ns soon
as they readied vcrdce

  with a sob at her utter helplessness
she had at iasi to sink into her seat and
in an almost frenzied impatience count
the moments as the train seemed to her to
crawl onward although really urged to
its utmost endeavors up the mountain
toward their destination

  a realization of the trainmens atti-
tude however coupled with his natural
indignation at such conduct was in a
wav a good thing for behan for by
making him recogftize that he was now
dependent solely upon his own resources
it acted as a stimulus to restore his scat-
tered faculties

  struggling up on one elbow he began
to take an inventory of his injuries and
an elusive legacy



soon discovered to his satisfaction that
they consisted chiefly of a scratched
shoulder and a badly torn pair of trou-
sers

  even the camera had emerged undam-
aged for lie had not relinquished his
hold upon it as he fell  and since he had
landed upon his back and side sliding
rather than rolling down the bank it had
almost as by a miracle escaped w reek age

  so much being settled the next ques-
tion was what now to do

  the possibility that the train robbers
might return and vent their spite upon
him did naturally suggest itself but only
for a moment me knew that gentry of
that sort usually have their rendezvous
a considerable distance away from the
scenc of their operations and he was
satisfied that this particular band from
the way they had swarmed out of the cut
were now hastening to cover with all
speed

  they would have descended upon him
at once if they had seen him fall and
since they had not done so it was con-
sequently clear that they had failed to
witness his misadventure and in all
probability were no longer in the neigh-
borhood

  no to his reawakening mind his most
distinct cause for disquietude lay in a
very different direction lie could not
fail to foresee that through daffodils in-
sistence if from no other motive the
railroad company would immediately
send out a party to his relief and he
had  desire for the prominence which
such an entry into verdee must neces-
sarily entail upon him

  obliged to tell his story and all about
himself to a host of inquisitive officials
he would be ft marked man and it would
then be as hopeless for him to prosecute
the investigation which had brought him
westward as if he should advertise his
purpose in letters a foot long

   oh he groaned in his chagrin
 what a mess  have made of it what
an infernal mess and all because i
couldnt resist the temptation to snap-
shot a few miserable rood-agents 

  suddenly however a brilliant inspira-
tion carnc to him he remembered that
he had in his pocket a detailed map of
the region thereabout employed for ad-
vertising purposes by colonel jones in
 a

connection with his stock-selling oper-
ations

  dick had clipped this from ft news-
paper the night before he left ravens-
wood with the idea that it might possibly
be of use to him in his examination of the
mine but now ail entirely different way
struck him for turning it to account

  might it not be he questioned that
with this aid he could puzzle out some
other plan of reaching verdee than in
the undesired clutches of a rescuc party

  spreading out the chart upon his knee
anti with the aid of a dozen or so matches
he managed at last to make out where he
was and then he could hardly restrain
the shout of triumph which sprang to his
lips

  for although the railroad curved in a
wide circuit of nearly forty miles around
the mountain in order to reach verdee
his map showed him that as the crow flies
lie was not more than twelve miles distant
and that moreover a short climb up from
the cut and back through the woods
would bring him to a bridle-trail leading
directly to the town

  almost instantly he was up on his feet
and ready to start but first he rc-i
fleeted he must arrange some plan to
allay miss prentices anxiety and set her
mind at rest

  tearing a leaf from his note-book ac-
cordingly he hastily scribbled

 to tub orricials ar tmk railroad

     company

   have had enough of the wild and
  woolly west and am starting back
  afoot for red dog where i shall take
  the first train east please express my
  grip and other personal belongings on
  the car to st paul	deiiavr

   there he muttered as he thrust the
communication into the clcft of a forked
stick and propped it up beside the track
 that will be enough to assure her that

i	have suffered no great hurt and will
also throw the railroad people and au-
thorities off the track sufficiently long for
me to get in my innings

  then without further delay he gath-
ered up his camera and clambering out
of the cut struck off through the woods

  itis progress at first was slow and cau-
tious for he had no wish to get lost in
this unknown country and then too he


the argosy

was not free from certain lingering ap-
prehensions that the train robbers might
still be in the vicinity

  by a stroke of luck however as he
guided his uncertain course with the
little pocket-compass on his watch-chain
he chanced to stumble on the trampled
spot where the bandits had picketed l heir
horses and from this their line of flight
led him through the more or less broken-
down underbrush out to the trail

  even there though his difficulties
were far from over a man familiar
with the country could have reached ver-
dee no doubt in a couple of hours but
behan was a stranger seeking his way in
the dark and obliged to study out every
foot of his road with map and compass

    a trail i  he groaned more than once
as he stumbled over huge logs or floun-
dered knee-deep in quagmires  i won-
der what these people would call a by-
path  

  he lost himself more thnn oncc too
and had to wander around in the dark
fearful every moment lest he stumble
into some unsuspected pitfall or risk an
encounter with a predatory grizzly or
mountainlion

  nevertheless all things must comc to
an end in some way or another and
eventually he reached the edge of a hill-
side from which he could see down below
him in the gray dawn the chimneys of a
smelter while a mile or so off to the
left appeared a cluster of houses which
he rightly took to be verdec

  as he sat down to rest watching the
rosy glow of morning flash from peak to
peak and the whole east become suffused
with a glory of orange and gold and crim-
son he realized that there was an activity
of some kind in progress at the smelter

	is curiosity aroused he bent forward
eagerly to peer in that direction

  the distance was too great however
and he was about to give over the at
tempt when he suddenly lethought him
of the tele-photo lens in his camcra-cnse
ah that little long-distance annihilator
would solve the difficulty

  hastily screwing it into place and
holding the camera in front of his muf-
fled head like an opera-glass he had no
trouble in making out upon the ground-
glass screen exactly what was taking
place

  from the big dump-heaps of ore beside
the smelter a half dozen men were busily
engaged in shoveling the stuff into cars
which when full received a starting push
and then traveled by gravity down a little
track a short way into a wooded ravine
where they were lost to view

   this struck behan as a bit peculiar for
he had always supposed that ore brought
to the smelter remained there to be
treated but he was too ignorant of
mining operations to bccomc suspicious
had it not been that just as he was about
to give over his inspection a young man
evidently in authority came riding up
and pointing toward the sky gave a quick
order

  instantly the shoveling was discontin-
ued the cars pushed as they were into
the ravine and the track leading down to
it-rails sleepers and all-was taken up
by the men and carried in after them in
ten minutes time there was no more sign
of a railroad running away from the
smelter than if it had never existed

   well gasped the astonished dick
 there is a transformation scene for you
that has got kiralfy heal to a standstill
it may be all right of course- i am not
enough of an expert to say-but speak-
ing as a mere greenhorn i have an idea
that my investigation has struck pay-dirt
first dash out of the box

  then partly because he did not wish
to appear in verdec until he had had a
chance to explore that wooded ravine
and partly because he was dog-tired and
worn out by his adventures he curled
himself up under a convenient bush and
went to sleep

chapter vi

 the trackkk  hack id

  whrn behan awoke the sun was well
up in the heavens and a glancc at his
watch showed him that it was after ten
oclock

   lie was stiff and sore as a result of his
nights exertions but he knew that the
best cure for this was a little wholesome
activity so he forced the sluggish flesh 
into submission and after he had per
formed his toilet at a neighboring brook
with his watch-case for a mirror his
handkerchief for a towel and his
an elusive legacy

c

fingers for a comb was surprised lo find
how really fit he did feel

   its this mountain air i suppose
he ruminated  and jove what an
appetite it does give a chap hy the way
 wont do a thing to the first eating-joint
i strike hut before that  must attend
to business

  and with a self-restraint worthy of a
spartan he drew up his belt a couple of
holes and turned his fare away from the
tempting flesh pots of vcrdce toward the
mysterious ravine

  nor did the investigation of this prove
any light task in the first place he had
to make a wide ditour down the moun-
tainside to get to it in order to avoid
observation from the smelter and after
he got close by he felt it further incum-
bent upon him to get down on his
stomach and wriggle through a dense and
mosquito-ridden underbrush

  these latter precautionary measures
were undertaken in deference to llifl
recollection of certain exploits in the
 yellow-back literature of his youth
and he persisted manfully at them until
he had reached the ravine and found out
what he wanted but when it came to
leaving in the same fashion his spirit re-
lolled

   theres evidently nobody on watch
around here he grumbled  whats the
use of my going through all this tom-
foolery a second time and being stung to
death by those pesky gnats merely in
order to pretend  am doing something
venturesome 

  thus it was that a somnolent moun-
taineer reclining behind some bushes on
a farther slope chanced a few minutes
later to have his attention attracted by
an unwonted commotion among the sap-
lings at the head of the ravine and con-
tinuing to stare earnestly in that direction
was presently rewarded by seeing behan
come skulking out of the woods and take
the trail toward town

  there was a shorter cut from where
the mountaineer lay to the trail inter-
cepting it close by the smelter so dick
had not long passed that point before
the other was practically upon his heels

  the fellow seemed so unconcerned
however so utterly bucolic that the pho-
tographer never for a moment thought
of suspecting him and quite at ease

proceeded on his way until he reached
the village and the palace hotel

  five or ten minutes later the moun-
taineer likewise strolled into the office of
that hostelry which was also the bar and
jerking his head in greeting to the pro-
prietor inquired nonchalantly

   takin to feedin tramps now jack
i seen one jest come in

   me aint no tramp indignantly pro-
tested the proprietor  guess you aint
on to the latest fashionable wrinkles down
east lank rake that air gent is on a
walkin tower fcr the benefit of his health
an in order to cnjy the scenery

   jest so seoflingly  i seen a bunch
of the same kind ahoofin it down the rail-
road track yesterday-fer the benefit of
their health an in order to enjy the
scenery gosh jack i thought youd
been too long in the business to have a
hobo trick like that turned on you the
fellers simply playin to beat you out of
his grub an a shack fer the night

  the other raised his eyebrows in sur
percilious disdain

  no need to strain yerself to look out
fer my welfare lank he observed
dryly   aint a savin but what looks
may be agin the young feller him havin
lost the trail an got mixed up with some
scrub-oak a coinin across the mounting
but as it happens them four-flush sur-
mises of yourn is beat by these four
deuces opening his ensh-drawer to show
four two-dollar bills  which said stran-
ger hands over to me in liquidation of his
board an keep hoboes so fur as my
observation goes aint in the habit of
payin in advance fer the best room in my
house nor of demandin a bath which at
present is heatin fcr mr behan in the
bilcr on the kitchen stove

  even the mountaineers skepticism had
to give way before such an accumulation
of evidence he covered his defeat by
motioning with his head toward one of
the bottles behind the bar and as he
filled his glass repeating questioninglv
 mr behan

  yesvmr richard behan of new
york city pushing forward a dog-eared
register which lay at one end of the
counter thar it is and the landlord
pointed out dicks hastily scribbled sig-
nature   an here it is agin on a telly-
gram which he give me to send pro-


the argosy

lucing a folded-up slip of paper from
tlit cash-drawcr

  ionk rnkc inspected the message cu-
riously

  say jack he offered  ef itd bo
anything of a accommodation to yer ill
take that down to the station fer yer im
a headin that way right now on i kin
do it jest as well as not

  the hotel man looked a little surprised
since the other was not usually of such
an obliging disposition still busy as he
was looking after the comfort of the new
arrival he was not inclined to question
motives too narrowly and therefore hand-
ed over the telegram without comment

  an by the way i jink he added
 ef youre goin to the station anyhow
sposin you look after this stranger
trunk will yer an git it up here fer him
he shipped it on ahead lie says  so i low
youll find it a layin on the platform
heres the check fer it an ill square up
with yer on the job when yer it back
 all right assented the mountaineer
carelessly and shoving the check and
message into his pocket he lurched out
at the door and down the street

  lie had not proceeded more than be-
yond the landlords sight however when
he drew from his pocket the folded paper
and laboriously spelled out its contents
which proved to be as follows

  g wkatiikrdy ravcnswood

    have secured undoubted evidence of
  crooked denlinr and shall lay it before
  prentice at once in order that he may
  take immediate steps to protect myself
  and otlicr stockholders

  whew whistled i-ank rake with
consternation written large upon his face
 i knowed thar was nomepn wrong
about him as soon as  seen him come
sneakin outn them bushes but this here
j wussn  thought i guts i dont want
to lose no time huntin up ralph jones
an lettin him know whats up

  to his relief however the object of
his search -colonel joness son and the
manager of the verdee mines in his
fathers absence-swung into sight at
that very moment cantering up the road
on horseback with a young lady at his
side

  still for all his expressed desire rake

  made no attempt to intercept the other or
hail him indeed he did not even glance
in that direction but as he slouched up
the street he pulled three times at the
ragged hat-brim above his brow and the
young horseman a quick glint coming
into his eye slapped his gaitered calf
three times lightly with his riding-stock

chapter vii

daffodil gets a pointer

  dick behan perhaps saw the covert
signal exchanged between the mining
superintendent and his henchman for
his attention drawn by the clatter of
hoofs he had looked out from behind his
flimsy window-curtain just as the couple
on horseback swept by the hotel

  but though lie may have seen he of
course attached no significance to the
action and anyway his eyes were all
engaged with the girl rather than with
the mountaineer or young jones

  the latter he may have noted indeed
as a dark heavy-browed chap rather
good-looking except for a forbidding
twist to his mouth  but the girl was daf-
fodil and never had he imagined such
a picturc of gracc and dash and beauty
ns she made in the saddle

  her face glowing with the exercise
under the di vernon hat she wore with
its long sweeping plumes her slender
figure becomingly set forth in her trim
riding habit her eyes sparkling with ani-
mation and her perfect poise upon her
mount not only made an entrancing
vision but also betokened that she pos-
sessed a mind absolved from care

  yet somehow the siht of her did not
seem altogether enrapturing to the unseen
watcher behind the window-curtain he
drew bnck with an unmistakable frown
upon his face and muttered sulkily

   doesnt seem to be grieving very hard
over my departure does she at any
rate it looks a though she were able to
console herself pretty quick

  but in this he did miss prentice a
marked injustice for she had passed a
most anxious and miserable time blaming
herself in some illogical fashion for the
mishap which had overtaken her compan-
ion on the train her present gaiety and
high spirits were entirely due to the fact
an klusive legacy



  that she had just been to the station inti
heard of the finding of bohan note with
its naturnl inference that nil wns well with
him

   such a relief as it is she was saying
at that very moment to jones  for 
felt in a way responsible dont you know
and if he had fallen into the hands of
those awful train-roliers i should never
have forgiven myself

   those awful traln-robbers will prob-
ably never forgive themselves that he
didnt fall into their hands when they had
such an easy chance at him retorted her
cavalier sententiously  on the whole
although it doesnt seem a highly valiant
action i guess he has done the wisest
thing in heading back east that gang
would have got even with him sure if he
had lingered long around these diggings

   but that is just what i cannot under-
stand she said with a touch of per-
plexity  mr behave never struck me
at all ns the kind of a man who could be
easily frightened off from any purpose he
had in view i cannot believe but that
he had some stronger reason to turn back
than merely because he was afraid of
these bandits

  young jones bent his brows upon her
in sudden inquiry

   you have known him a long time i
believe you said

  she had the grace to falter a second

  yes oh yes wc were childhood
playmates with a slightly heightened
color

   at ravenswood  

  she gave a little startled gasp for the
abrupt question had cleared up for her
that puzzling familiarity of hehaves ap-
pearance which had struck her more than
once during the westward journey

  as with a flash of recollection she re-
membered now that this was the man she
had eon with weatherby on the morning
that she took the train from home

  her momentary flutter she disguised
admirably however under pretense of
having some trouble with her stirrup and
this adjusted she turned again to her
companion

   you were asking if it were at ra-
venswood that i knew mr behave she
said collectedly enough  no although
i have seen him there upon occasion  but
it was at quite another place that i met

  him and an involuntary smile rippled
over her lips at the thought of the ficti-
tious  anyoldtown

  jones rode on in silcnce for a second or
two then he asked sharply

   you spoke of him just now as a man
not apt to be easily turned aside from ills
purpose what was the purpose which
was bringing him to verdec

   why i dont know what gener-
ally brings men out here to look at
mines i suppose or else for sport

  just so but this bchavo isnt a
sportsman is he 

   no i think not at least he had 
guns or any of that sort of paraphernalia
with him- that is unless you count his
camera

  but the superintendent impatiently
brushed this last suggestion aside

   then it was mines which brought
him he muttered half to himself he
turned to the girl again  is lie a stock-
holder in venice he demanded searcli-
ingly

   how should i know drawing her-
self back a little haughtily

  she was ljcginning to be resentful of
this continued cross-examination

   but you arc such old friends
i should have thought he might have
mentioned it knowing that your father
was also interested in the property

   even old friends may have certain
reticences if he didnt carc to speak
of it there is no reason why lie should
have done so

   ah then you believe that he is in-
terested in verdee but for sonic reason
didnt want you to know it

i believe nothing of the sort nor did

i	intend to give any such impression
itow can you twist my words around
so

   t am not twisting your words the
other growled with a surly attempt at
apology  i am simply trying to find
out what was this fellows errand  and
if i am not mistaken its what i sus-
pected from the first lies a spy

  a spy she repeated her eyes
widening  but how could that be
isnt the mine open to inspection to those
interested in it 

  it was joness turn now to redden and
show confusion

 yes he stammered  provided they


the argosy

let us know when to expect them we
object though to a lot of tenderfoots
prowling around and drawing their own
conclusions

   and whats more he added with a
vicious snap of his teeth  wc wont have
it 

chapter viii

  a committer on entertainment

  realizing from daffodils face that
he was perhaps speaking with more vehe-
mence than discretion jones broke off
rather shortly

  oh well he said with an attempt
at a laugh  whats the use of getting
ones self stirred up over nothing be-
have whatever his mission may have
been has gone back home and theres an
end to the matter

  and with that he began pointing out
to his companion the objects of interest
in the surrounding landscape and so con-
tinued until they had reached her own
gate where after he had assisted her to
dismount lie excused himself on the
score of business and rode smartly away

  miss prentice did not immediately go
into the house but stood gazing after his
retreating figure a light as of rebellion
in her eyes

  a girl is not without some comprehen-
sion of what is in the wind when after
receiving numerous letters extolling the
merits of a certain young man she is in-
vited by her father to come half-way
across the continent to a lonely mining-
camp where the young man aforesaid is
the only marriageable male in the place

  nor were there any doubts in her mind
ince her arrival as to the readiness of
mr ralph jones to fall in with the pro-
gram arranged

  lie had been at the train with her
father to meet her the night before anti
this morning he had appeared bright and
early to act as her escort showing by
every word and action that he already
considered himself her natural protector
and associate

  no daffodil could not well cherish
any illusions as to what was expected of
her  and if her expression could be ta-
ken as any guide she was already in re
volt against the plan

  it was not that she had taken particu-
lar exception to anything the fellow had
said or done his quizzing manner to
ward her as of a lawyer with a refractory
witness she could pardon remembering
that he was used to dealing otdy with
men

  it was rather that her feminine sixth
sense upon which women chiefly rely
warned her to distrust this man just as
the same intuitive guide had told her that
she might freely trust and confide in dick
behan

  yet the one was vouched for by her
father and was open and aboveboard in
all his relations with her while she
could not blind her eyes to the fact that
the other had enveloped himself in mys-
tery and that as lone had intimated his
mission might well be hostile to the pres-
ent management of the vcrdcc mines

  indeed she could hardly doubt that
such was the case remembering that she
had first seen her late traveling com-
panion upon the ravenwood platform
in close conference with her fathers in-
veterate enemy g weatherby

   yes she told herself  i suppose
there can be no question but that his
purpose was to play the spy and do us
harm

  then as the recollection came to her
of ralph joness face when in discuss-
ing the possibility of any ones attempt-
ing to investigate the mine lie had pas-
sionately declared  wc wont have it
a little fluttering sigh of relief escaped
her lips

   oh i am glad glad she breathed
 that whatever his reason may have
been he decided to turn back

  she might however have felt less
cause for thanksgiving had she known
of the conversation which was at that
moment taking place between the mining
superintendent and the man who had
exchanged the mysterious signals with
him near the palace hotel

  riding away from her jones had pro-
ceeded to a secluded spot a little way off
the trail leading from the village to the
mines and there waited impatiently until
the mountaineer hove into view

   well hedemandcd sharply  whats
up now that youre off post and so crazy
to see me some boys been snooping
around over by the ravine again eh
an elusive legacy



  no boss aint no boys this time
but a full-growcd man an a stranger at
that

  a stranger with an unmistakable
start

    yep a feller that looks like a sure-
enough hobo hut whats down to the
palace hotel now an has give up eight
dollars fer his board an keep jack
avery says hes a tenderfoot on a walkin
tower through the mountings hut ef
thats so what was he doin half a mile
oflfn the trail down at the mouth of the
ravine i didnt see him go in there
but i seen him comc out an hr sure did
have a sneaky look to him

    hm young jones frowned  still
he admitted  it may be all right a pe-
destrian not knowing the country might
easily tray off down there and if he was
a tenderfoot not recognize that there
was anything doing

   yes but how about this  queried
lank rake producing dicks telegram
with a flourish and handing it over

  the superintendent ran his eye quick-
ly through the message his brow darken-
ing with a malevolent scowl

   richard behan  he exclaimed as
he came to the signature  why that
is the chap father wired me to look out
for and take carc of when he should ar
rive but who would ever have expected
him to come ill across the trail

   he must have smelled a mouse and
dropped off the train at red dog but
to do it without a guide and-

    i la  with a sudden thought  this
is  behave not  behan the telegraph
operator got it wrong in fathers mes
sage jut as we got it wrong here this
is none other than the duck who stopped
the hold-up last night and who left the
plausible note saying he had hot-footed
it back east

   and now he has  undoubted evi-
dence of crooked dealing eh glancing
once more at the telegram  and is

	going to lay it before prentice  

  well and joness white teeth
showed in a sinister smile  i dont think
he will not immediately at any rate
what are you goin to do qucs
tinned lank rake  send a couple of
the boys up to the hotel to kidnap him
like we did that other short-horn that
come pesterin round

   i kin do it slick as a whistle he
added eagerly  ive got the job of
deliverin his trunk from avery an ef i
take one of the gang with me wc kin
grab him an git away with him afore he
over suspicions that thar is anything up

  jones thoughtfully stroked his chin a
he considered the proposition

    no he decided at length  too risky
you know how hard it was to convince
avery on that other deal and i doubt if
we could pull the wool over his eyes a
second time

   besides you forget that i am a
deputy sheriff now pulling back his
lapel with a mocking grin to show the
little silver badge upon its under side
 responsible for the maintenance of law
and order in this community

  lank rake stared at his companion
frankly puzzled  yer dont mean that
yer goin to let this maverick heller what
hes found out all over the range 

   oh no well muzzle him all right
but well muzzle him in such a way that
therell be no inconvenient questions
asked this deal is going to be played
strictly according to hoyle listen

  and then lowering his voice he out-
lined in a few crisp sentences the plan
wnich had suggested itself to him

  lank rake stood listening and as the
others purpose became clear nodded his
head from time to time in approval

   good he ejaculated at length em-
phasizing his commendation with a
copious expectoration of tobacco-juice
 im to have two men stationed on every
trail leadin out of town an six scattered
along the railroad track while you an
me-

   you and i lank grinned jones
 will see that due attention is paid to
the distinguished stranger within our
gates wc will be the committee on
entertainment i 

chapter ix

all unsuspicious

   how soon will my trunk be along
inquired behan after he had done full
justice to the dinner provided by the
palace hotel

  the landlord thoughtfully calculated
upon the amount of procrastination to be


the argosy

expected from lank rake and answered
with discretion

   not much afore four oclock taint
likely now he said  i sent a man
right down to the station for it hut
seems he aint showed up sense i low
hes waitin to see whether it dont come
in on the 

   but good heavens fumed dick
 that throws me clear out i have a
very important call to make this after-
noon and i cant go in this rig

  the landlords eyes wandered apprais-
ingly over his guests torn jind mud-
stained attire

   well i dont know he rejoined
 ycr see wc dont go in so heavy fer
full dress as you folks does on east
who was it you was calelatin on vis-
itin ef i might ask

  mr prentice returned dick and
i hardly think-

  hut the landlord interrupted to inform
him that if such was the case it made no
difference anyhow since prentice had
gone out that morning with the posse in
pursuit of the train robbers and could
not well be expected back before the fol-
lowing day

   ycr see he explained  thars been
several of these here hold-ups an all r
em has been when money was aboard fer
the verdec mining company conse
kently ive heard that prentice is a bit
sore cause nobody aint been kctchcd yet
an  guess he went along himself this
time sos to make sure thar wasnt no
shenanigan business about it

   howsomcver he added  ef its the
verdec people yer want to see ralph
jones is in town an he could probly
tell ycr anything yer want to know

   ralph jones who is he

   the superintendent

   any relation to colonel jones

   only his son an  guess with a
willingness to gossip  likely to ockerpy
a similar sltooation with yer friend pren-
tice leastways he aint losin no time
with the darter which come on last night
they say hes been with her almost eve-
ry minute since she arriv

  dick pushed back his chair from the
table with a totally unnecessary amount
of force

   no he said hastily  no i have
no business with mr jones tell them

to bring up my trunk as soon as it comes
will you  he added as hr started for ills
room  ill put in the time until then
developing the pictures  have taken on
the road

  accordingly on reaching his chamber
he straightened out the development kit
which was a part of his photographic out-
fit and removing the roll of films from
his camera proceeded to get busy

  to his regret he found that the flash-
lights he had taken of the hold-up were
failures owing probably to his nervous-
ness at the moment but certainly no such
fault was to be seen in the collection of
snap-shots depicting miss prentice

  recalled by the sight of them to the
many happy hours he had spent with her
on the train dick grew more sore than
ever over the quickness with which she
seemed to have forgotten him

   his first impulse in his jealous resent-
ment was to destroy the whole set of neg-
atives  but upon consideration he re-
frained

   no he said   will keep them just
to remind me what fool dreams a fellow
can build up and to prevent me from
ever thinking again that theres reliance
to be put in any woman

  this was very silly of course  but the
young man in love has never been credit-
ed with any great degree of sanity and
those smiles which he had seen daffodil
lavishing upon her escort rankled deep
in poor dicks bosom

  yet since he had made up his mind to
preserve the pictures he went about it in
no slipshod fashion every film was
painstakingly developed and as the aft-
ernoon was bright and clear and he had
plenty of sensitized paper in his kit he
resolved to lose no time in taking off the
prints but to finish up the job and be
done with it

  thus at last he came to the final neg-
ative the one he had snapped that morn-
ing through the tele-photo lens and as
lie held it up to the light he was struck
by its excellence as a photograph

  every detail was clear anti distinct-
much more so indeed than the image
of the scene as it had been manifested
upoti his ground-glass screen

   here lie could plainly see the smelter
with its chimneys and orc-heaps the cars
and sidings the workmen busily engaged
an elusive legacy

g

in tearing up the mysterious extension of
the rahroad and packing it off down into
the ravine and finally the young man in
authority who-

  behan gave a quick exclamation and
bent lower to scrutinize the pictured fare

  yes there could be no doubt about it
this was the fellow lie had seen ride past
the hotel that morning with daffodil
prentice and who from the landlords
chatter he realized could he none other
than ralph jones the superintendent of
the vcrdce mine

  but even as he stood there with the
thing in his hand lie heard sounds out in
the hall betokening the arrival of his be-
lated trunk so hastily fastening down
the picture with the last of the daffodil
film over a sheet of sensitized paper lie
left it upon the window-sill and turned
to fling open the door

  grunting and sweating under their
burden lank rake and a companion
bore in the trunk and dumped it heavily
on the floor

   careful there i careful  cautioned
dick springing forward  i have my
big camera inside and a lot of chem-
icals  

   might have a elephant from the heft
of it growled the mountaineer wiping
the perspiration from his brow  i
didnt know when i made the dicker with
jack avery that i was bargainin to move
a house gosh mr behave thats a
reglar noahs ark t

  behave ejaculated dick sur-
prised at the use of his sobriquet

  yep thats yer name aint it
nothin to be ashamed of in it either ef
what they say you done last night is
true

  behan did not take the trouble to deny
or explain after all what difference
did it make now since the purpose of
his trip was practically accomplished
there was really no longer any reason for
subterfuge

  therefore merely supposing that his
identity had become known through the
recognition of some one who had been on
the train and desiring to get rid of the
men as quickly as possible in order that
jie might open his trunk and alaume
more respectable apparel he let the state-
ment pass unchallenged

  rake and his partner stumped out and

dick- busied himself emptying his trunk
and transferring its contents to the large
closet at one side of the room

  then he selected fresh linen and a
neat business suit from the stock at hand
and having donned these and taken a
shave began to feel once more like a
civilized being

  meanwhile the afternoon had waned
far down in that valley under the shadow
of the towering mountains sunset came
early indeed dicks toilet was hardly
concluded when the last farewell ray was
flashed over the western peaks and dusk
fell upon the little village

  c stepped toward the door intending
to call for a light but even as he did so
there came a knock and the landlord ap-
peared upon the threshold

   mr behave lie said with marked
deference  thars a party of gents down
in the barroom that would like to have
the pleasure of yer compny ef you kin
make it convenient

chapter x

puii your freight i

  wondering at the summons and not
understanding what could possibly be

wanted of him dick nevertheless fol-
lowed the landlord down stairs

  his perplexity was relieved however
when the door was thrown open into the
bar for a crowd which completely filled
the low-ceiled smoky room raised a cry
of greeting and a big red-shirted miner
sprang forward to grasp him by the
hand

   gents said this self-constituted
master of ceremonies drawing dick into
the center of the floor  heres the gam cat
thing that ever came down the pike this
is the boy weve all lecn talkin about
what stood off a gang of road agents
with nothin in his hands vcptn a dinky
little pictur machine give him three
cheers to let him know what- we think
of him 

   yee-owl yelled the crowd with en-
thusiasm and  yee-ow   and  yee-
ow  again until it almost seemed as
though the roof would be raised with the
noisy outburst

  a dozen hands were stretched out to
seize behans lie was almost staggered


the argosy

by the applauding slaps laid upon ins
shoulder

  modestly he tried to disclaim nny es-
pecial merit for his deed and to ascribe
it all to accident but hi admirers would
listen to no such explanations

  they were determined to exalt him
into a hero and willy-nilly lie had to
mount the pedestal

  over and over again he was called on
to describe the routing of the bandits and
with each recital especially as the bar
was doing a rushing business their ap-
proval of his conduct became more pro-
nounced their shouts of laughter nt the
discomfiture of the gang more uproar-
ious

  nothing in verdee they assured him
was too good for such a man as he he
had but to express a wish and they
would see that it was instantly attended
to

  in fact as the fiery liquor dispensed
by jack avery took deeper effect upon
them dick began to find their attentions
rather overpowering and was consider-
ing how best he might excuse himself and
withdraw from the boisterous scene when
there came an interruption in the shape of
a new arrival

  the door was roughly flung open and
into the assemblage strode ralph jones

   here here avery he demanded
arrogantly  what is the meaning of all
this you fellows arc making enough
noise to wake the dead what is it all
about 

  a score of voices tried to answer him
but the red-shirted master of ceremonies
awaking to the duties of his position
stilled them with a wave of his arm and
staggered forward

   why shouldnt wc make a noise he
hicrupcd  when weve got the bravest
little man with us that ever hit the town
-a feller that stood off a whole gang of
road-agents with nothin but a pictur
machine thar mr jones pointing
an unsteady fmger at dick  thar stands
ltehavc 

   behave ralph jones gave a well-
assumed start then he turned con-
temptuously toward the other  what
arc you trying to give me he sneered

  but it is it is behave came from
every quarter of the room  hes been
tellin us all about it

  the mining superintendent laughed in
scorn  behave  he repeated then
hes a very different looking man from
the one described to me by miss pren-
tice

   and besides with the flourish of a
clinching argument as he produced the
misleading note left by dick at the scene
of the hold-up  here is a message un-
doubtedly from behave in which lie dis-
tinctly states that he has started back
east if that be so what is he doing
here in verdee

  the crowd sobered for the moment
gazed uncertainly from one man to the
other and jones relying upon the ad-
vantage he had gained swaggered up to
behan

   is your name behave he demand-
ed

  the whole affair had come so quickly
upon dick that he was dazed confused

  he realized that ns a stranger there
with no one to plead his cause he must
make no false step and stopped to con-
sider his answer but this very hesita-
tion told against him

 is your name behave every
voice in the room was thundering the
question at him now

   no he faltered but- 

 his attempted explanation was
drowned in the roar of yells cat-calls
and hisses which greeted so fatal an ad-
mission

  indeed he would probably have re-
ceived a good deal rougher treatment
had not jack avery leaped from behind
the counter and hustling his guest into a
corner stood before him in defensive at-
titude with a huge bung-startcr in his
hands

   no rough-house gents protested
the proprietor  outside you kin do what
you please but while hes under my roof
no one shall lay a finger on him ralph
jones youre dcppity sheriff  i call on
you to help me protect this here man

  jones still with that disdainful smile
upon his lips pushed his way to averys
side

  but who is he jack lie ques-
tional  where did lie come from

the crowd took it upon himself to an-

been him when he come in thin morning
 hoofin it over the trail

  a hoho eh how about it avery

i	didnt know you had gone into the busi-
ness of harboring tramps	

   nor  aint neither protested
avery with ft vehement shake of the
head  i aint a denyin that the gent
here looked pretty seedy when he come
but what with him a payin in advance
an a tollin me that he was on a walkin
tower i-

  but the rest of averys excuse was
lost in a storm of derisive laughter and
joness lip curled

    pshaw  he exclaimed  its as plain
as the nose on ones face the man is
simply a faker who thought he could
reap ft harvest by coming here and palm-
ing himself off as a hero

   but the eight dollars he paid me
broke in avery  that dont look
much like a hobo

   oh that was only to make his game
good and strong most of these fellows
have some cash stowed away that they
can draw on in ease necessity arises lies
a tramp i tell you just a common
tramp 

   if you would otdy let me explain
urged dick striving to make himself
heard above the babel of voices  i
think-

  ijut avery turned on him with a
silencing scowl

   shut up you fool he muttered
 less heard from you right now the
better theyre gittin mad clean
through an ef you happen to rile em
up any more theyre liable to go after
you blood-raw	

  indeed the justicc of this warning
was plain from the fact that several
menacing rushes had already been made
toward the rnrncr as though to seize
upon the prisoner these had only been
stayed by the determined manner in
which the landlord brandished his bung-
startor

  the air too was filled with vengeful
cries of lynch him i string him
up tar and feather him ride
him on a rail 

  it was plain that only a leader was
needed to start mischief

  put ralph jones had no intention of
letting matters reach a crisis pushing

avery to one side he himself took a
stand in front of behan

   stand back there boys he ordered
turning his lapel and flashing his badge
at them  the law requires me to pre-
vent violence and protect even such ver-
min as this

  he paused a second while his eyes
sought lank rakes with the question
 is everything ready then at a reas-
suring nod from his subordinate he con-
tinued 

   it goes against mgrain but in the
position i hold i cant stand for any-
thing different seeing that i am here
this hobo is going to have fifteen min-
utes to clear after that i am going
home and if any of you get him you
can do what you please i wash my
hands of further responsibility

  seizing dick by the arm he shouldered
a way through the press and thus con-
ducted his charge to the front door

  the crowd made a move as if to fol-
low but jones whirled about on them
with a drawn revolver in either hand

   no you dont  he exclaimed  not
a man leaves this room until the fifteen
minutes is up  

  then he released his hold on behan
and pushed him across the threshold

   skiddoo bo he cried with mock-
ing intonation pull your freight i 

      chapter xl
      hare and hounds

  for a moment dick paused blinking
his eyes in the unlighted darkness of the
village street

  the whole thing seemed unreal to
him fantastic as the topsy-turvy inci-
dents of a nightmare and he half expect-
ed to find himself waking up to the
prosaic surroundings of his new york

bed-chamber

  put as he stood there a fresh burst of
clamor and cursing swept out to him
from the noisy barroom and brought
home to him with stern significance the
reality of his peril

  iti fifteen minutes that drunken law-
less crew blind to reason or to argu-
ment would be turned loose to search
for him and from what he had seen of
their temper he knew it would wo betide


the argosy

him if lie should happen lo fall into their
clutches

  unarmed and alone what chance
would he have against an inflamed and
riotous mob

  no he must get away must follow
the gratuitous advics of ralph jones and
pull his freight and he could lose
no time about doing it either

  hut whither might he flee where
would he find himself safe from pursuit

  he was entirely unacquainted with the
roads leading out of the village except
the one over which he had come in that
morning and now in the darkness all
the landmarks pointing to it were blotted
out and confused

  besides lie reasoned ktiowing of his
familiarity with that route the men
would be most likely to seek him there
and lie remembered that there was no
shelter or hkling-place along it until
one had passed the smelt or

  the railroad track which lie guessed
must be at the lower end of the street
seemed to afford him a better avenue of
escape for there his pursuers must be
thrown at fault by the knowledge that
lie rould have taken either one of two
ways and furthermore there would
probably be station buildings and box
cars on the sidings which would still
further delay them in their search

  ii	is decision was accelerated at this
point by another chorus of yells and im-
precations from the restrained pack in-
side  so without further debate he
started ofif full tilt upon the way he had
chosen-the way toward the railroad
along which lank rakes six men were
posted ready to seize him

  ignorant however of the greater peril
into which he was speeding eager only
to escape the one he knew dick plunged
on stumbling through the darkness

  ho must go now that he knew he
rould not hope to get a hearing to-night
from that befuddled horde in their pres-
ent humor but he promised himself
that lie would not go far and that to-
morrow he would return to exact full
reparation for the indignities which had
been heaped upon him

  strangely enough the chief thing
which aroused his resentment was the
protection which had been extended to
him by ralph jones

   to think that i should he placed
under obligation to that scoundrel he
muttered through set teeth and at the
same time have to endure his gibes and
sneers i am almost certain too from
his manner that he knew the truth was
there ever such malicious relish in a voice
as when he told me to  skiddoo pull
your freight   

   skiddoo i pull your freight it
suddenly struck him that those words
were strangely familiar somewhere be-
fore he had heard them uttered too
in a voice of the same quality although
with a different intonation-an intona-
tion then not of derision but of alarm
and chagrin

  where had he heard them some-
where certainly and that quite recently
lie was willing to swear

  in the vengeful ferment of his
thoughts however his mind did not dwell
long upon the subject but presently was
hammering away again at what he es-
teemed his especial grievance

  to be indebted for my safety to a
crook he raged and to have cut
such a pitiable figure before him too
to-morrow liell probably describe it all
to daffodil with embellishments

   but therell come a day of reckon-
ing its his turn now but wait until i
return and explode the bomb ive got laid
up then well see how he stands the
gaff if i am not mistaken that ugly
grin of his will be on the other side of
his mouth

  meanwhile dick was speeding as fast
as his legs could carry him right into
the trap which his enemy had set

  joness chief aim in the plot which he
had formulated had been of course to
clear his own skirts of any responsibility
for what happened to the stranger in
camp and he therefore had so arranged
matters that in case of any question be-
ing raised he should appear as the law-
abiding official the one person who had
intervened to extend succor

  it cannot be denied however that the
project gained a certain cruel zest to his
mind from its feline and deceptive qual-
ity all the time that he was holding
back the mob and pretending to give the
fugitive a chance he was secrctly exult-
ing in the knowledge that behan strain
his energies as he might was as com-
an elusive legacy



pletely lost to hope as the mouse under
the paw of the rat

  bui sometimes the poor mouse escapes
an overconfident grimalkin and in his
calculations jones had overlooked one
point the point too which seemed on
the face of it dirks worst stumbling
block-his ignorance of the village path-
ways

  so it happened that as bohan fled
pnntingly along the road which he be-
lieved extended to the station but which
really led in quite the contrary direction
he was brought to an inderisive halt by
its sudden forking into three separate
ways

  which should he take lor a mo-
ment he was nonplused then quickly
noting-for by this time his eyes had be-
come somewhat accustomed to the dark
-that the right hand one appeared
to be the more traveled he took it on a
venture

  down it he ran trusting to luck that
lie had made no mistake and charged
full into a barbed wire fence which en-
closed a place of considerable size he
had landed in a nil ir sot-

  ahead of him he could see a white
two story dwelling set well back in a
wide yard full of trees while to the roar
was a barn and the dim outline of several

sheds

  it was as a matter of fact the show
residence of verdee but although behan
did not know this he realized plainly
that it was too big for him to skirt and
that lie must either cross the property or
turn back to the forks

  the first was manifestly risky for it
was evident now that lie had lost his
bearings and to take cither of the other
roads might precipitate him straight into
the arms of his pursuers

  yet was the alternative any loss haz-
ardous crossing a piece of private
property lie could hardly fail to arouse a
watchdog and thus excite an alarm
which would betray his whereabouts and
speedily bring his enemies down upon
him

  hesitating uncertain he stood there
his perplexed gaze meanwhile taking in
unconsciously the details of this house
which had barred his progress

plainly there was a feminine member
to the family for the light from the

open front door showed a fleecy shawl
hanging over the back of one of the
piazza chairs and a dainty work basket
with its spool of embroidery silk rested
on the step

  and then as he waited debating what
next the piano was struck and a rich
clear contralto floated out to him in the
words of a song lie had often heard
hummed by miss prunes and prisms
during that never-to-be-forgotten journey
across the continent

  he gave a great asp of wondering re
lief blind chanrc had solved his di-
lemma aiid led him to the one haven of
refuge open to him in all verdee

  strange as it may seem the hurly-
burly of his thoughts had been such in
his flight that never before had the idea
occurred to him of appealing to mr
prentice for protection

  now as if by magic the hunted ap-
prehensive air of the fugitive dropped
from his shoulders lie straightened up
into quite his ordinary nonchalant man-
ner and opening the rate strode boldly
up the path

  the contralto voire in the cadences of
the familiar song still floated out to him
the fleecy shawl and work-basket spoke
eloquently to him of daffodils presenrc
but lie resolutely closed his eyes and ears
to their appeal

  it was the father not the daughter
that lie wanted to see he told himself
a coquette lie hotly vowed had no at-
traction for him

  no it was on a mnns business lie had
comc and he wished to see only the
master of the house

  but alas the neat maid who answered
his ring at the bell informed him that
mr prentice had not only not relumed
as yet but that a message had been re-
ceived from him stating that he would
not be home before the morrow

  should lie put his pride in his pocket
then and crave sanctuary of the lady-
the lady lie had deemed almost his but
who had shown herself so fickle and in-
constant 

  in his dire need it cannot be denied
that such a course presented a strong
temptation but he angrily fought it
down

   better almost he told himself the ten-
der mercies of the mob than like a
the argosy

craven rcek shelter behind the petticoats
of miss prcnticc

  with an impulsive gesture he turned
away from the portal and heard the
maid close the door behind him

  and as he lingered a second on the

porch the night was suddenly shattered
into fragments by a wild howl from over
toward the renter of the village-a fierce
yelping as of n pack of hounds loosed to
the chase

  the fifteen minutes was up

                            to be continued

that dropped car

                    by robert russell

              how smithm came to have an unpleasant fact broken lo
              him not chily but a it were in iledge-hammer fashion

ie smithcrs had not been so anxious to
make the strongest kind of an im-
pression on the young woman with whom
he was to spend his halfholiday the
thing would never have happened but
the result would probably have been the
same at any rate when grace forest
had said a few days before that he
might accompany her on the train to a
suburban town i short distance outside
the city the young man determined to
make every portion of the trip as pcrfcct
as possible and finally to unbosom him-
self of the great love he persuaded him
self that he felt for her

  her visit war to be a short one in
which he was not to share but he was
confident that the granting of this favor
by such a popular girl meant that she
would not be averse to hearing his pro-
posal

  it was uiu desire to appear to advan-
tage in her eyes that led to the brilliant
idea of spending his last three dollars on
the extravagant luxury of a taxicab to
carry them both to the station their
tickets were safely stowed away in his
pocket he knew that miss forest would
be met at the station by her friends so
that when he was obliged to turn her
over to them she would be in ignorance
of the fact of his folly

  the beauty of the day made the long
ride to the station extremely pleasant to
the young man and her graciousness and
apparent appreciation of his thought for
her comfort added much to his pleasure

   but it was awfully foolish of you to
go to the expense of this taxicab she
remarked

   in ones affairs with some people
nothing is foolish which adds to their
pleasure replied smithcrs with a hid-
den intense meaning

   i have a brother who is just starting
in to practise law for himself miss
forest continued  you see i know
how slowly the fees come in

   but replied smithcrs with becom-
ing modesty  there is a great difference
in the amount of work and consequent
pay that young lawyers make

   at any rate it was very kind of you
to take so much trouble said the girl
 and it certainly is pleasant

   point one smithcrs told himself

  safely aboard the train with the an-
ticipation of their hours tlte-h-tite be-
fore him the young man set himself seri-
ously to work to disclose to the girl his
keen insight into affairs which usually
escaped the ordinary young person lie
had tne story concerning every place of
importance which they passed and he
felt that his remarks were unusually
brilliant and original an abandoned
quarry naturally suggested other indus
trial errors which stupid capitalists had
made and the subject of railroading
came up

  this road for instance remarked
smithcrs  is very poorly managed il
has probably escaped your notice that
this train is composed of two coaches
which are occupied and one that is bare
ly filled to my mind the carrying of
that extra coach is a great waste of
energy now if l were at the head of
this railroad things would be done very

differently
thai dropped car



  and so it was with every subject which
camc up this young man had some im
provement to offer in many cases his
remarks really making an impression
upon the girl

  the train had only covered a small
portion of their journey and was slowing
up at a station when a particularly schol-
arly dissertation by smithers was inter
rupted by the brakeman who shouted in
an unusually plain manner

   passengers will please take the car
ahead

  this bit of idiotic management of
traffic brought forth more criticism from
the young man who grumblingly escort-
ed miss forest into the forward coach
while the one they had just quitted was
cut from the train as a matter of fact
they were obliged to walk through to the
second car ahead before they could ob-
tain seats

  with renewed determination smithers
again set himself to entertain the girl by
his side deciding that a very few mo
ments toward the etui of their journey
would be sufficient to speak of personal
matters he had again reached a most
satisfactory moment in their intercourse
when another interruption occurred

   tickets please came from a digni-
fied conductor

  smithers reached for the little blue
slips which had been inserted in the cush-
ion of the seat in front of them rut no
tickets were there and then he remem-
bered

  when they had moved from the rear
car now probably standing on some side-
track miles behind them he had forgot-
ten to take their tickets with him

   i left them in the other car some
time ago aid smithers with confidence

   sorry sir replied the conductor
 but you must get others where arc
you going

   to charloton replied the young
man losing some of his confidence and
 should not be compelled to buy tickets
twice

   thats the rule said the man in
uniform  of course the road will re-
fund you your money when wc find the
others

   i have had occasion to notice began
smithers seeing nothing to do but bluster
it out  that this road is run in a very

poor manner this is merely an exam-
ple its not the money i care about
with dignity its the principle of the
thing i wont buy more tickets

   then you will have to get off at the
next station came firmly from the
official

  i think said miss forest that it
is too small a matter to argue about
hadnt we better get more tickets

  anything to gain time thought smith
ers as the conductor moved away with
the remark that he would return

   i am very sorry began the younjv
man  that my convictions arc so strong
i presented our tickets to the conductor
once and after that wc are entitled to a
ride i shall not buy more tickets

  and what a good reason he had as he
thought of the ten cents solitary in his
pockets

  then i think i shall rejoined miss
forest somewhat coldly

  this was terrible all smitherss vi-
sions of winning this girl faded from his
mind why had he hired that taxicab
and thus put himself in such a position
something must be done resides there
was his own return ticket which was at-
tached to that luckless missing bit of
stiff paper

  he looked hopelessly about him only
to encounter the amused glances of the
other passengers and in the distance the
tall form of the conductor returning to
obtain their decision

   i decline to buy any more tickets
said smithers in desperation

  this is humiliating said miss for-
est  i insist that cither you buy the
tickets or allow me to do so

  a great wave of hope crossed smith
erss face he suddenly recalled catch-
ing a glimpse of a fellow he knew in the
car behind

   all right sighed the young man as
though it were no longer possible to live
up to the conviction of a lifetime not to
allow oneself to be imposed upon  it
has occurred to me that in coming into
this car i might have brought the mis-
erable tickets with me after all and
dropped them on the way we passed
through the car behind you know i
will go in there and look for tficm  and
with great condescension  if  do not
find them  will purchase others


tiie argosy

  it nil depended upon his unsuspecting
acquaintance now

  smithers row with the same air of
resignation and passed into the rear oar
with a pretense of examining the aisle as
he advanced when he had  reached the
seat occupied hy his friend whom he had
not seen in years he cast a furtive glancc
behind him to be sure that miss forest
was not watching him and then grasped
the others hand in keen gratification

   im in a horrible hole jim he said
 tickets lost-girl with me whom i
hope to marry-no money-only going a
little way-help me out will you

   surely smithers-glad to how
much do you want  

  it was a self respecting person once
more who sat down beside miss forest
and explained in his most winning man-
ner that he would not have had this
thing happen while with her for the
world never had smithcrs purchased
articles with the enthusiasm which filled
him as he handed over the necessary
amount to the conductor and received
the little slips in return

  lie recognized the fact however that
the psychological moment for a proposal
of marriage would not be presented on
this journey so he made the most of a
now spoiled opportunity

  miss forest was very sweet during the
remainder of the ride in her attempt to
show smithcrs that she forgave him as

they descended from the train the girl
asked him to see if her friends were wait-
ing for her behind the station while she
looked to see if any others of the house-
party whom she knew had come by this
train

  the friends were there and smithcrs
returned but only to stand aghast at the
sight presented to him on the little plat-
form there in amused and animated
conversation stood miss forest and his
benefactor of the train they seemed
not to have noticed his return for he
caught the remark from the girl

   that w a peculiar experience in-
deed  and you say your friend had no
money we had a like experience hut
mr-

  smithcrs could stand it no longer

  your friends arc there miss forest
and i will say good-by

  the blank expression on the face of
miss forests companion caused that
young lady to burst into a merry laugh

  oh mr smithers why didnt you
explain to me mr gordon here has

done so unwittingly never suspecting
that you were with me but its all
right ict me introduce him to you mr
smithers and to show you that i for-
give you you shall he the first to hear of
our engagement we will announce it
to-day

    wish-you-heres my train said
smithers brokenly and fled

chapter 

iiic k and countercheck

t t alt there 

   i favored the fellow who had
stopped me with a gaze of lofty con-
tempt that i have known to impose upon
far wiser men

  but this awkward militia sergeant
was too stupid to be affected thereby
from flag to flag



   its like to he a hanging matter
he assented with a silly chuckle  but
not for iis step out of that boat now
lively or-

   but t protested with excellent in-
dignation  this is an outrage i am
rowing quietly up the patuxent for
morning exercise when you suddenly
appear at a curve of the stream and
level a half dozen guns at me ive
rowed close to shore to humor your whim
-and to save myself from a stray bul-
let but i fail to see why i should con-
sider myself under arrest or-

   you talk a lot friend grinned the
sergeant  but the weddin ceremonys
the only place i know about where talk
aint the cheapest thing on earth if
youve got a pass hand it over and ill
pologizc nnd let you go ahead if you
havent a pass youve no call to be on
the river and well have to-

   i saw no signs warning me oft
surely the river i free to all there
can be no harm in

   thats where youre wrong the
patuxents a mighty unhealthy stream
for strangers these days theyre liable
to suffer a whole lot from rush of rope
to the throat

  it was a grisly jest and i did not
echo the dutiful roar of laughter that
convulsed the speakers followers

   i bog you will curb your pretty
wit i remonstrated with an ifcmy that
was quite thrown away  amid all
those cacklcs some ones musket will be
by way of exploding and then ill lit-
erally  die of laughter  

  the self-appreciative smirk faded
from his lips

   friend he drawled his eyelids
narrowing  wo yankees dont use the
phrase  by way of thats redcoat
talk ill trouble you to step out of
that boat in a hurry potter mc-
queen grab hold of that prow and
ruu her ashore you others keep your
guns on him  

  i was fairly caught for a wild in-
stant i had thoughts of jumping into
the water and seeking safety by diving
but i was close to the bank where the
muddy river was too shallow for my
need

  again my eye fell on my fowling-
piece strapped to the thwarts but be-

    a

fore i could have unfastened and lifted
it my body would have been riddled
with bullets

  militiamen are of little use in battle
but on patrol duty they have a stupid
doggedness thnt often defies the clever-
est man in the case of disciplined sol
dicry my own military training and cus-
tom of command might have stood me
in good stead but against these farm
yokels new to their ill-fitting regi-
mentals it was of no avail i must
yield to the inevitable

  i remember once hearing the great
marquis dc lafayette say he would
rather face the rapiers of a dozen hired
bravos than the cudgels of half as many
angry peasants i was now in like case

  to avoid a useless scuffle and undue
rough handling i leaped ashore t had
scarce touched bank when four of the
fellows were upon me and had me
trussed and hound like any spitted fowl

  i made no struggle i think this sur-
prised my captors

   please have my gun and my lunch-
basket brought along i requested the
sergeant as calmly as  could  i do
not care to lose them where arc you
taking me to

   to headquarters he answered less
truculently  its only a few miles
back youll-

   sec that my belongings get there
safely then said i you will have
enough black marks against your rccord
before im done with you without hav-
ing to account for my fowling-piece
and-

   what were you doing when we
caught you

   you saw what i was doing

   you were rowing up the river
what for

   for snipe id planned for a days
hunting

   are you sure it was snipe

   what other game is in season this
time of year  asked with intentional
misunderstanding

   gunboats for one thing

  i gazed at him stupidly

   gunboats he repeated  commo-
dore barneys whole flotilla of em
your people are anxious enough to find
out where they are but you wont be
the man to bring em the news not


the argosy

this trip and if the provost marshals
the man  think he i there wont he
any return journey for you

  gunboats commodore barney
i gasped

  then fearing to seem to know too
little of what was then the most talked-
of theme in all the chesapeake country-
side i added

   oh youre speaking of the harney
flotilla thats been harrying admiral
cockburns war ships all year and keep-
ing the chesapeake free from invasion
what have i to do with it

   nothing now nor hereafter un-
less ghosts can spy

    spy  is an ugly word even for a
militia humpkin to use  retorted
if you think  was rowing up the
patuxent trying to find and sink har-
neys gunboats with a fowling-piece-
 or to tell your friends where his
flotilla is he suggested  cockhurn
might pay good money for that bit of
information hut he wont gel a chance
to pay it while three companies of mary-
land militia arc scattered along both
banks to stop britishers from getting too
curious youre the fifth thats been
nabbed since  began

   then i broke in with an admir
able pose of dawning comprehension
 im supposed to be a british spy and
trying to find whereabouts on the patux-
ent barney has hidden his gunboats to
keep them out of cockburns way till
the mobilizing of the english fleet in
the chesapeake is over  that it

   thats it lie agreed with another
prodigious grin  and now if you
can walk as well as you can make
guesses lets see how quick we can get
you to headquarters fall in i  he
shouted to his men  march  

  i walked along as carelessly as i
might between two of the soldiers but
 was not yet minded to give up the
game so iis we plodded on under the
broiling august sun  spoke again

   have you been long in the service
sergeant    queried

   ten months he rapped out
 joined in november  why

  and a sergeant already i ex-
claimed  a sergeant in spite of your
stupidity in thinking a spy would row
up the patuxent in broad daylight

where every addle-patcd jack in-office
could catch him

   tell that at headquarters

   if i had less to tell at headquarters
youd wear your sergeant stripes longer
itll go hard with some one for this days
mistakes

   shut up  he ordered gruffly as he
turned on me

  i was glad of his surliness for it be-
tokened a growing doubt and doubt
was what most i wished to instil into
his mind but for that cursed slip of
mine about being  by way of  think
he would have been content merely to
warn me back and let me go my home
ward course in peace now was my
chance to wipe out that unfortunate
lapse

   you accuse me of being a british
spy i resumed  it may be well to
have a clear understanding between us
 that my case when i state it at head-
quarters shall not be prejudicial to you
 am not a spy i am not an english-
man i am an american romney is
my name if you had orders to prevent
any one from going up the river you
could have ordered me back and no
harm would have been done instead
you charge me with spying and you tie
me up and march me between your men
like a convicted felon once more i
deny my guilt and make formal demand
on you for release

  lie halted hesitating the loosely
marching squad shambled to a full stop
all looked at me with varying degrees
of heavy curiosity

  youre american hey grunted
the sergeant at last  where are you
from 

   baltimore

   what ore you doing down here on
the patuxent  

   visiting friends i went out this
morning for a days-

   what friends 

  racking my memory only for a mo-
ment i spoke the first local name that
sprang to my mind

   i am guest at the manor-house of
colonel jared scholcs said i and
he will see that you answer for your
treatment of me

  the name produced an instant im-
pression but not quite the sort i had
from flag to flag



hoped for the sergeant scratched his
head and looked at me in frank per-
plexity yet mode no instant move to
sot me free

  youre stopping at colonel scholess
lie muttered

   yes the manor-house crowning
the hill above the bladcnsburg turn-
pike if you know the neighborhood at
all youll-

   oh i know the neighborhood he
made haste to reply  ive been on
duty here all year i know the scholcs
house too i low long have you been
stopping there

   not quite a week i answered
glad to see that i was bringing him to
reason

   what time did you leave his house
on this shooting picnic we just broke
up  

  at about seven this morning 
took a boat from clarges landing-you
know where that is-and had been
rowing about an hour when you over-
hauled me

   fairly beamed on him for at each
word of mine his bearing was growing
more and more deferential

  so he ruminated as i paused
 maybe wc have made a mistake sir
and i hope youll overlook it iiow
many folks are there at the scholes
house now sir a large party or-

  no at present i am the only
guest there are no-

   thats queer he murmured  some
one was telling me the colonel was ex-
pecting quite a party there this week or
next maybe-

   he is  answered glibly  but
they dont arrive till to-morrow night
at present there is no one but the
colonel his family and myself but it
is hot standing here if you will kindly
release me and apologize for your over-
zealous error i will not mention the af
fair to the colonel or to any one i-
 now thats real kind of you he
cried delightedly  and just to show
our appreciation well escort you right
to the colonels door-and inside its
no trouble to us to go there we were
on our way anyhow you see mr spy
thats our headouarters just now for
the past month the manor-house has been
chock-full of oftcers its queer you

didnt happen to notice any of em dur-
ing the week youve spent there fall
in there i march  

chapter ii

under false colors

  purii aivs you whose eyes have fol-
lowed my version of the foregoing scene
mny he as much at a loss concerning my
status as i had hoped to make the thick-
headed sergeant so briefly as may lie
 will explain how i dick romney
american chanced in this third year of
the war of  to fall captive to a
squad of my own countrys soldiers on
charge of being a british spy

  i comc of colonial new jersey stock
and passed my childhood in my native
state varying this habitat by long visits
to my mothers relatives in bladcnsburg
six miles from washington hence my
intimate knowledge of all the tract of
country where now i found myself

  my father-a former colonel in gen-
eral washingtons own new jersey bri-
gade-dying when  was but fourteen
my mother went to live with a sister in
england and took me with her my
elder brother inheriting the broad new
jersey estates nor had i seen my
native land again for full sixteen years

  i was educated in england imbibing
british customs and prejudices as might
any impressionable boy of my age and
had through family influence secured
at nineteen a commission in king
georges army

  bonaparte kept his majestys soldiers
busy in those days i can tell you and
the lieutenant with brains and pluck had
rare chances of advancement

  i was a colonel at twenty seven and
wore as mementoes of the peninsular
wars not only a sword slash over the
cheek received at the assault of ciudad
rodrigo but a distinguished service
order pinned to my breast by no less a
hand than that of wellington our
 iron duke

 well by the spring of  we had
bonaparte tied up safe and fast as we
thought at elba and for the moment
no other war save that with america
menaced england some fourteen thou-
sand of our peninsular veterans were


the argosy

ordered to the united states to help re-
duce uncle sams already hard-pressed
armies to utter submission

  my own regiment was one of those
shipped across seas on this mission
then it was that somewhat to my own
amaze i found  could not draw sword
against the land my father had risked
life and fortune to set free

  i had thought myself a thorough eng
lishman if i had not joined in my
fellow officers sneers at america i had
at least felt that my loyalty was all to
the british hag under whose shadow i
had so long and so successfully fought

  when in  war had broken out
between the united states and great
britain over the lattcrs high handed in-
sults to yankee seamen and yankee com-
merce i had been too busy fighting
soult dupont and massetia in the
spanish peninsula to trouble myself
over any problem farther afield than the
nearest french line beyond the fact
that americas many losses by land had
been partly atoned for by her brilliant
success in sea fights the  war of  
had meant comparatively little to me

  but when the question of taking up
arms against the old homeland arose
something within me cried out against
the deed on impulse i sold my com-
mission and resigned from the british
army

  as i was loafing drearily about lon-
don a month later-for nothing is so
wearisome to a soldier as the days of
enforced idleness following active serv-
ice-news reached me of my elder
brothers death and of my own heirship
to the new jersey property

  i planned to set out at once for amer-
ica to take possession but at the same
time i learned that my old commander
general ross was to take four regiments
of our peninsular veterans and reenforce
admiral coekburn on the chesapeake
stirring times were promised and at
thought of missing so much of the mar-
tial excitement which for years had
been as meat and drink to me  hit on
a very natural and simple plan

  i stated my case to ross explaining
that though i could not turn against the
land of my birth i longed to follow the
future deed of my old peninsular com-
rades the talk ended by his appoint-

ing me honorary major on his personal
staff in strictly non-combatant capacity
and with the thorough understanding
that i should be employed merely in a
clerical position and not expected to aid
in any way in his plans against america

  so it was that late in july i found
myself with thirty-five hundred penin-
sular veterans in rosss camp at the
mouth of the chesapeake

   there for the first time i set eyes on
that most picturesque daredevil of the
ogc-admiral george coekburn com-
mander of the blockade which england
was enforcing along all the atlantic
coast

   verily believe the man was a bit in
sane i low else explain his boundless
generosity and ferocious cruelty his
kindnesses and barbarities his wild gay
boyishness and crafty strategic wiles
he was a mass of utter contradictions
and withal the most lovable grotesque
figure of two continents

  it was at mess in the impromptu army
and navy club organized in our camp
that the subject of barneys flotilla had
come up

  this fleet of gunboats had done more
than everything else to mar cockburns
blockading schcmes so he had mo-
bilized his fleet in overwhelming num-
bers at the chesapeakes mouth not only
to cooperate with ross on an inland
raid but to crush barney once and for-
ever

  but as though by magic the whole
flotilla had vanished before his approach
its whereabouts was a mystery and a de-
cidedly needful thing to determine

  for neither ross nor coekburn rel-
ished the idea of stripping the british
fleet of such mariners as would be neces-
sary for the invasion if in their ab-
sence barneys gunboats might be ex-
pected to bear down on the ill-defended
shipping and destroy it leaving the ad-
vancing army cut off from escape

  accordingly coekburn had sent out
a veritable swarm of spies in search of
the flotilla but such as had not been
captured had returned as ignorant as
they had set out

  coekburn was in a fine rage i can
assure you and his language was a lib-
eral education to iven the most voluble
teamsters in camp
i-rom fiag to flag



  i had a theory of my own t knew
the course of the near-by patuxent and
realized how easy it would be to secrctc
n whole royal squadron in some of its
sheltered upper reaches this nows i
did not import to my friends for was
i not strictly non-combatant-a mere
spectator 

   hut in reply to a wrathful declaration
of cockburns that  not a man who
trod boot-leather had the wit to find the
pestilent yankee hulks i had made
shift to reply modestly that i would be
willing to wager twenty guineas i could
locate the llotilla within forty-eight
hours

  cockburn snapped up the bet before
it was fairly made so i hastened to
add that though i was certain  could
find ha neys fleet i had no intention
whatsoever of divulging its wherealouts
i offered however to seek it and on my
return to state on my honor as an officer
and gentleman whether or not  had dis-
covered the flotilla

  cockburn was vastly chapfallen at
this addendum to my boast but like the
insatiate gambler he was took the wager
on my own terms others of the mess
too backcd one or the other of us until
a goodly sum hung on the result

   set forth in civilian garb on my
own private quest half the spare cash
of the camp hanging on my success

  lest you who read may judge this
freak trivial pray understand that it
was an ora of unbridled gambling and
that he who made and won the wildest
wager stood highest in regimental fame
when the constitution old ironsides
fought and sank the gucrriere at sea it
is a historic fact that the battle was the
outcome of a bet and that the rival com-
manders hull and ducre had wagered
a cockcd-hat on the result

   he all that as it may i was but twelve
hours on my search of the patuxents
back-waters when my friend the ser-
geant with his squad overhauled me
my own folly had done the rest

   and now thanks to silly blunders and
overconfidence i found myself under
arrest as a spy

   at first as the irritation wore off i
was inclined to laugh at py plight
then studying the matter more closcly

i grew grave

  i could foresee that it would be no
simple matter to explain to some preju-
diced united states provost marshals
satisfaction that i had embarked on this
mission merely to win a bet and that 
had given my word not to divulge to
cockburn- in event of my success-the
whereabouts of the fleet also that i
though on the british major-generals
staff was a non-combatant and had no
designs against my country

  yes the whole thing would sound un-
convincing disgustingly so instinc-
tively i tried to loosen my neck-cloth
it had begun to feel uncomfortably like
a rope

the girl

  it was high noon when we drew up in
front of colonel scholcss great manor-
house on the hill-crest overlooking the
dladcnsburg turnpike the sergeant
left us standing there in the scorching
sun of the driveway the curious center
of a hundred loafing soldiers while he
entered the house to report

  five minutes later he returned and
ushered me up the steps across the deep
porch and through the wide-open door-
way into the central hall of the manor

  the cool and gloom of the place were
grateful after our long hot tramp my
eyes growing used to the dim light as
i was brought to a halt showed me a
stout man seated at a table in the center
of the hall about the placc sat or
lounged several officers anti a civilian or
two

  this is the prisoner general re
ported the sergeant saluting and fall-
ing back a pace at my side

  the man at the table looked up and
surveyed my perspiring dusty self with
mechanical interest even in that brief
instant of mutual scrutiny i noted how
harassed and bothered was his wrinkled
face

  he had the air of a man who has been
nagged almost to desperation nor as
i was later to learn did this nspect
belle him

  but there was something else in his
face that set my heart to jumping in a
fashion wholly unconnected with any


the argosy

fear it was a resemblance-of expres-
sion rather than feature -that made me
forget my present danger and sent my
mind flying back to the other side of the
ocean

  another moment and i knew of what
the mans not especially handsome visage
reminded me

  a winding garden path beyond the
mission guest-house near madrid -a
meeting with one i had not seen since
childhood-the pressure of a girlish
hand the clear frank look of a girls
eyes - a few days acquaintanceship
whose memory  had never been wholly
able to lose

  why did this plump middle-aged
man recall all these visions to me to
me who stood in the shadow of the rope

  who are you i blurted out even
as his lips had parted to make the initial
query of his examination

  it was the oddest least-expected hap-
pening in the world-this inquisition of
a general by his prisoner and a ruffle
of quickly checked laughter ran through
the group of spectators

  one man a civilian who from a
sofa near by had been scanning a close-
written document looked up with
eager amused interest and thrust his
paper into his pocket

   did not expect the general to reply
to my impertinence unless to chide it
but lie as well a- myself seemed mo-
mentarily off guard

  for he answered apparently before
the peculiarity of my question had the
opportunity to strike him

   i am general winder in command
of the-

  then checking himself with a frown
he added hastily

   the examination will begin

  i scarcely heard him

  winder now it was explained
this haunting likeness

  the winders-doubtless relatives of
his - had owned the estate next my
fathers in new jersey oil the day
when i a hobbledehoy youth of four-
teen left for england i had received
a solemn ardent proposal of marriage
my first and last-from no less a person
than seven-year old dorothy winder
my neighbors only daughter and my
own best beloved playmate

  she had on that day of parting tear-
fully begged me to comc bock as soon
as i should be grown up and marry her
with the pitying condescension of a big
boy for a little girl i had gravely prom-
ised

  nor had  given her i fear a second
thought for the next fourteen years
then two years before my return to
america we had met by pure chance at
the guest-house outside madrid

  she was making the  grand tour
with her father for two blissful days i
had prolonged my stay at the tumble-
down old guest house seeking dorothys
company at every moment and post-
poning dangerously long my return to
duty

  for there was something about that
tall willowy gul with her level gray
eyes that one does not find in european
damsels we had talked over old times
she had told me of the old home and
of all that had happened in the unevent-
ful routine of life there since my de-
parture and had listened with flattering
interest to the talc of my few petty war
experiences

  then i had ridden away but fast
as  might ride or hard as  might fight
i could never thenceforth wholly rid
myself of that odd  hidden laughter
expression of hors nor the level clear
look of her eyes

  those same eyes had stayed in my
mind to the prohibition of many a gay
escapade in which my comrades reveled
and more than once i had half wished
i might rid myself of their memory

  when the chance had come to go to
my own country again and settle down
among the hills of my childhood i had
all along recognized my chief if uncon-
fessed motive in taking advantage of it
was i in love with dorothy winder
iiow can i say

  it never so occurred to me in those
days to think ever of her seemed nat-
ural that was all

  i was still tracing idly that faint fam-
ily likeness in my inquisitors face and
he was forced to repeat a question  had
let pas unheard

   your name  

   richard romney

   from-  

   new jersey
from flag to flag

-

   j erscymen pronouncc the  r  in
their states name somewhat more dis-
tinctly than you do he commented
 what section  

   pompton

   pompton ch he snapped looking
up at me with a new cunning  i
chance to have relatives there

  squire gabriel winder i suggest-
ed  his place adjoins mine on the
right on the left are the lands of the
old patroon-petrus rverson the
winder estate on the other side touche
the schuylers

  general  inder leaned back clearly
puzzled the others too seemed more
interested the young mail on the sofa
was frankly enjoying the scene

   you seem to have some knowledge
of jersey topography admitted the
general  but it proves nothing you
sny you are one of the pompton rom-
neys vet you are several hundred
miles away from home and talking like
an englishman how do you account
for that  

   you must be william winder at-
torney at law of philadelphia i coun-
tered  vet you also are some distance
from home and in the uniform of a
general is the one harder to under-
stand than the other 

   insolcnce will not save you sir i
cried the general flushing  i warn you
you will not help your case by such talk
you arc under grave suspicion and-
then sir said i if i might sug-
gest suppose we get down to business
i can lift that same  grave suspicion
more easily when  know its nature up
to the present time we seem to be en-
gaging in n rather useless genealogical
contest cant we go faster i merely
suggest it

   sir i  thundered the now thorough-
ly irate general  are you aware of your
position arc you informed who and
what i am that you-

   i have had much useless informa-
tion thrust upon me from time to time
i yawned

  there was a stifled snicker from the
officers but i saw the man on the sofa
frown slightly his bright interested
face showed a trace of disappointment
and i was almost sorry for my gross
flippancy

    shall ask you to answer my ques-
tions truthfully proceeded winder
swallowing his wrath with a certain stiff
dignity  remember sfr truth will be
best for you in the end if you try to
deceive me as to

   if i answer your questions at all
 retorted  i shall do so truthfully
but up to now permit me to remind
you the only questions youve done me
the honor to ask were concerning my
name and the geography of northern
new jersey on neither of those counts
i take it am  under arrest

   you are under arrest sir on the
charge of being a british spy

   i-can answer that accusation in one
sentence i am not a spy and  am
not british

   you were found inside the lines in
civilian dress you speak with a strong
english accent

   there arc probably several thousand
civilians like myself insido the lines in
civilian dress  answered  that
gentleman on the sofa over there for
instance yet no one arrests them as
for my english accent  was educated
in england like many another native-
born american

   if you are a soldier at all pursued
winder  you are not in the ranks
your bearing and education prove that
do you hold a commission in the british
army 

  i do not

   commanding officer to inspect
guard mount  called the man on the
sofa mimicking the high-pitched nasal
tone and clipping words of an english
aide-de-camp

  at the sound before i could recollect
my pose of civilian i had clicked my
heels together dropped my left hand to
where my saber had been wont to hang
and made a half-face-about toward the
door

  then too late i saw the trap wherein
 had fallen it did not need the bellow
of amusement from the others to tell me
how habit had betrayed me into a maneu-
ver which no civilian could have thought
of executing

  i turned wrathfully toward the sofa
its occupant alone of all the by-
standers was not laughing

  his handsome young face showed


the argosy

genuine regret lie fore winder could
open his mouth the man was on his feet
beside inc

    spoke without thinking general
he pleaded his deep voice vibrant with
contrition  it was a scurvy trick to
play and -with a graceful how to me
- i ask thin gentlemans pardon mny
i beg that you will not take his impul-
sive act into consideration  

   i am sorry mr key replied the
general  but you must see how impos-
sible it is for me to comply with your
wish you very cleverly stripped the
mask from this fellow and i thank you
the investigation now will be easier

   hut it is not fair protested key
  took him unaware and by recalling
an order i used to hear when i was in
england years ago if i have preju-
diced bis case will you let me make
uncnds by acting as his counsel  though
 am not a military judgc-advocate yet
as you know i am a meinler in good
standing of the washington bar may
 serve as his lawyer

 tush fumed winder the
whole things curscdly irregular as it
stands weve caught a british officer
in civilian dress inside our lines what
else is there to it the case is clear
prisoner- waving the protesting mr
key aside and wheeling about to face
me- have you any logical reason to
offer why sentence should not be passed
upon you  

   had not  knew how futile would
be my plea were i to tell the whole
truth  was in a vise again that cu-
rious tightness of my neck-cloth and the
sensation as of rope about my throat

  well it was the chance of war had
it come in the regular performance of
my military duties i should not have
murmured hut to have fought un-
scathed through the fearful peninsular
campaigns and now having laid down
my sword to die by hanging to have
braved napoleon bonaparte only to fall
into the hands of william  winder
ex-attorney at law 

   the sentence of the court began
the general solemnly  is that you be
taken from this spot to the guard-house
and that at sunset-

  i protest broke in key the
prisoners guilt is not conclusively proven

that being the case i warn you that i
shall ride at once to washington and
lay the matter before president madi-
son i believe he will grant a stay if
not a pardon

  i saw that shadow of worry and al-
most of fear creep back over winders
puckered brow at mention of the presi-
dent he hesitated then broke into
petty rage

   mr key he tormed  you arc in-
terfering where you have no business
i must request you to be silent and with-
draw at once from this case if you do
not i shall place you under arrest i
am master here i am commander of
the army of defense in the-

  arc you

  keys brief query was respcctful
almost deferential quite free from
slur or sneer yet it cnt the blood to
winders face and his look of worry
deepened

  what peevish retort he made i know
not for just then  saw her

  she was coming slowly down the
broad stair her clinging white dress
swishing gently at each step her dainty
little high-heeled shoes clicking a soft
tattoo against the polished wood

  down she came the cool green light
filtering through the closed blinds and
seeming to caress the willowy lines of
her figure a single ray of sunshine
through a nick in the shutters struck
athwart her dusky hair turning it golden
and throwing a shimmering aura about
her proud little head

  oh it was good to have seen her thus
-cool regal girlish infinitely lovely
it was gooil to have seen her if for the
last time on earth

  forgotten was the death that loomed
heavy above me forgotten that mortal
fenr that had sanded my throat the
clash and quarrel of the two men over
my tenuous life

  all i saw all i knew all i eared
was that she was coming toward me
down the stairway i low she chanced
to be there  no more paused to won-
der than one wonders at the strange
persons and places heaped together in
some wonder-dream

   she reached the stair-foot not ten feet
away from me evidently unaware that
business was going forward it was then
from flag to fiag

-

that both winder and key stopped their
squabble and looked nt me

   suppose one of them had asked me
some question i had not heard and
that wondering at my silence they had
turned to note the causc

  for their eyes now followed the di-
rection of mine  fell rather than
noted keys little involuntary start of
joyous surprise winder blustered pet-
tishly

   please dont interrupt me just now
dorothy we are very busy

  she bowed and passed on she had
not so much as seen me all the world
grew at once very dark

  winder was beginning to address me
again when  heard a young officer who
had risen and bowed nt the girls ap
prouch whisper in loud self-importance
to dorothy

   the generals trying a spy

  she turned curious toward our group
at the table and our eyes met

chapter iv

a happy respite

  how dorothy winder recognized the
spruce dragoon coloncl of the madrid
days in the disheveled dusty prisoner
who leaned across her uncles table
staring dazedly at her i do not know
womens eyes are better than mens for
piercing mere externals

  but certain it is that after one in-
stants survey she swept forward with
both hands outstretched

   colonel komney  dick   she cried
dropping back in the excitement of the
moment to the familiar address of our
childhood

  and i shouldering my way past the
two guard who stood beside me had
sprung forward and grasped those cool
white little hands in my own hot eager
grip

  dorothy i muttered confused
unreasonably happy

  it was my loss of self-control i
think that brought her to herself and
to the fact that others were present to
whom my ecstatic gawky greeting must
be making us both ridiculous

  it is always the woman who first re-
covers self-possession so it was now

she drew back slightly and turning to
me said

   you have come home at last we
hoped in pompton youd return now
that the estate is yours but how did
you run the blockadc  

   in the simplest possible way an-
swered i loudly an inspiration coming
to me   crossed with rosss trans-
ports you know  used to be in his
brigade in spain after  left the army
i wanted to come back and settle at the
old home so i put my case to ross
and he gave me transportation landing
me safe at the chesapeake as soon as
this invasion scare is over and i can get
conveyance of some sort i shall start
north

  it was not to her but through her to
the others that i was talking all at
oncc the hitherto tangled affair had be-
come absurdly simple with dorothy
to identify me my case took on quite a
new color

  and even as i spoke  realized my
words carried weight the two guards
had moved toward me again but jen-
cral winder motioned them back and
himself rose and stepped forward

   you know this gentleman it seems 
he said rather unnecessarily to dorothy

 why of course she replied
 wc were children together at pomp-
ton then we met in madrid two
years ago  thi is lieutenant-colonel
richard romncy-general winder my
uncle

 there was a somewhat awkward
pause  broke it by saying in explana-
tion 

   your arrival was decidedly timely
miss winder your uncle under a mis-
apprehension was about to-

  the general purpled and tugged sur
rcptitiously at my sleeve but key
caught up my story at cxactly the proper
point and went on with a half laugh

   colonel romncy was met by a squad
of skirmishers and brought here on sus-
picion his own story and your recog-
nition miss winder turn an annoying
situation into a capital joke

   i remember now exclaimed
dorothy with a little gasp  captain
vokcs said you were trying a spy
surely you didnt think-

   yokes was mistaken rapped out
f

the argosy

winder hastily colonel romney i
suppose wc owe you an apology i
hope youll keep our unfortunate error
to yourself you see in troublous times

like these-

  he paused the harassed almost
cowed look was again on his face i
was yet to learn how cruelly the man
was hampered at every step how severe-
ly and persistently the administration
nagged and harried him

  from a naturally good soldier he was
fast degenerating into a badgered un-
certain subaltern to tins trait per-
haps i owed in part his willingness to
drop the case against me rather than
run the risk of a reprimand from the
war department for molesting in im-
portant new jersey landowner

   scuse me genral muttered the
sergeant who had captured me tiptoeing
forward and trying to gain winders pri-
vate ear  but that aint the story he-

   pooh-pooh man i  sputtered the
general testily  that will do youve
made a blunder that ought to cost you
your rank sergeant mccrea he off i
next time learn to discriminate between
a spy and a gentleman

  as the discomfited mccrea shuffled
back among his fellows his lowering
gaze met mine  took no great pains
to check a smile of malicious triumph
he caught the look and i knew in a
flash he still believed me a spy and held
me responsible for his reprimand

  his was one of those narrow long
heads that belong as a rule to a man
who does not forget mentally i made
a note to be on guard against him
should we meet again and i felt it
would be no fault of his if we did not

   accepted winders invitation to re-
main to lunch and until the heat of the
day should be past he went further
by offering me a horse and a passport
to insure my speedier and safe journey
north

  in the afternoon  had a long de-
lightful talk with dorothy in the shaded
gallery above-stairs she was to have
ridden across to an aunts in bladens-
burg directly after luncheon she told
me as her visit to general winder and
his wife was at an end and key was
to have been her escort

  she delayed the departure until sun-

down at my urgent plea key was
forced reluctantly to set off without her
for he had affairs of moment in bla-
densburg

  lie showed no outward chagrin at
having to go alone though i could see
how unwillingly he gave up the pros-
pect of the five-mile ride with her

  there was something very winning
about the young lawyer who had so gal-
lantly come to my defense one could
not help liking him it was with gen-
uine regret that i bade him farewell for
what  then foolishly supposed was the
last time

  it was a dreamy utterly happy after-
noon  spent on the long veranda at
dorothys side we talked of every con-
ceivable subject save that which lay
close to my heart that could-must-
wait until i had had chance to woo her
in due form

  i foresaw a pastoral beautiful court-
ship amid my quiet jersey hills when
her visit to her southern relatives should
be finished and we should both find
ourselves in the dear old northern state
again

  in the meantime i told her of the
end of my soldiering and of my deter-
mination to live in america it was on
my tongue-tlp to confess the ridiculous
story of my twenty  guinea bet with
coekburn

  but the wager which had seemed so
amusing when made amid the riot and
song of a mess table did not now ap-
peal to me as the kind of thing of
which this clear-eyed new jersey girl
would approve so like a fool  let
pass the opportunity

  dorothy had much to tell me of the
war i was surprised at her ardent
patriotism for such was not then the
tone of the country at large

  as history shows the general feeling
up to this time in the war of 
had been of a decidedly lukewarm pas-
sionless sort it was hard to believe
this faction-wrung  moderate  nation
was made up of the sons of men who
had conquered at yorktown starved at
valley forge and died for their free-
dom at concord and lexington

  i commented on this to dorothy

   it will come  she cricd with checks
aglow it will come the spirit of
from fla to flag



 is not dead when it awakens eng-
land will be made to feel it ax she felt
it oncc before and she will be the first
to cry for peace

  a faint curl of smoke smeared the
southern horizon it caught our gaze
and dorothy pointed toward it

   look  she cxclaimcd  another
village sacked and burnt more of
demon cockburns horrible work he
has ravaged our const as mercilessly as
though we lived in the days of the norse
pirates

  arent you hard upon cockburn
war is war

   is it war to burn defenseless villages
and murder unarmed people if so-

   hut cockburn is an nwfully good
chap in his way

 you know him she asked in
pained amaze

   i have met him said i with a be-
lated caution

  she shuddered

   i wonder she went on  if it is
really true that he and general ross
mean to march on washington

  it was my turn for amazement ross
fondly hoped no american knew of his
daring project to strike inland and at-
tack the nations capital he and cock
burn had resolved to make the dash be-
fore sufficient troops could be massed to
block their progress should they be
successfully opposed-as even in their
most sanguine moments they feared they
would- it could be explained to the gov-
ernment as a mere reconnaissance

  if on the other hand by rare good
luck they could seize washington it
meant unheard-of glory for both

   is there talk of such an attempt  i
asked

   that is why my uncle has been sent
here she returned  and why the militia
for miles around are concentrating they
say it is only the fear of commodore
barney that holds the british back if
once they could find where his flotilla is
hidden-

  oh what a temptation to put the ques-
tion  to ask where is it hidden
but i could not use this pure girls con-
fidence as means toward the winning of
my wretched bet so i changed the sub-
ject and the conversation drifted pleas-
antly from politics to self

   i go north next month she said at
last as the sun hung low and i rose to
depart i shall expect to find you
settled as squire peace justice and all
other titles that go with your position
by the time i reach pompton but
wont you find it stupid to rust as a coun-
try gentleman after all your years of ad-
venture  

   no i answered shortly

   i should think you would she per-
sisted idly

   you should think nothing of the
sort i retorted as i held out my hand in
farewell  it rests with you

  she seemed to understand all that lay
behind my words or perhaps it was
the glow of sunset that flushed her won-
derful face

   in a month then said i as my
good-byes to the others all spoken i ran
down the steps to where a trooper held
my horse

   in a month  she replied gaily

  and there was no warning spirit to
whisper to either of us a hint of the
myriad stirring events wherein we two
side by side were to play our part be-
fore that short month was at an end

chapter v

on risky work

  i had turned out of the grounds of
the manor-house and was about to put
my horse to a canter when along the
road toward me advanced sergeant me-
crea he had evidently been awaiting
my exit in order to speak to me on neu-
tral ground

  the sight of the man touched me with
compunction he had made a rlever
arrest and had in reward received un-
just rebuke and had seen his prey escape

  i drew up and awaited him

   im sorry you got the reprimand
i said tossing him a gold guinea  you
musnt let it discourage you my man

  now in england so condescending a
speech combined with so lavish a gift
from a colonel to a mere  non-com
would in those days have filled the latter
with almost slavish gratitude hence-
for i knew little of my own country-
men-his reply astounded me

  catching the coin deftly in air lie spat


the argosy

contemptuously upon it and then letting
the golden disk fall to the road ground
it into the dust with his hobnailed heel

  im not your man mr spy he
growled  but youre the  man  of king
george whose face is stamped on that
guinea ive showed you how we yan-
kees treat his face maybe my timell
come to do the same to your own when
it does-

   do you realize i broke in control-
ling my hot temper at his insolence and
speaking quietly  do you realize  could
repeat that speech to general winder
and have you not only degraded from
rank but flogged as well  

   you can get me  broke  he retort-
ed  and i spose you will but wc
dont hog free men in the american
army wc leave that to john bull and
his officers who spy because theyre too
cowardly to fight ive been waiting for
you mister i wanted to tell you that
you wriggled out of trouble pretty slick
to-dav but im laying for you and some
day or other ill git you understand
some day when there wont be a petti-
coat for you to hide behind

  i saw nothing would suit him better
than a furious verbal wrangle but i
had neither time nor wish to bandy words
further with a yankee sergeant so i
put spurs to my horse and without a
second thought for the fellows threat
galloped off

  but the brief colloquy had had the
effect of banishing from my mind the
glamour of the long happy afternoon
and i found myself riding on in a de-
cidedly black reckless mood then it
was that my insensate idea came to me

  for a mile or so my northward road
lay alongside the river what was to
prevent my continuing for a few miles
farther along its banks on the chance of
coming upon traces of barneys flotilla
could  but find the little fleets where-
abouts i might under cover of night
ride back to rosss camp arrive there by
dawn claim my wager and at once con-
tinue my northern journey

  armed as i was with winders pass
none could turn me back it irked me
to think of having boastfully declared to
cockburn that i could locate barneys
gunboats-and then to go north with
my boast unfulfilled moreover dozens

of men at the mess relying on my pledge
and on my reputation for resource had
bucked my wager heavily

  why should i be the cause of these
old friends losing money many of them
could ill spore

  it was not as though  were going to
reveal to cockburn the whereabouts of
the flotilla as i have said he had
agreed to take my unsupported word that
i had succeeded where his best spies had
fidled

  no i do not pretend to excuse the
folly of my whim i am not a hero or a
wise man i have never claimed to be
either perhaps that is why the mad
notion took strong and stronger hold of
me the more  thought it over

  dusk had long fallen and the full
moon stood low and red in the east when
i halted my horse at last after a two-
hour reconnaissance of the upper reaches
of the patuxent i had spent the inter-
vening time scouring the shore peering
through the dim light into every sheltered
cove but i had seen no sign of the
hidden flotilla

  my wild mood had died and i was
about to turn back unsuccessful toward
the turnpike then strike off to the north-
ern road

  even as i came to the resolve my eye
was caught by a distant spot of yellow
light not that of fire but a gleam as of
moonlight reflected on some polished sur-
face

  the gleam shone through a mass of
foliage in a scrub-oak grove perhaps a
hundred yards from the road the river
ran parallel to the highway this grove
was at right angles to it yet memory
of the countless backwaters and bays
along the streams course started a train
of reasoning in my mind

  the gleam  had seen was yellowish
not like that from glass but from bright
metal what metal body could he con-
cealed in the grove

  i dismounted tied my horse and ad-
vanced on foot crouching and moving
with the silent caution learned by long
scouting trips taking advantage of every
bit of shadow along my route

  coming to the groves edge i saw
that it was no ordinary patch of wood-
land but a well-nigh impenetrable
the coat of amos koppercrust



thicket bordering a lagoon of considera-
ble size the spot of light i had long
since lost and  was now walking by
my recollection of its general locality

  so creeping along in the shade i
skirted the wood catching now and then
a glimmer of water ahead of me between
the low lying branches

  at a point a few rods from where 
had readied the groves edge  noted a
thinning of foliage and underbrush
barely three feet wide from whence 
could command a fair view of the ex-
panse of lagoon hut the moon was still
too low to permit me to gain more than
a general idea of a shimmering watery
surface

   must wait until the luminary should
arise high enough to top that screen of
leafage and shine unobscured upon the
lagoon then i should be able to solve
my doubts and to learn whether or not
that spot of light had really come from
some bit of brass-work on a gunboat

   dared not advance into the wood
meanwhile for fear of running foul of
any shore-picket who might be stationed
there

  little by little the moon edged up-
ward i did not stand with bated breath
as do scouts in story books the whir
of summer insects and the calls of whip-
poorwills drowned any ordinary low
sound

  at last a clear bar of moonlight fell
across the lagoon spreading until the wa-
ters were silver bright i caught my
breath as i watched

  for on that gleaming surface at regu-
lar intervals and with no lantern show-
ing lay black moveless hulks their fan
tom spars rising like ghosts above the
silent decks

   one - two - three - four-five i
counted and so on until i came to the
full quota

  my bet was won the whole missing
flotilla was tucked away safe and hid
den out of cockburns reach and await-
ing its time to rush back to the scene of
war

  with a smothered laugh at my own
cleverness  drew back out of the frame
of boughs and-turned to confront a
leveled pistol not eight inches from my
head

the coat of amos koppercrust

  by  jaukhtt swift

                 the unsought romance that found its way into the life of
                 a knight of the road capped by an astounding revelation

the wind howled and shrieked
around the eaves of amos kop-
percrusts house in demoniac and unholy
glee and it made its way ii no pleas-
ant fashion through the rents and tatters
of timothy rlngbottoms garments

  there would be no particular reason
for mentioning this in the same breath
were it not for the fact that timothy
ringbottom was wearily hungrily and
thirstily trudging along the highway
toward the house of amos kopper-
crust and upon this seemingly unim-
portant fact hangs a talc

  being the first seen in the matter
timothy ringbottom must be first in-
troduced  hate introductions they

are usually awkward affairs anyway
but timothy ringbottom must be intro-
duced

  in his relation to mankind in general
timothy ringbottom could scarcely be
called an asset and as the chronicler
of his fortune or misfortune as you may
decide for yourself i should dislike to
proclaim him a liability

  as a matter of fact timothy ring-
bottom bad done nothing so long that
he had become accustomed to it not
that timothy was lazy he had walked
from chicago almost to new york in
earnest search of work and he had
always heard of opportunities farther on

  hut when he wearily trudged farther


the argosy

on the opportunities seemed somehow to
evaporate vanish into thin air disap-
pear around a corner or something
and again timothy would learn of op-
portunities farther on

  and yet there was nothing wrong
about the man himself he had never
committed a crime

  stealing barn - burning abducting
kidnaping forging note-raising murder
none of these as a matter of business had
ever entered his head yet he was capa-
ble so far aymere mental ability went
of doing any of these things

  no timothy ringbottom had never
done anything very wrong

  rut on the other hand he had never
done anything particularly good the
chicf claim he had to the gratitude of
mankind was the fact that he had ab-
stained from the other things mentioned

  and here he was on a road he fondly
believed led to new york and unlimited
opportunity and prosperity so hungry he
could scarcely walk so thirsty he seemed
to be chewing cotton and with holes in
his clothes big enough to fall through
without bothering the broken buttons
and suspenders that held them on

  and he wasnt a bad-looking fellow
this timothy ringbottom he had an
amiable face an intelligent eye and a
way with him

  as we have already learned he was
wending his weary way toward the
house of amos koppercrust which
leads up to the unpleasant necessity of
introducing amos

  amos was of a far different type of
man he had always done everything
and everybody

  he had an office in the city where he
carried on a real-estatc brokerage busi-
ness loaned money on first mortgages at
five per cent and on second mortgages
at six and foreclosed both as soon as
he got a chance

  he was tall thin scrawny

  there was never any question in the
minds ol those who knew him that amos
koppercrust had money nor if there
was any around that he would get it

  his house was a pretty respectable
affair for the culbertson road and as
timothy ringbottom approached it a
peculiar sensation as of a premonition
of a coming dinner arose in his mind

  the gate was open timothy en-
tered it gratified him to see that un-
like other rural residences this place
had no dogs to add to the already numer-
ous holes in his garments

  so it was that from the highway he
boldly walked to the front porch and
rang the bell by pulling the knob in the
orthodox way

  as amos koppercrust was not at
home another introduction becomes nec-
essary for mrs koppercrust was

  now there were rumors that at one
time-no matter how long ago-mrs
koppercrust had been a good looking
generous and sociable young woman
what was left of her was inclined to be
sociable still

  hut in his sordid greed for gain amos
koppercrust had starved her brow-
beaten her kept her penuriously pinned
down to household drudgery till the
faded face retaining some of its one-
time sweetness seemed also to show a
longing for that eternal rest that comes
to most of us too soon

  when timothy ringbottom rang the
bell mrs koppercrust opened the door

   madam aid mr ringbottom
with an elaborate bow  may  ask if
your mother is at home

   my mother has been dead for years
said mrs koppercrust

   no one would have imagined so
young a person as yourself to be an
orphan said mr ringbottom  is it
possible being a fact not to doubt
your veracity it must also be possible
may i address yu as miss

   no said mrs koppercrust waver-
ing between one desire to slam the door
in his face and another to ask him in
 i am mrs koppcrcrust

  lucky koppercrust said king-
bottom   admire his good judgment
and envy him his good fortune

   anyway said mrs koppcrcrust
 what do you want  

  madam lie replied you see lc-
fore you a most unfortunate man i am
not only a most unfortunate man but i
am an unfortunate man in most ways
possible leaving chicago in possession
of a respectable fortune entrusted y a
great railroad syndicate with a very im-
portant and sccrct embassy to another
great railroad syndicate in new york i

was set upon by enemies of my employ-
ers robbed beaten and injured

   i sent news of my unfortunate mis-
hap to my employers but they refused to
believe me as a result i am still on
my way to new york to complete my
commission madam even though dogs
wild beasts and men tear me and rend
me  shall be faithful to my trust no
man shall say that  have failed in the
performance of my duty

   you poor dear man  

  but continued ringbottom seeing
his advantage  i need the assistance of
all kind-hearted people i ask no
money i have no great need of money
still if in the excess of christian charity
that now illumines your youthful face
you really wished to force upon me a
small donation  would accept it as a
loan to be repaid after th reward of my
honorable intentions has been reaped in
new york

   good lands i i aint got no money
i never sec money my husband aint a
poor man nor yet he aint such a rich
one but he-

   madam  appreciate the situation
without further words having taken
you from your fathers luxurious and re-
fined home he has failed to furnish you
with those stipendiary forces to which
your countenance shows you were accus-
tomed but you eat

  as mrs koppercrust had always been
jis poor as a church mouse before she
married the broker she bowed and ad-
mitted that they did have enough to eat

  she invited the stranger in she took
him to the kitchen where she placed a
pood dinner before him

   your husband does not appreciate
you said ringbottom  i never ate
a dinner i enjoyed more than this

   it is a waste of words to tell that this
was true

   i wish i had some money to give
you said the hostess

   and docs not your husband some-
times forget does he not leave money
where you might find ii  

   no ive looked everywhere ive
spent hours trying to find some ho
pays the bills ive ransacked his
bureau-driwers and every other place 
could think of tic never forgets-
where money is concerned

  all well perhaps-it is cold weather
now-you could take some unused gar-
ment that would letter protect me from
the wind and he would never know
that you gave it to an unfortunate but
deserving gentleman

   why-i dont know you do look
shabby enough id think youd freeze
your coat is all in rags

   the result of trying to defend my-
self against rogues

   m  amos isnt mean when it comes
to his own clothes lie does sure have
plenty of coats wait till i see

  she left him she was not afraid
although the house was well furnished
and there was silver on the buffet in the
dining-room she was so honored and
flustered by what the glib foot-travclcr
had said that she never thought of dan-
ger

  and now as the chronicler of the for-
tunes of timothy ringbottom  am
proud to say that her trust was not be-
trayed ringbottom never left his chair

  he was warm he no longer felt the
pangs of hunger thirst had no imme-
diate terrors for him for the tea was
good he was grateful

  there said mrs koppcrcrust re-
turning with a rusty looking corduroy
coat  that coats been a hangiu in
the closet i dont know how many years
lie aint worn it hell never wear it
again because hes too fat it wont fit
him ill risk it and give it to you

   madam i thank you from the bot-
tom of my heart i will retire to the
shed and change

  lie did and with the old ragged
oat  his arm and clad in the rusty
but warm corduroy he bowed his thanks
again and continued his way along the
road

  but one meal doesnt last forever
there were places along the highway
where he found no one at home he
might have broken in to meal but no
such thought ever came to his mind

  there were places where dogs were
in sigh and they showed an unwarrant-
ed antipathy to him so he trudged on
he threw away the ragged coat it
was a useless encumbrance

  mile after mile he traveled he grew
thirsty and hungry again he had
been thirsty and hungry and cold so


the argosy

many hours before ho had mrt with the
hospitable mrs koppercrust that one
mealhad not fortified him

   he felt his knees growing weaker
 he realized that he must have rest but
 rest in that biting cold was impossible
 and he did not feel so hopeless about the
 future as to want to die

   his step begun to wabble he even
 staggered and just as he was about
 to turn into another gateway hours and
 hours after he left amos koppercrusts
 he fell against the gate post

   a small dog came and sniffed at him
 and then retiring to a perfectly safe dis-
 tance set up a fearful yelping in a
 few minutes women came to the door of
 the little house

   and this leads up to the necessity of
 introducing mrs clip she was a
 widow she was the sister of amos
 koppercrust she was very poor

  when samantha koppercrust had
married josiah clip the world looked
bright indeed

   lie had the little farm he was a
 hard working and frugal man but the

 grim destroyer seems sometimes to love
 hard working and frugal men so she
 was left a widow without children and
 a small farm encumbered by a mortgage
 held by her ungenerous brother amos

   by the time mrs clip got to the gate
 ringbottom lay across the path uncon-
 scious

    gracious goodness what shall i
 do she asked herself aloud

 she hud no hired man she and a
woman servant tried to work the little
place getting the plowing and other
heavy work done when it was needed by
hiring somebody not permanently em-
ployed she called this person now

   there was no one else in sight she
 could see the long undisturbed line of
 the canal but not even a canal-boni was
 afloat navigation had closed for the
 winter she looked up the road and
 down the road none to help

    this poor man has fainted die
 said  weve got to get him in the
 house somehow

    hes nothin but a tramp said the
 other

    i dont think he looks like a tramp
 he is some poor man out of work i
 know he isnt a tramp look at the

 coat he wears my brother amos used
 to wear a corduroy coat like that
 tramps dont wear em

  so they dragged ringbottom to the
door and managed to get hint inside

  when lie recovered consciousness the
savor of gruel made him open his eyes
and see stars

  he was lying on a comfortable old-
fashioned lounge his cont was gone
and the shabby remnant of a vest he
had worn was also missing a warm
blanket covered him and a good-looking
woman sat waiting for him to wake up

   ive made you some gruel she said
 you fell you know right at my gate
i aint rich but i wouldnt turn a
hungry dog away and now you must
rest and get well there arc two women
here im a widow and jane ann has
been a widow twice wc aint afraid
and you dont look so very dangerous
now tnkc some of this and go to sleep
again

  was it a dream was this thing that
had happened to him real ringbottom
didnt know

  he looked around the room it was
cozy it was warm real chairs to sit
on around a real table

  pictures-old-fashioned perhaps but
real were on the walls

  he louked at the stove and saw real
fire

  it couldnt be a dream he remem-
bered tramping the weary miles till every
step seemed like putting his fool into a
blazing furnace he remembered turn-
ing in at the gateway he remembered
feeling dizzy

  it wasnt a dream

  while he ate the gruel he looked at
the widow she was certainly comely
she wore a cheap but well-fitting gown
then jane ann came bustling in

  there was no reason why mrs clip
should be afraid while jane ann was in
the house to ringbottom she looked
like a prize-fighter

   well have leg of lamb and some
of them peas and pumpkin-pic said
mrs clip  and make the coffee good
and hot

  once more ringbottom asked himself
if he was dreaming but the odors that
came from the kitchen reassured him
he was left alone and went to sleep
tie coat of amos koppercrust



  when at last he awoke refreshed
feeling something akin to a man dinner
was ready

   do you think you can sit up and
cat asked the widow

  could he could timothy ringbot-
tom bit up and eat could a man who
had tramped and starved and thirsted
and ridden in freiglu-cars and slept in
woods sit up in that room and cat

  he almost howled

   ive mended your coat said the
widow  i guess when you fell you
tore the lining just like a straight cut
with a knife but its all right now

   thanks said ringbottom

    its all rignt she said again  im
honest

  ringbottom was honest too but he
was hungry he sat down and began
active work on what jane ann put be-
fore him

  mrs clip looked nt him in surprise
as though she wondered why he had paid
so little attention to her remark

   now madam said ringbottom
when he had finished  i cannot tell
you in mere words how grateful i am
 am not yet of course as strong as 
will be after a meal or two more and
 feel that i cannot continue my tramp
without them ill make a bargain with
you you have said you were not afraid
there is no reason why you should be
 am just now a tramp but if i get a
chance to do honest work ill do it hard
enough to make it hurt

   you have a farm you have no
man to work it there must be a room
somewhere in the barn or wagon house
where i can sleep ill work for you
for my board i am not despondent
i want work but somehow when work
sees me coming it sneaks how about
it

   why- as for the food-you are wel-
come and goodness knows theres
work enough to do and there is a room
over the wagon-shed where a hired man
slept when my husband was alive

   then its a bargain permit me to
retire now ill take a look around and
get to work

  he walked out mrs clip and jane
ann looked at each other

  wetll did you ever jane ann
exclaimed

    a

  it was astonishing what things ring
bottom who had never done much of
anything could do remarkably well

  jane ann viewed him with an ad-
miration born of long disdain for ordi-
nary men

  as his appetite was great so was his
strength neither of the women had to
go out in the cold to do work

  he milked took care of the horse
whitewashed the henhouse got out the
democrat wagon and painted that
brought all the water from the well and
stood ready at all times to do whatever
june ann asked

  and all the time the blue eyes of mrs
clip looked at him peculiarly and won-
deringly

   well said ringbottom after a
week or so had passed  i have par-
taken of your hospitality long enough
 am well and strong i can go on now
and find work

   land sakes said jane ann
aint they work enough here

   but i must work for a living and
not encroach on hospitality

  but said mrs clip timidly we
-you see-weve got sort of accustomed
to having you around its made it real
easy for jane ann and me hasnt it
jane ann

   icasy seems like a picnic

   and- was thinking continued
the good-looking widow  ive been a
strugglin ever since my husband died
my brother is mean nnd wont help me
ita awful hard to pay the interest on
the mortgage and its leap year it
aint like as if i was a young girl a
widow knows her own mind and has
privileges and jane ann has been a
widow twice and she says im right

   weve talked it over so now
youve worked on the farm and its been
easy for us and im going to propose to
you will you marry me and stay and
be as good as youve been

  ringbottom sat perfectly still wrcre
these real words he thought he heard
was this pleasant voice some phantas-
magoria of a disordered brain was he
really out of his head

  or had he really been living in rlover
since he fell at the widows gate

   you seem surprised said mrs
clip  but you know its leap-year


the argosy

   so it i said ringbottom

  visions floated before him he had
never really had a chance he had
never had a home

  thrown out into this grateful world
we all know so well when he was nine
years old he had battled starved thirst-
ed and tramped till now sometimes
having work and other times an empty
atomach

  here was a farm hr could twosk and
make money on he knew it only want-
ed a man with energy and some brains
and god knew hed starved long enough
to be willing to furnish the energy

  here was a pleasant home with every
thing to make him comfortable with
jane ann to do the housework and a
good-looking woman who would be hit
lifes companion

  tears came to the fellows eyes

  mrs clip he said  dont know
what to say i am nothing but a tramp
why you ask me to marry you when you
must know plenty of better men i cant
imagine let me be honest with you 
do like you  like your home  am
grateful  could make money on the
farm is it possible that you want to
marry me 

   i have asked you i wouldnt ask
if  didnt mean it and you are not a
common tramp and i know it so there
you are fooling all the time if you
agree well get married

   manthy ill do it

   harness the horse said the widow
jumping to her feet and giving jane
ann a look that meant things   must
tell my brother

  the horse was harnessed somehow
ringbottom felt so light-beaded and
light-footed that he had to take a firm
hold on the earth to keep from floating
away but he got the horse harnessed
and the happy widow drove off

  amos koppercrust sat in his office
looking over some papers it was in-
terest-day for his sister it was always
interest day in amos koppercrusts of-
fice for some one

  but mrs clip was usually a few days
late and amos frowned

  lie looked surprised and pleased how-
ever when he saw her enter

   huh i  he said roughly  on time
for once eh 

   no amos she said  i came to
tell you about the interest im going
to pay it but i cant do it to-day im
going to ix married and then ill pay
it

   going to be-going to be married 
you going to be married who you go-
ing to marry  

   a man named timothy ringbot-
tom

   a fine name that bvit what about
the interest whos he anyhow when
you going to pay the interest  

   amos she said with a sweet smile
 ill tell you something the day-or
almost the day after im married well
pay you the interest and the mortgage 

  amos gasped he leaned bac k in his
chair and stared

   whercd you meet him he asked

   oh he came along the right man
always does

  amos woke up

   manthy  congratulate you on your
good fortune of course ill wait i
was never impatient about the interest
anyhow take your time and bring
timothy up to the house

   well come and see you she said
and was soon driving homeward the
happiest woman in the world

  she was shy and happy at the supper
table

  manthy said timothy its cold

as blazes in that wagon-shed as long
as wc are going to get married lets go
ahead

   well go this evening

  and they did mrs clip dragged
from some closet a pair of trousers and
a vest that belonged to her late husband
and also a black frock coat

   youd better wear these timothy
she said

  in the hopelessly dazed condition he
was in timothy would have put on any-
thing she told him she took his cor-
duroy coat and carefully looked it in a
closet

   you wont need any of your money
she said  ive got enough to pay the
minister

  anything went now timothy hadnt
seen any money in so long a time that
he scarcely recognized the name but
they went to the ministers and returned
mr and mrs timothy ringbottom
this coat of amos koppercrust

  there she laughed gleefully
when the horse had been fed and blan-
keted and watered for the night the
stable-door locked and the chicken-
house mode secure  you old rogue
you thought youd lool me you
thought youll win me without letting
me know oh youre a sly boots

   win you-without letting you know
 dont understand- always told you
the truth didnt i  

   i dont say you ever told me a lie
but i found it when i mended the tear
in your coat and i think now were
married and you can make the farm

gage

  the mortgage pay the mortgage
use what floundered the perplexed
timothy

  timothy ringbottom im your law-
fully wedded wife you cant fool inc
i saw it i counted it ill show you

  with a gay laugh she rushed away
and brought the corduroy coat a
swift cut of the scissors ripped the lining
again

   there  slie cried

  and timothy ringbottom almost fell
in another fit when jie flashed a roll of
bank-notes in his face

  oh yes youre a tramp you are
two thousand good dollars tramp
huh why the mortgage is only five
hundred

  timothy passed ids palsied hand over
bis brows

  was-was that-inthe coat

  of course

   all right well go see your brother
to-morrow

   didnt you know it was in the coal
what makes you so white

   nothing only  was thinking of
something well go sec your brother
to-morrow id lieen so happy i forgot
the money

  amos koppercrust was indeed pleased
to see bis sister and her husband the fol-
lowing day

    suppose you intend to be married
soon he said before he had got it
through bis head that they were already
man and wife

   amos koppercrust said ringbot
tom  let me talk to you as a man 
am married to your sister  was tramp-

ing to new york to look for work and
was hungry and cold and ill clothed i
stopped at a house on the road-your
house - and your wife gave me food
my coat was ragged and in the kindness
of her heart she gave me a coat of yours
-an old corduroy coat

   what t that-

   stop a minute i didnt know there

she said that you bad money in hiding
from her  dont know why you had

pay lend me fifteen hundred of this
money and let me take up the mort-
gage with the other five hundred ill

hundred a year till the debt is paid

  amos koppercrust sat and looked
there was the money timothy king
bottom held it in his hand

could have kept it said timothy  but
i never took a dollar dishonestly yet
though iod knows ive needed it
youve worked for money youve made

gret it remember - could have kept

  a spasm swept over the facc of amos
koppercrust

and didnt have time to go to new
york and didnt want my wife to know
about it shes extravagant

                  an artist in difficulties how a friend tried to help him out
                  and the part played by his pet antipathy in the process

synopsis of chapters previously published

    a young artist dick walters i temporary financial straits is threatened with
eviction in case he cannot at once raise forty dollars for ins rent returning to itis room
disheartened after an unsuccessful attempt to borrow money he is informed by his
friend conner a fellow artist that the beautiful and eccentric actress mine burnham
has been there to order a portrait done conner offers walters his own studio for the
work

    the marshal and the landlord meanwhile disregarding a stay of execution which
walters has secured from his friend masters a lawyer move dicks furniture out into
the street and follow it with some of conners the artists appeal to a policeman who
befriends them until the landlord abrams accuscs them of running a gambling-place in
his house and produces as proof a roulette-wheel and a faro layout upon this the
policeman takes walters and conner into custody

chapter vi

 keep a movin

sternly the big officer led the
two up the street even the
nimble witted conner was too dazed to
think of anything to say occasionally
he tried to trap the policeman into con-
versation but the man only turned a
stony countenance upon him and glared
him into crestfallen silence

  walters was too crushed to do any-
thing but meekly follow without a word

  just when lie was in the very black-
est depths of despair their captor turned
them abruptly into a little hallway

    now he cried beat it quick ill
give ye an hour t get yer junk oil th
street an if it aint gone by then ill
have t telephone the public obstruction
people and have it taken to their yard

   but  dont understand walters
-stammered  arent you going to ar-
rest us after all

  of course not ive bad me oiyc on
th little feller since ive been on th
beat an i know where he got th junk
he brought down-stairs but  aint ready
fer a raid yet we want t get him
strong so he cant slip out

   but if you knew he was running a
gambling-joint why did you humiliate

rtfm october akcost

us to the extent of arresting us in pub-
lic conner demanded indignantly

   oi did me best fcr ycz the fellow
earnestly assured them  but if oid
ha let on like oi knew anything
abrams would ha elosed up fer good
oi had t do it

   well i think its about up to you
to help us find a man to move our
things then conner demanded  we
cant get any utorage-men who will take
them at this hour in the night

   ill show ye a man who hauls ice
and coal lie lives in a little alleyway
around the corner ill roust him out

  a stranger would never have suspected
that any one lived in the little cut-in
where they now went walters shud-
dered at the temerity of the policeman
as he viciously pounded with his club
on the door that first presented itself

   is this where he lives he queried

   sure an oi dont know the offi-
cer replied indifferently  but its
somcwhcrcs around here ill soon find
out and he redoubled his hammering

  the artist said no more this dis-
play of thoughtfulness on the part of
their newly found friend made him more
than ever grateful that they had en-
listed his sympathies instead of an-
tagonizing him

a faii out of fate



  finally a head was thrust from ft
window and a very irritated voice de-
manded to know who came at that un-
seemly hour fortunately it chanced
that the italian in question had a room
there and rented the cellar for his ice

  a very frightened little man was
finally rousted out and acknowledged
under pressure that he was sometimes
willing to do odd jobs of the kind
mentioned-but never at such an hour
of night

   come tony -get busy and pitch
into th job the cop cheerfully re-
quested paying no heed to his protests

   i no hava da time  gctta da
sleep makka da mon no gctta da
sleep loosa da mon tony getti da
bed suiting the action to the word
the italian was turning his back upon
them and almost succeeded in closing
the door when the cop put his foot in
the way

  tonyi the italian looked up in
alarm at the ring of command in the
officers voice  get yer cart and bring
the things here  do ycz understand  

  lie bent over and whispered some-
thing in the mans car and the little
fdlow with a frightened expression on
his face hastily acquicsccd and shortly
reappeared struggling with his coat

   i getta da things he promised  i
taka dcm here tilla da man call

   he says translated the policeman
that he will get them but a storage-
man must call for them

  they left the italian as he was com-
ing out of the cellar with his little push-
cart and strolled out of the alley

   what did you say to him that made
him change his mind so suddenly  
conner queried

   told him that i was gettin curious
about that license o his the policeman
explained  most all these eyetalians
are usin th first licenses they ever got
we dont bother wid them much except
in case of an emergency

   dont forget boys the policeman
said in parting have a storage-man
call first thing in the morning

  conner looked at walters and walters
looked at conner when they had seen
the mans burly figure disappear around
the corner  now what are we going
to do they tried in a breath

  it was truly a situation to tax the in-
genuity of the most resourceful in the
first place they must get a lodging for
the night secondly walters must some-
how manage to steer mine burnham
away from the ex studio in the morning
find still not antagonize her to such an
extent as to lose the order thirdly how
could he with no money or tangible
means of support obtain a place to
paint her portrait and still have it the
manner of studio that would suit her
fickle fancy all these things put his
head in a whirl just to think of them

   well i guess wed better be look-
ing sharp or we wont find a place to
put up for the niglu conner suggested
 everything has turned out very nice-
ly hasnt it he added with a cheer-
ful grin

  beautifully walters groaned
 in fact i dont see how they could
well le much worse

   nonsense his friend scoffed
 take your own case for instance
suppose this had happened when madam
was sitting to you dont you suppose
she would have thrown over the whole
thing and even if she hadnt you
couldnt have done good work with the
thing preying on your mind now youre
absolutely care-free

   if you find a place youll be all
right till you can finish the portrait
and all you have to do to find a plce
is o go out and look for it he that
is down need fear no fall its the
truest saying of them all

   well thats one way of looking at
it waltcru agreed  now it seems to
me the best thing to do is for us to
separate and look for rooms ive done
you enough damage for one night

  conner regarded him reproachfully

   and do you think that im going
to let you look for a place and leave
me out   he cried

   come conner own up that im only
a drag on you youre mighty kind but
i know there arc lots of fellows that
can lake one in who cant find room
for two

   why what are you talking about
wnltcrs you dont suppose were
going any place but a hotel do you
it wont be a week before youll be a
plutocrat my boy do you actually


this argosy

 mean to say that you-the printer of
 mmc burnham-thought of going any-
 where else

    not yet conner walters had to
 laugh in spite of his gloom at the un-
 flagging optimism of hts friend

   here lie was in the most hopeless
 situation possible to imagine-without a
 roof to cover him-and conner seemed
 to find great consolation in the fact that
 abrams could never dispossess them
 again

   it was but a short walk to the great
 lights that glaringly indicated a hotel
 and conner made for it at a rate of
 speed that made il difficult for his friend
 to keep pace with him

     ior heavens sake dont tackle that
 place wallers implored him  why
 man thats the prince anil well never
 be able to pay the bill in the world

- dont you know that it is the most ex-
 pensive hotel in the city

    the besi is always the cheapest in
 the long run was the only answer he
 got  besides its the little fellows
 that are all the time looking out for
 the pennies they think everybody is
 trying to beat them

    all right the artist capitulated
 with a sigh

   only when he was thoroughly annoyed
 at the snickers of laughter that seemed
 directed at them did he notice that con-
 ner in the excitement of moving had
 ffiled to change his coat and was still
 attired in his painting jacket a soiled
 and paint bespattered garment indeed

   humiliated in the extreme be still
 followed blindly and approached the
 desk a very tired looking clerk turned
 as they approached and eyed conner
 suspiciously

     well my man he superciliously in-
 quired  what can i do for you didnt
 you see the sign at the side of the hotel
 - employees entrance

   conner straightened up with a wither-
 ing glance at the man which changed
 his attitude to one of perplexity there
 was something about conner that would
 have compelled courtesy from everybody
 even if he had been dressed in a bath-
 robe

   what can i do for you the clerk
 repeated in a far different tone from the
 one which he bad just used

   my friend and i wish two rooms
and a bath conner requested

   on which floor would you prefer
them the man inquired politely still
scanning his strange guest with a puz-
zled expression

   any floor will do the irishman
easily returned  ill have my trunks
sent around to-morrow some time will
you have the boy show us the rooms
right away   he added

   certainly sir the man was all
alacrity now  it will be fifteen dol-
lars a day sir shall i start your bill
before the luggage arrives

  it was a hint that was impossible to
ignore and walters almost had palpita-
tion of the heart before the ready-witted
irishman not one whit abashed reached
down in the pocket which he knew held
not a cent and drew his hand forth with
an expression of dismay that would have
done credit to any actor

  hurriedly he scurried through his
trousers and finally after finding them
empty reached into his coat and then
collapsed

  it took him fully a moment to re-
cover from his mortification then with
a crestfallen expression he looked for
relief to his companion

   why dick i  he cried  ive left
all my money in my other clothes how
in the world did you ever allow me to
go out in my painting-jacket  

  he turned to the clerk with a pro-
pitiating smile

   im sure i beg your pardon but my
friend and  are both artists and
naturally forget little things that most
people remember i believe some call
it the artistic temperament it is most
annoying but  will have to ask you to
postpone settlement of the bill until to-
morrow morning

   we would be very glad to accom-
modate you mr- mr-

   conner

  -mr conner but we have the most
explicit instructions to demand payment
in advance from guests arriving after
six oclock without baggage i dont
doubt for an instant of course that
everything is all right but wc are al-
lowed to make no exceptions

   but surely conner protested  you
will be willing to wait till tomorrow
a fall out of fate



   i wish i might if the proprietor
was here i nm urc he would say it was
all right hut if wc wore allowed to use
our own discretion we might make a
blunder it would be impossible for us
to recoup

   but what shall i do 

   i am allowed the responsibility of
accepting your check the man cour-
teously suggested

   hut i left my check book at home
also

   that can be remedied in a moment
i will get you a blank one from the
cashier

  walters gasped after all the blulting
his friend had done how was he going
to side-step gracefully such a generous
offer 

   no that would be quite impossible
conner retorted rather sharply  really
i am quite put out about this of
course i dont wish to lose track of my
check numlers the way i should once
 got in the habit of doing this

  instead of answering back the clerk
became more fearful than ever of turn-
ing them away

   couldnt  send a boy around for
a suit-case   he suggested  that
would quite answer the purpose

  walters recalled the jumble his fur
niture must he in in company with the
coal and ice products of the son of
italy and in alarm pulled at his
friends coat-tails

  conner took the hint and turned a
glowering face toward the unhappy
clerk

   most certainly not he snarled
if it has come to a pass when a gen-
tleman has to tote a suit-case to prove
hes a gentleman then  dont care to
stop at a hotel where that is the way
they treat prospective guests why -
and he laughed bitterly as he turned to
vvaltcrs- i expect next they will have
the maid make an inventory of what
clothing we have to see if there is enough
to meet the bill

   no thank you and he bowed
witheringly to the clerk  i dont care
for the rooms i countermand them
jiow

  conner turned and motioned his
friend to follow and despite the almost
frantic efforts of the bewildered clerk

to propitiate them they stalked haughtily
from the place conner muttering about
the  outrage  as he went

  well of all the unmitigated gall i
walters looked at his friend in the
keenest admiration once they were well
out of sight of the placc  who on
earth do you think you nrc that poor
fellow supposes he has turned down the
main prop of the hotel and you with
that filthy old jacket on 

   yes this coat does complicate the
situation somewhat conner gazed rue-
fully down at the garment in question
 in fact unless we can get a suit case
out of that hodge-podge i dont very
well see what we can do do you sup-
pose we can find one

   well you can the artist replied
hastily  but i wouldnt go within a
mile of that little italian and wake him
up again to-night for a hundred suit-
cases

   theres something in that too the
irishman thoughtfully muttered  in
fact my hoy i see very plainly where
we stroll away the hours twixt now and
dawn as the poets say and subsist on
beaming fancies of what the morrow has
to bring forth

   you mean wc will stay up all night
outdoors walters cried incredulously
 why ill be too dead in the morning
to think of anything to do much less
do it

  come come its a lot better than
being in the prince and not being able
to get the money to move theres
nothing in the world so deadly to the
nerves of a man as to sit and sec a bill
he is absolutely unable to pay growing
at a rate that would make the erecting
of a sky-scraper look sick

   and what are we going to do in
the morning id like to know wal-
ters demanded  ive got to telephone
masters and see if he cant tell me that
they couldnt possibly put me out and
make me walk the streets all night
then get that stuff moved way from
the icemans and next ill have to
steer muie burnham away from the
studio after that- and he waved his
arms in a gesture of hopelessness

   lets go over in the park and it
down while we talk it over his friend
suggested


tiie argosy

   rut well catch cold bitting down
in this weather and besides im com-
pletely worn out id fall asleep sure

   not for long enough to catch much
of a cold or anything else conner re-
torted with a peculiar look

   now conner the artist questioned
once they were seated on a bench in the
park  how am  going to get anything
to do to-morrow that will permit me
to paint that portrait lls hard enough
to got a job where you can work all
day but to find a place where the work
will lc light enough to permit me to
do other work is a facer

   the first thing in the consideration
of that question is to make a list of the
things that arc night work now theres
waiting on a table-have you ever waited
in a restaurant  

   not in the way you refer to wal-
ters replied with a sinking heart

  had he comc to a consideration of
such a thing was it possible that this
was he listening to the possibilities of
getting a job as a waiter

   well that requires some experience
at any rate still if you could carry
five glasses without dropping one of
them you might have a chance in a
saloon theres not many tips there but
you get all you want to eat well 
guess that knocks the wailing chances
out its too bad conner sighed  my
boy your education hasbeen sadly neg-
lected every child should be taught to
wait at table it is a position where
there is always an opening and not half
bad

   do you mean to say that you have
been a waiter   walters cried in amaze-
ment

   certainly you dont suppose 
would let a chance like that slip do
you perhaps i may have served you-
who knows he added whimsicaiy
have you ever tried  barkin for
one of those side-shows down c  four-
teenth street now that s a trifle
more genteel than the other but the
work is a bit more wearing and be-
sides your voice needs a thorough course
of cultivation

    be serious  the artist protested

   serious  never was more serious
in my life its easy work the hours
are short and i know theres a place

 where they need a man badly they pay
 ten dollars a week for a new man and
 that would be sufficient to keep up your
 rent until you finished the portrait
 thats all youll need the food will
 take care of itself

    all right then if you know of a
 place where theres a sure opening
 walters consented sadly  i guess my
 voice will answer the requirements i
 had it cultivated for five years so i can
 make plenty of noise

  hey keep a movin there a
 prod in the ribs from a policemans
 night-stick brought walters abruptly
 back to the present re yu dead
 the ofticcr questioned sharply  get a
 wiggle on yu  

   ruefully the pafr strolled slowly out
 of the park and stood a moment at the
 exit

    ive often found it very pleasant to
 pass the time by taking a little stroll
 to the battery and back conner sug-
 gested

    im too dog-tired for it the
 ortist replied with a weary gesture
  conner i dont for the life of me
 nee how im going to do a thing to-
 morrow im completely fagged out

     you want to lie down anti sleep
 i know a fine place right over the way
 its not very stylish and the company
 isnt of the choicest but the air is fine
 his friend suggested that grating
 right behind the big building where the
 heat from the furnace coming through
 beats any blanket ever invented the
 rich litte know of the luxuries of the
 down and-out brigade he added

   what - with those poor devils
 walters shrank back as from a blow
  why theyre thieves and everything
 else he protested

   conner chuckled

    i know they would steal everything

	weve got but somehow or other it
 doesnt lxther me much all you have
 to do is to put your shoes under your
 head and that makes the only thing of
 value we possess safe as in a deposit-
 vault in the trust company

    i guess ill try the battery the
 artist sighed  now tell me about this
  barking  job he added

    my dear fellow do you mean to say
 you dont know what a barker is well
a kali out of fate

gob

youve seen those fellows down at coney
island who stand outside the side-shown
and make it their business to tell a mil-
lion lies about what going on inside
thats a barker a profession in which
i was in former years of somewhat high
repute step right up ladies and gents
the price is almost noth-lng  

   keep a movinl step lively there 
a grulf voice growled from behind them
at this point in conners interesting story
of his experience and once more walters
fell a prod in the rear

   well after this  wont linger any
more he declared  our next stop is
the battery

   to go on with the duties of the
barker conner continued as though he
had met with no interruption it is
just the place for a man of your abilities
think of it you wont be tired out
when you approach your work on the
portrait in the daytime and you will
be assured of your rent after that the
way will be easy i know its rough and
has many disadvantage but its better
than having one of those cops rubbing
it in on you that this is your moving
night

   but what is the show where they
have the vacancy walters inquired
 tell me all about it so that you can
teach me their lingo and equip me for
the position

   all right conner agreed  i used
to be with them so i can give you my
old spiel

  heedful of the lesson the second

fkoliceman bail taught them he lowered
tis voice so that it would not be heard
by any one in the vicinity but it still
had traces of the showman expert in the
business of attracting the public

  behold behold behold  tadies
and gentlemen the wonder of the ages
the fiercest fighting animal the world
has ever seen  he eats but once a day
he sleeps but once a week he doea not
know the touch of human hand behold
-behold-the five legged animal with
two heads behold the cat of- why
whats the matter he suddenly broke
off as his companion gave vent to a
dismal groan whats up

   a cat  walter groaned dismally
 man alive  would never live to fin-
ish that portrait if i had anything to

do with a cat while i was about it
cats are bad luck to me i cant take
the job

chapter vii

succor

   now dont be foolish  conner
broke out  your nerves are upset or
you wouldnt think of letting a little
thing like such a fool notion stand in
the way of all your chances 

   foolish or not the artist soberly
replied  im in mortal terror of tack-
ling anything connected in any way with
cats theyve seemed to haunt me all
my life i never could draw one and
the teachers in the art school made my
life a burden trying to coach it into me
why just to-night as i was coming
home feeling assured that nothing on
earth could keep me out of my studio
a big black cat came prancing out of
a doorway and marched along with me
i firmly believe that if  hadnt spotted
that cat i would be in my studio now

i	know it sounds ridiculous but its a
feeling i cant got over

   if you feel that way about it i
guess its no use talking conner
sighed

  but what are we going to do now  
walters groaned  oh hang it all old
man i dont believe i ever will get a
chance to paint her

   dont lose heart dick theres lot
of other jobs waiting the thing to do
is to pick out just one of them and nail
it besides i dont believe youd have
made good as a barker after all you
lack something for such an elevated pro-
fession

   a minute ago you thought id be
ideal for the place walters laughed
 well think of something quick

   couldnt you manage to sell one of
your pictures if you were willing to let
it go cheap

  walters groaned again

   why conner if i did manage to
sell one they wouldnt let me have the
money for at least two weeks the last
place i went to was that new maga-
zine the editor looked it over said
he liked it very much and would be
willing to pay five dollars for it  was
cgg

the argosy

so frightfully hard up that i was going
to take it when the generous fellow
announced that he would mail me a
check on publication

   tough luck   conner agreed  hut
didnt you tell me you were doing a
story with that fellow banks if hes
as good as he says he is and has such
a strong pull with the editors why dont
you take him with you and make him
sell one out cheap tell him that youll
do his next story for nothing if he will
make a sale

   i never thought of him before and
a great light dawned upon the artist

	well go up right away and see him
then we can stay all night where its
warm

  conner slapped him enthusiastically
on the shoulder

  its a fine head youve got boy i
come along to your friend - the cele
brated hanks but will he stand for
it   he queried a sudden revulsion of
feeling striking him  its an awful
imposition you know

   stand for it  walters cried with a
laugh  i should say he would hes
the strangest fellow about anything like
that he knows as little about artists
and their ways as  do about writers
you know i have devoted most all of
my time to painting for the exhibitions
well hes the greatest chap to study a
fellow  never seems to get mad at
anything you do

   he must be all right conner mut-
tered reflectively  it certainly was
good of him to take up your work the
way he did and boost it by making it
impossible to sell his story which in in
demand without your drawing which
isnt how far docs lie live from
here

   only a little way back in the old
washington square district the artist
replied hes a great fellow for at-
mosphere and all that sort of thing
got a studio with the most exquisite
tilings from all over the world you
know hes been sent on special stories
all around the globe by the magazines
and newspapers  must admit that for
myself if  had the money he makes
 would never live in one of those old
joints but have all the latest modern
improvements they could cram in

atmosphere is all right for a fellow
when lie isnt doing anything but dab-
bling  but for work give me comfort

   im thinking a joint on washington
square would be a blamed sight better
than the battery- even if i do miss my
before-breakfast constitutional retorted
conner

   well heres the place and youll
soon have a chance to see for your-
self

  walters looked up at the great dark-
ened building then went out in the
street and called at the top of his voice
banks-oh banks

   youve got a nerve i  conner
growled  heres his bell why dont
you ring it he never will let us in
after making all this racket

  a tousled head poked itself out of
the window and a peevish voice de-
manded to know what was the trouble

   ive got conner with me walters
cried  come on down and be so-
ciable

   cant do it the man replied cheer-
ily enough  but you come up wait
and ill let you in

  the window slammed shut and they
waited anxiously for the door to open
at last the man appeared in a most ex-
quisitely brocaded dressing - gown of
flowered pattern and dainty slippers on
his bare feet

  come on out with us walters
begged  were having a great time

   loo tired to-night boys come up
yourselves and stay a while

  for fear the invitation be withdrawn
conner stealthily inserted his fool in
the door-jamb

  after much effort walters was per-
suaded to accept the others hospitality
for  just a moment-understand and
they were soon in the authors room

  conner stretched himself out on
bankss couch and promptly began to
doze it was a place that betokened the
exotic in every way not a thing in it
that was of any earthly use except the
gaudily upholstered chairs

 whats up banks demanded
 you artists are the most eccentric lot
i ever met in all my travels

   weve been evicted walters calm-
ly icmarkcd and in nowise disturbed
by a kick on the shins from the aston-
a fau out of fate



ishcd conner he went on to elaborate
si talc that for beauty of imagination
would have done credit to a man of
even hankss reputation

  evicted the novelist cried glee
fully when the artist had finished  
must use that everything is grist that
comes to the writers mill lie added
apologetically   wish  could expe-
rience something like that once but
ive always been so devilishly popular
that i caht manage to spend all the
checks i get for my stuff now ill
submit that theme for a story to harry
right away

  harry who conner queried

   why harry truesdale-the editor
of the planet magazine dont you
know harry he cried in wonderment
 why harry just dotes on my stories

   then lies the man to take the one
i illustrated for you last week wal-
ters cried  by george old man i
need the money right away and hell
like the pictures  know they are
altogether in keeping with the spirit of
the story ill go with you first thing
in the morning and try to make a sale
i know the planets sort of material
and if those picture arent in line with
what tlvcy like im ready never to
touch a brush again can you get
away he added anxiously

   why certainly  always glad to help
a friend  dont see any reason in the
world why they should turn it down on
account of the pictures banks added
patronizingly

   well now thats settled  guess
i wont go out again walters stretched
himself luxuriously in a great rocker
just turn in old man whenever you get
ready say it was luck  thought of
coining around here

  it was only the work of a minute for
him to put aside all the trials and tribu-
lations of the day  how long he slept
he did not know for his dreams were
of a royal nature

  lianks woke him up with an air of
ill repressed excitement

   its all right walters lie cried
 i managed to get harry on the phone
at his house and make an engagement
for us before he took on any one else
but well have to hustle for he said it
was going to be a very busy day and

he had some other important people
coming to sec him whom it would be
unwise to delay i think it would be
best to run over to the office as soon
as we have a bite to cat and wait for
him so we can tackle him the instant
he gets down

  conner agreed as to the advisability
of this course and commented on the
others cxcitcmcnt

   youre like a boy with a new toy
he remarked

  banks drew himself up with dignity

  it is quite natural that i should lc
excited sir i am very much interested
in placing mr walters in n position
where he will be able to do a great
deal of my illustrating i like his work
as well as that of any one i have had
since poor smith died

  no offense conner hastened to
say  i was just thinking how lucky
the boy was to have such a man show
an interest in him

   but what arc we going to do about
keeping the madarnc away from that
studio if were going to the planet
office walters cried in sudden alarm
 can you telephone her conner that
i will call in the afternoon  

   sure if i can find out where she
lives

   you mean you dont know her ad-
dress the artist exclaimed in alarm

   why no i never thought to ask
her i dont know but that she might
have taken it for impertinence if i had
i never dreamed of being put out last
night

  whos that banks queried if
shes at all well known  might be
able to help you i am acquainted with
almost everybody of any consequence in
town

  walters tipped his friend with a sly
wink to be very careful what he said
as banks was something of a chatter-
box

   mine burnham we have an ap
pointment with her conner evasively
replied

   the superb burnham an appoint
ment with the glorious burnham
banks cried in amazement  will you
introduce me i have longed to meet
her for years but something has always
interfered


the argosy

   the fact is neither of us knows
her at all but the appointment wns
made yesterday and wc were to meet
her to-day as soon as we get at all
well acquainted we will speak about
it conner promised  do you hap-
pen to know her address

   why no that is i did know it
but have forgotten however my valet
may be familiar with it he has not
missed a performance sincc she has been
coming to this country in fact if i
am not mistaken he is one of the crowd
of frenchmen that drew her in her car-
riage from the theater to the hotel

  he rang the bell and his servant ap
peared at the door  francois do you
know at what hotel mine burnham is
stopping 

  the mans hand went up in the air
in gallic rhapsody

   ze burnham zc sublime- c di-
vine burnham i  he cried

   yes do you know where she is stop-
ping  walters cut in eagerly

  at c prince hotel the man re-
plied and was starting off in another
rhapsody when his master interrupted
him

   my friends have an appointment
with her and wished to know the address
as they had forgotten it

  with a backward glance of admiration
and awe at any one big enough to have
an appointment with ids idol the man
withdrew and they could see that banka
was a much bigger man to him than he
hod ever been before

   well conner do you think it would
make her angry if  should send you in
my place to make a later engagement
tell her that i have decidcd to have my
studio repapered i cant stand to work
in the light it gives doesnt that sound
eccentric enough to suit her as a plausible
cxcuse 

  the irishman was on his feet in an
instant

   splendid  he cried  but  must
hurry before she gets out of the hotel
it looks a lot better for you not to ap-
pear too eager j say that your work has
prevented your coining yourself

  he turned with a humorous twinkle in
his eye

    hope the t same clcrk is on duty
 wonder what ic will say when he sees

me being ushered to the burnhams apart-
ments 

   change your coat first walters
laughingly suggested  borrow one of
banks and dont forget to telephone
the storage people

   ive done that long ago its all
right he cried exultantly slipping into
one of the coats which the eager banks
was holding for him  ill beard the
burnham in her den i i-conner   lie
cried dashing madly out of the room

chapter viii

a waterloo

   you might have sent me the author
remarked as they heard the down-stairs
door slam  conners a fine chap and
all that but hes rather rough in his man-
ner dont you think it might have
been better to have a well-known man
call on the madamc than an obscure
artist no one has ever heard of you
know i said i wanted to meet her

  walters looked at him in amazement
was it possible that the novelist was
jealotis of conner being allowed to act
in the capacity of errand boy for him

   but we could not have kept your en-
gagement with mr truesdale if you had
gone he objected

   thats so the fellow replied
blushing  well it wouldnt have been
the first time ive broken dates with
him he blustered recovering himself
 he cant afford to lose me for such a
trifling thing as that

   but i tell you i want to get the
money to-day the artist protested

  oh yes banks said thoughtfully
 well wed better be going

  all the way to the planet ofiicc dicks
heart was beating like a trip-hammer
what if after all bin work should not
be satisfactory was the one thought that
obsessed him suppose with all ids ex-
perience banks had let his enthusiasm
run away with his critical judgment
he was apt to do that walters knew
that some of his ideas of art were ab-
surd

  however it was impossible that his
pictures should be so badly done as to
be turned down surely truesdale
would not dare offend banks to such an
a fall out of fate

g

extent no he was foolish to worry
even for an instant about the possibility
of failure

  at inst they stopped in front of a
great building which seemed to the artist
to have a million frowns in every square
foot of it ilia companion bustled him
into the elevator with such confidence
that he called himself all manner of a
fool to be frightened over a thing which
he had gone through alone a score of
times

  banks spoke very familiarly to the ele-
vator man as they stepped into the oar
and walters was considerably surprised
to observe that the salutation was not re-
turned with any great degree of enthu-
siasm but merely acknowledged with an
indiffefcmt nod of the head

  as they got off at the top of the sky-
scraper the artist found his nervousness
intensified by the fact thatinstead of
having a chance to regain his composure
they stepped immediately into a great
room filled with books behind a rail-
ing were scattered numberless desk
with the name of the person occupying
it tackcd on the side

  books-books - books - the publica
tions of the firm were everywhere

  banks seemed to feel perfectly at
home and pointed out certain notables
behind the railing-notables dick
thought ho did not at all resemble the
sketches and photograph he had seen of
them

  the novelist made it a point to bow
to every man tbat raised his eyes from
his work and looked in their direction
it was mighty reassuring to walters to
observe tbat they all returned the salu-
tation rather distantly of course but
what could be expected in a big office of
this kind where every one was working
like mad

  the writei approached a very pretty
girl seated jus inside the railing and
inquired if mr truesdalc had come
down yet

   were expecting him any minute
now she replied with a hasty glance at
the big clock in one corner of the room

   yes i have an appointment with
him nt this hour banks informed her
 i cant understand his being late

  tie just telephoned and said to hold
mr ilopkinson if he should come but

lie never mentioned you mr banks the
girl remarked

   strange i  the authors brow puck-
ered thoughtfully  however i told
him  would wait

  he seated himself comfortably on the
great couch that ran around the enclo-
sure and lit a cigarette

  at tbat moment a scholarly white- 
haired man stepped briskly in at the door
and with a quick glance about hastened
toward the swinging gate

  there he is walters clutched his
companions arm in his hand with a
nervous grip  catch him before he
gets in that pen

  it seemed to him as if should trues-
dalc once get to his desk nothing could
ever reach him-especially such an an-
noying personage as an artist

  oh mr truesdale  and banks
planted himself firmly before the editor
just a moment please

  has mr hopkinson been in yet
truesdalc inquired of the girl quite
ignoring banks  no when be calls
will you kindly ask him to step back to
my desk  

   mr truesdale and bankss voice
was much more respectful toward
harry than walters had imagined it
could be to any one  i wished to sec
you for a moment

  oh banks the utter weariness
with which the editor recognized the
author made the artists heart sink like
lead well what is it now banks

   a manuscript sir that-

   very well ill send it back -or
rather ill read it within the month

  he held out his hand for the docu-
ment and then for the first time noticed
the big bundle of pictures under bankss
arm

  whats this he demanded

   some drawings to illustrate the
story which mv friend mr walters
did

  banks hauled forward the diffident
artist and introduced him

  the editor grasped his hand warmly

   very glad to meet you sir he said
in such a sincere tone that walters knew
in a moment that what he had feared
was indifference of manner was merely
his little joke with banks  have you
ever submitted any work here


the argosy

   no sir but i have mndc a cnrcful
study of the style you seem to like in
your magazine dick responded will
you tell me what you think of them now
sir he queried

  the editor hesitated an instant and
was lost for the ready banks remarked
casually  perhaps you may have
seen mr walterss work in seamons
he hat been exhibiting there the past
week  

   why no  dont believe  remem-
ber however since you wish it i
will be very glad to give you my opinion
immediately

  he led them through the bewildering
maze of desk to the last one in the ex-
treme end of the room and hospitably
drew up a couple of chairs before seat-
ing himself carefully untying the
string around the drawings he deliber-
ately laid them upon the desk

   now young man he began  im
going to tell you exactly what  think
of your work if you dont want me to
you may take them away at once 
warn you that  am called a harsh critic
and nobody knows any better than i how
much the truth hurts at times do you
still want me to look at them

   yes sir walters tremblingly ac-
quiesced

   very well he turned over the
first one

  it was a marine and represented a
man holding on to a life preserver in the
midst of a boiling sea mountains of
waves rose all over the background and

in a little hollow rested a miniature ship
-dwarfed into nothingness by the
mighty ocean

  the editor frowned studied the pic
turc carefully and without a word of
comment passed to the next it was an-
other of very mutii the same type and
this one was also passed after a careful
scrutiny

  the third was a scene on the breton
coast and was bandied with great fidel-
ity in costume and so on 

  the editor smiled

   when were you last in brittany
mr walters lie inquired

   last year dick replied his heart
bounding with hope as he saw that the
man had recognized the scene lt was
a commonplace enough subject and he

had not even taken the trouble to give
it a caption

   i like that mr truesdale said
very simply

  walters turned with a triumphant
smile to banks

   i told you that one was all right
he whispered  and what do you
think of the others he inquired

  execrable the editor replied with
a smile that disarmed the criticism of
harshness  the figures arc unnat-
ural and the waves are altogether out of
thg general color scheme- in fact i can-
not cohceive how the same man could
have made the three drawings

   but i followed my text carefully
sir the artist remonstrated  every
detail is as the story laid it out for me
the editor turned to banks

  have you the manuscript he in-
quired  ah here we have it  and he
scanned the typed pages carefully a mo-
ment following with one finger the
painting of the unhappy artist

   i beg your pardon mr walters he
said  you have followed the story

  then you will take them dick
cried all his spirits reviving

   i very much doubt it however i
will let you know as soon as  read the
manuscript

   but wont you read it now if the
pictures arc satisfactory  co  use the
money to the greatest advantage at the
present moment

   i think it would be quite impossible
it would hardly be fair to other and
older contributors

    but really sir if you understood the
situation you-

   my dear mr walters the editor re
plied  i dont believe there is a single
situation that  dont understand i was
a free-lance writer for a good many years
before i undertook the editorship of this
magazine but  can tell you quite
frankly that you may as well tear up the
two  first looked at they follow the
story as you say and-

   you mean you dont wish my story 
cried banks bristling

   my dear mr banks i have told you
for the last ten years that your style was
absolutely unsuitable to our publication

i	dont believe from -vliat i saw of the
pictures that i wish the story
face value



   then we may as well go the in-
dignant writer gathered together the
sheets of his manuscript and started to
tie ti the illustrations

  walters stood irresolute undecided as
to yhat to do if the bottom of the earth
had dropped out he could not have been
more surprised than he was to hear of the
true standing llanks had in the estimation
of  harry

   you may leave the small one the
editor mildly requested  i would like
to talk with mr walters that is if he
has no objection to waiting a moment

   llut i dont understand at all dick
stammered as soon as the outraged author
had taken his blustering departure  he
told me that-

   that is what i asked you to remain
for the editor informed him  your
work is remarkably good mr walters
and i would like to see more of it wc
can use this kind of thing hut never
again allow an author to inveigle you
into doing work with him unless the
story is ordered we dont know whether

-no matter how good it may be-we
can use it you see a magazine must be
balanced different people want differ-
ent things and we must do our best to
give them variety even if the story is
accepted and the pictures satisfactory
the art manager or  might think a differ-
ent part of it needed illustrating or your
work might not suit the make-up of the
magazine page there are a thousand
little things that will show you the folly
of using your own judgment in this
mutter

   hut banks told me tliatr-

   my dear boy banks is a necessary
evil he is a braggart and a liar he has
never to my knowledge had a story
printed or even accepted he preys on
foolish artists who know nothing of him
in the vain hope that some day he may
strike one big enough to pull him through
the portals

   hut cant i sell you the little one
walters tried as a last resort

  it would be absolutely useless to us
the editor answered

to be continued

face value

dy george m a cain

a lucrative job that a college graduate tried his bet to declinc
and the strange position into wluch it finally brought him

 t yarn such a face anyhow

       wilbur wharton said it with
a good deal of vehemence he accom-
panied his words with a shaking of his
fist at the reflection he saw in the huge
mirror behind the tempting array of
viands in the window of a second-grade
restaurant

  he had just come out of another de-
partment store without securing a job
unconsciously he continued to address
himself aloud

   where there is a job they tell me im
too nice for it its a pity i wasnt born
a girl or given a plain face like a real
man here ive been standing this for
years dolly at the high school
 beauty on the campus  too pretty
for any real work when i asked uncle
john for a place in his office

  and he told jeannette thattoo about
the limit-having her say she liked me
well enough but i would have to do
something besides look sweet before she
could consider me seriously gee i i
wish i dared spend this quarter for some
thing to cat wish i had stayed at home
in old oklahoma wish-ive a good
mind to give those pretty pink checks of
mine a few slashes with a razor

   i wouldnt do that ill pay you
good wages for that lace of yours as
it is

  wharton turned to behold the man
who addrcssel him

  he was a magnificent-looking speci-
man tall military in bearing clad in
long gray coat and trousers wearing a
wide curly mustache and goatee-dia-
monds sparkling in the front of his broad
g

the argosy

bosom and on his plump fingers he
might have passed for some sort of
traveling evangelist had it not been for
the diamonds the shrewd sharpness of
his eyes and the cigar at an acute angle
lit his mouth

  he held out a big busincss-card on
which wharton read

   do you see that fellow over there
with that sign on a long rubber coat
asked the professor pointing down the
block

  wharton much perplexed admitted
that he did

   well the worthington complexion
elixir pays him a dollar and a half a
day for that ill give you three dollars
to wear a somewhat similar coat for me

  the look which wharton bestowed on
professor marlborough would have melt-
ed a more soluble substance the pro-
fessor did not melt he continued

   now look here youre broke
your home is in oklahoma presumably
no one knows you here im making you
a generous offer dont get hot about
it

   say exploded wharton  if you
think im open for that sort of a job
you want to guess again about four times
im broke and im hungry-a little
but im not a monkey on a stick yet

  	no interrupted the professor a
triile warmly  but youre a good deal
of a fool however if you happen to
get over it in a day or two i might not
find another face as pretty as yours and
you have my card

  wharton walked away from the pro-
fessor quite as rapidly as though he had
possessed some notion of where he wished
to go he thought about as rapidly as he
walked and his thinking was not at all
complimentary to professor marlbor
ough inventor and stile proprietor oi
marlboroughs imperial face cream

  hut by the time he had gone some
thirty or forty blocks bis steps became
less hurried

  his hunger had now reached a point
where it compelled him to part with
three-fifths of the value represented by
his last quarter even after that he had
to pull the buckle of his lx-lt up to the
final hole

  and rather hy accident than design
his footsteps turned vaguely back down
the avenue he presented his recom-
mendations to three or four managers of
various business houses on the way but
four oclock found him standing on the
curb his face turned toward the signs on
the second hoor of a certain building
proclaiming in silver and gold the won-
ders of marlboroughs facial treatments
and marlboroughs imperial face cream

  at precisely twenty three minutes past
four any of the passers-by who had taken
the trouble to notice might have seen a
certain remarkably handsome young man
walk hurriedly but dejectedly across the
same sidewalk and up the rubber-car-
peted steps leading to marlboroughs
parlors

  even when he had agreed to perform
the function and the coat had been red
lettered to suit the purposes of professor
marlborough he would probably have
side-stepped the whole proposition had
not the professor clinched the bargain by
offering him a dollar and a half in ad-
vance the dollar nnd a half meant
some sort of a place to sleep and some-
thing to cat and it finished whartons
last grain of pride

  and the next morning there walked
up sixth avenue across twenty-third
street down fifth avenue and back
west on fourteenth street a living ad-
vertisement that made even the venders
of mechanical toys and campaign buttons
rub their eyes

  he had a face that could not fail to
attract attention by its marvelous olive
and pink complexion and if it had not
attracted attention by its own beauty the
long rubber coat beneath was sufficient to
cause every one who passed to stare at
it intently

  for the huge red letters across the
front and back of the garment pro-
claimed to all the world

   got my complexion at marlborough

  at first the living sign-board walked
rapidly as though eager to get away

professor mari-borough

from everybody before anybody could sec
it and the people stared after a
while it walked more slowly as though
growing indifferent to what the world
might think and still the people stared

  long before noon it had come to spend
more time standing on the corners than
circulating through the streets and the
people continued to stare and stare and
stare

  and behind the lettered breast of the
rubber coat behind the hushed face of
such unwonted beauty were the heart and
soul of-wilbur wharton five weeks
ago lie had boon graduated with honor
from college three weeks since he had
taken what money he could get from his
uncle who had seen him through school
and then turned him down as a business
partner until he should have made his
living unaided fur three mouths with
that money he had come to new york
prepared to make any sort of living for
the time almost any sort but the sort he
had found

  he had planned to go back at the end
of the summer with his head high and
some extra dollars in his pocket pro-
vided he did not find something in the
hast too rood to leave lie had pictured
to himselt how he would face them all
with the pride of victory in his heart
and now he wondered whether he would
ever be able to face any one again

  of course none of his acquaintances
would see him none would ever know
of his disgrace he had even avoided
giving his name to his employer

  but hr knew lie would never be able
to forget whatever story he might tell
of successful enterprise in the east he
would know that he bad earned his pit-
tance by making a gazing-stock of him
self

  he had a half-hour at noon for lunch
lie removed his coat before entering a
fair-appearing place which advertised a

table ilhotr for fifty cents lie was
naturally of a buoyant disposition after
the dinner thing did not look so dark

  after all he was making a living he
was getting enough to keep him in a
clean room and give him three square
meals that was to his credit yes it
took real sand such sand as even he had
never suspected that he possessed

  at the worst it would e over in a few

   	a

months perhaps something else would
turn up meanwhile

  and when it was all over he would
have a decent position with his uncle he
would have shown that he could earn
his own bread and butter there would
be no more talk about his inability to do
anything but look pretty for they
would never know at home that he had
failed to do anything else

  he would go back alive-perhaps with
a very few dollars saved-and that would
be satisfactory evidence of his having
made his way no thank god they
would never know about it they would
never hear from him or another how lie
had come to this

  he would never have to tell of the
staring throng of the laughing maidens
who guyed him during noon hour of the
gibes from the sellers of pretzels and
penny candy-of the whole horrible dis-
gusting miserable affair

  in his effort to keep his spirits up to
the point of going on lie allowed his
mind to dwell on this one redeeming
feature of the situation-that no one who
knew him would hoar of this and then
just when this thought was beginning to
lose its stimulating power he lost it

  straight toward him up the street in a
taxicab gazing about with eager curi-
osity to sec all the strange city could
show she was coming-jeannette her-
self and unce john beside her

  wharton made a dive for the door of a
big store the porter promptly pushed
him out lie glanced over his shoul-
der toward the approaching automobile
then he started to run

   instantly he realized that he could not
get away in the crowd he thought of
keeping his backturned till the machinc
should pass but he felt sure that the
girl would somehow recognize him

  i lalf-cousins they had known each
other from childhood he would know
jeannette from any angle

  the last thought was that of getting
rid of the coat but the automobile was
so close that before he could get the
thing unbuttoned the mischicf would be
done he half turned his head to see
how near it had come and a way of
escape opened most unexpectedly

  a coal wagon had placed its chute at
the mouth of an open man-holc and


the argosy

wharton had turned hit head at the pre-
cise moment not to discover the chute or
the hole he tripped over the one and
into the other

  grasping wildly at nothing he sank
into blissful obscurity rather he had
just had a flashing intuition that it was
koing to be obscurity when his feet came
in contact with solid bottom

  his head had not passed below the
level of the sidewalk what was ijiore
the narrow limits of the orifice about him
would not admit of his stooping to get
his head below the sidewalk

  the crowd laughed first wharton
could not see anything funny until he
made sure that the red letters proclaim-
ing a false origin for his dainty skin
could not be seen while he remained in
the man-hole then lie began to realize
how funny he must look with his head
sticking out and he laughed harder than
all the crowd put together

  his laugh would have been too late
for any of the others to join in had not
jeannette and her uncle drawn up and
caught their first view of the show just
when every one else was beginning to
take it as a serious accidcnt

   well of all things laughed jean-
nette  weve been looking for you all
over town wilbur and now we find
your head

    was afraid i would find you in ft
hole roared uncle john then as
wilbur made no apparent effort to climb
out he stopped laughing  why dont
you come out of it  

   i-i cant get out cried wharton

  his laughing had stopped too he
was happy in the thought of staying
where he was the thought of coming
out did not appeal to him he pretended
to make a frantic effort to release him-
self

   im stuck he exclaimed

  uncle john climbed out of the taxicab
jeannette followed the old man came
over and reached down for wilburs
shoulders several of the men in the
crowd that had gathered saw the point
and joined in the effort to draw him out
of the hole

   why what arc you wearing that
rubber coat for today uncle john
paused to inquire

   i-i-cr-thought it was going to

rain when i started out this morning
wharton explained haltingly

  uncle john grunted whether it was
due to the exertion he now put forth or
some doubts as to the explanation wil-
bur could not tell

  uncle john pulled wharton spread
his knees apart against the brick sides of
the hole and tried to keep himself down
the beads of perspiration broke out on
his face

  at first the would-be rescuers were out
of unison in their pulling and the adver-
tisement for marlboroughs face cream
was able to hold his position it was
uncle john who suggested that they all
pull together on the count of three

  onetwo-now all together-three

  wharton came up about six inches
the top line of the red letters was dan-
gerously near the surface then he had
an inspiration he emitted a groan

   wait-my foot-i think its fast
somehow

  the crowd let go and waited

   hut youll have to come out some
way said uncle john and the crowd
joined him in taking hold again

  just at this moment n policeman ap-
pearedon the scene his advent caused
the helpers to fall back a little it gave
wharton time for another thought

    its this blamed coat that sticks he
announced suddenly  cant some one
cut the shoulders open so as to let me
out of it

  it was the work of a moment to rip the
shoulder seams of the rubber garment
uncle john and the policeman cach put
a hand inside under the coat and renewed
the pulling wharton was afraid the
coat would not slip off properly and
pressed harder with his knees

  two or three other men came back to
the task slowly they drew him upward
another foot whartons heart gave a
great leap of joy he was leaving the
rubber coat in the hole

  he let go with his knees he came up
with such a rush that his rescuers nearly
fell backward hastily wiping the coal-
dust from his hand he extended ilt toward
his uncle then he shook hands with
jeannette

  he felt that he deserved a lot more
congratulations than were being given
him on ills escape without injury
face value	

  he was about lo climb into the taxi-
cab in response to his unclcs invitation
when the policeman drew up the remnant
of torn rubber garment

  aint you goin to take this lie
asked as he lifted the ugly thing aloft

   its natural stiffness spread it out from
the ripped shoulder there was a loud
laugh lrom the late rescuers joined in by
all who had gathered-all except jean-
nette and uncle john

  the old man gave one glancc at the
flapping rubber iiis facc grew very
red-red as the letters he saw

   get in quick jeannette and wilbur
he snapped furiously

  as he swung onto the step himself he
fairly shouted at the chauffeur now
drive like the devil for the waldorf

  it seemed a long weary ride to whar-
ton once he glanced sidewise at his
uncle to discover that old gentleman
sternly gazing far ahead once he glanced
at jeannette and saw tears in her eyes

  he had seen her cry with vexation on
one other occasion when they two had
passed some urchins on the street at
home and overheard one say golly
dat girl i almost as purty an dc feller

   as soon an you have got yourself
cleaned up please come to my room
ordered uncle john as the three left
the elevator in the hotel

  wilbur did not have the courage to
look at either of his relatives he
started after the hall-boy who led the
way the older man however brushed
past the boy and hurrying across the
main room of the suite slammed the
door to his own bedroom

  wilbur looked about to see where he
should go for his ablutions his eyes
met jeannettes fresh tears started in
the girls large orbs

   oh hilly she half whispered half
wept  youve had an awful time havent
you but i dont carc it was just splen-
did of you and-and-i love you for it

  before wilbur could reply she like
her father had swept into one of the
little rooms and closed the door

  there was a third door and wharton
entered it lie was soon busy with the
process of scrubbing his hands and face
it worried him that he had not his din-
ner clothes with him it worried him
more that he had an interview with
uncle john coming to him hut jean-
nette had just said she loved him and the
worries were all but lost in the noise
made by his joyously beating heart

  whence it came to pass tbat he did
not knock so very timidly at his uncles
door alter all he felt that he could
stand several pretty hard lectures it
took all his self control to preserve an
attitude of proper humility under the
circumstance

  the old man stood waiting for him
he looked pretty serious and almost
frightened away his nephews lately ac-
quired cheerfulness

   iook here my boy he began quite
gravely

  wilbur had heard him begin like that
efore his heart dropped a little
further

   youre going back with us to-mor-
row you can get up early and get your
things wherever they arc we leave on
the noon train

  yes uncle john said wilbur
meekly

    i think  shall need you in the busi-
ness sooner than i expected the fact
is my boy  there was a catch in the
old mans voice- the fact is youve
shown spunk and im proud of you
you can have about anything ive got
to giv

   ything asked wilbur eagerly

   yes anything replied his uncle
with a nod of his gray head

   even jeannette urged wilbur

    yes even jeannette-if shes willing
-and god bless you both

           idleness

there is no remedy for time misspent

  no healing for the waste of idleness

whose very languor is a punishment

  heavier than active souls can feel or guess

 chapter xii

 j kkky the lao

when tom reached home that eve-
ning he resolved to say nothing
of what had occurrcd that day either to
angelina or the doctor

   its no good alarming them he
thought  to tell them would do no
good and would only set them in a
panic besides its just possible that i
may ik wrong perhaps the old man
really lid want me to go to boston on
business for the firm and  may have
been a fool to refuse

   i dont think  was wrong how-
ever i think im correct in believing
that theyre up to some mischief ill
keep my eyes open thats about all i
can do  guess

  after supper the doctor announced
that he was not feeling well he was
tired and would go to led

  angelina sat in the dining-room busy
with some needlework

 begin september argy

  tom would have liked to sit and
watch her as she made the sewing ma-
chine fairly hum but he felt uneasy
and restless and fearing she would de-
tect his mood he announced that he
would take his pipe and sit outside 
the porch for a little while

  he sat in a big bamboo rocker taking
long puffs at his brier and musing over
the events of that day

   its a queer game he muttered
 what puzzles me is why that old vil-
lain and bis son should have been so
agitated by that harmless remark i made
about tramps i wonder if tramps
have anything to do with their plans

  as he said the words he became
conscious of a heavy footstep crunching
the gravel path which led to the house

  in the gloom he recognized a rough-
looking man coming toward the porch

  talking of tramps ill be lulngcd
if this isnt one of the simon-pure brand
i wonder what he wants here  wish
i had a gun he may be after mischief

it isnt safe to go unarmed here ill
certainly buy a revolver first thing to-
morrow morning

   say mister began the man an lie
reached the porch  i havent had a
meal for three days would you mind
giving me a little supper

   were all out of victuals my friend
said tom sharply  all weve got is
a couple of savage bulldogs and a pair
of six-shooters how would they do

  no  reckon im not interested
replied the tramp  bulldogs may be
all right if youre very hungry but 
reckon  aint hungry enough for them
as for six-shooters they never did agree
with my stomach

 well then be off said tom
threateningly

   not just yet returned the tramp
 im tired and  reckon ill rest here
a little while couldnt put me up for
the night could you

  nope said tom  our dogs
dont like strangers and theyd be liable
to attack you those six-hootcrs i
spoke of might go off accidentally too

   well mister drawled the tramp
 i reckon if you really had dogs or six-
shooters youd have produced em by this
time im too old a bird to be bluffed
by the way would you mind coming
over here under the lamp theres
something about your voice which sounds
very familiar and id like to see your
face

  fearing some trick tom made no at-
tempt to move the tramp struck a
match and as it flared up held it be-
fore the others face

  well  declare the hobo ex-
claimed with genuine surprise if it
aint an old pal of mine very much
changed in appearance tis true and
with a beard thats very becoming but
still recognizable to one who knows him
as well as i do how nre you tom
robbins shake hands old pal you
dont mean to say youve forgotten me
do you  

  toms face had gone very pale by
the flare of the match he had recognized
the visitor

  jerry the lag he exclaimed in
horror

  the very same i thought you
hitfht forgotten your old college chum

at sing sing academy for refined young
gentlemen howve you been tom i
little expected to find you here old pal
they told me there was a boarder living
here but  never had the ghost of an
idea that the boarder was none other
than my old prison pal tom robbins

   for gods sake keep your voice
down  gasped tom  what are you
doing here jerry what do you want

   well to tell you the truth tom i
came here simply on a little reconnoiter-
ing expedition just wanted to look
around a bit to get the lay of the land
so to speak but discovering you here
will alter all my plans of course i
thought i was going to have quite a
difficult job i came prepared for it
but seeing that ive met you i reckon
illy work is going to be much easier

   you cant tell how glad i am to see
you old man ive been wondering all
along what became of you after you left
prison

  hush whispered tom in terror
 for heavens sake dont speak so
loud theres people inside the house
and theyll hear you lets take a little
walk jerry

   all right said the other  im
willing im feeling sort of languid
and the night air may do me good
lets see if youre armed first tommy
youll excuse me for being careful
wont you you cant trust anybody in
these days of trusts and monopolies you
know

  he patted each of toms pockets in
turn

  no six shooters eh he mumbled
 thats good  knew you were only
bluffing about those dogs and those
smoke-wagons you ought to carry a
gun tom you cant tell when you
may need one in these wild parts now
i never think of traveling without one
somebody might rob me you know
cant afford to take any chances

  see what a nice little -caliber ive
got here pretty little toy aint it
come on now lets take that walk
id just as soon talk here on this com-
fortable looking porch  but if youre in-
clined for a promenade im willing

  afraid that angelina might overhear
his companions words tom hastily led
him down the gravel walk and did not


the argosy

stop until they were a hundred yards
from the house

   now he gasped  we are out of
earshot tell me quickly jerry what
do you want here what the game

   well ill be candid with you tom
as pals should he with each other im
back at my old tricks again im the
slickest second-story man in the kast
and ive got a big job on hand

  what is it nsked tom breath-
lessly

   ihat house we just came from

   theres nothing there for you

cried tom in alarm  honestly there
isnt jerry theres nobody but a poor
old man and his daughter living there
theyre horribly poor havent got a
red cent it wouldnt he worth your
while to tackle that job

   theres a safe there said jerry
smilingly  youve forgotten the safe
tom i reckon theres something
mighty valuable in the safe

  there isnt jerry honest there
isnt replied tom earnestly  theres
nothing in that safe but a few papers of
no financial value

   well i reckon ill need those
papers said the tramp with a laugh

  what for whispered tom hoarse-
ly  i tell you jerry those papers
arc of no use to anybody but the owner
it wouldnt pay you to take them it
wouldnt he worth the risk

   bless your innocent heart tom
there wont he any risk leered the
other patting his revolver-pocket sig-
nificantly

   you dont mean to say- began
tom too overcome with horror to he
able to finish the sentence

   that id shoot if ncccssary yes
thats right thats just what  mean
replied jerry  im a peaceable man
if theyll let me be but a holy terror
when riled i prefers the gentle way
bccausc its the easiest but if anybody
tries to interfere with me in my work
hed better order his coftm aforehand
now im going to have those papers in
that safe whether theres bloodshed or
whether there aint

   but why do you want them cried
tom  havent  told you that they
are of no earthly value to you cant
you take my word for it jerry

   never you mind why i want them
tom rohbins said the other man
 thats my affair and not yours dont
you be asking any embarrassing ques-
tions im hete to question you not to
be questioned ive told you my busi-
ness  now i want to know yours

  what are you doing here eh
whats your graft whats your object
in hanging around this old man and his
daughter eh are you after those
valueless papers in the safe too eh
come out with it tell me the truth as
a pal should whats your game eh

   ive got no game replied tom ear-
nestly  im leading a straight life
jerry i am indeed im just board-
ing here with the old doctor and his
daughter who have been very kind to
me thats all

  humph so youve reformed eh
bccome a church-member i suppose
and an honored and respectable citizen
of ucnford eh i suppose youve got a
spotless reputation around these parts
and are looked up to by everybody in-
cluding the old doctor and his daughter
perhaps youre going to marry the
daughter just like it happens in the
story books eh

   oh my but youre a sly dog tom
robbins i never gave you credit for
such slackness hy the way i suppose
you go under your own name here  

   no said tom with a sigh  im
known as tom watson

   ah and nobody knows where you
came from everybody thinks youve
been perfectly proper and respectable
all your life i suppose

   yes said tom

   including the old doctor and his
daughter

  including them sighed tom 
hope voure not going to give me away
jerry

   well perhaps i am and then again
perhaps im not it all depends on you
old pal you wouldnt like the doctor
and his daughter and all the town of
ben ford to know that youre an ex-con-
vict and that your name aint watson at
all

   well if it has to be it has to be i
suppose said tom resignedly  i
suppose i cant expect any mercy at your
hands jerry the lag after the tvfiji
the jailbird

g

did you in prison you swore then that
youd got square and  suppose you re-
gard this as your opportunity

   well thats where you do me a
wrong said jerry indignantly  i
dont hear any hard feeling loin its
true that you dul spoil m plot to break
from sing sing by refusing to be a party
to it ii was a sure thing and we could
have made our escape us easy a pie but
you balked because you were too much
of a coward to take a chance and kill a
man or two

   i did swear id gel square on you for
that for i was very sore toin -any
man would be- but bless you ive for-
gotten that  bear no ill will now
im willing to keep my mouth shut and
pretend that youre a perfect stranger
to me im willing to let you go on
living as mr tom watson a respect-
able citizen of benford  dont want
to be mean and spoil your game tom

   thanks replied toni gratefully
 ii you really mean this its very kind
of you jerry the lag

  m oh ive got a kind heart ill do
just as i say tom and ill only ask one
thing in return

  ah whats that asked tom ap-
prehensively

   those papers in the safe i want
them youll have to get them fur me

  impossible cried tom i ex-
pected this jerry i knew that you
were not going to let me oly for nothing
im sorry  but it cant be clone

   you refuse ch  

   im afraid ill have to

   you fully realize what the conse-
quence will ik 

   ill have to face them i suppose
groaned tom

   no you dont have to at all why
not be reasonable and give me that for
mula 

  all you know that that safe con-
tains a formula eh cried tom
 that was a bad slip of the tongue
jerry now  know why youre here
youre hired by that pair of scoundrels
darcy  son to pull oft this job the
unprincipled cutthroats well you can
do what you like to me jerry but you
shant succeed in carrying out this
dastardly work ill prevent you if it
costs me my life

  oh no you wont tom robbins
youve got common sense and youll
listen to reason

    i tell you you shant get that for-
mula said tom grimly

   come tom be sensible urged the
other  you dont want to be exposed
to the whole town and to your frienclu
here as an ex-convict why not he rea-
sonable nobody will ever know that
you had anything to do with this job
i swear  wont split theres honor
among thieves you know even the old
man and his daughter will never get
wise

   as soon as ive turned the formula
over to darcy  son as per contract

ill be hundreds of miles away from
here as quick as a train can take me
all youll have to do will be to keep
your mouth shut and darcy  soil
will ik- blamed for the thelt nobody
will ever suspect you

   i cant do it said tom  im go-
ing to save that formula at any cost

   even at the cost of going to prison
for nearly all the rest of your life said
jerry the lag quietly  youve bad a
good taste of sing sing tom robbins
you dont want to go back there for a
long term of years do you  

   what do you mean   cried tom
hoarsely

   burglary and arson is what i mean
i suppose you know that theres two war-
rants out for your arrest tom youre
charged with robbing a man named dol-
man in new york city and with setting
fire to your brothers factory in peekskill
arson is a very serious offense old pal
and punishable with a long term of im-
prisonment

   its a lic-a dirty contemptible
lie cried loin angrily theyve
trumped up these charges to ruin me
im innocent of both  swear it jerry

    well its no use swearing it to me
said the other with a cruel huigh  im
not the jury looks to me though as
if theyve got a pretty strong case against
you my lky whether youre innocent
or guilty wont make any difference

    suppose you realize that theyll
convict you just the same nnd send you
up for a nice bunch of years youre an
ex-convict and no jury would give you
a show  our past is against you you


the argosy

could protest your innocence for a year
but it wouldnt do you any good as
soon as youre arrested youre as good
as sentenced

  tom groaned

   i suppose you know that theres a
reward of a hundred dollars offered for
your capture the policc of this town
would like to earn that hundred a
word from me would mean your arrest
to morrow morning

   for iods sake have mercy jerry 
gasped tom

  of course ill have mercy aint i
making you a reasonable offer give
me that formula and your secrets safe
so far as im concerned

   oh i cant i really cant do it
cried tom desperately  i cant turn
upon my benefactors in cold blood
theyve been good friends to me 
cant betray them

   well you wont help them any by
refusing said jerry calmly  ive
been offered a big bunch of money to
pull off this job and as you know im
a man that sticks at nothing do you
know what my original plans were of
course i had no idea when i made them
that you were living at the house

   i came up here on a rcconnoitering
expedition as i said before to try to
get a good look at that safe and learn
the exact location of it  intended to
come back later to-night and blow the
thing open of course that would
have attracted the attention of the in-
mates of the bouse but i wasnt worry-
ing about that

   i had been warned that there was a
boarder living there who might make
trouble and i bad been advised to hit
him on the head or plug him full of
lead as n as he showed himself of
course i never suspected that you were
the boarder old pal i was going to
hand out the same medicine too to the
old doctor and his daughter in a
word as soon as anybody stirred  in-
tended to make short work of them with
this and he patted his revolver-pocket
affectionately

  tom shuddered

   you see old pal continued jerry
 if you really want to help these people
youll get me that formula and save
their lives besides saving yourself from

exposure and a long term of imprison-
ment now what arc you going to do
about it hurry up and make up your
mind

   you wouldnt really murder them
would you jerry cried tom aghast

   well i would not like to do it but
if it was necessary i wouldnt hesitate
for a minute my mind is made up
tom either your promise to go back
to the house and bring me that formula
right away or ill go there now and take
it by force its up to you tom rob-
bins only i warn you again that if you
wont be agreeable and save me a lot of
unnecessary trouble and bloodshed ill
tip off the authorities and have you sent
to prison on those charges you know
me old pal i always carry out my
threats dont i now what arc you
going to do 

   give me a couple of hours to think
it over jerry begged the wretched
tom

  a couplo of hours its out of the
question tom what will i be doing
while your thinkery-tank is at work
id die of ennui in the mean time no
sir i wont be mean though  ill split
the difference with you ill give you a
whole ten minutes to make up your
mind

chapter xiii

a ktkloglk

  a man can do a great deal of thinking
in ten minutes

  tom robbins realized this as lie pon-
dered over the ultimatum of jerry the
lag he knew that he was completely
in the villains power

  the prospect of going to prison again
for a long term was horrifying he
knew that jerry was right too

  he didnt stand a ghost of a show
once lie was arrested he was as good as
sent away

  then too angelina and her kind-
hearted old father would learn that lie
was an impostor an ex-convict that
is to say they would learn it if they were
alive on the morrow to learn anything

  the chances were that jerry would
carry out his threat go to the bouse and
blow up the safe with dynamite the
the jailbird



old man or angelina would hear him
and come down-stairs in alarm then the
desperate jerry would commit murder
without compunction

  he knew jerrys character having
seen much of him during his four years
imprisonment and realized that the
wretch had no conscience

  tom shuddered

   why youre shivering   exclaimed
jerry and it aint a cold night
cither you must keep up your couragc
tom its an easy job and nobody will
ever discover your part in it

   ill tell you what well do old pal
well walk to the booze emporium and
get a little good whisky- that will
brace you up come on you can think
just as well walking and ill extend the
time-limit five minutes

  as though in a dream tom followed
his villainous companion still trying to
reason out what course he should pursue

   their lives are plainly in danger
he mused  it seems to me it is my
duty to save them by giving up that for-
mula as jerry says he would get it
anyhow even if i refused to give it to
him hes artped and im not i
couldnt prevent him from going to the
house this minute and cracking that safe
i might raise an outcry but that would
only make bloodshed certain the old
man and angelina would be murdered
and perhaps jerry would kill me too
even if he did not lie would tip off the
authorities as to my identity and i should
be sent to prison which would be worse
than death clod help me

  there was another argument too
which kept appealing to tom robbins
he tried desperately to wave it back but
it insisted on asserting itself

  if the darcys got hold of that for-
mula young alfred would probably jilt
angelina it would be a hard blow for
the girl but she would get over it sooner
or later then the field would be clear
and he tom would have his chance

  it was no use trying to deceive himself
any longer he knew now that he was
in vc with angelina he knew that it
was more than he could bear to see her
betrothed to alfred darcy

  by giving that formula to jerry the
iag everything would turn out satisfac-
torily for him

  his share in the shabby business would
never be revealed jerry would be paid
by the darcys and would leave town at
once for his own sake the darcys
would keep quiet to protect themselves
and when young alfred jilted angelina
and a little later on the firm of darcy

	son began turning out the new patent-
leather according to formula dr tlreen
and his daughter would surely believe
that darcy  son were solely respon-
sible for the robbery and would hate
them accordingly

  he tom could go on living a respecta-
ble life nobody in uenford would know
that bis name was not tom watson that
he was really tom robbins an ex-con-
vict he would make angelina love
him he knew that she cared for him
quite a little already

  she couldnt really love alfred
darcy or would she not have entrusted
the latter with the combination of the
safe no she had merely an infatua-
tion for alfred which would disappear
when she discovered the duplicity of the
dareys

  by the time they reached the saloon
tom had almost made up his mind he
would give jerry that formula he tried
to persuade himself that be was doing it
to save the lives of dr green and his
daughter but in his heart he knew that
the other arguments had prevailed

   heres the booze emporium said
jerry  lets go up stairs where wc can
be alone your time is up tom rob-
bins come up-stairs and ill order
some drinks while we talk it over i
hope youve made up your mind to be
sensible

  tom did not answer they climbed
the rickety stair-case to the little sitting-
room above the bar

   bring us some of your best whisky
said jerry to the waiter  none of your
cheap sort mind you the best youve
got in the house

  the waiter looked suspiciously at
jerrys shabby clothing

   show me first that youve got the
price to pay for it he said gruffly

  price i scoffed jerry and threw
a hundred-dollar bill upon the table
howll that do you

   humph said the man and examined
the bill suspiciously
g

the argosy

  then he glanccd at tom robbins and
the latters more respectable appcarunce
seemed to reassure him for lie left the
room and returned a minute afterward
with a bottle of whisky and two glasses
jerry poured out two big drinks

   here old pal drink hearty he
said genially  thisll make your
teeth stop chattering and put some lire
in your veins ah thats the way
drink hearty my boy here have an-
other drink heres luck to you and the
doctor and his pretty daughter i sup-
pose she is prrtty aint she well take
it for granted come drink up old pal
dont be bashful thats right good
whisky aint it  

  tom was not a drinking man but be
felt the need of a stimulant just then
and he quailed the fiery liquor eagerly

   and now lets hear your decision
tom said jerry when they had emptied
their glasses for the fourth time  do
 get that formula with your kind assist-
ance or must i take it by force at the
sacrifice of human life

   ive been thinking il all out jerry
said tom slowly and ive come to the
conclusion that its my duty to save their
lives by helping you

   ah thats the sensible way to look
at it my boy cried jerry heartily  no
youd better not take any more booze
tom give me that bottle youve
had quite enough already if you get
jagged you wont be able to gel that safe
open without alarming the whole town
be diacrcet my boy if you value your
safety and your reputation you dont
want to be caught at the safe red-hand-
ed do you 

  tom shuddered

  thats just what im afraid of
jerry he whispered hoarsely  the
doctor or angelina might come down-
stairs and detect me while i was at the
safe id rather go to prison for the
rest of my life than have that happen

   well you must manage it so skil-
fully that they wont hear you said
jerry

  turn shook his head

   no jerry he said  im too much
of a coward to attempt it  couldnt
carry out the job successfully  id make
a noise and bungle it

   nonsense retorted jerry rcassur

ingly  why should you make any noise
tom it aint as if youll have to blow
that safe open or even crack it you
dont mean to tell me that you dont
know the combination do you ive
reckoned all along that you did of course
youre too smart to have lived in that
house without learning that secret i
give you credit for that tom

  tom robbins suddenly saw his op-
portunity and hesitated if he could
convince jerry that he did not know the
combination and that he was therefore
powerless to get the formula the whole
deal would bp oft-

  jerry could not expect him to crack
the safe or blow it up with dynamite
the fellow must know that he was not
an experienced burglar and that it would
be folly to expect him to do a burglars
work

  here was his chance to escape this
whole dirty business he could save
himself from any participation in this
crime by declaring that he did not have
the combination of the afc it was so
simple a way out that it was a wonder
it had not occurred to him before this
and yet he remained silent

   well said jerry impatiently how
about it tom i took i for granted
you knew that combination do you or
dont you

  tom made up bis mind suddenly he
would be loyal to dr green and ange-
lina despite the terrible temptation to
betray them

   no said he hoarsely  i swear to
you jerry that i dont know it to
himself he added  may god forgive
me for that lie  

  jerrys face went white with anger
and disappointment

   very well he said calmly  that
settles it youll have to force the safe
then and bring me that formula

   but i cannot do it jerry ive had
no experience nt safe-cracking ill
spoil the whole thing get myself in seri-
ous trouble and not get the formula
either

  ill loan you some dynamite said
jerry generously

   i wouldnt know how to use it if you
did rejoined tom

    ive got n full set of tools went on
jerry  i think if i was to give you a
the jailuikd



course of instruction youd be able to do

the job all right this is a great dis-
appointment to me tom robbins i
thought for sure that you knew that com-
bination and that our work was going to
be easy

   im sorry said tom earnestly  i
really am jerry ive got a suggestion
though why not put this thing off for
a couple of days in the mean time ill
do my best to learn that combination 
think i can manage it by then

  for answer jerry the iag winked one
eye

   youre a wise guy aint you tom
robbins he sneered but wise as you
are you make one big mistake you take
jerry the lag for a fool and in that
youre wrong very very wrong

   so im to give you two days to learn
the combination eh walt two long
days that would give you plenty of
time to warn the old doctor to take the
formula out of the safe and hide it some-
where that would also give ypu plenty
of time to leave bcnford and get out of
the clutches of the law eh youre a
wise guy tommy and no mistake and i
give you credit for it but it wont
work my boy it wont work now
you listen to me

  the admonition was unnecessary for
tom was listening breathlessly

   one of us is going to leave this here
saloon right now to crack that safe
went on the ruffian  fither its you
or me who does the trick  dont care
how you pulls off the job you can use
dynamite you can use these tools ive
got in my pocket or if youre lying to
me about that combination as im in-
clined to suspect you can turn the knob
and open the safe door like a peaceful
law abiding citizen i dont carc bow
you work it but you must bring me that
formula immediately do you under-
stand 

   it cant be done said tom

   very well then you can consider
the whole deal off to-morrow morn-
ing  notifies the police here that theres
a man named torn robbins in this town
whos wanted for arson and burglary
you cant run far away in the mean
time and besides if you do run away
itll lie all the better for me theyll
blame you for this job

   remember youre already aroused of
blowing open dolmans safe in new
york so theyll give you credit for being
an experienced hand at safe-cracking

   and in the mean time im going to
the doctors house right now to pull off
the job as i originally planned if the
doctor or his pretty daughter happens to
hear me at work and come down stairs
theyll be killed thats all good-by
for the present old pal im sorry we
cant do business together

  he rose from his chair and walked
towards the door

   stop   cried tom hoarsely  take
the formula if you must but dont kill
them jerry have pity on an old man
and a poor young girl you must have
some heart jerry you wont commit
murder in cold blood

   as ive told you a dozen times aid
jerry impatiently  ive no desire to
murder anybody im a kind-hearted
man i want that formula though and
im going to have it if jrn interfered
with ill be obliged to shoot to kill
thats all

  he took another step toward the door

   youd better stay here he called
over his shoulder  youd better not
come near the house while im doing the
trick or you might get killed too re-
member im armed and youre not

   stop  cried tom in terror  dont
go jerry ive lied to you i do know
the combination of that safe

  ah exclaimed jerry triumphantly
returning to his scat at the table  i
thought i would scare you into confes-
sion old pal so youll do the trick after
all eh like a good fellow thats
right

   im afraid to open that safe my
self gasped tom  but ill give you
the combination jerry you ought to
be able to open the safe then without
disturbing the doctor or angelina god
knows im only doing it for their sakes
for that reason and no other ill give
you the combination jerry but dont
ask me to open the safe and get the for-
mula myself i couldnt do it

  very well said jerry  ill be gen-
erous with you my boy i dont see why
i should take any risk when ive got you
in my power and ought to be able to use
you to pull my chestnuts out of file fire


the argosy

still as i just observed ill be generous
jive me the combination and ill do the
trick myself

   and you wont murder the old man
and his daughter

   not unless they are awakened and
make it necessary for me to do it to save
myself if i know the combination
however its hardly likely that that will
happen im too old a hand at the job
to make any noise getting into the place
and ill oil the hinges of the safe so that
they wont squeak  guess they wont
hear me hurry up and give me the
combination old pal

   and youll never tell a soul that you
got it from me asked tom anxiously

   not a soul i promise

   and youll keep your mouth shut
about my past  

   i promise you

   and you wont tip oft the police 

    wont ill keep my word old
pal come hurry up and write that
combination heres paper and pencil
if you havent got any hurry up now
ana write it before you change you
mind

  the two men were sitting on opposite
sides of the little table there was no-
body else in the room tom took the
proffered pencil and paper sighed and
hesitated

   jo on said terry more impatiently
 what are you waiting for you idiot
hurry up and write it  tell you

    dont like to do it jerry groaned
tom  it seems such a dastardly piece
of work

   you know whatll be the conse-
quences if you refuse said jerry omi-
nously

   yes sighed tom  i guess id bet
ter do it it will be the best for every-
body god knows its only for their
sakes im doing it only to save them

  he sighed again but began to write
some figures on the sheet of paper sigh-
ing over each numeral as though he were
signing his own death warrant

   here it is he said hoarsely  heres
tlie combination of the safe jerry and
may cod forgive me for what im
doing

  jerry the lag leaned eagerly over the
table to seize the extended paper but to
his surprise just as his fingers were about

to grasp it tom robbins suddenly with-
drew it

  no no he gasped jumping to
his feet his face deathly white and his
ryes dilated with horror  i cant do
it  cant do it jood god what a
cur  am she entrusted me with the
secret of the combination as a mark of
her confidence in me and  was about to
betray it i wont do it no matter what
the cost you can do your worst you
cowardly scoundrel but you shant make
a judas out of me 

   lie was about to tear the telltale paper
into shreds when with an oath jerry the
lag rushed around the table and fre-
ziedlv grasped his wrist

   give me that paper-you  lie cried
 you miserable sneaking coward im
just about tired of your fits and starts
give ine that paper or ill-

  he didnt finish the sentence for as
he made a desperate effort to pry open
tom robbinss clenched fist and seize
the crumplcd scrap it contained tom
with his free hand seized the whisky bot-
tle on the table and brought it down
with full force upon the scoundrels
head

  jerry the lag fell to the lloor with a
terrifying thud blood streaming from
his broken scalp

  ive killed him good god ive
killed him cried tom in horror as he
bent over the prostrate man

  not a sign of animation great
heavens lies dead sure enough i ill
have murder to answer for now was
anybody ever so unfortunate as i good-
ness knows lie brought this on himself
though the blackmailing scoundrel
thank heaven anyway i didnt betray
angelinas confidence it makes me
shudder to think how near i was to giving
him this paper that treachery would
have been worse than murder

  he took a match and ignited the crum-
plcd paper crushing the ashes with his
foot so that nothing hut dust remained

  then he looked down again at the un-
conscious jerry

    dont think hes dead he mur-
mured hopefully  he seems to be
breathing slightly maybe hell come
to in a little while perhaps hes only
stunned after all at any rate id better
get away from here as quickly as possible
the jailbird

c

somebody will be coming up stairs in a
minute or two and then ill ik- arrested

  he again knelt beside the prostrate
jerry and uttered an exclamation of joy
as be observed that the ruffian showed
signs of returning animation

  just then the six-shooter in jerrys
hip-pocket caught his eye and he stealth-
ily withdrew it and put it in his own
pocket

   i guess ill borrow this for a little
while he muttered jerry may be
coming to presently and when he docs
ill probably need this he seems to he
coming around all right i reckon its
high time for me to take my departure
thank heaven he didnt get that paper
the secret is still safe im glad i
realized my mistake at the last minute

  he crept slowly down the rickety
stairs without attracting the attention of
anybody in the barroom and ran swiftly
toward the house of dr green

chapter xiv

betrayed

   

   i was midnight when tom robbins
reached the greens and crept up-stairs
to his room

  he shuddered as he reviewed the
events of the evening

   im in a desperate fix he gasped
 if jerry dies ill have to face a charge
of murder i suppose that will mean
that ill go to the electrlc-chalr as an
ex-convict ill stand no chance

   and if jerry lives im just as badly
off or worse hell be thirsting for re-
venge i know that he never forgets or
forgives hell expose me to the whole
town to-morrow and ill be arrested and
sent to prison for those two crimes

   angelina will learn the truth and
shrink from me with horror serves me
right i suppose for deceiving these good
people in the first place

   well at any rate i reckon the
formula is safe for another day even if
jerry recovers i reckon hell not he in a
condition to come here to-night to crack
that safe that whisky bottle came down
with an awful thud i didnt know my
right arm possessed such strength i
reckon though that if jerry does recover
hell be around here for that formula

before many days have passed and if
ive killed him i suppose those scoun-
drels the darcys will hire another thug
to do their dirty work thats why they
wanted to get me to boston-so that i
would be out of the way when they
found that i was determined not to go
they instructed jerry the lag to kill me
if  offered any resistance theyre a
fine pair of rogues

   i wonder why they gave up their
original idea of getting me to do the
job perhaps they discovered that 
wasnt the man for it or perhaps they
fell in with jerry accidentally after
making the arrangement with me and
thought that be could accomplish their
purpose in shorter time

   well no matter what happens to me
ill do my best to fool them in their
efforts to rob this poor old man ill
keep jerrys gun with me night and day
and ill not hesitate to use it if occasion
offers

   i think in the morning ill warn the
doctor that it would be advisable to re-
move that formula from the safe and
hide it somewhere else theres no tell-
ing what tricks those rogues may be up
to its very evident that they are des-
perate and are going to leave no stone
unturned to get that formula in their
hands

  he was wearied by the mental and
nervous strain lie had gone through and
a few minutes alter his head touched the
pillow he was fast asleep

  he was awakened at eight by a knock-
ing on the door

  he had been dreaming all night of
ghastly scenes in which jerry the lag
figured prominently sometimes it was
jerry who lay dead before him a bloody
spectacle and sometimes it was the old
doctor and angelina stretched lifeless
upon the floor while jerry the iag stood
over them with a sardonic grin upon his
evil face

  the knocking at the door caused him
to open his eyes in affright

  whos there he cried fearfully

  its i mr watson answered the
voiec of angelina oh romc down-
stairs quickly please something terrible
has happened please hurry i 
ytom hastily slipped into his clothes
and hurried below fearing the worst


the argosy

    suppose theyve found out about
the murder of jerry the lag he mut-
tered grimly  and the cops arc wait-
ing down stairs to arrest me oh well
 saved the formula anyway i guess
theres nothing left but to face the music
with a bold front death by electricity
aint the worst kind of a death anyway

  with this exceedingly chilly comfort
lie opened the dining-room door aud
was startled at the sight which met his
gaze

  the old doctor was pacing up and
down the room distractedly clenching his
lists and muttering incoherently angc
lina sat there pale as death and weeping
pitifully

  one glance in the direction of the safe
enlightened tom as to the cause of their
emotion

  the safe was open its heavy iron
door had been swung back on its hinges
os far as it would go

  tom gasped with surprise

   surely it cant be possible- he be-
gan when the old man interrupted him

   its more than possible its hap-
pened   he cried passionately  some
dastardly robber has opened that safe
nnd stolen my formula my formula i
do you heed me mr watson my
formula oh my god im ruined im
ruined all my hopes arc blasted all
my dreams of fortune are at an end
my formula has gone some sneaking
wretch has stolen it oh my heavens
i shall go crazy 

   who can have done it  asked tom
white to the lips

   i wish  knew cried the old man
 old as i am id kill him i id show him
no mercy if  had him in my grasp the
treacherotis dog 

  tom walked toward the open safe and
examined the lock

   why he gasped  it hasnt been
forced open 

  forced open no i screamed the
old man   i should say not its been
deliberately opened by somebody who
knew the combination there are only
two persons in the whole world who arc
supposed to know the combination- my
daughter and me who else can have
discovered it

  tom looked scarchingly at angelina
who was sobbing violently

   could it be possible that she told
young darcy after all he mused

   do you suspect anybody sir he
asked turning to the distracted doctor

  do  suspect anybody cried the
unfortunate old man  how can  help
it i suspect everybody i suspect you
god forgive me i even suspect angelina
somebody has betrayed me id just like
to find out who it is 

  oh father  cried angelina in hor-
ror  how can you say that mow can
you suspect me  

   you and  were the only two who
knew that combination my girl  cried
her father wildly  not another soul
knew it  never told it to anybody but
you i low can i help suspecting you
i dont think that you stole the formula
but i am afraid that you were tempted
into giving the secret of the combination
to somebody-to young alfred darcy
probably

  oh my god if i find that its true
if i find that it was he who has done
this dastardly thing ill kill him i
swear  will as for you my girl if i
find out that its you who betrayed my
secret ill never speak a word to you
again as long as i live i swear it 

    oh father father i  gasped the girl
 how can you make such terrible

threats 

  she burst into a paroxysm of wild sob-
bing and her father unable to contain
himself any longer hastily left the room
banging the door behind him

  after he had gone tom looked at
angelina and angelina looked at tom

    oil mr watson cried the girl pas-
sionately  give as back that formula
for the love of god give it back to us
oh i trusted you so it was cruel of
you to betray us oh why did you do
this terrible thing there is still time
to make amends you see the awful suf-
fering you have caused give me back

that-

  stop stop miss angelina stop
i implore you cried tom in agony
 why do you think it was  who stole
it i swear to you miss angelina that
i have never touched that safe youll
believe me wont you

  the girl cast upon him a look of scorn

   no she cried passionately  i can-
not believe you mr watson i wish to
the jaiibird



heaven that  could you arc the only
person besides my father and myself who
knows the combination uf that safe it
must have been you who opened it in the
night and stole its contents

  oh how could you do it how
could you do it  gave you the secret
of the combination to show my confi
dence in your honor oh you cannot
deny-

  before she could finish the sentence
the old doctor had entered the room and
rushed upon tom

   i heard what she said i i heard what
she just said   he screamed seizing the
unfortunate man by the throat  like
a fool she entrusted you with the combi-
nation and it is you who have robbed us
you cur you traitor you thief you in-
grate give me back my formula or ill
strangle you i 

  old and feeble as he was his grasp
upon toms throat was so tight that the
latter spluttered and gasped for breath

   give me back my formula i say
give it to me if you value your life
ive got strength enough loft to kill you
and ill do it unless you return to me
what you have stolen you treacherous
thief

  it is probable that his frenzied fingers
would have choked the life out ol the
surprised tom who was too dazed to
offer any resistance if angelina had not
rushed to her fathers side and come to
his victims aid

   father father what are you do-
ing she screamed  can not you see
that you arc killing him oh for gods
sake stop remember that he saved my
life

  at her words the unfortunate old man
released his hold and sank weak and ex-
hausted into a chair

  oh what am i doing what am 
doing he moaned  im crazy with
grief and despair give me back my
formula watson and you shall leave
this house unharmed and unmolested

  tom struggled to regain his breath

   i swear to you dr green he
gasped  that i know nothing about the
disappearance of your formula i swear
to you that i have never opened that
safe you believe me do you not

   no said the old man  dont
believe you i believe that it was you

who stole my formula i believe you arc
i thief- a dirty contemptible sneaking
thief we took you in and befriended
you and this is how you repay us

  with a groan tom turned to the girl

   surely you wont refuse to believe
me miss angelina he cried surely
you can look in my face and read there
that i am telling you the truth i swear
to you that i am innocent of this awful
crime and as anxious as you and your
father to discover the thief you be-
lieve me dont you

   no retorted the girl her eyes
blazing with scorn   i dont believe you
mr watson i should like to have faith
in you but i cannot somebody who
knew that combination opened that safe
it must have been either my father or
yourself oh i was a fool to trust you-
a weak foolish girl i realize my mis-
take now

   so you realize it now do you
growled her father savagely you real-
ize it now when its too late you must
have been crazy girl-stark raving mad
-to give him that combination

   rut he seemed so loyal to us father
cried the girl sobbing afresh  lie
seemed so faithful that i wanted to how
my confidence in him

  tom groaned again

   confidence fiddlesticks snapped
the old doctor  why should you have
shown any confidence in him you silly
girl why should you have trusted him
lie was a stranger to you and strangers
are never to be fully trusted you knew
nothing about who he was or where he
came from we took him in without
asking any questions how do we know
even that his name is really what he says
it is for all we know he may be a
desperate criminal hiding from justicc

  tom winced

    wonder if he knows anything or
if that was just a chance remark he
thought  i wonder too who could
have opened that safe and stolen that
formula it couldnt have been jerry
the lag even if he recovered suffi-
ciently to be able to come here he didnt
know the combination

    at least im positive he didnt learn
it from me the table was too wide for
him to see the figures as i wrote them
even if he could read figures upside
tiie argosy

down and he certainly didnt get a
chanc e to see the paper afterward when
 left the room it was in crumbled ashes
which could have told nothing

   no it couldnt have been jerry the
lag then who on earth could have
done it it couldnt have been the old
man himself lie would have no reason
to steal his own formula and it could
not have been angelina

  ahi couldnt it though isnt it
possible despite her denial that she stole
that paper at the request of that scoun
drel darcy women will do anything
for those they love either she tolc it
for him or gave him the combination
and he stole it himself thats what
must have happened shes lying now
and accusing me to save herself and her
lover well i wont betray her

   shes trying to throw the blame on
me which plainly shows that she doesnt
love me and if she doesnt love me i
dont care what happens to me

  he was aroused from his reverie by
the angry voice of the old doctor

   well watson he said with forccd
calmness  ill give you just five minutes
to make up your mind either you re-
turn that formula to us in which case
you can leave here a free man and no-
body shall ever hear a word frm us
about your treachery or i will summon
the police and have you arrested for
theft

   it isnt necessary to summon the po-
lice doctor theyre here already said
a voice outside the door and to the sur-
prise of the doctor angelina and tom
chief johnson of the ben ford police
force entered the room followed by a
constable

   good morning said the chief pleas-
antly nodding to the doctor and ange-
lina  i presume this is my prisoner

  he fixed his keen eyes on tom

   whats your name mister   he asked
affably

   tom watson said tom

   no i dont mean your alias i mean
vour real name its tom robbins aint
it  

   what do you want of me growled
tom sullenly

   well personally i dont want any-
thing mr robbins said the chief
pleasantly  but  rather think that the

police of new york want you for bur-
glary and the police of pcckskill wants
you for arson so being as youre so very
much in demand  reckon ill have to
ask you to come along with me

   burglary and arson and his name
isnt watson after all gasped the as-
tonished doctor

  no replied tom bitterly my
name isnt watson my name is robbins
and im an ex-convict ive just finished
a four-year term in sing sing you
might as well know the truth you can
do what you like with me now i dont
carc

  an ex-convict gasped the doctor
and living under my roof oh my
god what a fool ive been you hear
what he says angelina perhaps you
realize now how crazy you were to en-
trust him with the combination of the
safe

  but angelina did not answer she
had fallen back in her chair in a dead
faint

chapter xv

a visit from darcy

    suprose this means a hundred
dollars reward to you remarked tom
robbins to chief johnson on their way
to the lockup

   i reckon it docs replied the police-
man with a chuckle  it will come
mighty handy too let me tell you

   would you mind answering me one
question chief asked torn

   that all depends upon the question
my friend

   who put you on my track ive
been living here for weeks ive passed
you on the street several times and you
never recognized me

   no-ill admit that you dont look
much like the picture they sent me and
your beard is very deceiving said the
chief apologetically

   very well then how did you dis-
cover me at last asked tom eagerly

   well thats n secret i rather guess
replied chief johnson

   you were tipped off by jerry the lag
were you not asked tom

  who on earth is jerry the lag
demanded the chief in surprise that was
the jailbird



evidently genuine  ive never heard tell
of him my friend

   maybe you dont know him by
name hes a rough looking fellow and
the cleverest burglar iu america just
now hes dressed like a tramp

   well it wasnt any tramp who tipped
me off as a matter of fact seeing that
youre so anxious to know i dont mind
telling you that i was put wise to you
by an anonymous letter received this
morning

  ah by an anonymous letter- the
crafty scoundrel i  muttered tom

   yes an anonymous letter-a letter
which said that i might in interested to
learn that the strange man who boards
with the ireem and who calls himself
tom watsoil is not tom watson at all
but tom robbins the fugitive from jus
tice

   i acted immediately upon receipt of
the information im not the kind of man
to let any grass grow under my feet you
understand of course  thought that
the letter was phony and that youd be
able to give a good account of yourself i
never expected that youd confess right off
that you were tom robbins and an ex-
convict im very grateful to you for
doing that my boy it has saved me a
lot of trouble

   and youve no idea where the letter
came from asked tom

   none whatever to tell you the
truth i dont care mi long as the infor-
mation it contained is correct

   well that letter undoubtedly came
from jerry the lag said tom
calmly  im glad tbat he was able to
write to you because tbat shows i didnt
kill him id bate to have a murder on
my hands maybe you beard about a row
in logans saloon last night chief 

   yes  did was the reply  so you
were mixed up in tbat too eh i met
logan this morning nnd he told me all
about it according to his story two
men -one a tramp and one apparently
respectable-went up stairs to the private
room and ordered several drinks of
whisky  suppose you were one of the
two men eh 

  tom nodded

   well logan says that the two men
were up-stairs for a short while and that
nobody paid any attention to either of

    	a

them in a little while one came down
and went out they heard him go out
but thought nothing of the fact tbat be
was alone

   well about twenty minutes after-
ward iogan says the other fellow the
tramp staggered heavily down-stairs and
logon met him on the stairway and no-
ticed that be was deathly pale and that
he was bleeding profusely about the head
from this fact iogan reckoned that there
must have been a fight perhaps you
wouldnt mind telling me what really did
happen

   nothing much replied tom
 logan was quite right we had
a quarrel and a fight and the other
man was worsted the other man was
jerry the iag so he left twenty minutes
after i did eh im glad to hear that
 thought that id killed him i reckon
he was only stunned where is he now
miles away by this time  reckon

    dont know said the chief shrug-
ging bis shoulders  if he isnt miles
away now hed lxrtier be before long if
he knows whats good for him i f he is
the desperate character you sav i wont
have him hanging around ben ford

  when they arrived at the jail tom was
turned over to the turnkey and locked
in a cell with plenty of time for reflection
ori his hands 

   so this is the end of all my good in-
tentions eh he muttered bitterly  if
i had carried out my original plan and
become a desperate crook so as to get my
revenge on society  couldnt have ended
up worse than this i suppose ill go to
sing sing again for the rest of my life
oh well let them do as they like with
me i dont care

   that old doctor was horrified when
he learned the truth and the girl fainted
 guess i shocked them serves them
right  want them to think the worst of
inc i want her to believe me a bad egg
what difference does it make to me what
they think the old doctor believes that
i stole his formula well let him be-
 ieve so

   their opinion good or bad doesnt
cut any ice with me  dont care a snap
of the lingers for cither of them fnther
or daughter theyre nothing to me

but despite his contemptuous words
in whatever direction the unfortunate man


the argosy

looked he could not escape the fancy
that he saw the reproachful eyes of
angelina gazing at him

    reckon  do care after all he
muttered with a lump in his throat  
reckon when it gets down to facts that
id ratlu-r have that girls respect than
anything else in the world well ive
lost it o whats the use of brooding over
the tiling i suppose i was born unlucky
and ith no use fighting against the in-
evitable

  an hour later however he was seized
with an idea

   i dont care what becomes of me
now he thought  they can send me

to prison for the rest of niv life if they

wish but i would like to clear myself
in her ayes id like to explain to her
about how i came to be sent to sing sing
i dont want her to think the worst of
me  suppose she regards me now with
horror and disgust id like to make her
believe that im not quite so bad as she
thinks me i wonder if shed come here
if  were to send her a note i might try
it anyway

  he called the turnkey

   say boss he said  is there any-
thing in the prison rules against my send
ing out a note to a friend

  humph no i guess not id have
to read the note first though replied the
turnkey

  dkar miss anchlina 

    believe me i am innocent of all they
  charge me with i have done time in
  prison imt i was sentenced unjustly i
  can explain it all would you grant me
  the groat favor f paying me a visit
  here before i am taken away to new
  york 

   i guess that will bring her he mut-
tered hopefully as he folded the note and
handed it through the bar to the turn-
key

  shell not refuse me this last request

i	came near losing my life trying to save
hers they cant deny that they cant
take that consoling thought away from
me out of gratitude for that she ought
to grant this last favor ill ever ask of
her

  for hours he waited in all agony of
impatjcncc fifty times at least he asked
the turnkey if the note had been properly
delivered

  suddenly bis heart beat rapidly with
joy and expectancy there were foot-
steps outside the cell and the turnkey ap-
proached

   theres a visitor to see you robbins
he announced

   bring her here quick please
begged tlie prisoner eagerly

   i didnt say it was a she its a lie
said the turnkey gruffly and tom uttered

                                       a cry of rage and disappointment as a
 thatll be all right tom took out mans face peered at him through the
a pencil and a piece of paper and wrote bars

the hawkins harvester

hy klkjak

                a diabolical invention of the
                an insensate desire to make

there was a long sweet stretch of
peaceful months during which i
nurtured the fond and foolish belief that
hawkins bad at last been forced from his
role of chief hoodoo to my own exist-
ence

  wealthy man genially inventive con-
structor of malevolent mechanical mad-
nesses though he be hawkins and i met
as strangers

 franklin

  conscienceless millionaire with
  tiling easy for hi fellow-men

    we still lived on the same block in
  new york we still trod the same pave-
  ments we still frequentlv rode down-
  town on business mornings on the same
   l  train but we never spoke as we
  passed by

    we never exchanged the smallest iciest
  of nods-albeit more than once i caught
  a wistful eye directed at me over the top
  of the inventors morning paper
the hawkins harvester



  at those moments i presume a well
grounded wonder was perambulating
hawkinss brain it is not every one who
can pass through the series of demon-
strations to which he treated me during
our past acquaintance - and then pull
out alive

  hawkins then seemed to realize that
there bar arisen between us a barrier
impassab and impregnable as a square
mfle of twelve-inch armor plate and the

bruises and abrasions on my person healed

up at last and life began to take on
much the same chcory aspect it had worn
before i encountered ilawkios and his
damnable inventions

  and then summer arrived

  hawkins you know has his country
home next to mine far up in the heart
of the massachusetts berkshire and
when you are at odds with your neighbor
in such a locality-and more particularly
when your wife is a friend of the enemys
wife-something very like uncomfortable
constraint is likely to arise

  by reason of which constraint per-
haps-the summer situation having been
endured for a matter of two or three
weeks-a wild spasm of christian for-
giveness suddenly gripped my heart on
that fateful brilliant afternoon

   forgiveness at least seems the prettiest
name for it it may have been plain
hysteria or a touch of the sun or the first
signs of cnilc decay whatever it was
it came abruptly and with marked force
and took the shape of a fixed decision to
forgive hawkins

  i	would go to him and forgive him
coldly and formally if he expressed
dep contrition  would add a few kind
words and leave and after that the
greater distance that remained between
us for the rest of time the better the
annoying constraint would at least be re-
moved

  by some accident on the hired mans
part the tanks of my touring-car had been
filled that morning i cranked the motor
and climbing in beaded for hawkinss

  ii	is a very small run in a matter of
five minutes  was rolling up hawkinss
drive ami with something of an internal
chill was tooting the horn in the old
familiar way

  a startled maid appeared she looked
at me she rubbed her eyes and said

  the-ladies have gone driving mr
jriggs they wont be-back until eve-
ning

   announced that i was after mr

hawkins himself the young woman
permitted herself a gulp and-

   mr hawkins-mr hawkins has
gone over to the hayes farm sir if-
you want to see him youd better hurry
 eh  

   yes sir hes been gone some time
now and--and he may not be there long
and-

  her voice seemed to fade the girl
herself backed into the doorway i gave
a final stare at her she disappeared and
perhaps with something of a grunt i sent
the car down the other drive and along
the road again

  what on earth was hawkins doing at
hayess place-the biggest farm in the
county had he pickcd hayes as a new
victim or- i dropped speculation in
ail absent-minded study of the scenery

  tt would be just as easy to forgive
hawkins on somebody elses property as
on his own little as that might be saying

  ten minutes more of easy going and i
came up the long approach to hayess
solid old farmhouse

  the wide old vine-clad veranda was
there i would line up beside it and
make inquiry for hawkins i would de-
liver the oration that was already begin-
ning to stick in my throat and- from
behind the vines rushed a too too familiar
figure

  it was hawkins-hawkins coming
down the three steps with brilliant smile
and outstretched hand straight for my
machine and from his lips came

  griggs

  i straightened up and stepped out i
squared my chest and took a long breath
as i began impressively

  hawkins i-

  griggs not another word cried
the inventor joyously  not one single
word i forgive you absolutely and
completely no

  my lips had opened again

   its all right old man i wont hear
an apology or the hint of an apology
griggs youve acted like a chumpand
you know it now-and well let bygones
be bygones and consider the whole thing
dead buried and forgotten now


tiie argosy

come up here and have a glass of hayess
cider  

  he wrung my hand again and waited
breathlessly for my part i leaned
against the car and tried to get a limp
lower jaw bark into place so  was for
given -

   and youve arrived exactly at the
psychological moment ilawkins bab-
bled on happily  youve come when-
hawkins stopped short for a second
or two he listened intently then with a
startled little cry he dodged for the
sheltered recesses of the porch-and i
followed with a single leap

  and from somewhere to the rear of the
house had come a sudden wild neighing-
a galloping and then a thundering of
hoofs-and down past the house raced
hayess big mare traveling at perhaps a
fraction of a second less than a mile a
minute

  she was taking no account of possible
obstacles her whole mind and energy
seemed bent on tearing the top layer from
the drive in her course to the public high-
way

  at her heels came a colt shrieking
rather than neighing like a normal horse
and pounding great clods into the air
behind him

  and then they were gone-gone down
the highway in an impenetrable cloud of
white dust and as hayes himself ap-
peared and raced wildly after them
hayess hired man suddenly shot into
view he whizzed dazedly around the
corner of the house he tripped  he fell
he slid to a wild kicking standstill at the
foot of the steps

  iike a rubber ball be bounccd to his
feet again he staggered wildly about
for an instant then he confronted haw-
kins nnd mouthed as he dug at the
gravel in his eyes 

   you-you-better come up quick
mister shes steamin t beat the band
an the critters is nigh crazy skeered
that there mare-

  hawkins stiffened for an instant then
relaxed with a roar

   didnt  tell you to call me as soon
as the gage went to six pounds you con-
founded- lie broke off and leaped
into my machine  let us up to the
barn griggs quick

   suppose it was the fatal instinct re-

turning to inc i obeyed swiftly j and
perhaps thirty seconds later shut down
the power suddenly before the table

  hawkins was gone almost before we
stopped-gone into the barn at a gallop
and that usually placid structure was
surely worth observation

  from the cracks in the sides from the
cracks in the roof from the open door and
windows came cloud upon cloud of
steam from the door also came a tre-
mendous hissing and from the depths
of the place as the hissing stopped ab-
ruptly came

  got hold of those horses henry
all right sure of it griggs
yes i answered faintly

   back your car away about a hundred
feet and then get out and come here 
again i obeyed-and again instinct
aided me a little  i ran the motor behind
the stone wall of the adjoining field
after which  approached the barn slowly
-and came to a dead standstill

  for there was a strange chug-chug
within the structure now the doors
swung open and through them came
what seemed to be the cream of all haw-
kinss inventive nightmares

  fully nine feet in height the unholy
contrivance seemed to combine the exter-
nal details of a traction-engine a steam-
roller without the rollers a flying
machine with skeleton wings a col-
lapsible hay-rake-and there was a strong
hint of the ordinary auto-truck in the big
red body at the rear

  in the middle seemed to be the boiler
beside it a saddle and possibly sixty five
or seventy levers and valvc-handlc and
gages and in the saddle sat ilawkins
keen eyed and smiling tensely

   out of the way a little griggs  he
called  she may slide a bit-

  the warning wa not exactly neces-
sary a fragment or two of wits had
returned and  was standing on the wall
by the car even before bis words ceased
and the dear familiar smile of super-
cilious contempt came to his lips

  he pulled another one or two of his
levers the contrivance came down the
little incline with a rush and a bounce
hawkins pulled again and the thing
stopped beside me with a jerk that sent
its engineers arm around the smoke-stack
and brought a grunt from his throat
the iiawkins harvester



  i-ic straightened up again on the in-
stant however and eyed me with a smile
as he announced

  griggsi the hawkins harvester
   hawkins-

   the salvation of the general farmer
-the eliminator of farm labor the
blessed simplifying element of future ag-
riculture look you catch the general
idea of the thing at first glance of
course  

  he waited for no denial

   primarily she drives herself-the
farm-horse wiped out of existence next
every operation takes place from the
saddle here the farmer himself runs it
alone-and the farmhand i wiped out
too

   and last hut best the machine will
plow harrow plant mow rake reap
and bind every product of the field and
finally cither pack it in the barn for
winter or cart it automatically to the
nearest market whether it he two or two
hundred miles distant from the harvest
field 

   hawkins- i began again

  the inventors back was turned to me
his voice rang out cheerily

   now ill throw all the details out
into view as they would be in action
watch

  i watched i was rather too thunder-
struck to do anything but watch and
as i watched it seemed that i dreamed of
a farm-supply catalogue or that  had
been dropped into a wholesale farm-
supply salesroom recently jarred by an
earthquake

  a clank and what was unquestionably
a tremendous mowing-machine apparatus
shot out on the side nearest me another
clank and a correspondingly huge hay-
rakc hung over it a third accompanied
this time by an uncanny rattling of chains
and a vast net-work of heavy iron came
into view and hawkins called proudly
 thats the complete reaping and bind-
ing apparatus over there griggs picks
up and bundles everything in sight with-
out jarring a single whcat-bcrry out of
its pod now well see the triple hladed
plow and the harrow and-

  hey mr hawkins

  i turned with the inventor between
us stood llayes himself his face was
smeared with perspiration and dust his

person seemed to have accumulated much
of the highway and his breath was nearly
gone but through all the grime shone
the might of a righteous mans anger

   mr hawkins he roared  you aint
going t try that there thing here to-day
er any other day i  got all i want of it
now that derned mare o mines gone-
and shell break her neck before she ever
gits back not t mention killin the colt 

   why hayes- gasped hawkins

  thats all right i i know yeve paid
me good money t let yer build the blasted
thing in my barn over winter and t keep
it secret an ive let yer dratted mechan-
ics eat me outer house an home fer five
dollars a week an ive had the barn all
messed up with tools an grease an set
on fire twice with yer forge but-

  interesting details seemed to be com-
ing the hawkins harvester had a past
i listened intently

   but this is too derned much   hayes
was continuing  you git the crazy en-
gine offcn this place an if i ever see it
back here -

  hawkins as it were was standing in
his saddle

   hayes he declaimed coldly   have
paid you at your own figure for everything
 have received a verbal contract is per-
fectly legal whether you know it or not
and our agreement was that i was to make
a trial trip over that ten-acre hay field
to-day cut and rake the entire field and
bind a certain small portion of it into
bundles by way of experiment

   then you can consider her canceled
mr hawkins  aint going-

   on the contrary came in ice drops
from hawkins the demonstration is
going to continue out of the way
please

  look here you shrieked mr
hayes

  the harvester gave a roar of steam
that sent both of us several feet farther
from its interesting mechanism one tre-
mendous clatter of iron and steel extend
ins over thirty seconds and mower and
rake and binder had folded up placidly
and the wheels of the machine itself were
moving

  hawkins if you dare- the
farmers voice was drowned in steam

  hawkins i pleaded loudly

  the harvester merely swung around


the argosy

and with a good deal more grace than
one could have exported it was hound
for that big hay-field on the other bide
of the barn and heaven have mercy
on the innn who sought to delay it

  it swung quickly through the gateway
and into the mass of waving hny as haw-
kins called out to me 

  griggs note every detail of the
working 

  for the moment i was ignoring the
harvester hayes himself appealed to me
as vastly more interesting

  as concerns outward and visible mani-
festations of white-hot rage  have never
seen anything to equal mr hayes at that
moment his complexion even through
the dirt was that of arctic snow his
eyes glittered like sparks from an electric
welder his breath came in spasmodic
gasps and his hands opened and closed

with a queer series of sr tps as the har-
vester swept into the big field and lowered
its mowing-machine

   an arter all ive stood the derncd
fools goln t ruin that hull field an the
iord knows how much more an-

  hawkins was working close to the
wall incidentally his knives were blithe-
ly clipping oil dozens of wild raspberry
bushes and hurling them into the next
pasture hayess breath came in a last
long whistle

   and he aint goin t do no more
by heck  he roared

  hayes started for the barn i started
for hawkins its a horrible hideous
thing to see a man killed in cold blood 
and if ever a mortal looked bent on mur-
der it was hayes

  therefore i made after hawkins at
top speed he was at the other end of
the hay-field now he hail very literally
cut a swath and one some fifteen feet
wide

  at the momeni he was engaged iu turn-
ing his strange engine  and before i came
up with him the harvester was rushing
down upon me and tossing hay to the four
winds

  hawkins removed his hat with a polite
triumphant bow

  anything on earth to beat it he
queried in a bellow

  hawkins i i screamed get out
of here-get your machine out of here i
that man is after you liell lc here

in a second and the lord knows what
hell do i get away before-

  the harvester paused momentarily
hawkinss sardonicgnufaced me around
the corner of the smoke stack

   my dear cjriggs lie said serenely
  am perfectly aware of my exact rights
iu this as in every other case there are
many things that i shall explain later
but here and now let me assure you that
i know what i am doing and if hayes
elects to get just a little bit gayer hell
pay me cold cash for having this field
mowed automatically and raked over or
-holy moses griggs

  i stared at him hawkins was stand-
ing iu his saddle once more and glaring
wide-eyed toward the barn

  say he gasped that-that
fools gone mad in good earnest  he-
i turned swiftly and i made tracks
for another portion of the field for
hayes was approaching with a gleaming
pitchfork of size that exceeded the normal
almost as completely as did the harvester
itself his eye was even wilder than
before  his fingers were clenched lovingly
around the handle and as lie raced up
lie thundered 

   atow youll get out 

  hayes i warn you- hawkins
screamed

  and the scream rose suddenly to a
shriek of agony for the big tines seemed
to have found some part of his anatomy
and the sinister voice added 

  you get that thing out of here alive
cr ill do it after youre dead 

  i was going to cover my eyes i could
not too many things were happening
at once for a start there was a wild hiss
of steam from the harvester and a clank-
ing and hayes went down with a crash

  lie was up in an instant gripping his
pitchfork anew and as lie did so the
harvester started with a jerk and a roar

  hayes went after it hawkins looked
back the harvester quickened its pace
and hayes quickened his and the odds
were rather more than even money on
hayes and the pitchfork

  hawkins seemed to realize it his
arms swung in wild panic for a second or
two then his hands began to tug at
levers in a wild effort to ccape

  there seemed to be something of the
desired result the harvester shot ahead
the hawkins harvester



at very creditable speed it was a good
conscientious harvester too and it did
more

  with a deafening crash it let down its
huge hayrake  and hawkins looked back
in frenzied amazement and dragged at
more of bis mechanism

  the harvester responded obligingly by
unlimbering its huge binder and wheels
and bands and racks began to clatter and
spin frantically

   in the saddle apparently there wns an-
other struggle the sole result was that
three tremendous plow-bladcs appeared
suddenly lefore the machine dug them-
selves into the ground and took to
tearing up cart loads of loose dirt and
hay

  and then the harrow-ah the harrow i
that decided to appear almost instantly
in a matter of seconds it was engaged in
gathering hay and earth clods and hurling
them about in a happy indiscriminate
care-free way

  hayes staggered backward perhaps
he realized that the hawkins harvester
had become unmanageable perhaps he
did not at all events he merely stared
and mouthed for the moment

  a man with a battery of gatling guns
might have attacked the harvester safely
from a distance hayes possessed only a
puerile pitchfork with the ilawkins
harvester plunging wildly toward the
bars of the young fruit orchard hayes
made a wide detour for the barn and
for another short space i forgot him

  for that harvester was enough to ab-
sorb the attention of a dozen men it
seemed entirely happy now although the
gifted inventor had been again reduced
to clutching the hot belching smoke-stack
as he directed his great eyes at me

   griggs  he shrieked above the din
the-things gone- wrong you get
in front and jump up here on this bar
and-

  his breath left him in a single violent
puff

  the harvester had tried to eschew bars
and leap the barbed-wirc fence to the
orchard as a consequence - perhaps
merely as a tiny joke-it removed some
dozen feet of fencc hurled it into the
binder converted it into a compact little
bundle and threw it straight at me

  i dodged rapidly the harvester

oarecrcd ingenuously onward and haw-
kins soenied to lose interest in me as he
tugged and twirled at the steering-wheel

  and he did accomplish something be-
fore his course altered the mower had
removed just seven of hayess choicest
young plum trees and filliped them to-
ward the binder the binder responded
almost in blasi fashion by bundling them
without an effort and kicking them into
the air

  a roar of despair escaped hawkins
he stared back he stared forward and
i held my breath

  now it was coming he was going to
miss the bars that led out of the orchard
and toward the house he was going
to strike tbat stone wall and go to eternal
smash 

  he struck it and there was no smash
for the harvester merely plowed that
cemented stone wall out of its path and
pitched angrily at the hedge beside the
path

  it was a good strong hedge but it went
like the proverbial chaff twenty sec-
onds and hayess ten years growth was
cut and bundled neatly and thrown by the
roadside and the harrow reached back
and gave it a violent kick by way of good
measure

  somehow as i tagged behind at dan-
gerously close range a daze came over
me in a matter of five or six minutes-
counting out the mare and her colt-that
harvester must have done at least two or
three hundred dollars worth of actual
damage nnd it was still going

  nay it was moving at rapidly increas-
ing speed and even more it was headed
straight for the ilayes homestead

  suppose it should hit the house amid-
ships there was no reason to assume
that it wouldnt remove the aged founda-
tions and tear down the walls and then-
hut its course had changed suddenly

  with a mad chorus of panting snorts
the harvester veered a trifle and made
for that beautiful side porch with nil its
vines nnd its lattice work and its slender
columns

  and then-it seemed to be over in a
second almost

  the plow-blades removed theunder-
pinning neatly the columns and the
flooring came down with a roar that sug-
gested the san francisco earthquake


the argosy

ilaycs appeared suddenly around the
corner of the house as the harvester made
a futile lunge at the outdoor kitchen and
decided tostccr for the smoke house

  he was carrying something in his
hand and  had not superintended the
blasting on my own property to mistake
the something

  it was dynamite in sticks and one of
them was raised over his head 

  and somehow forgetting home and
family and all i rushed madly at the
harvester and bellowed

  jump hawkins i jump hes going
to blow you up jump for heavens
akc i jump clear and-

  hawkins arose and gave one wild look
backward his teeth shut he stood
fairly upon the saddle for an instant-
then he hew through the air and cleared
the entire mechanism to roll helplessly at
my feet

   had no attention to give him the
harvester was roaring onward a dozen
yards distant with hayes trotting deter-
minedly after it the big stick utill up-
raised

  then he paused suddenly he watched
the affair skim by his smoke-house and
his arm went up higher and the stick
flew up through the air-and the earth
seemed to open suddenly and throw
forth plows and harrows and mowing-
machines in a single burst of flame and-

  i think that quite a space must have
elapsed because both dr brotherton and
the constable must have come all the way
from the county town

  brotherton was just removing a hot
bandage from my forehead as i opened
my eyes and sat up he surveyed me
with a grin and 

   well youre not dead griggs any
woy hut id steer clear of having my
head collide with a two-hundred pound
plow-hladc hereafter

   am i-hurt  

   not sos youd notice it responded
the doctor  there are no bones broken
- dont know why able to drive your
car home

  several blinks at the sunshine and i
announced the probability of such a
proceeding then i began to look at
hawkins sitting on the porch-steps with
a bandage or two in evidence and with

the constable on one side and hayes on
the other

   hawkins is settling up-in fact i
believe he has settled up to the tune of
several hundred cold plunks murmured
brotherton dryly  he decided to avoid
arrest and-

  hawkins had risen and was coming
toward us uncertainly his face was
whke and pained but distinctly ugly

   ill get your car griggs brotherton
suggested as he strolled up the lane to-
ward the barn

   well theyve mulcted me hawkins
observed fiercely  theyve trimmed me
for just seven hundred dollars on a
blackmailing threat of arrest griggs
theyve insisted on my-

the car was bowling gently toward us
 hawkins i said  be thankful that
they didnt stick you with a knife or that
hayes didnt hurl another dynamite stick
at you or-

  ah thats where ive got him
said the inventor hoarsely  thats the
count thatll take him through every
court in this state five thousand dol
lars all told i spent on that machine and
he dared-

  gently but firmly i placed hawkins in
the motor he seemed to rebound he
stood erect and roared toward hayes

   to-morrow morning-

  then he sat down suddenly

  a carriage was coming up behind us
a lady was in the carriage and the
widening whites of her eyes were visible
as she stared at hayess home

  really there was much to see there
was the place where the porch had been 
there was a deep hole in the ground and
the few standing bits of the smoke-house 
there were pieces of iron and steel frag-
ments of belts and cog-wheels and levers
and chains and great chunks of boiler-
plate and big driving-wheels-the whole
with a frieze of vnlvc handles and smaller
steel rods

  the lady continued to stare and slow-
ly her gaze wandered to my mochinc as
i murmured

   your wife hawkins 

  without a sound hawkins slid to the
floor of the automobile from the depths
behind me came a faint wailing noise

   home griggs for the lords sake
home  your home  
easiest thing in the world

by john h fkeesb

                    the strange adventure that befell a new yorker
                    on hi way to dine with a friend in brooklyn

this telephone hell rang vicjously
and the editor wheeled impatiently
in his swivel-chair whenever he was
especially busy that telephone always
went on a rampage i he slipped the re-
ceiver from the hook and waited

  well he snapped after receiving
no word

  the blood coursed slowly to his head
some day he was going to be stricken
with apoplexy while holding this same
receiver to his car the buzz of the
vacant wire aggravated his ear-drum
he jabbed angrily at the hook for a full
minute then waited again

  number please

  the voice was soft and sweet but had
no power to propitiate him he knew
that central was chewing gum

  number he cried here you
rung this phone like mad and bother the
life out of me until i answer it and then
you ask me what i want i want you
to connect me with the party you cut me
off from

  lie slapped his fist upon the table to
emphasize the words as if she could see
him

   ill try to get them again the un-
ruffled young woman sweetly responded

  after an interminable wait her voice
came soothingly to his burning car
number please

   number the editor was strangling
in his wrath  i told you that-

   oh replied the voice reproachfully
 i forgot to tell you didnt i  i
couldnt find it

   give me the manager ill see
whether he can find it

   managers out she curtly an-
swered

   you mean you wont let me talk with
the manager he roared

   managers out call tip again

  the editor slapped the receiver back
upon the hook from a peaceably in

dined man he had been transformed in
one short moment into a raging breath
of destruction

  he hammered until his knuckles achcd
upon the ofiicc door next his own but no
answer came fuming still more he
paced angrily across the hall and pushed
open the door of his assistant

  whats the matter john the
young man looked in amazement at his
superiors purpled visage

  can i use your telephone the edi-
tor answered  i want to get the man-
ager of central and the girl wont give
him to me

   help yourself and the assistant
motioned him to a chair

   tin g -a- ling - a-ling-a - ling br-r-r-r r

ting-a-litig

   thats your phone i think the
young man remarked just as he was ta-
king down the receiver

  the editor made about three bounds in
reaching his own room

   hallo  he roared

  hallo is that you john a
voice he recognized well balled him  i
want you to conic over to dinner to-
night its very important

   who arc you  the editor inquired
out of sheer perversity

   dont you know me the voice was
surprised  im frank

   frank who

  if he couldnt get the manager he
would make some one uncomfortable at
any rate

   frank sommers we dine at eight
 oh h frank he had to be
pleasant now im awfully busy old
man he hesitated

   well youve got two hours to dreis
and get over here ill bet youre only
reading a manuscript that can wait till
to morrow come on be a good fel-
low and hurry along its really impor-
tant




the argosy

   but im interested in this manu-
script i want to finish it to-night

  interested in a manuscript the
friend inquired suspiciously  i didnt
know editor ever got interested in manu-
scripts well read it on your way over
here

   what is there so important about
my coming the editor wanted to know

   why a friend of lucys dropped in
from chicago to-day and shes thinking
of staying here she wants to write
lucy and i both thought it would be a
mighty good idea to let her hear your
advicc on the subject you see shes be-
come discouraged and intends going home
to-morrow

   thats a good idea the editor re-
marked  thats what i would advise
tell her so and how sorry i am that-

   nonsense this girl can write good
stories and theres no sense in her drop-
ping it because youre too lazy to come
over here lucy would never forgive
you

   but the editor remonstrated  you
know i always have the very dickens of a
time getting around in brooklyn

   easiest thing in the world his
friend scoffed with that assurance and
civic pride that is the birthright of every
man living across the river from man-
hattan  you just take the elevated at
the bridge and get off at greene street
then you walk two blocks straight
ahead turn to the left and there you
are

   where  sarcastically

   at my place of course second
house from the corner

   what corner 

   listen resumed the brooklynite pa-
tiently  ill go over it again and if
theres anything that puzzles you just
interrupt me you take the elevated-

   what elevated  

   nostrand avenue you get off at
the greene street station and walk
ahead 

  ahead of what 	

  ahead ahead in the direction
you would have gone on in the car if you
hadnt got off then you turn to the
left and my house is the second from
the corner

  what corner

   northeast just ask any one and

hell tell you where frank sommers
lives do you understand

   yes-s the editor assented dubious-
ly but i wish youd hold the wire
till  make a note of it

  lie repeated the directions as he had
taken them down on his little writing-
pad and found them satisfactory

  again he picked up the manuscript
and tried to read hut found the story
had lost its savor if there was one
thing he hnted to do worse than another
it was going to brooklyn still he had
promised nnd the time was drawing near

  barring accidents he would nrrivc at
seven consequently as he had never
journeyed across without accidents he

thought he had better he hastening

slipping the manuscript into his coat he
hurried to his hotel where he changed to
evening dress and descended the subway
stairs in the next block

  the rush was on when he struggled
up the stairs of the bridge thousands
and thousands fought to gain the multi-
tudinous platforms where the cars waited
to take them across  nostrand ave-
nue nostrand avenue john weldon
kept repeating over nnd over as he was
carried off his feet and up the steps tie
breathed a sigh of relief nr nt last he felt
the river air strike ills face

  it was a labor of some moments ex-
tracting a promise from the guard to
call him at his station but when he had
finally succeeded he breathed a sigh of

relief and a great load seemed lifted off
his mind the car gradually dropped
its passengers until there was a vacant
seat in the center into which the editor
dropped completely fagged out  is
station was almost the last on the line
and in searching about for something to
while awav the time he bethought him
of the manuscript he had brought along
to read during the trip

  it was a thrilling story a new story
a story such as it was seldom his good
luck to read a far removed from the
tired cut and dried things the profes-
sionals submitted to him as night was
from day weldon reveled in its fresh-
ness and vivacity he even enjoyed the
earmarks of the novice that occasion-
ally cropped out

  ile must find this man--george wil-
son he wanted more stories like this
 easiest thing

in the world



one breathlessly lie was carried along
wiih the tale

  the author called it  the pursuit
and it was the tale of the escape of an
innoccnt convict from the new york
tombs the detective is always close
on his heels he has pursued him from
one end of the city to the other the
editor had just reached a point where it
seems impossible for the man to get
away

  weldon glanced up from the story
the car was empty save for a woman in
the forward end  i must be almost
there he told himself

  he would only finish the page he was
now half way down and then he would
put the thing aside temporarily

  a harp gust of wind fluttered through
the open window at his side and snatched
the flimsy sheet from his hand with a
little gesture of impatience lie leaned
over and reached for it

  the tantalizing thing seemed pos-
sessed by some imp of mischief for every
time he would get his fingers on it away
it would go again the cramped spacc
between the seats gave him no choice
but to squeeze himself down between
them and thus get enough elbow room
to tapture the leaf with a sigh of re-
lief he felt the ends of the paper crum-
ple in his hands and lie drew it in

  there was a blinding flash of light
and something like an explosion wel-
don started and lookvd about him

  the car was in absolute darkness
grumblingly he laid down the story
here he was within a few blocks at
least of his destination and an accident
had to occur with the patience of the
born new yorker ready to put up with
anything pertaining to miserable train
service he waited silently

  he drew his watch from his pocket
and tried to make out the time it was
too dark with a sigh he replaced it
and again proceeded to bide his soul in
patience after what seemed to him an
interminable period lie revolted and
guiding himself by the seats wended a
cautious way to the platform of the car
to find out what had happened

  the guard was gone likewise the mo-
torman as he was on the forward car
he decided the accident must be in
he rear boinewhere and accordingly

walked through car after car they
were all empty as the grave-and dark
accordingly

  hi- raised his voice and shouted for
a trainman to tell him what was the
trouble the only sound that came back
was the echo of his own dismal voice

  he reached over to a window and
threw it wide he thrust his head out
and looked up and down the track

  a shudder passed through him they
had shunted him into the yards prob-
ably for the night he had evidently
been on one of the extras requisi-
tioned for the nightly rush the story
that was probably why the guard had
overlooked him possibly at the cxaet
moment the man had ordered all out of
the train he weldon had been under
the seat hunting the sheet of paper and
the guard not seeing him had taken it
fur granted that he had alighted at
greene street

  the editor looked dolefully about him
the car had rounded a sharp curve a
few hundred feet down the road and the
tiny glitter of the electric lights there
caught his eye their radiance was to-
tally inadequate to illuminate anything
about him but they threw a glare upon
the multitude of shining rails that wound
away in every direction like huge ser-
pents of the night

  there seemed to be a thousand rails and
a hundred cars here oars-cars-cars
-everywhere nothing but cars and rails
raising his voice he hailed the dark
dismal things there was no answer

  there was no use staying here so he
strayed again to the platform there
was only one thing to do and that was
to get off and walk back to a station-
how far that was he knew not

  he looked meditatively down when
a sudden recollection made him shrink
and draw away

  the third rail how many many
times lie had read of the havoc and death
lurking in that innocent-appearing bit
of metal

   innocent  that was what the news-
papers always called them he looked
about for an innocent rail they seemed
about as w-icked to him as a thing
could be

  he shook his head sadly none of
the rails looked innocent to him


the argosy

  the ulosquitocs hissed and stung and
whirred about there had been a plague
of them the lat wck anything was
better than this he must get to the
railing somehow nd call down to the
people on the street

  gingerly dropping from the last step
he planted himself between a pair of
rails that bristled threateningly about
him and figured on the distance to the
hcantling that injunded the elevated
structure on his right lie could not
count the tracks that intervened most
of them glittered and glimmered in the
electric light but there was another
which he had good reason to suspect did
not show itself-the innocent third rail

  gingerly he threaded his way across
to the right every time he stepped on
an unusually crackly piece of cinder in
the road-bed lie jumped he wondered
if the third rail made a noise

  tlie editor felt very sorry for himself
during that thrilling excursion he
wondered what his friends would say
could they see him trying to keep his
faith with frank sommers and braving
death to do it

  he wondered whether they would
blame frank fr enticing him over to
brooklyn when he hadnt wanted to go-
and hoped they wouldnt he had for-
given him out of the fulness of his over-
sowing heart and he trusted his friends
and relatives would do likewise

  it was his own fault he argued this
trip he should have been strong and
steadfast and refused to go he owed
it to himself as well as others hut lie
had been thoughtless and was reaping
his -reward if he didnt hit tlie fencc
first

  r-r-r-r-r-r  the editor jumped a
new danger another train was being
run into this desolate waste he could
not see which track it was on because of
the sharpness of the curve ahead one
thing he knew and that was that this
was no place for him

  the third rail was momentarily for-
gotten and lie bounded over the tracks
with an agility he had not mustered
since his childhood days livery moment
he expected to see a blinding headlight
bearing down upon him  every instant
he fully expected to-

  crash he stumbled forward and

gave a yell of terror he felt himself
living through space with a wild swing
of his arms he clutched the wooden rail-
ing and hung to it trembling in every

muscle

  his foot ached fearfully he looked
down at his shoe and found the tip of
it dented and crushed it was the toe
with the corn on it it was not the third
rail after all but a raised track lie had
caught his pump iu

  he leaned over the guard-rail and
gazed longingly down into the street
there were not many people abroad
but still anything would serve

  he raised his voice and shouted no
one paid any attention finally his
heart gave a mighty bound as in answer
to one of his calls a woman stopped

  site carried a large bundle tied up in
a huge sheet evidently she was a
washerwoman but that made no differ-
ence to the editor

  he yelled again-this time louder
than before she turned her head to the
right to fnc left looked intently at the
ground then started on her way des-
perately he shouted once more again
she stopped and repeated her process of
searching

  weldon fairly howled as she started
off t his time she glanced in the right
direction she caught his agonized white
face peering down at her and rushed un-
der the pillars

  hallo yelled the editor unfath-
omable relief in his voice

  harsh and faint rose the answer

   ye dirtily omadhaun whnt are yez
callin afther a dacint woman fer

  she shook her fist wrathfully at him

   i cant get down weldon yelled
seeing her misinterpretation of his mo-
tives

   sure an its not mesilf thats askin
yez t get down she retorted  divil
a word did oi say t vez till ve splioke
furst

   i dont want to talk with you he
explained in a hoarse tone  i want to
get down

   then wot were yez afther pakin t
me fer 

   i-i- for heavens sake he
cried in despair  im stuck here
wont you please get me down

   sure an its mesilf that wuz nlver
easiest thing

in tiik world



much of a climber and she glanccd re-
gretfully at the pillars

   tell homebody im up here

  ill tell mr- irmly when oi got
home she reassured him

   but a woman rant help me down 
lie was in utter despair by now

   shell be aftber tollin mike her
husband shure hes th sthrongest bye
in brooklyn hell get yez down

   when will you see her hope re-
newed sprang within weldons sore
heart

  if oim not very late wid me

fur-rst thing in th mor-rnin

  the woman shouldered her bundle
anti was walking off when be again
hailed her

  for heavens sake call a man on
the street i dont want to stay here
and take my chances of youre not fin-
ishing your washing to-night

  she put down the bundle and bared
her arms combatively

   an if it werent fcr me rheumatiz
an me sixty years she cried  id be
aftber climbin up there just t bate
yez 

  why whats the matter cried
weldon in surprise  what in the
world have i done to offend you  

   call a man on th sthrcct  she
cried  an is it bridget mcciarrity
has t listen t any one tollin her t spake

t a sth range man

   but for my sake  he pleaded

  ill have yez t know that oim a
lady she snatched up her bundle
and made as if to leave then turned to
throw a parting shaft over her shoulder
 an no gintu man would suggest to a
lady t spake t a man she never set oiyes
 afore

  the editor razed sadly after her de-
parting form she wung along the
walk with the outraged dignity of a god-
dess weldon had lost even the chance
of mikes coming around now

  again he searched the horizon for
some one to assist him he had used up
so much of his voice in talking with the
wash-lady that he must husband this
bis only recourse he resolved to de-
pend on men thereafter the question
of etiquette and the proprieties due from
a man on a siding some fifty feet in the

 air was one of which he had never made
 a study

  a policeman strutted past swinging
 his billy aimlessly his coat was open
 and his hat reposed on the back of his
 head here nt last was the very man
 to call

  weldon raised jii voice frantically
 the officer stopped and looked ill every
 direction

   why thought the editor  cant
 they look here first for once

  again he yelled nnd this time the po-
 liceman glanced up

  an expression of utter bewilderment
 overspread his rubicund countenance
 he scratched his head and sauntered un-
 der the pillars

  clearly be was not a man to deal with
 an emergency again he gazed at the
 figure silhouetted against the sky

   hallo yelled the editor

  the shout seemed to bring the officer
 to his senses for he flourished bis stick
 wildly

  come down out o there  he called
 commnndingly

   i cant

  the answer seemed to enrage him

   come down out o there he said
 more threateningly  come on now i 

   i cant get down the editor an-
 swered pacifically  im stuck here

   ill run yu in fer resistin au officer
 if ye dont come down

   how can i resist you when im up
 fiftv feet in the air 

   vure rcfusin t olev

   i cant obey

   ill run yuin

   all right weldon was now com-
pletely adrift from his temper  i dont
carc a hang what you do withme if
youll only get me down

   ill get yu down all right enough
 the policeman responded grimly

   well thats all i want

   an if i cant ill call out th force
 the angry cop continued  yu cant
 come that game wid me 

   call the force then i want to get
 down

   yure resistin arrest

  the policeman glanced dubiously
about it was seldom a man had the ef-
frontery to dare him and the rest of the
police force in this manner


the argosy

   you comc on down now i  he cried
again

   youre a fool  snapped the editor
 what do you suppose id be here for
if i could get down for my health

   dont get gay it was the invari-
able retort of a befuddled brain

   why dont you ring up the reserves
or tell the trainmen theres some one on
the siding that cant get off theyll
send a car along and take me down

   come on now dont give me any
more o yer lip the man bellowed ill
run yu in fer swipin juice first thing
you know

   for what   surely this wns n most
bewildering charge to bring against an
inoffensive citizen whose only crime was
being marooned among railway tracks

   swipin juice thats what the
rop continued triumphantly yuu
get ten years fer that

  what is it though inquired the
editor

  the penalty that he would find meted
out to him was suddenly dwarfed by the
philological instinct that made him long
to know what was meant by the dastard-
ly crime of  swipin juic

   what is what growled the cop

   swipin juice

   comc on now dont tell me yurc
there because yu want t be- yu
  tell you iin up here because  want
to be  surely of all amazing twists of
fancy this was the most marvelous
 im up here because a great big block-
head of a cop cant think of how to get
me down why you havent enough
brains to-to-

  the editor paused at a loss for an
adequate invective to hurl at the man be-
low he had to content himself with
impotcntly shaking his fist

   i cant get yu down eh

  the officer was so enraged by the
taunts that he was almost dancing about
the pillar in his frenzy somehow he
was inimitably like a small fox terrier
that has treed a squirrel

   ill show yu whether  can or not

   then do it you big chump you
dont know enough even to call a car
out i 

   yure under arrest fer wipin juice
an resistin an officer in the discharge of
his duties i  the policeman howled

  just a moment please the editor
 held up his hand impressively  you
 may not be aware of it but there are
 lilel laws in this country and ill sue
 you when  get down for accusing me
 of -of- he turned helplessly and
 looked about him for inspiration  swi-
 pin juice he ended feebly

    thats- no libel

   well if it isnt id like to know
 what i

   that only tappin th third rail

   exactly what im trying not to do
 the editor assured him emphatically

  then what else are yu doin there

  trying to get down 

   yure tappin th third rail posi-
 tively

   i dont even know which the third
 rail is i havent even touched it

   well you dont want to respond-
 ed the policeman grimly  id run yu
 in fer commitin suicide an a nuisance
 if yu did

   youd arrest me for every crime in
 the almanac wouldnt you

    would

   which is the third rail

    the third one of course

  third from vfhich direction from
 this scantling or the one on the other
 side 

   why do you want to find it asked
 the policeman

    want to know so i wont find it

   well go to the other side and count
 every third one thats it

   id probably find it while i was get-
 ting there i want to get down for
 heavens sake man help me down
 the editor was well nigh frantic by this
 time  arrest me for murder swipin
 iuice suicide everything and anything-
 but get me rfouii 

  the limb of the law removed his hel-
 met and scratched his head meditatively
 for a moment  ill call out th reserves
 when i get back t th station-house he
 finally called up

   whats the use of waiting

   oh i aint afraid yu cant get
 away

   fool  weldon hissed

  the cop grinned amiably back at him
 as he buttoned his coat preparatory to
 taking his departure

   yu cant get away he called chcer
 easiest thing in the world



 ily and swinging his willow strolled
 amiably across the sidewalk to where a
 little frame saloon stood

  the editors fingers twitched with a
convulsive desire to twine them about the
fellows bull ncck in potent silcncc he
watched the doors swing to behind the
stalwart figure then burst into a fit of
language that shook the riven air and
enveloped him in a purple haze the
very idea of-

   hallo mister 

  weldon leaned over and glanced down
in surprise that any one should notice
his predicament without first making
him rasp his throat ten different ways to
attract attention was something he had
begun to think out of the range of hu-
man possibility

  a small dirty-faced boy stood there
looking up at him with big round won-
dering eyes

  halloi the editor responded dole-
fully

  this child could do nothing to help
him

   gee  the boy gasped  howd
yu get up jtherc 

    was shunted in here

  for a moment the boy said nothing
then his whole being exploded iu one
envious sentence

   say it must le great t be grown up
 couldnt never get up there

   i hope not the editor responded
grimly

   did yu climb th pillar or was yu
heatin yure fare the infant con-
tinued

   it was a mistake

   if i climb up half-way will yu haul
me over th railin he queried eagerly

   no i wont dont you dare come
up here weldon scowlcd angrily
down to deter the child who was already
shinning rapidly up the square pole

  stingyi the hoy dropped to the
ground and glared at the enemy above
him

   sonny -it took long thought to
bring the idea- ill give you a quarter
if youll get somebody to help me down
from here

   les ce th quarter first greedily

  the editor produced the necessary coin
from his pocket and held it alluringly
in the glare of a neighboring arc light

   yull take it back when yu get
down argumentatively

   ill give it to you now weldon
sent the coin spinning to the ground and
the child pounced on it ravenously

   ill call th cop he shouted glee-
fully preparing to run toward the sa-
loon

  no no no it is impossible to
put on paper the sliding scale of horror
at the idea  tell your father

  hell take away the quarter

   dont tell him youve got a quarter
so shameless had this predicament made
him that weldon was ready by now to
teach little children the lesson of de-
ceit

   how muchll yu give him for get-
tin yu down it was awful-this
childs openly avaricious nature

   ten dollars weldon responded
haphazard

  there was a flutter of dust where the
boy had been the editor breathed a
great sigh of relief he was ccrtain
tbat at least an effort would be made
toward his liberation now

  breathlessly he waited presently
not one but two men came dashing to
the scene in the wake of tliq speeding
urchin

   here he is shouted the boy glee-
fully here he is

  the editor gazed with pleasurable
twinges of joy at the great broad-shoul-
dered chap who came racing around the
corner

   show me your ten  the foremost
breathlessly panted

  his chest was rising and falling with
his unaccustomed exertions

   ill do it fer five mister the man
who brought up the rear held up two
fingers of his hand as he made the bid

  the father turned angrily and said
something indistinguishable to his rival
only the boy appreciated the full mean-
ing of the disaster about to overtake his
house lie shrilled to the one in the
air  lkv you promised mv ole man
th job 

  the editor pondered the question for
a second instinct said  save your
five  conscience said  hold to your
bargain but then entered the fact that
the man had forfeited his claim to any
control over his conscience by demand-


the argosy

ing money for assisting  man in a dire
predicament

  the length of time taken to bring the
still small voice of conscience to the
fore over the demon avarice in the shape
of five dollars while short was sufficient
tor many things to occur not down in
the books

  the retorts between the two men had
become hotter and hotter until they were
shouting at the top of their voices their
faces were red and hot and angry and
they shook their fists at each other the
while they busied themselves in calling
upon the hidden stores of cursing se-
creted about their persons a crowd
had begun to collect and its members
were already taking sides in the argu-
ment

  i do a job for ten dollars and he
offers t do it fer five the father of the
urchin urged

  who got the job a large judi-
cial appearing man swept through the
throng which opened before him with a
respect that augured considerable stand-
ing in the community

   i did the urchin stepped forward
and scratched his bare toe around in a
circle  th feller asked me t give it
t me old man

   then its a scab job youre trying t
  et and the arbiter turned to the uti-
  cr-biddcr

   who says im a scab the fellow
looked threateningly round the circle of
faces  th jobs only worth five dol-
lars its overchargin the old man was
tryin t do

  whats th job the peacemaker
turned again to the child who pointed
silently toward the mail on the siding
above them

  all eyes turned curiously toward him
and the editor felt a strange stage fright
creeping over him

   whats th job yu want done dc
manded the arbiter

    want to get taken down to the
ground

  i-ong time the important man scratched
ills head while the crowd critically took
stock of the situation and ventured wide-
ly divergent opinions

    think its worth th ten the inter-
ccdor finally concluded  its a scab
job at five

   ive been in th union since it was
organized an this is th first time ive
ever been railed a scab protested the
low-priced laborer

  scab i scab i hissed the crowd

  the taunt seemed to drive the fellow
frantic for he turned and landed wild-
ly-at the same time effectively-upon
the head of his opposing bidder in a
moment there was a mad scramble of
arms and legs and feet and fists

  the tumult was at its height when the
officer with whom the editor had dis-
puted came rushing from the saloon
and soon with the assistance of his club
had tilings adjusted to a state of perfect
quiet lie listened for a few moments
to the eager explanations from all sides
then brushed the crowd away with a lord-
ly wave of his club

  startin a riot are ye now he in-
quired indignantly of the man hanging
oil the rail above  ill call the reserves
this time an take vu along wid inc

  he ftrode angrily toward the opposite
side of the street and marched briskly
around the corner after all even
though he would be arrested the editor
felt that anything would be pleasurable
after his present experience surely his
evening dress and appearance and man-
ner would be enough to persuade any
sensible man that he was not trying to
steal electricity or any of the other
idiotic things of which the dunderhended
policeman had accused him more-
over-

   well well well  a merry gentle-
man in evening dress topped and stared
aghast at the spectacle weldon present-
ed waving frantically to him from the
railing of the siding

  come over here called the editor

  this man was a gentleman or at any
rate was dressed like one and would
certainly have sense enough to follow any
instructions given him

  the man sauntered leisurely under the
tracks

   im a gentleman the victim first
informed him

  good so am  but what in the
dickens are you doing up there  

   they shunted me  a siding and
left me here for the night i missed my
station-the last one down the road

  cant you get down
easiest thing

in the world



  no

  can i assist you 

  yes

  how

  i dont know

 both thought long and earnestly tt
 was a problem that might well have taxed
 the brains of any one but a piano-niovcr

  ill come up the man suited the
 action to the word by clasping the ele-
 vated pillar and to the great detriment
 of his apparel-rising a few feet

  what good is your getting up going
 to do you or me the editor snarled
 impatiently

  i never thought of that the man
 looked foolish for a moment until an-
 other idea struck him

  ill get a ladder

  where could you get a ladder that
 would reach up here

  ill go to a paint shop they painted
 the outside of my place and it was higher
 than this

 the man was a bit irritated at the
 manner in which his suggestion had been
 received

  paint shops are all closed the edi-
 tor objected  and besides i dont
 want to have anything more to do with
 labor theyll bo boycotted for work-
 ing after union hours

   dont see what wc can do then
 the would-be rescuer said with a doleful
 sigh

  could yon call out the hook and lad-
 der company of the lire department 

 a great burst of inspiration had swept
 over the editor

  they wont send out just one and
 besides they would-

 the mans face lit up and he slapped
 one hand with a mighty whack into the
 other an an idea struck him  ill put
 in an alarm when they come around
 you yell

  but the editor objected  what
 will they say 

  ill run after i put in the alarm

  but wont they arrest me

 what for the man cricd in sur-
 prise  you havent turned in any
 alarm

  all right weldon assented gloom-
 ily   anythings belter than being up
 here go ahead

 the man wns starting toward the fire-

   	a

box on the corner when he stopped
struck with a sudden thought

   comc over to my house when you get
down he suggested  how long have
you been up there 

   what time is it 

   half-past eight

   about an hour and three-quarters

   well you must be pretty hungry
come over and have a bite with me

   i have a dinner engagement at eight
in the next block or so but ill drop in
and thank you some time soon where
do you live

   no ft becker placc

  wheres that how do you gel
there

   easiest thing in the world you-

  the editor smiled it was always the
same with these brooklynites every
location was the easiest in the world

  he listened in a haze to the elaborate
directions and lied glibly about coming
over in a day or so to pay a short visit to
his benefactor

   a note would servo amply he re-
flected he was never coming to brook-
lyn again

  there was a slight noise from across
the street he started nervously for the
man had broken the glass of the fire-box
and had turned in the alarm

  the editor watched his retreating coat-
tails as they merged hastily into the night
and sighed a great and weary sigh

  for a moment he waited straining his
eyes through the darkness and listening
with all his ears the period of sus
pensr was short far down the street
lie saw a small speck then heard a
mighty clanging of the gong faster
and faster it camc until by the time he
made out its outlines distinctly it seemed
a menacing demon of black smoke nickel
polishings straining horses and flying
sparks

  this was a terrible thing to rescue a
man with almost the editor would
rather have remained where he was all
night however there was no alterna-
tive now so he raised his voice and yelled
at the top of his lungs

  the men had jumped from the rear
of the engine and were rapidly atraching
the hose to the fire-plug on the corner

  clang clang clang from the same
direction whirled a great long hook-and


iiie argosy

ladder wagon the men-about ten of
them-sprang from their stands and
grouped anxiously about the foreman
who was peering in every direction to
make out any signs of fire in the neigh-
borhood

  the editor raised his voice still higher
and fairly howled to them

  the foreman glanced up at the deso-
late figure on the  i  siding and sharp-
ly commanded the men to plant the lad-
der against it in a trice he was clam-
bering up the thing two steps at a time
ax in hand

  follow me boys he called out
small need for the command the en-
tire lot save two left at the watcr-plug
were already at his heels weldon felt
strangely elated at the furor his presence
had created

  the foreman vaulted lightly over the
railing and faced him men tumbled
over helter-skelter and grouped about

   where is -it   gasped the captain of
the engine company

   what serenely inquired the editor
bis innocent manner strangely belying the
thumping heart that was agitating his
bulging white-bosomed shirt

  the lire quick man

   what fire 

   who called us out

  the tone was sharp crisp and com-
manding

   i didnt i couldnt get down
maybe somebody saw me and put in an
alarm weldon suggested

  an alarm i for you never had
the editor felt so unutterably small as
under the foremans withering gaze
how did you get here

  the car passed my station and left
me here

   and you are the alarm 

  the disgust in the others voice was
absolutely indescribable

   yes sir abject his manner ab-
ject his inner self

   what for

   i wanted to get down to go -to
dinner

  the foreman looked him over from
head to foot

   well youre the first man that ever
used the fire department of now york
for a valet he slowly remarked

   i dont understand  

   you want to get to dinner you say
well wouldnt you like me to call up
the chief and have him send his auto-
mobile around and take you where you
want to go

  the editor was silent even under this
injustice

   do you know what it costs the city
every time wc roll the man dropped
his bantering tone and spoke sharply

   livery time you do what

   wc roll every time wc go out on
a fire call

   no sir

   well fifty dollars for tires alone

   thats very expensive weldon ven-
tured

  he could think of nothing better to
say though he recognized the idiocy of
the remark the instant it had escaped his
lips

   well what are you going to do
about it  

   whatever you say he humbly
agreed fifty dollars seemed a lot of
money for a roll  but  didnt put
in the alarm the editor added

   well and the man looked him over
again  you give me your name and
address and ill put it down in my re-
port-book i have to account for every
roll wc make will you promise to make
good for the price if the fire commis-
sioner thinks its up to you

   yes weldon was ready to do any-
thing to get out of this second mess
slowly he drew from his pocket a card
and penciled his business address on it
the foreman silently took it and mo-
tioned him down the ladder

  weldon drew a breath of relief as at
last he set his feet upon the pavement
he had never duly appreciated it lefore
-this sensation of unutterable joy the
asphalt gave him

  tlie foreman smiled at the expression
on his face good-by alarm and
he held out his hand pleasantly

   do you know anything about brook-
lyn timidly ventured the editor

  the man nodded  lived here all
my life

   well can you tell me where- he
took from his pocket the small piece of
paper on which he had jotted down the
directions from the phone a year ago-or
was it really only two hours tan
easiest thing in the worm



you tell me where i can get to the greene
street station of the elevated and walk
two blocks ahead turn to my left and
get to the second house on the northeast
corner 

   easiest thing in the world i  the
foreman responded  you just- why
whats the matter 

  the fare of the editor had gone purple
with rage

   please he begged  please i ask
you not to say that  easiest thing in the
world  again thais what you all ay
just tell me where i can find the place
and dont comment

  the foreman looked at him in sur-
prise

   -til right he finally assented with a
laugh  walk three blocks down that
way and he pointed  then turn to
your right walk five blocks cast
and-

   do you know whether there might
ik- a cab around here the editor sadly
interrupted

   around the left-hand corner you will
find one

  there was a clang clang of prepara-
tion and the engine together with the
hook and ladder wert off with a wave
of his hand the foreman swept out of
sight and the editor walked off slowly in
search of a cab

  ten minutes later he was wearily as-
cending the sommerss steps a maid
answered the bell and ushered him into
the reception-room where he found a
hostess whose indignation was speedily
dissipated hv a glance at the wan white
face of her tardy guest

   it makes no difference whatever she
reassured him  i want you to meet
miss wilson and tell her what to do
regarding her career

  the editor smiled faintly at the word
 career all amateurs used it when
they asked his advice regarding their fu-
ture

   she tells me she has already sent you
a story his hostess went on  perhaps
you may have read it

  she stepped to the folding doors and
pushing aside the portifcrcs called to
some one within

   george will you come here a mo-
ment i want you to meet mr wel-
don

  a vision in white showed for an instant
against the dull blue of the curtains

   mr weldon this is the young lady
frank was speaking to you about over
the telephone miss george wilson

  weldon scarcely knew how he got
through the introduction she was cer-
tainly a dream of loveliness and this
was the author of the talc that had
caused all his troubles he recalled
now that he once knew another woman
whose name was george

   what was the name of the story you
submitted to mr weldon continued

mrs sommers

    the pursuit   the editor burst
forth producing the manuscript from his
pocket  that was what i was read-
ing when-

   youve read it then   the girl
stepped eagerly forward  would you
advise me to stay and write or go back
home 

   i would stay he quietly answered
 miss wilson your story was so clever
that it even fooled me it was all so
vivid

   and you will help her mrs som-
mers eagerly suggested

    shall be delighted weldons ac-
quiesccnce was so emphatic it brought an
involuntary smile to the lips of the
hostess she was very fond of them
both

   then you will say with me george
mrs sommers said with decision

   i think it would be easier for miss
wilson to get around to the offices with
her manuscripts if she lived in new
york the editor timidly suggested

   easy to get around  the brooklyn-
itc bridled  frank i  she called her
husband john advises george to live
in new york says it is so easy to get
around there what do you think of
the difficulty of going there from our
house 

   easiest thing in the world  he blus-
tered  why-

   i have no doubt the editor sadly
acquiesced

   and you really think i will make a
success asked miss wilson

   easiest thing in the world i  an-
swered the editor looking down at her

  then they all went in ro h somewhat
delayed dinner

chapter xi

a close cam

seizing his opportunity and with
the agility ef a trained acrobat the
man suddenly sprang back a pace and
raising his foot by a well-directed kick
sent the weapon spinning toward the
coiling out of campbells hand the
net instant he hurled himself upon the
astonished scotchman

  the violence of the unexpected attack
sent campbell to the floor with a crash
which shook the room he felt the pow-
erful grasp of the other upon his throat
and stunned for the moment could offer
no resistance

  pinning his enemy down the man
looked about for the knife he had dropped
a few moments before the expression
upon his face showed he would not hesi-
tate to drive home the blade if he
succeeded in regaining possession of it
but fortunately the knife lay just beyond
his reach and to recover it he must loosen
his hold upon his captives throat

  campbell struggled desperately for he
  htgan augmt ancony

realized that in a few moments he must
be choked into insensibility seizing
with both hands the wrist of his antag-
onist he sought to break his hold but
the brutal strength of the man was well
fitted for such a contest the ceiling
the walls of the room the leering face
above him began to swim in a dizzy
haze the tension of his muscles relaxed
and his finger numb and powerless
released their clutch upon the others
wrist

  then gradually consciousness returned
for the pressure upon his windpipe had
relaxed everything still swam dizzily
and his body seemed to be held down by a
leaden weight but his lungs were no
longer bursting from the death grip upon
his throat

  for the second occasion jean labrie
had interposed in the tiick of tune

  during the first moments of the un-
expected attack the butler had remained
as one paralyzed the curtain-cords hang-
ing limply in his hand then as
campbell ceased his struggles courage
returned to him

  with a sharp indrawing of hi breath
he sprang forward and dropped the loop
of the cord over the assailants shoulders
by a sudden twist the silken rope tight
cncd about the mans bull-like throat and
fabric scarcely knowing what he did
twisted and pulled with the frenzied
strength of desperation

  for a moment the fellow sought to free
his neck by seizing the cord with one
hand but even his strength augmented
by passion was unequal to the task
with a growl of rage he let go camp-
bells throat and tried to insert his fingers
between his own and the tightening noose

  at that moment had labrie weakened
all must have been lost for did the other
succeed in loosening the cord he could
have crushed the butler by a single blow
half-choked dragged back by the tension
of the rope his great strength might still
have gained the victory had not iabrie
resorted to a last desperate measure

  feeling the cord slipping between his
fingers he threw himself backward upon
the floor bracing his feet against camp-
bells extended legs the sudden jerk
which followed this maneuver threw the
other off his balance endeavoring to save

himself he let go the rope which tight
cncd with a horrible pressure and it
was at this moment campbell returned
to consciousness

  for several moments he lay still
realizing only that a struggle wax taking
place near him and that a strangling
choking noise filled the room then
with an effort he half rose and brushed
his hand across his eyes

  the purple face of his late antagonist
and the hands beating the air iinpotently
met his gaze  then it traveled farther to
the figure of iabrie prone upon the floor
and tugging at the cord with all his
strength

  for a moment he remained benumbed
and spellbound his eyes riveted upon this
novel combat

  the body of the rhoking man heaved
convulsively and he threw out one hand
wildly as he did so his fingers came
in rontart with the hilt of the knife lying
on the carpet

  campbell was unable to move as
through a haze he saw the hand tighten
upon the weapon with a last supreme
effort the victim summoned all his de-

parting strength and struggled to his
knees dragging labrie along the floor
and nearer to him

  unable to see his breast bursting the
fellow raised the knife and struck blindly
downward but the effort had comc too
late the tension of the cord grew
lighter the blade of the knife buried it-
self in the carpet and the man rolled over
upon his face

  campbell staggered to his feet and the
butler weak and panting rose also for
a moment the two remained motionless
gazing at the silent figure upon the floor
the cort still tightly twisted about his
nerk then campbell took the rope
from iabries hand and untwisted it rap

idly

  it required but a superficial examina-
tion to determine that relief had comc
too late the man who had been brought
to the hotel dc marrast as the jailer of
the old nobleman was dead

  campbell turned to jean labrie
whose hands were trembling and whose
face was the color of chalk

   it is but retribution my friend for
lie would have killed us as i fear he has
already killed the comte de plauex
come  said he in a grave voicc

  he passed on into the room beyond
which he found was a large apartment
having at one end an alcove partitioned
off by heavy curtains the place was
dimly lighted and going to the window
he pushed back the inner wooden shut
tcrs

  as he suspected the entrance to the
house lay directly ikmieath him and it was
from this window the count had dropped
the note

  labrie standing  the threshold be-
tween the two rooms watched him in mule
silence but at intervals he turned and
looked at the dead man lying  the
carpet in the anteroom campbell crossed
the floor and parted the curtains guarding
the alcove

  on a bed within lay the form of the
old french nobleman at first campbell
believed that death had visited this placc
also but on leaning over the pillow he
saw that the count was breathing faintly
-the labored respiration of one who has
sunk into sudden and complete uncon-
sciousness

  a hurried examination revealed the


the argosy

cause of this deathlike stupor the
upper garments of the old man bore evi-
dence of violence the old-fashioned
stock was torn and twisted the white
ruffles of the shirt below rent and crum-
pled apparently a relentless hand had
seized the unhappy du plauex dragged
him across the room and hurled him with
savage force upon the bed

  campbell did not need to be told the
reason of this outrage upon the person
of ft feeble old man the jailer had dis-
covered his charge in the act of dropping
the paper from the window and had
used his brutal strength unsparingly

  that swift retribution hnd visited the
fellow afforded no great satisfaction  the
old nobleman might be dying and the
secret he desired to reveal was locked
behind the tightly closed ups camp
bell did not doubt for a moment that in
some manner the count had discovered
the identity of the marquiss enemy and
because of this discovery had been im-
prisoned in charge of the ruffian who had
received orders to permit no one to com-
municate with him

  he turned quickly to labrie

   a physician-haste is imperative-i
fear the comte de plauex is dying 

  the butler aroused by the commanding
tone turned toward the anteroom

   monsieur  he stammered

  hasten cried campbell and bent
again over the silent form on the bed

  labrie vanished into the corridor

  campbell lifted the unconscious man
in his arms propping him higher up on
the pillows then he looked about for
water

  seizing a carafe from a stand on the
farther side of the room he hastened back
to the bed and bent once more over the
count as he did so the clank of spurred
feet sounded in the corridor turning
sharply he saw a man hurriedly cross the
threshold of the anteroom casting a
quick glance at the body on the floor the
newcomer advanced to the door of the
counts apartment

lost in the blackness

  it did not require keen perception on
campbells part to guess the identity of

the man who had so unexpectedly ap-
pea ml labrie hnd told him de lesse
was an ollicer in the service of the king
and the newcomer wore the gold-and-blue
uniform of a royal guardsman

   he noted that he was a clean-cut fellow
of about his own age with a handsome
high-bred face easy carriage and a
manner denoting a will which he knew
how to use when occasion demanded
now the square jaw was set in stern lines
and the steel-blue eyes were darkened by
a frown as he glanced from campbell to
the form propped up on the pillows

   for a moment lie remained motionless
one hand resting lightly on his sword-
hilt  then the frown upon his face rew
darker

   monsieur said lie in n cold voice
 it would appear that i have arrived at
an inopportune moment it would seem
the comte de plauex has already received
a visitor

   the cutting coolness of the tone stirred
camplwhs anger believing what he did
of the man before him

  if you cxpcctcd to find this room
occupied only by a helpless old man and
a hired ruffian your coming is indeed
inopportune monsieur le vicomte  he an-
swered dryly

  the other permitted an unpleasant
smile to cross his face

    ah  said he coldly  so it appears
you know me monsieur and i in turn
have heard something of an englishman
who has seen fit to interfere in the
affairs of the marquis de marrast hut
i did not suspect that such interference
would lead to the murder of an old man
and-his body-guard

  for a moment campbell remained
silent in a flash it came to him that the
other proposed to use the situation to his
own advantage he no longer doubted
that the vicomte de iesse was numbered
among the enemies of the marquis that
he was the wolf who had entered the
hotel tie marrast

    monsieur  said he steadily  you do
not for a moment believe that the comte
dc plauex received violence at my hands
as to the other- a mnn defends his life
from the kntfe of an assassin

   the vicotie shrugged his shoulders

   it is only permitted me to know what
 have seen i enter the house to find a
secret enemies



dead man lying upon the lloor another
my friend the count i either dead or
dying  find you a stranger iu tlie act
of strangling him can you explain that
mmsieurt 

  campbell realized he was caught iu a
pretty trap for the expression upon the
others face showed he was perfectly
satisfied with the situation everything
depended upon inbric who alone had
witnessed what had really occurred  but
would labrie be permitted to tell what
he knew would the word of a butler
prevail against the power which had sent
a french nobleman to the bastile

  the vicomtc was watching his face
closely suddenly he burst into an un-
pleasant laugh

  ah monsieur he said dryly you
are wondering why you ventured to play
with fire it is only a fool who does not
guard his own safety come let u under-
stand each other i do not deny you are
a brave man but bravery does not always
go with w isdom and perhaps i can teach
you something of the lattei it is true
your friend the marquis has requested
a trifling service but a man is not ex-
pected to throw away life and liberty
recklessly besides another thing must
be taken into consideration  can assure
you that mile dc marrast has nothing
to fear i have constituted myself her
protector

  he flecked a spot of dust from the gold
embroidery of his uniform

   come my friend he continued
 let us deal no longer with surmise but
accept the true condition of the matter
you have been misinformed as to what
i have to do with this affair i desire to
make mademoiselle my wife  but for some
reason the marquis had other plans in
view those plaits are doubtless known
to you monsieur in fact in summoning
you to paris de marrast was only carry-
ing out his idea to unite his sister to a
foreignrr -yourself m campbell

  he paused  then as campbell did not
reply went on

  there you have the situation in a
nntshell  desire mademoiselle for my-
self but i meet the opposition of her
brother whom she is bound to obey and
what follows why he marrast finds
himself in the bastile and the lady is
left to do her own choosing a man

must protect his own interests and that
is what i have done monsieur

  on the day upon which mademoi-
selle becomes my wife her brother will
obtain his liberty what more can be de-
sired probably i shall be challenged
to fight de marrast but of course that is
none of your affair against you i have
no personal animosity provided you
cease to interfere in what does not con-
cern you return to fngland satisfied
that your services are no longer required
in this business

   and if i should think otherwise 
that my duty to dc marrast is not fuu
filled asked campbell

  the rieomte shrugged his shoulders

   several things might happen i
might kill you now and it would be be
lieved i acted in defense of the count
or  might turn you over to the policc
charged with being a garrotcr we know
how to deal with such in france my
friend

  and the alternative responded
campbell calmly though he desired to
seize the other by the throat

   as i have already stated you will
be permitted to leave this house unmo-
lested provided you swear to depart from
france within twenty-four hours and in-
terfere no more in this affair you see i
am inclined to be generous choose
monsieur iu either case your service is at
an end

  for several moments campbell did not
speak he was debating if he was longer
justified in pursuing the coursc he had
undertaken it certainly appeared that
no great harm could comc tu mademoi-
selle and if the vicomte spoke the truth
the marquis would speedily be liberated

  then the thought of retiring from the
field in the face of a threat restrained
him

  monsieur said he the fact yet re
mains that the marquis dc marrast has
not withdrawn his appeal an appeal
made in the hour of his extremity be-
cause  am threatened with danger does
not lessen my obligation in the matter
you arc a soldier and appreciate the
situation

   perfectly monsieurreplied the
other dryly  as you also appreciate
that your zeal ha been misdirected you
can imagine the marquiss feelings when


the argosy

he discovered he could no longer be in
the position to oppose objection to my
suit for his sisters hand your arrival
was hourly expected  through your inter-
ference my plans might be frustrated
dc marrast seized the opportunity rely-
ing upon your chivalry toward a friend
in need he has -shall wc say it is the
story of the cat and the monkey it is
you monsieur who is engaged in pulling
the marquiss chestnuts from the fire
hut i am accustomed to meeting difficul-
ties and - overcoming them it would
appear that i have done so in this case
and-to my satisfaction

  lie glanced toward the inanimate form
of the old nobleman

   unfortunately the comte de plauex
was pleased to mix himself in this affair 
that he has suffered the consequences is
no ones fault except his own it re-
mains for you monsieur to take warn
ing that i am not to he trilled with this
matter must lie between dc marrast nnd
me i shall know how to meet such condi-
tions as arise

   and you mean to say that you have
permitted the count to lc assaulted you
do not stop even at assassination to gain
your ends demanded campbell with
rising anger

  the ricomtc smiled

   you have forgotten that it is you who
stand accused of having assaulted the
comte de plauex i have nothing to do
with it he replied coldly

   and while we stand talking he may
be dying

   so much the worse for you if you do
not adopt the course of wisdom in this
matter answered dc iessc

  he look out his watch and glanced at
the dial carelessly

    think you understand the situation
and to discuss it further will be a waste
of words monsieur i shall permit you a
quarter of an hour in which to dccidc
upon an answer at the end of that time
 will return possibly with a physician-
at any rate with those who will obey what
i order them to do you may even re-
tire with some honor for under certain
circumstances i shall make it appear that
it is you who killed that fellow in the
anteroom in defense of de plauex on
tjie other hand-

  he returned the watch to its fob and

the unpleasant smile played about his
lips

   on the other baud monsieur i shall
feel it my duty to turn you over to the
police on the charge of having murdered
the count and his body-scrvant it is to
be england or the conciergeric

  campbell felt himself powerless the
frenchman was on his guard and it
would be useless to resort to violence
he also understood perfectly that no
opportunity woald be given him to escape
from the room during the others brief
absence

  there was indeed the window but a
drop of thirty feet into a crowded
boulevard would be madness

  de iessc backed across the threshold
into the anteroom reached the outer door
and stepped into the corridor as he did
so he removed the key and inserted it in
the lock on the outside

   a quarter of an hour monsieur  said
he significantly and closing the door
turned the key

  for a little time campbell remained
standing motionless beside the bed

  whether or no the man whose cun-
ning had outwitted him had told the
whole truth and mile de marrast really
stood in no danger mattered little he
must perforce accept his conditions and
promise to leave france or becornc a pris-
oner charged with the murder of a french
nobleman

  suddenly he started and turned sharp
ly toward the bed for a faint tremulous
voice broke in upon his thoughts with
an exclamation lie bent down and looked
into the face of the old count the dying
had returned to life-de plauexs eyes
were open and in them the light of rec-
ognition

  forgetting for the moment his own af-
fairs campbell seized the carafe and
pouring a quantity of the water into his
palm began to bathe the old mans fore-
head it was evident the count had re-
turned to full consciousness  the sturdy
spirit which had resisted thirty years of
confinement in a dungeon had not yielded
to the brutal assault of an enraged jailer

  he made a feeble motion that the
water bottle lc held to his lips and when
he had swallowed a portion of the fluid
a new lease of life conquered the leth-
argy
secret enemies



  monsieur he murmured arc you
listening monsieur 

  campbell fell upon his knees beside
the bed the old nobleman closed hls
eyes for a moment and it seemed a
though he would again relapse into un-
consciousness but with an effort he
aroused his lagging energies

  it was the vicomte he asked in a
voicc from which all tremor had departed
then before campbell could reply he
continued feebly

   i have heard much which passed be-
tween you monsieur and in part that man
has told the truth yet you must put no
trust in him it is true he desires to
marry mademoiselle but do not think he
will obtain the marquiss freedom of a
lesser branch of the de marrasts he
covets the title and estates with de
marrast in the hostile and mademoiselle
his wife he may obtain his desire it is
he who sent the marquis to a dungeon
and do you fancy he will be the one to
give him freedom already he has
taken steps to assume his place in france
for mademoiselle he cares nothing save
that in marrying her she becomes his
slave

  the voicc trailed off into a low mur-
mur  a tremor passed through the old
mans body and for a moment it seemed
the spirit had departed then by a last
supreme effort the count summoned back
the flickering spark

  with that supernatural strength which
is sometimes given to the dying he raised
himself clear of the pillows

   monsieurhe whispered in a firm
voicc  it yet remains to you to save the
marquis

 and how cried campbell in
gods name tell me how monsieur-for
i am powerless 

 slowly the old nobleman raised
his arm and his hand no longer trem-
bling pointed to the wall on the opposite
side of the room

   the third panel from the corner-
press the fluted moldfhg monsieur-the
third panel from the corner  

  the last words were barely distinguish-
able for a moment the outstretched arm
remained rigid then the body of the count
collapsed and the head fell back upon the
pillows a final gasp issued from between
the parted lip-then silence

  campbells hand was trembling as he
replaced the carafe upon the table he
had lost all count of time and even that
moment might mark the passing of the
final minute of that fateful quarter of an
hour the dead no longer required his
services it remained for him to serve the
living

  almost in a daze he crossed the room
and stopped before the paneled wains-
coting counting from the corner he
passed his fingers along the carved wood-
work of the third panel pressing firmly

  he had reached a point near the base-
board when in answer to his touch a
faint click rewarded his efforts under
his hand the panel slid back slowly re
vealing an opening sufficiently large to
permit the passage of a human body

  the interior of this aperture was hid-
den in darkness but campbell did not
hesitate casting one final look at the
still form on thu lied lie stepped into the
opening and turning closed the panel
behind him the snap of the powerful
spring showed that his method of exit
was no longer visible to nny one who
might enter the room beyond

  hy feeling with feet and hands he
discovered he was in a narrow passage
scarcely three feet wide and only high
enough to permit walking upright
where this passage might lead he did not
stop to consider it was sufficient that it
afforded escape from the vicomte de
iesse and those who would accompany
him when he returned

  with the greatest caution feeling on
either side and before him campbell
plunged forward in the darkness for
a score of feet the passage continued on
a level then the foot he advanced met
only space he dropped upon his hands
and knees and groped in the blackness
his efforts were rewarded by discovering
that lie had reached the top of a flight
of steps

  he descended carefully counting as
he did so at the bottom of the thirtieth
step he came again to a level and judged
the passage now ran parallel with the
first floor of the house for the first
time he stopped and wiped the perspira-
tion from his face the atmosphere
through which he had been moving was
filled with a sticky dampness

  once more lie began to follow the


the argosy

passage and presently readied a second
flight of steps but these numbered
scarcely a dozen and at the bottom he
found the stone pavement slippery with
moisture then suddenly his out-
stretched hands cnme in contact with a
hard metallic substance

  it was on iron door completely block-
ing the way

  for the first time he began to doubt
the wisdom of groping through an un-
known labyrinth then the thought of
what lay behind bolstered up his cour-
age  he judged also that de plauex
would not have directed him into a trap
and there must be some means of escape
from the passage even to one not famil-
iar with his surroundings

  with infinite patience he began to
examine every inch of the door at
first no bolt or spring rewarded his ef-
forts but at length reaching upward
he touched n little way above his head
the end of a rusty chain

  thricc he pulled upon it only to
waste his strength and bruise his hands
but at length having exerted all his
muscle a bolt holding the top of the
door to the ceiling gave way to push
the iron barrier outward now became
easy and as it yielded a gust of cold
damp air struck his face

  beyond lay impenetrable blackness
and he realized that the wny before him
was no longer a narrow passage leading
between stone walls reaching out and
upward his hands encountered only
space he believed himself to be in a
great underground vault the extent of
which it was beyond bis power to guess

  step by step he crept forward and the
black void had no ending he legan to
fancy he had missed the way that the
original passage branched off nt right
angles with the one he had been follow-
ing since descending the second flight of
steps and that he was now only plung-
ing deeper and deeper into the bowel
of the earth to be buried finally in a
living tomb

  could he have touched anything with
his hands it would have given him con-
fidence  hut on every side except where
his feet trod was only seemingly endless
space finally he stopped and a feel
ing of fear crept over him

  then suddenly as though by in-

stinct a thought came to him he re-
membered what he had read about the
wonderful underground world of pnris
that immense labyrinth of vaults and
passages a series of hidden streets be-
neath the pavements of the city

  the solution now seemed clear the
passage from the htel de marrast
ended at the iron door beyond lay the
mysterious sewers and catacombs of
paris

  for the moment a fresh fear seized
him once lost in the mazes of these
sewers he might wander for days and
finally perish only by a supreme ex
ertion of will power did he refrain from
turning about and rushing blindly back
through the darkness

  he remembered now how simple it
would have been to remain concealed in
the passage behind the walls of the
house until night when escape through
the counts apartment might have been
possible

  then suddenly a feeling of utter
recklessness replaced the moments of
panic men had found themselves in
the underground world of paris and
unaided had reached the open air
surely there was an end somewhere and
to reach it was not impossible

  setting his teeth firmly together
campbell again moved forward with the
dogged determination of otie who has
burned his bridges behind him

  itow long he continued the weary
tramp it was impossible to determine
but suddenly when he least expected
relief a gleam of light appeared in the
distance

  fearing it might vanish as quickly as
it had shone forth he began to run
once lie stumbled and fell headlong but
scrambled to his feet unmindful of
bruises

  gradually the light drew nearer and
he could see that it came from the flick-
ering rays of a lantern  the person who
carried it was moving toward him

  panting campbell slackened his pace
and the light approached more slowly
then the dim outlines of the man who
carried it became visible

  campbell uttered a hoarse cry and
rushed forward the lantern-bearer
stopped suddenly backed away from the
center of the passage and raised the
secret kn em s

g

light above bis head at the same in-
stant lie drew a glittering object from
beneath his coat

  halting a dozen yards away camp-
bell stared at tlie fellow iu astonishment
the rays of the lantern revealed its
bearers face plainly

  it was the under butler jacques who
a few hour before he had seen a prisoner
in the hands of the guard at tlie gate
of the tuileries

oncc ok tiik kinos guard

  it seemed as though the man with
the light hesitated whether to spring
forward and use the knife he held in his
right hand or to dash the lantern to the
floor and plunge the passage in dark-
ness it was plain he wavered be-
tween astonishment and fear undecided
whether lo fight or to retreat

  as for campbell for the moment sur-
prise held him dumb then he realized
that unless lie made the first move the
other would be of no service to him
already the man had apparently rcachcd
a decision for he was crouching lor a
spring

   monsieur said lie in as calm a
voice as he could muster   was think-
ing i would not begrudge a hundred
francs to be guided from this place 
am now inclined to offer double that
amount vou appear to be in a hurry to
plunge deeper into the bowels of the
earth i in turn am as anxious to sec
daylight once more

  for another moment the frenchman
retained his threatening attitude then it
dawned upon him that not only did he
stand in no danger but that the other
was even appealing for assistance iiis
grip upon the handle of the knife did not
relax but he straightened himself and
advanced the lantern a little

  for ihe first time the light revealed
campbell plainly

   mori du tliable it is the english-
man   he cried in astonishment

   so it would seem my friend replied
campbell dryly comc i will not
pretend not to know who you are for we
met two nights ago in the corridor of the
iiatel de marrast  and it is also apparent

you have recognized me as the person to
whom the comte de plauex delivered a
letter entrusted to him by the marquis
de marrast why you arc hero i will
not inquire but i desire to ask you a
question where am   

  m jacques stared into bis face for a
moment then a grin which overspread
his bruised and battered countenance
took the place of his expression of amaze-
ment

   mille tonncrrts and so you do not
know where you are monsieur surely
you did not fancy you were taking a walk
upon the boulevard

  he chuckled at the joke he fancied he
had perpetrated

  hut campbell was in no mood to per-
mit the conversation to drift into humor-
ous channels he understood that in
some manner the man hod cscapcd from
his raptors and- was returning to the
hotel de marrast by the underground
route in order to avoid being recognizcd
on the street and again taken into cus-
tody lie answered gravely

  it is true i do not know where i am
but doubtless you can enlighten me and
i am willing to pay you well for your
trouble although i have reason to be-
lieve you have been my enemy i think it
is possible for us to understand each
other

   and how do you know  have been
your enemy monsieur  demanded the
man suspiciously

   well it was not difficult to discover
that especially since my return to the
hdtel de marrast which i have just left
in order to avoid the police who arc
anxious to arrest some one replied
campbell

  as he hoped this declaration had the
desired effect his companions facc ex-
hibited both apprehension and curiom-

   and why are the police anxious to
arrest some one ill the hotel dc mar-
rast   he demanded gruffly

   because the comte de plauex has
just been assassinated replied camp-
bell shortly

   xam ile dieii what are you say-
ing cried m jacques

   only that the count an old man
has been strangled  and do you know the
reason because he was unfortunate
enough to discover who it was that sent


the argosy

the marquis de marrast to the hastile
if you arc returning to meet your master
my friend beware or he may betray you
also

  the words produced the effect which
campbell had hoped in referring to
th vicomte dc lcsse he had only car-
ried out an idea which had taken root in
his mind the others action now con-
firmed fully the suspicion the scene which
he had witnessed before the gate of the
tuilcries had engendered

  a ferocious expression appeared upon
the face of m jacques he began to
tremble so violently that the flame of the
lantern was in danger of leing extin-
guished

   monsieur cried he in a terrible
voice  i have already been betrayed
do you know why you find me sneaking
back to the hotel de marrast like a thief
who fears the light of day it is be-
cause i am going to kill that ci-devant
that traitor who promised to make me
rich and instead would have permitted
me to be chained to an oar in a galley at
toulon

  he thrust the knife back into his belt
then with his free hand pointed to the
bruises upon his face

   look monsieur said he hoarsely
 because  defended myself they dragged
me over the pavement and he sitting
on his horse spoke no word in my behalf
why should i longer conceal anything
he is your nemy also and you will
know what to do

  he paused for a moment struggling
for breath then threw out his hand with
an imperative gesture

   listen monsieur said he savagely
you take me for an ordinary servant
even such a one as thnt iabrie hut 
am a soldier of france who for ten
years has worn with honor the uniform
of the king it was because this precious
vicomte de lessc detected me in a theft
that  fell into his power but i was
drunk at the time and did not know
what  was doing

   and what did he do instead of
putting me under arrest he promised to
say nothing provided i consented to
serve him faithfully it was that or dis-
grace and imprisonment and i choe the
safest way it was he who took me to
the htel dc marrast and persuaded the

marquis to offer me employment i was
to watch everything and report to him
daily

   mort du diahle it was a dogs life
but  had no choice in the matter he
pretended to leave france but all the
time he was at a chateau in the country
awaiting his opportunity if the mar-
quis was got rid of it was he who would
succeed to the title and dc marrasts
property only mademoiselle stood in the
way then he conceived the idea of
marrying her for in that case he would
be free to do as he chose

   hut believe me monsieur though the
girl had some liking for him she was
steadfast in refusing his advances then
he obtained from his patron the duke of
orleans a lettre de cachet it is probable
he stole it but that is no matter it
was very simple to fill in the blank with
the name of the marquis de marrast
and then what happened the marquis
was dragged off to the hastile

   it was just then you appeared mon-
sieur anti the vicomte had not counted
on that it was i under instructions
who was required to play the spy on the
old count and it was i who read the
letter he left lying on the table in the
library had i been more skilled in that
sort of business i would have concealed
or destroyed it for not doing so  re-
ceived a pretty lecture from my mnster

   well when you had gone there wa
nothing for me to do but keep watch on
the old nobleman and then last night
the vicomte put in an appearance ma-
king it appear he had just arrived in
paris something he said made the
count suspect him but as  had nothing
to do with that i can tell you nothing
hut this morning quite early who
should appear but mademoiselle

   i knew the vicomte was at the tuil-
erii and sent a message telling him
she had come back to paris afterward
thinking  might have an hur to myself
i went to the rue dc la cit well the
first thing i saw was you monsieur en-
tering a restaurant  entered also be-
lieving you would not know me and i
desired to sec what you could be doing
in suck a quarter of the city

   then it struck me the vicomte should
know you had returned to paris close
on the heels of mademoiselle i hast-
secret enemies



ened to the tuilcrics nnd just as i nr
rived who should come riding out but
the duke of orleans and among the gen-
tlemen behind him the vicomtc de i esse
in my excitement  forgot myself and
rushed forward brushing against the
dukes horse for that  was ordered to
be put under arrest and taken to the con-
ciergerie which meant toulon and per
haps a life sentence in the galleys

   i cricd out calling upon the vicomte
to save me but he never uttered a word
of protest a single sentence to the duke
would have ended the matter and i
should have been freed hut i under-
stand perfectly well he desired to gel rid
of me for there was no longer any spying
for me to do a man who is sentenced
to the galleys can tell no talcs monsieur

   the soldiers my old comrades
handled me roughly it is a wonder i
was not killed outright for i did not
submit tamely after a little i was sent
with two guards who were ordered 
take me to the concicrgcric where my
name should be entered as having in-
sulted the duke of orleans on the pub-
lic street one could not commit a worse
crime in france

   now i cannot tell you just what
happened monsieur for i was too dazed
to take much notice of anything but i
had gone only a little way when a iwxly
of citizens surrounded my captors some
one shouted that i was being taken to
the scaffold because i had failed to sa-
lute a party of royalists on all sides
arwse the cry  death to the aristocrats 
then the mob began to attack the sol-
diers who guarded me

   i stood still for i scarcely realized
what was taking place then suddenly
some one whispered in my car  run
citizen or reinforcements may arrive and
there will be too many for us i did
not need a second invitation when i
recovered my breath i found myself on
the bank of the seine and quite alone

   for a long time i crouched down
behind a pile of rubbish not caring what
became of me i knew i was a marked
man and to venture upon the streets
meant the conciergerie all i could do
was to wait for night and then hide my-
self somewhere

   then after a little a terrible rage
took possession of me from a soldier i

had become an outcast and it was all
due to that ci-devant who proposed to
rob his cousin of his liberty and riches
while he was enjoying himself  should
starve and finally die like a dog in the
gutter

   well after a time i began to cool
down and then a resolve came to me i
might indeed die but that fiend should
go before me and before i killed him
he should know the reason  did it i
figured out he would return to the hotel
de marrast for  had sent him word
that mademoiselle was there so much
the better for he would die in her pres-
ence just when he thought he had suc-
ceeded in everything

    knew a secret passage connected
the house with one of the underground
sewers for i have made use of this
route more than once  got up and
went along the bank of the river from a
boatman i obtained a lantern for a few
sous then it was nogreat trick to find
the entrance to this branch of the sewer
because i had marked it  a previous
occasion you know the rest monsieur
for i had walked scarcely fifteen min-
utes when we met had you not stopped
me i should have gone straight to the
hotel dc marrast and entered by the
cellar

  m jacques drew the back of his hand
across his niouth

   well monsieur he concluded
shortly

 campbell bad succeeded beyond his
expectations and he understood he now
had a powerful weapon in his hand with
which to strike his enemy hut just
then there was something more important
than permitting the ex-soldier to stick
his knife into the vicomte

   my friend said lie in a grave voice
 i will not deny you have strong provo-
cation but just now you cannot hope to
acuomplish much the vicomte is in
possession of the htel de marrast and
if you approach him you will be arrested
mademoiselle is  longer there and even
now lie may have followed her

  campbell then proceeded to explain
just what bad occurrcd that morning
and how he had cscaped from the counts
room by means of the secret passage be-
hind the panel

  m jacques listened attentively and


the argosy

the expression of his face was not pleas-
ant to look upon it was plain his rage
against the vicomte was so terrible that
he would not have hesitated to throw
himself upon him even on the crowded
boulevard

  in fact the man had given up every
thing as lost and thought only of re-
venge

  but as campbell concluded his expres-
sion changed

   tiens  lie cried  you say that
mademoiselle was driven away in a coach
that devil sent for her

   as i have told you under the ex-
cuse that she is to be taken to versailles
in order that together they may see the
king campbell replied

   socrt bleu growled the ex-soldier
 and do you fancy monsieur the girl
will be taken to versailles and
how will this vicomte meet her there
when he went straight from the duke
of orleans to the htcl dc marrast

   i do not think mademoiselle will
reach versailles to-day answered
campbell soberly

   nor to-morrow replied m jacques
with an unpleasant laugh

  then after a moments silence

   fortunately monsieur i have kept
my eyes and ears open and may prove of
some assistance in this matter it may
be possible i can do a service for made-
moiselle whom i have wronged and at
the same time accomplish what  have
planned

  and how is that campbell de-
manded

   well this vicomte has a house or at
least he is master there not much over
half a league from the outskirts of the
city  know the place well for it was
there i reported to him often now it
is in my mind that that is just the place
where mademoiselle will be taken no
one will suspect anything and with that
de charily to guard her she cannot es-
cape until the vicomte gives the order to
set her at liberty

   i do not fancy de charny will keep
her but go on my friend interposed
campbell dryly

   but de charny is the vieomtes
right hand and acts for him in every-
thing replied the other

   then his master must need fight left-

handed for  left de charny dead or
seriously wounded at an inn some leagues
from paris answered camplcll

   so much the better for the fellow
was an excellent fighter then it will be
all the easier answered his companion
 as i was saying the girl has probably
been taken to that house aod of course
the vicomte will go there also when he
has finished his business at the hotel de
marrast what have we to do but fol-
low you lo rescue mademoiselle and
i-

  he touched the handle of the knife
significantly

  campbell could scarcely suppress an
exclamation of satisfaction by a won-
derful stroke of good luck he had dis-
covered what under other circumstances
might have been impossible

   let us leave this place at once  he
cried

   with pleasure monsieur but you
have forgotten that  dare not show my-
self and besides wc cannot accomplish
anything by daylight the house is
guarded and wc should have only our
trouble for our pains besides there
should be more than two or wc will be
driven off or else taken prisoners

  campbell recognized that he spoke the
truth it would be no light matter to
force an entrance into a guarded house
within half a league of paris

  he began to question his companion
who replied that the place although not
large was strongly built and stood some
rods back from the road in a grove of
trees assault would not be impossible
but it must be quick and decisive or re-
inforcements from the neighborhood
would come to the assistance of those
who defended the building

  for a few moments campbell re-
mained in a brown study he was won-
dering where a sufficient force might be
obtained to attack the house that night
there were plenty of reckless spirits in
paris but to persuade any one to venture
on such an undertaking might be diffi-
cult and besides there was no time to
waste

  then an idea struck him m reuel
and the rue de la ciuh it might even
be possible to summon jean labrie if
reuel would send a messenger to the
htel de marrast
secret enemies	

  he hastened to acquaint the ex-soldier
with what was in his mind

  m jacques listened to the plan in
silcncc then he nodded

    par bleu it might be possible for the
rue de la cite is not over particular as
to how it turns a franc wc can at least
try it monsieur

  he took up the lantern which during
their conversation had been sputtering
on the damp bed of the sewer

   although we cannot go at once to
the rue de la cite i can at least permit
you to see daylight come monsieur
he said shortly

  for perhaps a mile campbell followed
his silent guide under the streets of paris

  finally far ahead a glimmer of light
pierced the darkness it grew largor the
somber gloom gave place to a misty dawn
and at length a great circular pipe was
visible in front of them it was the final
length of the sewer and its end opened
upon the seine

  m jacques blew out the lantern

   i will stop here monsieur he an-
nounced briefly

  campbell looked at his watch it
was two oclock he had been traveling
through the underground passages for
over three hours

  doing to the mouth of the pipe he gazed
out across the surface of the river in-
haling great breaths of the warm july
air then after a little he returned to
the ex-soldier who now presented a
grotesque figure

  covered with dirt through having
licen dragged over the cobblestones at
the gate of the tuileries his clothing
torn and his face bruised and caked with
dried blood it seemed improbable he
would be recognized even should he ven-
ture upon the streets

  rut when campbell suggested this the
man shook his head

   no monsieur said he  i am safer
where  am  for a few hours longer the
rats and i will keep company

  he smiled grimly and seated himself
upon the bottom of the sewer

  then after a few moments of silence
lie added

   put as it is necessary that some one
should go to the rue dc la cit there
is no reason why you should remain here
and you have nothing to fear

   but afterward i cnn scarcely find
again the entrance to this placc sug-
gested campbell

   it will not be necessary after night-
fall go to the tavern iu the rue de la
cite where you saw me this morning
you can then tell me what you have
done

  and you will be there

    certainly for  shall leave this placc
as soon as it is dark do not fear i will
fail you monsieur i do not forget that
we are to strike a blow against this
vicomlc who is just now thinking his
plotting has succeeded

  campbell turned again to the mouth
of the sewer from it to the narrow beach
at the edge of the water was a drop of
half a dozen feet on the edge he
paused

  tonight-at the tavern said he

   yes monsieur replied the other
shortly

  campbell dropped upon the lod of
pebbles under the mouth of the pipe

cl i apt p r xiv

tuk wolves ok paris

  it was halfan hour later when camp-
bell entered the rue de la cite and for
the third time that day climbed the stairs
which led to the rooms of m rcuel

  in response to his knock a gruff voicc
bade him enter pushing open the door
he stepped across the threshold  a man
who was seated near the window arose
quickly with a little exclamation it
was jean labrie

  campbell saw that the room was oc-
cupied by three others one of whom was
m rcuel his companions were evidently
residents of the rue dc la cit or of a
similar quarter of paris

  each met his gaze with a sullen stare
then glanced at m rcuel interroga-
tively

   it is m campbell the englishman
said the owner of the room gruffly

   a ci-devant if  the questioners
voicc was filled with suspicion

   possibly replied m rcucl  but
he is not the enemy of the people then
to campbell  well monsieur your
coming is unexpected  

  the brief sentence conveyed a qucs-


the argosy

tion campbell hastened to reply he
saw that these men suspected him and
just then he desired their good-wiu

   labric haft told you of what oc-
curred this morning he began

  he has tuld us also that you were
probably dead it seems he was mis-
taken replied m reuel

  campbell sank into a chair for he
was dreadfully weary until that moment
excitement had kept him up he had
forgotten that he had had practically no
sleep for sixty hours

  iabrie seized a watcr-pitcher from a
stand in the corner and filled a glass
when campbell had swallowed a few
mouthfuls he felt somewhat refreshed
but was obliged to rest heavily against
the table

   monsieur said the butler of the
hotel de marraftt do not hurry your-
self though wc arc anxious to hear what
you have to tell us

  hut campbell controlled hi weakness
by an effort

   for nearly four hours i have been
wandering through the sewers of paris
he explained

   so it would seem monsieur replied
m reuel and glanced at the visitors
mud-bespattered shoes and clothing

  campbell proceeded to relate every-
thing which had occurred from the time

iabrie had left him to summon a physi-
cian to the moment when he dropped
from the mouth of the sewer

  when he finished his four companions
looked at one another then one of the
strangers began to laugh

   pardon me monsieur said he  but

	was thinking what that ci-devant must
have thought when he unlocked the door
of the room and found only a dead man
to turn over to th police he must
have fancied you were the devil and had
flown out of the window

   he was in a terrible rage put in
labrie  and i can tell you they searched
the apartment carefully  even tearing the
bed in pieces as for me  thought that
vicomte had really killed you and con-
cealed your body for he is very cunning
and so you have met that fellow
jacques well when i see him there is
a little matter t be settled between us

   liens broke in m reuel sharply
 you are to do nothing my friend you

have heard what monsieur has just told
us this ex-soldier is going to prove use-
ful already he has offered to lead
some one to the house where your vicomte
has taken the girl turn him loose among
the ci-devants and he will be equal to
half a battalion when it comes to fight
ing for the people there is going to be
plenty of work for all of us

  labrie began to mutter and relapsed
into ullcn silence m reuel turned to
campbell

   monsieur said he  it is plain why
you have come here for the sccond time
to-day you understand perfectly well
you can do nothing without some assist-
ance what you desire is that wc take
from the hands of one nobleman the
sister of another

  	and why should we who are of the
people trouble ourselves about the safety
of a ci-devant  demanded one of the
others grufily

   i will not ask any one to do uch a
thing for nothing began campbell for
he knew of no other reply to this argu-
ment

  m reuel made an impatient gesture

   you arc addressing members of the
national assembly and you talk of offer
ing a few paltry francs it is always that
way with you cidevants as if the com
moil people are to be bought and sold
like so many cattle said he in a stern
voice

  campbell began to apologize but the
frenchman interrupted

   hut we uderstand monsieur your
anxiety two facts  have in my mind
this marquis de marrast has proved him-
self a friend of the people for he among
others endeavored to persuade the king
to receive at versailles the tiers i-tat as
befitted those whom we represented-the
backbone of france on the other hand
it was this duke of orleans who is the
patron of the vicomte dc lcsse that
urged the king to do otherwise

  on the th of june louis insulted
us and his swiss even fired upon the
multitude who followed to back up our
petition and on the th matters be-
came still more unendurable the king
ordered closed the doors of the building
in which the national assembly held its
meetings that also the marquis dc
marrast opposed therefore it became
secret enemies



easier for this vicomte to bundle him off
to the bastilc

   from which we will liberate him in
the name of the people broke uut one
of the other men

  m reuel signified that the interrup-
tion was untimely and continued

   we arc not without gratitude though
at versailles they consider wc carc for
nothing but to fill our stomachs under
ordinary circumstances it would be noth-
ing to us what became of this sister of a
nobleman but  am thinking of the mar-
quis de marrast who spoke u good word
for the people and that other who would
permit a frenchman to be sent to the
galleys at toulon because he brushed
against the horse of that wretched duke
we will tcach this ci-devant a lesson
monsieur-and deliver the girl to yon

  campbell began to express his grat-
itude but again the other checked him

  it is to serve our purpose more than
your own i have consented to aid you
said he gruffly

  jean labrie was rubbing his hands to-
gether

   par bleu  he muttered bringing his
fist down on the table  yes we are go-
ing to teach them something those who
have imprisoned the marquis and mur-
dered an old man

  m reuel cut him short also

   and now monsieur  said lie there
is no reason why you should not rest
until evening in the mean time i will
attend to everything

  campbell did not need a second invi-
tation for to keep his eye open a half-
hour longer seemed impossible m
reuel led the way into another room in
which stood an iron bedstead lie mo-
tioned toward the latter and retired
closing the door

  it seemed to campbell he had slept
for scarcely a moment when he was
aroused by a hand shaking him vigorous-
ly opening his eyes he saw jean la-
brie bending over him

   it is nine oclock  come monsieur
explained the butler

  for several moments campbell strug-
gled with the drowsiness which weighed
heavily upon him then got upon his feel
looking through the window he saw that
it was already dark  arranging his attire
he followed labrie into the larger room

  m reuel was standing beside the win-
dow which was open through it
drifted a strange ominous sound which
bore some resemblance to the dull sullen
murmur of the sea beating upon a rocky
shore by a little gesture the french-
man summoned campbell to his side

   look down monsieur  said lie
briefly

  campbell leaned across the sill
fifty feet below the narrow rue de la
cite seemed to be filled with a moving
mass which swayed backward and for
ward above this restless surface
gleamed here and there flaring torches
and from it arose the sullen murmur
which had at first attracted and puzzled
the young scotchman

  look said the frenchman calmly
 the children of paris monsieur

  to campbell it appeared an angry
mob surging up and down the narrow
street his companion read his thoughts
and smiled grimly

   and there are scarcely three hundred
down there while in paris there are
many thousands-in the rue st jacques
de la vannerie the faubourg st an-
toine-the rue tie la cite is only a little
corner monsieur at versailles are the
king and his nobles here in paris a
guard surrounds the tuileries bayonets
bristle before the hotel de villc and
cannon frown from the bastions of the
bastilc because of their vaunted
strength these ci-devants mock at the pe-
titions of the people who possess only
their bare hands with which to defend
themselves

  he stepped back from the window the
grim smile still playing about his lips

   comc monsieur  said he gravely
 they are waiting to follow you to the
house of the vicomte dc lcssc do not
try their patience

  campbell had expected a handful of
recruits not more than half a dozen and
in their stead he found a restless mob
he hesitated and drew bark

  to join in a private assault against a
personal enemy was one thing but to
lead a rabbit through the streets of paris
quite another it was rebellion against
the kings authority

  m reuel noted his hesitation

   aor du dieu are you afraid mon-
sieur  lie demanded roughly

	a


the argosy

  campbell squared his shoulders it was
too late lo turn back to save mile
dc marrast he must accept the assistance
which the national assembly oltered
him even if it ended in the conciergcrie
or something worse

  without a word he signified to his
companion that he was ready to follow
him down the stairs whence jean labrie
had already gone

  reaching the level of the street the
personality and actions of the mob be-
came plainer the crowd which filled the
rue de la cite seemed to be composed
of every manner of man who inhabited
the lower quarters of paris

  a few were armed with weapons but
for the most part the waving hands
brandished clubs fashioned from spokes
torn from cart wheels here and there
a pike arose like a slender tree above
the surging mass on such implements
there were to be borne later heads hewed
from the shoulders of aristocrats

  many in the crowd were half-clothed
but a few wore uniforms which had once
covered the barks of the kings soldiers
now and then campbell could see a red
cap balanced on an unkempt head  such
appeared to be treated with respect by
thcii neighbors

  when m rcuel appeared in the door-
way opening on to the street the shouts
of the mob redoubled and took form a
huge fellow brandished a rart spoke al-
most under campbells nose while he
bawled in his cars

  long live the national assembly
long live the citizen committeeman i
a has ies ei-dnvants  down with aris-
tocrats

  and the mob took up the cry howling
like a pack of hungry wolves

  m rcuel pushed his way among those
who crowded nearest and campbell his
brain in a whirl kept close at his heels
upon the threshold of the little tavern
the frenchman halted and motioned to
his companion to enter

  campbell obeyed and as hr stepped
into the uncertain light shed by the few
sputtering candles a man who was seated
at a table in the corner of the room
arose and greeted him it was m
j acques

   mort du diable  cried the ex-sol-
dier with a hasty gesture toward the

street  is it the revolution or only
your garde du corps you have out there
monsieur at first  forgot i no longer
served the king and cxpectcd to be torn
to pieces but it is evident they arc only
waiting for some one

  it is for us my friend to lead them
to the house of the vieomte replied
campbell hoarsely

   iom de acl it is not a fortress we
arc going against monsieur

  campbell explained for a moment
his companion remained silent then
shrugged his shoulders

   well it is all the same to me so
long as i am permitted to be the first to
reach that villain  but hnvc a care mon-
sieur or mademoiselle will die of fright
come i am ready he growled

  for many months afterward campbell
remembered that march through the
streets of paris when at every moment
he expected to find himself engaged iu a
fight with the authorities hut the mob
was not molested but increased in size as
it proceeded across the seine through a
gate at which the guard made no oppo-
sition out upon the country road fol-
lowing the guidance of m jacques

  and at last the latter stopped and
pointed out a grove of trees standing
some distance back from the highway

  it is there said he turning to m
rcuel

  for it was rcuel who was directing
everything and his word swayed the
mob in what direction he chose camp-
bell ijecame impressed with the feeling
that he was only a mere spectator swal-
lowed up and carried forward in the
human torrent which rolled along the
road from paris and this torrent
might at any moment turn and over
whelm him

  a short consultation followed the cx-
soldiers announcement then the leader
summoned to his side several of his fol-
lowers who were better armed than the
majority of the rabble he beckoned to
campbell

    shall surround the place which i
see is protected by a stone wall said
he  then in company with these citi-
zens we will approach the house and de-
mand admittance in the name of the
people are you armed monsieur 
campbell replied that he had a pistol
at my ladys skrvick



   which i de not think you will bo
required to use still no one can tell what
may happen

  m reuel gave an order and the mob
disintegrating spread out like an im-
mense fan encircling the prove of trees
completely as far as one could sec a
line of torches flared red in the darkness
and if these did not attract the attention
of those in the house the sullen murmur
of the encircling host must have warned
them that an unusual thing was happen-
ing

  m reuel waited until everything was
arranged to his sattniaction then ap-
proached the wall pushed open an iron
gate and walked boldly up the path
which led to the entrance of the dwell-
ing

  campbell looked curiously at his com-
panions those who accompanied him
and the leader through the gate numbered
half a dozen the ex-soldier jean la-
brie and four citizens these latter
were armed two with muskets a third
with an immense cavalry saber nnd the
fourth carried a pike

  m reuel knocked loudly upon the
door a window above his head opened
and a gruff voice demanded who was
there and what was wanted

    pcn in the name of the people i 
replied the committeeman sternly

  there was a moments silence then the
voice answered

   go about your business this is the
house of m the vicomte de iesse-we
do not recognize your authority to de-
mand admittance

  m reuel turned to one of his follow-
ers

   place the muzzle of your musket
against the lock of the door-and fire
he ordered sharply

  the man did so the report echoed
through the grove and was answered by
a howl from the encircling mob the
panel of the door was shattered for the
musket had been charged with pieces of
iron and lead slugs

  an oath came from the window and
an answering shot from a pistol but the
bullet did not hit any one m reuel
looked upward

                   the wrong man to the rescuc nnd how he turned
                   out to be the right one in a tight place after all

 a ll right ive got the message
bennett hung up the telephone
receiver and turned in perplexity to
griswold sitting at a desk near him

  the two young lawyers shared the
same office-stenographer law-books and
everything pertaining to the legal pro-
fession as well as the personal matters
of each others daily life

   another promise broken he con-
tinued  another proof that one should
never swear to do anything unless the
character of the thing is clear

  trouble hen queried griswold

   nothing serious  guess

   well go ahead and tell me

   you know gris how much legal
work i have done for miss trowbridge

and how many times wc have talked over
the phone together well of course
we have become pretty well acquainted
though we have never seen each other
we have even come to the point of hav-
ing violent discussions concerning the
respective merits of automobiles-which
is a subject about which you know noth-
ing and with which you have no sym-
pathy-and she had great respect for my
knowledge it seems

   about a week ago when i managed
something connected with her property
rather successfully and at some trouble
 made the foolish remark over the phone
to her that there was nothing i would
not do for her-no engagement  would
not break in order to receive her words


the argosy

of praise of course she laughed and
said that men were very willing to make
such promises hut fulfilling them was
another matter and she said it as though
she had had sonic experience in the line
well some way the tone of her voice-
or something perhaps the recollection
that she has the reputation of being the
most beautiful girl that ever visits this
city-made me swear by all that wo
holy that  meant what  said-and i
did too

   now just this minute comes a mes-
sage from her over the wire that she wants
me at oncc and whcrt do you think -
five miles out of the city on that forlorn
state road of course it would be a
great pleasure to go and help her
but in five minutes  have to argue
in court the most important case of my
extensive legal career -is you know and
 simply cannot go she will understand
when  tell her about it and will not
blame me but i would like to be able
to keep my word-just for the romance
of the thing if nothing more

  griswold  merry gris his friends
called him looked at his friend in mock
sympathy

   sentimental ben was all he said

  the latter was arranging his legal
papers preparatory to leaving for court
when he stopped suddenly and regard
cd the laughing eyes of the other with
anxiety

   say gris he said slowly  suppose
it was something serious suppose she
needs some one badly

   well let her get some one then
replied the other

   but she expects me objected ben-
nett  and perhaps relies upon what i
said the other day

   theres a possibility - began gris-
wold but was interrupted by his friend

  of course he said you must go
for me if i cant keep my word i can
at least send a substitute and comc out
there myself jut as soon as my case is
finished comc on now -hurry up

  the suggestion evidently appealed to
the adventurous nature of griswold and
his gay mind instantly seized at the
chance of extracting some humor out of
his friends request

  bennett had scarcely rcached the
court-house before griswold was sealed

in the trap he had ordered from a near-
by livery stable and was well on his way
toward the spot in the state highway
wflerc his friend was expected

  an automobile would have been n
more rapid means of reaching his desti-
nation but the young mans ignorance of
the mechanism of such vehicles was as
dense as was bennetts knowledge of the
entire motor outfit

  to accomplish the purpose for which
his friend had sent him in a stereotyped
manner would have leen impossible for
griswold and he had thoroughly made
up his mind to present himself as ben-
nett when he rounded a curve in the
road and came upon the party of whom
he was in search

  the glad cries that came from the two
girls sitting by the roadside assured gris-
wold that he was expected-or rather
that ben was fhc meeting was so sud-
den the greeting so cordinl that there
was no time to conceive of new plans

   yes  am bennett lied the young
man   i got your message some time ago
but you sec my automobile-

  and then a horrible suspicion seized
him

  standing at the side of the road show-
ing no indication of life was a huge
touring-car griswolds eyes lingered
upon its mysterious machinery a moment
and then sought confirmation of his fears
in the costumes of the girls

  motoring outfits enveloped them yes 
they evidently belonged to the car and
the car belonged anywhere but here
waiting for griswold to ascertain the
cause of its refusal to run

   you see laughed the girl who had
introduced herself as miss trowbridge
 wc foolishly thought we could run the
ear ourselves-and we could if the old
thing had only not balked  put just be-
fore we telephoned you it stopped dead
we cant imagine what is the matter

   of course we thought of sending
word by the farmer who drove by and
offered to telephone for us from his place
several miles up the road instead of
telephoning to the garage however for
a man who makes a business of help-
ing motorists in distress i conceived the
brilliant idea of testing your promise and
sending for you -im awfully glnd
you came
at my ladys service



    and i that you sent for me again
 prevaricated griswold with a quizzical
 glance at the machine

   this is miss martin continued miss
 trowbridge and now that everything
 hah comc out so nicely  suppose all you
 have to do is to touch some one spot with
 your magic intuition and start the car
 for us

    oh it may not be so simple gris-
 wold warned her as he tied his horse to
 the fence and turned to a solemn con-
 templation of the thing standing sul-
 lenly there before him

    his course of procedure was plain ex-
 amine the machinery test every screw and
 valve in sight and delve for those which
 must be hidden somewhere and try to
 kill the time until bennett should ap-
 pear

   confess to the deception now he would
 not and a moments thought concerning
 the girls standing beside him convinced
 him that they would appreciate the hu-
 mor of the situation when the time came
 for explanations

     i think possibly it may be the spark-
 plugs suggested miss trowbridge as
 griswold began the tampering which he
 sincerely trusted would not injure the
 works

    oh no he replied   it cant be
 that said the young man in his igno-
 rance moved as far from tlie suggested
 seat of difficulty as possible

    you might sec if the gasoline has
 run out put in miss martin

    in a moment he murmured not
 having the faintest idea where that neces-
 sary liquid was stored and in the hope
 that he would find it by chance

     the difficulty is far more apt to be
 in connection with the gulch wisely
 commented griswold sure that he had
 heard that word used by his motor-mad
 friends

   the what asked miss trowbridge
 in wonder

     oh i forgot hastily interjected the
 man angry at himself for running the
 risk of making such a mistake  you
 are not one of the thoroughly initiated
  as yet and possibly do not understand
 what i mean you see automobiling has
 become so common that we -modestly
 - who consider ourselves experts have
 private names for the more intricate

part of the machine the gulch is - is-
the very basis of the theory of the work-
ing of the automobile it is-

  griswold stopped and gave vent to a
slow whistle of amazement as he pushed
violently back and forth the small brass
lever connected with the steering appa-
ratus he had no idea of the use to
which these things were put nor was
there any cause for his whistle of amaze-
ment but some important discovery was
necessary to enable him to cease his dc
scription of the  gulch which was get-
ting him into deep miter

   what is it   cried both the girls at
once

   i think i have discovered the cause
of the trouble answered griswold
 and i am sorry to say it is rather
serious

  he stood for a moment shaking hte
head in doubt glancing occasionally
down the road to see if bennett was by
any possibility in sight suddenly he
seized a long thing of brass which ex
tended from the side of the car and
moved it forward

   oh wont that make it go queried
miss trowbridge

    it doesnt seem to

   i mean wouldnt it if the machine
was all right she added

   i cant imagine this machine all
right sighed the young man

  they had leen at work investigating
for some time and griswold considered
that he had earned a smoke with the
idea of occupying as long a period as
possible in the preparation of his luxury
that he might give bennett an opportu-
nity to come to his rescue he seated him-
self on the stone within an inch of which
the automobile had run in its last hight
and slowly filled his pipe

   i know you are tired apologized
miss trowbridge and its awfully good
of you to help u but i think we had
lxitter get in your trap and drive bark to
the city its getting late

   i should love to take you said
griswold  and if  can do nothing
after one more try perhaps we had let-
ter return m that way hut he con-
tinued with his eyes upon mis martin
who seemed to him far more interesting
than the celebrated beauty miss trow-
bridge  i hate to let the thing get


the argosy

the best of me its so humiliating you
know

  there was an almolute silence ou the
part of all each mind intent upon the so
lution of the problem before them then
suddenly a great inspiration seemed to
comc to one of the party

  miss trowbridge moved hastily to the
starting apparatus mi martin stand-
ing directly in front of the machine
caught the inspiration and stood rigid
griswold at a loss remained seated on
the stone hi hand resting on the front
wheel of the motor

  there was the sound of a quick turn
of a crank a rumble and whir a sudden
leap of the machine-and then silencc
again

   its lucky it stopped exclaimed
miss trowbridge as she assisted miss
martin from the ground where she had
been thrown by the sudden starting of
the car  or you would have lieen badly
hurt

  she turned toward the place where
griswold had lecn sitting and con-
tinued you see mr bennett you did
set the clutch in the slow speed so that
the car would start as soon as the en-
gine did i-

  the engines had stopped again and
both girls rushed around to the stone
which had been the mans resting-place
he was near it still but lying with his
head almost under the machine his arms
outstretched his eyes closed and one leg
pinioned between the hub of the rear
wheel of the car and the stone

   oh i  cried both girls aghast

  then in a moment they dashed to the
rear of the machine and pressed with all
their strength against it hut the heavy
automobile did not move an inch and
the same result followed their attempt
from the front griswold was pinioned
fast

   miss martin he called hoarsely
 im all right -dont you bother your
head about me my-my friend will be
here soon

   but youll die like that cried the
girl coining in anguish to his side

   i-i am rather twisted but i can
stand it 

  his courage was wonderful

  with ever lessening strength the girls
continued their attempts to move the ma-

chine but no success followed their
efforts

  at length miss martin with a glance
at the pale face on the ground threw
herself beside griswold and gently raised
his head to her lap

   is that better she asked

   pcrfcct

   how can you stand it it must be
awfully painful

   ill confess i-

 an exclamation from miss trow
bridge interrupted him as bennett
dashed around the bend in the road and
brought his automobile to a standstill
near the agitated party his first glancc
at the disabled car brought forth a tre-
mendous roar

   think of griswold to the rescue of
a motor party  he shouted

   i dont know who you are sir
cried miss trowbridge  but for heav-
ens sake help our friend out of his
tcrriblo position

   why im bennett replied the
young man as he turned and followed
the girl  i-

  when he saw his friend lying on the
ground bennett made an impulsive dash
to his side

  gris he cried and then he stood
motionless by the side of the car

  was it possible that one of the humor-
ous eyes of griswold executed a wink
from its place in the soft folds of miss
martins gown

   before you relieve me said gris-
wold slowly  let me confess that i have
impersonated you my dearest friend be-
fore these ladies-and see-see my re-
ward

  oh help him came the female

voices

  hut griswold held up a staying hand

   no-not until i am forgiven he
said melodramatically

  oil whoever you are- began miss
martin

   i cant understand cried miss
trowbridge this is incomprehensi-
ble then turning to bennett cant
you see the man before you why his
leg-his leg-it must be crushed to
pieces-and broken  

   possibly it is both came a voice
from under the automobile but its
also wooden i

                    the series of fearsome happening that set wide-awake
                    a certain little sleepy village on the atlantic coast

chapter xix

how  all happened

with my pull on that thin little
wire the solution of the mys-
terious visits to the house lay before me
the entire grate of the fireplace in the
dining-room lifted at the inner end as
though it was on hinges i did not take
time to make any examination  crawled
into the room with joel after me

   ah i  he said  we arc safe
they will hardly tacklc us to-night
and now if youve got time you can
take this bullet out of my leg

  as a matter of fact there was no bul-
let in his leg he had been shot in the
fleshy part of the thigh and the bullet
had plowed right through all he
wanted was a little bandaging  the salt
water had nearly stopped the bleeding

  we were both pretty well shaken up
by our experience

   and now the thing is over for the
present i said for heavens sake tell
me how you learned that the secret way
was through the chimney under the fire-
place  never thought of trying that
it looked so solid

  it is solid even if you had tried
it you couldnt have moved it but she
told me how

  she the girl has she recovered
as much as that 

   sure mother says shes all right
except for that wound in her shoulder
of course when t got here i expected to
find you  rang the bell and nobody
came and that surprised me

   i rang again and waited and still
nobody came then i gave her a yank
that durn near pulled her out altogether

   mother came to the door looking as
if she was astonished

 organ a ugvtt aitooar

    i thought mr dell would answer
it she said  he went to smoke while
i attended the girl

   well i looked all around through
the house and outside and the only place
i could smell cigar-smoke was in the
library i told mother

is the horse outside she asked

  yes i said

  its queer said mother it aint
like mr dell to go far away at a time
like this

   the door of the girls room was
open and she heard us

  is mr dell missing she asked
 answered that you were she called
us in  look in the fireplace she sug-
gested  theres a tiny hook about half-
way up on the right side get your fin-
ger in that and pull look down

   well i did ever get a surprise
that chimney is three times as big below
the floor as it is above and it goes
right on down through the cellar floor
into that cave no wonder we didnt find
it why you might tinker with that old
fireplace a week and never find that hook
and if you did find it you wouldnt know
what to do with it oh its a great
scheme that i dont know how she
works but youve seen she does

   well they wont come up to-night

i said they are soaking wet even if
you havent drowned them and one can
watch or we can block up the fireplace

i want to get the girls story

  mrs bankred had heard us talking
she came to the kitchen where i had
been working over joel

   iordyl whatever has happened
she cried aghast as she saw joel with
his trousers oft and one leg bandaged
and his clothes in a wet heap on the
floor

singlt eopiti 




the argosy

   i found him rw i said mother tied
to the iron ladder said joel   didnt
have much time to lose and i had a
little scrimmage and got dumped in the
sea but its all right

  hut that bandage

  oh that aint much when you have
a fight you expect to get a little hurt
hut hows the girl mr dell wants to
get her story

   thats what  came out for-that
and to see how you- were she is all
right only there is a little fever setting
in and i think wc ought to have the do
tor i thought you could go but-

   so i can this aint much and
the horse is there ill go get the doc-
tor if mr dell will let me have some
clothes and you go get her story

  off the brave fellow limped and i ac-
companied mrs bankred to the girls
bedside

  in the cxcitcmcnt of getting her there
and trying to resuscitate her i had paid
very little attention to her face except to
note that it was handsome rather than
beautiful now as i entered her eyes
which had been elosed before looked at
me with a peculiar expression

  she held out the hand of the uninjured
side

   i am so sorry she said  that i
fainted before i warned you it was so
weak of me

  it seems to me i answered that
you have done heroically as it is i un-
derstand from the conversation of the
two men who capturcd me that you were
wounded trying to get to me to warn
me

   i jumped from the boat she said
 and i was shot in the water

  what devils  passionately ex-
claimed  strange that you should be
with them at all

   i have escaped she explained  but
tliey always found me and i have
never been up north before i knew
nobody i feared nobody would believe
my story and then after mr wration
was killed i dared not go

   because you played a part in his
murder 

   dont  she cried and her eyes filled
with tears while sobs shook her frame
 i did-but i did not know it i did
not know it

   i can believe that well enough i
said  after what you have done for me
but why didnt you leave me some infor-
mation about the secret passage when
you wrote the note

  she opened her eyes wide

   i thought i did didnt i say any-
thing about it

   no your note was hurriedly writ-
ten and rather incoherent i suppose in
your excitement you intended to and
omitted it

   oh-what a blunder and it might
have saved so much she said closing
her eyes

  tears were running down her checks
and i knew the girl however blundering
she might be was sincere she was only
a girl scarcely eighteen and could not be
expected to plan with an adult head

  now what can you tell me i
asked

   about the two mur-the two men
who were killed 

   yes and about yourself

   beginning with myself if you will
let me my name-i think-is kate da-
nella my father is dead at least i
have always been led to believe that and
i think it is true my mother lives in
nassau new providcncc william
wratton was her brother

   your uncle and you did not de-
nounce his murder

   lie was a wicked man he robbed
my mother and it was another uncle
ferdinand danella who killed him one
was as bad as the other

   tell me about it-how it was done

   my mother was left by my father in
very good circumstances he had owned
a line of ships running from england to
south america and the island ports and
she had her brother william wratton
take up the management he was a
wicked man and used the ships for pur-
poses my mother would not dream of
and then little by little he began to
get the best of her and finally lie sold
her out and bought the line of ships for
a mere song so it was really my
mothers ship he sold the scipio

  and my fathers brother who is no
better than william wratton got his
gang of cutthroats together telling my
mother lie would get the money for her
but it was not his intention to give my
taking big chances



mother anything he is a terrible man
this danella he has lived north here
andknew all about this house it be-
longs to a man he knows and who is now
m england

   the owners name is matika they
are remnants of a rang that used to carry
on a great smuggling trade and thin
house was used by the gang even before
my uncle was born it was a regular
trade and in those days there were men
in broggan who knew all about it and
helped the rang

   the secret passage through the lower
part of the chimney mafic it possible to
land goods at low tide and go and come
even when the officers were watching the
house broggan has not always been
the sleepy place they say it is now
some of the people here are living on

what was made ly their ancestors in this
very house

   perhaps they know it and perhaps
not i know all this from hearing my
uncle and other of the gang talk they
tried to have no secrets from me they
looked upon me as one of them until i
refused to murder you

   william wratton my mothers
brother came here to sell the scipio
ferdinand danolla my fathers brother
knew of it and told my mother he would
see that she received the money the
scipio was too large and too slow for
w ratton in these days and he wanted a
smaller and swifter vessel

   danela knew all this somehow and
proposed coming here in the muriel
his own vessel almost like a large yacht
he asked me to take the voyage and not
knowing what horrors i was destined to
meet i accepted the invitation

   danella planned the whole thing
you see the capiain and crew of the
muriel are half-way decent men and did
not know what was contemplated by da-
nella and the four men with him they
would smuggle rum or tobacco but when
it came to murder and robbery they could
not be trusted so danella had to plan
and this was how it was done

   one of the gang whom william
wratton did not know waited until he
had sold the scipio for cash and then
met him and said he understood wratton
wanted a swift vessel so he did and
after they had talked about it wratton

agreed to take a trial trip on the muriel
danella wafl on board but pretended to
beill so that he and wratton did not
meet hut i saw my uncle william
though he did not recognize me  had
been away to school in england for a
long time

   hut danella told me to introduce
myself and explain my presence on the
muriel by saying she had hailed from
nassau and  had taken the trip for my
health

   wratton looked queer but he did not
say anything being a wicked man him-
self he was always suspicious of every
one and always on guard then dan-
ella compelled me to accompany him to
this house we came up the secret pas-
sage but  had no idea what his plans
were he forced me to write a letter to
wratton that i had got into trouble while
on shore and was in an old stone house
that had been turned into a prison and
i had let a prison guard make love to me
and this guard would permit somebody
to come up through the chimney to rescue
me but whoever came must be careful

   wratton knew nothing of the old
house while danella knew all about it
and wratton was an adventurous man
anyway danella knew he would come

   then danella locked me in a room
alone i heard wratton come and when
he was in the room another of the gang
with him i heard him cry out he
recognized danella

   it was done quickly and i screamed
and tried to break out a window and
escape thats why they left the body
i screamed so loud and it was nearly
daylight they were frightened and then
the next day you came and they could
not go back but they got the money

   i guess you understand it all now
it was one of the gang that killed war
son you sec warson had been looking
at the muriel from below here and one
of the gang went ashore they drank
together and jim the one who shot me
told him a lot of stuff that wasnt true

   he intended to get warson drunk
and kill him then hut when warson
was half drugged into insensibility he
got suspicious struck j im in the face and
ran away that night they came in and
killed him

   why didnt they kill me


the argosy

   you were not dangerous then they
had done enough

   hut why did they compel you a mere
child to come here to kill me 

   because they were afraid of me
they knew that  intended to expose
their crimes and they wanted to make
me as wicked as themselves to compel
me to hold my tongue from fear i was
crying all the time and watching for a
chance to escape and danella knew it

  he swore he would compcl me to
compromise myself so that for my own
self-protection i would keep still about
them thats why he sent me to kill
you if  did that  would never dare
expose him instead of killing you i
wrote that letter men were waiting
below for me in the launch i was ter-
ribly frightened  scarcely knew what
i was writing anything to warn you

   that accounts for your saying noth-
ing about the fireplace i said  and
now-

  rut suddenly the girl was lying back
limp on her pillow in a dead faint

chapter xx

where uroccan came into the story

   dr griggs mr dell

  joel limped to the door of the room
and then away again

  in the doorway stood the typical old
country doctor tall inclined to stout-
ness grim as to face with kindliness
brimming over in his eyes

  she has fainted doctor i said
and i wish you to do everything in your
power for her i have just listened to a
very strange and interesting xfory when
you get her so that you can leave her for
a time if you will comc to the library i
will tell you the story while you take a
look at joels leg

    joels leg seems to have been ittend-
ed to pretty well sir he answered we
will bend ail our energies on this poor
girl joel has told me much evidently
she is a brave girl for so young a one

    do all you can its my bill i said
and i joined joel

   the first thing i began  is to
block this confounded fireplace so that
well have no surprises well lay the
ghost as they say in ghost stories

   lets see how sne works said joel

  we pulled the hook again and it was
marvelous how the heavy grate swung
up it left an aperture amply large
enough to admit the body of a good-
sized man and if there was an ordinary
fire in the grate all it would do would be
to spill it backward upsetting it a little
but not placing the house in danger

  the floor of the fireplace was a flat
stone that just covered the hole this
was fastened to a horizontal bar of iron
hinged at the back and beyond that
was an iron ball that balanced the whole
contrivance sufficiently to enable even a
child to open the fireplace hack of it
there was a sort of pocket to give the
ball which was at the end of an iron
balancing rod plenty of play room and
might also serve as a secrct hiding-place
for gold or silver or other booty of
course there was none there now

   i dont like to spoil this arrange-
ment i said  its fine it not only
serves as a secret way into and from the
house but it gives a direct communica-
tion with the sea at low tide without
making a long detour around the cliffs
well just jam a barrel or something in
there temporarily that will keep them
out

  i dont fancy theyll come again
replied joel too many of us know
about it now and they cant massacre all
broggan they know the girl is here
though they may try to get her

   they wont get her i said savagely
 they wont get that girl again while
im alive

   eh so soon queried joel

    i didnt say anything to make you
stare the girl was shot trying to come
and warn me isnt that enough to make
me want to protect her  

   sure

  after we had jammed the fireplace for
setmrity i took a look around outside the
house but there was no one there i re-
turned the doctor was examining joels
leg

   you did very well he said  the
wound is nothing

  we all lit cigars

   how is your patient  i asked

   shes all right wants a little nurs-
ing and ive arranged for mrs bankrcd
to take her home mrs hankred is the
taking big chances



best nurse in broggan fortunate thing
you happened to strike her

   it was not a happen she was the
only woman in broggan i knew

   i then repeated the story the girl had
told

   it is a most interesting story and a
straight one said the old physician
 she is a brave girl i asked her how
she received the wound it seems she
had just as she told you been brought
here to murder you her uncle and the
rest of that amiable crowd thought that
if she actually committed a murder she
would keep her mouth shut well she
told them that she had they were dc
lighted but lo they discovered this
evening that you had not been harmed
they were lying offshore around the
point where you could not see the muriel

   her uncle gave her a beating and
was going to put her in irons she heard
at the same time orders for two men to
put out in the launch and do the job she
had failed to do before you did them any
harm being a good swimmer she leaped
jnto the sea and one miscreant they call
jim who wanted to marry her called to
her to come back or he would shoot her

   she paid no heed and he did shoot
arrd she sank for a moment i suppose
the fellow thought she was dead yvcll
she swam ashore but a girl like that
cant stand a bullet wound like a man
and though she reached your door she
fainted before she rould warn you

   but thank god you are safe now
it wont be a difficult matter to seize the
muriel now

  v by jove  must attend to that at
once i said

  i rushed from the house and leaving
the doctor to wait for me i drove at a
furious pace to the station at vadcrs
here i telegraphed in all directions to
intercept the muriel and arrest all on
board as murderers of william wratton
and david warson then i drove back
and found the man of medicine still there

   you have a rather unceremonious
way of taking your departure he said 
but you did well i was going to tell
you before you rushed away that i knew
something about this smuggling business
myself but we physicians do not disclose
secrets confided to us by patients

the

    of course the tales of the old house
being haunted were bosh they were
invented years ago by those engaged in
the traffic they made lights dance at
night in the windows and did everything
in order to give llavor to the story

    the owner of the house matika al-
though he perhaps never actually look
part in any of the work reaped a benefit
nobody in broggan knows him he
bought the place from his uncles estate
and his uncle like miss danollas was
one of the rankest old freebooters and
smugglers the world ever saw

    theres many a cask of jamaica rum
and pound of tobacco been brought up
through that old chimney

    i wonder if this matika would sell
the place i said  i rather like it

    i fancy he would be glad to it has
brought him in no revenue

   ill have jicks write him by the
way - j icks being agent must know
something about that chimney

   no jicks knows nothing about the
chimney nobody in broggan knows
about it i only guessed it one day when
i attended a wounded west indian i
swore i would never divulge the secret

   we had a pleasant chat then i drove
the doctor home and it was daylight

   there was activity on the sea that day
boats shot out of harbors all along the
coast from boston to cape hatteras
ferdinand danella did not have time to
change the name of his swift vessel he
did attempt to give battle knowing there
was no hope for him if captured and
was killed by a well-directed shot

   the others surrendered

   the six hundred thousand dollars was
found intact in danellas stateroom and
was at once placed subject to the order
of mrs danella of nassau officers of
the law and representatives of news-
papers crowded the house and full state-
ments were made and sworn to

  kate danella was removed to joels
house where under the care of mrs
bankred she steadily improved i spent
a great deal of time there after she got
well enough to sit on the porch

  we like broggan pretty well now
kate and  and-but whats the use
ive told all the story you want to hear
the rest is easy

the clue that counted

by fred v gkkkne jr

                      a mystery of the triangle andthe blind alley
                      into which teeming trails to its solution led

    tell mcbbc i buy a big order if
  vv he sell me cheap

  schwartz shambled through the open
door of the shop the darkness of which
was intensified by the sudden change
from the bright sunlight without

  for a moment schwartz stood just
within the threshold of the basement
then becoming accustomed to the gloom
he cast his eyes around the room in
search of the strange man who made his
living by selling chocolate and choeolatc-
ircans to the cheap pedlers and candy-
makers in the neighborhood

  chocolatc bill for that was the only
name he was known by had arrived in
the triangle - so called by the police
from the fact that it is a three-sidcd
block-about a year before and opened
his shop with a stock of the commodity
that had given him his nickname which
he informed the curious he imported
from mexico

  business had prospered with him for
it was quickly noised around among
those interested that he sold his goods
cheaper than any one else in the city
still he contented himself with his base-
ment hovel in the slums of new  ork-
the front room serving as the store while
the doorless opening in the rear hung
with a piece of cheap print for a cur-
tain hid from the view of his customers
the little chamber he used as kitchen
sleeping and dining room

  as schwartzs eyes became accus-
tomed to the semidarkness he glanced
curiously around the room wondering
the while why the mexican had not
appeared in answer to his heavy tread
across the creaking floor then a
strange premonition came over him and
casting iris eyes around in an endeavor
to pierce the gloom he callcd  bill
bill i want to buy 

  there was no reply not a sound
penetrated the murky musty atmosphere

  in a far corner the jew could discern
what he at iirst glance thought was a
pile of rubbish a new courage seemed
to come over him and with a heavy
tread he strode toward it straining his
eyes as he neared the stuff

  standing over the heap of old rags
upon which he now saw the old mexican
stretched he emitted a harsh laugh

   asleep are you  a fine man for
business

  but the shopkeeper made no response
-he seemed to be in a deep slumber

  schwartz bent over him again

   i want to buy bill seizing the
mexicans shoulder roughly he added
 mebbe  buy- 

  but he proceeded no further jump-
ing back as if bitten by a poisonous rep-
tile he stood for a moment rooted to
the spot then with a scream of fright
dashed toward the open doorway

  pearing wildly through it he rushed
into the arms of a passing policeman
and seizing him in a grip of terror
pointed dumbly toward the room that
looked so dark and mysterious from the
hot sidewalk

  well wots bitin yez demanded
the policcman roughly

  in there schwartz pointed at
the door with a long lean dirty finger
that trembled with alarm

  the hardened officer quickly scented
trouble of some description facing
the fear-stricken pedler he demanded
gruffly  wots in there 

   bill-chocolate-

  but the policeman cut short the teeth-
chattering jew

   of course bills in there wot ails
ye comc wid me and well ec wots
wrong in the cellar

  no-no schwartz begged as the
officer seized his arm firmly  i see it
hes dead

  the officers jaw dropped for a brief
the clue that counted



second but be quickly regained his com-
posure

  bill-dead thin vcll surely come
wid me 

  holding bis club threateningly in one
hand his grip tightened upon the others
arm as he determinedly led the trem-
bling jewto the threshold then stooped
and rapped loudly upon the sidewalk a
sound well recognized by the inhabitants
of the quarter

  it brought cautiously peeping heads
from every window in the thickly popu-
lated neighborhood and caused those
upon the streets to stop and ntare fear-
fully nt the man who had taken this
means of summoning aid in the shape of
other members of the police forcc

ii

  tiir officer and schwartz were in-
stantly surrounded by a pushing jostling
crowd of rough looking men who
formed a circle about them

   wots dc guy did casey queried
an unknown youth bearing all the ear-
marks of the typical slum lough

 nothin that interests you finn

  turning quickly the policeman added
to a youngster who had wormed through
the gathered crowd lit back there
i very one of yez git back 

  at that moment the gathering in-
stinctively separated to make a path for
the two policeman who with drawn
clubs were running toward them at top
speed to the aid of the officer who still
held schwartz now at any moment lia-
ble to collapsc with fright upon the side-
walk

  whats up casey breathlessly
queried one of the newly arrived police-
men

   dont know yet but ill soon find
out was the reply  hang onto this 

  he pushed schwartz roughly into the
others arms  follow me into the cel-
lar he added

  the three officers headed toward the
door of the mexicans hovel the crowd
parting to make room for them and as
they disappeared within the gloom of the
basement forming themselves into a
solid mass around the door those nearest
it peered curiously into the shop

  with casey in the lead the policemen

mtrode to the center of the ill-smelling
room the one who had schwartz in cus-
tody being forced to push the terror-
stilcken man lefore him

  wheres bill casey demanded
facing the trembling jew

  tver-there was the almost in-
audible response

  following the direction indicated
casey walked to the farthest corner and
after bending over the dead mexican
quickly arose and walked hurriedly back
to the spot where the other officers and
their prisoner had remained

   git the wagon tom he ordered
  guess this jew may know somethin
worth while chocolate kill is dead

   do you think hes been murdered
was the calm query of the officer who
held schwartz

   dunno but well take this fellow
along till we do

  the policeman addressed as tom had
already wedged his way through the
crowd that now formed a solid mass
reaching from the door to the curb
and hurrying to the nearest police box
hastily sent in a summons for the patrol-
wagon

  with tears in his eyes and a face from
which all color had fled schwartz ques-
tioned brokenly  aint-done noth-
in you aint goin to arrest me are
you  

   oh yell git a bit of nttintion all
right casey answered coolly

  stepping to the corner of the room
again he bent over the dead mexican
and struck match after match as he
studied the man who looked as if sleep-
ing so natural was the position in which
he lay

  when he again straightened up and
slowly advanced to the side of the other
policeman there was a grim deepening
of the lines about caseys mouth

   another case for us frank he an-
nounced briefly  another mystery of
the triangle

  at that moment the clang of the patrol-
wagon announced its arrival and the
policeman who had summoned it made a
passage through the steadily increasing
gathering as the other two officers half
led half pushed schwartz toward the
conveyance and helped him in

  as the driver started the horses casey


the argosy

swung off the step to take up his duly
of watching the place until the arrival
of the coroncr

  as the wagon moved off schwartz
uttered a piercing cry of despair
nnd burying his face in his hands
moaned   aint arrested i aint-
done nothin 

iii

  i r was only a few hours later when
howard the detective who had been
placed upon the case arrived at the shop
of the murdered mexican the body
bad been removed a short time before
and was now at the morgue awaiting a
claimant

  it bad required no detailed autopsy
to decide the cause of the mans sudden
death the hasty examination by the
coroner bad revealed what casey had
already found-deep finger-prints upon
the mans throat proving conclusively
that an iron grip had suddenly fastened
around the mexicans windpipe stilling
any possibility of a call for help and
quickly cutting off the supply of air
without which no man can live

  schwartz had been taken to the near-
est police station and after a quizzing
by the sergeant which resulted in noth
ing new-the jew steadily maintaining
that he had gone to the shop to purchase
n supply of chocolate and found the
shopkeeper dead upon the floor-he was
hurried to the magistrates court for ar-
raignment and remanded to jail without
bail to await the outcome of the de-
tectives attempt to solve the mystery

    its glad to see ye  am   exclaimed
casey as the detective pushed through
the people who crowded close to the door
of tbe shop

  the news of the murder had traveled
like wildfire through the district bring
ing the curious to gape in at tbe open
door  its a nasty joint to hcv to spind
much time in

   so youre here on the job eh   was
the detectives response

   yis and durnjed glad ill be whin
im off it casey declared  whin ye
take charge of the case that lets me out

   come away from the door and tell
me all you know first see if theres a
key if there is shut and lock the
door

  the jxdiceman did as directed then
followed the detective to the barrels and
boxes that formed a counter at the rear
of the room

  the details as far as the officer knew
them were quickly imparted to howard
at the conclusion of which he made a
hasty examination of the place with the
aid of n dark lantern watched closely
by casey

  glancing hurriedly into corners and
finding nothing to which he attached
any importance he strode into the little
room at the rear

   know anybody that would know
this mexicans name or where he is
from howard suddenly demanded
facing the policeman

   sure i niver heard he had any other
name but chocolate bill

  a grunt was the detectives comment
and he continued his investigation but
nothing was in sight except dirt rags
and refuse

   the demised was not overly clean
howard muttered kicking at a pile of
old papers heaped in one corner

   wot can yc expect of a dirty
greaser   caay remarked

   only dirt it seems hallo heres
a letter 

  howard leaned over and picking it
up glanced at the paper with the aid of
his lantern

  can you read spanish casey hr
queried a twinkle in his eye the police-
man could not see

   ye know very well i cant came
the reply in injured tones

   hallo heres another i spanich
too and the same handwriting perhaps
they are clues-and perhaps not at
any rate they seem all we shall unearth
at present

  stepping toward the outer room casey
following closcly at his heels he added
 im going to find out what these con-
tain first ill make a closer examina-
tion later come on well lock the
place up ill take care of the key so
far there isnt much to work on

iv

  a short car ride brought the de-
tective to police headquarters with the
aid of an interpreter the letters were
the  ii k that counted



soon translated and revealed the correct
name of the murdered man a manuel
castro they were from his father and
couched in endearing terms both ac-
knowledging the receipt of fifty dollars
and hoping for the continuation of the
sons success iu business

  the result was a telegram despatched
to the police of the town from which the
letter was posted asking for information
of one manual castro and any details
regarding him that could be learned
and also informing them of his sudden
death

 while awaiting the reply howard
busied himself upon other matters that
demanded his attention expelling from
his mind temporarily the case that to
him meant little more than the ridding
of the world of an unnecessary character

  hut the telegram that awaited how-
ard upon his arrival at headquarters the
following morning causcd him to open
his eyes in astonishment and to read it
a second time then hasten to his chief
for a brief consultation

  as he entered tue room he extended
the telegram to the man liehind the desk
who glanced up inquiringly from the
papers he was perusing

 well howard his tone be-
trayed a trace of impatience

   heres the answer we wired for to
mexico yesterday in reference to that
murder iu the triangle sir the de-
tective said holding out the telegram

  without a word the chief took it and
read aloud in a low tone

    manuel cqstro well known here is
  very wealthy man sends fifty dollars
  month to invalid brother is big dealer
  in chocolate beans ww wrk address

   fast jersey street

  the chiefs brow was deeply knit as
he looked up into the detectives face
but for a moment he ditl not speak ap-
parently lost in thought

   any trares of opulencc around his
place he queried at length

   not unless dirt and rubbish consti-
tute it sir howard laughed

   very wealthy man the chief re-
peated glancing at the telegram  these
foreigners ideas of wealth arc sometimes
amusing

  then he added quickly  hut he may
be a miser still his sending fifty dol-
lars a mouth to mexico would be a
strange proceeding for a miser i think

  yes howard you go there and make
a thorough search thorough mind
you hunt for loose boards or hiding-
places in the walls then report to me

  howard bowed and left the room a
feeling of distaste uppermost in his mind
at the task before him

  he gathered in a brother detective
and the two made their way to the mexi
cans place and then began a systematic
hunt for anything that might prove a
due

  the task proved an unpleasant one
and more than once the two men railed
at their misfortune in being put on n
case that seemed so hopeless and in ad-
dition such a dirty one

  hag after bag of chocolatc-beans were
moved from one part of the room and
piled one upon the other iu a corner that
had first bean carefully inspected but
not a clue of any description was un-
earthed

  howard then fell to pawing over the
pile of rags upon which the murdered
man had been found while the other
carefully inspected the contents of a heap
of papers iu another corner

  wonder if this means anything
howard exclaimed bolding up in the
glare of his lantern a dirty frayed ruff
heres one - six - one - scrawled on
this rag

   dont know was the response
 but this surely does

  howard glanced questioningly at the
other and saw he was directing the rays
of his lantern upon a piece of paper

  what is it and howard hurried
over

   a receipt for one hundred and forty
dollars paid to m castro and which m
castro evidently forgot to sign and re-
turn

   well this is something anyway if
we find nothing else this may help us
ilenry krauser- south eleventh
avenue eh well mr krauser will
soon hear from us ill take charge
of this

  holding out tbc soiled cuff howard
added and this-one-six-one-may
be a telephone number well finish


the argosy

our search and then work upon these
two clues lerhapa-say jim our busi-
ness is strange sometimes we never
know what the smallest thing may lead
to eh

v

  howard paused for n moment gazing
up at the large gilt sign upon the win-
dows of the second floor

   krnuscr importer of laces he
muttered aloud then entered the build-
ing  and walking up one flight of stairs
opened the door of the establishment to
find himself in a well-furnished up-to-
date shop of the better class

  a short pompous man approached
him with the affable greeting  good
morning sir

   good morning howard replied
taking in the room with one sweep of
his eves  i wish to sec mr krauser

  the face of the other hardened for
an instant-his first thought had been
that his caller was a buyer-as be re-
plied  am mr krauser

  the officer was a man who did not
believe in formalities so he jumped di-
rectly into his subject

    called to see you regarding a cer-
tain mexican manuel astro by name
are you acquainted with him

   yes in a busines way was the re-
ply  i have ixjught goods in small
quantities from him but why do you
ask i 

  for answer howard displayed his
shield

  why has he got into trouble
krauser inquired almost fearfully

  it seems he did but whatever it
was it is ended now the detective an-
swered  in fact the mexican is
dead

   dead  the other repeated in sur-
prise

 to be more exact he was murdered

  yesterday morning howards tone
was calm almost cold

  murdered the lace dealer ex-
claimed in alarm  why-why this is
terrible why-only a few days ago-
let me sec it was last week  bought
quite a supply of drawn work from him
he had the best grade of that work i
have ever been able to find

 hut it isnt the quality of his laces

that  came to inquire alout howard
interrupted impatiently-the excitement
of the other annoyed him  i want to
learn all  can about him what do
you know  

   uut surely you do not connect me
in any way with this awful deed
krauser queried in alarm  why i
have never even been to his place of
business which  understand is located
in a vile part of the city tell me-
why am  brought into the case it
will ruin me-

  this is how i learned of you how-
ard broke in holding out the paper he
had found only a short time before

  the lace denier took it in his trem-
bling hands read it and then observed
 the receipt for the last lot of goods
 purchased from him  sent it by
messenger with the money but he did
not sign it saying he would send the
receipt later and lie is dead-it is ter-
rible i

  the detective was fast losing his pa
tience and as he took the paper again
he broke in with a plainly audible trace
of annoyance in his tone  the details
i care nothing for sir tell me in as
few words as possible what you know
of this man

  krauser was quickly calmed by the
authoritative manner of the other

   really  know so little-

   in the first place was he a man of
wealth  

   oh  hardly think so was the
quick response  in fact i think he
was a very poor man from different
things he told me he said he had to
sell his goods so cheaply that there was
hardly any profit in it at all and he
also told me he had an invalid brother
in mexico whom he supported

   then you would not consider him
a miser

  oh no not nt all he seemed too
well educated to stoop as low as that

i	could never understand the man he
was veil read upon all the topics of the
day spoke english and french as fluent-
ly as his own tongue yet was-well
dirty beyond description and the
hovel he lived in i understand-

   i knout all about that interrupted
howard  when did you last see
him  
the clue that counted



  about a week ago he brought me
a splendid line of new laces that hr had
just received from his native town
here are some of them

  krauser stepped toward the otber end
of the shop but the detectives quick re-
mark halted him

   i care nothing about them did
you see him after that time

   no i did not  hadnt enough
cash in the store to pay him-ho would
not take a check you know-

  the detectives eyes lighted up

   he would not take a check you
say 

   oh no only cash for him so i
told him i would send the money the
next day hut i forgot it entirely until
he called me on thw telephone-

   oh so he is familiar with the use
of the instrument

  howards brow was knit in deep
thought as he instinctively felt in his
pocket for the dirty cuff that he hoped
would prove a clue of some description

   yes lie seemed to be in fact he
bad called me a number of times upon
different matters as  said before he
called me saying he had not received
the money as i had promised and asked
if  couldnt send it right away as he
needed it very much i said i would
and despatched my loy with it he re-
turned without the receipt saying that
castro took the money anil thrust it into
his pocket then turned again to the two
men who were in the room with him
my boy waited and then he asked for
the receipt  hut castro said he would
send it and now you have it

  there is nothing more the de-
tective queried a far-away look in his
eyes

  no sir nothing

   i think i will sec this boy of yours
howard said where is he

   i do not know-in fact i havent
the slightest idea i discharged him last
saturday

   hut you have his address surely

   no i have not krauser replied
lowy  he came in one day looking
for work and as  needed a boy i hired
him

   and you trusted a hoy you didnt
know with one hundred and forty dollars
in cash to deliver to this castro

    	a

  the officera tone showed plainly his
surprise at such a proceeding

   yes-but i did not tell him the con-
tents of the envelope besides he may
be in any day  told him to call again
in a week or so as business might pick
up and  would then take himon again

i only discharged him because  had
nothing for him to do

  howards face showed plainly that tbe
entire ease was being rapidly revolved
in bis mind and the other forebore
breaking in upon his train of thought
suddenly the detective looked up and
reaching in his pocket took out a card
which he extended to krauser

   if the boy shows up again hold him
on some pretext or other and communi-
cate with me instantly he said  if

	do not hear from you by- well ill
call again soon

  without another word he turned
toward the door as he opened it the
lace dealer queried anxiously will
mv name be connected with this awful
affair 

   no not in any way was the reply
as howard made his way down stairs

  once again upon the street he paused
and glancing up toward the windows of
the lace shop murmured under his
breath  i wonder if the boy-no i
dont think he would be able to identify
the men he saw at the mexicans i
guess the next move is the cuff

  he felt in his pocket to make certain
he had it

   the greaser apparently was accus-
tomed to use the telephone ill follow
that number along these lines

  with a look of determination upon his
face he walked rapidly down the street

vi

  howard returned to headquarters
where he learned that a telegram had
been received from the mexican authori-
ties asking the police to hold castros
body for further instructions as to the
forwarding of same he also learned
that a coroners inquest upon the case
would be held the following day and
that schwartz although loudly and tear
fully proclaiming his innocence in tones
and wails that penetrated every cell in
the jail was still held in durance vile


the argosy

  as he was about to follow up the clue
of the number scrawled upon tlie cuff
an officer stepped up to him and tapping
him on the shoulder said  the chief
wants to see you

  howard went directly to his superiors
office and was greeted with the ques-
tion anything new on the triangle
case 

   nothing definite sir  found two
clues but have not been able to run them
down yet they-

   well tell me about them after you
have run them down im too busy at
present with facts to go into possibili-
ties i just thought  would tell you
that when this jew was searched they
found something like a hundred and
thirty-four dollars on him

   then i guess we had better hold
him for sure the detective broke out
triumphantly

  why whats new was the query
of the other

   only this sir i learned a short
while ago that the mexican castro re
celved one hundred and forty dollars a
few days ago in payment for some laoos
he sold and this poor poverty-stricken
jew having a sum so near it upon his
person may mean something

   yes it might

  	at any rate i shall follow that up as
rapidly as possible and will let you
know later

  a nod of approval from the chief an-
nounced that he considered the inter
view at an end and howard quickly
withdrew

  it was but the work of a moment to
communicate with the coroners office to
find the hour set for the inquest upon
the mexicans body and making a men-
tal note of it the detective hurried to the
offices of the telephone company deter-
mined to get a list of every telephone
line in the city that had one-six one ns
a designation as there were over thirty
branch offices in town he realized he had
quite n task before him

  reaching the main office some diffi-
culty was encountered before he arrived
at the department authorized to give the
information he desired  but at length he
was directed correctly and with pencil
and note book busied himself taking
down the names as given him

  at the conclusion of his task lie
thanked the clerk and walked out real-
izing that while the work before him
was not of a difficult character it would
undoubtedly be lengthy in the extreme

  hurrying back to headquarters fever-
ish to begin upon the job howard care-
fully studied each name he had written
down his first thought and hope-
was that one of them would be mexican

  hut strange to say every name
seemed distinctly american-there was
not one among tbc entire thirty odd that
even sounded foreign

   i guess ill have to take the whole
bunch in rotation and hope for luck
howard told himself  and in that way
i surely cannot miss any but i fear
my chances of success are small it
does not stand to reason that every one
in an office knows of the friends-or ac-
quaintances--of everv one else in that
office

   continuing to stare intently at the list
before him he suddenly exclaimed

   a detective agency eh mr frank-
lin ilaycs detective agency

  a smile broke over howards face

   i guess ill make that the first one
although i waste time iu calling up old
frank hayes i know his prices and
his rates are the highest in the city
oh well ill soon cut him off the list
picking up the telephone he called
impatiently  one six one -main

  for a moment lie continued his steady
gaze at the names he had noted in his
memorandum-book when a voicc at the
other end broke into his thoughts

  iiillo he exclaimed hayes
detective agency

   yes sir came the reply over the
wire

   is mr haves there 

  ill sec sir who is this

   howard-central office

   just a moment sir

   waste time the officer grumbled
aloud as lie waited impatiently for the
voicc of the man he was calling

   hallo howard whats on your
mind broke in upon the detective sud-
denly

   i only want to ask you if you ever
heard of a mexican named castro and
whom i want to locate

  for a full moment no reply came
til k cluk that countei



then he nearly sprang out of his chair
iti his excitement us the voice at the
other end of the wire announced  i
know of such a party yes but whats
wrong with him

  you know him howard demand
ed eagerly

   i think so but come up and ill
see you i dont like to talk over the
wire

    ill ik there as quickly as a street -
car will carry me good-by 

  dropping the instrument howard
seized his hat and dashed out of the
building as h stood upon the street
corner awaiting a car he asked himself
 now what the devil has that greaser
had to do with frank hayes

  the trip to the office of the detective
agency seemed unnecessarily long but
he was finally ushered into the presence
of the man who had been so strangely
connected with the triangle mystery

  after an exchange of greetings how-
ard asked  so you have had dealings
with manuel castro  mean the one
who lived in the triangle

   yes thats the man  guess was
the reply  not very choice neighbor
hood oh  

   you know of course that he was
murdered-

  murdered hayes looked at the
other as if unable to believe the an-
nouncement he had just heard

   yes he was found yesterday morn-
ing in his shop strangled  havent
seen anything of it in the papers so
guess they have not got hold of it yet

  murdered yesterday morning
hayes repeated as if in deep thought
 then that explains everything

  it was howards turn to repeat
 explains everything i what do you
mean  

   ill tell you and you can judge for
yourself this fellow castro whom i
have never seen called me on the tele-
phone some weeks ago and inquired if 
would undertake to find a certain person
for him  replied that that was a
branch of my business and he explained
that he was most desirous of locating a
fellow named iorter who hnd formerly
been a sergeant in the united states
army and had seen years of service on
the texas border

   as he could give me no clues at all

i	informed him that the cost might be
more than he would care to pay i
plainly heard him laugh  then he told
me to go ahead regardless of expense
and asked how much i wanted as ad
vaucc payment i said one thousand
dollars and he promptly told me it
would reach me in the morning together
with the details he had given me over
the phone

  and he sent it howard demand-
ed unable to give full credit to the story
he had just heard

   yes the next morning brought a
package by express and upon opening
it i found it contained exactly one thou-
sand dollars and a letter requesting me
to call for more when needed

   then lie did have money i  howard
exclaimed  he was a miser 

   as to that  know nothing but 
do know that after much search we
located mrs porter the mans mother
and she gave us her sons address he
is out of the army and living in arizona
where he lias accumulated quite some
wealth his mother thought he was
mining out there

   what do you suppose there was
about this soldier that would be of inter
est to the mexican

  howards tone was proof that he for
the moment was all at sea and flounder
ing around endeavoring to grasp some
scrap of evidence upon which to rest

   as to that i cannot say but  have
something more to tell two days ago
castro called me on the phone-that and
writing have been his only means of
communication with me and askecl me
to hurry my search  informed him
that i had completed it and the papers
would be ready that afternoon if he
would call for them ill admit  was
curious to see this strange man

  and he came howard broke in
not at all he asked me to send
them to him saving he could not leave
his place as every movement he made
was watched i thought this strange
but the questions  asked failed to bring
out anything further consequently i
mailed the documents to him night be-
fore last

   i-i- howard exclaimed in con
fusion  its a tangled case isnt it


the argosy

   rather was the cool reply as the
other man smiled grimly

    think ill make another search anil
see if those papers cannot be found in
his place  not-heavens that gives
two motives-the papers ami robbery
because i now feel certain this castro
hail money

   it appeared so to me the way he
handed it out

   li  cannot locate the papers you
sent him you have duplicate copies of
course 

   yes and they are at your disposal

  	thank you but before i call for
them ill try to find the originals
howard had already risen from his chair
anxious to get nt the work that increased
in mystery at every turn he made

   i am interested to know of your
progress let me hear of your success

   i will indeed good day

  as howard closed the door behind
him his brain was in a muddle events
had taken such sudden and unexpected
turns that for a moment he was nt a
loss just what step to tnkc

  walking along the street he gave full
vent to his feelings

   ill tear that old den inside out to
uncover those hayes papers if i cant
find them-well thats another motive
for the crimc

vii

  the remainder of the day howard
spent in a minute search of the two
rooms that constituted the murdered
mexicans store anil dwelling but there
seemed nothing in sight but dirt

  completely discouraged by the failure
he made direct for the agency to secure
copies of the papers that now seemed to
play an important part in the rapidly
deepening mystery

  hayes promptly handed over the doc-
uments and the officer headed for police
headquarters where he carefully read
the details of the search for the ex-sol-
dier and for which castro had willingly
paid a large sum of money

  at length he left the office and going
to bis home endeavored to shake oft tbe
feeling of depression that had secured
so firm a hold upon him as he realized
the slight chances he had of unraveling
the case that gathered tangles hourly

  the question that surged through his
brain continuously was  why was
castro so anxious to find porter hut
cogitate as he might there was no reply
forthcoming so he retired at an early
hour to secure the rest he needed to be
fresh and alert on the morrow

  the next day at headquarters he and
the chief were closeted for some time
going over in detail every point of the
case the outcome was that immediate-
ly after the coroners jury adjourned
howard was to take the first train west
locate this ex-soldier and find out all ho
could from that quarter

   you know your game howard the
chief remarked  i dont need to tell
you how to proceed get back as quick-
ly as possible ill see that this jew is
held until we are certain of his inno-
cence

  the detective left his superior officcr
feeling in a brighter mood than he had
for some hours and shortly afterward
he was at the coroners inquest relating
in detail all he knew of the case the
result was that schwartz was led back to
jail tearing his hair and leating his
breast and calling wildly for the gods to
intervene and prove his innoccncc

  a hurried trip to his home was how-
ards next move to pack his bag and an
hour later found him comfortably seated
in an overland train bound for arizona
the long tiresome trip was at last over
and with a feeling of relief he stepped
from the train and walked along the
rough platform toward the station at the
other end

  a glance in the direction of the town
showed rows and rows of single un-
paintcd one-story buildings grouped in-
discriminately behind which stretched
the level prairie ending at the base of
the mountains plainly discernible in the
distance

  approaching the station howard
faced the rough unkempt men who were
gazing curiously at him he walked up
to them and in his most devil-may-care
tone queried  any of you men know
a fellow here by the name of porter

  for a moment no one replied then
a heavily bearded man advanced a step
or two and after staring critically at
the man before him answered the ques-
tion with an inquiry of his own
the clue that counted



    wots he look like  

   never saw him myself howard
replied quickly  only know hi name

   wal stranger folks round hero aint
overly much on names yc know least-
wise in this town they aint

   well ill tay around a few days
the detective remarked  perhaps ill
find him whats the best hotel in
town  

   the lest  the spokesman retorted
 they aint no best here stranger
theyre all good

    see the detective was a trifle
taken back at the sudden reply  well
 hope ill see you boys again before i
leave

  with a pleasant nod howard turned
toward the scattered buildings and see
ing a sign before him that proclaimed
the structure upon which it was fastened
to be a hotel he headed directly for it

  as he entered he was pleased to note
that the interior was cleaner than the ex-
terior  and approaching the barkeeper-
the barroom also served as an office--
he announced im going to be in
town for a few days can i secure ac-
commodations here

   sure and the lest in uncas which
is sayin a good deal just wait a mo-
ment till the boss returns and hell show
ye to a room  dont dare leave the
bar alone if i did some one would
like as not come in and walk olt with
it room and all have somethin

   thanks i dont mind

  howard had all he could do to prc
vent his face betraying the effects the
drink had upon his system to him it
seemed little more than rank poison it
was whisky of the cheapest kind- and
yet ranked as first-class stuff in that
town

  stranger here aint ye the bar
keeper queried smacking his lips as lie
gulped down the large portion he had
poured out for himself

   yes the detective replied swal-
lowing hard in an effort to wash down
the vile liquor that seemed to contract
the cords of his throat  am on my
way to the coast and stopped off here to
see an old friend who lived here the
last i heard of him porters his name
do you know him i believe he is quite
a wealthy miner

   dont know any miner by that name
in fact never heard the name here that
i kin remember

  the detectives face fell and he could
not conceal his disappointment at this
second blow to his hopes

   thats strange i thought every
one here would know him

   guess youll find hes picked up a
new name since he landed here stranger
most all of em do ye know

    is that so 

   yes was the drawled response

  for a moment neither spoke then the
barkeeper-broke the silence

   now come to think of it yere the
second person whats been inquirin
bout that name

  howard was instantly all attention

   yes the other continued thought
fully  im sure that was the name but
 wouldnt le so certain either least-
wise it runs in my mind it was porter

  and did lie find him the oflker
queried anxiously

   yes i blieve the old general was
the man he was looking for ns i remcm-
her bearin one of the boys remark but
bein ax the fellow what was lookin for
him was a greaser none of the boys was
particular bout minglin with him

  howard could not speak for a mo-
ment discoveries were coming in
such rapid succession he feared he
would lose one before he had properly
grasped it

   you say it was a greaser who was
looking for him  

   sure and a darned ugly lookin cuss
he was too

   but this man you call general-

   i believe they all him that because
he was in the army once thats the
only name hes known by round here
he lives in a hut at the end of the street
with a hitlf breed woman what he mar-
ried but lie aint been sober for near
a month i guess drunk all the time
and imagines hes a general of a large
army its funny to see him when he
gets carryin on

  i wonder if hes at home now
howard questioned

   shouldnt wonder if he was cause
he went out in that direction only bout
half an hour ago

  ill just take a stroll out that way


the argosy

ill leave my bag here and be back pres-
ently which house is it and how do
i get to it 

  jest keep goin to the end of this
street and ask anybody there where the
general lives they all know him

   all right ill try to find him

  taking from his pocket a handful of
cigars the detective threw them upon
the bar

   have some smokes

   dont mind if i do

  howard stepped to the open door and
pointed up the street

   this way eh  

   yes straight ahead ill mind your
bag till you git back

viii

  howard picked his way carefully
along the dirty dusty highway that
served as a street glancing interestedly
from one side to the other at the huts
and shanties that lined it

  the detective was thankful the town
did not cover any more area than it did 
and as the open lots between the build-
ings became more frequent a look ahead
showed him the one be sought

  as lie neared it a huge half-starved
dog ambled out toward him the offi-
cer mopped his facc with his handker-
chief and patted the dogs head as he
mused  doesnt look like my idea of
what a wealthy miners habitation should
be

  with the dog at his heels sniffing sus-
piciously he walked determinedly to the
open door of the shack and rapped nois-
ily upon it an unkempt woman an-
swered the summons

  is the general at home howard
queried

   yes he is the woman snapped
 do ye want to see him 

   if you please the detective re-
turned in his most affable tone

  without another word the woman
disappeared within the hut again and
after a brief wait shuffling footsteps an-
nounced the approach of the man the
officer had comc so many miles to inter-
view

  as he came in sight howard felt cer-
tain that just at the moment when suc-
cess seemed at hand failure had come

instead hecause this dirty shiftless
looking fellow surely was not the man
he wished to find hut he quickly
threw oft his disappointment

   iiow do you do general was his
pleasant greeting

   wal what do ye want was the
snarled inquiry

 i want to talk to you a moment
howard pretended not to notice the
others disagreeable manner drawing
a cigar from his pocket lie extended it
calniiv

   will you smoke 

  for a moment the man gazed at the
dctcctlve steadily with his beady eyes
then almost snatched the cigar from his
hand howard lit one himself and
then as he blew a cloud of smoke into
the air observed  you never saw serv-
ice on the texas border did you

  the little beady eyes into which the
visitor stared so unwaveringly dropped
anil then came the retort  mebbc i
did-and mebbe  didnt

  the detective realized that to gain the
information desired he must be diplo-
matic so not appearing to notice the
answer lie went on  i am trying to
locate a fellow who spent considerable
time there  is name is orter

  the other gave a visible start

   say stranger he began in a more
pleasant tone  ye aint a greaser are
ye

   good heavens man do i look like
one howard laughed

   no ye dont

  then why do you ask

    h - because i thought yc might
be then he added quickly  every-
body down here is suspicious of greas-
ers

  the detective smiled reassuringly

    you say this feller yer lookin for is
named porter whats his first name

   let - me - see howard was
caught this time as he did not remember
having heard it  i cannot recall it
just at the moment but i understand
lie is a wealthy miner in this town

  the other sniffed harshly

   if you kin find a wealthy person in
this whole layout miner or anything
else youll do moren even the natives
here kin do

  a grim laugh followed but was cut
till clue that counted

-

short by a look of suspicion ns the man
added  who told ye he was a wealthy
miner 

   ilis mother howard responded
 she-

  hut he was cut short hy the actions
of the man who nervously seized his arm
as he entreated tell me stranger
have ve seen her how is she 

  before the detective could reply a
harsh female voice called from within
the cabin general come here

  the man glanced around fearfully for
a second  then his hands dropped to his
side and he slunk sheepishly within the
cabin without a word leaving howard
standing on the doorstep gazing won
deringly after him

  for some moments the detective waited
for his return unable to account for the
sudden action then he heard some one
walking coward him at that moment
the woman whom he had lirst encoun-
tered and whom he surmised was the
generals wife appeared in the doorway

   the general says he dont know no
one by the name of porter and that ends
it she snapped decisively

ix

  howard was so taken aback by the
unexpected closing of his interview that
for a moment he did not reply but stared
wonderingly at the woman before him
undecided just what to do

   but t wish to talk some more with
your husband madam he remarked
 we have not finished our conversation

   i finished it for ye stranger she
asserted threateningly if ye know
when vcre well off yell git

  but i-

  carlo the woman called

  at the sound of his name the huge
brute leaped to his feet and with a
bound was ot her side if  say the
word this dogll muss ye some arc yc
goin  

  howard realized he was in a tight
place but knew too that if lie gave in
now the chances were that his trip would
end in utter failure these thoughts
flashed through his mind in less than a
second and in less than another he had
whipped out his revolver anti had it
leveled at the dogs head

  without taking his eyes from the ani-
mal lie remarked coolly  if you speak
to him hes a goner

  at that instant the generals voice was
heard as he roughly commanded git
out of my way im goin to be a man
again

  howard looked up to sec the general
push his wife aside

  git out of here carlo come
stranger lets take a walk put up yer
gun-theyre bad things to flash in this
country and have been the cause of a
certain depopulation of the town yer
american and so am i come

  following his lead and unable to
fathom the new turn of events the de-
tective accompanied the man ns they
slowly walked out toward the open
prairie but howard was suspicious
and instead of replacing his revolver on
his hip put it in the side-pocket of his
coat keeping his hand on the trigger so
that at the first sign of trouble he could
shoot through the garment

  as they approached a little grassy
knoll the general said slowly  lets
sit down here-and talk

  he threw himsdf full length upon the
grass and howard seated himself beside
him but for a moment neither spoke

  suddenly the general sat up a pecul-
iar expression stamped on his face

  stranger im porter i  was the an-
nouncement that almost startled the de-
tective so abrupt and unexpected was it

  before he could reply the other went
on hoarsely and im tired of this life
-tired of bein a dog- i want to be a
man and whats more im goin to be
 say im goin to be 

  howard noted the fierce look in the
mans eyes but refrained from speaking
thinking it better to let him tell his story
in his own way

  seems a lifetime to me since i came
out to this country that god forgot cen-
turies ago but im goin back now
shes always talked it out of me before
but now im goin an if she dont want
to come she can stay

  his voicc softened as lie continued
shes got injun blood in her veins
and cant see nothin cept the west but
im an easterner and when ye spoke of
havin seen my poor old mother- well
i jest made up my mind then and there


tiie argosy

and to the devil with that greasers
money ill take no more of it

  that greascrs money howard re
pcated

   yes for six years hes bought me
but lie cant do it no more theres a
payment due in u few days but hell git
it back im through with him 

  the officer could hardly contain him-
self no wild was his curiosity to ques-
tion he felt certain this man held the
solution to the castro murder just in
what way he could not decide

  but he feared to question realizing
that the other would tell more if allowed
to go his own gait

  a smile spread over porters hardened
face

    yes ill see my old mother in a few
days i cant hardly realize it stranger
many and many a night ive dreamed
about it-seen her sittin in her old chair
readin just as she used to when i was
a young feller and livin home-that was
before i joined the army-and then
shed look over her glasses at me for a
moment and smile and then come across
to me and place her dear old arms round
my neck and tell me just what a comfort
i was to her in her old age

  he paused a moment then his face
hardened again and he angrily broke
out  but it was only a dream and i
realized i was as far away from her as
i ever was

  his head sank upon his chest for a
moment howard counting the seconds
before he would speak of the mystery
that he hoped would soon be unraveled
suddenly porter sat up erect

   stranger have ye seen my mother

   no  have not i am orry to say
was the quick response

  then ye dont know her do ye i
wonder how she is

  his face took on a thoughtful look

   i wonder if shes aged much
she- he paused and questioned in a
suspicious voice  look here ye aint
told me who you arc

  me oh my name is howard
the detective pressed his finger lightly
upon the trigger of the revolver that
was concealed in his pocket fearing
some outbreak as he announced calmly
 officer howard of the detective bu-
reau of new york city

   porters face broke into a smile

   i dunno what ye want me for but
im ycr willin prisoner take me back
to new york as quick as ye want to-
the sooner the better id sooner go
back there dead than remain here any
longer alive

   but i am not here to arrest you
howard quickly corrected him  i
only want some information that  think
perhaps you can give me

   if its about estario you can get it
from me all right the other announced
 liut honest im sorry ye dont want
to arrest me and take me back stranger
im sure disappointed

   but who is this estario queried
the detective almost fearfully scenting
some new complication in the name that
was distinctly mexican

  him an oath escaped through
porters gritted teeth  hes the greaser
thats kept me in this nun-baked whisky-
flooded country till i almost forgot
there was civilized cities cast of them
mountins yonder

x

  fok some moments howard refrained
from breaking the reverie into which
porter had fallen at length he repeat-
ed   who is this estario vou spoke
of

   the other raised his head slowly

   yc know who  thought ye was whet
ve first came i thought ye was one of
his agents there was one snoopin
round a few weeks ago to see i suppose
if i still looked healthy how that man
would like to see me kick the bucket
cause then id take his secret with tne
thcys an old savin  dead men tell no
tales and i suppose thats what lies
always thinkin when he thinks of me

    but this secret 

    is jest what im goin to tell ye 
kin do so now and not be dishonorable
ye see lie pays me in advance to keep
my mouth shut and as his last quarters
payment is bout up i kin tell yc and
not be betrayin any trust cause hell
git his next payment back by the follow-
ing mail

    you can trust me i assure you

  porter ruefully threw away the stump
of the cigar lie had so much enjoyed
te cia e that counted



   vo havent got another round have
ye he asked half hesitatingly

    surely have howard replied
quickly and fumbling in his pocket
drew out a good one and handed it to
porter who bit off the end and striking
a match was soon blowing clouds of
smoke into the air

   its six years since i smoked anything
as good as this wc dont git em like
this out here

  lie settled back comfortably upon the
grass

   bout six years ago he went on
 jest before my term of enlistment in
the army expired-and i had served
three terms-n greaser came to me one
day ami asked me if id like to make
enough money to always live in comfort
without working a stroke  was gettiil
tired of army life in that wild country
where any moment yere liable to get
shot up by injuns or greasers and
theyre both bud when they git a goin
naturally i was open to any suggestions
cornin my way if you had been there
ye could understand my feelins better

   i think i can realize them how-
ard remarked feverish for what was to
come

   no ye cant-ye got to be there and
go through the life fore ye can porter
asserted positively  hut about this
greaser-ill cut out all the details and
get down to the actual facts this
estario was a power in the mexican gov-
ernment and a man worth barrels of
money well he had done something
the others in the government didnt like
-durncd if i know what it was-and
they clapped him into jail

  jail life wasnt exactly to his likin
so he havin plenty of money got some
men together and they formed a band
to help him escape from prison and
wanted me to get him across the border
and into the states well i did curses
upon the white-livered cuss 

 why howard regretted having
spoken the moment the words had es-
caped his lips

 why porter almost shrieked
 because it leaked out soon after hat
i hail sneaked some worthless greaser
acros the line and there wasnt no place
in the army for me after that when
my time was up  was mighty glad to

sneak out of the barracks i couldnt
do nothin but come out here as he had
told me to cause the only thing i knew
about was army life and i was done
with that that fiend went to new
vork and i suppose is there yet least-
wise i get my money in an envelope
that is mailed there but i get no more
im goin east myself and it my woman
wont come she kin stay here

   but tell me one thing do you sup-
pose the mexican government is still
after this estario  

   dont ye know a greaser never for-
gets but waits his time theyll git
him vet you wait and see

   but i wonder-

   but come to think on it stranger
porter interrupted  ye aint told me
why ye come way out here to see me i
got so interested in my own story i clean
forgot that mebbc ye had one of your
own too

   have howard replied and i
want your help

  eire away was the others calm
order  im in fer doin anything 
can fer you

  howard leaned a trifle closer

   well in the first place do you know
a mexican named castro

  porter gave vent to a loud guffaw

   say stranger he snid when his
mirth had somewhat subsided wposc
i asked if ye knew a feller named smith
in the united states yed laugh hearty
wouldnt ye well when i tell you
theres more castros in mexico than
there is smiths browns or joneses in
the whole united states yc can realize
why i laughed

   but this fellows name is manuel
castro the detective interposed with
just a tinge of annoyance in his tone

   aint much bettrr stranger im
sorry to say but come to think on it

the argosy

had returned to porters face  he
wanted to find you and a detective
agency had been employed by him to
locate you they found your mother
nnd she told where you were the day
after the agency sent their report to this
castro he was discovered in his shbp
strangled to death and the papers can-
not hr found thinking perhaps you
might be able to throw some light upon
the case-how finding you would inter
rst this mexican-i came out here ex-
pressly to see if you could help u trace
liia assassin

  for a moment porter did not reply
when at last he looked up into how-
ards face there was a decided softening
of his features  stranger lie said
 ive got an idea im pretty well ac-
quainted with greasers and their habits
and i wouldnt be surprised if i might
know whos at the bottom of this im
goin hack fast with ye if yell travel
with a tramp like me ive got a little
money saved up and my livin here is
ended im goin to start out and cam
another quick and my poor old
mother is waitin for me at th other end
of the railroad

  he quickly sprang to his feet
 stranger he exclaimed  im more
glad than i can tell ye when i think
of what yer call to-day has done for me
come on home- i want to tell the
woman

xi

  as the two men approached porters
hut for it was little more they snw his
wife seated on the doorstep as she
caught sight of them she hurriedly rose
and was in the act of going inside when
her husband called marty wait a
minute

  the woman turned and stood unde-
cided and as the men reached her por-
ter said marty were goin to leave
uncas

  where we goin she asked sim-
ply

   to new york well sec my
mother he replied quickly

  a smile broke over her face and she
cxclaimcd  good i i never had a
mother now i have yours general

   all right go in and pack up what

ye want to take with ye porter drawled
 well go in the mornin on the early
train

  but what will you do about
your house here-and your household
goods the detective queried casting
his eyes toward the open door

   that i  porter jerked his head to-
ward the building then laughed con-
temptuously  why leave it for some
poor devil theyll be one along to lay
claim to it and hring his worthless body
in it and call it home just as i did near
six years ago i dunno who claimed it
before  did and care a durned sight
less who does after me well meet ye
nt the station in the mornin for the
east-bound that is if ye dont object
to travelin with two people rigged up
as wc will be ye see clothes aint of
no account out here but as soon as we
git to a decent town well both git fitted
out so we wont shame ye any longer
than wc have to

   pshaw you talk foolishly the de-
tective interposed at the snme time he
could not help but wonder what his
traveling companions would look like
when they boarded the train together the
next morning

   wal mebbe i do and mcbbc i dont
but remember i aint always been what

i	look like now i had pride myself
once and its cornin back to me right
now in great big chunks

  howard smiled to himself the ear-
nestness of this man was a new thing to
him-something heahad never witnessed
before and as he turned to go lie re
marked you will be busy getting
your things together to-day so ill not
disturb you ngain ill meet you at the
train to-morrow

   yes well be there there was a
thoughtful look in his eyes as he added
 i cant realize im goin to see my
mother so soon hut ive got another
idea about goin to new york mebbe

	can help ye about this castros sudden
demise

   you can  howard exclaimed in
surprise in what way

   well  know greasers better than
ye do and ive got an idea

   what is it   the officer inquired
eagerly cant you tell me

   not now tranger anyway its
the clue that counted

only an idea hut ill tell ye on the
train to-morrow ive got to git busy
now dont tell any of the boys the
generals lcavin town i want to jest
slip out quiet like

  turning toward the door he added
 so long till to-morrow dont miss
the train

xii

  long before train-time howard was
nervously walking up and down the sta-
tion platform his eyes glancing contin-
ually in the direction from which porter
would come ami as the minutes passed
and he did not appear his fear that the
man had changcd his mind overnight in-
creased to such an extent that he was on
the point of making another visit to his
shack when ho saw the couple hurrying
toward him

  as they drew near he was agreeably
surprisd at the appearance of both
porter had shaved and they showed the
effects of a goodly application of soap
and water and although their clothes
were not of the latest cut they looked
very presentable

  thought you had changcd your
mind the detective remarked

   not much i  porter exclaimed drop-
ping his old satchcl  ive got to git
our tickets

  one of the men who had comc down
to the station to see the train come iu-

one of the few excitements that ever
stirred the town- sauntered up to por-
ter

   where yc goin general  he in-
quired

   me and the womans goin to take a
little trip he replied hurrying on down
the platform

  the heavy train rumbled in and the
little party clambered aboard the hang-
ers-on upon the platform watching them
curiously mrs porter stared wonder
ingly around the car and finding two
empty scats together howard motioned
her to one of them

  	the general and i will take this

one he remarked  wc have some-
thing to talk over

  a frightened look came into her eyes
and her lips trembled a triile as she
queried you wont leave me

  howard hastened to reassure her

   oh no well be right here

  at this she smiled and settled herself
back in the seat

   well general youve something to
tell me the detective began

   yes i have the other slowly
drawled youre a detective and
when i git to new york im goin to
be one too that is on one case any-
way im goin to hunt estario he
might be able to tell me something about
this castro who evidently was in some
ones way upon this earth

   do you think-

   thats all it is so far porter inter-
rupted  only thinkin - but mebbe

some day itll be knowin

   i dont think i understand you
howard remarked

   well i only know this much when
estario first skipped the mexican au-
thorities offered ten thousand dollars re-
ward for his capture and they aint
people what forgets a thing theyll
never be satisfied till hes been caught
and ive got an idea hes somewhere in
new york if he is and i can find him
that ten thousand would go a long way
toward makin me an the woman com-
fortable for the rest of our lives our
wants aint extravagant ye know

   hut his capture doesnt help me in
my search the detective interposed

   well im not so sure of that the
other returned calmly  ive been do-
in a heap of thinkin since yesterday and
considerin what ye told me about this
castro wantin to find me-well he may
be after that reward and estario may
have got wind of it and thought his
presence upon this earth rather objec-
tionable

   hy jove howard exclaimed ex-
citedly  perhaps youre right 

xiii

  the long journey was a severe ordeal
to howard so anxious was he to get to
new york and work upon the clue por-
ter had given him

  a brief stop was made in st louis
where the general-foi as such the de-
tective continued to address him-and
his wife had purchased a complete outfit

  seems sorter homelike i porter ex-
claimed glancing around interestedly


the argosy

when they finally alighted at the grand
central station turning to his wife
he added marty this beats uncas
eh  

  but she did not reply and the three
walked rapidly out to forty-second
street

  suddenly porter queried anxiously
 i say stranger ye aint forgot my
mothers address have yc

  a look of consternation spread over
the detectives face

   why i never had it he replied
then his tone changed to one of cheer-
fulness as he added  but i can get it
easily enough

  how porters spirits had sunk
nearly to the point of despair

   ill tell you what we are going to
do the detective went on  of
course ive got to report to the chief as
soon as possible well go down there
together and as soon as ive seen him
ill phone to the detective agency that
has your mothers address i could do
it now  but it will take a few minutes
and i must get to headquarters comc
on

  reaching their destination howard
said now im going to report and
you wait here on the sidewalk ill be
back in a moment

   dont forget to get my mothers ad
dress porter called after him

   i wont was the reply

  howards interview with the chief
certainly showed conclusively that the
time was not ripe to have a medal pinned
on his coat for cleverness perhaps it
was because the chief was not in a par-
ticularly pleasant mood owing to a
much - wanted crook having slipped
through the fingers of one of his men
an incident the newspaper had got hold
of and for which he was criticized se-
verely

   well i dont care how you get your
man but get him   was the comment
after howard had briefly related his ex-
periences of the last few days

    ye sir the officer replied rising
from his chair and realizing that the
conference was over

  oh howard just a moment the
other called as the detective was leaving
the office

  the chief fumbled among the papers

on his desk  heres a wire i received
this morning from the mexican govern-
ment it may have something to do with
this case

  howard took it and slowly read the
message it contained

  special agent of government tn route
  to new york please ive him any help

 you can	m dbxtron

   make anything out of it the chief
queried as howard finished the perusal

   i dont know sir

   well report here to-morrow morn-
ing anyway he ought to be here by
that time and as your acquaintance ith
these people has been rather extensive in
the past few days ill let you help him
thats all

   very well sir the detective as-
sented and quickly took his departure

  in the outer room he asked the man
at the desk are they still holding
that jew on the triangle mystery 

   sure and a merry life hes making
for the others in the jail hes got em
all nearly crazy with his yelling and
bawling his trial isnt set as yet

  without a comment howard went to
the telephone booth and was soon talk-
ing to franklin hayes who was able
to give him porters mothers address
jotting it down in his note-book the de-
tcctivc walked slowjy and disconsolately
out of the building and advanced to
where the couple awaited his coming

  as porter caught sight of him he
rushed up a strange light in his eyes

 why yc been so durned long
they-

   i hurried as quickly as  could
howard hastened to interrupt  ive
got your mothers address

   well id rather yed been out here
than gettin that the other angrily re-
turned  while i was standing here a
dirty lookin greaser come strollin by
and kept lookin into my face until he
hadpassed in lessn a minute he come
by again with another greaser they
both stared again an then stood upon
the corner there watchin us they
hustled around it when they seen you
cornin

  howard quickly turned toward the
corner indicated there was no one
there
the clue that counted



   do you think 

    aint th inkin nothin the other
broke in roughly  i know theyre up
to some deviltry

  	then why didnt you stop them-
hold them till  came

   say stranger  aint no policeman
the other sneered

   come let us see if wc con trace
them

  howard turned and ran toward the
corner porter and his wife hurrying
after him

  when he reached it he gazed eagerly
up and down the street-there was no
sign of what he wanted in sight

xiv

   cant you describe them how-
ard pleaded hopelessly

   say stranger can ye describe an
injun the other laughed of
course not cause they all look alike
well its the same with greasers

   then there is nothing we can do
the dctective replied

   nothin at all ye werent here and
thats nil there is to it im goin to sec
mother if yell give me the address

  howard was trying to think of some
plan of action and replied absently
 ill go as far as the door to make sure
you dont get lost

  the three boarded a street-car and
were soon on the up-town journey but

il	was not a jovial party howard was
busy with his own thoughts of the failure
that stared him in the face while the
other two were staring open-eyed at the
sights around them

  for some blocks this continued when
as the car stopped to take on more pas-
sengers lorter seized the detectives arm
in a grip of steel pointing to a man
who had just crossed the street lit whis-
pered theres one of the cusses

  howard was on his feet in an instant
with his eyes riveted on the man indi-
cated who was slowly sauntering down
the side-street he fumbled in his pocket 
and ripping out the paper in his note
book upon which he had written por-
ters mothers address he exclaimed
 go up there any one will direct you
ill follow this man and will call on
you later

  the car had alreadygathered speed
but howard rushed to the rear platform
sprang off walked rapidly and was soon
back at the corner from which he could
see bin man only half a block away

  then followed a brief time of shad-
ow ing the man led the detective to
the nearest subway station boarded an
up-town train and got out at the sev-
enty second street station howard
never losing sight of him for a second

  walking to seventy-pourth street he
entered a large pretentious house
through the basement door and howard
took up his post of watching for him

  a long wait of two hours passed be-
fore any one emerged when suddenly the
same man hurried out and reaching the
sidewalk glanced fearfully up and down
the street then started again at a rapid
pace in the direction of the subway

  the detective hurried across the street
after him and at the sound of the quick
footsteps the stranger turned and see-
ing howard so close to him broke into
a run

   halt or ill shoot  howard called

  the man glanced over his shoulder
as the detective drew his revolver then
came to an abrupt stop

  what do you mean sir he de-
manded in english when howard
reached his side

    mean you will comc with me the
dctective panted

  the other shrugged his shoulders

   a fine country where a man cannot
even run for a car very well i come

  without further conversation the of-
ficer let his prisoner to the police station
only a few blocks away

  while the sergeant at the desk was
making the entry of the arrest-lie put
the fellow down as a suspicious charac-
ter according to howards instructions
- the prisoner queried  i can furnish
bail

   well thats your affair the ser-
geant answered

  all right i write a message and
you deliver it for me eh

  yes ill do it all right

  the prisoner was taken to a cell and
being given some paper hastily scrawled
a note in spanish directing that it be
sent to the house in seventy sccond
street which he had just left


the argosy

   hold hat note howard ordered
 vvcil deliver it later i want you to
get in touch with another man before
this fellow is bailed out im not taking
any chances of losing a big capture
send a man to this address- he was
rapidly turning the pages of his note-
book  confound it  havent got it 

  he stared blankly at the policeman
then n smile broke over his face  but
i can get it after all

  taking the pfiono he was soon talking
again to franklin hayes and for the
second time was noting mrs porters
address in his hook as he hung up the
receiver the bell rang violently

  the sergeant answered it howard
hurrying out at the door before he had
gone many feet a policeman called him
back

   headquarters wants you on the
phone

  what next i wonder howard
muttered as he picked up the receiver

  the man at the other end informed
him he had been told to call up every
police station asking them to tell de-
tective howard if he camc in that head-
quarters wanted him

  what for he demanded

   wait a moment and ill see if i can
find out was thr answer

  the officer counted the scconds real-
izing that every one of them might be
precious just at present

  hallo came over the phone
 wc just received word from a man
named krauser that he wants to sec you
immediately

  all right the detective replied

  turning to the sergeant he fumed
 now how can a person be in two
places at once i know what ill do-
ill phone him

  hastily looking up krausers telephone
number the connection was quickly es-
tablished

   hallo mr krauser he called
 this is howard i irclieve you called
me

   yes that boy of mine came in a
short while ago and is here now do
you want to sec him  

   ask him what the two men he saw
in castros shop looked like ask him
if he thinks they wore mexicans

  after a few seconds delay the reply

  came back  no lie says they were
jews will you be right down

  no howard snapped i dont
want to see him now good-by 

xv

  without another word howard
strode from the police station and
springing upon a car was soon walking
across ninety-seventh street in the di-
rection of the east river-mrs porter
lived far over on the east side

  at last he reached the house and a
climb of two flights brought him to mrs
porters apartment

  in answer to his ring porter himself
came to the door

   come in stranger  he exclaimed
his face wreathed in smiles

   not now general howard remon-
strated  i want you to come with me
to the police station ive arrested that
greaser

  jehosephat do you know i clean
forgot about him  was so glad to see
mother sure ill come and durned
glad to do so wait till i get my hat

  in a moment he was ready and to-
gether the two men hurried to the policc
station as they entered howard or
dered  sergeant now you can send
that letter  told you to hold

  he and porter sauntered down tlie
corridor to the cell where the mexican
was confined and as they stood before
it porter announced positively yes
thats one of the cusses

  the prisoner made no comment but
turned his back upon them for some
moments howard and porter endeav-
ored to draw the man into conversation
but to no avail-the man was as one
stricken dumb

   theres no use trying him now gen-
eral the detective asserted  i think
hell be more willing to talk at head-
quarters there was a peculiar em-
phasis to his tone  theyve a way of
making a man talk there he added

  as they turned from the cell heavy
footsteps and raised voices could be
heard approaching them from the other
end of the corridor

   what is the meaning of this out-
rage an angry voice demanded

howard and porter stepped to one
the clue that counted



bide to allow the enraged person and the
policeman who accompanied him to pass

  the detective felt a grip upon his arm
and nt the same instant porter sprang in
front of the angry man  well mr
estario you didnt expect to find me
here did you   he said

  the person addressed started back as
if shot but as quickly regained his com-
posure

    do not understand you my man
what do you mean 

   you always was a cool cuss par-
ticularly when i was escortin you across
the border my names sergeant por-
ter  

  but the other smiled blandly

   i must say you have the advantage
of me tny dear sir i nevermet you be-
fore

   probably not that you wish to re-
member porters temper was rising
rapidly  but  remember i remem-
ber how you exiled me for six long years
away from everybody i knew just for
the sake- of a few dollars if i had
wanted to be dishonorable id have
skipped after j got the first payment
but its my turn now

  looking at howard he added the
mexican government wants him and
wants him bad so bad theyre willin
to give ten thousand dollars for him
lock him up 

  the mexicans calmness suddenly left
him  and with a cry of rage he sprang
at porter hut howard was quicker
and sent him sprawling upon the floor
with a heavy blow in the face

  as he fell a glistening object rattled
noisily upon the stone pavement it was
a small dagger

  with no attempt at gentleness the
man was thrust into a cell and the door
clanged noisily after him

   pretty close call general howard
observed

  thats nothin the other sniffed

   well lets go down to headquarters
and report howard added  and then
ill communicate with mexico if that
reward still holds good to-day has been
a profitable one for you

  as the two men entered headquarters
building a short time later a swarthy in-
dividual passed them and one of the
men standing around called  say

howard that mans well in with the
chief for some time and the chiefs been
inquiring if you were around

  another policeman had already run
after the stranger and the speaker con-
tinued we called up seventy-sixth
street station where we knew you were
a little while ago and they said you had
left

  as the man who had gone after the
stranger returned with him and escorted
him to the chiefs office howard fol-
lowed first telling porter wait here
till i come out

  the chief glanced up as the two men
entered

  howard he announced this is
mr sanchez head of the mexican secret
scrvicc and he has told me some strange
things in the first place this castro
who was murdered was one of his best
men and here in new york in search of
a fellow they want badly down there
castros shop and his chocolate-beans
were only a clever disguise he was hot
upon the trail of the man he was after
when he suddenly-well died

 who was he tracing howard
queried eagerly of the mexican

   bruno estario was the reply

   the very man  caught only a half-
hour ago-or at least a friend of mine
caught him

   you - arc - sure   sanchez ex-
claimed springing to his feet

   certain the same man who helped
him to escape caught him hes held
at seventy - sixth street station now
there were two of them

   i cannot-believe  

   well we can quickly prove it to
you the chief interrupted  ill send
for them and well soon decide it do
you know this estario  

  a knowing smile broke over the mexi-
cans face

   yes i know him

  two policemen were despatched to
bring the prisoners to headquarters and
as they departed sanchez turned to
howard i congratulate

   for what  the chief demanded
 he hasnt solved the mystery of who
killed castro

   wait this estario-he know

  the entire case was discussed by the
three men until they were interrupted by
g

the argosy

the entrance of the two policemen and
the prisoners

  so bruno estario i at inst wc
meet  sanchez hissed

  but the other made no reply

   i have the pleasure to take you to
mexico as company sanchcz taunted
estario fat ed his accuser

   you think so hut you will not i
will stay here and be hung because 
killed that detectivc of yours castro
who thinks himself so smart to mask for
over a year as chocolate bill  knew
him all the time  knew every move
he made and when he got too close upon
my trail i killed him 

  you killed castro the chief ex-
claimed in amazement

   yes i killed him i 

   seftor estario lies burst out the
other mexican  his pride makes him
crazy he would rather die than go
back to mexico a prisoner but while
there is life there is hope he will yet
be a free man to enjoy his wealth

  the quickness with which things were
happening was almost too much for the
listeners to grasp but sanchez burst out
 estario docs lie ho has not the nerve
to kill a man nnd would not as long as
his wealth lasts to hire for him servants
who will do his dirty work ask him
how he did it

   yes how did you do it the chief
demanded

  for a moment there was n reply
then the other said sadly  pedro is
right while there is life there is
hope anti i hope for a pardon some day
from the mexican government i did
not tlo it 

   but  tlitl  the other prisoner as- 
sertcd   did it in self-defense i

knew castro anti just what his mission
was here in the city the setivr know
too so i watch castro as a cat watch
a mouse i was aware of his every
move

  he was now talking excitedly  
know he has a detective agency looking
up a man-the same man i see outside
as we come in - to try anti trace the
seflor  know when the agency send
him those papers and the next morning
when lie opens his shop i am waiting
there i demand the papers and he
laugh at me then he rush at me 
jump one side and get strong grip on
his throat he struggle but i still hold
him i know if i let go lie kill me
so i hold his throat 

  he paused then added regretfully
 i hold it too long-too long those
papers  take i have them here in my
pocket

  a few words more and the two pris-
oners were led to separate cells one to
await the transfer to mexico the other
to face tbe ortleal of a trial for his life

  the wheels of justice were quickly set
in motion for the release of schwartz
the unfortunate jew still in jail charged
with a crime of which he was absolutely
innocent

  as howard and sanchez left the chief
anti met porter in the outside room the
mexican exclaimed   am glad to
meet you and i congratulate meet me
here tomorrow i will have the reward
for you then

  there were tears in porters eyes when
he shook hands with howard as he left
the building

   stranger he said  yell never
know what ye have done for me and
marty

  when the dance is done

now the flush autumn homing from the dance
of summer sunbeams dreaming oer the words
of suing winds and humming still the last
mazurka of the orchestra of birds

a moment pauses hy the rivers jjlass

  to scan the signs of weariness that show

then lays aside her purple and her gold

         what happened when a fellow in hard luck deliber-
         ately expended his last lifteen cents on a clean collar

i came on from marshall michigan
with seventy dollars pinned in my
inside vest-pocket and a bee in my bonnet
that  was going to get a job right off
the reel at one hundred and fifty a
month that is a huge salary in mar-
shall for a young man and i naturally
felt quite chesty over my prospects

  but-after ten days ill new york city
i had neither the money nor the job

  it was then that i bethought myself
of my mothers school-day friend mr
wright who when passing through mar-
shall during my absence had left his
address for me and asked that i look him
up when  came on to the city

  he was a big man in the groccry line
and now that my job had fallen through
i thought i might as well go over and
tackle him for one

  i remembered that mother had given
me his address and told me to be sure
to call upon him so  spent an hour
looking for the direction but it was not
among my effects

  i had a vague notion that mother had
told me where the address was but rigid
search did not reveal it

  when i was down to my last cent i
wrote home for the address of mr
wright in quite a casual way as though
it were not a matter of meat and drink
to me then i looked around for the
wherewithal to get my next meal

  the only jewelry i possessed was a
pair of gold cuff-links  took them out
rolled up my sleeves and tried to get
used to going without them but in ten
minutes they were hack in their places
and i had decided not to  hock  them

  sentiment had something to do with
it but as a matter of fact i had a sort
of moral scruple against pawning any-
thing i had never borrowed money and
 didnt like to begin now sort of a
provincial idea possibly but ive found
it most satisfying

     a

  suddenly  thought of my books
there were possibly ten in the lot and i
liked them all but books can be re-
placed i had bought them with my
own money i felt that there was little
sentiment attached to them so  sud-
denly decided that it would be an easy
way out of the difficulty to sell the lot

  a short scrutiny showed me that they
were of no particular value there was
crabbcs  synonyms my little gift edi-
tion of  omar a few popular novels
and my good old copy of the  autocrat
of the break fast-table

  that was the only look that i could
not bear to part with i usually had it
with me there was something very close
and intimate in our relations i knew
every blotch on its well-worn covers

  for some minutes  debated then
forcing back my feelings i added this
treasure wrapped them all up and
started for a near-by bookstore

  the dealer looked the bunch over with
a deprecating air and my spirits kept
going down a little further with each one
that he picked up

  that crabbc is worth forty cents i
can give you about a dollar for the rest
of the hunch i guess he told me finally

   picked up my beloved  autocrat

  what is that one worth i asked

  lie took the volume from my hands

   hadnt noticed it was his comment
as he turned to the title page

  then he looked interested

   blue and gold edition he exclaimed
 well theyre not very scarcc but
theres a fair demand for them ill give
you sixty cents for it

  i hesitated the fact was i had never
before considered my copy of the  auto-
rrat  with regard to its cash value it
all came to me in a new light this book
priceless to me was worth only sixty
cents to the world

  crabbc at forty and the rest at a dol-


 ik argosy

lar that would be only a dollar forty
 had figured on two dollars anyway it
was hard hut i needed the money

   well sixty cents will be all right i
agreed thinking that the lirt dollar 
got after i connected with mr wright
would be spent in getting back my vol-
ume

  lie threw the book to one side and
gave me a two-dollar bill

  the crinkle of it was mighty consoling
i sighed when i was forced to break the
two-spot to spend a quarter for my first
meal that day

  then i went home and sat around
waiting for a reply to my letter i grew
to have the utmost faith in my mothers
friend in the grocery business he was my
last hope and surely would not fad me

  i couldnt bear to write home for
money i would far rather trust to luck
and mr wright i had started off with
seventy dollars and that was a lot in
the little home town they would not be
able to understand what i had done
what extravagances  had fallen into in
such a short time that had made me run
through this princely sum in ten days

  a shiny nickel and a bright dime were
the only coins that remained to rub
against cach other in my trousers pocket
when mothers letter came

  i plckcd it up eagerly now -now i
would get the address go to the man in
the grocery business and get a job from
him the folks would never know how
close to starvation i had really come

  the letter opened with a few notes
concerning local happenings and  rapid-
ly skipped to the part that interested me
most just then

  about mr wrights address- 
rend  dont you remember my boy 
told you that wc wrote it down for you
just before he left as you werent there
to take it down yourself

  yes  remembered that hut where

   just take up your copy of the  auto-
crat of the hreakfast-table and you
will find it carefully written on the back
page

  then i remembered mother had told
me about it before she had explained
nt length how she had made it dear to
him that the book and i were inseparable
companions and that i would never lose
the address if it were written there

  what a fool  had been to sell itl

  why even at the time it had been
against my better judgment

   j list take up your copy of the  auto-
crat - i quoted

  h if i could only have done so

  why hadnt i remembered that the
address was there why hadnt i given
in to the sentiment that possessed me to
keep the book

  but this was no time for remorse it
came to me suddenly that there might
yet be an opportunity to remedy things

  leaping for my hat i slammed it on
and dashed off for the book-stall where
 had sold the volume

  the proprietor was not in i eagerly
asked his assistant to show me what
copies he had of holmess masterpiece

  he brought out several different ones
i looked at each the covers were suf
ficicnt to show me that the book i was
seeking was not among them

  did he remember selling one bound in
blue cloth and the name printed in gold

  no lie had no memory for that but
the  boss  might know

  while waiting for the proprietor i
hunted through the whole shop turned
every odd book that i came to and peered
into all sorts of dark holes in search of
the volume hut it was nowhere to be
seen

  then i began again to curse my stu-
pidity mother did not correspond with
mr wright and nobody at home would
be able to give me the address it was
irretrievably lost

 and now what was i to do the
foundation had suddenly been knocked
from my dreams i missed the pedestal
on which  had been snoozing and sud-
denly dropped to earth

  everything seemed hopeless i had a
vague intuition that  would never re-
cover the book there was nobody to
blame but myself and i felt my disap-
pointment the more keenly on that ac-
count here i was with nothing in the
world but my pritle - and fifteen cents

   when will the proprietor be back
i asked abruptly the stuffiness of the
shop and the oppression of my thoughts
making me faint

  i dont know exactly you might
leave word for him and drop in later
suggested the clerk
cracked eggs

 

   thought rapidly for a moment and
then taking out a pencil scribbled a note
to the dealer giving my address and
offering two dollar for the book re-
questing that he send it over if he had
not already disposed of it

   lhen  left at once

  suddenly the realization stole over me
that ray collar was dirty and wilted i
didnt have the money to pay for my
laundry and i must have another collar
at once my pride would not allow me
to go about like this

  then  thought of food i should
save my fifteen cents for that hut of a
sudden a giddiness possessed me  felt
a desire to be absolutely penniless and it
was with the exhilaration of a spend-
thrift that i stepped into a furnishing
shop and spent my last cent for a collar

  when i came out i gradually realized
the foolhardiness of my act and began
to feel that  was very hungry every-
thing was blue  looked on the world
through the bluest glasses the world
offered no hope here i was -

  my musings were suddenly cut short
a large heavily packed wagon had
made a sudden swerve and skidded into
the track of a fast-coming trolley-car
there was a bump the frenzied driver
pulled his horses up short and tried to
jerk them from the track they wheeled
sharply and with a jolt the top-heavy
load swung far out a crash the
wagon and its contents lay overturned
across the street

  in my peculiar state of mind the inci-
dent struck me as funny i smiled for
the wagon had been loaded with crates of
eggs and several of the boxes had burst

-	the yolks and whites were mingling in
pools on the pavement

  then  saw the driver pull himself
out from the wreckage and  slowly
realized that the thing wasnt such a joke
after all

   saw him rise and gaze ruefully at the
wreck something in his eyes hurt me
i felt a big sympathy lor the fellow  he
was about my age our situations
seemed analogous

  somebody would have to pay for those
eggs  knew  and somehow from look-
ing at the young mans fixed face i felt
pretty certain that he would be the one
to suffer

  the thought came to me-if i could
only help him  hut how could i  sure-
ly i was in no position to pay for the
broken eggs

  keeling a bond of sympathy  hur-
ried over to  here he stood

   who will have to pay for the broken
lggs i asked

     will i gues for most of them
anyway he answered his eyes still fixed
in a meaningless stare

  but cant you do something i
asked nervously

   no he replied dumbly some of
them are flowing over the street already
and the rest will be pretty soon theyre
all cracked theres no doubt about that
and what good is a cracked egg

  the thing did seem rather hopeless i
had never thought before-of what good
is a cracked egg

  determined to help him in some way
feeling that wc were in the same leaky
boat and both needed somebody to help
bail i tried hard to figure out a solution

  suddenly an inspiration seized me i
glanced quickly at the boxes the yolks
and whites were streaming through the
cracks of most of the cases already

  grabbing him by the shoulder i cried
 wait here i think i can help 

  with that  tore across the street and
rushed into a large bakery shop

   explained my idea to the proprietor
in a moment he was enthusiastic and
accepted the hurried offer  made him

  back into the street i rushed the
young teamster was standing there with
the same blank expression while the mo-
torman and conductor of the blocked car
with several policemen were trying to
clear the track of the cases and wagon

  already they were dragging the wagon
along to get it out of the way so that tlie
cars could pass crates of eggs were
bouncing out of the back of it continual-
ly but the men worked on to clear the
road regardless

  seizing the driver i shouted to him
 come on grab up one of those cases
and carry it to the bakery there

  i could see by his eyes that he didnt
understand but he dumbly obeyed and i
after urging several youths to follow my
example picked up one of the dripping
crates and rushed over to the basement of
the bakery shop


the argosy

  hy that time the baker bad turned out
half u dozen of hi men to help us and
inside of eight minutes every crate had
been rushed to the bakery

  the remains of many eggs were on the
street but the bulk of the load had been
transferred

  then the baker camc up to me with a
smile

   that was a good offer of yours he
remarked  well both make money by
it here ive been paying twenty-four
cents a dozen for eygs and you offer
these to me at fifteen all  need for
my cakes and frostings is the yolks and
the whites  dont care for the shells

  what good is a cracked egg i
smiled lo myself

  the teamster didnt get the drift of
things right away but when the baker
counted out full payment for the load at
fifteen cents a dozen he gazed around at
the tubs into which the workers were
putting the contents of the cracked shells
and a dim light of understanding spread
over his broad face

   why why i was going to sell these
for only twenty cents a dozen he broke
out  they were going to a big jobber
my companyll be out only five cents a
dozen

   well i guess they can stand that
i smiled

   stand that stand that  he was
gradually warming up to the realization
of the whole affair  why when they
find out that  had presence of mind
enough to sell the cracked eggs theyll do
nothing but talk about it ill get a
raise in pay other fellows have tipped
over loads and had to pay for them and
lost their jobs into the bargain thisll
be such a new idea for them theyll raise
my pay sure

  i was delighted he was so frankly
happy about his deliverance he had not
had time to thank me and  appreciated
his warmth of spirit

  suddenly he extended a wide hand

   say youre all right the teamster
grinned

  have a drink he asked as an
afterthought

   thanked him told him that  didnt
drink and started to walk off

   here  he called after me

  i stopped anil turned toward him

  he looked at my uit it was bedrag-
gled and dripping with the yolks and
whites of eggs i hadnt noticed it in
the excitement

   iet me show how much i thank you
by paying to have that suit cleaned and
pressed he offered peeling off a two-
dollar bill from the roll that the baker
had handed him

  it was a sore temptation it was no
more than right that  should accept it
yet something held me back i guess it
was that blooming pride of mine

  he took my refusal very badly his
manner was dissatisfied i knew that he
felt he must do something for me and
i was just about to reconsider his offer to
have my clothes cleaned when he burst
out

   well youll come and eat dinner
with me anyway its time for noon
hour well go out and take care of
the horses and then find a place to feed
our faces

  i remembered then that i was ill
hungry my acceptance was therefore
eager in spite of myself

  we took the horses to a safe place and
i waited until he called up the company
and told them the news

  turning to me with a smile he re-
marked 

   they took it just the way i thought
they would i get a raise sure thats
what you might call a lucky mishap

   it was that all right and im glad
i could help was my reply

  he insisted on taking me to an expen-
sive place to eat but knowing that he
could ill afford it i selected a simple
little restaurant and we sat down oppo-
site each other

  i guess he noticed from the way i tore
into my food that i was down and out
anyway after two or three crude at-
tempts he finally asked

  arent having hard lurk are you

  the thing was too vivid to be put aside

 had to tell him the whole story

   and the address was in the book he
repeated at the finish  well thats
a shame no wonder youre feeling
kind of down after thinking you
wouldnt part with it an then giving it
up for sixty cents an losing a job by
it-say thats almost as bad as tip-
ping over a wagonload of eggs
cracked eggs



  i told him that the similarity of our
situations had struck me before

  he chewed the remark over in his mind
for some moments and then delivered
his opinion

  our situations were alike hut now
theyre altogether different you helped
me out of my pickle an  aint made a
move to help you

   oh thats all right  laughed  my
position is rather helpless anyway

   not on your life it aint he an-
swered quickly

  there was a spirit of good fellowship
in the reply that made me mighty happy
to think id been able to befriend him

   hut theres no chance i repealed
dully  im much obliged to you for the
thought but the books gone and thats
the only hope i had

   well even if the book is gone well
find some way out of it he answered

  i half believed that wc would his de-
termination seemed to he growing so
strong

  for some minutes we both sat silent
then he looked up to ask 

   what was that fellows name that
you wanted to see  

   mr wright

   and you said he was in the grocery
business 

   yes i replied

  what are his initials

  i dont know i answered slowly
 you see mother always spoke of him as
just mr wright and i never heard his
first name

   that makes it hard he replied
 but well find him come well get
out of here ill take the afternoon off
and help you out

  i hadnt thought before of the possi-
bility of looking the man up but the sug-
gestion offered a hope and i fell in with
it readily when the teamster assured me
that he ran no danger of losing his job
by taking the time off

  we had sponged off most of the stains
from the eggs on my clothes and were
both in fairly good trim when we legati
our round of the different grocery stores
asking everywhere for mr wright my
friend was known to them all and in a
short time we were on the trail of
three mr wrights in the grocery busi-
ness

  it was two-thirty when we found the
last one i hadnt given up hope be-
cause my companion wouldnt let me so
we marched up to interview this third
mr wright

  having briefly sketched my story to
him i asked quaveringly if lie were the
right mr wright

  to my boundless surprise he answered

   well i should say i am i remem-
ber writing my address in that book for
you and im mighty glad to see the son
of my old schoolmate

  i had arrived at the haven at last and
my reception merited the struggle

  i believe there were tears in my eye
when i turned to grasp the hand of the
good driver who had led me to him  any-
way i know i was mighty happy lie
was too

  he waited in the hall for me while 
finished my arrangements to start to
work the next morning for mr wright
and my pride did not keep me from ta-
kinr a weeks salary in advance

  when  stepped out of the office i con-
gratulated myself on having bought a
clean collar with mv last fifteen cents
at least i was neat in spite of the eggs
and those stains were excused by the
story

  my new friend and i talked it all over
on the way home and we came to the
conclusion that its a mighty good thing
to lend the helping hand occasionally
even as a business investment it had paid
both of us and paid us well

  we parted at my door and i hurried in
to change my clothes

an overlooked possibility

 hy lloyd thachkk

  taking a chance with a chcck on a long-distance gamble

 it was two oclock on saturday after-
 noon in a large law office the sig-
 nificance of its being saturday afternoon
 lies in the fact that pay-day came at
 that time in the week

   some of tin clerks and officc attend-
 ants were apparently preparing to leave
 while others were frankly determined to
 await the arrival of the cashier who had
 most unaccountably failed to turn up
 all the members of the firm bad left an
 hour before ignorant of the anxiety in
 the minds of their employees

   sanders though a highly paid and
much trusted lawver connected with the
firm was as keenly eager as the smallest
officc-boy for the arrival of the cashier
because a combination of unhappy cir-
cumstances had left him with but two
ccii in his pocket

    he cant have run oft with the pay-
 money remarked one of the clerks

    lies got legs replied another

   it certainly was an unusual state of
 a flairs and the gravity of the situation
 can only be appreciated by those who at
 some time in thrir lives have been com-
 pelled to felv on a weekly wage for their
 sustenance

   it was therefore upon a group of
 extremely anxious faces that the cashier
 gazed when at last about  he en-
 tered the office

    been tied up in the subway he an-
 nounced  im awfully sorry for you
 fellows but youll have to wait until
 monday for your pay the bank closed
 at twelve

   sanders was perhaps the most un-
 happy one of the force he said noth-
 ing but turned resignedly to the solving
 of an interesting legal proposition upon
 which he was at work

   troubles do not always come iu num-
 bers arid his disappointment over the
 financial situation wa much lessened by
 the fact that after on hours work lie
 found a solution to the legal dilemma
 which had perplexed him for a week

  pleased with his success he was lean-
ing back in his chair when the ringing
of the telephone attracted his attention

   why dont one of the office-boys an-
swer it he said to himself

  again came the telephone call and
sanders looked round the office

  everybody gone eh he muttered
and proceeded to answer the call him-
self

  hallo i yes this is the number
what a moments pause followed
while sanders moved his chair closer to
the phone

  oh its you mary when did you
get in town  

  there was another much longer pause
while the young man was apparently re-
ceiving some interesting information

  at the down-town ferry are you
and you want me to come immediately
surely i will- something very urgent-
want me to bring plenty of money
what all right in about half an
hour

  sanders hung up the receiver with
a very happy expression on his face
which suddenly changed as he realized
the position he was in

  the girl who had just spoken was the
only girl in the world for him here
she was waiting for him on her way
through the city to her home a days
journey distant and relying on him as
she bad said to help her in the most
serious dilemma she had ever known

  money was needed temporarily and
he sat there with just two cents in his
pocket and no means of immediately
obtaining more

  never had his mind worked so rapidly
over any legal matter as it did now in
considering how he could obtain some
cash then the solution came to him

  it was after banking hours and a
check could not be deposited until mon-
day on which day he would get his pay

  his own little town some three hun-
dred miles away was the proud posses-
an overlooked possibility



sor of a bank in which from time to
time he was accustomed to deposit small
amounts the fact that he had no bal-
ance there at tins time did not interfere
with his plan he would draw a check
to-day and early on monday morning
would send his salary to the bank the
amount would be more than enough to
cover his check

  tc atvcr going through the ordinary
channels rould not possibly reach the

bank iwfore his deposit did he would
be able to help mary and perhaps per
sundc her to tell him something that for
years he had longed to hear

  it was a little dangerous no doubt
but surely not wrong under the circum-
stances nothing but the miscarriage of
his letter containing the money-order for
the amount of the check could defeat the
successful working out of the plan and
there was the same possibility that the
jnail might fail to carry the check safe-
ly at any rate sanders was determined
to try tbe scheme he had half an hour
in which to accomplish it before the girl
would expect him

  hastily putting on his hat and coat
he left the office locking the door behind
him

  his first thought was to get the money
at the cigar-stand in the building the
proprietor of which had known him for
years  but he had forgotten that it was
saturday afternoon he becamc pain-
fully conscious of this fact when he
found the stand closed for the day he
soon realized- that it would be a difficult
matter to find any place of business open
at this hour

  it is needless to recount the many re
buffs which he received in trying to cash
the check the time allotted to him
was rapidly diminishing a he tood on
the corner of the rather deserted street
trying his best to think of some wealthy
business man who knew him and who
was likely to remain at his office late on
half holidays

  then camc the inspiration-rand 
company-about a mile up town had
known him and his family ever since he
could remember would be sure to give
him the money he required they al-
ways kept open late he also realized
that mr rand was marys guardian
and that it would be to him that he

would have to go if mary should give
the answer to him which he hoped and
prayed that she might

  there was great necessity for haste
and the young man jumped on a car

  the approach of the conductor how-
ever brought new complications san-
ders remembered that he had but two
cents in his pocket making a clean
breast of that fact to the official a good-
natured elderly man he received the in-
formation that he must get off at once
the conductor seemed interested in the
young man however and asked him how
far he had intended to go what was his
purpose in going there how he happened
to be so foolish as to get on a car expect
ifig to ride when he had no money and
numerous other questions to which san-
ders gave lengthy and lucid answers

  at length with something of humor
in his eye the conductor pulled the bell-
rope and remarked   this is your street
young man never try to beat the rail-
road again

  realizing that the kind hearted col-
lector of fares had done in one way what
lie could not do in another sanders
alighted and entered the place of busi-
ness of rand  company

  mr rand himself was there and
heard the young mans request that his
check be cashed with rather an uncom-
promising expression

   its a bad principle lie said  i
think i know you and  am sure that i
knew your father but i have always
made it a practise never to cash checks
for people not dealing with us

   but  need the money so badly
replied sanders and i assure you that
the check will be all right

   you are a friend of marys  be-
lieve continued the older man shrewdly

    i sincerely hope so replied sanders
thinking it best from the mysterious and
urgent tone which the girl had used in
speaking to him not to mention the fact
that he was going to see her soon

  all right concluded mr rand
 ill cash your check but be sure that it
is good or i will use whatever influence
i have with the girl to have nothing
more to do with you

  sanders drew bis check for fifty dollars
with a decided feeling of thankfulness in
his heart received the money and start-


the argosy

ed by the quickest way for the place
where he would find the girl

  it was nearly half-past five when at
last sanders stood before her and heard
the beginning of her story

   hut we had best hurry up-town he
interrupted  or we cannot accomplish
what you want done you can tell me
all about it as wc go along

  taking a hansom and directing the
driver to reach a certain address a
quickly as possible sanders asked her
to begin all over and tell him how he
could help her

   you see frank she continued
 when i passed through this city on the
way to the place where i have been visit-
ing  saw the most perfect little hat
you can imagine without a thought i
bought it and sent it home by express
then i made the horrible discovery that
i had left myself without enough money
for my trip it was the silliest kind of
a thing to do but not half as bad as my
next step

   i had heard about pawn-shops but
of course had never been inside of one
i was ashamed to go to m r rand  no
having only a few minutes to catch my
train i went into one of the horrid
places where we are going now and
pawned my ring for twenty-five dollars
i dare not go home without it for my
aunt and the whole family would never
stop laughing at me but i knew frank
that you would be glad to help me until
i get some money and send it to you i
dont want them ever to know

  the young man smiled at her serious-
ness and assured her that it ccrtainly
was the biggest kind of a pleasure for
him to help her

  by the time they had reached the pawn-
shop she had forgotten her shame over
the incident and was only fearful that
they would not reach the place before it
closed at six oclock

  they were fortunate in this regard
however and having secured the ring
decided to occupy the time before her
train left with a little drive and dinner

  the drive was a momentous one for
both while sanders hated to take ad-
vantage of at occasion on which he had
done the girl a favor he was not able to
withstand the temptation to tell her of
his love it was in a quiet place in the

large park that he found mary had un-
derstood long ago and understanding
had been glad it only remained for
him to see mr rand and get his ap-
proval

  this sanders determined to do that
very evening after he had put mary on
the train

  the girl bad not been gone five min-
utes before sanders was at the telephone
in the station trying to arrange for a
conference with mr rand the person
at the other end of the wire informed
him however that mr rand had gone
out of town and would not return until
early monday morning

  sunday was a long day to sanders
but it passed at last and the eagerly
looked for monday morning came san-
derss first duty was to get his salary and
send a money-ordcr for fifty dollars to
the bank at home

  as he dropped the important letter
into the mail-box ti tremendous sigh of
relief escaped him thc check which this
amount was to cover could not possibly
reach the bank as soon as this letter

  it took the young man but a short
time after that to reach the office of mr
rand and to send in his name to that
gentleman the messenger returned in
a moment with the most remarkable of
replies

   mr rand says he cannot sec you
said the boy

   please tell him it is very important
urged sanders  and will take but a
moment

  again the boy returned this time with
a much stronger message

   mr rand says he never wants to
see you again but that lie will write

   he cant have said that rejoined
sanders in amazement

   hut he did continued the boy
 and he said you knew why

   i havent the faintest idea and i
inns see him go back again please
and sav it is most important

  the boy returned the third time much
excitcd

   mr rand is very angry sir and says
to have you put out if you wont go

  this settled sanders and he was soon
standing on the street gazing up and
down trying to account for the others
strange behavior
in league with the black vultures



  what had he dune it couldnt he
about the check for there had not been
time for it even to be deposited yet

   at last he gave up trying to oolve the
mystery and returned to his office de
tcrmined to write  wait for the letter
mr hand had said he would send

  it was a very forlorn day for the
young man and his legal work suffered
a good ileal the hours dragged through
some way however night came as it
has a way of doing but with it little
sleep for sanders

   it was a very worn young man who pre-
sented himself at the office the following
morning and found there the expected
letter it was rather different from what
he bad expected for it said that the
writer had possibly been hasty the day
before and would so the young man
that morning and explain il any expla-
nation were necessary

  eagerly therefore sanders again
sought the offices of rand  company
and was ushered into the angry presence
of the head of the firm

   now young man began mr hand
 listen to what i have got to say then
you may tell me what induced you to do
as you did  but do not interrupt me

   when i cashed your check saturday

something seemed to tell me that there
was a mystery about it i did a thing i

have very seldom done i spent two dol-
lars and called up your bank on the
long distance telephone and inquired if
you had fifty dollars on deposit as i had
just cashed your check for that amount
they informed me that you had not a
cent in the bank and that they would
have to protest the check when it ar-
rived which would probably be on tues-
day

  several times sanders had attempted
to speak but the rising wrath of the
older man deterred him

  mr rond continued of all the
meanest lowest-

  the entrance of a messenger-boy with
a telegram interrupted the irate man
he opened the message and sat gazing
at it with perplexed eve  then he rend
it aloud

  phone message wrong deposit ar-
  rived this morniiik check will be
  honored

   i see young man-it was not busi-
nesslike but not what i thought it
was is there anything i can do for
you  

   yes replied sanders  want to
marry your ward

   i shall always be glad to grant you
any little favor like that replied mr
rand

   wanted-a young man to start im
 mediately for south america must be
 brave and have a bridled tongue ap-
 ply to s saveros  park lane

the voutig fellow on a bench in
union square read the advertise-
ment four times and waited twenty min-
utes before deciding

 it was his second week as a city
lounger and he had grown desperate for
work day after day he had haunted
the pork and became one of the bench
brigade hope and despair often held

pitched battles before his hungry eyes
anil despair always won out

  he was on the rocks alone in a
country town he bad ventured to the
city and found out bis mistake nobody
wanted anybody bccousc of hard times

  two minutes ago he had picked up a
section of a morning newspaper on the
seat beside him and stumbled across the
advertisement of hope south america
was a far cry but he didnt care it
held out a possibility of food and shel-
ter

  yes nick draper rather thought hed


the argosv

investigate the original advertising ge-
nius s saveros

  hr deserted union square and shaped
a course down-town

  park ianc could easily have been
named  anarchist alley draper had
heard of the place in the newspaper
bombs and red lags lurked hidden be-
hind dingy building fronts in that noto-
rious neighborhood but he had figured
it out and disposed of that probability
there were no kings nnd queens to be
assassinated in south america

  no  turned out to be a cigar-storc
evidently business was not flourishing
if tobacco was the sole source of the
proprietors income

  there was no moist fragrant odor as
the prospective customer entered it
was all dry and dusty and parched look-
ing show-case and the banked cigar
boxes behind were soiled nnd caked with
dust

  a thin board partition provided with
a door divided the store in half as
draper pushed through the front cn-
trancc a bell rang over his head and a
man issued from the hidden regions be-
yond

  tic was spare nnd spanish the yel-
low skin of his face was like sun-baked
parchment his eyes were as black as
twin coals his movements restless quick
eager

  you w xiid have rated him a fine chap
to strangle a man on a dark night

  mr saveros draper intimated
whereat the other nodded shortly a
shade suspiciously  i saw your ad-
vertisement in the ifraid if you care
to examine me perhaps i might do for
the work

  the south american thawed a trifle

   ah you have answered tefor be
said  the work you speak of is daring
beyond all but it is a great work and
most honorable if you undertake the
mission and never falter you will strike
a blow for humanity seflor but come
follow me we will go in the back
room where we can smoke and talk in
peaceful security this way seiior

  draper went after him around the end
of the counter in the screened-off half
of the store were some chairs a pine
table and a bed that cried to high
heaven for a chambermaid

  a cheap colored print of the young
king of spain hung on the wall for the
world to see plainly saveros had not
banded himself with his ribald country-
men of the quarter

  he tossed out a package of cigarettes
scraped a match along the tablc-cdgc
and held the tiny flame for draper to
suck at

   the mission concerns two coun-
tries saveros began finding his words
cautiously nnd standing the cigarcttc-
box end on end as he went on  one is
pink  the man-made map of the world
the other blue but the people seiior
are of one heart united both have red
blood-red and warm our idea wc
of the league of black vultures is to-
what do you a meric a nos say-to merge
to make one noble country of two little
pig-stics i

   rio santa and porto pinto unitcu
what a grand what a glorious what a
powerful country  as one we could
compete with brazil in trade and war
we of the vultures are of both places
political exiles and many praise the
virgin but we want two brave men
one we have secured the other-
maybe you seiior

  draper could feel the lure of adven-
ture flow within him

  fire ahead ive a thousand ears
to hear he said

   we want revolution but no blood-
shed saveros pursued in his dry even
little monotone  rio santa and porto
pinto are ruled by twin oppressors
each lins n butcher presidents who
leads army and state by the nose santa
maria it makes the blood foam scrtvr
seiior  lie shouted in a convulsed whis-
per once we capture those dictating
devils we have won tbat is our cause
but we dare not do this ourselves wc
arc watched and wanted

   you are operating from here in the
states

   partly yes but not wholly that
would be fruitless useless why- you
can see i am one of the agents sent out
by the league to scour the globe for help-
ers there is no hurry and we have
money in abundance

  draper was looking him over shrewdly

   let me understand you saveros you
want me to capture one of these presi-
in league with the black vultures



dcnle follows and turn him over to your
baud of revolution lets the other one
seems to have been provided for you
count on that to carry the day turn the
troops i take it but suppose i get
caught touching off the fireworks it
may be a ease of prison and the firing

squad

   the advertisement said the appli-
cant must be brave and silent said
saveros enigmatically

  if that scared draper he hid his fear
easily

    see lie nodded carelessly  what
else is there who pays my fore to the
banana lands

   all that is detail your ticket for
rio santa will ik bought and turned
over to you immediately you decide to
go ample funds will be provided
you will have sealed orders delivered
to you once at the capital of rio
santa you will open them and follow
instructions and if the venture is suc-
cessful scior you will receive as your
share of the reward ten thousand dol-
lars  

   get out there  scoffed draper
 youre stringing me

  saveros drew himself up proudly

   on the honor of a spanish gentle-
man my word sciror has never been
doubted

   beg pardon old man but you see
its been so long since ive seen the green
side of a dear old dollar bill that ten
thousand of them sounds kind of like a
parade well ill go you of course

  nick draper pressed out his ashy
cigarette stub with his thumb and fore-
finger

  how about some advance money
lie added  im hollow enough to
echo

  saveros smiled reached across and
grasped his hand

   that is good gefior and i am glad
beyond speech many have applied but
you only suit be back here at eight
oclock to-night then all will have
been arranged

  he stared draper over thoughtfully
 your clothes are poor and you are
hungry  will give you money out of
my own private purse for present needs
you are our brother now

  and two days later nick draper was

a passenger on a south american coaster
bound for rio santa he had scoured
himself and togged out his person in
blue serge low shoes and panama straw
none of his will-of-the-wisp friends of
union square would have could have
recognized him as he leaned prosperous-
ly on the rail and bemoaned the green
disgrace on the goddess of liberty

  a bulldog revolver bulged one cor-
ner of his hip saveross envelope of
scaled orders was in his breast-pocket
he was happy and expectant

  he thought of the open-mouthed as-
tonishment of the crowd at silkinss
grocery out home if it had seen him then
and smiled amiably

  the first sight of rio santa looks like
the back drop of a south american
comic opera blue water sandy beach
quaint white city green palm-trees-all
these greet the eye draper was re-
minded of an advertising poster of a
tropical steamship company he had once
seen

  the water near shore was crowded
with soapy shoals and sand-bars and
they had to land the passengers in skiffs
it was proposed to scoop out a channel
to the ancient docks some day but the
government had postponed and post-
poned and the story had become a
legend

  draper on his sea legs found lodg-
ings in a subdued part of town now
was comc the time to open his sealed in-
structions he locked the door of his
room securely and brought out his let-
ter first he read his name scrawled
across the face turned the envelope
over inserted a thumb at either end and
ripped open the ilap inside was a sin-
gle narrow strip of paper draper
screwed his forehead and read slowly

  consult alfonso cnrao at no 

  plaza the password i  liberty

  the holy mother guide your arm

   now what the devil does that
mean mused the yankee emissary
 you never can tell alout these cut-
throats who play their cards in the dark
but im too deep in the game to back
out now ill just keep nick drapers
fingers crossed and his eyes wide open
and shoot off my little popgun if i gel
a ilea in my car now for no  plaza


the argosy

  he found the placc without difficulty
it was a great warehouse of some sort
facing the public square and carazo
teemed to be the janitor otherwise

the place was deserted

  draper found him by adroitly worded
questioning at the winc-shop next door
he rose timorously out of a huge pack-
ing-case as soon as our tyro swashbuckler
called to him hut when draper whis-
pered the password of the vultures he
was all confidence

    ou are the second man then   he
whispered hack  the other has been
despatched to porto pinto come this
way siilor you are indeed lucky to
come at a session hut make no noise

  he picked his way a docn steps
among the bales and turned suddenly

   sefior the oath has not been taken
you must swear by all you hold sacred
that you will never talk of what you will
see and hear here your promise before
we proceed you must be loyal what-
ever befalls

  draper hesitated promises were
ticklish things to break and so many
contingencies could arise but that old
insistent call to adventure urged him on
and be bowed to the dictum of carazo

   all right he said raising his right
hand  i swear to be good

  carazo moved on satisfied draper
close lchind him the way wound in
and out through a wooden maze of
stacked boxes by and by they went
down a shak flight of stairs in the dark

  beneath the steps the guide paused
and draper heard his knuckles rap on
what was evidently a door a narrow
perpendicular ribbon of yellow light
barred the gloom whispers between
carazo and an unknown and the ribbon
widened and the yankee was allowed to
enter

  six men were in a little compart-
ment - like cubbyhole packing - crates
answered for furniture cobwebs fes-
tooned the ceiling

  draper blinked at the feeble oil-lamp
and took mental stock of his new com-
panions none were engaging looking
personages and he cuddled his hand ill
iiis hide-pocket where his revolver lay
carazo had closed himself out and de-
parted  our adventurer introduced
himself airily

  good evening gentlemen he
knew enough broken spanish to sec him
through  im draper late of new
york and one time billed for the dis-
card but a friend of yours sent me
down here to seize a bold bad dictator
i am ready who arc you

  one of the company came forward

   ah you are welcome senor  he
avowed  wc have waited long for the
right spirit to lead us the good ca-
razo says you know the password and
that is sufficient even had we not had a
letter from our brother in the north
he described you and you answer well
but sefior he went on spreading his
hands in implied apology  a black vul-
ture must know how to swoop can
you swoop amtricanol 

  draper grinned

   why yes he said carclcssly  i
guess i can manage to learn but 
cant work blindfolded he hinted

   to be sure you cannot the other
hastened to reply  we have called a
special meeting of the league we are
legion as the sand on jose felipe bcach
the hour of dawn is here the voice
of liberty and unity is everywhere clam-
oring to be heard it comes over the
sea by day it sobs in the night wind
well win well win well win

  his voice had risen and died

   but i paint pictures with words
he went on  senor it is the time for
swift brave action a blow must be
struck at the heart of despotism to
you the honor falls the second of your
race one of your countrymen has gone
to porto pinto on like service seftor
draper you must shoot the dictator of
rio santa am i not right my broth-
ers 

  there could be no mistaking the nods
and softly spoken words that traveled
around that circle

  draper had whitened and his thoughts
hew into a merry-go-round this was
decidedly more than he had bargained
for

  the league of black vultures had
shown its evil hand it was a secret
gang of murderers

  lie thought quickly so that cigar-
store indian in new york had said there
would k no bloodshed saveros had
lied by the clock nick draper wasnt
in league with the li lack vultures



going to turn murderer but hed see this
thing to a finish

  it was beginning to grow exciting
and hed pledged his word no he
wouldnt welch

  so he mused in the space of time tbat
was given him and a grim smile played
around his mouth he bowed bis con-
sent anil the head rascal went into de-
tails

   such is your part nnd your share of
the fulfilment will be large the
south americans eyes shone black and
wild  you should not have such a
hard road to travel seiior it will be
simple to arrange an audience with
 president- you are let us imagine
a promoter from big america you
would discuss politics with the ruling
devil then the minute you cc him
a quick eye and a puff of smoke and
fire i you see you pee seiior but no
fooling no betrayal if you waver the
carrion will gnaw your bones you
see  

  yes draper saw it was all fiendish-
ly unadorned hut he managed to hide
his anger and nod his head to signify
he understood

  later when he had mounted the
creaking stairs threaded his way to the
cool pure evening air without and
strolled back to his room smoking a re-
flective cigarette he was half sorry he
hadnt backed out hut it was too late
now to grieve over bygones

ii

  the greatest man in rio santa was
dictator de rivero he had provided
for himself spacious quarters the pal-
ace was like the country place of an
american millionaire the building
was white splashed with red awnings
dented by shady verandas around all
was an iron railing skirting n green
lawn

  the soldiers of kio santa stationed
within the grounds matched the color
scheme of the house-white uniforms
with crimson cuffs stripes and collar-
bands el prcsidcntcs official office
was to the right of the main hall as you
went in

  here from ten to twelve behind n
maple wood table flanked by bis secre-

tary sat the autocrat of the republic
lie dictated interviewed made laws
and said secretary was an american girl
who was master of laughing brown eyes
and a remington typewriter that rattled
under her flying fingers so much for
dry statistics

  thither on the morrow repaired nick
draper trapped tool of the league of
vultures murderers scapegoat cool col-
lected lie had planned his campaign
through the night watches and if dc
rivera wasnt a coward it was bound to
go through without a hitch anywhere

  he had no trouble reaching the inner
portal the stenographer was demurely
taking notes and the dictator was oppo-
site her mopping his forehead talking
walking he was all white duck and
perspiration draper coughed and he
whirled around on him

   beg pardon mr prcsidcntc nick
said quickly  but may  have you nlone
for two minutes i promise you my
news bears no delay he turned as if
it was quite settled and bowed to the
girl  if the young lady will oblige
the dictator signed for her to leave
and she gathered her notes into a rough
heap and went out once she was clear
of the room draper darted a shrewd
glance around

  there was only one door and a single
window-behind him to his satisfac-
tion also the secretary had saved him
an awkward necessity and closed that
door after her no one would disturb
them if he worked fast

  presidentc de rivera had seated him-
self his olive face curious nnd the newly
recruited free lancc did the same on the
other side of the maplcwood table

   you arc of the states and a
stranger intimated the ruler of rio
santa  the senorita hlake should
have waited you arc a countryman of
hers and she is homesick hut what
can i do for you

   nothing declared draper bluntly
 mr presidentc did you ever hear of
the league of black vultures

  the dictator was a trifle surprised

   ah then you know of them-that
cowardly organization he demanded
 hey llv at you from cover when its
dark i have instructed my secret po-
lice they will be wiped into the earth


the argosy

you come from them you comc to
warn me hut i want neither advice
nor threats  have no fear

   dont deceive yourself pleaded
draper in haste  take a good look at
me and listen to what ive got to say
your enemies are everywhere and plot
to take your life i myself have been
sent here to kill you de rivera whoa
there not so fast with that gun-arm

  draper had him covered as quickly as
a cowixiy could have turned the trick
he went on evenly looking along the
silver pipe of his leveled weapon

   hut dont be afraid i dont shoot
down men who cant shoot back that
isnt the yankee way yet  have
promised and devised a little scheme to
get around that difficulty we will rise
together you and i walk to far cor-
ner of the room count ten turn and
fire i suppose the quickest man wins
hows your sporting nerve you will
observe a slight pressure of my fore-
finger would send you to eternity right
off the reel i wouldnt strongly advise
you to dicker to dodge im getting
restless its a gentlemans chance

 de rivera had been caught by
drapers pointing revolver half out of
his chair but in the old days he had
been a soldier who had seen fighting and
his couragc was good

  he looked casually about him and
comprehended his daredevil visitor had
him foul hut if the situation was deli-
cate he was not to be outdone he in-
clined his head stiffly and that was all
that sealed the compact beyond chance
of change

  but it was enough each man knew
instinctively that the other could be
trusted to deal from the top of the deck
face up

  neither spoke as they backed against
the maplewood table and started slowly
toward their corncrs draper had
watched the dictator pull out a drawer
and rummage around some loose papers
for his pistol he had watched the fat
stubby fingers grip the butt curve around
the trigger now he closed his eyes as
he walked and thought of his past sins

  he reached his end of the room fifst
and waited it would be all over in a
second now suddenly he heard the
presidente counting the yankee kept

even with him measuring off the num-
bers one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten i

  nick draper pivoted around and
twitched his first finger sharply back
he fired purposely wide through the
smoke of his own discharge he saw his
enemys revolver spurt out at him

  on the heels of that a boring pain
struck into his shoulder spinning him
sideways against the wall and before
he could wipe the sudden mists out of
his eyes a draft of cool air blew the smoke
around the room and something white
and lithe darted into the lead zone

  it was the girl back again there she
stood between the dueling men like a
disordered outraged frightened queen
she was trembling

   oh stop  she panted  dont
-dont hurt each other dont shoot-
any morel what has happened this
is dreadful you-you mustnt-either
of you 

  draper had taken out his handkerchief
and was binding it awkwardly about his
wounded shoulder he winccd as he
drew the loop tight

  capture and prison and death would
have to be reckoned with now he had
played the game and lost out hut he
caught himself looking up at the girl
while he worked

  it was an odd time to think of such a
thing but he had a mad glad desire to
tuck back a strand of her autumn brown
hair that had slipped out of her pompa-
dour rut draper was a man in such
things and couldnt understand

  the tableau miss hlake had created
was galvanized back to life the next sec-
ond a shadow slanted across the floor
darkening the light in the room some-
body had paused at the open window be-
hind draper iike a sound out of the
invisible a voice cried aloud in furious
hate

   the yankee pig has betrayed us 
it screamed  death to the despot 

  eraper nearest whirled toward the
speaker the vapor of smoke was slow-
ly curling out of the window and up-
ward caught by the gentle breeze hut
an evil face stared insolently into the
room from without

  it was one of the vultures draper had
seen at the warehouse yesterday be-
in league with the black vultures

g

fore a move could be made to stop him
he shin forward his right arm and report
after report banged at the end of his
hand

  at the first shot the dictator raised his
hands and pitched headlong half under
the maplewood tabic the girl was
rooted to the carpet by the horror of the
deliberate attack

  the yankee had laid aside bin revolver
to manipulate his bandage with some
amount of certainty now one thought
swamped all else

  a woman was in danger the fiend
at the window was wild with the lust to
kill but in his excitement his aim was
fortunately bad nick flew to the girl
and hurried her bodily away

  the palacc and lawn were in an up-
roar of terror men rai for their arms
helter-skelter taking up the cry the
dictator is dead  the dictator is dead
long live liberty long live the
people i 

  beyond the grounds the town took up
the shout the ieaguc of black vul-
tures was alive revolution had come
again to rio santa

  draper scarcely breathed until he
reached the hall with the fear-stricken
girl

  arc you hit anywhere he took a
precious second to ask fearfully

    no no white pallor had blanched
her cheeks and her voice wavered  hut
you-your shoulder you cant run can
you

  he saw how hard she was trying to
be brave

   never mind me pressing her limp
hand tighter  its only a scratch
which way shall we go you know the
house better than i do but dont hesi-
tate some of those rebellious rascals
will break in here any minute

   theres a back door down in the
cellar she said eager to help him
 perhaps we can escape them that way
ill show you the stairs

   come on then and dont let go
of me

  two minutes later they were groping
around a black pit of mystery under the
house it was as dark as if a jet cur-
tain had been drawn around them

  draper put out his free hand and
moved it about in a half-circle before

his face he took cautious steps and
listened

  the girl had been swallowed up in the
gloom at his side but he heard her try-
ing to catch her breath in sharp little
gasps < >nly a vague murmur of sounds
came from the regions above stairs

   the doors over there whispered
mabel blake tugging off to one side
 what a dreadful spooky placc i

  but under her lead they brought up
against a solid wall draper bethought
himself of his matches lie reached in
his pocket hopefully but drew out his
hand disappointed

  the box had been lost somewhere
along the line of light there was
nothing to do but edge carefully along
the wall draper in the lead perhaps
that would necessitate a circuit of the
whole cellar but it was a sure way of
finding the door of deliverance

  the noise above had heightened a
smothered cheer was heard by the lost
man and woman in the dark the next
instant feet tramped and pounded over-
head and then the light strengthened
feebly

  draper looked over his shoulder and
drowned down a cry of sudden dismay
he had made out the glow of lanterns
on the cellar-steps the lights moved
downward swinging to and fro and
shadowy men showed behind them

   rout them out men of rio santa 
some one gave command  kneel and
fire low the pest-house rats arc here
somewhere manuel saw them run this
way

  drapers heart shot into his mouth
the rebels on the stairs were going to
rake the cellar from center to circumfer-
ence with a fine-tooth comb of flame
lie could see the yellow streaks spitting
through the black gloom could imagine
them circling nearer and nearer until
he was cut down and the girl-

  he leaped frantically in front of her
no they mustnt shoot the girl at any
cost he could give himself up and
doubtless that would insure her safe
conduct

  so he wrapped his curved hands
around his mouth and shouted up at those
flickering lights  theres no one down
here to fight he called out  wont
you let the young lady with me go she


the argosy

had no part in this quarrel  sur-
render

  a short silence followed his words
then who are you sefiorf ques-
tioned the lantern holder who had spoken
before  step forward and fear noth-
ing my nn-n will have you covered
are you a citizen of rio santa

   we are american subjects each of
us the sc flo fit a was el presidentes sec-
retary

  draper and the girl came forward to
the foot of the steps where the light was
better their captors wore army uni-
forms and the pointing mausers of the
party were drawn and ready to pump
out leaping death at the first sign of
flight or hostility

  mabel blake shivered and drew a lit-
tle closer to the man beside her no
word was spoken to them once the
prisoners were surrounded

  now that he was in the toils of the
scamps he had in a measure gone back
on nick draper looked for a short shrift
and no favor the victory of the insur-
rectionists was apparently sweeping com-
plete	

  there had been no battle to dispute
their seizure of the reins of the republic
only the butchering of a president that
the tale might be written in blood

   ah well it didnt so much matter what
bccamc of him draper told himself
there were harder worse things in life
than dying and be was alone penniless
but all at once a slim hope buoyed
him up

  if the american consul heard of his
plight that might save him he pro-
tection of the stars and stripes was his
by birthright he bccamc full of the
idea how to get word to the consulate
was the problem

   the fellow in charge of the cellar de-
tachment detailed two of his turncoats
to escort the prisoners up-stairs draper
was cuffed along and generally handled
roughly but he was thankful thnt miss
blake came in for no share of the abuse

  in the upper hall they were conducted
into the very room where the little drama
of south america had taken place

  here a sensation struck them numb
with amazement it was too sudden for
words too startling by far to remain
normal about

  draper stared ns if the moon had
dropped out of the dome of the sky
maliel blake gave a little scream of only
half-realized delight behind the maple-
wood table sat the dictator of rio santa
alive and grim and well not even wound-
ed 

  the hard lines of his olive-yellow face
relaxed to pleasantry

  seiior you are astounded and the
seaorita too no  was not slain and
you who would have killed me are my
captive but you are curious

   at the first shot  dropped to the floor
for safety they thought me dead you
see how i fooled them my troops
swarmed my lawn like headless game-
cocks i went to the window and called
to them in confidence and love  made
a speech of pardon the tide turned
again seiior i sent into the cellar to
find you - to bring you here in an
hour there will be no more rebels in
rio santa the government will re-
main intact

   let me speak to him for you mabel
whispered to draper  your shoulder
must hurt frightfully and it ought to be
dressed perhaps  can get him to for-
give you

  draper nodded she went impulsively
over to the dictator and spoke softly to
him he looked at her hesitated and
gave some orders to the soldiers who held
n ick they saluted and departed

   you have been interceded for
senor dc rivera joined his finger-tips
and considered draper thoughtfully
 the seiorita has a womans kind heart
i in addition have been thinking you
might have shot me in cold blood you
are honorable seflor i am gratified
see  show mercy and will find a gov-
ernment position for you if you so de-
sire i 

  nick draper hardly alive to his salva-
tion yet thanked him profusely he
gave back miss blake the shy smile she
was bestowing on him

  that was two months ago next week
some there are in rio santa who see
a good old yankee romance ahead who
knows stranger things have hap-
pened

  anyway nick draper can tell you
that cupid goes armed with a mauser

to good housekeepers

     dear madam-

                  a shabby piece of furniture never zooks worth send-
                  ing out to be refinished-it really is worth it you
                  forget that it isnt tlie wood that is worn-it is the

                      finish

                  replace the finish-the piece is as good as new when
                  you do this yourself tlie expense is slight and the labor
                  nothing

                    you must first remove the old finish varnishing over it
                    looks cheap-shiny-home-made

                    the old finish is a coat johnsons electric solvo takes
                    this off quickly easily the piece is then left iu the
                    white--new wood-to be finished as you like

                 choose one of johnsons wood dyes  shades a
                  shade to suit you if too dark add alcohol if not
                 esl dark enough add our flemish oak dye no 

                            youll find the dye thin like water it enters the
                            wood pores evenly - it brings out the beauty of
                            the grain-the lights-the darks

                                     artistic wood finishes

                            you cannot make a spotted ib if you try
                            it contains no varnish to cover the beauty of
                            grain it is a dye that accentuates the effect you
                            want each shade is always the same

                              the finishing is equally simple johnsons
                              i prepared wax is pastelike it is applied
                               vj with a soft cloth it dries instantly

                                 rubbing with a dry cloth then givesa
                           r	velvety protecting finish of great beauty

                        j	the same treatment will re-finish your

                            woodwork and floor this is worth your con-

 in six months from  hens

to the average poultrvman that would seem impossible and when we tell you that we
have actually done a  poultry business with  liens  a corner in the city
garden  feet wide by  feet long we are simply stating facts it would not be possible to get
such returns by any one of the systems of poultry keeping recommended and practiced
by the american people still it is an easy matter when the new philo system is adopted

e

the philo system is unlike all other ways of
keeping poultry

and in many respects is just the reverse accom-
plishing things in poultry work that have always
been considered impossible and getting unheard
of results that are hard to believe without seeing
however the facts remain the same and we can
prove to you every word of the above statement

the new system covers all branches of the
work necessary for success

from selecting the breeders to marketing the

eroduct it tells how to get eggs that will hatch
ow to hatch nearly every egg and how to raise
nearly all the chicks hatched it given complete
lansin detail how to make everything necessary
run the business and at leas than half the cost
required to handle the poultry business in any
other manner there is nothing complicated about
the work and any man or woman that can handle
a saw and hammer can do the work

two pound broilers in
eight weeks

are raised in a space of
less than a square foot
to the broiler without
any loss and the broilers
are of the very best
quality bringing here
three cents per pound
above the highest mar-
ket price

  our six months old
  pullets are laying at
  the rate of  eggs
  each per month

in a space of two square
feet for each bird no

sreen cut bone of any
escription is fed and
the food used is inexpensive as compared with food
others are using

our new book the philo system of progressive poullry

keeping gives full particulars regarding these
wonderful discoveries with simple easy to under-
stand directions that are right to the point and 
pages of illustrations showing all brancnes of the
work from start to finisii

dont let the chicks die in the shell

   one of our secrets of success is to save all the
chickens that are fully developed at hatching time
whether they can crack the shell or not it is a
simple trick and believed to be the secret of the
ancient egyptians and chinese which enabled
them to sill the chicks at  cents a dozen

chicken feed at is cents a bushel

   our book tel is-how to make the best green food
with but little trouble and have a good supply any
day in the year winter or summer it is just as
impassible to get a large egg yield without green
food as it is to keep a cow without hay or fodder

 our new brooder saves two cents on each chicken

 no lamp required

no danger of chilling
heating or burning up the chickens as with b

 over
rood-

ers using lamps nr any kind of fire they also keep
all lie- off the chickens automatically or kill any
that mav be on when placed in the brooder our
book gives full plans and the right to make and
nse them one can be easily made in an hour at

	cost of  to  cents

a few testimonials

  your system of poultry keeping should appeal to
all poultrymen the advantages of your system
are many and the quality of the large flock of

emltry you have raised  your city lot is the
st evidence f its success

  it was my privilege to spend a week in el-
mira during august during which time i saw the
practical working of the philo system of poul-
try keeping and was surprised nt the results
accomplished in a small
comer of a city yard
 seeing is believing
they say and if  had
not seen it would have
been hard to believe that
such results could have
followed so small an
outlay of space time

chances in the navy

          if you have a trade or want a trade
          this advertisement may interest you

   the lniti  states xavy requires electricians machinists
firemen coal passers carpenters shipfitters copper-
sniiths cooks stewards waiters musicians bookkeepers
stenographers men for the hospital corps-in fact men of
nearly every trade in the country are required to operate
the vessels of the v s xavy

   about one-half of a man-o-wars crew are men working at
a mechanical trade  tbe other half being in the seaman branch

   men working at the different trades in the navy liave the
same chance of promotion as tbe seaman branch both iti rank
anil pay moreover if you have a trade your pay at the start is
higher and promotion more rapid

   for example -any machinist who has learned his trade and
is familiar with engines and boilers can enlist as a machinists
mate second class at  and if in addition lie has had one
years experience at sea with marine engines he can skip the
second-class grade and enter the first-class at  per month
kemember-this includes board lodging and medical care you need
spend little or nothing for amusement as the men get up all kinds of
games and sports it is a chance to save many a man has made his
start in life on savings in the navy

   if you havent a trade and wish to learn one the navy will train
you provided its trade schools are not full at the time you enlist if
you have no trade you can enlist as an apprentice seaman and be taught
the duties of a seaman

   the navy department does not wish to urge any one into its
service but for your good and that of the navy it does urge every
young man with or without a trade to investigate and find out for
himself what navy life is and the opportunities it lias to offer young
men most of those who investigate enlist and most of those who enlist
are highly satisfied if you know of any one who has enlisted write and
ask how he likes it

   the navy needs this year about  men-a large percentage of
whom must have trades if you care to look into the opportunities
of navy life send for more detailed information to

      the usjal range of sizes-insures exact fit

                   the only system that gives perfection of fit is the regal quarter-sizc system
              all other shoes limit you to full sizes and half sizes thats why youre so apt
              to buy shoes that are
              either a trifle too loose
              or a trifle too tight

                 regals offer you
 not only full sizes and
 half sizes but in addition quarter- 
 sizes and three-quarter sizes in be-
 tween-twice as many fittings as you can get in any
 other shoes in the world thats why regals fit you just as
 if they were made to your measure give you the height of
 comfort and retain their trim stylish appearance until worn
 out sizes range from xo  for women to no  for men

     this  special alp storm boot for example repre-
 sents the highest shoe quality and it is made just as care-
 fully as the finest shoe for dress wear

     regal shoes are sold directly from the factory o you
 with all intermediate profits eliminated nowhere else in

the good barber says

get a razor that

strops sharpens

 i do not use an tut stropped dull
 razor because it would not shave
 comfortably or cleanly

besides

 doing so would irritate your skin
 giving instead of a shave a scrape
 which pulls and draws

therefore

 i strop sharpen my razor frequently
 so as to shave you properly and leave
 your skin smooth and cool

 maybe youve tried to shave with
   tt	one or several of the different uo-

 	stropping razors anil not having

 the skill or means of keeping them
 stropped sharp have quit in disgust

now however a way out has been found in the

autostrop kazoft strops itself

-placing in your hands a really wonderful expert
medianieal barber

 its self-contained stropping sharpening arrange-
 ment makes the autostrop the last word in
 safety razors

it strops sharpens automatically and being always sharp
gives the well-groomed man what he desires-a delightfully
clean smooth safe shave each time used

it is not unscrewed or taken apart for either stropping

sharpening or cleaning  the autostrop strops itself sharp in

about one third the time it takes to remove a dull used blade

from any other safety razor to replace it with a new one and

	you clean it just as conveniently with-

out taking apart-without unscrewing-

without any trouble at all

autostrop maxim

you lather well and ill shave well

if your dealer wishes to aive you the  square deal  in
safety kaors hell sell you the autostrop or write

       note-autostrop kazors are sold under a guarantee which protects pur-
 chasers absolutely

           this is the guarantee that comes in each box of six
           pairs of holeproof hose if any or all of these
           hose come to holes in six months from the day you
           buy them we will replace them free

           the great success of our mens and womens hose
           has forced us to increase our line

we now make childrens stockings

           these have -ply reinforced knees as well as -ply
           heels and toes so their cost is c a pair or  a box
           of six pairs but once you try them you would pay

           si	if we asked it they save all the darning-they
           outwear many pairs of the best unguaranteed stock-
           ings so the saving in dollars and cents at the end
           of the year makes them the cheapest by far no
           other hosiery equals holeproof in quality

we pay an average of c
per pound for our yam

                      we buy the best egyptian and sea
                    island cotton-the softest and finest we
                    know-regardless of what we must pay

our yarn is -ply we could pay c and get weak and coarse
-ply yarn as others do but you wouldnt buy such hosiery
because it is uncomfortable we are not trying to sell you
wear only buy holeproof for all of the qualities of the best
unguaranteed hosiery-buy it for  months longer wear

this is a fact to note

please learn that the only difference between the best unguar-
anteed hose and holeproof  is that holeproof wear longer

examine them notice how soft and light they are compare
any brand of hose with holeproof then let holeproof
show how they wear

if your dealer does not have genuine hole
proof hose bearing the holeproof trade-
mark order direct from us remit in any con-
venient way and we will ship you the hose and

choose a mattress is to be guided by

 will keep it always pure and clean-theres no wear-out to it

the railroad mans
magazine
will pay for true stories

ailroading in all its phases is dramatic it
is full of thrilling and absorbing stories that
compel interest stories of the sort that
everybody likes to read because they are
true there is hardly a railroad man in the
united states from the general manager to the humblest
section-hand who cannot unfold a story in which he him-
self has played a part a story of danger and daring a
story of courage a story of mystery romance or wonder

   it is these that the railroad mans maga-
zine get one of any newsdealer wants in its pages and
for which it is willing to pay they need not be long but
they must be true and they must be interesting from 
to  words in length and containing names dates and
places

    if you know any stories of this sort write them and
send them to the editor of the true story series
railroad mans magazine flatiron building
new york enclosing stamps if the stories are unavail-
able it goes without saying that they will be returned if
available a check will be mailed to you immediately
upon acceptance each story will be printed over the
writers signature

    you may never before have written for publication
no matter send your manuscripts anyway a true
story writes itself
