whether you shave quietly
and luxuriously at home
or strenuously over the shoulders
of other harassed travelers in a

tively in camp with the cold lake
for your wash basin - no matter
how different the shaving condi-
tions may be-put a fresh gil-
lette blade in your holder and

ing comfort is the careful honing the
dclicatestropping that gillettes mar-
velous machines give every blade
no human hand however expert
however patient or tireless could
ever work such comfort into a blade

  and gillette goes one step further
it sets aside almost half of all its

less search for any blade that may be
below par

  you see eight out of ten men in
america shave with a gillette and
expect every gillette blade to do its
duty so every blade has to be good
no matter how difficult the condi-
tions it goes up against-hard water
cold water tough beards tender
skins slapdash lather-a dozen vary-
ing conditions that affect the com-
fort of your shave conditions change

good reading

 charles houston

  to read a love story from chelsea house
is to renew your youth if you are looking
aghast at the fast approach of middle age or
if you are young yourself here is the mirror
held up for you and your contemporaries

  the following are typical chelsea house
love stories

ttif loves of janet by thomas edgelow
published by chelsea house  seventh
avenue new york city price  cents

  are all artists grown-up children must
they be forever pampered

  certainly janet wilde would have had a
ready yes to these questions at the age
of twenty-three she was busy night and day
mothering her father and what a father
acclaimed by all the critics as the greatest
actor of his time he was at home off-
stage a spoiled baby who had to be waited
on hand and foot by the very beautiful janet

  to make matters more complicated a young
actor just winning his spurs was madly in
love with janet who more out of pity than
anything else responded to his attentions
then of a sudden there came tragedy the
greatest actor made his last bow and janet
was thrown on her own resources in-
stinctively she turned to the stage where she
met adventures galore the telling of which
is done in a pleasingly swift-paced manner

the love bridge by mary imlay taylor
published by chelsea house  seventh
avenue new york city price  cents

  i am not saying that under all circum-
stances i would walk that famous mile for a
book but the love bridge is worth go-
ing right out for its the story of an engi-
neer who has two things in the world that
he esteems above all others-a girl and a
bridge that spans a turbulent western river
all the while that he was bossing the peril-
ous job of throwing a gleaming arc between
two canyons he had in the back of his busy

mind the vision of his girl back home who
would some day be the first to cross the bridge

  and then another girl came out of no-
where a girl dressed in trousers and a flan-
nel shirt like a boys and before the young
engineer could stop her she had swung down
the lone cable above the rushing waters and
was the first of her sex across

  from this thrilling start the book plunges
the reader into a maelstrom of adventure
there arc those who would destroy the en-
gineers lifework and come dangerously near
doing it but always he has for ally that
girl whom he almost hated at first the flam-
ing beauty who swung down the cable

  there was a time when it seemed as though
the maker of the bridge would never see the
wonder of the finished product his enemy
had thrown a bomb which blinded him

  and at the end--but not from us shall you
have the thrilling finish it would be a shame
to spoil it for you by attempting to reproduce
it here

the golden temptation by victor
thorne published by chelsea house
 seventh avenue new york city price
 cents

  here is a man clayton carr so absorbed
in money-making that he has no time for the
finer things of life his wife finally revolts
and he turns to the woman he thinks he loves

  the chuckling fate sweeps him aboard the
most incongruous thing in the world a greasy
tramp steamer rio bound and he is face to
face with grim reality mon vy cant help him
here only integrity of character can bring
him through the scenes which follow until
he returns at last a changed man

  here is at once a moving story and a keen
study of what happens to men and women
when there is a sudden shift in their en-
vironment succumb if you arc a lover of
good fiction to the lure of the golden
temptation

we couldnt
   save a cent

i hadnt received a raise in years and my small salary
scarcely lasted from week to week margaret scrimped and
saved and did all her own washing and housework but the
bills kept piling up and i could see she was always afraid
i would lose my position but still i kept drifting along in
the same old rut

then one day i met tom wilson who used to work right
beside me he told me he was making  a year and had
a nice home in the suburbs a new car and everything i
asked hm how he happened to get ahead so fast oh i got
tired working for a small salary he said so i started studying
at home through the international correspondence schools

that woke me up t told margaret that if the i c s
could help a man like tom wilson it could help me so i
cut out that i c s coupon and mailed it to scranton

    it certainly was a lucky day for me in four months i
received a raise in salary and before the end of the year i
was next in line for manager of my department weve got
a car of our own now and a bank account thats growing
every day

    how do you stand when your employer checks up liis men for
promotion does he think of you is there any reason why you
should le selected ask yourself these questions you must faco
them squarely if you expect advancement and more money

    at least find out what the i c s can do for you it doesnt
cost you a penny or obligate you in any way to ask for full
particulars but that one step may change your entire life

 pounding brass

by thomas h raddall

the radio key appeals to more than the auditory sense

ill kemptons fingers strayed
slowly over the dials tuning in
and out for night had fallen on
the north atlantic and the con-
fused radio voices of the ocean were boom-
ing in with the darkness the phones
-that lay hot and heavy on his oppressed
ears were filled with sound the high
keening of american ships with their
quenched sparks the low metallic drone of
british tramps with their harsh rotaries
clear bugle notes from the canadian na-
tional ships with their easily recognized
synchronized rotaries soft pop-pop-pop-
ping of the germans with their telefunk-
ens japs bound to and from the nip-
pon yusen kaisha piers at new york
hissing away in their own queer code and
sounding-bill soliloquized-like two
christian ops on a drunk frenchmen

easily distinguished by their characteristic
as and es and the funny space between
the first two dots of their fs the fast
and smooth stream of snappy dots and
dashes that flowed from brass keys under
experienced hands the halting stuff spat-
tered with erasures and repeats that be-
trayed the ham on his first trip

  ships that had been loud by daylight
were now an offense in bills eardrums
and myriad others inaudible at tea time
were coming in with the darkness like an
approaching fife-and-drum band or a host
of bullfrogs in a swamp out on the blue
water the six-hundred-meter wave length-
is a pandemonium after nightfall

  there was a step on the deck outside the
cabin and the door opened behind him
 old foghorn  muttered bill irrever-
ently cornin for the time sig and slid


sea stories

a phone off one ear in readiness for the

skippers evenin sparks 

  there seemed to be some hesitation in
the doorway which was strange for there
was nothing hesitant about foghorn hous-
ton stranger still was the trim ankle in
gray silk that appeared over the weather-
board an ankle followed by a length of
si ini leg very different from the skippers
baggy blue one and since the weather-
board was high by a round and captivat-
ing knee a girl stood in the cabin clos-
ing the door carefully behind her

  passengers began bill in his official
voice are never allowed in the radio
cabin

  any messages for transmission
mimicked the lady astonishingly should
be handed to the purser well mr sparks
i dont like your fat old ladys man of a
purser so im delivering my message in
person

  she flipped a sheet of note paper under
the eyes of the annoyed bill

  this will cost you pretty high mut-
tered bill still in the official voice must
be all of a hundred words in it he took
his pencil and began to count the address
struck a familiar chord in him and he
skipped suspiciously from the street and
number of a miss felicia corning to the
text

  having wonderful trip home after hectic tour
yurrup doing paris with mixed party school-
maams more excitement than youd think wire-
less man this boat bill kempton too stuck up
recognize me account i was in pigtails when he
went away sea better looking than used be
but less fond girls almost crab all girls in
party writing steamship company complain as
understood thing all ship officers flirt love

pops

  so grinned bill you are little polly
falkham of the pigtails how you have
growed i didnt know you honest

  miss falkham please said the lady
coldly and id like that message sent
right away

  the grin faded from bills face what
-that

  that she drew herself up to her
slim height and tapped her foot impatiently
and i d o or whatever the correct
radio term is

  he threw the sheet down on the table
i will not he said flatly and why
he snorted because its a fool message
thats why

  is that the reason she asked coldly
or is it because some of your friends on
other ships might hear it going through
and have a laugh at your expense

  he flushed to the back of his neck and
gazed at her with surprised eyes right
you arc pol-miss falkham maam too
many birds  this mans ocean know me
and my mitt theyd all jump to their
keys and kid me

  mitt asked the girl

  my hand more difference in the way
two men make dots and dashes on a brass
key than there is in their thumbprints
after youve been at this game a while
kid-that is miss falkham-you recog-
nize a man by his sending style as you
would by his handwriting

  and of course her tone was caustic
you are thefamous thirty-per kempton
and not to be laughed at considered the
best operator in the service nest-ce pas
thirty-per kempton who can send morse
at thirty words a minute and keep it up
till the cows come home stuck on your
itty-bitty reputation nest-ce pasf just
because youve had twelve years experi-
ence and the lord gave you a rubber
wrist all the green young operators like
this poor little mr turpin of yours look
up to you as a little tin god nest-ce pas

  so uttered bill grimly thats where
you got it

  she bit her lip you neednt kick him
in his nice little blue trousers mr thirty-
per i wormed it out of him thinks
youre the first and last thing that ever
happened once i got him started the rest
was easy

  he shifted comfortlessly in the chair
no need to rub in that thirty-per stuff
polly maam they pinned it on me when
thirty a minute on a heavy brass key was
the frozen limit kinda proud of it 
admit nowadays theyre gettin so they
dont pound brass at all theyre usiii
bugs-cute little keys that make your dots
for you-and theres plenty men hittin
thirty and at that-a sly dig this-
tm no prouder of my title than you are
of this funny nessy-pah you picked up
in paris

  picked up indeed snapped the lady
pettishly i spose you never heard of
schoolmaams being familiar with the
french language

  where is the sister of my grand-
mother bill was in high glee at this
pounding brass



fortunate change of subject is it that
she is under the umbrella stand of the
father of the gendarme oh see the
pretty little horse it is eating of the
cheese of the nephew of the charcoal
burner

  pah said the lady in high dudgeon
will you send my message

  i wouldnt send that declared bill
stoutly if i was a ham makin my first
trip and seein that im the mighty

thirty-per-

  then giving the shapely bobbed head
a toss i shall file my message with the
purser including some additional matter
that ive thought of since and i shall
mark it rush 

  he stood across the doorway with arms
folded have a heart polly

  a heart what do you know about
my heart mr thirty-years-old-and-never-
been-kissed

  not much admitted bill ruefully
you was a leggy lile fourteen-year-old
when i left haileyport

  yes and the day you went away in
your spandy new uniform with the shiny
buttons i followed you down to the pier to
watch your ship sail you were my prince
charming mr roving bill kempton
though you didnt know it but you saw
me on the pier waving my timid little
hanky and you wouldnt even wave back
for fear the other officers would see
fraid cat

  no bill protested honest polly
i didnt realize you was wavin to me i
knew you was the little girl from across
the street and i wondered what you was
doin way down there on the dock
and i pursued the lady whimsically
went home pretending i was the fayre
ladye rosamund and had just seen my
lover off to the wars i pretended so
darn well i couldnt eat any supper and
cried myself to sleep on my little bed
and if i know your mother grinned
bill you got a stiff dose of castor oil
out of the racket

  all of which said the lady letting
whimsey fall with a dull thud isnt send-
ing my message

  ah yes the message to be sure
sighed bill hopelessly

  i will tear it up mr thirty-per on
one condition

  and that is

  she made a disdainful motion of her

nose no need for yelling sir my
condition is that you attend the masquerade
ball to-morrow night in the saloon and
dance with me all evening

  impossible

  she wrinkled her retrousse nose again
possible youre going to tell me that
officers may not enter into the social life
of the ship speak only when spoken to
and all that stuff hooey and likewise
sauce a la pomme you will be provided
with a costume-an extremely appropriate
costume-and a mask and nobody will
know you from a hole in the ground and
as all the girls think youre a woman hater
and ive a bet with em that ill have
your scalp in my belt within twenty-four
hours you shall be my dashing handsome
cavalier

  she struck an attitude unfurled an im-
aginary fan before her face and rolled
her eyes at him over the imaginary top
of it

  bill eyed the offensive sheet of note
paper you win he said

ihe never-to-be-forgotten costume
j ball on the stella maris swung
  swiftly into that giddy height of lilt
and fun that only shipboard parties achieve
costumes by some deep magic of the sea
were contrived of odds and ends in the
space of a few hours revealing a collective
designing genius that would have put the
gesticulating modistes of paris to a green
blush harem beauties hobos sailors
male and female a gorgeous king charles
-a masterpiece the cloak obviously a cabin
curtain thefrilly shirt and lace-edged silken
breeches contrived it was suspected from
borrowed lingerie-hitch hikers complete
with packs farmers colored ladies with
bass voices and clowns many clowns one
of these-and not the happiest-was wil-
liam kempton the baggy suit covered
his uniform from shoes to neck a paper
foolscap wabbled precariously  his head
and a mask cut from a black-silk stocking
of pollys secured him from recognition by
the master of ceremonies-no less than
the dapper little purser himself one by
one a bewildering array of young ladies
was introduced to bill always in a dis-
creet corner of the saloon where he was
obliged by the triumphant polly to raise
his mask for a moment and be recognized
and always wrhen these pouting young
persons asked boldly for dances he told


sea stories

them he was booked lip for the evening
and danced away with polly

  there was dense fog on deck which
proved a damper to sitting out and the
siren was blowing dismally otherwise
the ball was a huge success right up to the
crash which everybody afterward agreed
was nine twenty p m in the midst of
a particularly lively fox trot the saloon
deck slid suddenly sternward and the mot-
ley throng sat down with more speed than
dignity upon the loor the orchestra died
with a wild discordant crash darkies and
instruments flying in all directions a
grinding shock passed along the side of
the ship and abruptly ceased to his
credit be it said that the smoking-room
cut-up a florid person with comic specta-
cles and a braying laugh was the first to
recover  tis but the car he uttered
shakily rattling oer the stony street on
with the dance let joy be unrefined

  but the ship began to heel perceptibly
before the words were out of his mouth
and the next of the smitten dancers
squealed were sinking and there was
chaos

  bill took the companionway in exactly
six strides a performance rendered easy
by the sharp list of the ship he tore off
the mask as he ran-the absurd hat was
on the saloon floor under the suddenly
seated dancers somewhere-but the clown
suit remained to make little turpins eyes
pop as he surrendered the phones to his
chief

  whats up gasped bill running a
keen eye over the log

  dunno said turpin we struck
something on the starboard side and the
engines stopped

  thompson the second operator awak-
ened rudely from a snug watch below
stepped into the cabin struck an ice-
berg or somethin he announced almost
cheerfully

  the squat figure of the swede boatswain
was in the doorway an ape of a man with
great hams of hands and the clear blue
eyes of a surprised child d errial sir
shes foulin d stays

  bill squinted up into the foggy murk
how dye know hose

  ay bin aloft sir ay alius leave a
lid die slack in d halyards-dey shrinks in
wet wedder sir-an ay knowed she must
be afoul o d stays wid dis list

  cant you lower the aerial a few feet

i could take in the slack o the down leads
an keep it steady

  the ape shook its head d halyards
sir dey wont run trough d blocks way
shes listin snubbin in d blocks sir

  bill did some quick thinking she
cant stay that way bose our juice will
leak away into those steel stays-theyre
not insulated damn em theres only one
wire foulin eh the starbd wire the
port wires at the other end of a fifteen-
foot spreader an cant foul so longs the
down leads are taut

  he rummaged in the tool box and pro-
duced two pairs of pliers gotta go
aloft you take the foremast bose cut
away that starbd wire see you thomp-
son stand by to take in the slack o the
down leads when the spreader swings

  the boatswain was in the forward rig-
ging already more like an ape than ever
bill followed suit aft it was ticklish
work in the fog and darkness the mast-
heads were well out over the water and the
aerial with its several hundred feet of
phosphor-bronze wire and stout fifteen-
foot spruce spreaders swayed unmanage-
ably with every lurch of the ship by the
fortunes of war the slack in the halyards
was not enough to sag the spreaders be-
yond reach of the ratlines and by leaning
perilously at the right moment they snipped
the starboard wire at each end simultane-
ously it coiled like a vicious spring and
fell into the dark sea the spreader canted
vertically under the weight of the port
wire swayed a little and steadied as
thompson on the roof of the radio cabin
gathered in the slack of the down leads
the deck felt good to thirty-per kemp-
ton

  the little wall telephone rang the
skippers voice kempton 

  sir

  weve struck an old derelict kemp-
ton i think said the calm voice on the
bridge ripped our starbd side pretty
bad makin a lot of water forward of
the engine-room bulkhead and-just a
minute bill heard him talking to some
one on the bridge kempton the chief
says lies got a foot of water in the fire-
room so youd better get off a distress call
afore the dynamo fails our position is
-got your pencil handy latitood lorty-
five an ten north longitood forty-eight
an eight west yeah

  bill leaped to the apparatus the starter
pounding brass



switch snapped on and the motor generator
awoke from inertia to a howl he clipped
in all the gleaming spiral of aerial induc-
tance to compensate as far as possible for
the lost starboard wire setting the wave-
length changer lever at six hundred meters
he seized the coupling handle and screwed
the primary of his oscillation transformer
hard up against the secondary at which
thompson muttered admiringly atta
boy wave as broad as the ocean wake
em up on every wave from three hundred
meters to kingdom come

  turpin was setting the clips of the spark
gap for high power bill leaned across
him and shoved the motor rheostat to all
out and the motors howl became a scream
he shoved up the generator rheostat to the
limit

  thompson plucked at turpins sleeve
stand by mson he grinned  at
sets rated for two kilos an shes gonna do
five or im a cross-eycd pantry boy

  bill pressed down the key for an experi-
mental dash and dot the watt-meter nee-
dle swung hard over against the stop
broke and stuck there the safety gap
on the transformer arced once a vivid
violet crack of flame

  while she cracks she holds said bill
and commenced his rhythmic three dots
three dashes three dots dit-dit-dit da-
da-da dit-dit-dit

  sos sos hr ss stella maris icxgp sink-
ing lat  n long  w require immedi-
ate assistance kxgo k

  he snapped the aerial switch to the re-
ceiving position the ether fell silent with
the silence of death before that mystic
symbol some distant ships were telling
others to stand by for the distress signal
with the terse qrx sos somewhere a
faint piping said plaintively wo sent
sos qrm hr rpt pse an eng-
lish tramp by the sound of his spark and
a junior operator at the key by the style
of his morse asking who sent sos
interference here repeat please

  the powerful voice of cape race broke
in repeating bills message with his high
wailing spark the piping note of sable
island that sounded like a small brother
to cape race repeated also bar harbor
caught it and passed it on in a treble
whistle the navy boys at new york
called for silence with a peremptory qst
de nah qrt and passed the message

again and the bee droning of cape ma
flung it south the whole ocean stood by
and strained keen ears

  now for the ships muttered bill
out of the silence came the tuneful pipe
of a tube set kxgo de maa

  k snapped the key under bills fin-
gers

  the tube set kd hr lusania 
mls arv ur posx  hrs k
arrive your position eight hours eh
muttered bill not so good maa tin-
ol hookerll be under in thirty minutes by
the feel of her the stella maris vvaj
heaving and falling in the fog swell with u
lumpish motion that was not good his
fingers went to the key maa de
kxgo r tics std bi pse

  little turpin listening to the hissing
crack of the spark repeated mechanically
to himself received thanks stand
by please and thompson the second
operator leaning across the desk grinned
and said

  toujours la politcssc bill mson

  the ship lurched suddenly to her
wounded side as if a bulkhead had given
way somewhere wont be long now
said bill and braced himself to meet the
new angle of the table

  on the deck outside boats were being
cut free of their gripes and swung clear
of the blocks ready for launching stew-
ards were passing out life belts and help-
ing people into them up on the heeling
bridge old foghorn houston was directing
operations in the great voice that was fa-
mous over the seven seas to his chief
officer he said in a quiet voice that was
more potent somehow than his roar get
those port-side boats away mr bellamy
the ship is still safer than an open boat
but i darent hold em any longer theyll
be useless in another fifteen minutes at the
rate shes listin-the port bilge chocks
awash now no more than a boats crew
in em till theyre afloat understand  and
tell those women to wrap up warm the
airs as deadly as the water in this lati-
tood

  bill clamped the phones tighter to his
ears there was a tumult of hoarse voices
and clattering feet on the sloping decks
and much creaking of blocks and falls on
the boat deck outside

 kxgo de kfy sang a musical
spark in the phones

  k snapped bill


sea stories

 hr general washington arv ur
posn  hrs wt happened k

  r tks struck derelict-sinking fast-
getting boats away nw crackled bill

  the stella maris lurched again and the
little telltale clinometer on the wall swung
over to an angle that made them gasp the
lights went out the motor generator ro-
tated a few times under its momentum and
came to a stop bill switched to his
emergency battery

  haul down those motor rheostats
turp he said in the darkness gotta
run the ol mill at half speed to save juice
tommy you tel the old man the nearest
ship is five hours away he turned to
the key again

  listing  degrees he snapped into the
night engine room flooded-lights out
-using emergency-qrk 

  qrk sang kfy cheerfully qrk
piped maa and added ur sigs
weaker though they were getting him
all right then so much for the emer-
gency battery

  there was uproar on the tilting deck
farmers houris hobos and bona-fide sail-
ors and firemen bloated and awkward in
life belts were milling to and fro and
crowding about the few lanterns as if there
might be some intangible safety in those
feeble beams men had been calm and
women had been magnificent till hysteria
raised her ugly head in their midst and
fear had followed in her evil footprints
infectious as the smallpox

  the skipper appeared in the doorway
looking in and down upon them from the
steep angle of the deck

  better come away he shouted you
cant do any more an youre needed at
the boat stations the fireroom gang got
the wind-up when she heeled a while ago
an rushed a couple of boats the lousy
scum

  tommy an turp you go down an
see what you can do bill said im
stickin

  dont be a fool bellowed foghorn
houston from the dark doorway

  good thing he cant see this clown
outfit thought bill

  aloud he said those ships wont
reach us for hours sir an the boatsll be
scattered all over the ocean by then got a
hunch there might be a ship just over the
sky line somewhere that could get here
while the ol hookers still afloat

  huh grunted the ow man why
dont they answer then

  lots of tramps bill said earnestly
only carry one operator irregular
watches see an most tramps only run
their dynamos at night for the sake of the

lights-

  i know nil that snapped the skipper
whats that got to do with it

  -and ranges are greater at night

anyway so lots of tramp ops come on for
a while in the evenin to send the owners
the daily position report im hopin one
of those birds is handy an that i can catch
him when he comes on the air

  sounds like a fool hope to me
grunted the skipper morosely and stumped
away bill heard him bellowing again
lower away easy easy now both
falls at the same rate the same rate
youll spill if you dont fend er off
there or youll smash hey that boats
plug aint in put your plug in put
your plug in its tied to the thwart with
a lanyard  who put those women in with
those crazy fools anyway

  bill was alone in the darkness sitting
on the edge of the table now for the
stricken stella maris was at a violent an-
gle fear was not in him there is no
room for fear where there is pride
thirty-per kempton was at the key and
the whole ocean knew it all the north-
ern ocean straining ears to catch the
smooth and rapid morse that flowed from
the brass key under his fingers the rip-
ple of dots that made an h the swinging
cs with the first dash slightly longer than
the second the trio of dots sliding easily
into a dash that made a v-writing on the
wide ether with a flowing unfaltering
hand at the rate of thirty words-one hun-
dred and fifty letters per minute only
one man on the blue water could pound
brass like that methodically he sent his
calls feeling in the dark ether for the
hypothetical ship over the sky line hold-
ing his wrist like iron the wrist pollyd
said was rubber steady steady as when
swapping greetings with a passing ship
with light to see by and a table that was
right side up

  shes going-slow but sure oughta
write up the log no light though no
log either on the floor somewhere
anything that could slide had slid funny
slapping noise against the wall-which is
more floor than wall water huh
pounding brass



ears goin woozy overstrain slapping
again water sure enough-must be
nearly under the clinometer-strike
a match and look no scared here
goes forty great heavens seems
quiet somehow-everybody gone shout-
ing off to leeward in the fog boats try-
ing to keep touch heres ivfy again

sk very appropriate that sk i

am finished deuced approp-

  the girls voice came astonishingly from
the doorway bill

  calling down into the dark hole of the
topsy-turvy cabin as though the doorway
was a cellar hatch

  my heavens polly you still aboard
wheres everybody 

  gone 

  you an me too

  as he clambered over the weatherboard
he heard the high humming of the motor
drop down the scale to a moan and die
and knew that the water was in the battery
locker at last his head brought up all
standing against a black mass that proved
to be a lifeboat cut clear of its gripes and
hanging incredibly inlxard from the dav-
its the deck was like the wall of a
house

  good he said thickly amid a sudden
constellation of stars and pinwheels you
take the bow here an   take the stem
should be an ax in each end got yours
good if the ol hooker sinks under us
hop in an cut your falls clear minute you
strike water got that yeah if the
ship goes right over were dished but
shes not tippin any farther-an she may
sink on her side this way meantime we
lower away like so atta girl easy
lower again easy little more touch-
in water now down the falls with you
wrap your legs around em and slide
atta girl praise heaven for those harem
trousers you couldnt have done it in a
skirt now when the swell lifts her un-
hook now

  they were adrift bill took a pair of
oars and pulled mightily

  heard a lot of argment kid about

when a packet sinks some say theres suc-
tion some say just a splash me im not
takin chances the heavy boat moved
sluggishly under his single effort he
pulled away for some distance and lay on
his oars the fog seemed to clear in
patches for the stella maris was still visi-
ble a darker shadow in the dark night

  flares in this thing somewhere said
bill he fumbled under the thwart
here they are punch a hole with the
little gadget an chuck the packet in the
water so

  a red glare made a small world for
them and the sinking stella

  shes goin going she was the
ship slid under with a quiet suddenness
that was frightening a swish a deep
gurgling as of a giant bottle suddenly im-
mersed and a splash they were rocking
in the boat alone with the dying flare
and a multitude of bobbing gratings and
deck chairs

     iie girl in the scanty harem costume
crept against him for warmth and
he peeled off the cotton clown suit
to wrap about her pump-clad feet and
arranged his brass-buttoned jacket awk-
wardly around her bare shoulders they
drifted for an eternity out of a long
silence he said suddenly im through
she raised her head from his shoulder
through with what bill

  with poundin brass wireless oper-
atin thought a lot about it lately no
future in it roamin the sea all your life
on watch off watch day in day out sun-
day an monday an when youre all
done what are you just another brass
pounder

  i see there was a vague caress in
her voice

  yeah or some day that he waved
toward some floating riffraff that was
bumping gently against the boat

  she said you talk as though this days
not some day with a little rueful laugh

  where theres life theres hope he
told her but take ol foghorn now
theres a man spent all his life on the blue
water livin an breathin just for his ship
an owners an whats he got out of it
a trip to davy jones

  captain houston wasnt he saved
why i thought we were the last to
leave

  he shook his head with a motion that
was almost a shudder caught a glimpse


sea stories

of him just as the ol stella went under

standin on the side of the wheelhouse in
his heavy bridge coat with his feet wide
apart an his shoulders braced against the
post of the soundin machine as if he
didnt plan to be separated from her ever

  she put her face against the fog-damp
breast of his shirt and sobbed quietly his
arms went about her as though they had
always belonged there tie patted the bare
white shoulder gently

  what are you going to do bill if you
leave the sea

  the change of subject was welcome
why mack doran wanted me to go in
with him polly last time t was in hailey-
port remember mack hes got a radio
supply store down on boyce avenoo thats
makin plenty money for him wants to
branch out an make receivin sets-his
fathers a cabinet maker-with me in
charge of the store ive got some jack
saved away from long trips an a heap
of experience with radio gear an the fact
that ive been a seagoing op wont exactly
hurt me with the customers mack says
a sure-nough seagoin brass pounder could
sell stuff with his eyes shut goes big
with hams

  wherell you live bill the old
homes been closed since your mother died
hasnt it he did not catch the wistful
note in her voice

  yeah didnt altogether like the idea
of strangers in the ol place board some-
where i guess handy to the store some-
where

  she turned her face up to him a white
oval in the dark ill come in sometimes
bill and buy tubes and things

  he kissed her afterward he wondered
vaguely why his head had dropped
somehow and lo there were her warm
moving lips under his funny her
arms white and round stole about his
neck and one hand stroked his rumpled
yellow hair her eyes were closed the
scent of her damp hair was a strange in-
cense in his nostrils queer little thrills
up and down his spine made him arch
involuntarily the muscles of his back

  polly stammered a deep and strange
voice in his chest polly dyou-dyou

think-

  booooooorp ooooorp

  a ship said the normal of thirty-per
bill kempton and near

   the girl sat up silently and leaned away
from him resting her chin upon her cupped

hands what she might have thought he
never knew he took the oars and pulled
painfully toward the sound

  cant be either of those birds that an-
swered my sos he grunted  must a
raised a handy tramp after all

  boooorp-ooooorp the siren echoed
again through the fog so loud as to startle
them

  easy all muttered bill get run
down first thing we know

  a distinct throb of machinery ship en-
gines iunkety-tunk tunkety-tunk pulsing
through the fog and darkness then a
bell sharp and distinct ting-ting ting-
ling ting-ting ting-ting

   eight bells breathed bill kid weve
only been adrift an hour or little more
he fumbled under the thwart for another
flare and hurled the little packet in the
direction of the bell red light flamed as
the chemicals touched salt water showed
them the bulk of a ship there was a faint
shout and a jangle of engine-room bells

  goin astern muttered bill

  a searchlight reached into the fog a
white and sickly finger that swept about
the flare and finally came to rest on the
boat boat ahoy bellowed a voice

  ahoy yourself answered bill stand-
ing up

  can you pull over ere to us asked
the voice

  cornin shouted bill

  the voice addressed somebody as
bosn ordered that person to lower a
jacobs ladder from the well deck  to
stan at the fut of it and to wave a lan-
tern

  in a very few minutes they had the
clanking deck of a british tramp under-
foot the captain turned over his com-
fortable cabin to polly regretting in hon-
est cockney that it wasnt better and ad-
juring his deft little gray-haired steward
in a tremendous voice to see that the
young leddy as everything she wants

  bill found refuge with the english wire-
less man i put my phones on said
that worthy apologetically just as you
sent that last bit about going and i guessed
there was something wrong im aston-
ishin clever at times y know  started
to call but my main transmitting condenser
busted as soon as i touched the key
course i knew from the strength of your
sigs you were right on top of me some-
where and then i heard key checking
pounding brass



your position with maa and-well
here we are

  and very nice too said bill

  how the deuce admired the other
did you send that letter-perfect morse
with your packet on her beam ends

  bill grinned delightedly there were
men on the blue water then whod never
heard of thirty-per kempton it was a
sweet thought bill was an involuntary
king and his throne-that throne of
pounded brass-irked him not a little

  sittin astride the table edge he said
whimsically an reachin down to the key
like a fella on horseback fixin a stirrup
must a looked like a bit of a circus with
that clown suit an all

orning brought the problem of
clothing polly which was solved at
last by a red-faced apprentice who
offered his shore-going clothes she made
a charming boy

  bill was giving the english operator a
hand with the broken condenser

  of course he declared spark setsll
soon be a thing of the past but while
theyre here fella let me tell you these
little ol oil-immersed glass-plate-an-foil
condensers of yours arc a delusion an a
snare theyll bust as quick as any other
an take a darn sight longer to fix
efficient in operation though re-
turned the other quick to the defense of
gear he had cursed for six months
whats better

  glass jars declared bill eagerly if
you bust one slide it out slip a new one
in an there you are two minutes an
youre goin again but this-waving a
contemptuous hand toward the offending
condenser-is a days work to fix gotta
dump out the oil an pull all those messy
leaves apart an then maybe have to con-
nect a spark coil across it to show up the
busted plate never fixed one yet but
what i finished up ravin wild an oil from
truck to keel

  yes the englishman joined battle vig-
orously but what about efficiency in those
leyden-jar things old chap those pretty
blue flames around the edges eh losses
my dear feller losses you dont get that
with the old oil-plate affairs

  all of which said polly a slim and
flushed figure  the doorway is very
technical and dull why not discuss some-

thing interesting-me for instance what
do you think of this

  she strode a few paces along the deck
in a droll imitation of the wide-apart sea-
faring roll swinging her arms from side
to side au mateldt

  best-lookin prentice i ever saw said
the englishman gallantly

  polly bowed her thanks she took bills
arm and steered him to a nook among the
tramps grubby lifeboats

  the captain tells me all the rest of our
people were picked up by the general
washington and lusania

  he nodded absently yeah barrin
those in the boat that upset and the
skipper

  he was leaning against the rails with
his fists jammed into his jacket pockets
with a lock of his yellow hair down across
his forehead and his sea-blue eyes star-
ing far out across the sunlit dancing water
as though the hurrying radio waves were
visible to his inner eye and he could read
them without the aid of man-made appa-
ratus always afterward when she thought
of bill kempton she saw him in that atti-
tude on the deck of the grimy tramp long
after a fickle world ceased to thrill over
the operator in the absurd clown costume
long after she married winslow bates of
the haileyport bank long after there was
a winslow jr and a little polly the
picture flitted through her mind

  he was clearing his throat polly
  yes bill

   member what i said last night
  about quitting the sea

  about quittin

 youve changed your mind-in a
small careless voice

  pie gave her a surprised glance and
looked away again hurriedly

  howd you guess

  she laughed a hard little laugh as
soon as  heard you arguing with that
operator any one could see youd be a
fish out of water in a shop even a radio
shop your hearts all tied up in aerials
and coils and things and no room for
anything else in it-not even a woman
much less doing up parcels with string and
passing them across the counter no music
for you in the wide world but that muzzy
jumble in a pair of head phones is there
yeah he said dreamily poundin
brass kid it gets you

off the virginia capes

uarter master on watch
sound rccall on the whistle
captain steven mcnulty young-
old man of the sea bellowed from
the head of the slip as he came on the
double

  tell callahan to single up the lines and
pass word to mr i janes to get ready be-
low

  a hiss of water and steam came from
the giant chime of the naval tug potomac
the letters pd in the continental code
reverberated three times up and down the
elizabeth river and over three cities sum-
moning a handful of men-the potomacs
crew

  on the charles and the cooper potomac
and piscataqua the rio grande and the
rappahannock the deep blasts of this fa-
mous whistle are still a fond memory to
all old seamen

  captain mcnulty was a commander of
sailormen wooden ships and iron men
or iron ships and wooden men steven mc-
nulty was a respected master mariner
thirty-two years in uniform at sea had

molded his body and his soul into its
mass

  disdaining the short ladder from the
slip the old salt dropped to the white slop-
ing deck of his command

  callahan  we leave as soon as possible
for a wreck off beaufort word just came
in to the yard office and we shall probably
have rough weather outside as soon as
mr hanes gets up steam most of the
men should be back

  yes sir answered callahan with his
hat shoved well back on his graying head
with nearly as much experience at sea as
his commander it was unnecessary for him
to be told to put up weather cloths house
the awnings stow loose deck gear clear
away the towing engine and do all the
other odd jobs incidental to a deep-sea tow-
boat faring forth

  scotch boilers are slow steamers rous-
som black of skin and white of soul knew
just how to slice die fires coal them over
and push them back spread the coal thick
and even and mighty little draft at first
heavy smoke poured from the stack
sky bo williams d g s



  a painted towboat  a painted river
was being transmuted into a challenger of
the deep

  by six oclock a thin wisp of smoke rose
steadily toward the heavens a feather of
steam from the safety valve and a foot-
thick stream of yellow-green water pulsed
from the overboard discharge

  hale grease covered was turning the
engine over slowly working the water out
and warming up for the run a teacup
full of water will burst out cylinder heads
and large masses of metal must be heated
and expanded evenly

  quartermaster how many men are
aboard  called captain steve

  twenty-one sir came the prompt re-
ply

  mr simonds have you enough men to
sail asked the skipper of his first mate

  yes sir my best men are back and
those that arent will not be missed

  is sparks aboard  radio men are
valuable at sea

  yes sir 

  swinging himself up the vertical ladder
to the tugs flying bridge with the ease
of a midshipman captain steve called over
his shoulder

  cast off

  eyes of six-inch hawsers jerked over the
bollard heads on the dock and were
dragged aboard carefully so as not to get
them wet mooring lines are mooring
lines and wet lines rot when stowed

  one long sonorous blast from the whis-
tle told three quarters of a million people
that the potomac was outward bound if
they cared to know

  a rattle of the engine-room telegraph
was answered by a swirl under the tugs
stern pushing the dregs of the dismal
swamp back toward gilmerton locks and
a steel stem toward the open sea

  a stciggering running towheaded boy
raced down the slip neckerchief flying and
hat gone

  come  skybo yelled half a dozen
lusty gobs from the tug jump her

  a blue-clad mass hurled itself into space

  overboard from the tug went a dunga-
reed figure heaving line in hand skybo
came up grabbed a rope-bellied fender and
swung himself aboard the dungareed fig-
ure following many a good man has left
this world between a dock stringer and a
crunching steel plate

  what the hell you goin out without me

for asked the figure in sozzley blue of
callahan

  we cant wait for all the sleepers an-
swered the boatswains mate youd bet-
ter go below change your clothes and sleep
a while too much avon street

  alcohol usually engenders loquacity but
not in disciplined seamen aboard their own
ship the tipsy one born and bred in the
cotton fields of mississippi squdged for-
ward and down the ladder to the crews
quarters ashore like his mates a roar-
ing good fellow aboard like his mates a
seaman

  starboard your helm came down the
voice tube from the flying bridge to the
wheelhouse

  helms starboard sir snappily rung
in the skippers ears

  steady

  steady sir answered the helmsman

  slowly eight hundred tons of brawn and
sinew slid down the river the deep whis-
tle sounded when they met craft passing
up but never a blast for one passing down
the tug overhauled few but her way was
unchallenged in a pull

  all right sailors all you men not on
watch go below and turn in callahan
chased his gang below ahead might be
hours in swashing water hunger and cold
to numbness no ruckus in the forecastle
to-night

  red cape charles light glowed across
the port quarter and steady white cape
henry over the starboard the quartering
swell rolled the sailors in their bunks
knowing even in their slumber where the
vessel should change course their rest was
but shortly interrupted

  captain mcnulty could snore book
captains would have been pacing the bridge
issuing orders but captain steve a smooth
round peg in a neat round hole slept the
sleep of thames street

  ambiguity at the wheel ilcaly so his
enlistment record named him but who al-
ways got leave for yom kippur healy
could judge a mountainous wave to half
a revolution of the wheel and he needed
to with a skipper named mcnulty

  rearing and diving port roll and star-
board lunge they grunted their way toward
the graveyard of the atlantic seaboard
many a man has seen hatteras but 
man knows it as the salvage man does
the lord is not master in that latitude
when it is shut in by a clay-colored dome


sea stories

orntng broke late through the
scuds of rain the wind howled a
gale the barometer was falling
fast-driven clouds brushed the hem of
their tattered skirts on the tugs low reel-
ing mastheads no standing on the fly-
ing bridge for four hours nor even two
hours in this weather lookouts lashed
to the railing were changed every hour

  old jeff twenty-seven years ships cook
sick unto an ashen hue unknown to his
african ancestors managed coffee paddy
bright erstwhile baltimore chef now coal
passer rustled a scouts kettle full of hot
burgoo paddy knew good wadding to
fortify sailors against rough weather

  sail ho called the wet and hatless
skybo from the lookout

  where away came a cflm voice up
the tube

  dead ahead sir a schooner cleaned 
down by the head and awash sir

  sailormen unconsciously acquire the
knack of stating facts without embellish-
ments

  a moments pause while the tug sank
between two mountains crossed the short
floor of the valley and clawed up the con-
cave snarling comber

  another hours leading and feinting and
the derelict stood out-a lifeless hulk im-
aginative artists could clothe the splintered
stubs with sails a poet could weave an
odyssey around that creaking hulk the
navy towboat captain saw only a possibil-
ity of saving life of removing a menace
to navigation

  bracing himself against the flying
bridge captain steve a stubby mass of
baggy oilskins roared down the voice tube
half speed

  bells jangled

  starboard half

  somewhere below a steering engine clat-
tered and the tug headed into the wind

  steady

  quarter speed

  a voice called up from the deck below
can make out two men on the wreck sir
one near the heel of the mainmast and
another down awash lashed to the binna-
cle

  are they alive called captain steve

  cant make out sir but i believe the
one at the binnacle is moving

  callahan get ready to make a shot

  all ready sir

  watch your chance now callahan ill

ease her over a little closer i think it is-
too rough to shoot a line over

  slowly steel slithered sternward in a
boiling sea

  dont go too close to a wreck in heavy
weather unless you have learned how from
experience if you are over twenty-one
years old you will never learn

  stop roared the skipper

  shes stopped sir came up the an-
swering voice

  helm a quarter starboard back half
speed

  all hands were on deck now there was
work to be done and few enough hands to
do it even with a full crew forgotten
now were the double watches forgotten
sleep forgotten grub every one about
the decks was soaked to the hide

  everything was against shooting a line
across the hills and valleys of that roaring
sea no shot could make headway against
such odds

  mr simonds called captain steve
gripping the hand rail with two knurled
paws

  a red-faced figure in a rustling sou-
wester popped a head out of the wheel-
house door just below where the skipper
was standing

  yes sir

  can vou make it with a whaleboat i

  yes sir

  callahan was already clearing away the
gripes skybo and frenchy seaman
and oiler were at the boat falls ready to
lower away on the word feet were shuf-
fling in the gangway swash it takes seven
huskies to man a whaleboat and there were
more than that on deck some one was
going to be left

  jump up here four of you and get
on your life belts called callahan there
was little if any choice among the men
below him and callahan knew he had two
good men to go from their temporary sta-
tion at the boat falls

  no sane man would attempt to scrabble
up six feet of slippery steel with no hand
or toe holds especially when it is careen-
ing over a hundred fathoms of cold seeth-
ing brine a score of men had a fair start
-no handicaps the only precedence was
agility and sinew the first four grabbed
life belts coal passer and oiler seaman
and carpenter-a crew to pull the thwarts
off any kittery-built whaleboat

  the six men some hatless some shoe-
skybo williams d g s



less donned their life belts-the old cork
kind that stiffened a mans guts and warded
off body blows they swung out on the
manropes quietly dropped into the sway-
ing boat and grabbed the oars

  hop out there you skybo and get a
ball of white line callahan called to the
towheaded seaman

  its here

  an end of the ball was passed clear of
all the deck gear and attached to the after
thwart of the whaleboat to be used later in
hauling a hawser to the derelict too
much drag for the small boat to haul across
a heavier line

  firmly gripping the deck-house rail the
mate mr simonds reeled his way abreast
the laden boat souwester off rubber
boots left behind-ugly things to try and
swim with

  gimme a chew callahan

  callahan passed the mate a smoothly
whittled plug of navy tobacco without
comment the mate gnawed off a slug
passed it to the man nearest him in the
boat and it wended a losing journey
much history has been written because of
a good chew of tobacco

  all ready lower away when she heels
over ordered the mate his cheek bulging

  boat falls rove easily out of the flakes
and when the sea willed the oaken shell
with its precious crew dropped swiftly into
the water stoppers were loosened the
bow and stern men jerked the hoofs free
and leaders snatched the heavy blocks
swinging in death-dealing blows away
from the heads of the boats crew

  staggering in the bow of the whaleboat
a thin cherub-faced lad stood tense with
a gaff in hand ready to fend off with
the strength of a young devil he shoved
clear the bow of their frail craft when the
sea thrust it toward the ships steel side

  out oars port called the mate in the
stern

  three ashen blades poised over the
swells

  give away port

  they dipped slowly the whaler swung
away dangling oer the brink of hades

  out oars starboard and give way to-
gether

  seven good likely candidates for davy
jones locker

  straight and strong at the steering oar
stood boatswain simonds a son of the
virgin islands reared in the shadow of

bluebeards castle when danish was taught
in the schools of charlotte amalia to
him fell the duty a plain job

  for the first few minutes the whaleboat
soared and plunged within sight of those
on the tug as time dragged her absences
grew longer steady sweeps from arms
already numbed urged the frail craft to-
ward the wreck drifting hither and
thither the white line rode over the swirl-
ing spume useless to the whaler in case of
trouble

  darkness was falling leaden clouds
shorten the days just get the line aboard
and the job would be done the rest
would be as simple as stowing a heaving
line

  ahead half port your helm roared
a voice from the flying bridge

  callahan break out all your heaving
lines and get them on the after deck house
sea anchor over the side with plenty of
line break out some oil im coming
about have a line on all hands working
about the deck

  every man visible and invisible sprang
to action on the double captain mcnulty
could voice two sentiments at once even
the kinky gray head of old jeff bobbed
out of the galley in the swirl keen for a
chance to lend a hand

  callahan the whaleboat has turned over
end for end captain steve yelled through
the gale when opportunity offered

  heading into a tremendous sea mr
simonds had been outwitted for an in-
stant but the mates wits were very quickly
gathered unto him one by one mr
simonds counted the spluttering heads bob-
bing up here and there dodging tethered
oars frenchy lees chips olliger
bright but where was skybo no skybo
in sight

  a speck far up on the crest of a
comber a bundle of black in a corselet of
dirty gray mr simonds shut his eyes
no one saw but him pray heaven no
one would sec yelling would have been
as useless as table tapping in a boiler fac-
tory

  poor skybo

  knight says a vessel may be turned in
a mountainous sea but at great peril
captain mcnulty did not consult knight
at the moment he made the turn any-
way may as well lose the ship and all
hands as lose seven such men

  slowly maneuvering the tug to wind-


sea stones

ward the old skipper ordered callahan to
let go the sea anchor its line was passed
through the eyes of the ship and back to
the midships chock where it was safer
to handle a little sternway on the engine
lowered the towboat slowly against the
pull and the wide-mouthed canvas bag
filled with water and retarded their drift

  they settled back toward the overturned
boat no one spoke there was a man
aloft gripping the bridge rail who could
take care of that

  heaving lines were carried aft and when
the tug approached heaving distance cal-
lahan secured an end of a life line knotted
about his waist to a towing bi-tt and scram-
bled through the swashing water in the
short quarter-deck to the grated fantail
there were enough men in the water now

  mistah callahan im passim you de
heavin lines and here you frisky you
an beavers haul in de no counts mind
you flakes em right or  bust yo head wid
a cleaver fore we passes de nun buoy
bareheaded aproned jeff thomas wash-
ington jefferson ships cook

  no need of a life line for jeff his bare
feet each covered thirteen inches of three
teak deck planks and he could pick up a
ten-pound can of tomatoes in the span of
his fingers

  carefully dividing the tarred line just
enough in the right hand and just enough
in the left callahan tested the balance if
you dont get the right lay in making a
heave youli foul and fall short

  a tattooed arm whipped out hempen
coils rolled into the air and the heavy
hexagonal nut embedded in the wall knot
drew the line out straight and it fell fair
across the upturned keel nerveless hands
snatched it-a thread of life

 mr simonds managed to hook the
whaleboats painter with his stockinged toe
with one hand he knotted the line from
the tug keeping his weight on it spring-
like to ward off the snapping jerks of the
sea when it was tied he waved to cal-
lahan

  slowly with jeff bossing the men on
the towboat hauled in the line hand over
hand as callahan eased it over the stern
rail steadying himself between the surges

  when the whaleboat with their clinging
shipmates was about fifty yards astern of
the potomac another heaving line was
floated out attached to a life ring tick-
lish slow work

  mr simonds caught the ring with his
toe and motioned the nearest man to grab
it there was no time to argue no place
for hero stuff slowly frenchy was hauled
up under the tugs weaving stern calla-
han gripped about the waist by jeff
reached down for the little oiler watch-
ing the swells callahan grabbed and
flopped him aboard the instant the stern
swept down

  one after another the men in the wae
were brought aboard the tug until non
were left but paddy bright erstwhile bal-
timore chef and mr simonds again the
life ring was floated back

  those on the tug saw that mr sim-
onds and paddy were conversing paddy
ducked under the water where had he
gone after what seemed to be an age
the coal passers head bobbed back and he
held a line in his left hand callahan
looked at captain mcnulty standing above
him on the deck house

  theyve got a rolling line on her sir
well try and hist her in

  no one had a thought of the small boat
being government property just a damn
good whaleboat old issue kittery built

  paddy came over the counter next shins
skinned pink and clean from the knee
down his cheek still bulged with a chew

  again the life ring was floated back and
off came mr simonds who just missed
being crushed under the stern by an angry
sea releasing his hold on the life ring
a couple of wiry strokes propelled him a
hairs breadth from death and as the stern
settled he virtually stepped aboard

  skybos adrift sir reported mr sim-
onds to the skipper

  too bad and captain mcnulty an
older man staggered his way forward
along the heaving deck

  for reasons far removed from ancient
theology men have much cause to love
their fellowmen words are common to
all a shell is but a memory but guts are
guts

  the darkness of ilades enshrouded
them nothing could be done but pull
away from the wreck and lay to until day-
light

  below decks during the lull mr hanes
had dragged out canvas and spread it on
the engine and fire-room gratings where
it was nice and warm the coarse dirty
folds made fairy-soft beds for the sodden
sailors
skybo williams d g s



  old jeff soaked to his hide staggered
about with a scouts kettle full of sizzling-
hot bean soup ladling it out to his boys
yes sir skipper mate chief engineer
and all-all his boys no one but jeff
knew or cared how he managed to cook
over a dancing galley range

  skybo was missed no one spoke of
him yet the very ship crooned his name
and the wind mourned skybo through
the rigging

  with her engine barely turning over the
potomac headed into an angry sea all night
-just steerage way not enough to move
her far from her task

orning broke at last one by one
tired stiff aching bodies came to
life clothes dry and stiff eyes
caked with salt hair like hogs bristles a
slug of hot black coffee and to work again

  all hands were out to look even men
who had toiled mo-st of the night per-
haps some one would see skybo or worse
what had once been skybo

  some one moving aboard the wreck
sir called macfarland from the wheel-
house

  captain steve narrowed his little slitty
eyes perhaps mac saw and perhaps he
didnt yet macs eyes were younger and
might be better

  theres a man braced against the taff-
rail sir came from a sailor perched on
the engine-room hatch

  captain steve joined callahan near the
after end of the deck house

  see if you can signal him callahan

  the boatswains mate braced himself
against the mainmast and extended both
hands aloft the attention signal of the
navy semaphore the figure on the wreck
answered with one hand

  tell him well float over a line or-
dered the skipper

  watch for floating line was slowly
spelled and repeated across the waste

  the figure on the wreck waved back
was the message understood or was he
just waving to bolster his tense hopes

  sail thread and plenty of it de-
manded the old salt

  a sodden seaman reached up two balls
of stout cotton thread callahan attached
a large cork to an end of the ball and
tossed it into the water applying a light
coating of grease as the thread passed
through his hand the wind and the

waves forced the cord with the thread
attached back and forth yet always toward
the wreck half an hour and the first ball
was gone the light thread having been
driven this way and that over an area of
perhaps a half mile in width surely one
of the parts would strike the derelict a
second ball was bent onto the end of the
first and started paying out slowly

  when this second ball was nearly gone
there came a jerk-a bite and a human
one

  he has the end sir called callahan
and the figure on the wallowing wreck was
waving frantically the drowning man
had truly grasped a straw

  bend on the white line ordered the
captain

  a roll of cotton twine as large around
as a knitting needle was quickly attached
to the sail thread and the skipper waved
to the figure on the wreck the white line
was drawn over the side of the tug slowly
at first as the sag was taken up in the
thread then faster faster until the reel
ran smoothly the end of another ten-
pound roll was hauled out inch by inch
until it was nearly gone it stopped pay-
ing out altogether and the hand on the
wreck again signaled

  small line said the captain and a
sailor appeared with a coil of light hempen
line about as thick as his knotted little
finger but strong enough to hold the weight
of two men-strong enough to haul across
the towing hawser

  again the boatswains mate signaled
across to the crusoe and slowly the small
line running freely over the side sank
in the angry green seas this was going
slower-a heavier drag through the water

  after an hours hauling the figure on
the wreck again gesticulated

  bend on the hawser hes a man if
he makes it said the old skipper his
face tense

  two men on the wreck now sir called
macfarland from the wheelhouse mac-
farland was right before

  it was torment to the men on the tug
to glimpse those poor devils pulling their
lives out on the plunging wreck

  hours dragged by and the leaden pall
was again settling on an angry sea
healey with three hours sleep since leav-
ing the dock took the wheel

  hes waving again sir

  every muscle aboard relaxed


sea stories

  thank heaven said the skipper
standing bareheaded facing the wreck

  hes taking the line aft sir macfar-
land bawled from the flying bridge
theres a man for you

  a long breathless wait

  hes waving again sir and i can see
the hawser tending over their stern

  make fast callahan and put chafing
gear on the line roared the old skipper
through the gale the sight of the work
on the rafted hulk braced him like a glass
of strong liquor

  canvas and marline were wrapped over
a couple of fathoms of the hawser and a
heavy coating of grease was applied to the
wrapping to prevent the line from weak-
ening with constant friction on the tugs
steel stern rail

  captain mcnulty reached for the signal
cord to the engine room and above the
roar a gong clanged once

  steady he bellowed over his shoul-
der and the word was relayed through the
gale to the man at the wheel

  slack came out of the hawser with the
increasing strain the gong clanged
again the engine was stopped and slowly
the line straightened

  tell mr hanes to go ahead very
slowly

  thrusting his head in a porthole mr
hanes passed word to the greasy machin-
ist at the throttle the big engine was
barely turning over

  tell him to increase his revolutions
very slowly sir and again word was
passed to the engine room

  ever so carefully hanes drew back the
throttle it was no time to part a towline
now

  callahan set a watch on the line and
all hands turn in said captain mcnulty
as he headed forward mr simonds set
her on a course to cape henry ill re-
lieve you as soon as i have a cup of java
and then you may turn in

  all hands obeyed silently

  again the tired dirt-and-salt-incrustcd
sailors swallowed bean soup and sagged
down a man went to sleep behind the
ash hoist and awoke near the boiler-mak-
ers chest he could roll in and out of
hell and not awaken

  poor old skybo thought the old cap-
tain left out there off hatteras too
short a span between the county home and
just the grave he would have chosea

hen morning broke it found them
in what looked to be the same sur-
roundings nothing told of their
nights passage but the revolution counter
and a growing pile of ashes on the floor
plates below

  over the tugs fantail now up now
down could be seen the wreck being towed
ignominiously stern forward would she
hold together were the poor devils on
her still alive

  about noon the barometer started to
rise steadily and the sea began falling
off the swells were longer now but best
keep out plenty of line

  by the end of the afternoon watch the
sky broke scudding clouds hurrying like
gulls to the eastward showing a setting
sun

  morning burst in a glory over a pleasant
sea fresh water was issued and blessed
baths

  you who dally an hour in a porcelain
tub squared by white tiles know not the
elixir of a bath get out on a surging
pure-white deck a bucket of warm fresh
water and a deck hose running from the
clear cool sea cold  sure  rub down
to the red dress and have two strong men
bring on the grub

  noon and calm with currytuck light
standing seven miles off the port quarter
the capsized whaleboat having been
righted and none the worse for wear gayly
shot its gleaming whiteness from side to
side astern

  mr simonds we had better shorten
tow and you can drop back to the wreck
said the skipper to his mate

  callahan took his place near the after
towing winch two men were removing
the badly worn chafing gear and soon the
dripping hawser was being hove in over
the stern with all hands making it down
in the gangway until the wreck was about
a hundred yards astern the line was
made fast and the chafing gear applied

  with a lively cadence the whaleboat
bobbed its way back to the wreck in
half an hour it was returning and slowly
regained the tugs side all of the crew
were leaning over the towboats rail

  hy skybo yelled captain steve from
the top of the deck house  a shadow lifted
from his weather-worn face

  what a jargon went up epithets and
anthems old skybo alive

  drawing alongside mr simonds held
the whaleboat fended off from the guard
of the tug

  i have two gentlemen here from the
wreck sir reported the mate guests
first

  soon two badly twisted and bruised
blobs seemingly held in human form by
their tattered clothes were spread on the
deck house for the doc to look over

  pretty bad sir reported the hospital
apprentice many bones broken they
should be gotten into a warm bunk right
away sir

  give a hand here men take one of
them to my stateroom and the other to
mr simonds ordered captain steve

  mr simonds was preparing to hoist in
the whaleboat sitting on a stern thwart
skybo remained smoking a cigarette the
first in years it seemed

  slowly the boat was raised dripping
from the sea was swung inboard and
dropped into its cradles clumsy tender
hands helped skybo to the engine-room
hatch an arm and a leg swollen and use-
less

  whats this skybo captain steve
demanded with gruff kindness

  i got a hell of a bump sir

  the butt dropped from his lips and
robert lee williams slumped down

  captain mcnulty said the hospital
apprentice at his commanders side the
man in mr simonds room wants to see
you sir

  helping hands rough and sea cut were
making skybo more comfortable

  captain steve hurried forward

  a wan stubbly figure was stretched out
in the mates bunk

  i am sorry and i thank you sir
names george wilkes captain of the
schooner john iv pickles of portland
maine brunswick to bath with naval
stores old hull and too damn much
weather all at once youre a good sea-
man sir that man washed aboard from
your ship is a good seaman a damn good
seaman came aboard with an arm and
a leg broken told me his head was all
right and mine wasnt he was right be-
tween us we hauled over your line and
secured it but i dont remember much
before or since some one rigged a stop-
per and chafing gear on it twant my
mate he was unconscious and your man
sea-

hauled him below out of the weather first
thing and lashed him below damn good
seaman your man

  thank you captain wilkes you just
take it easy now and get a good sleep

  captain steve drew the curtain aside
and stepped out making his way aft
along the deck house

  where is skybo mr simonds

  aft on a tarpaulin sir he wants to
see you

  a group of squatting men around the
prostrate figure on the stained canvas drew
back captain steve knelt down nearer
the dirt-splotched pale face

  skybo captain wilkes in there says
youre a damn good seaman im glad
youre on my ship i shall recommend you
to the secretary of the navy for promo-
tion

  skybo waited a moment

  what to sir

  to coxswain

  another pause a fellow had to have
a chance to think

  this tug doesnt rate a coxswain sir
id rather be a seaman and stay on your
ship sir

  captain mcnulty pulled his visor down
jamming his hat tighter on his bowed head
slowly turning from the scene he wended
his way forward down the companion-
way into the crews mess room in a corner
of which was the ships writer

  let me see williams record he de-
manded

  the yeoman riffled through a thin bun-
dle of manila-bound pamphlets selected
one and passed it to the officer

  pen and ink demanded the old salt
without looking up

  in a boyish hand the skipper slowly en-
tered the name of the vessel and the date
in the proper columns next c r-
change in rating-he penned the following

by lawrence g green

a pilgrimage by sea

trange craft said the trader
at duncans table they come
down on the northeast monsoon
and clear off again and no one
knows much about them

  the steamers anchored off beira were
dark shapes against the crimson of sunset
as the dhow came sailing wearily upstream
a relic of earlier centuries-that was the
way duncan saw her where do you
think shes from he asked eagerly
watching her beating against the current
with the hot breath of the african river
just filling her tattered lateen sail

  the trader shrugged india persian
gulf arabia-thousands of miles anyway
they were coasting east africa long be-
fore the portuguese the same crazy-look-
ing type of ship black ivory they carried
in the old days-slaves and gold made fine
cargoes i dont know what brings them
now

  duncans imagination stirred the tin-
roofed houses of beira on their spidery
wooden supports the loafing sundown
drinkers at the cafes-royal palms and chat-
tering black humanity all faded out the
tired dhow making for harbor with her air
of mystery was like an elusive shadow
from the east falling into the sweltering

gold of the african evening duncan had
traveled far to hear the sort of talk this
trader gave him his escape from the
life sentence of the eight fifteen and his
daily task as shipping clerk seemed long
ago though it was only three months
since he had started happily to follow the
rich freights he had so often sent away
he had sought romance deliberately-
sought that intangible thing which cannot
always be brought within a mans experi-
ence by the mere chance of a legacy and
a pocketful of travel tickets

  so duncan had found since leaving trie
ledgers of fenchurch street for the
coasts and backwaters of africa reality
had been disappointing seamen  the
decks of steamers in the thames had sug-
gested more romance than any sight 
story during his journey

  he had wearied his soul in pursuit of
his ambition traders officials hunters
engineers all the flotsam of the tropics
found themselves speaking frankly to this
earnest young man the straight eye be-
hind the spectacles-those tragic spectacles
which had thwarted the sea career of his
young dreams-invited something more
than the usual cynical gossip of the white
man in the land of the black yet africa
had revealed nothing but railway lines and
cement villas and telegraph poles where he
had expected some glimpse of adventure
or ancient mystery the natives wore
cast-off khaki tunics days of travel
brought him to places which bored him
after an hour the victoria falls were
nothing more than a torrent going to
waste rhodesian ruins that would have
enthralled scientists were only heaps of
rock an african stonehenge without a
living present to link up with a dead past

  drifting east to bcira he had that day
seen a lion shot on the golf course out-
side the town no thrills in this experi-
ence one neat shot and the lion had
gone down like a great tawny dog if
he could have heard that lion making a kill
in the far-away bush roaring its triumph
through the silence of the african night
he would have been satisfied but he was
still on the fringe still trying to thrust
aside the veil of the commonplace which
covered the things that were worth while

  then came the dhow duncan followed
her to the creek where the dugout canoes
of the swahilis were the stay-at-homes and
the dhow was a true sea rover come to
rest from her hull now rose the acrid
smoke of a wood fire he could see an
aged man with a green turban and a thin

beard the red glow illuminating the seams
and wrinkles of his olive face this
plainly was the master he sat with his
legs crossed gravely waiting for his crew
to prepare the evening meal

 duncan marveled that such a vessel
should cross the ocean without disaster
her slender mast leaned aft drunkenly
supported by crude fiber rigging there
was a great clumsy rudder and tiller and
her planks were rough-hewn balks of ma-
hogany a roof of palm leaves sheltered
the stern but cabins she had none greasy
black water covered her bilge smelling of
such a variety of tropical cargoes that it
would have been difficult to distinguish
any one of them on the splintered tim-
ber of her bows stood a name in arabic
el salaam-the peaceful

rgjhoughtfully duncan strolled
j away to his hotel he was still fas-

- cinated by the picture-the medieval

ship with her inscrutable arab master and
the old secrets that surrounded her at
dinner he tried to make his companion-
a prosaic scottish engineer-discuss the
dhow trade along the east african coasi

  aye theyre mysterious little ships ad-
mitted the scot they put into creeks
that the steamers never visit and they cer-


sea stories

tainly cover enormous distances if a cy-
clone sinks a fleet o them we hear nought
about it here their cargoes dont figure
in the trade returns and the portuguese
dont worry them much for papers and
suchlike

  duncan wandered out again through the
sandy streets of beira to dream over the
dhow when he reached the rickety wharf
where she was moored the arab master
was still on deck a lantern swinging
from the boom made his golden slippers
shine and revealed the chessboard over
which he was meditating surely an in-
tricate problem duncan decided to rivet
the attention of a player whose ancestors
understood chess before the crusaders
brought the game back with them to eu-
rope he drew closer to study the pieces
for chess was his own game just as ro-
mance was his absorbing quest

  no-the knight now exclaimed dun-
can involuntarily as the arab made a false
move checkmate for the arab had
taken the advice that came suddenly from
the dark wharf and the problem was
solved now he peered toward the voice
saw the hesitating figure in white drill and
rose to smile a welcome

  sayid bin omar invites you to a game
he said in slow english the double hand-
clasp of islam two cups of exquisite mocha
coffee and they arranged the pieces of
carved ivory for the contest in the bows
the swahili seamen were crooning a song
of the tropic ocean from the native
quarter sounded a fast crescendo of drum
taps and all around the frogs of the creek
were singing their staccato chorus from
overhead the menacing whine of the fever-
bearing mosquitoes filled the muggy air
a strange setting for the play between
the young englishman and the aged arab

  they struggled with sharpened wits for
mastery until the cafe lights vanished and
the swahilis had spread out their mats
under the moon to sleep when it was
all over sayid bin omar smoked his hemp
with slow relish and spoke of his voyages
then duncan knew that his own roving
had not been in vain

  for the wanderings of the dhow el sa-
laam described by this seawise old navi-
gator woulcl have made a page of arabian
legend isles of birds and turtles where
no man dwelt she had visited her anti-
quated hull had rested for a night off an
island inhabited only by packs of wild dogs

that had lost their barks not a coral
atoll from the red sea to madagascar that
this nomad had not lifted during her years
of restless odyssey

  sayid bin omar silently observing the
excitement in duncans eyes made his
narrative more real by unfolding a creased
parchment covered with old-fashioned
names-names that have long vanished
from modern admiralty charts some
were portuguese like sofala and st
miguel but most were arabic bestowed
by early explorers out of muscat fore-
fathers of sayid bin omar yet when he
had scanned the chart from bab el man-
deb to pemba duncan still did not know
why the dhow had come to beira or where
in the maze of queer names she would
presently sail

  they tell me there is little for dhows
to carry since the slave trade was stopped
and the gold mines of qphir passed to the
white man he said at last what
freights do you find now

  sayid bin omar pondered supposed
you sailed with me he suggested his
far-seeing black eyes fixed on duncans
face could you look back only on a dream
and never speak of wrhat you learned 
ill promise that replied duncan sol-
emnly he was so plainly honest that the
arab with his penetrating sense of char-
acter held out his hands

  a promise is a debt quoted sayid bin
omar we leave on the tide to-morrow
-and there will be time for many games
of chess as we sail north thus was
the compact made between instinctive
friends

hhe el salaam it seemed had put
into beira only to replenish her water
jars while the morning was still
cool sayid bin omar steered downstream
for open sea

  enchanted duncan watched his own
civilization drop astern a bugle shrilled
somewhere in the brown upper works of
the b i liner calling the passengers to
breakfast strings of lighters were send-
ing load after load of copra into the holds
of a paunchy clan boat there was a
deserted sailing ship with yards untrimmed
and rigging slack a portuguese tug with
a large red-and-green ensign burning bad
coal native fishing craft rocking in the
estuary then the last buoy came abreast
and the el salaam lifted to the offshore
sea mecca



swell that smelled keenly salt and promised
liberty after the heat of the river port

  with the drone of a southerly wind in
her sails the dhow was now alive and
filled with a purpose a sense of direction
fresh strips of green coast appeared here
a white beach and there an island with its
tuft of palms northward through the
reef-scarred ocean swung the el salaam
timbers creaking their song of wide oceans
bows falling with gentle hissings into the
warm rollers duncan stared and listened
until he felt himself being lulled into tune
with the rhythm of this new world

  at noon savid bin omar found the
suns altitude with an astrolabe of polished
wood that probably came out of some
looted portuguese three decker the
swahilis had speared a sleepy turtle and
there were yams and bananas to round off
the meal

  faint smudges on the horizon showed
the tracks of the coastwise steamers the
dhow sailed in the pale-green shallows
with the sure hand of her master taking
her clear of sand spits and coral reefs but
never far from land once duncans curi-
osity forced him to ask when they would
sight the place-that unknown and secret
harbor-for which the el salaam was
bound

  do not count the days of a month
which do not belong to thee spoke savid
bin omar the fatalist and indeed it was
not hard to be patient on that sunny
friendly sea

  day after lazy day of blue and gold of
chess and eastern wisdom poured into
western ears night after night of brilliant
tropic stars duncan sometimes wondered
how the dhow would fare in one of the
sudden cyclones that ravage the east afri-
can coast but it was plain that such
thoughts never troubled savid bin omar
there are no devils save imaginary dev-
ils he told duncan-a creed which dun-
can immediately decided to take back to
his old life when he returned

  sayid bin omar sailed fearlessly draw-
ing his philosophy from the koran and the
religion of islam each morning before
dawn he summoned his crew to prayer
with a deep call of allaho akbar in
the evening when the sun touched the blue
sea rim he would act as priest again and
reverently duncan would watch the line of
moslems facing mecca dropping to the
deck with their foreheads touching the

woods kneeling until the last words were
chanted peace and the mercy of allah
be on you

  the compass on board the el salaam
had only eight points but on that primitive
card and the mercy of allah sayid bin
omar placed his trust while it was dark
one morning the dhow turned her bows
from the coast and headed toward the faint
line between sky and sea then sayid
bin omar spoke

  when the sun lights the water this day
you will see the end of our voyage he
announced you will know why the
dhows still cross the ocean to reach this
coast it is a revelation which you must
always carry behind the closed doors of
your memory because of the promise you
made now it will be necessary for you
to dress as an arab i know that you
will not betray us but my brothers may
be displeased if i bring a stranger to the
secret lagoon you must be careful-and
silent

  duncan draped himself in cool white
robes the sun had tanned his lean face
but he stained it darker still and covered
his fair hair with a turban

  your eyes are too blue declared
sayid bin omar take these dark spec-
tacles then studying the change in his
guest he gave his approval now you
might safely visit the tomb of the prophet
in mecca

  when day laid open the color of the
living scene duncan observed a fleet of
dhows all shaping courses toward some un-
seen spot ahead the climbing sun re-
vealed their destination it was a long
dark line seen now and then through the
spray that rose from each wave crest-a
line that became more firm gained depth
and detail and finally became an island of
coral with groves of coconut palms and
a cluster of huts dominated by the faint
uplifted finger of a gold-tipped minaret

  the secret harbor of the dhows said
sayid bin omar pride in his quiet voice

the el salaam sailed close under
le lee of the shore duncan discov-
red that the island was shaped like
a horseshoe with one narrow break in the
pink barrier the reef lay so low on the
emerald of the water that he could see over
the coral into the lagoon beyond here
many dhows rode at anchor-two hundred
at least with sails stowed and men stirring


sea stories

busily on their decks between the dhows
and the beach glided scores of canoes

  sayid bin omar put the helm up for the
entrance in a moment the ocean swell
had passed and the el salaam was picking
her way through the crowded anchorage
the anchor splashed into water so clear
that duncan observed the flukes gripping
the clean sand on the floor of the lagoon
in this sheltered harbor no typhoon could
play havoc with the arab craft

  duncan was longing to feel the land
underfoot again after days of endless mo-
tion and when sayid bin omar left the
dhow he went on shore with him a fine
sight the beach was-a clearing house for
all the riches of the tropics stacks of
ivory the tusks of long-dead herds so
sayid bin omar explained when an
elephant is dying after its hundreds of
years in the forests of africa it goes
pounding across country to one of the
lonely graveyards of its kind white
hunters never find these immense stores of
vague legend only the natives know and
they barter the precious relics of the jungle
with arab traders to the secret harbor
of the dhows comes the ivory to be shipped
to those craftsmen of the east who carve
it back into the monstrous shapes of ele-
phants

  great heaps of spices-rarer and costly
spices beloved by the wealthy epicures of
persia and india piles of ebony and
sandalwood stores for the dhows about
to embark on the long ocean passage to the
north limes and rice for them fruit to
ward off scurvy fresh vegetables and
meat not in liverpool or marseilles
could the urgent task of preparing ships
for sea have been carried out with more
intense vigor

  under a palm avenue an eastern village
had grown up a mosque and white houses
with overhanging balconies green jalous-
ies and flat roofs for evening meditation
here duncan in his silent wanderings
found several markets in one pearls were
being sold-pearls such as cleopatra might
have envied pure crystals with rainbow
tints and black gems shot through with
radiance in another a throng chaffered
for pearl shell-the greenish mother-of-
pearl that decorates the thrones of sultans
the lagoon duncan learned was a bed
of shell where tough swahili divers filled

their sacks in the seaweed forest fathoms
down sharks did not often enter this
ring of water but there were giant clams
that shut suddenly and trapped a man who
carelessly touched their sensitive mouths

  duncan was about to pass through the
arched doorway of another doomed mar-
ket building when he felt the restraining
hand of sayid bin omar on his arm in
there t dare not take you whispered the
arab you have seen how we trade-
that must be enough

  one tantalizing glimpse duncan had
and then he was forced to hurry after his
guide in that second or two he had seen
a tense crowd grouped round a gigantic
pair of scales

  sayid bin omar after long reflection
on the way to the dhow turned to duncan
one more game of chess one more meal
together my friend and we will sail back
to the coast

  and that night the el salaam dropped
the secret harbor under the horizon and
headed for a port where steamers load
their cargoes with cranes and winches
not pearls and unknown treasure but un-
romantic copra hides and coffee

he night swept past them and dawn
revealed the coast for duncan it
was a night of longing and regrets
and puzzled reverie only in memory
now could he recapture the romance of
those glowing days and throbbing mo-
ments sayid bin omar had given him he
tried to thank the old arab as the dhow
came to anchor in a creek below the town

  sayid bin omar listened with a smile in
his fine sea-wrinkled eyes it will be
good to read a letter from your cold land
in the north he murmured a letter is
half a meeting now i will answer the
question you have not asked and he
told duncan of the treasure that was being
weighed in the last market-of the gold
from the ancient workings in the african
bush

  peace and the mercy of allah be on
you said the arab as they parted
through a mist duncan watched the dhow
vanishing into the blue distance-back into
an age which has not changed since the
days of solomon strange craft-slaves
and gold made fine cargoes

on the martin vas rocks

great deal and although that boat might
mean the difference between life and death
to sniah he tried to be unconcerned about
it and refused to be excited

  it was plainly a ships boat he tried
to catch a glimpse of a name they usu-
ally had them painted on either bow or
stern in black letters no name showed
at all the sides were just white where
the paint had held and he judged that the
boat had been in the sea for a long time
to get so sea washed a broken line the
painter trailed from the breast hook in the
bowr that line alone told a story for it
was dark and looked rotten with age it
had evidently been submerged for a long
time until the hemp turned color a num-
ber showed in black on one side of the bow
and he had a chance to read it it was
no  that was all but it confirmed
his original idea of its being a ships boat
it was small boat no  and it was coming
ashore

  but the surf was very heavy it was
always heavy here on the martin vas

chapter i

     awney sniah watched the
wrhite thing come slowly in
through the surf when it rolled
over and over in the rush of foam
he saw at once that it was a boat a ships
boat the craft rolled sluggishly in the
slatch between the seas and was thoroughly
swamped down to her gun whales when
she lay on her keel and only showing a
white side when turning over no oars
no bottom boards showed near her she
looked as though she had been in the sea
a long time for her paint was dull washed
off almost showing spots of bare cedar

  sniah pondered watching her he sat
in the shade of a coconut tree and stretched
at ease his bare legs lying in the soft
warm sand it was no use to hurry mat-
ters the boat would come in on the
beach soon when it was washed up in the
surf no use going out to it and hauling
it up on the sand until it came all the way
in it was too hot to exert oneself a


sea stories

rock about twenty-odd miles northeast of
trinidad seven hundred miles distant
from the coast of brazil the nearest conti-
nental land trinidad was a cable sta-
tion but it was too far off to signal and
almost out of sight even from the top of
the rock-the isle upon which he was
marooned the martin vas rocks
stretched away for miles into the deep
southern ocean out of the path of ships
only whalers came in at times and took
aboard turtles and water

  trinidad had been the subject of contro-
versy at one time it was the island baron
itarden-hickey had declared himself king
of but as his subjects were giant turtles
and sea birds he had never taken up resi-
dence thereafter the british had used
it as a cable station and it was visited at
intervals in calm weather the martin
vas rock upon which sniah found himself
was not very distant from trinidad island
but as he could not swim the distance he
might as well have been upon the moon for
isolation he had been upon the rocky
islet now for six months subsisting upon
a sort of bean which grew on the higher
parts where the land was fertile birds
eggs and turtles turtles were large and
plentiful and were unafraid

  the greatest trouble was that strf it
rose like a wall at all times and rolled
shoreward upon the shelving coral ledges
which stood out like dark or white teeth
in the bursts just a little way from the
rocky shore the steady breath of the
southeast trade wind swept the ocean and
before it rolled the slow but powerful sea
unending seas and the deep thunderous
roar of the southern ocean had filled his
ears until the dull roaring diapason be-
came part of his life the surf was al-
ways both strong and dangerous

  he watched the overturned boat now
with this in mind lie would only venture
out into it after he craft had come through
the worst of the seas and was in shallow
water

  lying in nearly twenty-one south lati-
tude this trinidad is not the island under
that name where asphalt exists in a huge
lake the asphalt trinidad is another
place entirely

  sniah had just reacted from a wild and
passionate outburst and he watched the
sunken ships boat furtively hardly real-
izing that what he saw was real he had
stood on the rock top each morning now

and with hands thrown upward implored
his gods to rescue him from his situation

  save me-save me before i go mad
he would implore the blue sky above him
and the dull roar of the southern ocean
thunderous and sustained was like the
chorus of a litany of a powerful follow-
ing which gave his prayers amen

  and here was something which after
months of prayer looked like an omen of
help of succor his prayers would per-
haps be answered after all he rose nd
throwing his naked arms high above his
head screamed his prayer again for help
and again he was aware of the dull thun-
derous roar which followed upon his re-
gained attention he must help himself
so without further hesitation he flung aside
the garment he wore about his waist and
made his way down the rock to the edge
of the sea

  the coral ledges swarmed with sharks
he must be careful yet he must not al-
low that boat to get in broadside to the
beach and crash down too heavily or it
would soon be matchwood it had appar-
ently not struck any of the jagged teeth
of the outlying rocks his rock had a
shore line of a few hundred fathoms run-
ning almost straight with a pure-white
coral-sand bottom which ran clear up to
the edge of the clifflike face of the rock
and upon which a boat could be hauled
with room sufficient to keep it from smash-
ing headlong into the rock itself

  the steady bursting seas had ground
this sand out of the coral centuries of
pounding and rolling shoreward had ham-
mered it down to a hard surface over
which the last inshore breakers swept up-
ward and foamed and roared through
this he must steer the foundered craft
and by the aid of the upsweep of the seas
he would finally haul and drag it clear and
right it then it would be but a question
of launching her again properly and keep-
ing her afloat until he drove her outside
the coral reefs which surrounded the rock-
proper he could go free far away on
the horizon he could see from the top of
his rock the dim blue ragged outline of
trinidad he thought this bit of ragged
sky line was probably the continent of
south america for he had no way of find-
ing out just where he was and trinidad is
about five miles long which gave it a siz-
able appearance

seas were quite moderate this day and
she was lifted over two dark outlying
points without hanging up on the outer
reef then it was just a question of wait-
ing until the scend of the seas the sweep
of the inner breakers would wash her
ashore sniah waded in until the seas
broke over him and followed the boat
slowly along the sandy shore there was
apparently some slight current for the
boat drifted clear down to the end of the
rock before he dared venture out for it
it might go past and so on out to sea
again this dread roused him to sudden
action he pushed his way out and swam
a few strokes to grasp the bow just as a
breaker swept over

  luckily he seized the trailing painter
and with this in hand he swam back to
a footing and hove desperately upon the
line slowly but surely the boat swung
toward him and he made headway to the
shore a sea swept over again and hove
the craft well into shallow water sniah
now seized the bow and swung it around
toward the beach pulling with all his
strength a following breaker swept the
boat up until in its backwash the keel
struck solidly and as the water receded
the swamped craft fell over on its side
and allowed plenty of water to wash out
of it sniah saw that the bottom was in-
tact that there were no holes burst
through and with mighty efforts he
hauled on the painter taking it to a rock
pinnacle and getting a turn to take up the
slack another sea filled the boat again
but he managed to heave her up a few feet
farther in the wash of foam

  after half an hour of this kind of work
he had the satisfaction of seeing his find
now almost clear of the undertow on the
shore and he made the line fast and got
to work getting the water out of the loat
after that he dragged and hove making a
few inches at a time and finally he worked
the craft up high and dry above the wash
and righted her upon her keel he had
worked for a couple of hours and was hot
and tired but he only stopped to get his
wind back while he examined his find she
was a ships boat all right and quite small
-probably a dinghy for going ashore in
for she was only about fourteen feet long
whereas a whaleboat was twice that length

  he was glad she was small for a whale-
boat would have been too much for a man
alone on that shore in tropic weather a

small boat was as good as a large one when
it came to standing an ordinary sea and
wind he knew he would be able to launch
this craft again and go free he would
not be in too much of a hurry there were
specially calm days when the surf was not
bad for a small boat but he would make
sure for a wreck would be fatal to his
chances yet he would not leave the boat
on that narrow strip of sand too long tt
might breeze up and sometimes the surf
broke clear over it and that would smash
the boat against the rocky cliff

  he went dutifully to the rock top and
knelt down with bowed head and in the
sunlit silence gave prayers for his find
prayers for his rescue and rising up
again he threw his hands aloft with a
wild gesture facing the blue void overhead
through which the little trade clouds trav-
eled slowly toward a goal which was never
attained

chapter ii

awney sniah had been second
mate of the rio grande the passen-
ger steamer which had burned and
sunk just north of the river plate some
months before this the boatload of pas-
sengers and seamen-there had been
twenty-six of them altogether-had been
thrown ashore on the martin vas rock
during the night with a heavy sea running
and half a gale blowing out of the trade
wind they had run for miles for days
and this had been their end-a crash in the
dark and the rolling surf in which they
had all drowned except the second mate
and a young couple just married and on
their wedding voyage the young man
from buenos aires a mr warthier was
an argentine of german parentage and
his girl wife was american both were
young not over twenty-two had never
been away from home before and had
never been exposed to any hardship

  they had made a shelter with sniahs
help at one end of the rock about a quar-
ter of a mile from where the second officer
elected to stay but as the rock was small
they came in daily contact and often ate
their meals together sniah doing most of
the producing of food he had saved a
knife a hatchet and some line from the
wreck of the whaleboat also some matches
in a waterproof case-but these had long
since been used up and for three months


sea stories

they had been without fire as fire is the
most essential thing next to food for casta-
ways they had degenerated to eating raw
turtle meat drying it in the sun until it
was almost like leather fish also they had
been eating in a sun-baked state and with
the peculiar beans which grew high upon
its rocky crests they had managed to live
somehow without quite starving to death
turtles abounded and laid eggs enough to
supply a regiment they buried them in
the sand of the shore where they were
easily found and dug up the knife was
rigged into a fish spear and sniah found
it easy to capture fish in the shoal water
the turtles were rushed when on the shore
and turned over on their backs where they
were dispatched at their leisure a big
turtle would often weigh five hundred
pounds and the steaks were cut and dried
out in the hot sunshine until the meat was
not unlike the jerked beef of the pampas
it was not a satisfactory diet but it had
kept all hands-the three-alive and now
had come the small boat the possible
means of rescue

  as soon as sniah had the boat far
enough up to be safe to leave alone he
made his way down to the eastern end of
the rock to notify the pair of his luck
warthier could help him with the craft
even though the fellow was soft and un-
able to do very heavy work the two
could launch it on a smooth sea and the
girl could be placed aboard there were
 oars  sails and it would be a ques-
tion as to how they would give the craft
headway enough to make that twenty-odd
miles to that distant blue and ragged line
which told of land in the southwest trini-
dad looked of course like the island it
was but they hoped that it might be part
of the mainland they had no idea of
their whereabouts except in a general way
sniah had traced their course northward
without compass or chart for their boat
had been equipped with neither the dis-
aster had occurred in the middle of the
night and the boats had become separated
in the darkness then had come the
squalls and bad weather driving them
along before a wild sea which gave them
no choice but to run before it

  warthier was sleeping when sniah ap-
proached the rocky shelter made of stones
the girl was out on a projecting ledge ly-
ing in the sunshine her body more than
half nude because their clothes had long

ago given up the fight against the weather
and constant use sniah was clad in a
loin cloth and his bare chest and shoulders
were burned as brown as mahogany from
exposure he was a very strong man well
muscled up a good athlete and a very able
seaman he was forty and grizzled and
he always kept aloof from the pair whose
privacy he respected he had been a good
officer and knew his position regarding
passengers even under the existing con-
ditions he felt that he must consider their
welfare first he hailed the girl from
a rocky shelf above her

  ive got a boat-well go as soon as we
can get away he called loudly

  got what answered the girl raising
herself partly and gazing at him

  small boat came ashore a while ago
and ive hauled her up on the sand well
get started as soon as we can-get over
to that land there he pointed at the
distant blue outline of trinidad

  the girl sprang up and stood on her
feet she had a beautiful full figure
browned and smooth in the sunlight she
had kept her health a short skirt made
of her dress and helped out with grass
reached to her knees sniah thought her
beautiful a magnificent naiad of the rock

  ill call walt-what she said

  yes get him awake and well start
making something to navigate her with and
sail away said sniah

  warthier was a large blond boy more
than six feet tall his father had been
academic the type of german who is most
efficient in certain lines of business wal-
ter had been brought up carefully in rather
luxurious surroundings they called him
walt he had married alice renshaw a
week befort starting on the fatal voyage
which had ended disastrously for so many
of the rios passengers with the rest
he had sailed from the argentine for lon-
don bound for paris to enjoy a somewhat
prolonged honeymoon he had come
through the ships disaster alive-the burn-
ing of the vessel and also the wild night
in the small boat the ship had been
posted as lost with all hands pieces of her
upper works having been found in a partly
burned state and now after six months
on a desert rock seven hundred miles from
the mainland he was still alive

  surrounded by the warm ocean the tem-
perature of the rock seldom changed more
than a few degrees during the entire year
the lost boat survivor



clothes were not a necessity except to pro-
tect the body from the sun in the shelter
built of broken stones and thatched with
brush and grass walt lay sleeping in a
garment made from the wings of gannets
and man-of-war birds a weird and some-
what startling costume but answering the
purpose of a skirt

  his wife aroused him with the news of
the second mates find sniah lived down
at the other end of the rock a full quarter
of a mile distant and together the three
made their way toward the sandy shore
where sniah had hauled in the boat there
were a few palms growing along the edge
of the surf coconuts seldom grow back
from the shore they are often washed
about for a long time and floating come
in on a sea and are swept up high enough
to grow in the sand of the high-water
mark

  they were of little use to a boat for
they could not be fashioned into oars
the trees or growth of the upland part
of the rock which extended for several
acres high above the sea in a sort of
plateau were almost equally useless there
was nothing that could take the place of
tough pine or spruce for oars and the
single hatchet and knife-which was used
as a fish spear-were hardly tools that
would work the gnarled and knotty
growths yet something had to be done
and at once

  sniah had saved some of the wood from
the wreck of the rios boat and had been
using it as a roof for his shelter down at
the other end of the rock one board-
a bottom board more than a fathom long
-was shaped quickly into a sort of paddle
a side plank was chopped into a rough
sort of blade for walt to use forward
with one paddling aft and another for-
ward sniah thought he might make the
distance to the island which showed on the
horizon

  the strong brisk southeast trade would
be well to the eastward just now and that
would bring the wind aft he knew he
would never be able to drive the craft
against a breeze and sea with the almost
useless gear but with a following sea and
fair wind he would be able to steer and
cross the breeze somewhat with it on the
port quarter

  its a chance but i vote we take it
he said

  yes bo do i said walt anything

to get away from here before we starve or
go crazy

  yes said alice but i remember not
long ago you said that you would be happy
with just me on a tropic island far from
any one-just us two she smiled the
remembrance

  we had never tried it then grinned
her husband but if you want to ill stick
here with you and let the mate go for
help

  not so youll notice it any said the
girl i care a lot for you walt but after
all we are partly civilized you know-and

just love-love in the raw- well its

all right perhaps in books but im strong
for a dress and proper living well go
together or not at all

  sniah smiled at them he was ready to
go at once but it was better to wait a
little they went to the beach where the
boat lay and there they cut a few branches
of a tree for poles and a couple of sections
from a coconut palm for rollers to run the
boat down the sand quickly their be-
longings were not many and they were
thrown aboard then they waited until
sniah decided what to do

  the trade will die down toward eve-
ning said he and thatll be the best
time to run her off well watch for a
smooth a slatch and try her and see can
we get clear soon as we get her off well
run well to leeward of the reefs and then
its paddle all night the missis can sleep
in the bottom of the boat but well have
to make it go during the dark when the
sun wont hurt us so much itll be cool
enough and eight or nine hours of pad-
dling will do the trick all right can you
stand that much

  sure i can-ill have to anyhow thats
all there is about it im tough enough
when it comes to a pinch said walt

  water of course had been their great-
est trouble the water breaker of the
rios boat had floated in and for days
they at first subsisted on what was left in
it afterward they found a depression in
the rocky plateau which held rain and this
foul-tasting and guano-soaked stuff they
had been forced to drink it had rained
often and they had scooped up what was
the least foul and kept it in the breaker
more by luck than anything else had they
lived for they seldom had a weeks supply
ahead

  the rock was at times covered with


sea stories

gannets gulls and man-of-war birds and
the presence of the strange human animals
did not in the least deter the birds from
nesting and hatching out their broods
this fouled the entire top of the rock but
they had finally managed to keep a sunken
place clean enough to catch water fit at
least to maintain life they had become
accustomed to eating a dozen or more raw
fresh eggs daily and this probably did
much to quench the thirst caused by the
torrid -sun it was an almost liquid food
they piled a few hundred turtle eggs and
a like amount of birds eggs into the stern
sheets of the small boat and now waited
for the breeze to slacken and allow the
surf to die down a little this would not
be much but they could not take chances

  the turtle eggs had the usual leathery
skin or shell and would not break easily
these with a lot of dried turtle beef
would last them for several days the
water breaker was filled and placed aboard
they were ready long before dark

  about sundown the breeze slacked off a
little and sniah decided to try for it the
rollers were placed under the keel and the
three took hold of the gunwales walt and
his wife on one side and the mate on the
other they shoved the boat down into
the sea and waded out holding her against
the wash of the inner breakers standing
up to their armpits then sniah gave the
order and all shoved with their full
strength and climbed aboard the two
men grasped the poles and shoved her out
into deep water then paddled furiously
for the open sea beyond the reef she
went clear but shipped plenty of water
they were off

  with the quartering wind they headed
for the distant land beyond the horizon
and soon settled down to steady paddling
alice bailed the water from the boat and
soon they were going dry and safely to-
ward a new world

    chapter m
he sperm whaler georgia hope
was cruising to windward of trini-
dad island and had about filled two
or three more fish would finish her loading
for the years cruise and she would start
for her distant home in new bedford
massachusetts in the united states cap-
tain greene her commander was well sat-
isfied with his luck and his only fault
just at the present was found with bill

spurling his efficient mate who had lost
a small boat they had been towing two
whalers astern going slowly along under
topsails and fore-topmast staysail and the
captains dinghy had been tied fast to the
stern of the second whaleboat the three
boats towing easily in the smooth sea

  the georgia hope was almost full up
with sperm oil and as there was only stow-
age space aboard for half a hundred more
barrels they lowered all their boats when
they struck into a school of blackfish
blackfish are not large but they are proper
whales and a good big one will net a few
barrels shooting them with the harpoon
gun was like shooting mosquitoes with a
shotgun all boats that would hold men
were lowered and every one who could
throw an iron went into that school

  mitka jarns of the mates boat threw
three gun irons in rapid succession into
three blackfish he had all three pulling
at various angles and almost lost his boat
the other boats shot and threw irons into
a dozen more fish killed and buoyed their
carcasses and still went after the school
which swam slowly away toward trinidad

  that night after all boats had been ac-
counted for the ship had enough cutting
in ahead to fill up entirely the boats
were allowed to tow astern and the dinghy
was made fast to the last boat only two
of the boats were hoisted in on the davits
there had been five boats out and three
were towing when a squall struck the ship

  bull spurling was a proper mate but
as the ship was almost ready for the run
home he had tried to wear out worthless
gear while lying around in the martin vas
grounds where the winds were steady and
not too strong he had allowed the fore-
topsail parrel to chafe a lot on the yard
for lack of chafing gear the groaning of
the tye block aloft should have warned him
that while there was plenty of oil on deck
there was little aloft and when the squall
struck it had a strong puff in it the fore-
topsail came aback and the parrel jammed
the halyard was let go but the yard would
not come down on the cap

  hard up on the helm-hard up yelled
the skipper who had jumped on deck at
the outcry the wheel was put hard up
and with the main-topsail still full and the
fore-topmast staysail pulling the ships
head was swung off and she was run to lee-
ward while the fore-topsail threshed and
thundered and threatened to split in half

t
the lost boat survivor



however it soon filled and with the sail
half lowered the ship went through the
sea at a good nine knots with the boats
towing astern on taut lines and riding on
their heels with the rush the light from
the try-works showed a weird scene it
was not nearly daylight yet and it was
spurlings watch on deck the crew
worked oil watch and watch during good
weather after a catch

  up on that topsail yard one of you
bawled spurling get up there and clear
that parrel

  a man sprang into the weather ratlines
to obey he carried a good-sized piece of
blubber in his hand for grease in the
light of the try-works the little gold ear-
rings in spurlings ears shone and glinted
against the hairs of his face and neck he
was an angry mate and his vocabulary was
something loud and grand expressive and
articulate

  the men at the halyards hove strongly
to start the jammed gear the topsail tye
parted and down came the yard in a mass
of thrashing canvas and jerking lines
luckily the man going aloft had not
gained the yard he was safe and clung
for his life

  glcw up the main-topsail roared the
skipper all hands there-weather top-
sail brace-ease the sheets 

  meanwhile the ship having run off be-
fore the wind was in no danger whatever
but the towing boats were pulling hard on
the towlines by the time the men aloft
had cleared up the mess and spurling had
worn out his voice one of the small boats
wras missing this was the dinghy which
was towing at the end of the line most
of the blackfish blubber had been sent on
deck being cut in before midnight and
very little oil was lost by the time the
breeze let up and all hands had a chance
to look about them

  hows she head now asked the skip-
per of the helmsman when he came aft
again from the fracas

  norwest three quarters west sir said
the man

  thatll bring us right to trinidad about
daylight said greene to spurling
heave her to again in about an hour and
let her drift well cruise about in the
morning and pick up that boat and then
stop off at the island for water and wood
before we start north

  aye aye sir said the mate but if

you would only throw away a lot of that
rotten gear youve got aboard we wouldnt
have this mess that boats painter was
rotten-or it wouldnt have parted

  whos buying this gear-you or the
owners snapped greene

  well you hold me responsible for it
and that aint fair when its no good
countered spurling

  aw i havent said anything-yet have
i hoist them other boats in and look
to their lines before you trust them astern
-thats all

purling backed the main yard
just before sunrise and the georgia
hope lay hove to riding easily in
the trade swell her boats were hoisted in
and after breakfast greene laid a course
athwart the wind to cruise to and fro on
a line to leeward of where the dinghy
would most surely be far to leeward a
bluish line ragged and hardly discernible
rose from the horizons rim-it was trini-
dad island after breakfast the try-works
were taken down and the bricks thrown
overboard the ship was almost full up
and would boil down no more whale blub-
ber the false deck where barrels had
been worked was also torn up and piled
away for dunnage

  xhe whole deck was cleared and worked
over all day by one watch and the other
spent their time aloft reeving new gear for
the run home old braces were sent down
new ones rove off old clewlines were sent
into the shakings bag and new ones sent
aloft even the old topgallant sail on the
main which had done duty for more than
a year was now sent down and a new
one bent for the run home

  all the time this was taking place
greene was sending the ship back and
forth across the wind while keeping a
lookout for his small boat the man 
the masthead lookout where he had spent
so long a time looking for whales was now
looking for the white sheen of the dinghy
her white sides against the deep blue of
the tropic ocean but the day ended and
the boat was not sighted greene stood
about on the port tack and let the ship
drift slowly all night and the next day he
again stood back and forth looking for
his boat he was gradually working to
leeward and the island now showed
plainly it was also now plainly a case
of lost boat


sea stories

  its strange where that blamed boat
could have gone to said greene on the
second day of the search

  well it was blowing right hard-she
might have gone faster than you think
for she was mighty light anyhow we
wont find her now shes either sunk or
gone far to leeward maybe she fetched
up on this here island its almost dead
to looard of where we was at said spurl-
ing

  well stand along to-day and if we
dont sight her well go in and get our
wood and water for the home run said
the skipper

chapter iv

uring the first night sniah and his
two passengers paddled fast and
hard to gain the distant land they
had seen they were almost to wind-
ward of it but still had a little southing to
make it was easy to head a true course
by remembering to keep the wind on the
port quarter the wind coming from the
southeast steadily would mean that the
boat was making better than west she
would have to make a nearly westerly
course to be sure of hitting the island but
as the wind had been well to the eastward
and at one time that afternoon well up to
east by south sniah had only to use due
caution and keep the wind as well forward
as the boat would run with of course
they could not go to windward with those
makeshift paddles

  they could keep her going with the
wind but not either against it or right on
the beam-it must be far enough aft to
send her along and not retard her at
night the land was quite invisible but it
was cooler to paddle and there was really
no cause to believe that the wind would
shift

  that is what must have happened
some of those small squalls like what had
made trouble for the georgia must have
sent the wind a few points to the south-
ward anyhow in the morning the sun-
rise showed sniah and walt that they had
passed the land they had headed for and
were now to leeward at least five or six
miles sniah threw up his hands as he
stood in the bow and prayed aloud

  paddle fool dont stop to pray yelled
walt from his place aft

alice awoke from where she lay in the

stern sheets and gazed about her in alarm
they were indeed in desperate straits-
to leeward of the land and with nothing
but the light paddles to drive the boat up
against the wind and sea which was now
running strong and regular with the breath
of the trade

  i prayed for this boat-an i got her
said sniah ill pray for help and ill
get it-you see

  man pray all yon want but dont
stop paddling sang out walt and he
drove his own paddle fiercely into the wa-
ter and tried to force the boat ahead and
to windward

  they had really gotten well to leeward
of the island but right to leeward there
was little or no wind and sea this made
matters better than they had hoped for
still five or six miles distant the island
stood high and forbidding hazy and blue
in the morning light the sun came up
red and tinged the cloud banks a rosy hue
the high table-land of the rock could be
seen now and it was giving them shelter
the boat was going ahead slowly toward
the land coming in from the northwest
or lee side and sniah saw that he would
probably make it-gain the land after all

  the horror of an open boat seven hun-
dred miles from land with little food and
no oars had struck him forcibly and he
had as usual prayed for help but he
was not a man to give up to prayer alone
he dug in his paddle and strove mightily
and together they sent the boat slowly
along the birds eggs in the stern sheets
had been smashed in the surf but the tur-
tle eggs being of a leathery covering
were fit to eat they all ate them and
chewed turtle beef washing it down with
water

  it was now seen that there must be a
relief neither of the men could stop
paddling for if the bowman stopped the
boat would swing off if the stern man
stopped the boat would not steer after
an hour with sweat pouring down from
their faces and the sun high enough to
burn they decided that mrs walt must
do her share she was set to paddling
aft to steer the boat and now they took
turns relieving each other this gave the
one relieved a chance to get his wind and
cool off for a little in the main they held
to the job and paddled steadily

  they paddled for hours-for days it
seemed but the land apparently stood

d
the lost boat survivor



away miles distant they were growing
exhausted by the time the sun rose
overhead and it was noon walt gave up
and dropped in the boat

  take his paddle mrs alice take it
and go along slowly-were getting in
and thats certain cheered sniah the
wife took up the labor and kept on

  as a matter of fact sniah knew he was
nearing the land at last the wind was
dying away the sea had already gone down
to a gentle swell and he knew that he was
being sheltered by the high and forbid-
ding shores of trinidad the high clift-
like sides seemed distant but that was an
optical delusion they were really now
within a few miles and suddenly they
could make out the trees and also deep
gullies in the rocky walls the hazy blue
of distance now took on the green of tropi-
cal verdure they were coming slowly in
by afternoon even sniah had to give up
for a time they let the boat drift while
they rested and they were not three miles
distant from the reef running alongside
the shore sniah figured that with three
more hours of labor at the rate of at
least a mile an hour he would be right in
the breakers

  he was mightily cfieered and spoke
feelingly to walt

  aw im all in-i cant do any more
said the young man im not hard like
you are

  yes butyou used to say walt that
oti could live with me on a desert isle and
be more happy than anywhere else on
earth said his wife you havent quite
made good i bet mr sniah could have
stayed and won out with his girl

  lady said sniah i would be glad to
go back and live with you on that rock
through all eternity but that is not for
me-im not cut out for a married man
say listen mr mate you seem to
get rather personal-cut it out-quit that
line of stuff  i dont quite approve of it
said walt peevishly

  i meant nothing but what i said
answered sniah you know im not a
trifler i have done my duty to you both
-havent i 

  oh sure but cut out that marriage
stuff with alice here-too personal said
the young husband harshly this is no
time to be flippant

  listen son i dont mean to be flip-
pant said sniah

  walt was too exhausted to continue the
quarrel he took up the bow paddle again
and both men set to and drove the small
boat forward toward the distant shore
an hour of terrible work under the blis-
tering sun and the surf was visible it
showed bursting high against the coral
reefs which lay outside the island proper
there was now almost no wind at all on
this lee side of the land and the boat made
faster headway through the smooth swells
which rose to a towering height and burst
over the coral in a smother of foam the
sound reached them plainly now the deep
dull thunder of the sea breaking over that
reef sniah watched cautiously to try
to go through it would almost certainly
mean an upset and a swamped boat to
remain outside was not to be considered
it was now late in the afternoon and they
would have to get in by dark or stay out
all night

  they paddled steadily slowly but surely
in and they came in close enough to see
plainly that the surf was high and strong
in spite of the lee

  we are all good swimmers said
sniah i think we had better rest up a
bit and then run it make a good try and
go as far as we can we canswim the
rest of the way and be ashore at all events
what do you both of you

  im too tired to do much in a strong
sea said walt and im sure alice cant
do much either

  well we cant lay off here said
sniah thats sure

  im good for what you two are said
mrs walt with finality i can swim with
either of you-perhaps better i vote we
go in and go right now

  well eat what we have left first said
the mate if she turns over there wont
be anything more until we meet some one
there might not be any one on that blamed
island anyhow its nothing but an island
and its not more than five miles long by
the looks of the shore this old sheath
knife of mine and that hatchet are not
much to hustle grub with

  they ate heartily of the dried turtle
meat and sucked what eggs they could in
spite of their rawness then they drank
all the water they could hold and calked
the breaker so in case it came in they
might find it again and get more out of it

  the sun was sinking low in the west
when they started for the outer surf which


sea stories

was breaking about a quarter of a mile
orffshore between it ami the beach was a
foaming stretch where ragged heads broke
through the white and where swimming
would be exceedingly dangerous

  just as they started sniah stopped pad-
dling and suddenly stood up in the bow
look he yelled

  just around the headland of the island
a tall shape came slowly beneath the
white canvas showed the dark hull of the
georgia hope she was fully five miles
distant but she was heading off before
the wind and coming around the point at
a fast clip she was running to leeward
and would soon be right up with the boat

  that settles it well stick right along
out here yelled walt

  thats luck indeed said his wife i
hope they see us and pick us up

  what did i tell you said sniah

  oh blah-you give me a pain said
the young man

  pain hell said sniah ive prayed
for a ship and ive got one

  oh have it your own way said walt
but remember to keep this boat right in
front of her i want her to see us before
dark

  shes coming around to leeward and
will certainly lay off the land to send in a
boat looks like theres no harbor vsaid
the mate

  they paddled easily to just keep way on
the dinghy and have her heading to cross
the path of the oncoming ship

     chapter v

he georgia ran down to trinidad
to get aboard her wood and water
greene had given up all hope of find-
ing his dinghy and he decided to waste no
more time hunting for it the oil from
a dozen or more blackfish he had recently
killed nearly filled his cargo and he was
now going home to new bedford he
had his try-works overboard and his decks
cleared and there were new sails aloft
altogether the georgia was not a bad-
looking ship and would look better by
the time her chief officer mr spurling
had gotten through with her he would
dress her up properly polish her down
and paint her from trucks to water line
before she reached the latitude of cape
hatteras

  just now he was busy with the watch

on deck handling canvas and looking for a
place to leeward to make a landing on the
island he knew perfectly where he was
trinidad was on ail admiralty charts but
the surf was too heavy to try to land to
windward and the ship had been run off
before it to go around to the leeward side
of the island where the surf would not
be so high it was growing late to make
the shore but the ship could lie off the
land under easy sail and send in her boats
at daylight land is not a pleasant thing
for a deep-water sailor to get close to un-
less he knows for sure it is to windward
of him in the darkness

  mitka jams the harpooner of spur-
lings boat was on lookout he was an
old whaleman with a keen eye

  go aloft there and keep a sharp look-
out for that dinghy said the mate its
a chance that she came to looard and ye
might see her before dark

  i am der zeeadler-yes sir im der
zeeadler-vot you call der sea eagle yes
und if dot boat is afloat mr mate i see
ut said mitka as he went into the fore-
top to look about spurling could hear
him singing ih a low tone just a murmur

      whack fol der riddle diddle

      shoot im in der mittle

      he vos der goot mans but hes gone-
      det-det-det

  spurling smiled mitka would see any-
thing that floated within ten miles

  weather crojack brace yelled cap-
tain greene now then mr spurling
stand by to brace her sharp on the larboard
tack when we come around that head im
going to run her close in under that land
and see if theres a decent place to send in
a boat some surf what

  the men took their places and hauled
the ship swung up  the wind until she
was well to windward of the rocky coast
then swung off again and with the wind
well aft ran down along the rocky shore
line to look for a landing the shore line
was clear just high seas breaking and
the foam flying until it formed a slight
mist which obscured nothing greene set-
tled down his topgallant sails after furl-
ing the lighter sails and then under top-
sails managed to navigate along the island

  she moved ahead slowly now under
topsails and the setting sun shone upon
her canvas the loose upper canvas belly-

             sea-

n
the lost boat survivor



ing out in the breeze into great balloons
looked like captured trade clouds the sea
under the land was smooth but still the
swell caused the heavy surf to burst on
the shore dangerously it was a most deso-
late-looking shore myriads of sea birds
came out to greet the ship gannets man-
of-war birds with their shrill cries and
big bosns with now and then a molly-
hawk screamed and squawked about the
tops annoying mitka who swore at them
loudly to frighten them off under the
land a slight squall brushed past with a
hissing sound of rain and it darkened the
canvas in passing not a thing in the way
of a bay or harbor showed on the coast and
greene was disappointed the island was
not much over five miles long and he was
now well down to the leeward end of it

  the men had just taken their stations
when mitka hailed the deck boat right
ahead zur-right ahead zur he bawled
from aloft

  that brought all hands up standing
captain greene grabbed his glasses and
peered ahead spurling seized a backstay
of the mizzen and looked and the second
mate jumped to the sheer pole to get a
better view right over-the jib-boom end
lay a speck on the sea the sinking sun
shone  it and brought it out plainly as
it lay right in the path of light between
the ship and it

  dinghy right ahead zur-our dinghy
zur bawled mitka from aloft

  looks like there was some one in it
now who could have stolen that boat i
want to know  said the skipper

  how could any one steal it there
aint no one left this ship said spurling

  well theres three people in that boat
and its my dinghy all right-i can see the
number on the bow they didnt jump
out of the sea did they

  there might be mermaids about these
here islands said the second officer sol-
emnly if they are theyll jump over-
board directly and thatll be the last of
them

  the boat probably went ashore here
and them people just took it out for a
row around said the skipper in disgust
he turned to the helmsman keep her
right for the small boat-right ahead-
steady as you go

  steady sir came the answer

  get a line ready mr spurling well

   sea-

pick her right up in a few minutes or-
dered greene there seems to be a man
forard standing up with his hands over
his head hes praying-sure hes pray-
ing-or something looking right up into
the sky and waving his arms- 

  hes signaling us sir said spurling

  no hes looking away-hands up in
the air-hes praying i tell you went on
the skipper

  well it hasnt hurt him a mite-hell
git his prayers answered all right if he
hasnt stolen that boat

  the ship ran easily down before the
wind with her decks now cleared for the
evening watch there was silence aboard
as the men watched the boat ahead only
the swishing wash of the foam alongside
and a creaking of gear now and then from
aloft reached the ear greenes voice to
the helmsman steady as you go-spring
your luff a little-steady keep her off a
mite so-so steady as you go now was
the only word spoken the only voice
sounding loud enough to be heard

  you can furl the crojack mr spurl-
ing we wont want it any more to-night
he went on in a low tone

  the setting sun burned low a crimson
flame on the western horizon and in its
red glare the small boat ahead took on a
magnified shape the ship running at five
or six knots was coming down on it and
the occupants were now all waving their
arms frantically to attract attention the
wind eased but the ship continued her
headway from inertia the second mate
stood at the fore rigging with a small line
coiled for throwing

  stand by and catch this line he
roared as they came close

  the line of heads looking over the rail
saw the second officer throw the light coil
far ahead and a little to port the man
in the bow of the dinghy caught it took
a turn around the forward thwart and
as he did so he called to the young man
aft to swing the boats head so that she
would fall alongside the slowly running
ship she was drawn about swung head
on with the ship and as the ship kept her
way the boat drew alongside and struck
just forward of the main channels towing
safely and being held off from the ships
side

  lines were dropped and one with a
bowline was placed under the arms of the
young wife and she was whisked upward


sea stories

to the deck above where many hands
reached out to steady her and set her on
her feet then young walt went up and
lastly tawney sniah all three stood on
the deck of the georgia hope where they
were surrounded by the wild and half-
naked crew captain greene came to
them

  welcome aboard my ship-is there
anything i can do for you he stuttered
for he saw that they were all white people
in spite of their sunburn nothing was
asked about the possession of the dinghy
but the three were ushered below to a good
meal and whatever clothes the ship could
spare afterward sniah told his story

  i prayed for deliverance-and i got
it he ended when i saw your boat
coming in i knew that my prayers had
been heard

  the boats painter was rotten put in
walt with a grin it must have broken
adrift and come down on us at the rock
up to windward there you say this is
trinidad well then that was one of
the martin vas rocks that we ran on and
got stuck so long

  after the dinghy was hoisted in the ship
was hove to for the night and lay off about
five miles from the land under her topsails
with her fore-topsail to the mast the
castaways came on deck after a rest and
general clean up with a good dinner to top
off with the lady was tired but -she
averred that she rested better out in the
air as she had been used to doing for the
past few months and that she would
lounge about until sleepy the night was
fine and the tale of the three was listened
to by captain greene and his officers
with the steward also hearing it the sec-
ond mate of the ill-fated steamer rio stuck
to his belief that his prayers were responsi-
ble for everything and walt took amused
exception

  spurling listened also and said nothing
until it came to a case of a rotten line on
the dinghy

  i admit the line was rotten-theres lots
of this old gear thats no good and were
getting rid of it fast as we can but that
dont explain it all not all by a long
shot said he that boat was dead to
windward of that rock-must have been
when it broke loose in the squall why
was it do you know no you dont
know i dont know lots of things but
they somehow work out right you take

the secant of the latitude and add the co-
secant of the polar distance to one half the
sum of the angular distance the sun is
above the horizon at prime vertical to the
latitude and polar distance-and when you
add the cosine of the half sum and sine
of that minus the angular distance you get
what the sine of half the time-which
if you look it up in the tables you see is

the local time where youre at-

  what are you talking about asked
walt with amusement

  damn it if i know just what but
any fool can tell that if you get the time
and have a good chronometer and can
read it the difference in time reduced to
distance is your longitude east or west of
greenwich-see and there you are its
in the book there and thats the reason-
the only reason we know that this is trini-
dad island who told you it wasnt
no one of course admitted walt
you are probably right

  i am dead right-it all comes out that
way and by the same token i dont know
why or ho im right but i know im
right and will bet the life of the ship and
all hands on it-see

  you mean youve got to believe some
things that you cant quite explain said
wralt

  well now youve said it son-thats
what

chapter vi

he sun rose in the morning and the
ship took on new life the damp
dew of the tropic ocean was upon
the rails the salt dew with the smell of
the fresh salt sea a whiff of smoke
poured from the galley smoke pipe and the
smell of coffee drifted aft to the noses
of the castaways who had not smelled or
tasted that beverage for a long time

  the watch on deck with trousers rolled
high and naked from the waist up sluiced
the decks and squeegeed the planks while
the deck pump was worked with a will
and two men with a canvas bucket rigged
with a whip hoisted water from overside
the ship rolled slightly but was almost on
an even keel for the fore and main-top-
sails with the fore-topmast staysail was
not enough canvas in the light morning
breeze to more than give her just steering
way the man at the wheel holding the
spokes hard over left it at times and ex-
the lost boat survivor



pectorated overside and the wheel would
hardly roll back

  the georgia hove to with the main-
topsail aback just drifted sidewise over a
smooth sea with the rising sun shining
on her port side to windward the land
had fallen away somewhat during the
night but it was still in plain view the
high parts covered with a cloudlike mist
topped it like with an umbrella they
were close enough to see the green foliage
of the slopes and here and there a bare
spot like a landslide in the hills not a
break in that shore line not a bay or slue
to get even a small shelter it would be
right through the surf with a will to make
a landing the ship had now been at
sea for a long time and her water was
gone her fuel for cooking-wood-was
also used up and she would have to take
in enough to last at least two months or
more for the run north to the states

  hakluyt in some of his voyages re-
marks about trinidad and so also does
doctor hailey in  amaro delano
shortly afterward visited the place and less
than a quarter of a century later commo-
dore owens visited it but in the s mr
knight visited the spot with the avowed
intention of digging up buried treasure
and he spent a good deal of money and
time there in his own yacht trying to find
it he claimed that a landslide swept over
the place he had indicated and so gave
the matter up leaving but beliewing that
the treasure was still there

  in  a great store of plate and gold
was said to have been buried there being
treasure that had been captured by pirates
who plundered it from the peruvians it
was buried there when the spaniards lied
that country and tried to carry it away
the pirates who frequented the southern
ocean at that date came upon them and
took it and buried it somewhere on what
was called sugar loaf hill

  walt had read of this and was the only
one aboard who knew the details captain
greene had often heard the legend but
paid little attention to it spurling who
had read nothing much all his life knew
nothing about the story it was just be-
fore this time when the georgia hope ar-
rived off the island that the british seized
it for a cable station as it lay almost
directly on the route for their cable to
brazil the cable company had not
wasted time digging for pirate gold it

hauled the deep ocean cable ashore in what
they called southwest bay a slight inden-
tation of the leeward side of the island
and built a small cable hut for their relay
walt had read the cruise of the acrte
by e c knight and he was mightily in-
terested when he found that he had by
this unexpected turn of fortune been
taken to trinidad

  he had not known until spurling had
told him that this was indeed trinidad
of the south seas the treasure island of
fable and romance-and perhaps reality

  after breakfast the two boats spurl-
ings and watsons took four men each
and made ready to go ashore the ship
was braced up and headed slowly in until
she lay within a mile of the shore then
with her main yard backed she lay hove
to while the boats were dropped they
got away handily and rowed briskly for
the beach

  the three castaways were too much ex-
hausted to take a great interest in this
first exploration and they rested aboard
the young wife sleeping in a spare state-
room for hours to make up for the hard-
ship she had gone through greene sat
about aft under an improvised awning over
the stern and smoked and read his bow-
ditch the men on deck worked at reev-
ing new gear and sending down some of
the worn-out lighter sails from aloft to re-
place them with new ones for the run
home

  spurling came in close and found the
surf very heavy in spite of the wind being
so light it burst over the outer reef in
dull thunder and piled high and dan-
gerous shooting jets of foam into the air
the second mate held off and waited for
orders or to see what the mate would do
first whalemen are the best small boat-
men in the world they actually live in
the light craft which they use for hunting
-and for handling them in deep water
they cannot be surpassed but surf is an-
other thing entirely one must know surf
to make it safe in heavy weather

  a dull thunder filled the air and seemed
to reverberate up the heights through the
woods and into the mist cap above

  steady the port oars said spurling
in an even voice which carried through the
sullen boom of the sea mitka his har-
pooner who was pulling no  oar turned
his head apprehensively and howarth the
powerful stroke eased and let his oar lie


sea stories

flat on the sea the mate gazed steadily
seaward there was no sign of a smooth
 slatch nor any let-up in the serried col-
umns of rollers which swept in with majes-
tic grandeur from the open ocean

  well have have to run her-stand by
when i give the order and send her
through with a will said spurling

  the second officer lay off and waited
to see what would happen before trying
it his boat remained motionless save
for the gentle rising and falling on the
swell spurling headed straight in and
went slowly looking over his shoulder and
holding the steering oar firmly in both
hands the whaleboat topped a high swell
and started down its slope shoreward it
gained momentum and held true

  give her hell roared spurling
drive her in now while shes going right
break those oars-bust em-

  the four men lay back with a will the
mate seemed to tower above them as he
stood in the stern lifting in the air the
whaleboat shot forward with the speed of
an express train there was a snarling
hiss aft a great sea raised its head high
higher and the light of the sun shone
through the clear water making it appear
greenish-blue-scintillating then with
a hissing roar it broke

  but spurling held her true in a wild
smother of foam the boat shot ahead and
then dropped down the back of the roller
and lay within the outer reef right
ahead on the shore and about halfway up
the hillside they could see a stone hut
showing through the green shrubbery a
man stood in the doorway he was
dressed in dirty white cotton clothes and
wore a cap of blue cloth he came down
to the beach and waved a hand at them
motioning them to come farther along to-
ward the point to the westward he was
joined by another dressed like himself
and the two walked slowly along the beach
to a point which they indicated wras the
place to land they were the two cable
men stationed at the hut and they showed
no signs of excitement spurling followed
their directions and came in on the shore
where they waded out and helped beach the
boat hauling her high and dry up the
sand the men had jumped out before
she struck and all with the exception of
the mate were wet to their armpits the
second mates boat followed in and the
wood crew were safe ashore water casks

were thrown out and rolled up the beach
and axes were seized for wood cutting

  i thought you would roll her over
blimme said the first of the cable men
whalers hey wood an water-what
i say me lad im right glad to meet you
-name please 

  georgia hope-new bedford yeah
we want plenty of wood and some good
water said spurling holding forth his
hand which was grasped heartily

  blimme me lad but youve come to
the right spot-theres lots of both an
damn little else except turtles an them
bloomin land crabs come along an well
show you i say but vere yanks i take
it said the cable man

  the crowd went up the trail leading to
the high land above and the mate lost 
time getting the men to chopping wood
a stream of clear water ran down the slope
of the shalelike rocks and while it was
not large it was sufficient to fill the casks
handily two men were set to work fill-
ing them while spurling and the second
mate went with the englishmen to the
cable hut

  a bit of a lonesome life hey asked
the mate

  i say it is that but the cable ship was
here five months back an shes due here
now within a month or two more me an
my matey get along all right enough but
the whack is gettin sort of low jest a
few airtights left-like turtle meat  he
went on as they entered the hut

  the little house was not more than ten
by fifteen feet and built of stone with a
wooden roof the bare floor was clean
and hard-packed dirt a couple of bunks
and two rough chairs furnished the place
a small wood stove in a corner and a few
shelves for utensils made the cooking out-
fit as trinidad is nearly twenty-one
south latitude or well down toward the
tropic of capricorn it is midsummer there
in january and as it was the fifth of this
month the sun was now almost directly
overhead it was warm only during the
smoother summer months could small
boats land in that surf it was a most
isolated and deserted spot a few hogs
half a dozen sheep and a few goats left
by the cable company were the only ani-
mals  the island the cable men lived
mostly on chickens having an immense
flock wandering about the place the
place was fairly crowded with birds of
the lost boat survivor



all kinds and one could eat chicken or
birds eggs daily

  spurling got his load off early but left
two men ashore to cut wood for the next
load he made five trips that day and
was only upset once in the surf

nhe next day walt warthier had
rested enough to beg permission to
go inshore with the water boat he
remembered knights book and he was
now anxious to explore the strange island
and see what he might find his wife was
also recovered enough to want exercise
and she also asked captain greene to al-
low them to go with spurling in the whale-
boat sniah turned to with the crew of
the georgia and worked on deck he had
been thoroughly satiated with islands and
needed no more of them for some time

  the mate did not object to passengers
in fact the girl interested him in a cer-
tain way but he was respectful always
and held her in proper regard alice was
dressed in a suit of mens apparel-there
being no womens things aboard the ship
-and she was a strong and hardy-looking
person in jumper and trousers rolled to the
knee she was really a beautiful girl but
now sunburned to a deep mahogany brown
from her long honeymoon on the rock of
the martin vas the steady diet of turtle
beef and eggs had not hurt her physically
at all walt warthier did not speak to
greene of what was really in his mind the
idea of that treasure but greene suspected
strongly his object and smiled an inscru-
table smile

  young people he thought had many
strange fancies especially those who
spent honeymoons on deserted rocks in
mid-ocean the skipper had read the
cruise of the alerte and had set down
mr knights story as a flight of fancy
not popularized like the book of steven-
son

  walt and his wife went along with
spurling and the little gold earrings in the
mates ears scintillated in the sunshine as
he shook his head at their fancies spur-
ling was rough but he was not too rough
and his past as a bucko mate in western
ocean packets had been forgotten by most
heavy-bearded and square-faced brown
and hard he was rather piratical looking
but he was polite withal

  the boats crew looked like pirates all
were half naked and wore just cotton

trousers rolled to bare knees their tat-
tooed chests were burned to a deep brown
from a years service in the tropics on the
deck of a whale ship all carried sheath
knives long knives in leather sheaths
strapped to their sides by their belts no
sailor went about his work without a knife
he might need it any minute on a line
one or two allowed their hair to grow
long all around but most of them chopped
it raggedly about the neck where it joined
their beards walt and his wife had been
in steamers but no steamer ever carried
crews like this the boat swamped going
in but it caused little inconvenience as it
kept afloat until it passed over the outer
reef and came into shallow water

  walt found himself ashore on trinidad
and with his wife wandered into the up-
lands to look the place over the hut
where the cable men lived did not interest
him nor did the cable hut where the wire
came in do so either he set out for
sugar loaf hill at once and tried to
remember just exactly the location set
down by mr e c knight in his book
on the alertes cruise alice followed him
and enjoyed the climb in spite of the thick
tropical growths

  together they made their way inland
and steered for the highest part of the hill
which could be seen at times from clear-
ings there were no trails except those
made by the goats and hogs wild pigeons
or doves flocked about them in the woods
and along the edges of the cliffs thousands
of sea fowl screamed and hovered

  they came finally to a few stone huts
these showed at once a great age doctor
hailey speaks of them and they were
probably built by the portuguese pirates a
couple of hundred years back the walls
of two or three were still in good repair
after these centuries but the roofs had
disappeared as had also the doors and
other woodwork the plateaus were over-
grown but from the edge of the shelf
walt could guess about where a trail for-
merly led upward to the higher hill be-
yond at the base of the rise they found
a stone hut of large size it was very old
the walls just showing through the green
foliage walt examined it broke through
the jungle of shrubbery and followed by
his wife gained the inclosure of the four
standing walls  le kicked about in the
dirt floor which had not so much grass
on it and in a coiner found the barrel of


sea stories

an old gun it was red with rust hut it
could be distinguished easily the stock
had gone but the flintlock was still intact
and with the flint in it the affair had a
muzzle like a bell flared out several inches
in diameter it was very old

  now alice youve always said i didnt
care enough for you to live alone with
you on an island far away from every one
-how about it do you want to stick
around here for a few months with just
me he asked his wife

  well she said we dont want to go
to the united states we want to go home
to our own argentine the whaler is
going on a long voyage north and well
probably never be able to pay our way
home after we get to new bedford be-
sides weve been gone half a year and
every one thinks were dead yes id just
as soon stick it out here for a few months
until the cable ship comes in and takes us
to buenos aires thats only a weeks
run then were home again and all right
walt put his arm around her and drew
her close to him you are a bit all right
girl he said any girl who would agree
to live on a desert island with her man
must care for him a lot-and i sure do
care for you

  she put her arms around his neck and
kissed him he held her a moment and
then let her go no he said finally it
wouldnt do not at all-not at all i just
wanted to try you out alice-youre all
right

  she smiled at him and they wandered
on hand in hand

  right up there where that slide is
right on the edge of the hill there thats
the place knight says the treasure was
buried theres a thousand tons of rock

and earth over it-

  treasure-what treasure she asked
well there was treasure buried here or
placed here years ago-probably more than
a century pirates took it from the span-
iards who in turn took it from the peruvi-
ans-from their churches their homes in
the days of the incas pirates often wa-
tered here got wood same as captain
greene is doing now and this place was
never visited at all-it was a safe place
for anything

  were you thinking of digging for it
asked his wife slyly is that the real
reason you want to stick around here
we are not going to stick around here

treasure or no treasure-ive found the
greatest treasure a man ever finds in this
world-a good loving woman wholl stick
with him-even on an island and he gave
he another hug after all money isnt
everything well get along somehow
after we get back home

  yes we started off our honeymoon on
a sea voyage-we might as well finish it
on one we can get back all right but
im willing to stay right here and help find
that gold-if you want to said his wife

  pirate gold pirate gold-it does sound
interesting doesnt it now but were not
going to dig for it however that wont
stop us from looking the place over a bit
maybe we can find something and well
be here two or three days yet cutting
wood

  walt carried the barrel of the old blun-
derbuss along with him and they wan-
dered all day through the uplands coming-
out on the edge of the cliffs to the north-
ward the cliffs were solid guano from
centuries of bird inhabitants there was
enough guano deposited in the countless
thousands of years to fertilize the entire
british islands the air was filled with
flying bodies the ground was covered with
birds of all kinds these did not appear
to mind the approach of the two humans
and sat perfectly still while the pair poked
them with their feet to make them rise
late in the evening walt and his wife
went back aboard the ship and captain
greene grinned as he asked for details

  going to do any digging he asked
well be here several days yet

  well said walt we dont want to
go back to the states with you for we
live down in the argentine and its a long
way home for us but we dont expect you
to carry us all the way back either

  i certainly cant do that interrupted
greene id lose too much time and itd
cost you too much

  we could wait here for the cable ship
-if she is really due soon-but i reckon
youll have to give us a berth to new
bedford said walt

  and no staying on and digging
grinned the skipper

  id like to spend the next three days
while youre here at it said walt but
no longer than that-can you lend me a
pick and shovel

  i sure can do that easily said greene
and i hope you find millions

  going to dig grinned the skipper
well why not-you can lend me a pick
and shovel cant you said sniah

  hope you all make a million laughed
the skipper  but your two passengers are
going north with me

  ill stick alone until the cable ship
comes in about two or three weeks that
britisher says then ill get to b a in
another week and try and get a ship it
was great to have met you skipper and

i surely owe you my life-

  forget it mate said greene i was
looking for my dinghy not you but im
glad we picked you up just the same ill
stake you to a bag of flour and some coffee
and matches cant give you much you
know-were short now but youre used
to turtle steak by this time and theres a
lot of chickens and eggs ashore there
maybe youll find something after all
he stood up from his deck chair and shook
the officers hand

  sniah put his meager belongings into a
small cask sealed it up to keep his matches
dry went in with the second officer and
was duly rolled over in the surf he man-
aged to get ashore safely and save his cask
all dry inside and with it he set up house-
keeping with the two cable men to await
the coming of the relief ship the two
men were glad to have him for company
walt and his wife took tools ashore and
prospected for the lost plate supposed to
have been buried under the landslide as
told by the former hunters

  like eating soup with a toothpick this
digging into a mountain said he to his
wife who helped him and made jocular
comments during his work if i only had
a map some sort of guide-nine fathoms
from a skull-two northeast and twenty
strides farther than you can throw a pickax
by the handle then dig

  ridiculous agreed his wife why
dont you quit and cool off

  he dropped the tool and kicked the dirt
at his feet something broke out of the
ground he stooped to pick it up

  it was a small object and he rubbed
it on his trousers to clean it then he saw
it was an ivory cross-a cross about ten
inches long by six wide and in each ivory
end was set a large stone with a larger
stone set in the center it was somewhat
yellow with age and dirt but it had evi-
dently been a piece of value in some an-
cient cathedral or church walt kicked
the dirt about some more and unearthed a
silver standard into which the cross had
been fixed

  well heres something anyhow-
shows that the tale is not all foolish about
buried treasure said he

  dig some more said alice with a
smile

 he dug he dug all day nothing
more showed

  for three more days he dug into that
hillside but not a thing of value showed
the third day greene announced that he
had his wood and water aboard and would
sail at once there was nothing now to do
but either stay or give the matter up
sniah took the pick and shovel from him
with the announced intention of digging
when the humor took him walt and his
wife remained aboard the georgia hope
and the boats were hoisted in

  down on the shore three figures showed
-the two cable men and sniah and that
second mate of the rio was standing with
his hands thrown high above his head with
his face lifted to the sky

  look walt the mate is praying for
us said alice pointing to the figure
bull spurling watched him with set face
his little earrings shining in the sunlight
walt waved his hand but sniah still held
his position

 damn good man-wish we had him
aboard here said spurling in a low tone
well need all the prayers we can get
before we run this hooker home

  stations bawled greene from the
quarter-deck now then mr spurling
get your men along-lee main brace there
swing those yards handily smartly now
smartly-loose the main-tgantsl fore-
tgantsl main royal and fore royal-
mizzen topsail main-topmast staysail

  the men swung the heavy yards the
main-topsail filled again pulling fair

  dray away the fore-staysail jib fore-
topmast staysail

  the ship swung off the wind and gath-
ered way the gurgling of the side wash

grew louder as she went along men
raced aloft to loosen sail those on deck
stood at the halyards and let go clewlines
and buntlines the second mate stood at
the little bow gun and pulled the lanyard

  boom a loud report and a cloud of
white powder smoke flung away to leeward
in the breeze the georgia hope was off
off for the northern hemisphere and would
see trinidad no more the last they saw
of tawney sniah was the figure of that
husky second mate of the rio standing
on the shore with hands aloft and face
upraised in prayer

  the georgia stood away with the trade
wind on her starboard quarter and she did
a full nine knots loaded deep with her
cargo she crossed the line ten days later
ducked about in the doldrums for a few
days and then picked up the northeast
trade and stood up the north atlantic for
home the weather grew cooler men
put on clothes the half-naked look of
wild savages disappeared and jumpers
were worn then oilskins

  by the time the ship was up to the ber-
mudas and laying a course for nantucket
shoals lightship the weather grew rough
it was winter in the northern hemisphere
the month of march with its storms and
rains and it was bad weather for coming
on the coast greene had so far had good
luck his ship was heavy with oil but
he had made a good passage and was near-
ing home the decks were spotless the
smell of rancid oil had long disappeared
new canvas had been bent new lines rove
off and spurling had been busy painting
until the old georgia looked almost like a
yacht heavy and slow she logged along
until abreast of hatteras

     when the bermudas let you pass

     then beware of hatteras

  so hummed spurling as he watched the
vessel driving along at nine knots through
a white smother of foam her topsails wet
from water and stiff as boards and her
main-topgallant sail the highest sail on her

  the glass was low in fact it was very
low and falling greene watched it with
conccrn the wind was southeast and
blowing fresh the little scud flying fast and
low across a dull steel-colored sky

  walt and his wife stayed mostly on
deck the motion below was rather hard
to bear without something to do beams
creaked and groaned bulkheads crashed

and quivered and the noise wore out the
nerves

  i wonder how poor old sniah is by
this time said the girl do you think
he would ever find anything in that awful
hill 

  anyhow he has good weather down
there said her husband and he dont
have to pray for it either this is going
to be bad before it gets better

  well that fine weather that tropic
heat gets tiresome for always i for one
dont mind a bit of change-even a good
old storm anything to break the monotony
of the same old thing over and over all
the time

  girl youll want plenty of monotony
before we get in if this breaks like i think
it will said walt

  it was then late in the morning by
eight bells it was blowing harder and com-
ing in squalls the weather thickening up
and the glass going down a tremendous
sea was now running strong and fast from
the eastward it broke over the georgia
and smothered her decks swamped them
clear to the topgallant rails lines gear
everything not lashed down was being
washed about

  spurling had the boats lashed in with
extra gripes they hung high from the
wooden davits and strongbacks and they
were much in the way a sea coming
along at two bells rose high above the
starboard quarter and lifted its head into
the air

  it was menacing dangerous and the
light of day shone through its crest mak-
ing it appear a dull green the top broke
with a hissing roar and swept over the
georgia in a niagara of water and foam
the ship caught unfairly broached to and
lay down on her side burying her port
rail deep below the surface captain
greene hanging to the quarter rail yelled
frantically to the helmsman to hold her
spurling at the mizzen roared orders to
settle down the topgallant sail men half
swimming half wading up to their necks
in foam endeavored to obey orders some
one let go the halyard and the topgallant
sail started it slatted the parrel jammed
a little and slowed it then it was all aback
and instantly it burst and blew to pieces
stripping from the yard and streaming
away in irish pennants to leeward a dark
squall swept low over the ship and the
noise of the wind droned into a deep boom-
the lost boat survivor



ing roar as it tore past shroud and back-
stay downhaul and clcwline and went to
leeward

  the port side of the main deck was
several feet under the sea the georgia
lay dead and lost her headway hardly
moving in the turmoil

  get below-get below-both of you
bawled greene to his two castaways

  but walt and his wife refused to go
they decided that it was better to be on
deck in such a fracas at least they could
see what was taking place below the
motion and racket of straining timbers was
too nerve trying men worked on the
mizzen topsail and finally got it down then
the main and all the time the ship lay
in the trough of the sea and seemed like
she would never rise again pinally with
the fore-topsail and staysail on her for-
ward and nothing aft save the main-top-
mast staysail she began to pay off and
gather way she dragged her side through
the boiling foam and suddenly she righted
and rolled viciously to windward sending
a cataract of water across her decks men
were washed about shouting and clinging
to whatever they could lay hand to

  with another man at the wheel spokes
she was held firmly and in a little while
she was going again before the gale with
the wind now almost aft and the sea fol-
lowing her all the boats on the port side
had vanished greene regardless of the
laws of storms ran his ship northwest be-
fore a gale which promised to develop into
almost a hurricane he was heading for
home and he would go fast indeed the
foresail held the topsail over it was eased
a bit and with just the two fore-and-aft
sails to help hold her-the two staysails-
she drove along through a smother of
white and rolling and pitching ran head-
long to the northward as if inspired with
a wild yearning for the home port

  the taking in of that main-topsail was
a piece of work to be remembered the
men came down on deck afterward all
tired out and exhausted now with the
foresail slacked off and the topsail above
it eased at the sheet there would be no
more going aloft for those sails would
have to stay until they burst the fore
and main-topmast staysails would never be
furled for if they once started they would
go to pieces

  the georgia trembled from truck to
keel she shook and groaned rolled and

wallowed but she drove onward at twelve
knots and the men were more cheerful
the wheel was relieved and with tackles
to help hold it the ship tore along all day
and all night and the next day was far to
the northward

few days later -she came into new
bedford with her rigging slack her
painted sides sea-washed and her
gear looking like she had been through a
stiff fight but she was safe at last and
she docked to discharge her valuable cargo
greene had finished his years work and
was richer by several thousand dollars
the men had a good wide cut with bonuses
and walt and his wife went to the consuls
to try and get some means of going home
to their argentine

  they were sent down to new york
where a ship was almost ready to sail for
buenos aires and there walt took the
ivory cross to a specialist in jewelry

  the middle diamond is probably worth
a thousand dollars said he and the three
emeralds set in the ends probably that
much more may i ask where you came
to get hold of this piece

  you may but i would hardly be likely
to tell you said walt the man handed
it back with a smile

  it took a week of careful study and ma-
neuvering to sell the thing for no one
cared to buy anything so evidently out of
place as an ivory cross in a mans pocket
finally he sold it for three thousand dol-
lars then he went to the consuls and
got a proper passport and ticket for home
his story was now well known to all the
loss of the steamer rio grande had not
been forgotten

  that second mate of the rio-you left
him ashore at trinidad  asked the consul

  yes he refused to come all the way
north with the georgia-what about him
asked walt

  well it might interest you to know
that he was your friend he was taken
off the island by the cable ship a few
weeks later after you left and he carried
several barrels of stuff with him he and
the two cable men shared the stuff what-
ever it was and he deposited a draft for
five thousand dollars to your credit at
buenos aires then he shipped in a
steamer and went east about around the
cape

  five thousand dollars yelled walt


sea stories

left it to us-my wife and i what
for

  there is nothing said what for we
two consuls both at new bedford and
here just received the news it was sent
because he knew you would soon be up
this way and would probably need the
money-but just how he got hold of all
that money is a question said the consul

  well ill be eternally sunk-what do
i think of that poor old sniah said
walt as he hastened away to tell his wife

  it would be just like him said alice
after receiving the news after all he
was a good man for all his roughness-
and he always liked me

  ill say he must have liked you
aplenty said walt but he grinned as
he took his wife in his arms they were
well pleased and talked the matter over

holding hands there in the dusk and wait-
ing to go aboard the steamer to take them
home

  walt could envisage the sturdy mate
the rough but steady second officer of the
ill-fated rio he could see him again as
he used to stand on the top of martin vas
holding his hands aloft and praying with
his face to the sky

  save me from this desert rock before i
go mad and the deep thunderous
roar of the southern ocean would sound
again upon the ears like the wild chant
of a giant litany he could see again the
faithful and retiring man working and
trying to keep all hands alive on that
frightful rock in mid-ocean

  yes he said finally that mate was
a good man-i would like to see him once
more

ye muttered topsl tom in a
 complacent far-away tone as he
 wiped his mouth with the back of
 his hand aye thats the life i
 dream of it often

   he drew a long breath tipped his mug
 drained it and after a dramatic pause
 repeated thats the life no work and
  no worry warm it is no summer nor
 no winter-like spring all the long year
 wi vittles aplenty wi the boom o the
 surf far off like distant thunder wi
 fislj and wi-wi- he winked know-
 ingly to his listener across the table who
 winked roguishly in reply

    to the life he announced

 then he gazed in mild surprise at the
 bottom of his mug as though it were a

mystery to him how it had become empty
his companion was quick to thump on
the table and bawl out an order in a voice
that echoed and boomed through the long
low-ceilinged taproom of the harpooners
haven

  when the mugs had again been filled
topsl tom took up his interrupted dis-
course

  aye coconuts breadfruit and bananas

stew he smacked his lips fish yeve

tom warmed up to his subject a bit

of an arti-st was lie he half closed his
eyes and in a low deliberate voice con-
tinued well get free from cuttin in
and irvin out from slidin around on
blubbery decks from takin orders from
obeyin them far beyond the sound of
thar she blows far off from the call
of lower away a peaceful life i says
a peaceful passage of the days a quiet
passin o the nights wi never all hands
on deck to break up a mans rest well
go thar aye that we will

  his partner nodded open-mouthed his
eyes big and round with interest

  aye that we will he repeated ye
tickle me fancy tom as sure as me name
is denny murray im wi ye then a
thin doubt entered his voice but these
squcege islands ye mention how will we
make our way to them a long beat to
windward they be how-

  his words were interrupted as the door
of the harpooners haven flew open the
two seated at the table saw a squat broad-
shouldered man powerfully built his hands
like two hams his face marked with the
scars of many a fight standing in the door-
way behind him in the feeble light from
the lantern hanging outside the entrance
they caught a glimpse of the white snow-
covered street the big fleecy snowflakes
floating slowly down past the blob of light
as feathers fall

   tortygee joe denny whispered
call him over well get more news from
these squeege islands from him

  portygee toe noticed them ah he
called i glad to see you we sail in
morning he held up a couple of fingers
we two men short capll say joe you
find two boat steerers find two good mens
what can reef steer now i find come
he invited help work ship

  but the two were in no hurry they
wanted to know first the f inback  a
doubtful hesitant expression swept across
their faces captain forse a scrimy man
that the finback a hard ship boot toe
and belaying pin followed often preceded
an order on the finback

  they pulled out their pipes and leisurely
shaved tobacco off the plugs as they lis-
tened quite unimpressed by the mates en-
couraging picture which he painted of the
advantages to be gained the money to be
made

  we go on line cruise capn find lots
whale last time on line

  topsl toms disinterested expression
changed

  to the squeege islands he questioned
quickly

  portygee joe nodded a disgusted look
on his face island no good he said
we go brava ah we all have fine grand
drunk there we go round horn capn
forse mebbe gone shore leave payta we
all raise hell eh

  the mates black eyes sparkled in antici-
pation a nod passed between the two
white men

  a line cruise tom whispered

  to the squeege islands denny added

  then both spoke were your men
one more drink and off we go

  they held up their mugs luck they
called luck to the venture

  the mate wore a puzzled frown on his
face as he drank to their ready acceptance
he had foreseen a hard task ahead of him
it usually was a difficult matter to recruit
a crew for the finback captain b orse
had a reputation for hard work and short
victuals seldom he brought the same crew
back home that he had taken out the
portuguese had been first mate on the
finback for several voyages only because
he owned a thirty-second share in her he
wondered why these two who knew the
reputation of the vessel were so easily in-
duced to ship

  down the street white with its blanket
of snow the three scrunched along arm in
arm they stopped at a boarding house
tom and denny packed their sea bags
a quarter of an hour later they- pulled out
to the old bark finback lying in the
stream the soft snowfall had turned to
a cutting sleet the wind blew cold and
raw out of the northeast the whaleboat
clinked and bumped against the floating
ice in the harbor and finally came along-
side the bark captain forse himself met
them as they came over the rail he could
scarcely conceal his astonishment not so
much as that they were reasonably sober
but that they should ship at all drunk or
sober with him

 for topsl tom and denny murray
were two as good men as could be found
in new bedford they could pick their
ship

  he watched them walk aft their bags
on their shoulders and muttered theres
something up something up ill keep my
eye on the pair
smell of salt horse



arly next morning the finback was
towed down the harbor and cast off
the hawser from the tug beyond
cuttvhunk under courses and lower top-
sails she laid her course for the cape
verdes it was a miserable cold day
alternating sleet and snow and a cutting
wind that drove through thin clothes-
a day of numbed fingers and chattering
teeth their faces pinched their lips blue
the green crew swept the deck a dozen
times the afterguard stamped nerveless
feet or swung their arms to keep up the
circulation cursed the leaden sky the bit-
ing wind double cursed the crew who
seasick chilled through stumbled around
driven to their work by club and fist

  every one on board was depressed and
nasty tempered all save tom and denny
warmed by an inner fire of contemplation
in their minds eyes they saw not slush
and snow but clear sunshine on a coral
beach gazing into the future they looked
on ease and comfort the chill northeaster
swept by them turned off by the armor
of their hopes

  portygee joe the mate swore long and
earnestly at half a dozen of the crew who
were shoving the slush off the deck with
short boards fastened to the ends of har-
poon shafts then calling tom he turned
the task over to him and went below to
where the stove in the cabin red-hot and
glowing invited his company

  crouched in the lee of the try-works
aft of the foremast tom in a low voice
muttered to denny who huddled beside
him

  sleet and snow bitter cold ice and
frost-aye denny theres none o that in
the squeeges

  denny wiped his dripping nose and said
aye tom weve not long to put up wi
such discomforts

  a boy came teetering across the slip-
pery decks a bucket in one hand a coffee-
pot in the other making his way from the
galley to the forecastle with dinner toms
face wrinkled in a wry grimace

  salt horse and lobscouse he muttered
as though the very thought of those filled
him with a deep disgust

  the finback shouldered her path across
the trackless highway of the seas over
the obliterated trail of many a new bed-
ford whaler that had gone before for
the trip to the cape verde islands was a
regular one crews were hard to procure

in the states the west was opening up
there were rich fertile acres to be had
for the mere taking beyond the mississippi
there was gold in california-nuggets so
the wild reports proclaimed as big as hens
eggs lying free and unhidden along the
rivers edges a migration had started
the adventurous the romantic the youth of
the east were leaving their homes by
thousands putting out  the long traverse
toward the setting sun

  the hard workof whaling offered few
inducements and fewer hopes of gain
most whaling ships left short-handed
sailed to the cape verdes and recruited
foremast hands from among the brava
portuguese so captain forse with half
a crew forward and scarce a half comple-
ment of officers aft was on his way to fill
his lists before starting on his venture

hree weeks later he anchored at
brava the first night ten men of
the crew jumped the ship in spite
of a double watch on deck to prevent it
it was an easy matter to slip overside and
swim to one of the bumboats hovering
around the finback in the darkness

  as was to be expected some of the fore-
mast hands were but work-aways and had
taken this opportunity to make their pas-
sage home thus saving the fare on a packet
the following morning captain forse was
in an ugly humor when the desertions
were reported to him he cursed the officers
on watch cursed the hands that had taken
french leave and wound up his tirade
by a fervent lurid promise that till the fin-
back came to a mooring in new bedford
harbor the only way another man would get
clear of the ship would be to die off of it

  tom and denny were none too well
pleased at the turn affairs had taken they
foresaw a difficult time ahead even the
possibility that no chance for escape would
open up loomed large yet neither by
word nor act did either betray their desires
or their plans good workers they an-
ticipated orders never shirked duty never
grumbled

  the finback drove leisurely angling
across the south atlantic the boats were
all in readiness the mastheads manned
yet as the old bark wallowed along in
the sweep of the equatorial current settling
westward nothing happened to break the
monotony the northeast trades were left
behind for two weeks she was in the



i


sea stories

grip of the baffling horse latitudes then
the southeast trade winds bulged her sooty
canvas and carrying a bow wave up on
her blunt nose the finback shoved down
toward the horn

  there was some talk of putting in at
rio-talk that came to nothing for the
finback was five hundred miles offshore
when she passed the mouth of the rio de
la plata reaching down for the wind-
scourged antarctic down around the tip
of the continent of the americas where
the boisterous gales sweep screaming
across the gray waters the finback worked
her way tack and tack against the prevail-
ing westerlies a long leg down to the
southward a long leg back and captain
forse squinting through the eyepiece of
his wooden hog yoke each time the sun
was visible cursed long and earnestly at
the slow progress

week ten days passed one
morning topsl tom was standing
his trick at the wheel close-hauled
the old bark shoved against the long-run-
ning seas suddenly from up ahead a wall
of water rose the finback sluggishly
rose to meet it the sea broke with a
roar there came a glimpse of the lar-
board boats splintering into matchwood-
a hissing racing steep-fronted wave swept
clear over the deck obliterating all signs
of ship save the three masts and the men
who had jumped clear clinging to the
shrouds

  as the sea ran off tom heard the
dreaded cry man overboard

  he shook the water off caught his
breath and looked there just alongside
a head bobbed-a face terror-stricken
turned on him

  it was denny crying help tom
help

  no time to lose tom left the wheel
grabbed the end of the spanker sheet rove
a bowline in it and looped it through the
air it circled the bobbing head he cast
off the turns around a cleat the spanker
flew out with a rush the sheet came
whining in and denny with it jerked
clear up even with the rail just as tom
grabbed him there came the screech of
splintered timbers and the rip of torn can-
vas the ship was caught aback the
jib boom twisted snapped down came
the fore-topmast the main-topgallant mast
followed with a loud crunching roar-a

roar that was echoed by the captains voice
a moment later

  all hands were set to work to clear the
litter of wreckage that trailed alongside
that done toms turn came there were
no preliminaries and no resistance he
was triced up to the mizzen shrouds and
a knotted rope wielded by portygec joe
whistled through the air and cut his bared
back cruelly time after time he went
slack and limply hung by his wrists his
toes dragging back and forth across the
deck as the ship rolled denny tears
streaming down his cheeks could only
stand by and bite his lips till they bled

  if the finback had been a hard ship
before it became a hell ship now the
wind had shifted to the southward and the
vessel under short rig cleared the horn
in the next two days down in the fore-
castle the crew spoke hopefully and in
whispers of their chances to jump ship if
they put into port to rerig they need
have no hopes as they soon found out
carpenter and sailmaker blacksmith and
mates went to work and the crew had no
watch below daytime while the finback
drove before a brisk southerly breeze re-
pairs were made two weeks later there
was small evidence left of the damage she
had sustained yet on topsl toms back
were the half-healed scars and in his soul
were scars that would be longer in healing

jpgjhristmas day came there was
jlll little to tell of its coming save that
day the cook made up plum duff a
sticky mass of flour seasoned with ginger
and cinnamon the plums were but
pieces of dried apple the whole mass boiled
in a bag it was greeted with loud shouts
of approval when it made its appearance
in the forecastle even this small cheer
was begrudged for when captain forse
discovered the cook had been into his priv-
ate store of dried apples he rated him
soundly

  fruit good fruit for my table and
feeding it to those swine forward no
more of this or- he nodded signifi-
cantly toward the mizzen shrouds

  and there was no more hard-tack
and salt horse lobscouse small pieces of
beef pounded biscuit and a few potatoes
boiled up together and liberally seasoned
with pepper became the regular fare even
the scouse as the days passed became
more and more destitute of potatoes
smell of salt horse



  up the latitudes the finback borne on
the bosom of the pacific and pushed by the
steady southeast trades worked her way
one monotonous day died another was
born with little to separate them save the
setting sun sinking in a blaze of glory each
evening the night whisking down star-
spangled and the rising orb popping up
over the far lip of the sea in the morning
the blue indigo of the ocean the clean
sweep of the wind the fleecy trade clouds
scudding above all seemed to denny and
tom to mock them sitting on deck work-
ing up oakum weaving thrumming or do-
ing the other useless jobs that portygee
joe invented to keep them employed

  the watch on deck bad as it was could
not compare with the watch below the
forecastle dark even on the brightest day
was foul with the stench of bilge water
moldy with the hot damp of the tropics
a heavy fetid aura of unwashed men and
souring bedding welled up from the open
forecastle hatch yet in its narrow con-
fines twoscore foremast hands ate and
slept-a motley crew black and tan white
and brown men drawn from all the world
ignorant credulous taking no pleasure in
the present having small hopes for the fu-
ture

  aft in the officers quarters while liv-
ing conditions were better still the same
gloomy depressing atmosphere prevailed
save in tom and dennys little eubby-hole
off the main cabin which they as boat
steerers occupied a secret was there to
brighten it up-a secret and a hidden hoard
that as opportunity offered was added to
piece by piece and bit by bit as the days
passed

he voyage six months old now had
been unproductive they were on
the line sperm whale should have
been sighted weeks ago back and forth
in an aimless casual zigzag the finback
weaved a few miles north a league south
of the equator and as day followed day
save for porpoise breeching or a fish leap-
ing clear of the water never a sign of
life met the searching eyes of the look-
outs perched high up  the mastheads

  a morning broke clear and the trades
blew steadily rustling across the canvas
the ocean blue spattered with little white-
caps stretched out out till it met the in-
finity of the sky line the place of meet-
ing seemed as clear cut as though it were

a painted circle with the finback in its ex-
act center

  tom and denny were aloft in the fore
rings leaning lazily over the padded hoops
dreaming swaying in a little arc as the ship
methodically rolled along

  tom muttered aye denny tis hard
but ive a mind tis not for long i heard
portygee joe and the old man gamming
in the cabin yesterday as i stood my trick
at the wheel through the open skylight
i heard them the squeege islands are
not far off we head toward them our
chance is coming we-

  he stopped and gazed ahead his ex-
pression changed there a few miles
away a white sputter broke the blue ex-
panse of the ocean-a white sputter like
waves cresting over a rock wash no rock
that for it moved along submerged and
rose lifted ten feet above the water a lit-
tle puff of vapor shot up up and out
another a series of three or four scat-
tered  then a dozen of the thin white-gray
tufts rose and disintegrated

  denny saw it at the same time he
tensed himself and drew in a long breath
in another second he would have roused
the ship with his cry of discovery blows
ah blows tom reached across the
mast and grabbed his partner fiercely by
the arm

  be quiet he muttered look nod-
ding his head up toward the bow

  there just showing above the sky line
a tuft of clouds floated below them a
little speck scarce a pencil point of blue
black spotted the indigo water-land be-
tween that scarce-seen spot of land and
the ship a dozen black spots arose minute
yet unmistakable-sperm whales there
came the sun flash  a glistening hump
denny looked back at the two men in the
main rings they were casually survey-
ing the crew below swabbing decks por-
tygee joe was working at the bench aft of
the try-works a couple of harpooners were
sharpening cutting spades on the grind-
stone save for the two of the foremast
head none on the ship had seen the pod of
whales ahead when next denny glanced
forward he caught but a half glimpse of
a couple of upturned flukes

  tom whispered there they go flukes
aye and toward the land toward the
land he repeated aye theyre workin
to windward each time they sound they
get closer to the island


sea stories

  then the whales came lip right ahead a
large school lazily rolling their blows
dotted the oceans surface dead before the
ship not a mile off tom glanced appre-
hensively back to where the other two look-
outs hung in their rings one had his
head pillowed on his arms evidently steal-
ing a cat nap the other lay with his head
and shoulders over the circular guard of
the crows nest idly watching the men on
deck below the whales ahead spouted
regular white tufts of vapor that rose
drifted down the wind and dissipated in
the clear morning sunshine then they
dove

  tom again glanced back muttered
were in luck in luck indeed

  ahead now the land had taken form
the high peak in the center was green with
vegetation how soft and soothing that
green appeared to the sea-weary eyes of
the two a faint almost intangible smell
of growing things of warm moist earth
came to their nostrils right ahead was
the solid earth-clear cool water fruit-
all the things they had lacked for six
months and right ahead was the thing
the ship cruised for sperm whales tom
glanced back in time to see the lookout
who had been dozing raise his head he
saw him stiffen point

  before the other could call tom lifted
his voice

  b-l-o-o-ow-s ah blows he shouted
b-l-o-o-o-w-s thar she blows

  instantly at that yell the men on deck
below galvanized into action questioning
faces turned upward captain forse came
hurrying from below decks bareheaded
his coat off as though lie had been awak-
ened from a nap

  where away he called

  dead ahead sir tom answered a
big pod working toard land

  come down come down the captain
ordered

  a few minutes later tom and denny had
slid down the backstays and got the cov-
ers off the line tubs their boats with
whining creaks swung free and struck the
water the other two boats were a good
cables length astern of them they were
off bellying jib and mainsail after the
whales that surged along leisurely to wind-
ward and to landward luck played right
into toms hands for he sighted a big bull
that trailed after the school as though he
found it hard to keep up close-hauled

the whaleboat gradually came up on him as
he with considerable difficulty surged
along two seas separated them

  portygee joe at the tiller called let
em have it

  tom arose notched his knee into the
clumsy cleat hefted the harpoon glanced
back to where the line ran aft around the
loggerhead then he set himself drew
back two-handed he pitched the iron
it struck with an audible thud right be-
hind the whales flipper a well-directed
cast

  portygee joe at the tiller grunted
good lower sail mens and started to
come forward to use the lance  he
stopped wonder in his eyes the whale
had come up a blurt of crimson spray
blobbed out his spout tom had mortally
wounded the whale with the iron a lucky
shot indeed

  portygee joe yelled dat good works
tom i bet old mans like this all right

  he was right for when the ship drove
up and swung into the wind the old man
leaned over the rail his face usually so
glum and forbidding was wreathed in
smiles

  youre a good man he informed tom
come up come up ive a drink for
you

  tom was surprised at the invitation but
he was astonished a couple of minutes later
as portygee joe burst into the cabin his
eyes round with excitement

  capn he exclaimed i tink we got
ambergree

  captain forse uttered an exclamation
almost of unbelief he hurriedly set his
untouched glass down and rushed from
the cabin

  ambergris ambergris come to an-
chor were in soundings well see
well see he shouted excitedly

  tom calmly drained his glass then up-
ended the captains the grate of the an-
chor chain running through the hawse pipe
sounded he wiped his mouth with the
back of his hand grunted complacently
and then went slowly up on deck where
wild excitement and conjectures raged

  denny ran up to meet him

  tom tom he whispered in a hoarse
chuckling voice aye were fixed now
see he pointed to where captain forse
leaning through the gap where a section
of the bulwarks had been removed laid

sea-
smell of salt horse



down the cutting spade reached below and
brought up a grav-brown mass a clinker-
like lump of ambergris from the gash he
had cut in the sperm whale alongside

  aye tom agreed were fixed in-
dicating the island were fixed ive a
plan this-nodding to where the crew
grouped around the break in the rail-this
is luck indeed for us

  the captain passed grinning broadly
yeve got a nice days wage here he
said then he indicated to tom the square
of canvas that held half a dozen big lumps
of the ambergris a nice days lay for
all hands

  tom watched him go below a grin of
complete satisfaction spreading over his
face then he turned to denny

  come wc must get this job off our
hands

  they helped rig the cutting stage two
planks set out from the side of the ship
another laid across the two a rail over one
side of it on this platform tom and
denny stood chopping at the carcass le-
low them that strung alongside the ship
held by the fluke chain haul and slack
the crew toiled at the windlass heaving
the big strips of blubber up on deck a
fire was started in the try-works and the
operations of cutting up the blanket-pieces
into the squares of horsc-pieces the slicing
of them into bibles-thin cuts held together
by the hide-went on

  by mid-morning a dense black column
of smoke trailed away from the whaler
trailed across the clcan blue ocean and
smudged its dirty streak across the clear
horizon to leeward by noon the job was
finished a poor catch this as far as oil
was concerned the whale that should
have made at least fifty barrels of oil only
tried out thirty yet as the mates and
boat stecrers sat down in the main cabin
eating dinner none complained one who
proudly announced himself a clever mathe-
matician was calculating what the morn-
ings catch would bring him

  a fiftieth lay ive at least a hundred
dollars coming to me he swept his arm
around indicated the other boat headers
sitting on the bench opposite a hundred
dollars each one of us like finding it
on the street and oh the time well have
when once we set foot ashore

  torn grinned at denny the speaker
noticed him

   sea-

  aye tom me bully lad grin ye may
yere in high favor now ive no doubt
he has you in mind for a rich bonus may-
hap hell double your share the old man
would give you anything you ask him
toms expression became calculating
he stirred the greasy mass of lobscouse in
his plate with a grimy forefinger and mut-
tered to denny sitting beside him right
he is

  his nose curled disgusted as he sur-
veyed his food he shoved it away from
him and mumbled in a low voice were
soon through with such as this denny
but how tom denny asked as they
left the cabin

  just you wait twill not be long in
coming now when an opportune time
comes the old man himself will be the
means of our getting ashore tom re-
plied much to his partners mystification

jfbjt was late in the afternoon before
eg captain forse came on deck the

-- crew were busy cleaning up broom

and pail with holystone and swab the
decks were being cleared of oil and gurry

  tom touched his cap respectfully cap-
tain ive a favor to request

  captain forse eyed him shrewdly tom
noticing the expression on the captains
face was quick to explain

  theres fish aplenty right around us

i noticed big schools as we went  the
whale this morning how is it for denny
and myself to take a boat just off the ship
sir a mess-ill promise to bring a mess
aboard in an hour or so tis bound to be
fine fishing just at sundown

  perhaps captain forses private store of
food was running low he was in a genial
mood he had just weighed the ambergris
 his steelyard in the cabin a hundred
pounds it tallied hed make a good voy-
age this trip even if he did not take another
gill of oil

  besides what inducement was there for 
tom and denny to jump ship that bit
of an island set in the immensity of the
pacific far from any other land out of
the track of vessels what sane man would
maroon himself on it what sane man
who had just made a grand days pay
would give it up he surveyed the island
saw the reef encircling it and looked
sharply at the two before him then he
nodded

  they wasted no time down into their


sea stories

tiny stateroom off the main cabin they
hurried underneath their donkeys break-
fasts-the straw-filled mattresses over the
seats of their berths-was their store they
had been secretly collecting for months
marline and sail twine palm and needles a
couple of sheath knives flint and steel an
ax and adz head stolen from the carpen-
ter tom peeled off his shirt denny
carefully wrapped a long strip of canvas
around his body bulky tom looked his
pockets suspiciously bulging their prep-
arations were soon made denny shifted
the coil of light lance warp he carried over
his shoulder under his shirt

  i f any one had taken the trouble to study
the two closely when they came on deck
it would have been plain that they had
suddenly both acquired breadth across the
shoulders and girth around the middle
but none of the officers paid the slightest
attention to them tom called a couple
of the crew to help lower a boat a few
seconds later the bearers had been swung
clear and in the sweet squeal from the
davit blocks they were free

  with clumsy oars they pulled away from
the ship white-faced with suppressed ex-
citement trembling with eagerness ri-
diculously easy their escape denny after
they had gotten a couple of hundred yards
away voiced the probable reason he nod-
ded his head to where the surf crashed
and foamed over the reef

  aye tom he said how are we
to jump that and get ashore

  tom set his doubts at ease aye
denny captain forse no doubt had that
same thought in mind when he so readily
gave us permission to leave the ship but
-tom winked-i know what he doesnt
from the masthead this morning i saw
just around yon pint ahead i saw a
break tis there we go through
denny was all for making the attempt
at once but tom cautioned him to curb
his impatience

  the sun will soon set and darkness will
whisk down on us then we will make it
successful wi no fear of early pursuit
the sun even then lipped the edge of
the horizon blood-red like a globe of
molten iron it rolled slowly into the sea
and was extinguished

now tom grunted as he bent the
oar now he repeated were gone
five minutes later they shot through the
gap in the reef drove across the lagoon

and grounded on a pebbly beach tom
took the boats hatchet and a short-handled
cutting spade as he hurriedly picked up
the spade the wooden guard slipped from
its edge razor sharp the blade cut him
across his forearm it was not a deep cut
but one that bled freely denny was all
concern over the accident tom took this
misfortune lightly however and with quick
wit turned it to his advantage he dripped
blood over the thwarts along the gunwale
and let a puddle spatter on the floor boards
of the whaleboat ere the flow ceased
the boat was well marked with the glisten-
ing crimson spots then he set the anchor
shackle carried for mooring weight bal-
anced it carefully in the notch inthe bow
and coiled the anchor warp neatly on the
floor boards wading out in the water he
shoved the boat clear the offshore wind
caught it and it drifted out into the fast-
gathering darkness

  he came ashore chuckling the be-
ginnings of a fine mystery goes out there
he said the weight will drop free and
anchor the boat when she strikes the rough
water on the reef theyll find it wi all
the signs of a hard-fought battle aye
denny were numbered already among
those who have mysteriously vanished
without a trace without a trace he
repeated as on hands and knees he crawled
backward obliterating all signs of their
footmarks on the beach

half hour later the two sitting
on the slope of the hill far above the
beach saw the dancing flares swing-
ing over the water a loud shout welled
up

  theyve found the boat  om an-
nounced theyll make no attempt to
come ashore to-night and to-morrow we
will easily elude them to-morrow aye
he chuckled triumphantly to-morrow
we will be our own men this night we
are free and fof all the nights and days
to come

  aye denny agreed in a deep thought-
ful voice all to come

  they made their bed of palm branches
and moss up on the slope of the mountain
and slept peacefully all night at the sud-
den break of dawn next morning they
aroused in time to see two boats drop
down from the davits and pull toward
shore silently they watched the white
whaleboats like long slim water beetles
smell of salt horse



inch along the edge of the reef and move
through the gap one lay off a few yards
its crew holding ready muskets the other
drove up to the beach the crew armed
with cutting spades and boarding knives
came ashore portygee joe led the way
cautiously peering into the fringe of the
jungle that grew thick and rank almost
down to the waters edge their search
was brief and casual in a half hour the
boats left were rowed back to the bark
and a few moments after they had been
hauled up the clank-clank of the anchor
chain and the rattle of the windlass pawl
sounded	

  by the time the sun was an hour high
the finback had made sail and was a toy
ship oil to the northward-a toy ship that
gently imperceptibly dropped down below
the seas edge her courses sunk from
sight then her topsails her main-top-
gallant a little sooty square of canvas
alone remained etched against the blue of
a far horizon one second it was there
and the next it too had gone

  the two deserters faced each other

  aye tom spoke after a long silence
aye weve outwitted the old man now
to make ourselves comfortable now to ex-
plore a bit

  the rest of the day they spent in tramp-
ing over the half-obliterated paths that
crisscrossed the island by noon they had
learned that it was uninhabited by night-
fall the reason for this fertile spot being
without a human life became suddenly ap-
parent for never a sign of pig nor goat
met their eyes on the stone platforms
where houses once had stood they found
numbers of charred bones and coconut
shells aplenty tom late that afternoon
sat down on a big piece of coral overlook-
ing the sea

  were alone denny alone he re-
peated the natives have killed off the
meat and had a big celebration and left
but why i cant tell

  as he spoke from far off a rolling rum-
ble sounded the ground trembled the
tops of a group of leaning palm trees sud-
denly became violently agitated the
heavy thuds of dropping coconuts came
from the grove to one side then quiet-
ness again fell-quietness broken by the
low steady roar of the surf crashing
against the reef and the rustling of the
palm fronds in the sweep of the trade
winds there was no need to question

what that sullen rumble denoted both
knew	

  they simultaneously glanced back up at
the peak high above and saw what they exr
pected a big cloud of blue-gray smoke
lipped the stark knob a red glare showed
through a rift in the clouds for a moment
and as suddenly vanished their island
was a volcano which apparently showed
moments of activity that then accounted
for its desertion

  denny spoke timorously hesitant pert
haps tom perhaps we-we-

  his partner interrupted him  tis noth-
ing a little shake no danger his
words lacked force and denny noted their
tremulous half-hearted manner

  yet they had made the jump they had
no choice now but to stay where they
landed and make the best of it both were
industrious and set to work inside of a
week they had cleared a place up on a level
bench on the hillside and had built a hut

  then they began to construct a boat
they found a large log rolled it down to
the beach and started to shape it at first
they worked hard spending long hours
laboriously hewing the tough wood then
as the days passed other things seemed
more important a swim a bit of fishing
finally they ceased making excuses they
had fallen under the spell of the tropics
they rested in the shade to work to
struggle and why it all seemed so fu-
tile now there was no need to labor to
procure food fruit and coconuts were
to be had for the mere reaching out of a
hand fish the ebbing tide always left
scores flopping in the shallow pools
stranded by the falling water the big
sea turtles crawled up on the beach 
moonlight nights to lay their eggs small
effort to turn one over on her back life
was indeed simple and carefree here under
the sweep of the trade wind on this speck
of land out in the center of the wide ocean

  their first scare when the volcano rum-
bled had gone for never another sign
of life came from that high cone above
them and they no longer looked for visi-
tors no longer searched the sea for a sight
of canoe for as day followed day the
blue smiling ocean was barren of sail or
boat it was as though nothing ever had
floated on its surface since time began
and time itself-they had stopped reckon-
ing the days for two months tom had
notched a stick each morning then even


sea stories

that had become too much of an effort
of what use a day a month a year
what difference did it make

  their tobacco came to an end that was
hard to do without but they soon came to
seldom think of smoking as tom had
promised denny long ago there was nei-
ther spring nor summer fall nor winter
here a monotonous succession of sunrises
and sunsets the moon waxed and waned
the wind always swept across the island
from the same direction the afternoon
showers always poured down at the same
time each day the twro who at first had
been so active and industrious now did
nothing clothes they had quit wearing
they hung damp sagging limp bundles
on pegs in their grass house their shoes
green-molded set in a corner a canvas
breechclout was the sole garment of either
they grew soft from inaction bronzed
copper-colored from the burning rays of
the sun

  even speech became an effort they
often sat in the shade of the palm trees
gazing out over the reef out to where the
world of water met the bowl of the sky
sat for long hours without a word with
scarce a movement dreaming chins cupped
in hands-dreaming of a world that lay
off beyond the sky line a world whose
memories were growing dim and vague

  it might have been six months perhaps
seven-neither knew for certain since that
evening when they had deserted the fin-
back they lay on the warm sand gazing
out to where the sun was setting the
point that made out from the island was
bathed in sunlight behind them a purpling
vista spread beneath the shadow of the
grove of coconut palms the trade wind
with the falling of evening was dying
the palms that had struggled with bending
trunks and rustling tops all day against
the shove of the wind shivered their dried
leaves gently a coconut fell in the grove
behind them with a heavy thud high
overhead a frigate bird as though sus-
pended on a string circled round and
round in lazy spirals on motionless wings

  suddenly tom with a movement star-
tling in its abruptness leaped to his feet
he stood leaning forward tense rigid
like a bronze statue

  hoarse vibrant his voice arose salt
horse-i smell salt horse a-bilin

  denny thinking that tom had lost his
reason tried to calm him

  now now tom be you seated  take
it-

  abruptly his words stopped his eyes
grew round in wonder open-mouthed
he stared just beyond the rocks before
them a jib boom poked lengthened a
bowsprit followed the dolphin striker ris-
ing and falling gently a triangular piece
of canvas fluttered down the stay the bow
of a ship came into view a hoarse clat-
tering rumble of the anchor chain grating
through the hawse pipe raised a screaming
cloud of sea birds that had come to roost
among the rocks for the night

  in an unbelieving voice denny said
the finback

  his nostrils spread assailed by the pun-
gent briny odor of boiling salt beef tom
stood motionless for a moment then
walked slowly away denny watched him
disappear into the shadow of the trees go-
ing toward their hut he shook his head

  poor tom he muttered aloud he
takes it hard he regrets gettin me into this
but ill not give way hell never know
ive longed for the ship many a time

tbhbi half hour later darkness had
kail swept over the island slowly denny
went up the path he came to the
hut his mind was all made up hed
not fail his partner tom need not go back
to the life he loathed on his account hed
stay here with him with never a word to
tell of his longings

  tom he called softly

  no answer

  tom the mournful cry of a night
bird was the only reply

  denny reached inside the door of their
hut reached into the corner where toms
clothes hung they were gone

  five minutes later denny had dressed
and was swimming out to the ship he
caught hold of the main chain plates and
started to haul himself aboard he
stopped toms voice arose

  they came on us sudden and unex-
pected we knew nothing till we came to
bound and helpless on the island aye
bound and helpless and destined for a sav-
age banquet but we outwitted them
denny and i after you sailed they had
a jamboree drunk they got all of them
aye and denny and i worked free o our
bonds we tied them up piled them in
their canoe and set it afloat wi a hole in
the bottom it sunk off the reef and
smell of salt horse



now captain-toms voice took on a
pleading note-come let me have a crew
go ashore and bring denny back a bit

touched wi the solitude he be a bit-

  captain forses voice raised sardon-
ically he laughed

  a likely tale a yarn to delude old
women i take no stock in it you both
jumped ship you both lose your lays
not a penny do you get when we arrive
home as to him-he turned and pointed
to where dennys head stuck over the rail
-and to you he spoke to tom youre
disrated go forward ive shipped boat
steerers in your places i took them on at
honolulu

  he turned on his heel and walked away
  shortly after tom and denny crouched

down in the lee of the bulwarks forward
they had begged the cook for a meal
tom reached down into his wooden mess
kit and pulled out a piece of salt beef
he bit deep into the tough stringy meat

  aye denny he muttered compla-
cently salt horse and lobscousc tis hard
to beat

  aye denny agreed as he flipped a
biscuit against the capstan knocking out
the weevils aye salt horse and lobscousc
the natural food of men

  they lit up their pipes stretched out on
the deck and smoked peacefully

  down in the captains quarters aft por-
tygee joe chuckled

  salt horse the smell of him raise em
quick like you say eh capll

  by eric h wilkinson

         a subsurface swashbuckler of the south seas

iailors whose observation is
j necessarily keener than that of
other men and who have to name
 the wonders they encounter for
future reference have always called him
the swordfish-when they did not call him
something worse-and they have known
him for a long time-a very long time

  doubtless in prehistoric ages the cro-
magnons drifting round the coast of
spain in their frail cockleshells knew him
although since the sword had not yet come
into use as an offensive weapon they
probably called him the equivalent of the-
fish-to-be-avoided-if-possible

  later the phoenicians the founders of
the mercantile marine became quite famil-
iar with him-not too familiar for they
took care to give him as wide a berth as
possible and perhaps the cretans the
first to develop fighting ships learned a
wrinkle or two in tactics from him and
equipped their ships with rams conceived
in flattering imitation of his sword stout-
based sharp-tipped and serrated on the

lower edge to prevent the prey from escap-
ing when once impaled

  to-day armed with harpoons mediter-
ranean fishing fleets hunt for him for his
flesh is very palatable and the sword
varnished and made up into such vanities
as walking sticks or fire-guard supports
will always fetch a few pieces of silver
from curio-hunting tourists

  even so the hunted will sometimes turn
on the hunter and woe betide the light
fishing smack or dinghy once a full-grown
swordfish has decided to attack imagine
a three-foot spike as solid and unbreakable
as ivory and driven by the combined force
of ten men each armed with a sledge ham-
mer what chance has a small boat against
such a weapon which can and has been
known to pierce the hull of a four-masted
ship

  take nine feet of bone and muscle
weighing some six hundred pounds driven
by a strength greater in proportion than
that of any other fish-equip it with the
above weapon which is really a prolonga-
tion of the skull and so part of the rugged
frame and not merely attached-add a
furious temper and utter lack of fear and
you have the mediterranean or atlantic
swordfish double all this including the
fearlessness and temper and you have the
giant swordfish of the indo-pacific

  mitafri the natives of the south seas
called him perhaps some scientist had
tried to teach them his classical name and
this was the nearest pronunciation they
could get to histiophorus xiphias his-
iiophoru-s his original home as a young-
ster was new zealand or rather the
densely populated waters around the coast
of the north island where even when
quite small he wrought havoc among the
schools of mullet and lesser fry

  scorning carrion for he was no scav-
enger and preferred to kill his own food
he began hunting at a very early ager
thereby developing the wonderful strength
and speed which later was to be both dan-
ger and salvation to him nor did he have
many enemies except those which his own
quick temper and utter fearlessness in-
curred sharks he despised they were
arrant cowards as a rule although they
could occasionally put up a fair fight when
forced to it but they were garbage
hounds preferring the leavings of others
to hunting their own poor trash

  perhaps his dislike was partly due to
the fact that they were a humble relation
of his claiming kinship on account of the

similarity of their skins-scaleless leathery
skins-in the case of the sharks so rough
that it was like the surface of a wood rasp
but here all similarity ended excluding
of course his sword mitafri was heavier
and stockier in proportion his remark-
able tail unlike the more or less single
tapering affair belonging to the shark fam-
ily was bifurcated from base to tip a
design to which he partly owed the unerr-
ing aim and speed of his charges his
dorsal fin instead of being the compara-
tively small triangular-shaped wredge as in
the shark tribe extended the whole length
of his back and when hoisted equaled in
height the diameter of his body the
extraordinary size and his use of this fin
has gained for him his other though less
popular name of sailfish

  one fine morning-fine for that coast
of fierce gales and mighty seas-mitafri
was taking a little cruise his sail spread
to its full extent to catch a light easterly
breeze which without any effort on his
part but a slight adjustment of his rudder
carried him at about four or five knots
down the coast now and then he caught
sight of a wandering kau and other
smaller fish which had he wanted he
could have taken easily but this morning
he had hopes of surprising a school of
mullet his favorite sport and incidentally
his preference on the menu

  once a huge black shadow glided across
his course many feet below him and


sea stories

mitafri imperceptibly checked his speed
ready lo dart aside should the giant stinga-
rcc suspect that the apparently lifeless
piece of driftwood above him was worth
while investigating mitafri had seen a
fight between one of his own people and a
stingaree and before the sharks had de-
molished the victim he had come close
enough to observe the hideous wounds
which the giant sea bats scorpionlike tail
had inflicted on the loser-observed and
taken notice for future reference

  pugnacious little ruffian though he was
even at that early age he was no fool and
he realized glumly that his experience as
yet was not sufficient to cope with a fish
-at least he supposed it was a fish any-
way it swam-which recognized no rules
of the game but fought with its tail

  somewhat relieved when the stingaree
vanished as mysteriously as it had ap-
peared mitafri hoisted sail again and pro-
ceeded on his course suddenly as he
rounded a point he came upon a school
of mullet playing in the sheltered waters
of a little bay

  as he had hoped his arrival was a com-
plete surprise to the school fish are very
sensitive not only to sight but to vibra-
tion had mitafri been hurrying they
would doubtless have heard or rather felt
him even before they saw him but his
effortless approach little more than drift-
ing deceived the sentinels of the school
until he was almost among them reefing
his sail with a snap which added impetus
to his charge mitafri drove headlong at
the school with such speed and deadly aim
that he impaled three victims on his two-
foot skewer before the school broke up
in fluttering panic and scattered to the four
currents

  quite satisfied with the result mitafri
shook his victims off-not such an easy
job for the lower edge of his sword was
serrated the rudimentary remains of what
in ages past had been teeth-and leisurely
dined nevertheless he kept his eyes
open as a silver streak emerged from the
shelter of the point and hurtled past him
after the scattered mullet but the latter
had already gained cover and the silver
streak a stalking barracuda which had
been biding his time waiting for the mullet
to come a bit closer to him returned bit-
terly disappointed to his post seeing
mitafri and knowing that he was the cause
of his discomfiture the sea tiger paused

baring his teeth and twitching his tail an-
grily

  mitafri was quite ready gulping down
the third mullet with a relish calculated to
goad his rival still further he swung
around until his sword pointed directly at
the crouching tiger in fact had the bar-
racuda delayed another instant mitafri
would probably have attacked first but
the former though furious was not yet
ready to commit suicide he was no cow-
ard  in fact next to mitafri he was the
fiercest and most reckless of all sea fish
but mitafri had the advantage-a deadly
sharp two-foot advantage plus extra
weightfor the sea pike would have scaled
sixty-odd pounds whereas mitafri was
nearer a hundred by now

  with a soundss snarl the luckless sea
tiger darted-obliquely so that if mitafri
attacked his aim would be more difficult-
into the shelter of a submarine cavern be-
hind the point

  rather disappointed for he was spoiling
for a fight mitafri circled slowly and
tauntingly in front of the cave mouth but
finding that he could not tempt the barra-
cuda to try conclusions with him he de-
parted leaving a piece of mullet tail for
the barracuda to see by way of a kindly
afterthought barracudas are not scav-
engers either and bitterly resent such an
imputation

  his own temper which was exceed-
ingly short beginning to rise at the thought
of losing an enjoyable fight he sullenly
toured around the little bay although he
knew the scattered mullet would have given
warning and no game was likely to be
found the appearance of what at first
sight he took to be a piece of driftwood
but which presently he saw could appar-
ently move slowly in any direction it de-
sired provoked his easily aroused curios-
ity and he swam over for a closer inspec-
tion

  only its size-although but little wider
it was almost three times his own length-
prevented him from attacking immediately
moreover its extreme slowness made him
suspicious the stingaree had taught him
that it was well to know an enemy op-
ponents tactics before starting anything
as nothing further happened in fact
from its increased speed it seemed that
the creature was feebly trying to escape
from him if possible mitafri made a com-
plete circle around it-just to be sure that
mitafri



there was no funny stuff-before he
charged

  suddenly his attention was drawn to a
small shiny object about three inches long
-in reality a fishing spinner of pearl shell
-which bobbed and sidled behind the
creature gradually drawing closer to it
yet apparently quite unconcerned at mita-
fris approach

  mitafri was annoyed then enraged ac-
cording to all previous experience this
miserable little fish should have dashed
away in panic at his approach but in-
stead of that it bobbed leisurely along
as if trusting in the protection of the big-
ger crcaturc it was actually trying to
mock him

  protection huh snapping down his
sail mitafri charged his sword striking
the canoe squarely in the middle just at
the water line

  had the maori fisherman not been sit-
ting in the stern he might have received
a serious if not fatal injury for mitafris
sword penetrated the shell of the canoe up
to its hilt this was the fishermans sal-
vation for as he dived overboard and
struck out desperately for the shore some
two hundred yards away mitafri was too
occupied in extricating himself from the
wrecked canoe which clung persistently
around his nose to notice anything else

  at first he backed away but the canoe
though nearly waterlogged was so light
that its resistance was not sufficient for the
serrated saw to disengage itself fright-
ened for the first time in his life he tried
shaking himself like a fog with no more
success for the canoe merely gave with
him without the hole becoming enlarged
tt was lucky for him that the barracuda
did not come out to investigate tlie dis-
turbance for he was completely disarmed
and helpless

  perhaps some thought such as this may
have entered his head for thoroughly
panic-stricken by now he made for the
shelter of the rocky point on the farther
side of the bay this was his salvation
for as he tried to back into a deep shelter
the ends of the canoe caught on the rocks
and with this leverage to pull against
mitafri easily rid himself of his encum-
brance  so easily that he sat somewhat
violently against the unyielding rocks be-
hind him

  finding himself free he made for the
outer sea the wide-open spaces where fish

are fish-in fact never again did he hunt
so close to the shore

  soon his spirits returned fear was un-
natural to him and he never stayed long
but remembrance of the canoe remained
apparently there were some things so
darned helpless that they were positively
dangerous

  lunch off a sea trout a rare but deli-
cious course completely restored his self-
confidence and he ventured on southward

few days later he came to another
bay so deep and wide that the shore
in the center was almost invisible
from midway between the two points
here he encountered a small outward-
bound steamer

  mitafri eyed it suspiciously appar-
ently though a thousand times bigger its
habits were somewhat similar to the help-
less creature which had given him such a
shock it never dived but moved slowly
on top of the surface with such labored
effort that the vibration could be felt for
miles around nor on seeing him did it
veer from its course cither toward or
away from him moreover a couplc of
sharks were following it within easy charg-
ing distance so that there could be no dan-
ger whatever from the thing itself only
from its sheer darned helplessness no
doubt

  mitafri scowled as it passed him hor-
ribly tempted to give it a vicious jab but
prudently restrained himself the revolv-
ing and pulsing of the screws puzzled him 
he could understand a creatures motive
power being in its tail-that was only
natural-but why make such a fuss about
it

  one or two similar creatures little larger
than the canoe but white in color were
also moving about the bay sluggishly
driven by their tails however none of
the other fish seemed to mind them in
fact the mullet were fairly plentiful but
so scattered that catching them was not
easy urged on by his insatiable appetite
mitafri persevered with fair success

  once he spotted a mullet alive but either
injured or oblivious of any danger so
slowly was it moving still hungry or else
he might have been more suspicious
mitafri made for it not troubling to spear
such an easy captive but seizing it in his
jaws a sharp prick in the side of his
mouth annoyed rather than alarmed him


sea stories

and he discovered that to the mullet was
attached a piece of weed so thin and yet
so tough that he could not bite through it
with the idea of shaking it off mitafri
broke water

look out sir youve hooked a small
tin said one of the men of the launch

the other a lean sun-browned man
seated aft in a pivoting chair nodded
frowning as he hastily examined his reel
i know-this confounded reel is going

to jam again im afraid its-

  hes off sir hes off

  mitafri had been surprised and still more
annoyed at his failure to shake off the
weed then suddenly finding that not only
had the pain in his mouth increased but
that he was slowly yet surely moving
against his will toward the launch he
turned and with all the speed and strength
of which he was capable dashed blindly
in the opposite direction

  not until he began to tire did he again
feel that weak but insistent pull on his
mouth then for a second time fear came
to his rescue and lent him strength to con-
tinue his headlong rush

  then there came a jerk which turned
him almost completely around in his tracks
followed by a fierce stabbing pain in his
mouth a moment later he realized that
he was free the weed was gone and with
it that intolerable persistent pull toward the
launch a quick dive and he was down
far down in the shadowy depths where he
could fill his panting gills and aching
mouth with refreshingly ice-cold water

  lost him-thanks to this damn reel
sighed the lean sun-browned man resign-
edly sporting little chap too id like
to get into him again some day

  perhaps it was lucky for some launch
that mitafris experience of them at such
an early age had been so unpleasant-he
connected the clinging weed as being due
in some way to the launch doubtless he
would have been caught sooner or later
but had lie been hooked again his fury
would have made him charge and even
a motor launch is not improved by being
perforated in the hull

  as it was mitafri left-hurriedly-for
the north again he had had enough ad-
ventures for the time being and here far
from the popular fishing grounds in fact
out of the course of any ship save an occa-
sional coastal tramp or trading schooner
he grew and thrived

op several years he led a quiet and
uneventful life making an occasional
hundred-mile iaunt-but never
southward-and usually in the mating
season for swordfish when seen far from
land are generally in couples as time
went on he found it more and more diffi-
cult to satisfy his appetite which increased
in ratio to his size at last he decided to
pull up stakes and move to more populous
waters where the fish were bigger and
would not necessitate so many per square
meal

  iy this time he was about thirteen feet
in length of which the sword comprised
three tenths and weighed over a thou-
sand pounds  lis dorsal sail which as
a youngster had been all one piece was
now divided into two-the sign of matur-
ity a magnificent specimen of pacific
swordfish

  mitafri at first had no definite ideas as
to his ultimate destination but his local
forages had taught him that the farther
north the better hunting and so one
fine morning in january-midsummer in
the south-he set out heading north by
east accompanied by a stalwart matron
who had been won in a glorious fight for
like that other game fish the salmon
swordfish are temporarily monogamous

  for two or three weeks they proceeded
leisurely through the rapidly warming wa-
ter sailing whenever the wind permitted
and taking the lower trails when the sur-
face conditions were unfavorable

  to keep in trim they chased schools of
flying fish whose proportionately huge lat-
eral fins like wings enabled them to elude
their pursuers by skipping from swell to
swell just above the surface occasionally
they managed to impale one before it could
take to the air or was too exhausted to
fly for any distance blit stripped of their
wings they were little larger than a her-
ring and even bonier and decidedly less
palatable

  a couple of hundred miles past fiji they
saw in the distance a big bull whale which
had been cut off from the main herd by
a school of killer whales who set on the
brute whenever he came up for air like
a pack of wolves attacking a giant elk but
the whale though sorely harassed was
still strong the furious killers could do
little damage to him below the surface
in fact they rarely tried and on his brief
trips to the surface for air they had a
mitafri



hard time of it at first the powerful
brute would occasionally catch a luckless
thirty-foot killer and with a flip of his
mighty flukes hurl it with stunning force
to fall some fifty yards or so away

  mitafri quivered with anticipation as he
took in the details of the fight although
he had never encountered a whale before
age-old instinct told him that he was needed
here and what to do followed by his
wife he dived until he reached a point
some twenty fathoms immediately below
the giant cetacean

  the next time the brute dived to escape
the furies the two swordfish attacked him
from below burying their swords to the
hilts in the descending mountain of flesh
easily extricating themselves afterward
with a twist from the soft yielding blub-
ber

  goaded by these stings the unhappy
whale rose hastily to the surface only to
be driven down again by the waiting pack
half a dozen times he tried to submerge
each time his dive becoming shallower as
mitafri and his wife seeing their victim
weaken grew bolder and lessened the
length of their charge

  at last the whale exhausted with his
efforts and wounds floated dying on the
surface and the pack closed in tearing the
still-quivering bulk to pieces mitafri and
his wife joined in the feast unmolested by
the killers who seemed to recognize the
assistance they had given although a
greedy shark one of a horde who were
prudently waiting until the slayers had fin-
ished paid with his life for his impatience

  gorged with this rich meal mitafri was
thankful to be able to set sail and travel
without much exertion on his part for the
next day or so twice more during his
voyage he encountered and was lucky
enough to assist killers each resulting ban-
quet making him more and more deter-
mined to push on in spite of the remon-
strances of his wife who for the sake of
the future generation was anxious to make
shoal waters

  at last he came to a pass between- two
islands a very deep pass about four miles
wide through which traveling hordes of
fish made use of the strong currents
bounding the pass and surrounding the
islands were coral reefs beyond which 
an occasional foray in search of o fee
the octopus a new and delightful delicacy
which he had discovered during his voy-

age he caught a glimpse of canoes drifting
on the lagoon although he never ven
tured into the lagoons it was from no fear
of the canoes even if he had remembered
the incident of his younger days his
strength and size were now so great that
to demolish a canoe would be but the work
of a second but mitafri was by preferr
ence a deep-sea fish his hulk and charg-
ing tactics demanded plenty of room
moreover each time he ventured close to
the coral cliffs he had the same imprisoned
feeling which a backwoodsman experiences
when visiting a city

  however mitafri decided that this par-
ticular corner of the ocean was as near to
his ideal as he could ever hope to find a
sea of eternal summer tempered with oc-
casional rains and winds which compared
to those in the far south were but little
more than sailing breezes nor was it
attacked by that dread menace of the trop-
ics the hurricane he was soon joined
by other swordfish seeking a marine
utopia at least they also hunted the
pass but refrained from getting too close
to mitafri his temper and size precluded
any attempt at sociability however there
were plenty of teraihi and paiheri besides
countless other smaller courses  the
menu so provided they did not interfere
with him he was content to suffer their
presence

tgs the years passed although he had
long since reached maturity mitafri

- still increased in size until he was

almost three quarters of a ton in weight
seventeen feet of steel-muscled undisputed
power king of the seas demanding and
receiving tribute by reason of his five-foot
scepter rarely did he have to use it as
a sword now the mere sight of it being
sufficient to scatter in panic the most un-
ruly of his subjects

  one day as he loafed through a sap-
phire sea so calm that except for the eter-
nal pacific swell it might have been some
huge landlocked lagoon he passed near a
trim white launch mitafri scarcely heeded
it except to notice that it was somewhat
out of its course he was accustomed to
seeing the daily passenger and mail
launches from tahiti to moorea laboriously
breast the swells and choppy seas off
cooks point they never interfered with
him nor even spoiled his hunting neither
did the occasional liner or copra schooners


sea stories

hurrying through the pass on their own
business

  but what did attract his attention was
the peculiar antics of a fair-sized paiheri
a large and very succulent variety of mack-
erel to which he was particularly addicted
paying no heed to the awful presence of
his majesty the paiheri cavorted and
bounded about like some playful little trout
at the first fly hatch of the season instead
of concentrating his energies on the usual
single-minded dash for safety

  mitafris sight may have weakened but
it is more likely that his absolute suprem-
acy had obviated any need for suspicion
whatever the reason he failed to notice
the slender strand of copper wire attached
to the paiheri

  displeased with such impudent frivolity
more especially since he was quite in the
mood for the gentle exercise which nor-
mally preceded a light snack of this sort
he gulped down the offender and then-

  perhaps the almost insignificant prick
of the hook may have struck some dim cord
in his memory certainly the tautening
of the line in a feeble strain of some
fifty pounds or so was no more than a
slight discomfort to him and had about
as much effect in controlling his move-
ments as a clothesline would have on a
wild elephant

  for a moment he lay still literally para-
lyzed so great was the shock of anger at
the realization that he mitafri king of
the sea had been subject to such an enor-
mity then his fury tempered by the
absurdity of attempting to hamper his
movements or freedom he dived-not the
blind panic-stricken dash of the past but
a steady downward glide wonderfully fast
in spite of the lack of effort

  on board the launch a lean sunburned
man whose dark hair was now graying
slightly about the temples tensed as the
screech of the reel shrilled a call for ac-
tion and a smile flickered for an instant
across his tightly compressed lips the grim
smile of a fighter who has met a worthy
opponent

  for several seconds the reel an enor-
mous affair capable of holding several hun-
dred yards of line howled with protest
against such terrific speed and the fighter
frowned as he saw that his reserves of
line were rapidly becoming exhausted
soon to his relief the howl of the tor-
tured brakes diminished to a creaking pur

and finally stopped there is a limit to
which even such a giant as mitafri may
descend for though a deep-sea fish he
was a surface hunter his lungs were not
constructed to withstand the enormous
pressure of the lower depths any more
than those of a man will permit him to
ascend far into the rarified atmosphere
above

  winded by his effort mitafri rose
slowly at first and then astounded that
the slight but persistent pull on his head
still remained his fury got the better of
his reason had he continued to swim
leisurely away from the launch it would
have been but a matter of seconds until
he was free as it was he rose-rose with
a superb rush which carried him twenty
feet out of the water where for the frac-
tion of a second he poised his body arched
in mid-air shaking his head with a magnifi-
cent fury wonderful to see to fall with a
splash which sent inquisitive spectators
darting to cover then changing his tac-
tics he tore off at right angles with all
the speed of which he was capable and
dived

  but the lean sunburned man had also
learned a lot more than any other whose
favorite sport was big-game fishing many
a time single-handed he had fought and
beaten a fish five times his own weight
fighting it with rod and line which he
himself could easily have broken had he
wished

  as mitafri rose his enemy rapidly and
skillfully reeled in the slack so that when
mitafri returned from his brief flight to
his own element once more he still felt
that slight check maddening in its terri-
ble persistency once more he broke wa-
ter only to fail in his purpose

  heavens ejaculated a friend of the
hunters who had been driven speechless
by mitafris first appearance what a
whopper what a whopper youll never
tire him out gray shall i lend you a
hand 

  no said the hunter firmly its be-
tween him and me

  it seemed almost as if mitafri heard
him or perhaps it was just the spirit of
one fighter calling to another-at any rate
there ensued a battle royal worthy of any
king an age-old struggle in which man
pitted his skill and wits against brute
strength for three long hours mitafri
tried every trick he knew but always the
mitafri

g

hunter managed to maintain bis bold al-
though the sweat poured from him and the
lines of his face betrayed the agony which
the constant strain on his arms exacted

  but mitafri was in even worse shape
just as a comparatively light weight be-
comes an intolerable burden after a time
so had the slight pull on his head become
a resistless drag to which exhausted by
his own futile efforts to escape it he was
gradually succumbing

  at last after summoning all his failing
strength for one final dash for freedom
he lay spent and beaten on the surface
had he known it he was within an ace
of freedom for this last charge had taken
him a quarter of a mile from the launch
and but a few scant yards of line remained
on the reel

  quick gasped the hunter to his
friend that other spool-ill splice it
on hes beat i think but i darent pull
on him or he may have another spurt left
in him

  still maintaining the strain the hunter
began to attach the extra line but just as
the actual splicing began he was forced to
relax the strain for a moment or two
mitafri rolling helplessly on the surface
subconsciously felt the strain relax and
although he was past caring some instinct
not waiting for orders urged him to a
feeble switch of his tail sufficient to carry
him on only for a few yards farther but
enough

  in vain the hunter made a grab at the
line as it slipped through the guiding rings
of his rod had he caught it he might
still have won for mitafri had not the
strength of an average salmon by now as

it was the line went overboard where it
floated tantalizingly on the surface just out
of reach and then as mitafri mechani-
cally dived a poor weak effort more like
a gradual submerging than a dive both
line and fish vanished

  lord-what rotten luck you had
him-ill swear you had him groaned the
friend whose disappointment seemed
greater than that of the hunter himself

  y-yes but you see-i didnt said
the latter sadly relaxing with a sigh of
relief for he was very very tired

  i wonder the brute didnt charge the
launch though i suppose we would have
got him if he had observed the friend
still it wouldnt have done the launch
any good

  the hunter smiled a successful writer
whose stories were known the world over
the loss of a launch would not have dis-
tressed him much in fact he would cheer-
fully have sacrificed the value of a launch
for the chance of another bout with
mitafri

  no it wouldnt he admitted but
im glad he didnt-id have hated to have
to harpoon the old boy no jim it was a
good fight and the best man won but
he added wistfully it isnt often that
one has the chance of getting into such a
fish must have been around fifteen hun-
dred i should judge jim i wonder-i
wonder if hell give me another go at
him 

  i doubt it said the friend but could
the game old king slowly recovering his
strength in the cool depths have heard
it is more than probable he would have
accepted the challenge

adventures of an african

by captain canot	slaver

    synopsis of preceding chapters
theodore canot a young italian
seaman early in the last century fell in
with a band of wreckers on the cuban coast
escaping from them he entered the slave
trade sailing first as mate and then oper-
ating as an independent trader on the slave
coast on a trip to the interior after slaves
he wins the friendship of a powerful chief
who is a great aid to him

  returning to his factory he was captured
by the captain of a french ship but was
subsequently released by the captain of a
spanish schooner the captain died soon
afterward and theodore decided to take his
ship to sea he succeeded in this design
but was captured by a british cruiser whose
captain set him adrift thirty miles off the
coast after various adventures he made
his way back to his own factory but the
baracoons were burned shortly after his
arrival

  as his fortunes were then at a low ebb he
decided to take a cargo to cuba which he
was successful in doing and realized a good
profit on it then he joined a french slaver
that was trading to the mozambique chan-
nel after many vicissitudes they com-
pleted the voyage narrowly escaping cap-
ture by a strange cruiser

chapter xxxit

ohe beneficent disposition of my
late commander though not a
regular testament was carried
- out in cuba and put me in pos-
session of twelve thousand dollars as my
share of the enterprise yet my restless
spirit did not allow me to remain idle
our successful voyage had secured me
scores of friends among the spanish
slavers and  received daily applications
for a fresh command

  but the plans of my french friend had
so bewitched me with a desire for imita-
tion that i declined subordinate posts and
aspired to ownership accordingly i
proposed to the proprietor of a large
american clipper brig that we should fit
her on the same system as the san pablo
yet wishing to surpass my late captain in
commercial success i suggested the idea of
fighting for our cargo or in plainer lan-
guage of relieving another slaver of her
living freight a project which promptly

             sea-
adventures of an african slaver



found favor with the owner of la con-
chita the vessel in question originally
cost twelve thousand dollars and i pro-
posed to cover this value by expending an
equal sum on her outfit in order to con-
stitute me half owner

  the bargain was struck and the arma-
ment sails additional spars rigging and
provisions went on board with prudential
secrecy inasmuch as we could not leave
port without some show of a cargo mer-
chandise in bond was taken from the pub-
lic warehouses and after being loaded in
our hold during day was smuggled ashore
again at night as the maneuver was a
trick of my accomplice who privately
gained by the ojeration i took no notice
of what was delivered or taken away

  finally all was ready forty-five men
were shipped and the conchita cleared
next day at daybreak i was to sail with
the land breeze

  a sailors last night ashore is proverbial
and none of the customary ceremonies
were omitted on this occasion there was
a parting supper with plenty of cham-
pagne there was a visit to the cafe a fare-
well call here another there and a bumper
everywhere in fact till two in the morn-
ing i was busy with my adieus but
when i got home at last with my thump-
ing headache i was met at the door by
a noe from my partner stating that our
vessel was seized and an order issued for
my arrest he counseled me to keep aloof
from the alguazilcs till he could arrange the
matter with the custom house and police

  i will not enlarge this chapter of dis-
asters next day my accomplice was
lodged in prison for his fraud the vessel
confiscated her outfit sold and my purse
cropped to the extent of twelve thousand
dollars i had barely time to escape be-
fore the officers were in my lodgings and
i finally saved myself from a cuban prison
by taking another name and playing
rancher among the hills for several weeks

v	finances were at low-water mark
when i strolled one tine morning
into matanzas and after some delay
again obtained command of a slaver
through the secret influence of my old and
trusty friends the new craft was a dash-
ing schooner of one hundred and twenty
tons fresh from the united states and
intended forwhvdah on the slave coast

   sea-

tt was calculated that we might bring
home at least four hundred and fifty slaves
for whose purchase i was supplied plenti-
fully with rum powder english muskets
and rich cottons from manchester

  in due time we sailed for the cape
verdes the usual port of dispatch  such
excursions at praya we exchanged our
flag for the portuguese before we put up
our helm for the coast a british cruiser
chased up fruitlessly for two days off
sierra leone and enabled me not only to
test the sailing qualities but to get the
sailing trim of the estrella in perfection
so confident did i become of the speed
and bottom of my gallant clipper that i
ventured with a leading wind to chase
the first vessel i described on the horizon
and was altogether deceived by the tri-
color displayed at her peak indeed i
could not divine this novel nationality till
the speaking trumpet apprised s that the
lilies of france had taken triple hues in
the hands of louis philippe accordingly
before i squared away for whydah i
saluted the royal republican by lowering
my flag thrice

   consigned the estrella to one of the
most remarkable traders that ever ex-
panded the african traffic by his genius

  senor da souza-better known  the
coast and in the interior as cha-cha-was
said to be a native mulatto of rio janeiro
whence he emigrated to dahomey after de-
serting the army of his imperial master
i do not know how he reached africa but
it is probable the fugitive made part of
some slavers crew and fled from his ves-
sel as he had previously abandoned the
military service in brazil his parents
were poor indolent and careless so that
cha-cha grew up an illiterate headstrong
youth yet when he touched the soil of
africa a new life seemed infused into
his veins for a while his days are said
to have been full of misery and trouble
but the brazilian slave trade happened to
receive an extraordinary impetus about
that period so gradually the adventurous
refugee managed to profit by his skill in
dealing with the natives or by acting as
broker among his countrymen beginning
in the humblest way he stuck to trade
with the utmost tenacity till he ripened into
an opulent factor

  the tinge of native blood that dyed his
complexion perhaps qualified him pecul-
iarly for this enterprise he loved the


sea stories

customs of the people he spoke their
language with the fluency of a native he
won the favor of chief after chief he
strove to be considered a perfect african
among africans though among whites
lie still affected the graceful address and
manners of his country in this way little
by little cha-cha advanced in the regard
of all he dealt with and secured the com-
missioners of brazil and cuba while he
was regarded and protected as a prime
favorite by the warlike king of dahomey
indeed it is alleged that this noted sover-
eign formed a sort of devilish compact
with the portuguese factor and supplied
him with everything he desired during life
in consideration of inheriting his wealth
when dead

  but cha-cha was resolved while the
power of enjoyment was still vouchsafed
him that all the pleasures of human life
accessible to money should not be wanting
in whydah he built a large and com-
modious dwelling for his residence on a
beautiful spot near the site of an aban-
doned portuguese fort he filled his es-
tablishment with every luxury and com-
fort that could please the fancy or gratify
the iwxly wines food delicacies and
raiment were brought from paris london
and havana the finest women along the
coast were lured to his settlement bil-
liard tables and gambling halls spread
their wiles or afforded distraction for de-
tained navigators in fine he surrounded
himself with all that could corrupt virtue
gratify passion tempt avarice betray
weakness satisfy sensuality and complete
a picture of incarnate slavery in dahomey

  when he sallied forth his walk was
always accompanied by considerable cere-
mony an officer preceded him to clear
the path a fool or buffoon hopped beside
him a band of native musicians sounded
their discordant instruments and a couple
of singers screamed at the top of their
voices the most fulsome adulation of the
mulatto

  numbers of vessels were of course re-
quired to feed this african nabob with
doubloons and merchandise sometimes
commanders from cuba or brazil- would
be kept months in his perilous nest while
their craft cruised along the coast in ex-
pectation of human cargoes at such sea-
sons  expedient was left untried for the
entertainment and pillage of wealthy or
trusted idlers if cha-chas board and

wines made them drunkards it was no
fault of his if rouge et noir or monte
won their doubloons and freight at his
saloon he regretted but dared not inter-
fere with the amusements of his guests-
if the sirens of his harem betrayed a cargo
for their favor over cards a convenient
fire destroyed the frail warehouse after
its merchandise was secretly removed

  cha-cha was exceedingly desirous that i
should accept his hospitality as soon as
i read my invoice to him-for he could
not do it himself-he became almost ir-
resistible in his empressement yet i de-
clined the invitation with firm politeness
and took up my quarters on shore at the
residence of a native manfuca or broker
i was warned of his allurements before i
left matanzas and resolved to keep my-
self and property so clear of his clutches
that our contract would either be fulfilled
or remain within my control thus by
avoiding his table and the society of his
dissipated sons i maintained my business
relations with the slaver and secured his
personal respect so effectually that at the
end of two months four hundred and
eighty prime negroes were in the bowels
of la estrella

chapter xxxiii

hile i tarried at whydah an invita-
tion came from the king of daho-
mey soliciting the presence of cha-
cha and his guests at the yearly customs
or sacrifice of human beings whose blood
is shed not only to appease an irritated god
but to satiate the appetite of departed
kings i did not accompany the party that
was present at this dread fui festival cha-
cha dispatched several of the captains who
were awaiting cargoes under the charge of
his own interpreters and the royal man-
fucas and from one of these eyewitnesses
whose curiosity was painfully satiated i
received a faithful account of the spec-
tacle

  for three days our travelers passed
through a populous region fed with abun-
dant repasts prepared in the native villages
by cha-chas cooks and resting at night
in hammocks suspended among the trees
on the fourth day the party reached the
great capital of abomey to which the
king had come for the bloody festival from
his residence at cannah

my friends were comfortably lodged
adventures of an african slaver



for repose and next morning presented to
the sovereign he was a well-built negro
dressed in the petticoat trousers of a turk
with yellow morocco boots while a pro-
fusion of silk shawls encircled his shoul-
ders and waist and a lofty headpiece
with trailing plumes surmounted his
wool a vast bodyguard of female sol-
diers or amazons armed with lances and
muskets surrounded his majesty

  presently the manfucas and interpreters
crawling on their hands and knees to the
royal feet deposited cha-chas tribute and
the white mens offering the first con-
sisted of several piece of crepe silks and
taffeta with a large pitcher and basin of
silver while the latter was a trifling gift
of twenty muskets and one hundred pieces
of blue dungaree the present was grace-
fully accepted and the donors welcomed
to the sacrifice which was delayed on
account of the scarcity of victims though
orders had been given to storm a neighbor-
ing tribe to make up three hundred slaves
for the festival in the meanwhile a spa-
cious house furnished in european style
and altogether better than the ordinary
dwellings of africa was assigned to the
strangers liberty was also given them
to enter wherever they pleased and take
what they wished inasmuch as all his sub-
jects male and female were slaves whom
he placed at the white mens disposal

  the th of may was announced as the
beginning of the sacrificial rites which
were to last five days early in the morn-
ing two hundred females of the ama-
zonian guard naked to the waist but
richly ornamented with beads and rings
at every joint of their oiled and glisten-
ing limbs appeared in the area before the
kings palace armed with blunt cutlasses
very soon the sovereign made his appear-
ance when the band of warriors began
their maneuvers keeping pace with rude
skill to the native drum and flute

  a short distance from the palace within
sight of the square a fort or inclosure
about nine feet high had been built of
adobe and surrounded by a pile of tall
prickly briers within this barrier se-
cured to stakes stood fifty captives who
were to be immolated at the opening of
the festival when a drill of the amazons
and the royal review were over there was
for a considerable time perfect silence in
the ranks and throughout the vast multi-
tude of spectators presently at a signal

from the king one hundred of the women
departed at a run brandishing their weap-
ons and yelling their war cry till heedless
of the barricade they leaped the walls
lacerating their flesh in crossing the thorns
the delay was short fifty of these fe-
male demons with torn limbs and bleeding
faces quickly returned and offered their
howling victims to the king

  it was now the duty of this personage
to begin the sacrifice with his royal hand
calling the female whose daring had led
her foremost across the thorns he took
a glittering sword from her grasp and in
an instant the head of the first victim fell
to the dust the weapon was then re-
turned to the woman who handing it to
the white men desired them to unite in
the brutal deed the strangers however
not only refused but sick at heart aban-
doned the scene of butchery it lasted
they understood till- noon when the
amazons were dismissed to their barracks
reeking with rum and blood for five
days the strangers were doomed to hear the
yells of the storming amazons as they as-
sailed the fort for fresh victims on
the sixth the sacrifice was over-the divin-
ity was appeased and quiet reigned again
in the streets of abomey

  before the travelers departed his maj-
esty proposed to accord them a parting in-
terview he received the strangers with
ceremonious politeness and called their at-
tention to the throne or royal seat upon
which he had coiled his limbs the chair
is said to have been an heirloom of at least
twenty generations each of its legs rests
on the skull of some native king or tribal
chief

  such is their respect for the usages of
antiquity that every three years the jjeople
of dahomey are obliged to renew the
steadiness of the stool by the fresh skulls
of some noted princes

chapter xnxiv

have always regretted that i left
whydah on my homeward voyage
without interpreters to aid in the nec-
essary intercourse with our slaves there
was no one on board who understood a
word of their dialect many complaints
from the negroes that would have been
dismissed or satisfactorily adjusted had we
comprehended grievances were passed over
in silence or hushed with the lash indeed
the whip alone was the emblem of la es-


sea stories

trellas discipline and in the end it taught
me the saddest of lessons

  from the beginning there was mani-
fest discontent among the slaves i en-
deavored at first to please and accommo-
date them by a gracious manner but man-
ner alone is not appreciated by untamed
africans a few days after our departure
a slave leaped overboard in a fit of pas-
sion and another choked himself during
the night these two suicides in twenty-
four hours caused much uneasiness among
the officers and induced me to make every
preparation for a revolt

  we had been at sea about three weeks
without further disturbance and there was
so much merriment among the gangs that
were allowed to come on deck that my ap-
prehensions of danger began gradually to
wear away however one fair afternoon
a squall broke forth from an almost cloud-
less sky and as the boatswains whistle
piped all hands to take in sail a simultane-
ous rush was made by the confined slaves
at all the after gratings amid the con-
fusion of the rising gale they knocked
down the guard and poured upon deck
the sentry at the fore hatch seized the
cooks ax and sweeping it round him like
a scythe kept at bay the band that sought
to emerge from below him

  meantime the women in the cabin were
not idle seconding the males they rose
in a body and the helmsman was forced
to stab several with his knife before he
could drive them below again by this
time there were about forty stalwart devils
on deck yelling and grinning armed with
staves of broken water casks or billets of
wood found in the hold

  the blow that prostrated the first white
man was the earliest symptom i detected
of the revolt but in an instant i had the
arm chest open on the quarter deck and the
mate and steward beside me to protect it
matters did not stand so well forward
four of the hands were disabled by clubs
while the rest defended themselves and
the wounded as well as they could with
handspikes or whatever could suddenly be
clutched i had always charged the cook
on such an emergency to distribute from
his coppers a liberal supply of scalding
water upon the belligerents and at the
first sign of revolt he endeavored to bap-
tize the heathen with his steaming slush
but dinner had been over for some time
so that the lukewarm liquid only irritated

the savages one of whom laid the unfor-
tunate doctor bleeding in the scuppers

  all this occurred in perhaps less time
than i have taken to tell it yet rapid as
was the transaction i saw that between
the squall with its flying sails and the re-
volt with its raving blacks we would soon
be in a desperate plight unless i gave the
order to shoot accordingly i told my
comrades to aim low and fire at once

  our carbines had been puqxsely loaded
with buckshot to suit such an occasion so
that the first two discharges brought sev-
eral of the rebels to their knees still the
unharmed neither fled nor ceased brandish-
ing their weapons two more discharges
drove them forward amongst the mass of
my crew who had retreated toward the
bowsprit but being reenforced by the
boatswain and carpenter we took com-
mand of the hatches so effectually that a
dozen additional discharges among their
legs drove the refractory to their quar-
ters below

  it was time for sails ropes tacks
sheets and blocks were flapping dashing
and rolling about the masts and decks
threatening us with imminent danger from
the squall in a short time everything was
made snug the vessel put on our course
and attention paid to the mutineers who
had begun to fight among themselves in
the hold

  i perceived at once by the infuriated
sounds proceeding from below that we
could not descend through the hatches
accordingly we discharged the women
from their quarters under a guard on deck
and sent several resolute and well-armed
hands to remove a couple of boards from
the bulkhead that separated the cabin from
the hold when this was accomplished a
party entered on hands and knees and be-
gan to press the mutineers forward toward
the bulkhead of the forecastle the rebels
were hot for fight to the last and boldly
defended themselves with their staves

  by this time our lamed cook had rekin-
dled his fires and the water was once
more boiling the hatches were kept open
but guarded and all who did not fight
were suffered to come singly on deck where
they were tied as only about sixty re-
mained below engaged in conflict or defy-
ing my party of sappers and miners i
ordered a number of auger holes to be
bored in the deck as the scoundrels were
forced forward near the forecastle a
adventures of an african slaver



few buckets of boiling water rained on
them through the fresh apertures brought
the majority to submission

  two of the most savage held out against
water as well as fire i strove as long as
possible to save their lives but their re-
sistance was so prolonged and perilous
that we were obliged to disarm them for-
ever bv a couple of pistol shots

  so ended the revolt of la estrella in
which two of my men were seriously
wounded while twenty-eight balls and
buckshot were extracted from the slaves
one woman and three men perished of
blows received in the conflict but none
were deliberately slain except the two men
who resisted to death

  i could never account for this mutiny
especially as the blacks from whydah and
its neighborhood are distinguished for
their humble manners and docility there
can le no doubt that the entire gang was
not united in the original outbreak else
we should have had harder work in sub-
duing them amid the risk and turmoil of a
west indian squall

here was very little comfort on
board la estrella after the suppres-
sion of this revolt we lived with
a pent-up volcano beneath us and day and
night we were ceaselessly vigilant ter-
ror reigned supreme and the lash was its
scepter

  at last we made land at porto rico and
were swiftly passing its beautiful shores
when the inspector called my attention to
the appearance of one of our attendant
slaves whom we had drilled as a sort of
cabin boy he was a gentle intelligent
child and had won the hearts of all the
officers

  his pulse was high quick and hard
his face and eyes red and swollen on his
neck  detected half a dozen rosy pimples
he was sent immediately to the forecastle
free from contact with any one else and
left there cut off from the crew till i
could guard against pestilence it was
smallpox

  the boy passed a wretched night of
fever and pain developing the malady
with all its horrors it is very likely that
i slept as badly as the sufferer for my
mind was busy with his doom daylight
found me on deck in consultation with our
veteran boatswain whose experience in the
trade authorized the highest respect for his

opinion hardened as he was the old
mans voice was husky as he whispered the
verdict in my ear i guessed it before he
said a word as we went aft to the quar-
ter deck all eyes were bent upon us for
every one conjectured the malady and
feared the result yet none dared ask a
question

  i ordered a general inspection of the
slaves yet when a favorable rejxjrt was
made i did not rest content and descended
to examine each one personally it was
true the child was alone infected

  for half an hour i trod the deck to and
fro restlessly and caused the crew to sub-
ject themselves to inspection but my
sailors were as healthy as the slaves
there was no symptom that indicated ap-
proaching danger i was disappointed
again a single case-a single sign of
peril in any quarter-would have spared
the poison

  that evening in the stillness of night
a trembling hand stole forward to the af-
flicted boy with a potion that knows no
waking in a few hours all was over
life and the pestilence were crushed to-
gether

dam not superstitious but a voyage
attended with such calamities could
not end happily incessant gales and
head winds unusual in this season and
latitude beset us so obstinately that it be-
came doubtful whether our food and
water would last till we reached matanzas
to add to our risks and misfortunes a
british corvette espied our craft and gave
chase off cape may si

  all day long she dogged us slowly but
at night i tacked off shore with the ex-
pectation of eluding my pursuer day
dawn however revealed her again on our
track though this time we had unfortu-
nately fallen to leeward accordingly i
put la estrella directly before the wind
and ran till dark with afresli breeze when
i again dodged the cruiser and made for
the cuban coast but the briton seemed
to scent my track for sunrise revealed him
once more in chase

  the wind lulled that night to a light
breeze yet the red clouds and haze in the
east betokened a gale from that quarter be-
fore meridian a longer pursuit must
have given considerable advantage to the
enemy so that my best reliance i calcu-
lated was in making the small harbor


sea stories

near santiago now about twenty miles dis-
tant where i had already landed two
cargoes the corvette was then full ten
miles astern

  my resolution to save the cargo and
lose the vessel was promptly made or-
ders were issued to strike from the
slaves the irons they had constantly worn
since the mutiny the boats were made
ready and every man prepared his bag for
a rapid launch

  on dashed the cruiser foaming at the
bows under the impetus of the rising
gale which struck him some time before
it reached us we were not more than
seven miles apart when the first increased
pressure on our sails was felt and every-
thing was set and braced to give it the
earliest welcome then came the tug and
race for the beach lying three miles ahead
of us

  under such circumstances it was hardly
to be expected that st george would
carry the day still every nerve was
strained to effect his purpose regard-
less of the gale reef after reef was let
out force pumps moistened his sails yet
nothing was gained three miles against
seven were too much odds-and with a
slight move of the helm and letting all fly
as we neared the line of surf to break
her headway la estrella was fairly and
safely beached

  the sudden shock snapped her main-
mast like a pipestem but as no one was
injured in a twinkling the loats were
overboard crammed with women and chil-
dren while a stage was rigged from the
bows to the strand so that the males the
crew and the luggage were soon in charge
of my old planter

  prompt as we were we were not suf-
ficiently so for the cruiser half our
cargo was ashore when she backed her
topsails off the mouth of the little bay low-
ered her boats filled them with boarders
and steered toward our craft the delay
of half a miles row gave us time to cling
still longer to the wreck so that when the
boats and corvette began to fire we wished
them joy of their bargain over the rem-
nant of our least valuable negroes the
rescued blacks are now in all likelihood
citizens of jamaica

  under the influence of the gale la es-
trella made a very picturesque bonfire as
we saw it that night from the porch of
our landlords domicile

isastrous as was this enterprise
both on the sea and in the counting-
house a couple of months found me
on board a splendid clipper-born of the
famous waters of the chesapeake-delight-
ing in the name of aguila de oro or
golden eagle and spinning out of the
cape verdes on a race with a famous
west indian privateer

  the montesquieu was the pride of
jamaica for pluck and sailing when folks
of her character were not so unpopular
as of late among the british islands and
many a banter passed between her com-
mander and myself while i was unsuccess-
fully waiting till the governor resolved his
conscientious difficulties alout the exchange
of flags at last i offered a bet of five
hundred dollars against an equal sum and
next day a bag with the tempting thousand
was tied to the end of my main boom with
an invitation for the boaster to follow and
take it was understood that once clear
of the harbor the aguila should have five
minutes start of the montesquieu after
which we were to crowd sail and begin the
race

  the contest was quickly noised through-
out the port and the captains smacked their
lips over the dinner promised by the
boaster out of the five hundred dollars won
from the yankee nutshell accordingly
when all was ready and the breeze favored
the eastern cliffs of the isle were crowded
with spectators to witness the regatta

  as we were first at sea and clear of
the harbor we delayed for our antagonist
and without claiming the conceded start
of five minutes did not shoot ahead till
our rival was within musket shot but
then the tug began with a will and as
the aguila led i selected her most favor-
able trim and kept her two points free
the montesquieu did the same but con-
fident of her speed did not spread all her
canvas that would draw the error was
soon apparent our chesaipeake clipper
crawled off as if her opponent were at
anchor and in a jiffy everything that
could be carried was sheeted home and
braced to a hair the breeze was steady
and strong soon the island was cleared
entirely and by keeping away another point
i got out of the aguila her utmost capacity
as a racer as she led off the montes-
quieu followed-but glass by glass and
adventures of an african slaver



hour by hour the distance between us in-
creased til at sunset the boasters hull
was below the horizon and my bag taken
in as a lawful prize

  i did not return to praya after this ad-
venture but keeping on toward the coast
in four days entered the rio salum an
independent river between the french
island of goree and the british possessions
on the gambia no slaver had haunted
this stream for many a year so that i
was obliged to steer my mosquito pilot boat
full forty miles into the interior through
mangroves and forests till t struck the
trading ground of the king

  after three days parley i had just con-
cluded my bargain with his breechless
majesty when a barker greeted me with
the cheerless message that the aguila was
surrounded by man-of-war boats it was
true but the mate refused an inspection of
his craft on neutral ground and the naval
folks departed nevertheless a week-
after when i had just completed my traf-
fic i was seized by a gang of the treacher-
ous kings own people delivered to the
second lieutenant of a french corvette-
la bayoniiaise-and my lovely little eagle
caged as her lawful prey

  i have never been able to understand the
legal merits of this seizure so far as the
act of the french officers was concerned
as no treaty existed between france and
spain for the suppression of slavery the
reader will not be surprised to learn there-
fore that there was a very loud explosion
of wrath among my men when they
found themselves prisoners nor was
their fury diminished when our whole
band was forced into a dungeon at goree
which for size gloom and closeness vied
with the black hole of calcutta

  for three days were we kept in this
filthy receptacle in a burning climate with-
out communication with friends or inhabi-
tants and on scanty fare till it suited
the local authorities to transfer us to
st louis on the senegal in charge of a
file of marines on board our own vessel

  st louis is the residence of the gov-
ernor and the seat of the colonial tribunal
and here again we were incarcerated in
a military jail till several merchants who
knew me  the rio pongo interfered and
had us removed to better quarters in the
military hospital i soon learned that there
was trouble among the natives a war had
broken out among some of the moorish

tribes two hundred miles up the senegal
and my aguila was a godsend to the
frenchmen who needed just such a light
craft to guard their returning flotilla with
merchandise from gatam accordingly
the craft was armed manned and
dispatched on this expedition without
waiting the decree of a court as to the
lawfulness of her seizure

  meanwhile the sisters of charity-
those angels of devoted mercy who do not
shun even the heat and the pestilence of
africa-made our prison life as comfort-
able as possible and had we not seen grat-
ings at the windows or met a sentinel when
we attempted to go out we might have
considered ourselves valetudinarians in-
stead of convicts

  a month oozed slowly away in these
headquarters of suffering before a mili-
tary sergeant informed us that he had
been elevated to the dignity of the long
robe and appointed our counsel in the ap-
proaching trial no other lawyer was to
be had in the colony for love or money
and perhaps our military man might have
acquitted himself as well as the best had not
his superiors often imposed silence on
him during the argument

  by this time the nimble aguila had made
two most serviceable trips under the
french officers and proved so valuable to
the government that no one dreamed of
recovering her the colonial authorities
had two alternatives under the circum-
stances-either to pay for or condemn her
-and as they knew i would not be will-
ing to take the craft again after the de-
struction of my voyage the formality of
a trial was determined to legalize the con-
demnation it was necessary however
even in africa to show that i had vio-
lated the territory of the french colony by
trading in slaves and that the aguila had
been caught in the act

  i will not attempt a description of the
court scene in which my military friend
was browbeaten by the prosecutor the
prosecutor by the judge and the judge
by myself after various outrages and
absurdities a moslem slave was allowed to
be sworn as a witness against me where-
upon i burst forth with a torrent of argu-
ment defense abuse and scorn till a
couple of soldiers were called to keep my
limbs and tongue in forensic order

  but the deed was done the foregone
conclusion was formally announced the


sea stories

aguila de oro became king louis
philippes property while my men were
condemned to two my officers to five and
don theodore himself to ten years con-
finement in the central prisons of france

  my sentence aroused the indignation of
many respectable merchants at st louis
and of course  did not lack kindly visits
in the stronghold to which i was recon-
ducted it was found to be entirely use-
less to attack the sympathy of the tri-
bunal to procure either a rehearing of the
cause or mitigation of the judgment
presently a generous friend introduced a
saw suitable to discuss the toughness of
iron bars and hinted that on the night
when my window gratings were severed
a boat might be found waiting to transport
me to the opposite shore of the river
whence an independent chief would con-
vey me on camels to gambia

  i know not how it was that the govern-
ment got wind of my projected flight but
it certainly did and we were sent on
board a station ship lying in the stream
still my friends did not abandon me i
was apprised that a party-bound on a
shooting frolic down the river on the first
foggy morning-would visit the com-
mander of the hulk and while the vessel
was surrounded by a crowd of boats i
might slip overboard amid the confusion
under cover of the dense mist that shrouds
the surface of an african river at dawn i
could easily elude even a ball if sent after
me and when i reached the shore a canoe
would be ready to convey me to a friendly
ship

  the scheme was peculiarly feasible as
the captain happened to be a good fellow
and allowed me unlimited liberty about his
vessel accordingly when the note had
been duly digested i called my officers
apart and proposed their participation in
my escape the project was fully dis-
cussed by the fellows but the risk of
swimming even in a fog under the muz-
zles of muskets was a danger they feared
encountering i perceived at once that it
would be best to free myself entirely from
the encumbrances of such chicken-hearted
lubbers so i bade them take their own
course but divided three thousand francs
in government bills among the gang and
presented my gold pocket chronometer to
the mate

  next morning an impervious fog laid
low on the bosom of the senegal but
through its heavy folds i detected the

measured beat of approaching oars till five
boats with a sudden rush dashed alongside
us with their noisy and clamorous crews

  just at this very moment a friendly
hand passed through my arm and a gentle
tone invited me to a quarter-deck prome-
nade it was our captain

  there was of course no possibility of
declining the proffered civility for during
the whole of my detention on board the
commander had treated me with the most
assiduous politeness

  my dear canot said he as soon as
we got aft you seem to take considerable
interest in these visitors of ours and 
wish from the lottom of my heart that
you could join the sport but unfortu-
nately for you these gentlemen will not
effect itheir purpose

  as i did not entirely comprehend-
though i rather guessed-his precise
meaning i made an evasive answer and
arm in arm i was led from the deck to the
cabin when we were perfectly alone lie
pointed to a seat and frankly declared that
 had been betrayed by a judas to his ser-
geant of marines

  i was taken perfectly aback as i imag-
ined myself almost free yet the loss of
liberty did not paralyze me as much as
the perfidy of my men like a stupid
booby i stood gazing with a fixed stare
at the captain when the cabin door burst
open and with a shout of joyous merri-
ment the hunters greeted their comrade

  my dress that morning was a very
elaborate negligee i had purposely
omitted coat braces stockings and shoes
so that my privateer costume of trousers
and shirt was not calculated for the re-
ception of strangers it was natural
therefore that the first sally of my friendly
liberators should be directed against my
toilet  parried it however as adroitly
as my temper would allow by reproaching
them with their unseasonable visit before
i could complete the bath which they saw
i was prepared for

  the hint was understood but the cap-
tain thought proper to tell the entire talc
no man he said would have been hap-
pier than lie had i escaped before the
treachery my friends were entreated not
to risk further attempts which might sub-
ject me to severe restraints and my base
comrades were forthwith summoned to the
cabin where in presence of the merchants
they were forced to disgorge the three
thousand francs and the chronometer
adventures of an african slaver



  but this said the captain is not
to be the end of the comedy as he led
the way to the mess room where a sump-
tuous dinner was spread for officers and
huntsman and over its fragrant fumes
my disappointment was for a while for-
gotten

chapter xxxvi

or fifteen days more the angry cap-
tive bit his thumbs on the taffrail of
the guard ship and gazed either at
vacancy or the waters of the senegal at
the end of that period a gunboat trans-
ferred our convict party to the frigate
flora whose first lieutenant to whom 
had been privately recommended separ-
ated me immediately from my men the
scoundrels were kept close prisoners dur-
ing the whole voyage to france while my
lot was made as light as possible under
the severe sentence awarded to me at
st louis

  the passage was short at brest they
landed me privately while my men and
officers were paraded through the streets
at midday under a file of gendarmes i
am especially grateful to the commander
of this frigate who alleviated my suffer-
ings by his generous demeanor in every
respect and whose representations to the
government of france caused my sentence
to be subsequently modified to simple im-
prisonment

  when the polite midshipman with whom
i landed bade farewell it was only to
transfer me to the keeper of a prison
within the royal arsenal here i was soon
joined by the crew and officers for a
while i rejected their penitence but a
man who is suddenly swept from the wild
liberty of africa and doomed for ten years
to penitential seclusion becomes wonder-
fully forgiving when ioneliness eats into
his- neart and eternal silence makes the
sound of his own voice almost insupport-
able one therefore was restored at least
to sociability so that when  embraced the
permission of our keeper to quit my cell
and move about the prison bounds i found
myself surrounded by seventy or eighty
marines and seamen who were undergoing
the penalties of various crimes

  the whole establishment was under the
surveillance of a naval commissary sub-
ject to strict regulations in due time two
spacious rooms were assigned for my

gang while the jailer who turned out to
be an amphibious scamp half sailor half
soldier assured us on the honor of an old
soldier that his entire jurisdiction should
be our limits so long as we behaved with
propriety

  next day i descended to take exercise
in a broad courtyard over whose lofty
walls the fresh blue sky looked temptingly
and was diligently chewing the cud of
bitter fancies when a stout elderly man in
shabby uniform came to a military halt
before me and abruptly saluting in regu-
lation style desired the favor of a word

  pardon me sir said the intruder but
i should be charmed if the captain will
honor me by the information whether it
has been his lot to enjoy the accommoda-
tions of a french prison prior to the un-
lucky mischance which gives us the delight
of his society

  no said i sulkily

  then continued the questioner will
it be disagreeable if i improve this oppor-
tunity by apprising the captain on the part
of our companions and comrades of the
regulations of this royal institution 

  by no means i returned somewhat
softer

  then sir the sooner you are initiated
into the mysteries of the craft the belter
and no one will go through the ceremony
more explicitly briefly and satisfactorily
than myself-corporal blon first of all
sir and most indispensable as your good
sense will teach you it is necessary that
every newcomer pay his footing among the
government boarders and as you seem to
be the honored chief of the squadron i
will make bold to thank you for a louis
dor or a napoleon to insure your wel-
come

  the request was complied with

  good continued the corporal now
i have but one more mystery to impart
and that is a regulation which no clever
chap disregards we are companions in
misery we sleep beneath one roof we eat
out of one kettle-in fact we arc brothers
and the secrets of brothers are sacred
within these walls from jailers and turn-
keys

  as he said these words he pursed up his
mouth bent his eves scrutinizingly into
mine and laying his finger on his lip
brought his right hand once more with a
salute to the oily remnant of a military
cap


sea stories

  i was initiated i gave the required
pledge for my party and in return was
assured that in any enterprise undertaken
for our escape-which seemed to be the
great object and concern of prison life-we
should be assisted and protected by our
fellow sufferers

  most of this day was passed in our
rooms and at dark after being mustered
and counted we were locked up for the
night for some time we moped and
sulked according to the fashion of all new
convicts but at length we sallied forth in
a body to the courtyard determined to
take the world as it went

  i soon fell into a habit of chatting famil-
iarly with old corporal blon who was
grand chamberlain or master of ceremonies
to our penal household and turned out to
be a good fellow though a frequent of-
fender against france blon drew me to
a seat in the sunshine which  enjoyed
after shivering in the cold apartments of
the prison and stepping off among the
prisoners began to bring them up for in-
troduction to don theodore separately

  first of all i had the honor of receiving
monsieur laramie a stout stanch well-
built marine who professed to be master-
at-arms of our royal boarding house and
tendered his services in teaching me the use
of rapier and broadsword at the rate of
a franc per week next came a burly
beef-eating bully half sailor half lubber
who approached with a swinging gait and
was presented as brother zouche teacher
of singlestick who was willing to make me
skillful in my encounters with footpads
for a reasonable salary then followed a
dancing master a tailor a violin teacher
a shoemaker a letter writer a barber a
clothes washer and various other useful
and reputable tradespeople or professors
all of whom expressed anxiety to inform
my mind cultivate my taste expedite my
correspondence delight my ear and im-
prove my appearance for weekly stipends

  i did not at first understand precisely
the object of all their ceremonious appeals
to my purse but i soon discovered from
corporal blon-who desired an early dis-
count of his note-that i was looked on as
a sort of potentate from africa who had
saved an immense quantity of gold from
ancient traffic all of which i could com-
mand in spite of imprisonment

  i thought it best not to undeceive the
industrious wretches and dismissed each of
them with a few kind words promising to

accept their offers when i became a little
more familiar with my quarters

  after breakfast i made a tour of the
corridors to see whether the representa-
tions of my morning courtiers were true
and found the shoemakers and tailors busy
over toeless boots and patchwork garments
one alcove contained the violinist and
dancing master giving lessons to several
scapegraces in another was the letter
writer laboriously adorning a sheet with
cupids hearts flames and arrows while a
lovelorn booby knelt beside him dictating
a message to his mistress in a hall i
found two pupils of monsieur laramie at
carte and tierce in the corridors i came
upon a string of tables filled with cigars
snuff writing paper ink pens wax wa-
fers needles and thread while in the re-
motest cell i di-scovered a pawnbroker
and gambling table

hery soon after my incarceration at
brest i addressed a memorial to the
- spanish consul setting forth the af-
flictions of twenty-two of his masters sub-
jects and soliciting the interference of our
ambassador at paris we were promptly
visited by the consul and an eminent law-
yer who asserted his ability to stay pro-
ceedings against the ratification of our sen-
tence but as the spanish minister never
thought fit to notice our misfortunes the
efforts of the lawyer and the good will of
our consul were ineffectual

  three months glided by blon kept me
busy discounting his twenty-sou notes
which  afterward always took care to lose
to him at cards then i patronized the
dancing master took two months lessons
with laramie and zouche caused my shoes
to be thoroughly mended had my clothes
repaired and scoured and finally patron-
ized all the various industries of my com-
rades to the extent of almost two hundred
francs

  suddenly in the midst of these diversions
an order came for our immediate transfer
to the civil prison of brest a gloomy
tower in the walled chateau

chapter xxxvii

     was taken from one prison to the
     other in a boat and once more spared

- the mortification of a parade through

the streets under a guard of soldiers

  a receipt was given for the whole squad
to the keeper who chaperoned us my
men were summarily distributed by the
adventures of an african slaver



jailer among the cells already filled with
common malefactors but as the appear-
ance of the officers indicated the possession
of cash the turnkey offered a special cell
for our use provided we were satisfied
with a monthly rent of ten francs i
thought the french government was bound
to find suitable acommodations for an in-
voluntary guest and that it was rather hard
to imprison me first and make me pay
board afterward but i concluded on re-
flection to accept the offer hard as it was
accordingly we took possession of a large
apartment with two grated windows look-
ing upon a somber courtyard

  we had hardly entered the room when
a buxom woman followed with the deep-
est curtsies and declared herself most happy
to have it in her power to supply us with
beds and beddings at ten sous per day
she told us moreover that the daily
prison fare consisted of two pounds and
a half of black bread with water but if
we wished she might introduce the cook
of the regiment stationed in the chateau
who would supply our meals twice a day
from the mess of the petty officers of the
regiment

  my money had not been seriously moth-
eaten during our previous confinement so
that i did not hesitate to strike a bargain
with madame sorret and to request that
the cook might make her appearance as
soon as possible presently the door
opened again and the dame reappeared
accompanied by two spanish women
wives of musicians in the corps who had
heard that several of their countrymen
had that morning been incarcerated and
availed themselves of the earliest chance
to visit them

  i at once proceeded to arrange the diet
of our future prison life we were to
have two meals a day of three dishes for
each of which we were to pay fifteen sous
in advance the bargain made we sat
down on the floor for a chat

  my brace of catalan visitors had mar-
ried in this regiment when the duke
dangouleme marched his troops into
spain and like faithful girls followed
iheir husbands in all their meanderings
about france since the regiments return
as two of my officers were catalonians
by birth a friendship sprang up between
us and from that hour these excellent
women not only visited us daily but ran our
errands attended to our health watched

us like sisters and procured all those little
comforts which the tender soul of the sex
can alone devise

     ivil prisoners in the provinces of
france were treated barbarously
the regular ration as i said before
consisted exclusively of black bread and
water nine pounds of straw were al-
lowed weekly to each prisoner for his lair
neither blankets nor covering were fur-
nished even in the winter as the cells
are built without stoves or chimneys the
wretched convicts were compelled to hud-
dle together in heaps to keep from perish-
ing besides this the government denied
all supplies of fresh raiment so that the
wretches who were destitute of friends or
means were alive and hideous with vermin
in a few days after incarceration no
amusement was allowed in the fresh air
save twice a week when the prisoners
were turned out on the flat roof of the
tower here they might sun themselves
for an hour or two under the muzzle of
a guard

  i believe that convicts in the central
prisons of france where they were cither
made or allowed to work fared better in
every respect than in the provincial lock-
ups on the coast there is no doubt how-
ever that the above description was en-
tirely true in those days of all the smaller
jurisdictions whose culprits were simply
doomed to confinement without labor

  often my heart bled for the poor sailors
whom t aided to the extent of prudence
from my slender means when t knew
not how long it might be my fate to re-
main an inmate of the chateau after
these unfortunate men disposed of all their
spare garments to obtain now and then a
meager soup to moisten their stony loaves
they were nearly a year without tasting
either meat or broth once only-on the
anniversary of st philippe-the sisters of
charity gave them a pair of bullocks heads
to make a festival in honor of the good
king of the french

m

y	officers and i fared somewhat better
in our hired apartment our span-
ish girls supplied us with guitars and
violins which my comrades touched with
some skill we were thus enabled to give
an occasional dance assisted by the cook
her companions dolorescita concha mad-
ame sorret and an old maid who passed


sea stories

for lier sister the arrival of a genial
counterfeiter enabled us to make up a full
cotillion without the musicians

  our dances enlivened by private con-
tributions and a bottle or two of wine
took place on thursdays and sundays
the rest of the week was passed in play-
ing cards reading romances writing peti-
tions flirting with the girls and cursing
our fate and the french government fits
of wrath against the majesty of gaul
were more frequent in the early morning
when the pleasant sleeper would be sud-
denly roused from his dreams by the tramp
of soldiers and grating bolts which an-
nounced the unceremonious entrance of
our inspector to count his cattle and
sound our window gratings

  but time wastes ones cash as well as
ones patience in prison the more we
grumbled danced drank and ate the
more we spent or lavished so that my
funds looked very like a thin sediment at
ihe bottom of the purse i began to re-
flect upon means of replenishing them i
could not beg i was master of no handi-
craft nor was t willing to descend among
the vermin of the common chain gang
shame prevented an application to my rel-
atives in france or italy and when i ad-
dressed my old partner or former friends
in cuba i was not even favored with a
reply at last my little trinkets and gold
chronometer were sacrificed to pay the law-
yer for a final memorial and to liquidate a
weeks lodging in advance

  now sir said madame sorret as
she took my money-trimming her cap and
looking at me with that thrifty interest
which a frenchwoman always knows how
to turn to the best account-this is your
last franc and your last week in my apart-
ment you say-your last week in a room
where you and i and babette dolorescita
and concha and monsieurs have had such
good times but why my dear why shall
it be your last week come let us think a
bit wont it be a thousand times better
wont it do you a vast deal more good-
if instead of cursing louis philippe pay-
ing lawyers for memorials that are never
read hoping for letters from the spanish
envoy which never come and eating your
heart up in spite and bitterness-you look
the matter plump in the face like a man
and not like a chicken and turn to account
those talents which it has pleased nature to
give you

  look you don theodore-you speak
foreign languages like a native and it
was no longer than yesterday that mon-
sieur randanne your advocate as he
came down from the last interview with
you stopped at my bureau and said ah
madame sorret what a linguist poor
canot is how delightfully he speaks
english and how glad i should be if he
had any place in which he could teach my
sons the noble tongue of the great
skatspeer

  now my captain she continued
what the good randanne said has been
growing in my mind ever since like the
salad seed in the box that is sunned in
our prison yard in fact i have fixed
the matter perfectly you shall have my
bedroom for a schoolliouse and if you
will you may begin to-morrow with my
two sons for pupils at fifteen francs a
month

  madame sorrets plan was perfectly
successful in less than a w-eck i was in-
stalled in her chamber with a class formed
of my ladys lads a son and friend of
my lawyer and a couple of sons of officers
in the chateau the whole producing a
monthly income of fifty francs as i as-
sumed my vocation with the spirit of a
needy professor i gained the good will of
all the parents by assiduous instruction of
their children gradually i extended the
sphere of my usefulness by adding pen-
manship to my other branches of tuition
and so well did i please the parents that
they volunteered a stipend of eighteen
francs more

  in this fashion the months passed with-
out too much pain my pardon came at
last but this was the sole reparation i re-
ceived at the hands of louis philippe for
the unjust seizure of my vessel in the
neutral waters of africa when sorret
rushed in followed by his wife babette
and the children to announce the glorious
news the good fellows emotion was so
great that he stood staring at me like
a booby and for a long while could not
articulate then came the cook dolores
and my pretty concha next arrived
mosieur randanne with the rest of my
pupils so that in an hour i was over-
whelmed with sunshine and tears i can
still feel the grasp of sorrets hand as he
led me beyond the bolts and bars to read
the act of royal grace

  next day an affectionate crowd of
adventures of an african slaver



friends and pupils followed the emanci-
pated slaver to a vessel which by order
of the king was to bear me a willing exile
from france forever

 chapter xxxviii

ad my seizure and sentence been
justly inflicted i might perhaps
have become penitent for early sins
during the long hours of reflection afforded
me in the chateau but with all the fervor
of an ardent and thwarted nature i was
much more disposed to rebel and revenge
myself when opportunity occurred than to
confess my sins with a lowly and obedient
heart indeed most of my time in prison
had been spent in cursing the court and
king or in reflecting how i should get back
to africa in the speediest manner

  the vessel that bore me into perpetual
banishment from france was bound to
lisbon but delaying in portugal only
long enough to procure a new passport
under an assumed name i spat upon louis
philippes eternal exile and took shipping
for his loyal port of marseilles here i
found two vessels fitting for the coast of
africa but in consequence of the fright-
ful prevalence of cholera all mercantile
adventures were temporarily suspended
in fact such was the panic that no one
dreamed of dispatching the vessel in which
i was promised a passage until the pesti-
lence subsided till this occurred as my
means were of the scantiest character 
took lodgings in an humble hotel

  the cholera was then apparently at its
height nearly all the hotels were de-
serted for most of the regular inhabitants
had fled and the city was unfrequented by
strangers except under pressing duty it
is altogether probable that the lodging-
houses and hotels would have been closed
entirely so slight was their patronage had
not the prefect issued an order depriving
of their licenses for the space of two
years all who shut their doors on strangers
accordingly even when the scourge swept
many hundred victims daily to their
graves every hotel cafe grocery butcher
shop and bakery was regularly opened in
marseilles so that a dread of famine was
not added to the fear of cholera

  of course the lowly establishment where
i dwelt was not thronged at this epoch
most of its inmates or frequenters had
departed for the country before my ar-

rival and i found the house tenanted only
by three boarders and a surly landlord who
cursed the authorities my reception was
by no means cordial i was told that the
proclamation had not prevented the cook
from departing and that i must be content
with whatever the master of the house
could toss up for my fare

  the table was a long oval board three
fourths bare of cloth and guests while five
human faces clustered around its end i
took my seat opposite a trim dashing bru-
nette with the brightest eyes and rosiest
cheeks imaginable her face was so
healthily refreshing in the midst of malady
and death that i altogether forgot the
cholera next me sat a comical sort of
fellow who did not delay in scraping an
acquaintance and insisted on introducing
all the company

  its a case of emergency said the
droll we have no time to lose or to
stand on the ceremony of fashionable eti-
quette here to-day gone to-morrow is
the motto of marseilles well sirs shall
we not make the most of new acquaintances
when they may be so brief

  i thanked him for his hospitality i had
so little to lose in this world either of
property or friends that i feared the chol-
era quite as slightly as any of the com-
pany a thousand thanks said i mon-
sieur for your politeness ill bury you
to-morrow if it is the choleras pleasure
with ten times more pleasure now that i
have had the honor of an introduction a
fashionable man hardly cares to be civil to
a stranger even if he happens to be a
corpse

  there was so hearty a cheer at this
sally that in spite of the shallow sound-
ings of my purse i called for a fresh
bottle and pledged the party in a bumper
all round

  and now continued my neighor as
it may be necessary for some one of us
to write your epitaph in a day or two
or at least to send a message of con-
dolence and sympathy to your friends
pray let us know a bit of your history and
what the devil brings you to marseilles
when the cholera thermometer is up to
one thousand degrees per diem

  very few words were necessary to im-
part such a name and tale as i chose to
invent for the companys edification
santiago ximenes and my tawny skin
betokened my nationality and profession


sea stories

while my threadbare garments spoke
louder than words that i was at suit with
fortune

  presently after a lull in the chat a dap-
per little prig of a dandy who sat on my
left volunteered to inform me that he was
no less a personage than dr du jean a
medical practitioner fresh from metropoli-
tan hospitals who in a spirit of the lofti-
est philanthropy visited this provincial
town at his own expense to succor the
poor

  she is a good lady our friend is she
not said he pointing to our patron saint
opposite

  i admitted without argument that she
was the most charming woman i ever saw
out of cuba

  she is my dear friend he whispered
confidentially strongly emphasizing the
word friend and nodding very know-
ingly toward the lady herself at the
present moment the dear creature is ex-
clusively under my charge and protection
for she is en route to join her husband a
captain in the army at algiers but heaven
be thanked theres no chance of a trans-
port so long as this cursed pestilence block-
ades marseilles

  do you know the man on your right
no thats the celebrated oratorical ad-
vocate about whom the papers rang when
louis philippe began his assault on the
press he too is on his way to algiers
and will be more successful in liberalizing
the arabs than the french

  that old chap over yonder with the
snuffy nose the snuffy wig and snuffy
coat is a grand speculator in horses 
his way to the richest cavalry corps of
the army and as for our innkeeper at
the head of this segment poor devil the
pestilence has nearly used him up he sits
half the day in his bureau on the stains
looking for guests who never come read-
ing the record which adds no name curs-
ing the cholera counting a penitential
prayer on his rosary and flying from the
despair of  silence and desertion to his
pans to stew our wretched fare

     it this table i ate till in the first lull
j of the pestilence the french mer-
chantman was dispatched from mar-
seilles twenty-seven days later i had the
pleasure to shake hands with the generous
friends who two years before labored so
hard for my escape however the colo-

nial government soon got wind of my
presence nothwithstanding my disguise
and warned me from goree

  i reached sierra leone in time to wit-
ness the arbitrary proceeding of the brit-
ish government toward spanish traders
and coasters by virtue of the new treaty
for the suppression of the slave trade
not till six months after this compact was
signed and ratified in london and madrid
was it made known in cuba and porto
rico its stipulations were such as to
allow very considerable latitude of judg-
ment in captures and when prizes were
once within the grasp of the british lion
that amiable animal was neither prompt to
release nor anxious to acquit accordingly
when i reached sierra leone i beheld at
anchor under government guns some
thirty or forty seized vessels-several of
which i have reason to believe were cap-
tured in the passage from havana to
spain and were entirely free from the
taint or design of slavery

chapter xxxix

was not so inquisitive or patriotic
in regard to treaty rights and viola-
tions as to dally from mere curiosity
in sierra leone my chief object was em-
ployment at twenty-eight after trials
hazards and chances enough to have won
half a dozen fortunes i was utterly penni-
less the mongo of kambia-the mo-
hammedan convert of ahmah-de-bellah-
the pet of the ali mami of futa jallon-
the leader of slave caravans-the owner of
barracoons-the master of clippers that de-
fied the british flag was reduced to the
humble situation of coast pilot and inter-
preter on board an american brig bound to
the celebrated slave mart of gallinas

  we reached our destination safely but i
doubt exceedingly whether the reapers
captain knows to this day that his brig
was guided by an adventurer who knew
nothing of the coast or port save the little
he gleaned in half a dozen chats with a
spanish pilot

  in the history of african servitude no
theater of spanish portuguese british or
american action has been the scene of
more touching tragic and profitable in-
cidents than the one to which fortune had
now directed my feet

  formerly the whole coast from the gam-
bia to cape palmas without a break save
at sierra leone was the haunt of daring
adventures of an african slaver



slavers the first impression on this law-
less disposal of full fifteen hundred miles
of beach and continent was made by the
establishment of liberia little by little
the power of this colony has extended
until treaty purchase negotiation and in-
fluence has driven the trade from the en-
tire region at the time of which i am
writing the slave trade on the windward
coast north and west of cape palmas
was mainly confined to portuguese settle-
ments-at bissaos on the rios grande
nunez and pongo at grand and little
bassa new sestros and trade town-
but the heart of the slave marts was the
lordly establishment gallinas to this
cape mesurado was only second in im-
portance

  our concern is now with gallinas
nearly one hundred miles northwest of
monrovia a short and sluggish river oozes
lazily into the atlantic and carrying down
in the rainy season a rich alluvion from
the interior sinks the deposit where the
tide meets the atlantic forming an in-
numerable mesh of spongy islands to one
who approaches from the sea they loom
up from its surface covered with reeds
and mangroves like an immense field of
fungi a spot like this possessed of
course no peculiar advantage for agricul-
ture or commerce but its dangerous bar
and its extreme desolation fitted it for
the haunt of the outlaw and slaver

  such in all likelihood were the rea-
sons that induced don pedro blanco a
well-educated mariner from malaga to
select gallinas as the field of his opera-
tions don pedro visited this place orig-
inally in command of a slaver but failing
to complete his cargo sent his vessel back
with one hundred negroes whose value was
barely sufficient to pay the mates and crew
blanco however remained on the coast
with a portion of the conquistadors cargo
and on its basis began a trade with the
natives and slaver captains till four years
after he remitted his owners the product
of their merchandise and began to flour-
ish on his own account the honest re-
turn of an investment long given over as
lost was perhaps the most active stimulant
of his success and for many years he
monopolized the traffic of the vey country
reaping enormous profits from his enter-
prise

  gallinas was not in its prime when i
came thither yet enough of its power and

influence remained to show the compre-
hensive mind of pedro blanco as i en-
tered the river and wound along through
the labyrinth of islands i was struck first
of all with the vigilance that made this
spaniard stud the field with lookout seats
protected from sun and rain erected some
seventy-five or hundred feet above the
ground either  poles or on isolated
trees from which the horizon was con-
stantly swept by telescopes to announce the
approach of cruisers or slavers these
telegraphic operators were the keenest men
on the islands and were never at fault in
discriminating between friend and foe

  about a mile from the rivers mouth we
found a group of islets on each of which
was erected the factory of some particular
slave merchant belonging to the grand con-
federacy blancos establishments were 
several of these marshy flats on one
near the mouth he had his place of busi-
ness or trade with foreign vessels presided
over by his principal clerk an astute and
clever gentleman on another island
more remote was his residence where the
only white person was a sister who for a
while shared with don pedro his solitary
and penitential domain

  here this man of education and refined
address surrounded himself with every lux-
ury that could be purchased in europe or
the indies and dwelt in a sort of oriental
but semibarbarous splendor that suited an
african prince rather than a spanish
grandee farther inland was another islet
devoted to his seraglio within whose re-
cesses each of his favorites inhabited her
separate establishment

  independent of all these were other
islands devoted to the barracoons or
slave prisons ten or twelve of which con-
tained from one hundred to five hundred
slaves in each these barracoons were
made of rough staves or poles of the hard-
est trees four or six inches in diameter
driven five feet in the ground and clamped
together by double rows of iron bars
their roofs were constructed of similar
wood strongly secured and overlaid with
a thick thatch of long and wiry grass
rendering the interior both dry and cool
at the ends watchhouses-built near the
entrance-were tenanted by sentinels with
loaded muskets each barracoon was
tended by two or four spaniards or por-
tuguese upon whom fever and dropsy
seemed to have emptied their vials


sea stories

  such were the surroundings of don
pedro in  when i first saw his slender
figure swarthy face and received the
graceful welcome which i hardly expected
from one who had passed fifteen years
without crossing the bar of gallinas
three years after this interview he left the
coast forever with a fortune of near a
million for a while lie dwelt in havana
engaged in commerce but i understood
that family difficulties induced him to re-
tire altogether from trade so that if still
alive lie is probably a resident of genoa
whither he went from the tropical island
of cuba

  the power of this man among the na-
tives is well known it far exceeded that
of cha-cha of whom  have already
spoken resolved as he was to be success-
ful in traffic he left no means untried with
blacks as well as whites to secure pros-
perity i have often been asked what was
the character of a mind which could vol-
untarily isolate itself for near a lifetime
amid the pestilential swamps of a burning
climate trafficking in human flesh exciting
wars bribing and corrupting ignorant
negroes i have always replied to the
question that this african enigma puzzled
me as much as it did those orderly and
systematic persons who would naturally be
more shocked at the tastes and prolonged
career of a resident slave factor in the
marshes of gallinas

  i heard many tales on the coast of
blancos cruelty but i doubt them quite
as much as  do the stories of his pride
and arrogance i have heard it said that
he shot a sailor for daring to ask him for
permission to light his cigar at the fire of
the don upon another occasion it is said
that he was traveling on the beach some dis-
tance from gallinas near the island of
sherboro where lie was unknown when he
approached a native hut for rest and re-
freshment the owner was squatted at
the door and on being requested by don
pedro to hand him fire to light his cigar
deliberately refused in an instant blanco
drew back seized a carbine from one of
his attendants and slew the negro on the
spot it is true that the narrator apolo-
gized for don pedro by saying that to
deny a castilian fire for his tobacco was
the gravest insult that can be oflered him
yet from my knowledge of the person in
question i cannot believe that he carried
etiquette to so frightful a pitch even

among a class whose lives are considered
of trifling value except in market on
several occasions during our subsequent
intimacy i knew him to chastise with
rods even to the brink of death servants
who ventured to infringe the sacred limits
of his seraglio but on the other hand
his generosity was proverbial not only
among the natives whom it was his interest
to suborn but to the whites who were in
his employ or needed his kindly succor

  i have already alluded to his mental
culture which was decidedly high for a
spaniard of his original grade and time
his memory was remarkable  remember
one night when several of his employees
were striving unsuccessfully to repeat the
lords prayer in latin upon which they
had made a bet that don pedro joined the
party and taking up the wager went
through the petition without faltering
when it was won the slaver insisted on
receiving the slave which was the stake
and immediately bestowed him in charity
on a captain who had fallen into the
clutches of a british cruiser

  such is a rude sketch of the great man
merchant of africa the rothschild of
slavery whose bills on england france
or the united states were as good as
gold in sierra leone and monrovia

he day after our arrival within the
realm of this great spider-who
thronged in the center of his mesh
was able to catch almost every fly that flew
athwart the web-i landed at one of the
minor factories and sold a thousand quar-
ter kegs of powder to don jose ramon
but next day when i proceeded in my
capacity of interpreter to the establish-
ment of don pedro i found his castilian
plumage ruffled  and though we were re-
ceived with formal politeness he declined
to purchase because we had failed to ad-
dress him in advance of any other factor
on the river

  the folks at sierra leone dwelt so
tenderly on the generous side of blancos
character that i was still not without hope
that i might induce him to purchase a
good deal of our rum and tobacco which
would -be drugs on our hands unless he
consented to relieve us i did not think it
altogether wrong therefore to concoct
a little ruse whereby i hoped to touch the
pocket through the breast of the don

             sea-
adventures of an african slaver



  i addressed him a note in which  truly
related my recent mishaps adventures and
imprisonments but i concluded the nar-
rative with a hope that he would succor
one so destitute and unhappy by allowing
him to win an honest commission allowed
by the american captain on any sales i
could effect the bait took a prompt
laconic answer returned i was bidden to
come ashore with the invoice of our cargo
and for my sake don pedro purchased
from the yankee brig five thousand dollars
worth of rum and tobacco all of which
was paid by drafts on london of which
slaves were of course the original basis
my imaginary commissions however re-
mained in the purse of the owners

  an accident occurred in landing our
merchandise which will serve to illustrate
the character of blanco while the hogs-
heads of tobacco were discharging our
second mate who suffered from strabis-
mus more painfully than almost any cross-
eyed man i ever saw became excessively
provoked with one of the native boat-
men who had been employed in the serv-
ice it is probable that the negro was
insolent which the mate thought proper to
chastise by throwing staves at the kroo-
mans head the negro fled seeking ref-
uge on the other side of his canoe but
the enraged officer continued the pursuit
and in his double-sighted blundering ran
against an oar which the persecuted black
suddenly lifted in self-defense i know
not whether it was rage or blindness or
both combined that prevented the ameri-
can from seeing the blade but on he
dashed rushing impetuously against the
implement severing his lip with a frightful
gash and knocking four teeth from his
upper jaw

  the luckless negro instantly fled to
the bush that night in an agony of
delirium caused by fever and the fear of
deformity the mate terminated his exist-
ence by laudanum

  the african law condemns the man who
draws blood to a severe fine in slaves pro-
portioned to the harm that may have been
inflicted accordingly the krooman inno-
cent as be was of premeditated evil now
lay heavily loaded with irons in don pe-
dros barracoon awaiting the sentence
which the whites in his service already de-
clared should be death he struck a
white they said and the wound he in-

    sea-

flicted was reported to have caused that
white mans ruin

  luckily before the sentence was exe-
cuted i came ashore and as the trans-
action occurred in my presence i ventured
to appeal from the verdict of public opin-
ion to don pedro with the hope that i
might exculpate the krooman my sim-
ple and truthful story was sufficient an
order was instantly given for the blacks
release and in spite of native chiefs and
grumbling whites who were savagely
greedy for his blood don pedro persisted
in his judgment and sent him back on
board the reaper

  the character manifested by blanco on
this occasion and the admirable manage-
ment of his factory induced me to seize
a favorable moment to offer my services
they were promptly accepted and in a
short time i was employed as principal in
one of don pedros branches

chapter xl

he vey natives on this river and its
neighborhood were not numerous be-
fore the establishment of spanish
factories but since  when several
cuban vessels arrived with rich merchan-
dise the neighboring tribes flocked to the
swampy fiats and as there was much sim-
ilarity in the language and habits of the
natives and emigrants they soon intermar-
ried and mingled in ownership of the soil

  in proportion as these upstarts were edu-
cated in the slave trade under the influ-
ence of opulent factors they greedily ac-
quired the habit of hunting their own kind
and abandoned all other occupations but
war and kidnaping as the country was
prolific and the trade profitable the thou-
sands and tens of thousands annually sent
abroad from gallinas soon began to ex-
haust the neighborhood but the appe-
tite for plunder was neither satiated nor
stopped by distance when it became neces-
sary for the neighboring natives to extend
their forays and hunts far into the inter-
ior in a few years war raged wherever
the influence of this river extended the
slave factories supplied the huntsmen
with powder weapons and enticing mer-
chandise  so that they fearlessly advanced
against ignorant multitudes who too silly
to comprehend the benefit of alliance
fought the aggressors singly and became
their prey


sea stories

  still the demand increased don pe-
dro and his satellites had struck a vein
richer than the gold coast his flush bar-
racoons became proverbial throughout the
spanish and portuguese colonies and his
lookouts were ceaseless in their signals of
approaching vessels new factories were
established as branches north and south of
the parent den mana rock sherboro
sugarei capt mount little cape mount
and even digby at the door of monrovia
all had depots and barracoons of slaves
belonging to the whites of gallinas

  but this prosperity did not endure the
torch of discord in a civil war which was
designed for revengeful murder rather
than slavery was kindled by a black paris
who had deprived his uncle of helen
every bush and hamlet contained its
achilles and ulysses and every town rose
to the dignity of troy

  the geographical conflagration of the
country as i have described it isolated al-
most every family of note on various
branches of the river so that nearly all
were enabled to fortify themselves within
their islands or marshy flats the prin-
cipal parties in this family feud were the
amarars and shiakars amarar was a
native of shcbar and through several
generations had mandingo blood in his
veins shiakar born on the river con-
sidered himself a noble of the land and
being aggressor in this conflict disputed
his prize with the wildest ferocity the
whites who are ever on the watch for
native quarrels wisely refrained from
partisanship with either of the combatants
but continued to purchase the prisoners
brought to their factories by both parties
many a vessel bore across the atlantic
two inveterate enemies shackled to the
same bolt while others met on the same
deck a long-lost child or brother who had
been captured in the civil war

  the conflict was terminated by the
death of amarar for several months this
savage had been blockaded in his stockade
by shiakars warriors at length a sortie
became indispensable to obtain provisions
but the enemy were too numerous to jus-
tify the risk upon this amarar called
his soothsayer and required him to name
a propitious moment for the sally

  the oracle retired to his den and after
suitable incantations declared that the ef-
fort should be made as soon as the hands
of amarar were stained in the blood of

his own son it is said that the prophet
intended the victim to be a youthful son
of amarar who had joined his mothers
family and was then distant but the im-
patient and superstitious savage seeing a
child of his own two years old at hand
when the oracle announced the decree
snatched the infant from his mothers
arms threw it into a rice mortar and
with a pestle mashed it to death

  the sacrifice over a sortie was ordered
the infuriated and starving savages roused
by the oracle and inflamed by the bloody
sccne rushed forth tumultuously amarar
armed with the pestle still warm and reek-
ing with his infants bood was foremost
in the onset the besiegers gave way and
fled the town was reprovisioned the for-
tifications of the enemy demolished and the
soothsayer rewarded with a slave for his
prediction

he first expedition upon which don
pedro blanco dispatched me re-
vealed a new phase of africa to my
eyes i was sent in a small portuguese
schooner to liberia for tobacco and here
the comfortable government house the
neat public warerooms the large immigra-
tion home designed for the accommoda-
tion of the houseless the clean and spacious
streets all convinced me that there was
in truth something more in these ebony
frames than an article of commerce and
labor i paid the bill eagerly-considering
that a document printed in africa by ne-
groes under north american influence
would be a curiosity among the infidels of
gallinas

  my engagements with blanco had been
made on the basis of familiarity with the
slave trade in all its branches but my
independent spirit and impatient temper
forbade from the first the acceptance of
any subordinate position at gallinas ac-
cordingly as soon as i returned from the
new republic don pedro desired me to
prepare for the establishment of a branch
factory under my exclusive control at new
sestros an independent principality in the
hands of a bassa chief

  i lost no time in setting forth on this
career of comparative independence and
landed with the trading cargo provided for
me at the kroomens town where i
thought it best to dwell till a factory could
be built

  an african as well as a white man must
adventures of an african slaver



be drilled into the traffic it is one of
those things that do not come by nature
yet its mysteries are acquired like the
mysteries of commerce generally with
much more facility by some tribes than
others i found this signally illustrated
by the prince and people of new sestros
and very soon detected their signal inferi-
ority to the soosoos mandiugos and
veys

  for a long time their conduct was so
silly arrogant and trifling that i closed
my chests and broke off communication
besides this the slaves they offered were
of an inferior character and held at exor-
bitant prices still as i was commanded
to purchase rapidly i managed to collect
about seventy-five negroes of medium
grades all of whom j designed sending
to gallinas in the schooner that was tug-
ging at her anchor off the beach

  at the proper time i sent for theblack
prince to assist me in shipping the slaves
and to receive the head money which was
his export duty on my cargo the answer
to my message was an illustration of the
character and insolence of the ragamuffins
with whom i had to deal the prince
dont like your sauciness don theodore
and wont come till you beg his pardon by
a present

  it is very true that after my visit to
their republic i began to entertain a greater
degree of respect for black men yet my
contempt for the original unmodified race
was so great that when the princes son a
boy of sixteen delivered this reply on be-
half of his father i did not hesitate to
cram it down his throat by a backhanded
blow which sent the sprig of royalty bleed-
ing and howling home

  it may be easily imagined what was the
condition of the native town when the
boy got back to the palace in less than
ten minutes another messenger arrived
with an order for my departure from
the country before next day at noon-an
order which the envoy declared would
be enforced by the outraged townsfolk un-
less i willingly complied

  now i had been too long in africa to
tremble before a negro prince and though
i really hated the region i determined to
disobey in order to teach him civilized
manners accordingly i made suitable prep-
arations for resistance and when my
hired servants and barracooniers fled in
terror at the princes command i landed

some whites from my schooner to aid in
protecting our slaves

  by this time my house had been con-
structed of the frail bamboos and matting
which are exclusively used in the buildings
of the bassa country  had added a cane
veranda or piazza to mine and protected
it from the pilfering natives by a high
palisade which effectually excluded all in-
truders within the area of this inclosure
was slung my hammock and here i ate
my meals read wrote and received princes
as well as the mob

  at nightfall  loaded twenty-five mus-
kets and placed them inside my sofa which
was a long trade chest i covered the deal
table with a blanket beneath whose pen-
dant folds i concealed a keg of powder
with the head out hard by under a
broad-brimmed sombrero lay a pair of
double-barreled pistols with these dis-
positions i swung myself asleep in the
hammock and leaving the three whites to
take turns in watching never stirred till an
hour after sunrise when i was roused by
the war drum and bells from the village

  in a few minutes my small inclosure of
palisades was filled with armed and gib-
bering savages while his majesty in the
red coat of a british drummer but without
any trousers strutted pompously into my
presence i assumed an air of humble
civility and leading the potentate to one
end of the guarded piazza where he was
completely isolated from his people i sta-
tioned myself between the table and the
sombrero some of the princes relations
attempted to follow him but according to
established rules they dared not advance
beyond an assigned limit

  when the formalities were over a
dead silence prevailed for some minutes
i looked calmly into the princes eyes and
waited for him to speak still he was
silent at last getting tired of dumb
show i asked the negro if he had come
to assist me in shipping my slaves the
sun is getting rather high said i and
we had better begin without delay

  did you get my mesasge was his re-
ply and why havent you gone

  of course i received your message i
returned but as i came to new sestros at
my leisure i intend to go away when it
suits me besides this prince freeman i
have no fear that you will do me the least
harm especially as i shall be before you
in any capers of that sort


sea stories

  then by a sudden jerk i threw off the
blanket that hid the exposed powder and
with pistols in hand one aimed at the keg
and the other at the king  dared him to
give an order for my expulsion

  it is inconceivable how moving this
process proved not only to freeman but
to the crowd comprising his bodyguard
the poor blusterer entirely cut off from
his companions was in a laughable panic
his tawny skin became ashen as he
bounded from his seat and rushed to the
extremity of the piazza and to make a
long story short in a few minutes he was
as penitent and humble as a dog

  i was of course not unforgiving when
freeman advanced to the rail and warn-
ing the blacks that he had changed his
mind ordered the odorous crowd out of
my inclosure before they departed  made
him swear eternal fidelity and friendship
in their presence after which i sealed the
compact with a couple of demijohns of
new england rum

  before sunset seventy-five slaves were
shipped for me in his canoes and ever
after prince freeman was a monument
to the virtues of gunpowder physic

    chapter xlt

his summary treatment convinced
the kroo and fishmen of new ses-
tros that they would find my break-
fast parties no childs play bold bravado
had the best effect on the adjacent island
as well as the immediate coast the free
blacks not only treated my person and
people with more respect but began to
supply me with better grades of negroes
so that when don pedro found my suc-
cess increasing he resolved to establish a
permanent factory and enlarged my com-
mission to ten slaves for every hundred i
procured

  thereupon i at once commenced the
erection of buildings suitable for my per-
sonal comfort and the security of slaves
i selected a pretty site closer to the beach
a commodious two-story house surrounded
by double verandas was topped by a look-
out which commanded an ocean view of
vast extent and flanked by houses for all
the necessities of a first-rate factory
there were stores a private kitchen a
rice house houses for domestic servants
a public workshop a depot for water a
slave kitchen huts for single men and

sheds under which gangs were allowed to
recreate from time to time during day-
light the whole was surrounded by a
tall hedge fence thickly planted and en-
tered by a double gate on either side of
which were long and separate barracoons
for males and females the entrance of
each slave pen was commanded by a can-
non while in the center of the square i
left a vacant space whereon i have often
seen seven hundred slaves guarded by half
a dozen musketeers singing drumming
and dancing after their meals

  it is a pleasant fancy of the natives
who find our surnames rather difficult of
pronunciation while they know very little
of the christian calender to baptize a new-
comer with some title for which any chat-
tel or mrechandise that strikes their fancy
is apt to stand godfather my exploit with
the prince christened me powder on the
spot but when they saw my magnificent
establishment beheld the wealth of my
warehouse and heard the name of store
i was forthwith whitewashed into
storee

  and storee without occupying a legis-
lative seat in africa was destined to ef-
fect a rapid change in the motives and
prospects of that quarter in a few
months new sestros was alive the iso-
lated beach which before my arrival was
dotted with half a dozen kroo hovels now
counted a couple of flourishing towns
whose inhabitants were supplied with mer-
chandise and labor in my factory the
neighboring princes and chiefs confident
of selling their captives struggled to the
seashore through the trackless forest and
in a very brief period prince freeman
who no likee war over my powder keg
sent expedition after expedition against
adjacent tribes to redress imaginary griev-
ances or to settle old bills with his great-
grandfathers debtors there was no ab-
solute idea of extending the area of free-
dom or of territorial annexation but it
was wonderful to behold how keen became
the sovereigns sensibility to national
wrongs and how patriotically he labored
to vindicate his countrys rights it is
true this african metamorphosis was not
brought about without some sacrifice of
humanity still i am confident that during
my stay greater strides were made toward
modern civilization than during the visit
of any other factor

  when i landed among the handful of
adventures of an african slaver



savages i found them given up to the
basest superstition all classes of males
as well as females were liable to be accused
upon any pretext by the jujumen and the
dangerous saucy-wood potion was invari-
ably administered to test their guilt or in-
nocence it frequently happened that ac-
cusations of witchcraft or evil practices
were purchased from these wretches in or-
der to get rid of a sick wife an imbecile
parent or an opulent relative and as the
poisonous draft was mixed and gradu-
ated by the jujuman it rarely failed to
prove fatal when the drinkers death was
necessary ordeals of this character oc-
curred almost daily in the neighboring
country destroying numbers of innocent
victims of cupidity or malice  very soon
observed the frequency of this abominable
crime and when it was next attempted in
the little settlement that clustered round
my factory  requested that the accused
might be locked tip for safety in my
barracoon till the fatal liquid was prepared
and the hour for its administration ar-
rived

  it will be readily understood that the
saucy-wood beverage like any other may
be prepared in various degrees of strength
so that the operator has entire control of
its qualities if the accused has friends
either to pay or tamper with the medicator
the draft is commonly made weak enough
to insure its harmless rejection from the
culprits stomach but when the victim
is friendless time is allowed for the entire
venom to exude and the drinker dies ere
he can drink the second bowl

  very soon after the offer of my barra-
coon as a prison for the accused a kroo-
man was brought to it accused of causing
his nephews death by fatal incantations
the juju had been consulted and con-
firmed the suspicion whereupon the
luckless negro was seized- ironed and de-
livered to my custody

  next day early the jujuman ground his
bark mixed it with water and simmered
the potion over a slow fire to extract the
poisons strength as i had reason to be-
lieve that special enmity was entertained
against the imprisoned unclc i called at
the jujus hovel while the medication was
proceeding and with the bribe of a bottle
requested him to impart triple power to
the noxious draft my own juju i
said had nullified his by pronouncing the
accused innocent and i was exceedingly

anxious to test the relative truth of our
soothsayers

  the rascal promised implicit compliance
and i hastened back to the barracoon to
await the fatal hour up to the very
moment of the drafts administration
i remained alone with the culprit and
administering a double dose of tartar
emetic just before the gate was opened i
led him forth loaded with irons the
daring negro strong in his truth and con-
fident of the white mans superior witch-
craft swallowed the draft without a wink
and in less than a minute the rejected
venom established his innocence

  this important trial and its results were
noised abroad throughout the community
the released krooman told his compan-
ions of the white-man saucy-wood admin-
istered by men in the barracoon and ever
afterward the accused were brought to
my sanctuary where the conflicting charm
of my emetic soon conquered the native
poison and saved many a useful life in
a short time the practice was discontinued
altogether

uring the favorable season i had
been deprived of three vessels by
british cruisers and for as many
months had not shipped a single slave-
five hundred of whom were now crowded
in my barracoons and demanded our ut-
most vigilance for safe keeping in the
gang i found a family consisting of a
man his wife three children and a sis-
ter all sold under an express obligation
the father was captured by my blackguard
friend prince freeman in person and the
family had been secured when their vil-
lage was subsequently stormed

  barrah was an outlaw and an especial
offender in the eyes of an african though
his faults were hardly greater than the
deeds that bestowed honor and knight-
hood in the days of feudalism he was
the discarded son of a chief in the interior
and had presumed to blockade the public
path toward the beach and collect duties
from transient passengers or caravans
this interfered with freeman and his
revenues but in addition to the pecu-
niary damage the robber ventured on sev-
eral occasions to defeat and plunder the
princes vagabonds so that in time he be-
came rich and strong enough to build
a town and fortify it with a regular stock-
ade directly on the highway all these


sea stories

offenses were so heinous in the sight of
my beach prince that no foot was suffered
to cool till barrah was captured once
within his power freeman would not have
hesitated to kill his implacable enemy as
soon as delivered at new sestros but the
interference of friends and perhaps the
conviction that a live negro was worth
more than a dead one induced his high-
ness to sell him under pledge of cuban
banishment

  barrah made several ineffectual attempts
to break my barracoon and elude the
watchfulness of my guards so that they
were frequently obliged to restrict his lib-
erty deprive him of comforts or add to
his shackles in fact he was one of the
most formidable savages i ever encoun-
tered even among the thousands who
passed in terrible procession before me in
africa one day he set fire to the bam-
boo matting with which a portion of the
barracoon was sheltered from the sun
for this he was severely lashed but next
day when allowed under pretense of ague
to crawl with his heavy irons to the kitchen
fire he suddenly dashed a brand into the
thatch and seizing another sprang toward
the powder house which his heavy shackles
did not allow him to reach before he was
felled to the earth

  freeman visited me soon afterward and
in spite of profit and liquor insisted on
taking him back but in the meantime the
bassa chief to whom my prince was sub-
ordinate heard of barrahs attempt on
my magazine and demanded the felon to
expiate his crime according to the law of
his country at the stake no argument
could appease the judges who declared
that a cruel death would alone satisfy the
people whose lives had been endangered by
the robber nevertheless i declined de-
livering the victim for such a fate

  in the end we compromised the sen-
tence by shooting barrah in the presence
of all the slaves and townsfolk-the most
unconcerned spectators among whom were
his wife and sister

here is no river at the new ses-
tros settlement though geographers
with their usual accuracy in african
outlines have often projected one on
charts and maps two miles from the
short and perilous beach where i built
my barracoons there was a slender stream
which in consequence of its shallow bed

and narrow rock-bound entrance the na-
tives call poor river but my factory
was at new sestros proper and there as
i have said was no water outlet from the
interior in fact nothing but an embayed
strand of two hundred yards flanked by
dangerous cliffs such a beach open to
the broad ocean and forever exposed to
the full rage of its storms is more or less
dangerous at all times for landing and
even when the air is perfectly calm the
common surf of the sea pours inward with
tremendous and breaking waves which
threaten the boats of all who venture among
them without experienced skill indeed
the landing at new sestros would be im-
practicable were it not for the dexterous
kroomen whose canoes sever and sur-
mount the billows in spite of their terrific
power

  kroomen and fishmen are different
people from the bushmen the two for-
mer classes inhabit the seashore exclu-
sively and living apart from other african
tribes are governed by their elders under
a somewhat democratic system the bush-
men do not suffer the kroos and fishes
to trade with the interior but in recom-
pense these expert boatmen maintain des-
potic sway along the beach in trade with
the shipping as european or yankee
boats cannot live in the surf i have de-
scribed the kroo and fishmen have an
advantage over their brothers of the bush
as well as over the whites which they are
not backward in using to their profit in
fact the bushmen tfight travel steal and
trade while the kroos and fishes who
for ages have fringed at least seven hun-
dred miles of african coast constitute the
mariners without whose skill and boldness
slaves would be drugs in caravans or bar-
racoons and this is especially the case
since british french and american cruis-
ers have driven the traffic from every nook
and corner of the west coast that even re-
sembled a harbor and forced the slavers
to wait in open roadsteads for their prey

  the kroo canoes wedgelike at both
ends are hollowed from the solid trunk
of a tree to the thickness of an inch they
are so light and buoyant that they not
only lie like a feather on the surface of
the sea so as to require nothing but free-
dom from water for their safety but a
canoe capable of containing four people
may be borne on the shoulders of one or
two to any reasonable distance accord-
adventures of an african slaver



ingly kroomen and fishmcn are the pets
of all slavers traders and men-of-war that
frequent the west coast of africa while
no one dwelling on the shore engaged in
commerce is particularly anxious to merit
their displeasure

  when i landed at new sestros i
promptly supplied myself with a little fleet
of these amphibious natives and as the
news of my liberality spread north and
south along the shore the number of my
retainers increased with rapidity indeed
in six months a couple of rival towns-one
of kroos and the other of fishes-hailed
me severally as their commodore and con-
sul with such auxiliaries constantly at
hand i rarely feared the surf when the
shipment of slaves was necessary at
gallinas under the immediate eye of don
pedro the most elaborate care was taken
to secure an ample supply of these people
and their boats and i doubt not that the
multitude employed in the establishments
prime could at a favorable moment dis-
patch at least a thousand slaves within the
space of four hours yet i have heard
from kroomen at gallinas the most har-
rowing tales of disaster connected with the
shipment of negroes from that perilous
bar even in the dry season the mouth
of this river is frequently dangerous and
with all the adroitness they could display
the kroos could not save boatload after
boatload from becoming food for the rav-
enous sharks

nwas quite afloat at new sestros on
the tide of success when the cruiser
that for a while had annoyed me
with a blockade became short of food and
was obliged to bear away from sierra
leone my well-paid spy-a krooman
who had been employed by the cruiser-
soon apprised me of the brigs departure
and its cause so that in an hour the beach
was in a bustle dispatching a swift canoe
to gallinas with a message to don pedro
the coast is clear-send me a vessel-
relieve my plethora

  forty-eight hours were hardly over
when the twin masts of a clipper brig
were seen scraping along the edge of
the horizon with the signal for embarka-
tion i was undoubtedly prepared to wel-
come my guest for kroos fishes bush-
men bassas and all had been alert since
daybreak ready to hail the craft and re-
ceive their fees there had been a gen-

eral embargo on all sea-going folks for a
day before so that there was not a fish
to be had for love or money in the set-
tlement minute precautions like these are
absolutely necessary for all prudent slavers
for it was likely that the cruiser kept a
spy in her pay among my people as well
as i did among hers

  all therefore was exceedingly com-
fortable so far as ordinary judgment could
foresee but alas the moon was full and
the african surf at such periods is fear-
fully terrific as i listened from my
piazza or gazed from my bellevue it roared
 the strand like the charge of inter-
minable cavalry my watchful enemy had
been several days absent and i cxpected
her return from hour to hour the ship-
ment though extremely perilous was
therefore indispensable and four short
hours of daylight alone remained to com-
plete it i saw the risk yet taking counsel
with the head kroo and fishmen i per-
suaded them under the provocation of
triple reward to attempt the enterprise
with the smallest skiffs and stoutest
rowers while a band of lusty youths stood
by to plunge in whenever the breakers cap-
sized a canoe

  we began with females as the most dif-
ficult cargo for embarkation and seventy
reached the brig safely then followed
the stronger sex but by this time a sea
breeze set in from the southwest like a
young gale and driving the rollers with
greater rapidity upset almost every alter-

a bright flash brought to recollection a
quantity of venetian beads of mock coral
which i had stowed in my chest they
happened at that moment to be the rage
among the girls of our beach and were
irresistible keys to the heart of every belle
now the smile of a lip has the same magi-
cal power in africa as elsewhere and the
offer of a coral bunch for each head em-
barked brought all the dames and damsels
of sestros to my aid such a shower of
chatter was never heard out of a canary
cage mothers sisters daughters wives
sweethearts took charge of the embarka-

strands of false coral or the kiss of a

by stan warburton

modern fishing on the banks

      eam trawling is the least ro-
y -a mantic method of fishing mr
sjpj john graham president of the

- portland trawling company

made the remark to me as he pointed to
a steam fishing vessel moored outside his
office window i looked out at the sea
gull unloading her cargo of fish at the
famous fulton fish market in new york
she was a tiny boat for deep-sea work
about the size of a large tug a few serv-
ice stripes of rust showed along her storm-
battered steel hull her black smokestack
was half hidden by a white covering of
salt evaporated from ocean spray lung-
over the ship during a storm which had de-
layed her last return but she had arrived
safely at last

  half an hour later i sailed on the little
ship straight out into the forbidding at-
lantic she plowed far from sight of land
where twenty-one men and myself bounceci

about during eight days of blusterous
ever-changing march weather there 
saw the fishermen scrape a finny cargo
from the very bottom of the sea three
hundred feet below we encountered a
slight storm three days of -treacherous
fog and lived with the ever-present un-
certainty of those who dare to rob king
neptunes domain our fortunes changed
every two hours when the fishermen
hauled their net perhaps a load of fish
would come up from the unseen depths
below but often only a few torn strands
of the net which had met disaster the
cause of which we could only guess dur-
ing this time we dodged submarine wrecks
that would tear away our gear rocks that
would cut it to pieces and heavy marine
growths whose terrific weight would snap
the steel cables to which the net was
fastened until we returned to new york
with our hard-earned catch the fishermen


sea stories

did not know what their reward would be
that depended on an ever-fluctuating fish
market-it might be a bare existence or
it might be luxury

  while we were steaming out of new
york harbor on the unromantic little ship
apologetically creeping between faster and
more luxurious boats i entered the wheel-
house from curiosity i glanced at the
captains license framed in accordance
with marine law i received a shock as
i read that herbert green could safely
be intrusted with the duties as master of
any ship regardless of size on all the
seven seas a magnificent ocean liner
was tearing past to leave us wallowing in
its aristocratic wake i was amused to
realize that the brass-buttoned captain of
the luxurious ship and the skipper of the
fish-smelling sea gull both possessed the
same navigation license

  with respect i looked at our captain
he was a powerful heavy-set man dressed
in old half-worn work clothing without
tie or hat his face was heavily lined
from the effects of many years of strenu-
ous ocean life and the responsibilities that
never leave a ships master but
strangely the lines curved around his
mouth in a smile that seldom left his face
he slouched beside an open window oc-
casionally giving directions to the helms-
man whom he called by his first name in
democratic friendliness

  thats a fine license captain i re-
marked i know men whod give their
right arm for that

  he waved aside the compliment its
nice to have unlimited papers lie ad-
mitted but i only use them on these
fish boats they pay better than most sea
jobs but if youre interested in seamen
watch the men on this ship theyre all
real sailors as well as fishermen

  i learned he was right they were a
rough hard-working group of men most
of them newfoundlanders of irish de-
scent their talk was rough often vulgar
and most outspoken but never vicious
enough to be repulsive they constantly
joked among themselves and no one was
safe from their practical jokes though in
their work they helped each other in every
way possible there was not a shirker in
the crew-the hardships of a fishermans
life weed out such before they can learn
the trade

  when we were out to sea i went into

the forecastle tt was a triangular-shaped
room below the forward deck running
back from the peak of the ship a distance
of about thirty feet where it spread out
to nearly the same width heat was fur-
nished by a coal stove bolted to the center
of the floor along the three sides were
double bunks the room was illuminated
by three electric lights and ventilated only
by the protected companionway leading
down from the deck above

  my bunk was on the upper tier at the
rear end of the room in a narrow space
about five feet above the deck i had a
straw mattress a similar pillow and two
blankets below my bunk was the only
free space in the forecastle where the
fishermen hung their oilskin clothes any
time the air was not too overladen with
tobacco smoke my nose could tell that i
was on a fish boat there was no wash-
basin in the room nor any place on the
ship for that matter there simply wasnt
room for such luxuries

  twelve fishermen and myself lived in
this overcrowded forecastle the mem-
bers of the crew welcomed me in a free
easy manner which made me feel at home
immediately their attitude seemed to be
that because i was on the ship i was one
of them a friend without further cere-
mony

  my first meal on the boat was a pleas-
ant surprise the mate a good-natured
boisterous man led me down a steep com-
panionway into the small galley situated be-
low decks in the rear of the ship here i
found myself in a small stuffy room
whose only floor space was occupied by a
large ships range and a good-sized table
i was squeezed in between two fishermen
the table was laden with large pots of
corned beef and cabbage and other plain
but nourishing well-prepared food at
both ends of the table was a big pan filled
with loaves of bread and beside each a
large butcher knife about the size of a
pirates cutlass

  as i was crowded into the table with
barely room to move and the method of
serving as well as eating was strange i
resolved to copy the mate to be sure i
made no fishboat blunders at my place
was a large soup plate following the
mates lead i had a bowl of soup after-
ward we both filled the same plates with
meat and potatoes and started the second
course
hauling the trawl



  suddenly the mate grabbed a loaf of
the bread in one hand the cutlass in the
other and holding both high in the air
to give himself elbow room dodged his
neighbors ear while he beheaded a large
hunk of the bread i did not eat any bread
myself-i was afraid of committing mur-
der in my unaccustomed awkwardness

  dessert of canned peaches we ate from
the same dishes after the meal i still
mimicked the mate and dropped my ver-
satile soup plate into the dishwater but
i learned to add another detail to the for-
mula when i thought my hands needed
attention i would wash the tableware my-
self to dry it-and incidentally my hands-
on a towel hanging over the stove

  the cook or steward as he was called
stopped me as i started to leave the gal-
ley come down here any time for a
mug up he invited there is always
something to eat

  as he said the table was always set
there were cookies various left overs and
other food waiting for any one who cared
to eat and on the stove were pots of
strong tea and coffee the only obliga-
tion of one who took a mug up was to
rinse and dry the dishes afterward this
proved to be another valuable assistance to
personal cleanliness

  about forty hours from new york we
reached the west end of the famous
georges banks over a hundred miles
out to sea from boston here we started
to fish the method of beam trawling is
unique in that the fish are caught from
the floor of the ocean by actual pursuit
a large net is used shaped very much
like a shallow paper bag the bottom
portion of this is let down till it scrapes
along the bottom of the ocean while be-
ing towed by the steamer the top of the
net is some distance above and slightly
ahead of the lower portion the theory
is should a fish be frightened by the net
dragging over the bottom and swim up to
evade it he would already be surrounded
by the canopy of net above the net
funneled backward to a strong heavy bag
in which the fish were corralled

  originally the two ends of the net were
held apart by a long beam which gave
this type of fishing its name but an
ingenious device called doors or otter
trawls have replaced the cumbersome
beams these are massive planks much
the shape and size of a door protected by

steel edges which scrape along the bottom
one is fastened to each end of the net at
an angle which keeps them separated by
the resistance of the water with the use
of doors the modern beam trawl will spread
out to a width of over one hundred feet
the doors used on the sea gull had been
imported from england where they are
made also for the famous north sea
trawlers who fish by similar methods and
from ships of about the same size and de-
sign as the american boats

  when we started to fish a sounding
showed that we had about three hundred
feet of water beneath us we dropped the
net and towed it for two hours as it
was hauled up i stood on the small bridge
near the captain when the doors and
open end of the net were alongside i
watched him gaze intently at the waves a
short distance from the ship suddenly
he turned to me with a look of triumph

  we got a good bag of fish he cx-
claimcd look at all those bubbles

  i looked where he pointed bubbles of
air were coming to the surface as i
watched they increased in number until
the effect of their breaking smoothed a
small circle on the water then a dark-
green mass of color appeared below which
grew in size and changed to a lighter
green suddenly i saw the bag of our
net coming to the surface amidst the
bubbles inside the net was a large quan-
tity of fish the laden net approached
the surface buoyed up by the air within
the fish caught from that great depth it
increased its speed as it ascended until it
flashed above the surface and the top of
the bag rose over a foot in the air from
the force of its momentum

  it floated on the water while the fisher-
men pulled it in to the ship they threw
a line about the bag and hauled it over
the side with the powerful steam winch
where it hung suspended a few feet over
the forward deck it looked like an in-
verted balloon of fish about the height of
a man

  two men crawled under the bag to un-
fasten the lower end which was tied to-
gether with a large rope when they
loosened the knot a deluge of fish plunged
down on the deck knocking them from
their feet where they swirled about amid
the finny cargo squirming and kicking
the men and fish avalanched down the
deck until stopped by a wooden obstruc-


sea stories

tion cheers and laughter from the
others rewarded the two luckless fisher-
men who seemed to enjoy the experience

  all right boys put her out again the
captain instructed again the net was
dropped and we started another two-hour
tow that first bag contained about
eight thousand pounds of fish an unusu-
ally large haul most of the catch was
haddock but there were also a few valu-
able cod as soon as the net was out
the fishermen started dressing the fish a
task that was not completed until time to
haul the net again the fish passed
through several hands as they were care-
fully cleaned washed and pitched down a
hatch into the hold to be packed on ice
brought from shore

  while the fish were being dressed a
new member of the crew appeared it
was his duty to collect the livers from the
cleaned fish and extract the oil for medic-
inal purposes a large steam vat was
carried on the top deck for this use

  from then on the fishermen worked
constantly they were divided into two
watches the captains and the mates each
working for six hours followed by rest
periods of the same length as daylight
was unnecessary for this type of fish-
ing the crew worked without a single let-
up for almost a week it was hard back-
breaking work at all times

  every two hours there was the thrill-
ing expectancy of a hauled net and the
excited watch for the telltale bubbles our
largest bag was about ten thousand
pounds of fish our smallest--and a very
frequent occurrence-nothing obstruc-
tions on the ocean bottom three hundred
feet below frequently tore the net to
shreds this required hard fast work to
repair it while an ever-ready spare net
was used one evening we tore up four
nets in as many settings and as the cap-
tain remarked we did not catch enough
fish for chowder during that eight hours

  twice a day the captain was in com-
munication with new york by radio
which was the only modern navigation
equipment on the boat it proved to be
most useful as it allowed the officers
of the portland trawling company a
subsidiary of the atlantic coast fisheries
company to act as a clearing house of
information they knew how much fish
the sea gull had caught as well as all
other ships in the large fleet the exact lo-

cation of each and could advise boats
which were not catching their share to
move to better locations

  most of the fish caught were haddock
but in addition we captured quite a num-
ber of cod and two large halibut the
net also brought up a number of freak
fish which were not saved one haul con-
tained nothing but a load of dogfish a
worthless fish in reality a small harmless
shark another freak was the skate a
flat fish with wide wings at each side of
its body and a long spinelike tail we
also caught a number of a vicious-looking
gray fish which the crew called the catfish
this sometimes grows to over twenty
pounds in weight and has a large power-
ful mouth well supplied with teeth it
has a vicious habit of clamping onto any-
thing within reach and hanging  like
a bulldog until it can be lifted off the deck
by its mouth

fog descended over the fishing
banks  the second day as we
cruised about hidden in the treacher-
ous mist we sounded our whistle with dis-
tracting regularity frequently we could
hear the warning blasts of other vessels as
they passed by but they were seldom
dangerously close enough to be seen
there was always the uncertainty of a fast
ocean liner tearing through the mist to cut
our frail craft in two

  three days later the fog cleared to give
us beautiful calm weather but the barom-
eter slowly dropped as a sign of approach-
ing trouble a slight storm broke on the
following morning

  by noon the waves were mounting and
the little sea gull was beginning to jump
and roll as the wind increased spray
and occasional blue water came over her
bow as she stuck her nose into the waves
when the fishermen hauled the net the
side of the little boat was turned directly
against the waves contrary to all rules of
a ship in a storm but this position
helped the fishermen as the vessel rolled
over so far at each wave that it assisted
them in hauling the net frequently her
weather rail dipped under the waves al-
lowing quantities of water to swamp over
the men as they worked

  late that afternoon  stood on the small
rear deck watching the ship toss through
the storm first i would be on top of the
jvorld looking down on the angry waves
hauling the trawl



below then at the very bottom deep in a
canyon of raging water though the sea
gull bounced and jumped with erratic mo-
tion and rolled till her decks were awash
she proved that she was a good sea boat
no heavy waves came over her bow or
stern and she disposed of what little water
did come aboard on the next roll as the
captain had told me she was able to ride
the waves like her namesake and was per-
fectly safe in any weather-unless some-
thing went wrong

  while i stood with my landlubbers feet
braced against the bouncing deck and with
a firm hold on a hand rail one of the fish-
ermen staggered alongside  i volunteered
it was getting a little choppy

  he smiled all over if it will only
keep blowing he prayed

  why do you want that i asked in
surprise

  keep the smaller boats inside-itll
mean a better price for our fish

  his explanation made me realize that
the trawlers are essentially a bad-
weather fishing boat they can fish in
almost any storm or if the weather gets
too bad for even them they can lay-to
outside waiting for the waves to subside
they endure all kinds of weather fog
sleet snow hail gales which upset all
maritime schedules to creep into port
bringing cargoes of fish with surprising
regularity during the winter months the
steam trawlers reap their largest monetary
reward for they are about the only fish-
ing vessel which can venture out to sea
af that perilous season

  the wind subsided during the night so
that before morning i could lie in my
bunk without hanging on as we fished
that day the captain told me that he was
particular not to trawl over a certain area
where a submarine paid a visit during the
late war three vessels had been sunk
there to remain as a constant menace to
any fish net that tried to pass over them
the captain held little resentment for the
actual torpedoing of these boats but lie
felt that the enemy could have sunk them
at least a little distance from the haddock
banks

  the chief engineer shut off the electric
lights that day so that he could repair the
generator engine while he worked on the
forward deck using a flange of the
anchor for an anvil i talked with him
his life was a hard one during the

eight or ten days his boat is at sea the
engines are in constant use at the end
of each trip he has twenty-four hours in
port during this otic day he must do the
necessary repair work besides stealing
what time lie can for shore pleasure yet
he must somehow keep the engines turn-
ing-lives might depend on that

  while we were talking a fisherman
climbed to the very top of the forward
mast where he hung like a steeple jack
as he replaced some worn tackle ropes
a cold wind was blowing and the ship was
rocking slightly which made him swing
dizzily as on the end of a lever it seemed
to me that he clung to his high perch for
an interminable time when he at last
climbed down the engineer shook his head
these fishermen are darned good sailors
he admitted few ships carry as good
men these days

  in need of a stimulating cup of coffee
i went to the galley i had to cross the
main deck where my rubber boots slid in
the fresh slime that is always present
where fish are cleaned it was dark below
for only two candles tried to replace the
usual electric lights but i thought i knew
my way about as i stepped past the
cook in the narrow quarters my foot
splashed into a pail of water something
soft and oozy gave under my rubber boot
i jerked it out and apologized to the stew-
ard

  thats all right he replied you
didnt hurt anything i was only peeling
potatoes

  splash another tuber dropped into the
water that had just washed my boot

  with the crew i ate potatoes at the next
meal one cant be too particular on a
fish boat

  on the fifth day of our fishing as i
was standing in the whcelhouse the radio
operator entered with a message for the
captain we were called into new york
without hesitation the skipper went to the
chart made a mark to indicate our position
and quickly worked out a course to sandy
hook during the five days of our er-
ratic wandering about the fishing banks he
had known our exact location at all times
his only source of information other than
that given him by experience was gained
from the depth of water and the type of
bottom as indicated by some butter placed
on the base of the sounding lead he was
not compelled to use his sextant once cer-


sea stories

tainly clever navigation of a specialized
sort when we were steaming back to
new york i asked the captain how this
trip would pay the fishermen

  we cant tell that till we dock he an-
swered it all depends on the fish mar-
ket we have a fair catch one hundred
and thirty-five thousand pounds of fish
and the price was good yesterday accord-
ing to the wireless reports but it might
be anything by the time we get there

  when we reached jjort we found that
the market was fairly high so the fisher-
men were well repaid for their efforts i
had made a trip with them during good
weather when the work of fishing was as
light as it was possible to be but as a
landlubber i was willing to concede that
they had earned every cent received

  on the morning following our return
habit formed on the sea gull caused me to

notice the weather a cold northeast wind
was blowing driving a piercing rain which
threatened to turn into snow i knew that
the little sea gull was bravely plowing
out to the operr sea once more-for a
trawler is a rough-weather boat she goes
when the time comes storm or no storm
in my mind i pictured the twenty-one men
headed for the storm-tossed sea in that
tiny shell of steel i remembered the fish-
erman who prayed for foul weather be-
cause it would increase his financial re-
ward  wondered how this weather would
please him

  i sat down near the protecting comfort
of a warm radiator perhaps i should
write of my experiences on the sea gall
but how should i begin oh yes of
course-

sealing in the southern ocean

n   joined the auxiliary bark-
entine sound of jura bound for
the kerguelen islands via cape-
town she was a four-masted
barkentine of nine hundred and thirty-
tons register carrying twenty-one hands
all told owned by irvine  johnson of
north shields

  originally a simon-pure windjammer
she had been converted into an auxiliary by
having a small steamers engines-either a
whaler or drifter-fitted aft and her
lower hold was partitioned off into tanks
for the carrying of whale oil et cetera
from south georgia in which trade she
had been employed for several years

  on this voyage she had a slight variation
from her usual run being chartered to
bring home seal oil from the kerguelen
islands a dreary spot in the southern
ocean roughly speaking halfway between
the cape of good hope and west aus-
tralia in about fifty degrees south lati-
tude

  we left birkenhead on the second of
july under the command of captain f

crosby and chief mate rangdale in
charge of a tug that had orders to take
us to the northwest lightship although
we had steam up our own engines were
only capable of driving her four to five
knots in favorable circumstances so they
did not trust her to her own power in the
strong mersey currents

  when the tug cast off we made all sail
to a light fair wind and made our way
down channel at an average speed of
seven knots sail and steam combined

  i	said all sail but she did not spread the
amount of canvas she had been sparred
for

  all her square sails were all right also
the mainsail but her mizzen and spanker
were merely leg-of-mutton trysails which
with two very sketchy gaff-topstails did
little toward driving her

  we had a rather uneventful passage of
sixty-odd days to capetown where we
stayed for a month refitting also waiting
for the rest of the fleet which consisted of
two ex-gunboats which had had an extra

             sea-
johnsons navy



deck fitted on them and been converted
into small tankers-also two drifters
when this imposing fleet was assembled in
table bay some wag dubbed us john-
sons navy and dignified us with the
title of flagship

  the two kil boats and the drifters were
sent on to kerguelen ahead of us with
about a hundred men to start the fishing
while we followed later with coal and
stores

  we also had a couple of dozen whalers
as passengers in our fore tween decks
they were mostly norwegians but we had
a couple of south africans among them
who i think were more actuated by the
spirit of adventure than desire to partici-
pate in the oil industry anyhow they
were the liveliest members of the com-
munity who were for the most part a
rather silent and gloomy lot

  these men though dignified by the title
of whalers were a long way removed from
the real thing especially of the old whale-
ship days they were in reality laborers
engaged for the most part in very greasy
toilsome and monotonous work ashore

dhe sound of jura was the luckiest
ship i have ever leen in though
slow and clumsy to handle something
always turned up to enable her to achieve
her object when leaving liverpool we
had fair winds and fine weather till we
were well clear of the channel so now
on leaving capetown our luck still held
about a week after leaving the cape we
struck the westerly winds in about forty-
two degrees south and they blew a living
gale before which we ran until we sighted
the islands

  in fact at times it blew a little too hard
and one night we hove her to but she be-
haved very badly-lying in the trough of
the sea and rolling horribly the mate
indeed was of the opinion that it would
have been better to continue running i
did not agree with him at the time but on
looking back i now feel sure that he
was right  think that kerguelen is very
magnetic

  i remember that for twenty-four hours
before we sighted the island the compass
was badly affected spinning round and
round as if possessed making it impos-
sible to steer by so we steered by the
wind keeping it dead aft till we sighted
the land

    sea-

  that day the gale moderated very rap-
idly by midday it was a flat calm
enabling us to use the engine and steam
up royal sound which we would never
have been able to do under sail there
were no pilots and no tugs in that part
so if the weather had not favored us we
should probably have blown past it alto-
gether however we anchored off the
station which was situated at the head of
the fiord thirty or forty miles from the
entrance  call it a fiord because it par-
took of all the characteristics of a nor-
wegian fiord having deep clear water all its
length with wild mountainous scenery

he morning after our arrival we
moored at a little jetty which had
been constructed by some previous
expedition and started in discharging
coal an operation with which i was all
too familiar having discharged many
cargoes in the old days in the chilean ni-
trate ports but this beat all my going
a-fishing

  we had a steam winch of course but
the weather was bitter cold making a wash
at night a thing to be dreaded in addition
to our other woes the lower holds were
divided into tanks so we had no skin to
work on but had to dig the coal out of the
limbers separately

  well should that place be called the isle
of desolation i never was in a more
dqleful place a peculiar and depressing
sense of isolation and dreariness gripping
you if you happened to wander alone it
is of volcanic origin with rugged bleak
and mountainous scenery interspersed with
deep fiords or sounds scapa flow was
paradise in comparison

  while we discharged coal the station
gang was busy with their sealing t he
small steamers namely the kil boats and
the drifters would cruise around the
island landing their crews at any accessible
spot where seals were congregated they
would kill and flense as many as possible
load the skins aboard the ship and take
them back to the station where they would
be hauled up by the shore gang who took
them to the cooking house where the blub-
ber-skin and all-was boiled down into
oil

  the seals which in reality were sea
elephants were often of enormous size
some of the old bulls being as weighty as
an ordinary bullock while their teeth or
tusks were four to five inches long the


sea stories

smaller cows or calves could be clubbed
to death but the larger bulls had to be
shot as their virility no less than their
stupidity was marvelous a couple of
seals would lie side by side basking in the
sun and when you approached them would
take no notice only opening their large
saucerlike eyes to gaze at you for a few
seconds then sleeping again

  their eyes were very large and perfectly
round of a rich dark-brown color but
with a peculiar fishlike glaze in them and
when they opened them the water was con-
tinually running as if they were weeping

  one of our chaps-ginger-thought
it would be a good idea to take a sealskin
home with him so he tackled a small seal
on his own fie took a pick with him and
scientifically hacked its brains out and set
about skinning it which operation took
him about two hours to his horror the
unfortunate animal persisted in moaning
even when it had been brained and skinned
iinger stuck to his gruesome task for
itwo hours but eventually gave it up and
fled remorseful the hearts and livers
of these seals were good eating and i
have seen the hearts still beating hours
after being extracted from the animals

x sundays we would ramble about
digging rabbits out of their holes
some rabbits had been imported by
a prewar expedition and had spread aw-
fully a species of small sea bird about
the size of a dove gray in color had taken
to living with the rabbits in their bur-
rows and when dug out would be pounced
upon and eaten by large sea hawks

  the island also sported sheep and dogs
left by previous expeditions the sheep
which were magnificent black fellows fat
as butter with wool a yard long lived
and flourished on a species of winter cab-
bage which grew in some parts

  the heads of the station made several at-
tempts to get a sheep but failed and it was
left to some of us amateur hunters in the
forecastle to succeed

  they lent us a rifle and half a dozen
of the chaps crossed the sound and even-
tually sighted a sheep and ran or rather
scrambed him down

  i dont know if it was a sheep or a ram
but its horns were three feet long from
tip to tip not curly but nicely curved
and it was so big and clumsy and the
wool so long and matted that it trailed on
he ground and made the animal slower

than us the sailors grabbed him and
held him down till the rifleman arrived on
the scene who placed the muzzle of his
rifle against his ribs and with great accu-
racy blew a hole in his midship section

  so far so good but now our troubles
arose the prize was too big and heavy
to carry slung to an oar and it took the
boats crew four hours of heavy dragging
up hill and down dale to get him to the
boat next day the cook skinned him and
he certainly was a beauty his chest was
like a barrel and it was the finest mutton
i have ever tasted also the darkest in color
and very rich and juicy

  our success stimulated the nobs to fur-
ther efforts but though they made several
attempts they never suceeded in bagging
another

  some dogs of different breeds had been
left on the island and had bred and mul-
tiplied they seemed to be reverting to
type being of a yellowish brown rather
like a collie in appearance but sturdier
and with shorter and shaggy hair one of
our fellows collared a puppy in a rabbit
hole and a wild and plucky little beggar
he was the doctor of the station took a
fancy to him and the captor agreed to let
him have it but after we had had him a
month some fathead took him ashore for
a run-he ran all right

had a pig aboard which became a
rcat favorite in the cold weather
le was bedded down under the fore-
castle head on an old tarpaulin and care-
fully covered if we neglected to see to
her in the evening she would come to the
forecastle door and shove her snout over
the step and squeal and whimper until she
was attended to her soft grateful
runts after she was tucked up for the night
with just the tip of her snout sticking out
were most comical on the passage home
when the skipper finally decided to have
her killed the negro cook flatly refused to
do the deed and the mate attended to it

  the cook also made a pet of a penguin
which he claimed talked to him but he
was finally persuaded to liberate the bird
as it did not thrive 

  we also used to collect the penguins
eggs which we made into omelets but i
never cared for them without actually
being fishy they did not taste right and
probably very few of them were fresh as
when opening them we could only con-
demn those which were actually bad

  on the whole our diet was very mo-
notonous consisting of sea stores-salt
beef el cetera-from the time we left
capetown to when we returned there-a
matter of nearly seven months

  we had christmas day on the island
a holiday tor every one and sounds of
jubilation emanated from the bunk houses
ashore and we had as good a dinner as
the ships stores would provide but 
liquor the skipper suffered from a mys-
terious inward malady which necessitated
copious libations of rum-therefore the
keg was empty while at dinner we were
startled by a terrific explosion ashore one
of the south africans an ex-soldier in
a laudable attempt to show his mates how
mines were worked in france had
burgled the ammunition store and suc-
ceeded in blowing up a large shed luck-
ily no one was hurt

  in the afternoon we had a football
match-ships crew versus the station-
remarkable more for enthusiasm than
science we started with even numbers
but the shore gang seeing the game go
against their side took to joining in in-
creasing till we were swamped by sheer
weight

  the referee a frenchman stood on
the side lines frantically blowing his
whistle and clapping his hands and after
a couple of hours furious scramble over
the rocks we asked for the verdict and got

it-sixteen goals to eight in favor of the
station

  we were about four months at ker-
guelen discharging coal and loading the
oil as it was boiled down a small pipe
led from the cooking house to the jetty
from which we ran it into our tanks the
tween decks being loaded to capacity with
barrels

  heaven only knows how many seals it
took to produce a ton of oil as only the
skins and about a couple of inches of fat
adhering to them went into the cookers

  finally we were loaded-fourteen hun-
dred tons of oil in all this did not rep-
resent the whole of the seasons catch as
sealing was carried on after our departure
and the two kil boats also loaded oil after
we left probably in the neighborhood of
a thousand tons between them

  the longed-for day had arrived and the
sound of juras luck held good we had
a fine day for our departure steamed down
the sound and got well clear of the land
before the westerlies -struck us again with
full force and we made good speed on a
northerly course into the indian ocean and
trade winds and made capetown on our
homeward way without any trouble

  we touched at capetown for bunkers
and provisions had a fine-weather passage
home and docked in birkenhead on the
th of may  being away ten months
and a half
a matter of stripes

by philip scruggs

north sea battle tactics

fs just a matter of stripes mor-
gan told himself as he reluctantly
left the window where he had been
watching the officers farewell
dance lie looked down at his sleeve where
the four red stripes and the crossed guns
marked his rating a first-class gunners
mate if they were gold he continued
i could walk in there and have some
chance with that sap who can show me
up just because his college happened to
be the naval academy and mine was the
university

  morgan lund felt that he had every
right to grouse about his present predica-
ment the montana was due to steam out
of the harbor for the war zone at dawn
and his girl was in there dancing with
mart samson whose gold stripe made him
a privileged person he wouldnt even
have a chance to tell betty good-by and
there was no telling when he would see
her again he turned the collar of his

pea-jacket up and drifted against the wind
down toward the dock no use staying
ashore with nothing to do

  as he started undressing two of his
best friends drifted in also tired of hang-
ing around the town with nothing to do
like himself they were college men who
had joined the navy and far from home
found nothing in the town to interest them
they were just plain gobs but lund didnt
feel that the dignity of his red stripes made
him any better than they were it was
more or less an accident of his technical
training that had won them for him and
the fact that he had always been interested
in gunnery

  bob james noticed the glum look on
lunds face and after a moments hesita-
tion said you look downhearted whats
up  i thought you were all excited about
this war-zone assignment

  lund didnt reply for a moment but
needing an outlet for his feelings finally
a matter of stripes



burst forth its that damn samson just
because he is an ensign he is in town danc-
ing with betty and i dont even get a
look-in to tell her good-by the dirty
skunk even had the nerve to ask me before
he went ashore if there was any message
i would like to give betty as he was tak-
ing her to a dance he only did it to get
a rise out of me he knows i hate his
gall but hes a gold-striper he added
bitterly hes an officer and a gentle-
man the last word was uttered in a
tone of contempt as an afterthought he
added to himself gentleman-by act of
congress

   wouldnt worry about it bob said
sympathetically if she is the kind of
girl she looks to be mart samson wont
make much time with her though hes a
pretty smooth bird it is tough though
lund not seeing her your last night

  the two sailors went out and lund
tumbled into his bunk prepared for a
sleepless night

  he was still awake and tossing rest-
lessly when the faint light of dawn crept
through the portholes the sound of run-
ning footsteps on deck followed by the
steady vibration of the cruiser told him
they were ready to leave he didnt bother
to go on deck to watch the land fade away
but sulked below content to glance out of
the porthole at the shipping drifting by in
the harbor

  when he finally went on deck he saw a
faint hazy line on the horizon back of
them and that was as near a good-by as
he gave his homeland his thoughts turned
to the cruise ahead there might be ac-
tion in the north sea that would give him
a chance to change his red stripes for gold
ones the lips tightened in his lean brown
face as he determined to come back an
officer if there was any possible way of
achieving it he scowled openly as he
saw samson cross the deck glance at him
hesitate and then go on

  at dusk as they steamed rapidly ahead
through a choppy sea a signalman came
up to him and handed him a note glanc-
ing at it he saw his name and beneath it
kindness of ensign samson it was
from betty expressing regret at not see-
ing him again and wishing him the best
of luck on the cruise

  he felt a warm glow steal over him as
he read the intimate little note and then
his pent-up rage against samson burst

forth afresh he had deliberately waited
all day to give him the note and was prob-
ably standing out of sight and grinning
at his discomfiture ill show him up
the dirty cad he muttered

  tucking the note in his blouse lie went
below

 he montana was steaming along at
 half speed through the sullen green
waters of the north sea when com-
mands started snapping from the bridge
full speed ahead close the bulkheads
stand by the guns raise to two thousand
yards begin firing

  the last order had hardly left the cap-
tains mouth when a deafening salvo heeled
the montana far over as the smoke
cleared away fresh shells were shoved
home the breechblocks slammed and be-
fore the cruiser ceased trembling a second
round thundered from the secondary bat-
tery

  lund was in charge of one of the for-
ward guns and at the first sharp command
had swept the sea and spotted the periscope
sinking below the waves his heart
jumped as his roving eyes picked up the
foamy trail of a torpedo rushing toward
them but it had been seen in time and the
deadly missile passed astern missing them
by a scant margin at the command to be-
gin firing lunds gun was ready and the
great shells plowed up the water where the
periscope had been seen a moment before

  cease firing the gunners stood by
sweeping the surface with keen eyes but
nothing was visible the sub had been
content to launch her torpedo and seek the
safety of deep water the shells were a
moment too late

  for a while they steamed around cut-
ting back and forth across the area where
the sub had submerged but their trouble
was useless a mere cautious formality
and soon they were back to their half-
speed monotonous patrol

  lund had just relaxed after seeing that
the guns were blown out and reloaded
when samson came by a bit slow get-
ting into action lund he observed we
should have gotten that sub she was an
easy target there was a half sneer on
his face as he glanced at lund and passed
on lund started to speak but checked
himself mentally adding one more item to
his score against the gold-striper

  the entire personnel of the cruiser was


sea stories

aware of the enmity between the two men
the crew all sympathized with the gun-
ner as they had little liking for the ensign
who made mountains of the tiny tasks
which he assigned them and which would
have been beneath the notice of most men
in his position

  the officers those of them who bothered
to consider the matter at all attributed it
to jealousy on the part of lund they
had little sympathy for the college men
who had enlisted for the war and rather
resented their presence on the ship  hey
knew too much and were too inclined to
demonstrate that but for their lack of
annapolis training they were as good as
the officers

  the only officer who paid any attention
at all to lund and who secretly took his
side was lieutenant orcutt who knew of
him through mutual friends and appreci-
ated the fact that he was a fine chap and
possessed of more intelligence and ability
than samson he occasionally stopped to
chat with lund and made it known that
any influence he possessed would be ex-
erted in his behalf whenever the occasion
for its use arose

  orcutt came up to lund as he was strik-
ing a match preparatory to lighting his
pipe what has samson got against
you he asked

  nothing sir except the fact that we
are both in love with the same girl and
he suspects that she likes me better than
himself i heat him once in an intercol-
legiate boxing meet but he showed no
hard feelings about it then he may think
more of it now and want to get back at
me

  well pay no attention to him outside
of ship routine he can do you no harm
and will only hurt himself by being misty
to you

  i do not notice him sir any more than
possible lund said quietly by the
way is there any chance of seeing any
action soon outside of this interminable
cruising back and forth

  orcutt looked at him a moment and
then answered his question this is con-
fidential at present but we are waiting
for orders to go after an enemy cruiser
that is reported through the mine barrier
and heading for the north atlantic the
orders have evidently come he added as
a signalman handed a message from the
wireless room to the captain and almost

immediately the cruiser gathered speed
and shifted her course more to the north
orcutt left and joined the captain on the
bridge

  something was certainly happening as
the knots were reeled off and smoke
poured from the stacks to level and spread
out behind them darkness was shutting
them in rendered more impenetrable by a
heavily overcast sky a sudden tension
spread among the crew captain wright
paced the bridge nervously the other
officers were gathered in groups talking
excitedly in low voices unintelligible to
the crew

  lund saw the signalman who had been
up on the bridge and stopped him
whats up he asked

  the signalman grunted some more
ghost chasing i suppose wireless just
came sending us after a cruiser thats sup-
posed to have slipped out

  where is she lund asked eagerly
his face lit up maybe they would get
into action after all

  heading for the north atlantic around
scotland said the signalman we ought
to sight her about daybreak if she holds
her course then you birds can use your
popguns and see if you can hit anything
he grinned derisively and started away

  run along and wave your hags little
boy he sent after the retreating figure
he was almost visibly excited over the
news he forgot all about samson and
turned in to dream of betty having a
vision of himself standing in front of
her with his sleeve literally dripping with
gold braid

efore the light of the false dawn
had died away leaving a heavier
blackness than before the crew was
standing by ready for action eyes and
ears were strained for any sign that might
indicate the presence of a ship in that black
void that surrounded them the engines
were still turning over at full speed and
she was holding steadily to her north-
westerly course

  they were about forty nautical miles off
kinnairds head the tip of that great
bulge of scotland between the firth of
forth and moray firth when the gray
light crept over the sea if the reports
had been accurate they should intercept
the enemy before he got past the head and
into the sweep of water beyond
a matter of stripes



  lund almost turned and struck out with
his fist which had automatically clenched
when a voice behind him said sarcastically
think you can hit this cruiser if we catch
her lund 

  samson was standing there with the
usual nasty grin on his face the gum
ners standing near by half expected lund
to hit him as they saw his expression in
the dim light but lund controlled him-
self

  yes sir he replied i think we will
knock her into scrap iron-provided-he
hesitated-provided we get the range in
time

  he knew samson caught the meaning
beneath his words as he saw his face flush
angrily samson was the range officer for
his battery and thinking of the delayed
note from betty lund had not been able
to resist the thrust

  you need not worry about that sam-
son retorted angrily you handle the
guns and-attend to your own business
he turned to pretend an inspection of the
guns knowing that the crew were grin-
ning at the thrust lund had made though
they didnt know its significance

  a light breeze came out of the east and
swept away the mist hovering above the
sea it swirled in little columns assumed
fantastic shapes as keen eyes waited for
it to clear then it was gone suddenly
showing a heaving angry sea sweeping
away to the horizon and the call came
high and clear through the damp air
ship ahead to the right and close upon
it the commands full speed ahead
find the range stand by for action
hurry up now

  lunds crew sprang to their guns ele-
vation sixty commence firing

  the montana reeled as the guns spoke
smoke swept across the decks the fa-
miliar odor of burning powder filled the
air the gunners worked with precision
breechblocks swung open compressed air
cleaned the barrels shells were shoved
home the breechblocks slammed the ship
rocked as the second round sought the
enemy lund glanced at samson who
was busy with his instruments but he
caught his eyes as he looked up his eyes
blazed as he shouted

  elevation fifty-five and in a lower
voice attend to your guns damn you
lund im handling this end again the
guns roared lund repressed a grin as

he gave orders to the gunners urging
them to greater speed

  the enemy cruiser was clearly visible
her funnels belching as she tried to run
away puffs of smoke sprang from her
and white jets of water flew up ahead of
the montana they were returning the
fire

  hold your fire came the command
high above the din the course changed
slightly as the enemy shifted hers appar-
ently turning away commence firing
the guns spoke again and as their smoke
cleared away a cloud of black smoke could
be seen to the west the wireless was
bringing up a fleet of destroyers

  they were overhauling the fleeing
cruiser she fired round after round but
the range was alternately short or too
great until a sudden explosion seemed to
check the montanas speed for a moment
and she heeled over slightly from the shock
a shell had almost overreached them
but not quite exploding soon enough to
twist and bend the plates amidships and
rip a section of the deck to splinters the
crew on that side had jumped back almost
going overboard at the explosion but no
one was hurt lund glanced up before
returning to the guns samson was just
ahead of him

  with a warning shout the gunner
jumped toward samson just as a bulkhead
torn loose by the explosion but held in
position by the braces for a moment
started to topple he reached samson and
shoved him aside with a lunge like a foot-
ball player breaking through a line

  samson was safe but as lund tried to
clear the bulkhead hit him a glancing blow
and sent him sprawling to the deck he
lay there very still but as the crew started
to pick him up his eyes opened and he
inhaled deeply getting slowly to his feet
im all right he gasped but his back
ached and his right leg was numb with
pain get that gun going he barked
angrily

  samson was back on the job looking a
little dazed and every now and then glanc-
ing at lund when the latter wasnt looking
his face was a picture of indecision but in
a moment it set and he started checking the
range

  both ships were zigzagging to baffle the
gunners but the montana was justly
famed for her marksmanship more than


sea stories

oncc her shells had reached the enemy the
results being evidenced by her lessened
speed as her guns roared spasmodically
they could see that she was in desperate
straits and trying to accomplish by rapid
firing what she lacked in marksmanship

  when the enemy cruiser slowed down
it was like target practice for the mon-
tanas gunners the calibrated batteries
started knocking the enemy to pieces as
if she were made of wood instead of being
a heavily armored powerful modern
cruiser her own guns had scored but
once on the montana and lund had pre-
vented the only near approach to a fatality

  the range became point-blank as the
enemy drifted helplessly either her en-
gines or her steering mechanism had been
put out of commision and most of her
guns were silenced the remaining ones
however roared futilely sending up harm-
less jets of water where the shells dropped

  as the montana swung around a final
salvo from the starboard guns almost
knocked the cruiser out of the water a
cloud of smoke poured from her figures
could dimly be seen hurling themselves
overboard or being hurled by the force
of the explosion the sound of which came
crashing across the water like the concen-
trated fire of all the guns in the world
her guns were silent as she was seen to
be settling a man vanished over her
side as the stern went down her prow
came up she leaned heavily to one side
and leaving a cloud of smoke and steam
floating above the water she disappeared

  they steamed over the spot where the
enemy went down but no sign remained
except a smear of oil over the sea and
bits of gear that had been blown into the
water officers and crew stared silently at
the heaving water as they went by not
a trace of the figures they had seen going
overboard could be found they snapped-
to to clean up ship

  as the tension relaxed lund found
himself acutely conscious of the pain in
his leg and back he limped forward and
reported to the ships surgeon a hasty
examination revealed strained ligaments
but nothing was broken he was ordered
to bed for a few days rest and assured
that he would soon be all right

  the montana with the fleet of destroy-
ers put about -and steamed toward aber-
deen for repairs the damage caused by
the one enemy shell was temporarily

patched up and they proceeded slowly to
port

  lund looked up in surprise to see sam-
son standing by his bunk  he officer
looked like lie had a bad taste in his mouth
but his face was set with determination to
get a difficult task quickly over with
lund i came to thank you for what you
did you probably saved me from a nasty
smash and i am sorry that you were hurt
on my behalf the words came slowly
with obvious effort

  it is what i would have done for any
man mr samson lund replied abruptly
no thanks are necessary he stressed
the any man in a way that samson un-
derstood to mean that he would have pulled
a dog out of the way in the same manner
-ie went out with flushed face furious to
be under obligation to the man he had
taken every opportunity to make uncom-
fortable why hadnt any other man be-
side lund saved him now he would at
least have to be decent to the beggar when
any one was around

iffg week in aberdeen put the person-
ij nel of the montana in better spirits

     they were treated royally by the
scots and every man of them was sorry
to leave as they steamed out to sea again
lund was up and though his back still
ached a bit he felt competent to go about

his duties

  day followed day monotonously as they
took up the dreary patrol again a driz-
zling rain settled over the water to add
to the misery they longed for the wire-
less room to bring orders for some new as-
signment to send them into action again
their one taste of battle had edged their
appetites for action and made the routine
patrol additionally colorless

  the red ball of the sun one morning
found the clouds gone a rare day of
sunshine and bright-blue skies followed
toward noon smoke was sighted to the
east and shortly after a squadron of brit-
ish cruisers hove in sight the montana
joined them and there was much specu-
lation among the crew as a fleet of destroy-
ers and mine sweepers were added toward
sundown signal flags made fluttering
white specks against the sky the wireless
room was a scene of constant activity with
messages flashing to and from the bridge
at dusk the newly formed fleet steamed
slowly toward the east
a matter of stripes



  as the squadron held steadily on its
course speculation became certainty they
were going toward the- enemy coast and
perhaps they were at last really going to
get into the war

  lund listened with some amusement at
the remarks of the crew dont forget
them eggs they got spread around rum-
bled one old salt they got em just a-s
thick off the coast as weve got em across
the sea therell have to be some sweepin
and blowin up before we get through
and them submarinesll be thickern her-
rin

  he voiced the opinions of many of them
who were nervous over the prospect of
getting through the mine fields though not
worried about the idea of furious battle

  well if that cruiser we sunk got
through  guess we can with mine sweep-
ers and destroyers to clear the way in-
terposed a man in lunds crew that
is if mr samson doesnt have charge of
the sweepin he glanced at lund as he
made the last remark he was trying to
get a rise out of his chief and find out
how he stood with the ensign since the
battle but lund ignored the remark

  you neednt worry about the mines
men he said with a serious tone the
real danger will be submarines or getting-
led too far in and attacked by superior
numbers without a chance to call up the
reserve squadron that is supposed to stand
by for our call ship to ship well run
em off the sea but we might get a sur-
prise

  daylight found them entering the area
of danger the sweepers were combing
the sea ahead followed by destroyers
dropping depth bombs with fuses timed
to wreck any mines near the surface
steaming slowly after came the cruisers

  standing near his gun lund was
aroused from contemplation of the de-
stroyers by lieutenant orcutt wre are
going to see fighting now lund if the
enemy will come out if they dont we
will have been to just so much trouble for
nothing

  i have been wondering sir lund re-
marked why we are here at all they
are harmless bottled up there it looks
like taking needless chances running in
here

  its for the moral effect orcutt re-
plied the troops are getting it a bit
hard at the front and the people in eng-

land and back home are pretty glum about
it the british staff thought a run up
here with a short scrap would divert their
attention and also throw a scare into the
enemy they lapsed into silence for a
few minutes watching the sweepers at
their dangerous task

  that was a pretty fine thing you did
for samson orcutt presently observed
the old man commented on it youll
probably hear from it before we get out
of these waters did samson have any-
thing to say

  he thanked me said lund embar-
rassed

  hes a good officer as far as his work
is concerned he just takes himself a bit
too seriously orcutt was trying to be
reassuring

  yes hes a good officer lunds
voice tended to belie his words he had
certain definite notions of an officers con-
duct and samson didnt live up to those
notions

  orcutt left and went up on the bridge
where captain wright was pacing up and
down keeping a sharp lookout for any
developments

  the hours passed and the sun shone
down through a burnished haze that spread
across the sky a stiff breeze was begin-
ning to whip the green water into white-
caps and made the sweepers work more
difficult a sharp lookout was maintained
for submarines as the fleet proceeded cau-
tiously soon the destroyers ran up sig-
nal flags and the fleet responded with more
speed quickly they drew into battle for-
mation led by the destroyers still no
sign of the enemy

  a quick fusillade of shots preceded by
puffs of smoke showed the destroyers
going into action no enemy was visible
from the montana but the shells from the
little craft were plowing up the water
ahead signal flags ran up a subma-
rine a torpedo had been seen and a
periscope sighted

  the crews jumped to the guns the
destroyers continued firing then they
stopped suddenly and the crew of the
cruiser could see them dropping depth
bombs overboard a shudder ran through
the montana the water ahead heaved
slightly and bubbles rose to the surface
followed by a film of oil that spread slowly
over the sea the first enemy was done
with


sea stories

  the fleet steamed on an ominous quiet
followed the flurry of action and the quick
death of the submarine a call came from
the lookout all eyes strained to the hori-
zon where smoke clouds had suddenly ap-
peared quickly they were followed by
the rakish hulls of cruisers

  fire was withheld awaiting the com-
manders orders lund was thinking of
betty thinking of the note in his pocket
and picturing the cruiser steaming into the
harbor on the other side of the atlantic
he suddenly came out of his momentary
revery amazed that his mind should have
strayed away at such a time

  puffs of smoke appeared all down the
enemy line and shells started throwing up
geysers ahead of the destroyers the gun-
ners itched to get into action but still the
command was withheld the enemy were
sweeping around in a circle firing bat-
tery after battery and gradually lifting the
range until the shells dropped dangerously
close

  elevation forty-nine commence fir-
ing and the montana went into action
before her smoke cleared away the brit-
ish cruisers took it up and salvo after
salvo swept thunderously across the wa-
ter up and down the battle line one
after another the batteries spoke

  the enemy shells were getting close
one of the destroyers turned and limped
out of range with her funnels and gear
amidships blown away by a shell a shell
crashed into the leading british cruiser
and made a shambles of her deck an-
other one smashed a turret into silence
but the enemy were getting their share
an explosion was followed by a gap in
their battle line the funnels of a cruiser
vanished as if cut away by a giant knife

 a submarine was spotted shells
sought it where the periscope rose fell
rose and fell started to sink and vanished
as lund trained a gun on it and the shell
tore up the water cheers rang out from
the crew and were picked up by the brit-
ishers the gunner had a mixed feeling
of horror and elation as he thought of the
shattered steel hulk beneath the waves

  a british cruiser went slowly out of
line her stern looked as if she had
backcd into something the gear was shot
away and the armor plate was caved in
bent and twisted

  the fleet kept up the terrific unceasing
fire battery by battery all down the line

the puffs of smoke shot out followed by
the roar of guns that seemed far away to
the ears of men half deafened by the re-
ports

  a strange humming sound filled the air
between the reports of guns heads
turned uneasily eyes searching for the
source the humming grew louder and
faces turned to the sky to see a silvery
cigar-shaped dirigible coming out of the
eastern sky it was barely visible against
the curious haze that had been slowlyshut-
ting out the heavens around it was an
escort of planes looking like tiny birds in
comparison

  then the unexpected stand of the enemy
cruisers became apparent somehow they
must have had warning of the fleet that
was cutting through the mine barrier and
had been sent out to hold them until the
dirigible could arrive the warships below
began to spread out zigzagging but keep-
ing up their fire at the enemy fleet anti-
aircraft batteries were uncovered and the
gunners stood by until the ominous new
enemy got within range

  circling swiftly it swept over the fleet
and the batteries started firing the puffs
of the exploding shells could be seen break-
ing below the silver monster but they
were short something black dropped from
beneath the huge airship and a mass of
water was blown into the air where it
struck a rush of water like a small tidal
wave spread in concentric circles big
enough for the cruisers to feel its lift as
it passed the water began to leap up
here and there as the planes added their
smaller bombs to the attack they were
daring in their swooping dives above the
cruisers and scored hit after hit though
the damage was no more than a bit of
shattered gear or a ripped deck but they
were a serious menace and were interfer-
ing with the fire of the big guns

  lund man the forward air battery
and get that plane if she comes over
again lieutenant orcutts voice was
sharp and demanded results but lund
knew that he was doing him a favor he
ran swiftly to the short squat guns that
pointed toward the sky their fire so far
had been wholly futile the gunners had
had little experience with them and at
best they were never very effective

  the big bombing plane with the enemy
insignia marked on her wings was circling
a matter of stripes



back as lund set himself to swing the
guns she started her dive between the
intervals of gunfire he could hear the wind
screaming through wires and struts as she
came headlong toward the montana he
pressed the automatic release of the gun
and sent five shells soaring upward in the
path of the rushing plane they were
short but as the plane came on the shells
screeched into the sky the rush of air from
their explosion rocking the plane violently
almost hurling it over

  another shell sped skyward and the
sound of the explosion came faintly as the
white smoke spread for a moment hiding
the plane then a shout came from all
the crew who were not manning the guns
the plane had checked its dive was slip-
ping turning with a wing crumpled and
almost torn loose now it was dropping
straight for the water flames streamed
from the motor and spread to the wings
and fuselage it crashed into the sea
there was a hiss followed by a muffled
explosion and the plane was gone

  hardly had the spontaneous cheer died
away when an explosion came that dwarfed
the sound of the great guns nearly split
already aching eardrums and even halted
the enemy fire as a british cruiser holding
the center of the formation vanished in a
holocaust of flame and smoke one of
the enemy ships had scored a direct hit
and her shells had wiped out the cruiser
as if she had never existed before the
smoke cleared away she had disappeared
completely bits of wood and steel and
scraps of something too horrible to de-
scribe rained into the sea and on the
decks

  the battle was suspended as abruptly
as if the command to cease firing had been
given all eyes stared in horror at the
cloud of drifting smoke

  the black smoke thickened from the
enemy funnels as they prepared to quit the
battle the british and american guns
roared with redoubled fury in a last at-
tempt at revenge for the vanished cruiser
it was clean load fire-clean load fire-
as shells rained after the escaping fleet
they had suffered terribly but that last
blow for the moment wiped out every-
thing else the signal was made to cease
firing an almost oppressive silence de-
scended on the fleet men spoke in low
voices some of them almost deafened
by the noise shouted to each other to stop

suddenly in the midst of a sentence star-
tled at the sound the expedition was
over

  the destroyers deployed to front and
rear and on both sides as the cruisers came
about to retrace their path the sun was
sinking rapidly and they were anxious to
get away from mines and lurking subma-
rines weary famished men went below
for food and coffee the watch remain-
ing on deck were brought theirs in steam-
ing cans

  lund was unutterably tired his nerves
were on edge and he wanted nothing so
much as to pile into his bunk and sleep
he had a momentary feeling of satisfac-
tion when he thought of the plane he had
sent crashing

  lucky shot lund congratulations
a strained voice came out of the darkness
he recognized it as samsons

  thank you lunds voice was sar-
castic guess it was lucky mr samson
no range finder to tell me how to shoot
he didnt care if samson was an officer
he was too weary and overwrought to
have that cad being nasty again he ex-
pected the usual overbearing rebuff but
none came he went below for the luxury
of a cigarette none were permitted on
deck a light might bring a torpedo out
of the black void that surrounded them

  lund had dozed off sitting on the edge
of his bunk when he was awakened by
sudden activity and low-spoken commands
stand by quiet no lights then
an officer came around and reported ships
off in the darkness going by on the star-
board side

  when lund reached the deck some one
placed a hand on his arm and said lis-
ten he could hear a sound faint but
unmistakable the throbbing of engines

  the order was passed around to wait
until the destroyers which had gone to
front and rear should throw their search-
lights on the hidden vessels the minute
a ship stood out they were to fire they
would be easy targets picked out of the
darkness by the glare of the lights after
the first round the cruisers would throw
on their lights

  great shafts of blinding white light sud-
denly cut through the darkness they
swept to a converging point then out and
back quickly lifting guttural shouts
came across the water sharp commands
the lights focused on a cruiser picked up


sea stories

others the guns crashed as the enemy
picked up speed great spurts of flame
shot out with the thunder of the guns
seeming to roll the darkness and silence
back to the rim of the sea

  immediately the searchlights of the
cruisers shattered the remnants of dark-
ness and the enemy stood pitilessly re-
vealed the guns crashed again and the
exploding shells could be clearly seen as
they threw up fountains of water around
the enemy it was- point-blank deadly
firing

  the enemy took up the challenge their
searchlights gleamed hard and white as
the shafts swept blindingly across the fleet
their guns crashed battery by battery
sweeping down the line but almost imme-
diately they could be seen putting about

  suddenly an enemy cruiser seemed to
leap from the water as an explosion lit up
the surrounding water for miles with a
weird red glare a second explosion fol-
lowed the first one as the cruisers maga-
zine took fire she seemed to bend to
break in two then settled back and
quickly horribly was gone in turning
she had hit one of the dreaded mines

  the disaster struck panic into the en-
emy they fired wildly almost at ran-
dom as they came about and retraced their
course shafts of light swept crazily
across the water across the sky lighting
up murky clouds of smoke drifting over-
head

  as the baffled enemy steamed away at
full speed lund thought it looked like a
giant spectacle a war show staged be-
neath the brilliant glare of searchlights
only the blowing up of the cruiser gave it
reality that and the still screeching shells
that sped after them and he mut-
tered aloud these damn mines that are
still drifting around

  almost as suddenly as it had started
the battle was over it had lasted only a
few minutes but it seemed hours the
engines throbbed again as they went ahead
he noticed a figure standing near by it
was- orcutt he turned as lund moved
toward him

  well lund we have seen a bit of
action after all you handled your gun
well i am sure you were responsible for
that cruiser we sent down early in the
first scrap not a bad record with the
sub and plane that we know you wrere
responsible for

  lucky there is one officer who notices
what the gunners do thought lund he
was to find that orcutt wasnt the only
one who noticed

he next morning as they steamed
through safe waters heading for
their base lund was called to the
bridge captain wright grasped his hand
and said i am glad to say mr lund
that your record on the montana can be
rewarded especially since yesterdays
fine work i have received acknowledg-
ment by wireless of a recommendation
for the promotion that i sent in to the
admiral when we reach our base you
will receive a commission as ensign until
then you will be treated as an officer of
that rank

  lund left the bridge in a daze an
ensign recommended by the old man
and he didnt think captain wright even
knew he was on the ship betty-gold
stripe-samson the thoughts whirled
through his head he wondered now that
he had it whether the gold stripe made
any difference gentleman-by act of
congress he laughed as he remembered
thinking that about samson well sam-
son was the oniy gold-striper lie had known
who rated that designation he thought to
himself

  at the base welcome news was being
circulated that the war was about to end
there was talk of an armistice to settle
the terms lund to his dismay found
himself ordered to report to the flagship
to receive his commission there with
five other men he stood at attention before
an imposing array of gold braid and heard
the admirals voice saying something about
bravery-efficiency-distinguished serv-
ice

  the words hazily penetrated his con-
sciousness his thoughts kept straying
across the atlantic to a familiar room
where a golden-haired girl had once told
him that she loved him he received an
official-looking document saluted sharply
and the ordeal was over he went
through the handclasping and congratula-
tions with embarrassed haste and was
glad to get back on the familiar decks of
the montana

  ensign lund was quickly put at his
ease in the officers quarters only sam-
son held coldly aloof which did not dis-
please lund when they met unavoidably
a matter of stripes



which was often there was a very formal
strained courtesy between them but this
was not for long

  the mont arm was ordered home follow-
ing closely upon news of the armistice
the days seemed interminable as they
steamed across the atlantic the ship
routine was doubly irksome with the dura-
tion-of-war men thinking only of home and
discharge

  lund was one of the first to file applica-
tion for discharge with captain wright
the old man tried to talk him into stay-
ing in the navy but lund had his mind
on other things he was thinking of betty
and a job that was waiting for him in an
engineering firm

  when they tied up at the dock lund

hurriedly signed the papers transferring
him to ensign in the naval reserves he
looked down at the gold stripe on his
sleeve and remembered his feelings months
before when he had looked at the four
faded-red ones that had been there

  betty was obviously glad to see him as
she threw her arms around his neck then
stood off and exclaimed at his officers
uniform dont take it seriously he
said i received my discharge and will
shed this as soon as i can get to a tailor

  im so sorry i like- betty started

but lund interrupted her

  what difference does it make now he
said its only a matter of stripes
what betty did then convinced him he
was right
qualities of command

 by frank h shaw

  peter murdoch in trying to outroar boreas vas having a bad
  time until captain lumley took hold and showed him a few
  things about leadership

eter murdoch opened his
eyes widely and his mouth as
well gazing at the stranger he
seemed too astonished for utter-
ance say it again mister he gasped
incredulously

   am the new captain-are you the mate
i was told would be aboard said the
slim grayish man whose face was more
that of a dreamer than a man of action

  be hanged to that for a yarn roared
murdoch-a big man with the lumbering
clumsiness of a bull about his movements
and gestures why-why-they as good
as told me i was to be captain

  the quiet dreamy newcomer took a
neat wallet from his breast pocket selected
therefrom a paper unfolded it and ten-
dered it he was very precise in his

movements as he was neat in his garb
mv credentials he mentioned

  murdoch ran his eye over the letter it
was on the paper of the firm that owned
the boanerges it said that captain mat-
thew lumley was authorized by the owners
to take over command of the ship from
mr peter murdoch and that mr peter
murdoch would grant all facilities to him

  well im-blistered snorted mur-
doch having digested the astonishing in-
formation

   hope we shall manage to pull to-
gether said captain lumley mildly but
murdochs eyes wavered none the less

  im not so sure that we shall fairs
fair the world over didnt i bring this
packet into port after captain mallinson
dropped dead on the bridge well i ask
qualities of command



you for two pins id sling my bag over
the side and let the blinking company go
hang

  then youd lose a good deal of seni-
ority observed lumley always mildly
and good berths arent going begging
ive noticed

 that was true enough since the
boanerges arrival in port murdoch had
been asked by no fewer than twenty-five
passed masters for a chance to sign on in
the forecastle-promising men too most
of them things maritime were in a shock-
ing condition every one admitted for a
man to throw up a -berth as first mate of
the boanerges-and the pay was good in
the company-was tantamount to com-
mitting professional suicide murdoch
hadnt put anything by for a rainy day
either he was the sort of man who blued
his pay day as soon as he got his fingers
on it

  see to getting my gear aboard please
said captain lumley as murdoch cast
about for a suitable reply ill take a look
at my cabin

  he mounted to the boat deck as one well
accustomed to a ship familiar with all its
intricate geography he opened the cap-
tains cabin door and entered murdoch
had established himself there the place
was in disorder a half-emptied whisky
bottle stood on the table cigar butts lit-
tered the floor the bed had not been
made up and dirty water stood in the
washbasin captain lumley sniffed opened
the scuttles to permit of fresh air entering
and sat down on the settee after heaving
murdochs shore-going clothes into the
disheveled bunk

  place is like a pigsty he criticized
and pressed the bell in the bulkhead
nothing happened he went to the door
and called steward in a remarkably
powerful voice for a man of his quiet ap-
pearance

  listen to him-already scoffed mur-
doch to the second mate new skipper-
looks like a parson shoved into my job
mark you-my job well if i do stick it
ill give him such a hell of a time he wont
know pay day from christmas morning
ive wrapped better men than him round
their own necks poisonous i call it

  its a bit thick right enough storm-
along the second mate agreed but not
too enthusiastically

  you saw what happened to old mal-

linson didnt you old dismal jimmy
didnt get much change out of me did he
just about broke his heart didnt i  well
this new chap had better not try any funny
work with me or his names misery 
bragged the mate of the boanerges go
and tell him the stewards ashore and
stop him shouting the dock down and
give him a hint if you like that if he
wants to feel comfortable he might just
as well go ashore and stop there because
ive got it in for him properly

  he looked as good as his threat-a giant
of a man a proper bucko hazer of a man
hed served his time as he was fond of
boasting in proper hard-case windjam-
mers where you backed your orders with
boot toe or belaying pin where you hit a
man first and if he looked ugly you hit
him again he was hairy to the knuckles
and his broken nose gave him an awe-
inspiring appearance his voice was in
keeping with his looks

  yes sir said the second mate who
something of a weakling found it expedi-
ent to kotow to mr murdoch yes sir
ill tell him he climbed the ladder and
walked hands in pockets to the captains
cabin

  wanting the steward he asked hes
ashore

  at this time of day for some rea-
son or other the second mates hands came
out of his pocket his shoulders straight-
ened yet captain lumley had not spoken
angrily merely casually-a bit surprised
the immediate thought that ran through
the seconds mind was murdoch
mightnt have the soft thing he fancies
hes going to have

  the mate told him he wasnt wanted
sir said stormalong can i do any-
thing

  i dont expect my officers to do stew-
ards work when the steward comes
aboard send him to me-at once

  aye aye sir shall i ask the chief
officer to send a man after the steward
sir stormalong had a view of the dis-
ordered cabin and the half-empty bottle
which he had not been asked to share

  time enough youre the second mate
i see try a shave before lunch time
thats all thank you the second mate
went away thoughtfully he had made no
attempt to hint to captain lumley that
murdoch was a man to be feared

  well grunted murdoch tell him


sea slories

  no sir-only that the steward was
ashore he seemed-peeved a bit
stormalong ran his hand over his scrubby
chin think ill have a shave he men-
tioned

  murdoch also felt his chin with a two-
day stubble on it heres one that isnt
going to suck up to a new man he
growled if he doesnt like me as i am
he can do the other thing i aim to break
his blinking heart before this trips over
and done with ive broken others-had
em eating out of my hand this chaps
easy you watch and youll see after
a moments swagger if he starts in ask-
ing for me tell him im lying down dyou
see

  very good sir

  wait a bit though mr murdoch
swaggered bullishly along to the captains
cabin tie leaned his vast shoulder against
the door jamb and breathed a flavor of
alcohol into the apartment

  i left a few of my things here he
gloomed thinking i was right for the
command

  the whiskys overboard if thats what
you waitf said the new captain

  mr murdoch was on the point of break-
ing out into open profanity but he checked
himself the ship was at present in port
articles had not yet been signed and it
was conceivably within the power of this
butter-backed lily-handed interloper to
make an unfavorable report on the pres-
ent personnel of the ship for the time
being until the boanerges was safely at
sea away from the interference of mis-
guided owners who didnt understand the
realities of ships and the men who used
them it might be advisable to walk warily
a f terward though-ah

  it wasnt the whisky murdoch said
shall i clear out my gear

  yes go ahead said captain lumley
unconcernedly and went on writing on the
pad he had apparently taken from his
neat attache case got my kit aboard
yet

  as it happened his baggage still stood
on the dock side where it had been dumped
from his cab

  im just seeing to it-sir said mur-
doch sheathing his iron fist in the velvet
glove of suavity short-handed though
you see

  he had not any intention of being apolo-
getic but somehow he was apologetic to

a dandy-fine psalm-singing interloper
only wait though a man didnt get a
proper chance of self-expression when his
ship was tied to a dock he blundered into
the cabin and collected his clothing pur-
posely making as much noise and commo-
tion as he could he was in many ways
like a big sulky schoolboy who had been
kept in against his will he felt lie would
like to break loose and throw things at the
indifferent intruder

  dont wreck the place said captain
lumley mildly and went on writing
murdoch felt that he would like to know
what the gist of his letter was-probably
a sneaking behind-the-back report to the
owners-a spys report he passed be-
hind the captain and tried to read the neat
script over his shoulder but lumley in-
terposed the swell of his body having no
desire to surrender his confidences to his
wife to alien eyes

  murdoch collected his belongings and
went out he found tne second mate had
got the captains baggage inboard and was
having it brought to the cabin

  sucking up to him--already he
sneered lie went to his own old room
that he had thought never to use again
and there he shaved and changed and
afterward went ashore-first bellowing
curses at the watchman in that the gang-
way ladder had been allowed to slip by
the tides action his was an overpower-
ing voice that echoed along the decks im-
pressively-and he purposely made it even
louder than normal so that the new cap-
tain should realize the caliber of the man
he had ousted from command framed in
his own doorway lumley watched him roll
up the wharf-a mighty man he shook
his head thoughtfully before he resumed
his writing

  murdoch after refreshments which he
felt he needed went to a place he knew of
and asked what prospects there were of a
well-recommended man getting a command
in a different line

  well i dont know said his friend
but between you and me you could walk
on the heads of waiting skippers from here
to yonder and not find it difficult i f you
have a job stick to it-any job

 but murdoch wasnt impressed-he
wasnt an ordinary candidate he made
the round of the offices-and found the
story to be everywhere the same no

sea-
qualities of command



berths long waiting lists fate was deal-
ing him a wicked hand 

  there remained nothing but the boa-
nerges and subordination-of a sort but
with liquor lees working within him he
rewened his vow to give the interloper
one devil of a time

  as a consequence lie was on the boa-
nerges forecastle head when that resolute
freighter put out to sea and all the local
world knew that mr peter murdoch was
showing it what a proper casehardened
rip-snorter of a mate the ship had his
voice cursing the sluggard crew volleyed
enormously it threatened to raise blisters
on the paint he was showing off shame-
lessly-impressing mild-mannered captain
lumley with the real caliber of the man
hed been appointed to command he
fell upon one bemused deck hand like a
tornado and booted him off the forecastle
for some dilatoriness followed him
chased him along the well deck in advance
of showered blows then he went up to
the bridge vaingloriously walking on his
heels

  thats the way i sober a crowd up
he bragged

  a bit noisy i thought when all is said
and done seamen arent cattle

  this sort are-gutter sweepings  but
 know my job and i dont want any man
to try to teach it to me why ive seen
the time- pie vaunted his past reck-
lessnesses-citing that time when a ship
in which he served had picked up a half-
breed crew in some remote western port-
mutineers and cutthroats to a man but
hed tamed them-oh yes

  so that no man dared to lift his voice
above a whisper if i was anywhere about
he explained im mate as it happens
and i know a mates job backward-and
wont thank any one to interfere with me

  i believe in leaving my officers to run
their own jobs said captain lumley so
long as they are efficient youll attend to
the stowing of everything of course since
we look like running into dirt

  im just going to see to it-and you
can rely  it that when ive handled the
proposition itll be done mr murdoch
stalked magnificently from the bridge and
meeting the second mate coming from aft
told him that hed put a proper spoke in the
old mans wheel now that he was clear
of the land he was brewing up for the big-

 sea-

gest sort of big trouble but he was effi-
cient-even the shrewdest critic might not
deny that fact-as a ships husband he left
nothing to be desired by the time night
fell the boanerges was stripped and
groomed in readiness to face anything the
sea might be prepared to send murdoch
went to the bridge to report this fact and
found the second mate in charge although
there was much inward shipping making
up on the tide and navigation was intri-
cate now dismal jimmy had never al-
lowed a subordinate to handle the ship in
close waters being the sort of a man who
was reluctant to delegate authority

  his nibs in the chart room asked
murdoch

  down below in his own cabin sir

  oh is he the second mate altered
course to pass an approaching schooner

  he said that as i was a qualified navi-
gator it was my job to navigate the
junior was in a state of nervous excite-
ment lacking confidence and by gosh
mister its keeping me guessing to sheer
clear of everything thats coming along
but when i sang out to him a bit since he
asked me what i was up here for and
between ourselves its doing me good
already

  murdoch swung him roughly about by
his shoulder bending to stare into his face

  remember this he growled before
this trips ended captain lumley will be
coming to heel like a pup im the
man youve got to keep in with if you want
to be happy all right you can go below
to supper ill take hold here and
pacing the wind-swept bridge he pon-
dered over adequate plans for the proper
disciplining of the usurper whom he was
growing to hate with the utmost cordiality

  it was evilly cold and the wind was
cresting with a ragged sleet the whine
of storm was in the air occasional wafts
of spindrift rattled over the freighters
bridge the man at the wheel was steer-
ing like a gardener too-taking the whole
channel and keeping the watch officer con-
stantly on the alert murdochs ill humor
increased but for this newcomer he
might have been snugged up in the cabin
with a stove going full blast and a glass of
hot toddy at his elbow with nothing else
to do but make himself comfortable in-
stead of that he had to trudge mount
misery-cold disgruntled and dissatisfied

  ill properly break his blasted heart for


sea stories

this he threatened and he was so busy
nursing his woes that he failed to notice
the near approach of a sleet-blinded
steamer until it was almost too late then
he altered helm rapidly and bellowed a tor-
rent of abuse into the swirling gloom he
even rang the engines to stop so close a
call was it-and he was finding fresh pro-
fanity when captain lumley lightly
reached the bridge beside him

  sensing trouble the new captain had not
waited-he had slid out alertly without
waterproof protection and murdochs
first thought was a chuckling one the old
man would get a wet skin

  whats wrong asked lumley grasp-
ing the position at once

  fellow blundered right across my
hawse curse him thundered murdoch
and sent another waft of bad language into
the darkness

  he has the right of way hasnt he
straighten the ship up-stop that cursing
you admit yourself in the wrong by it

  murdoch felt murderous the man at the
wheel whom he just bawled out for a
clumsy farmer must have heard that crisp
rebuke with difficulty he refrained from
laying a violent hand on the captains per-
son as it was he shook a fist toward him

  now look you here he grated when
im keeping watch here i dont want any
interference from any one-not from any
one

  keep your watch properly and you
wont be interfered with said lumley

  ive been watch keeping a good while
now-

  then you ought to know when to give
way and that ship was in the right of it

  murdoch would have liked to ram that
accusation down lumleys throat but after
a quick glance about the captain retired

  not a minute too soon either rasped
murdoch for the benefit of the helmsman
ill teach him to come butting in here
where he isnt wanted you mind your
helm you son of a farmer whats that
want me to put a head on you do you 

  i was ony saying the ships got no
steerage way now her engines are stopped
grumbled the man at the wheel and mur-
doch put the matter right with smothered
curses

  there are many ways in which the mate
can make life unpleasant for a master
-and as the time went by murdoch put
them all into practice invariably his man-

ner was hectoring and arrogant-he
plainly showed that he resented interfer-
ence he was prone to boast of how he
had carried things after dismal jimmy
died-with hinted sneers at captain lum-
ley s less efficient methods before four
days were over he flattered himself that
hed put lumley in his place-the old
man never lifted his voice above a whisper
now in fact he seldom showed his nose
on deck-contenting himself with his own
cabin or with exercise to leeward of the
boat deck beyond doing the necessary
navigation he did not interfere murdoch
wished he would poke his nose into his
job sometimes-so that he could snub him
more frequently but how could you bull-
doze a man who gave you no single peg
to hang an argument on the new fel-
low was too easy he had weakened al-
ready he was a comfort lover too for
the atlantic weather was steadily and evilly
growing worse and his snug cabin invited
him much more than did the bleak un-
easy bridge so far as the indications
went the boanerges was in for a proper
dusting farther west-passing ships sig-
naled the worst sort of weather but
lumley gave the matter no heed he
merely asked mildly if the mate had at-
tended to such and such details of safety

  course i have think i dont know my
job barked murdoch whats a bit of
bad weather to be scared of id like to
know 

  its probably going to be more than a
bit take every precaution please

  that same night at supper giptain
lumley complained of indisposition and
murdoch winked covertly at the steward

  touch of cape horn fever he in-
quired rudely

  youre forgetting yourself arent you
i occasionally have these bad bouts it
will pass off i hope before we run into
the proper heavy stuff 

  well its blowing above a bit now-
has been all my watch on top said mur-
doch you wouldnt know of course
snugged up below

  im going to turn in dont disturb me
except in case of extreme necessity the
captain said

  murdoch had a proper grumble for the
second when he relieved him on top

  lord knows what the lines coming to
he triumphed theyve shipped us a
proper soldier as skipper hes got a bad
qualities of command



cold-caught it from his feet he gets the
comfort and the extra pay and weve got
to do the work well there isnt anything
would please me better than to sew a few
firebars up with him and dump him over-
side-then all hells bells couldnt keep me
out of the command

  the second mate went below for his own
supper and mr murdoch stalked the ex-
posed bridge like a conqueror he con-
sidered the howling prospect-the white-
lipped rage of the storm-lashed atlantic
the mighty power of the hurtling wind
that had ice in its breath a little twinge
of what might have been loneliness
troubled him-he felt himself to be less
invincible than he had supposed it was
all wrong of the skipper to back out of
the fight just when it promised to be most
sensational hang it all what was a
skipper for but to accept responsibility
it wasnt right to give a man mates pay
and rank and expect him to run the ship
all on his own mr murdoch stepped into
the chart room and studied the barometer
and what he saw lengthened his face he
summoned the boatswain and then bade
him chase the crew around the water-
logged decks and spread fresh tarpaulins
over the hatches he roared out his or-
ders raucously finding a queer but not alto-
gether satisfying companionship in the
clamor of his own voice-like a boy whis-
tling as he runs down a dark country lane
at eight bells he went to the captains
room

  its blowing up nastily he said

  yes very well i expected it i asked
not to be disturbed though

  thought id better tell you-its going
to blow big to-night

  quite so but tell the second mate not
to disturb me-keep an eye open yourself
youve had command so youll know
whats wanted

  but mr murdoch had not had com-
mand in such weather as now threatened
after dismal jimmy died the boanerges
had run into calms and variables that
caused  trouble

  meaning to say you want me to act
as skipper lie demanded you lying
snugged up here

  i dont feel fit to turn out said lum-
ley murdoch went away growling bit-
terly it was a bit too thick-leaving him
with the dog to hold once again a great
loneliness troubled the mate it troubled

him so much that sleep deserted his eyelids
when he turned in he wondered if the
second mate could handle the situation
hang it it was the old mans affair
anyhow-he was skipper wasnt he but
the old man had quite definitely said that
he had temporarily abdicated-there was
no getting away from that mr murdoch
relieved the bridge before his time and
stormalong was gusty in gratitude at the
sight of him

   its been a devils delight of a watch
he complained

  its going to be worse said murdoch
seen anything of the old man

  not a blink hes hogging it below
and when i spoke down the tube he said he
was feeling too ill to bother

  damned shirker growled murdoch
and began to tell stormalong a tedious
story about some big adventure in which
he had figured as dashing hero it was a
story the second mate had heard often be-
fore  but murdoch wanted companionship
some one to whom to refer in case of
doubt even the second was better than the
stark loneliness of responsibility

  well sir ill get below glad to get
out of it chattered stormalong literally
dragging himself free of murdochs grasp
murdoch took his post the boanerges
was battling gamely against increasing
forces the night was infernally black
and threatening the seas were running to
the height of the funnel and the sprays
were incessant whole water tumbled
aboard at every scend of the laboring hull

  shell wash herself down before day-
light thought murdoch he blew down
the speaking tube after a while

   getting pretty bad up here sir he re-
ported

  there was a long weary yawn from
captain lumley very well he said

but im not well enough-

  the whistle was plugged back into the
tube the boanerges seemed determined
to show just what she could do in the way
of making a hog of herself a boarding
sea smashed a lifeboat into matchwood
against the funnel casing the smashing
sounded as if the entire ship was break-
ing into its elements sea after sea boarded
her with pitiless regularity and occasion-
ally the big water made a clean sweep of
the bridge where murdoch crouched
something began to weaken within him as
he felt the unending drive of the storm


sea stories

he wasnt quite sure what he needed-a
bit of a drink be thought to banish the
sense of remote loneliness that troubled
him or companionship-that was it
some one to consult with some ones
counsel to add to his own but that her-
ring-gutted skipper-the dandy-fine wash-
out whod done him out of his lawful com-
mand-you couldnt get any help from
him

  he began to curse lumley viciously and
venomously for a deserter in the face of
the enemy oh yes a proper quitter a
man whod let go his hold of things at a
time of crisis like this wasnt in any sense
a man

  the wind gathered itself together into
one frenzied squall and hurled down on
the staggering boanerges it lifted a wall
of water high up to windward of the
harassed hull a wall that grew and towered
and swung menacingly the ship heeled
over and over going sickeningly the dull
thumping of her engines seemed to lessen
and cease

  if anything happens in the engine room
were scuppered  thought murdoch the
ship heeled farther farther still until
half her lee deck seemed to be under solid
water there was a sense of taut strain
about her

  somethings got to go groaned mur-
doch she cant stand this but she
stood it and recovered and a fresh squall
quickened and bore down on her blow
after blow slogged at the squirming fabric
in a pitiless succession of malignant fury
the few deck hands of the watch came
staggering up to the bridge hungry for
companionship in this hour of terror
they recognizing their own helplessness
craved the assurance of a better entity
than themselves

  murdoch torn off his feet by a falling
wave recovered and dragged himself to
the speaking tube again

  come on up here and do something
he stormed

  you cannot handle her came the
tired voice from below

  shes breaking herself up-i cant do
a thing what do you think youre at
hiding down there below 

  very well as he replaced the plug
murdoch wished hed hung on a bit longer
surely he was as big as this shirker down
below hadnt he been a fool to ask for
help but then it wasnt an ordinary

gale this-it was something bisrger than
hed ever seen in all his experience-as
though the atlantic was intent on humili-
ating him and captain lumley did not
appear the hellish hurricane was increas-
ing in violence with every passing minute
but still lumley cowered in hiding below
he was probably drinking himself into a
stupor murdoch thought scared to
tackle the increasing problems

  for two pins id go down and yank him
out by the scalp he gloomed wrath-
ful ly

  time dragged by every minute the
boanerges seemed  the verge of com-
pleted dissolution but as often she mirac-
ulously recovered and slugged on hitting
into the massed waves recoiling a little
gathering her strength for further attack
but peter murdoch had no eyes for the
splendor of the struggle-he was quaking
to the core of his soul raving at the
deck hands for a pack of lubberly louts
didnt do any real good-though it eased
his feelings momentarily the cold appre-
hension was back again the instant his
great voice died down a man needed
something more than bluff and bounce in
a crisis the whistle in the engine-room
speaking tube fizzed and cheeped when
murdoch got to it it said well need
to ease her down a bit here below in a

clydeside voice heated bearings-

it was all vague the words almost inaudi-
ble because of the roar of machinery and
the hiss of steam

  you cant stormed murdoch

   shell do it hersel if we dont
murdoch raved incoherencies into the
tube blasting the eyes of all below for a
pack of dissolute mechanics who didnt un-
derstand their jobs

  i give ye warning the words came
back were easing her down 

  something vital appeared to leave the
boanerges almost  the word she be-
came inert and sluggish and the force of
wind and water increased half a dozen
towering combers swept her clean-the
bridge shook and chattered

  watch your helm blurted murdoch
dont let her fall off

  helms hard down sir yelped the
helmsman and then mr peter murdoch
cut loose completely his hands flung
high above his head he raved up and
down the slanted bridge like a maniac
calling on heaven to witness that hed
qualities of command



done his uttermost it wasnt fair-it
wasnt fair to saddle a man with all this
responsibility with a blasted loafer that
called himself a captain malingering down
below

  charging across the bridge he cannoned
into a figure just arriving get down be-
low and tell the captain-ask him to come
up here

  anything wrong asked lumley
quietly in hard-weather clothing he was
calm and collected entirely unperturbed
there was a little ring in his voice though
that seemed to hint at steel somewhere
about the neighborhood of his soul

  thank heaven gulped murdoch
clawing at the captains shoulders shes

scuppered-

  hardly that is she immediately a
great and new confidence possessed peter
murdoch it was tinged with a smarting
sense of shame his rioting imagination
had conceivably magnified the dangers
hed been a fool to weaken

  shes about as bad as she can be he
said anxious now to make as good a show-
ing as possible in sight of the man he had
despised things are busted up below

and this gales hardening-

  well asked captain lumley step-
ping to the wheel thence to the rail glanc-
ing overside collecting his forces for battle
as it were well what do you propose
to do

  its up to you now-sir

  ah but if id been dangerously ill
however well do what we can cap-
tain lumley grasped the situation quickly
without asking questions and as though
his mere presence there had imbued the
ship with a new fighting spirit the boa-
nerges immediately seemed to grow easier
in her horrid plungings

  youll stand by to rig a sea anchor
mister in case of emergency the der-
ricks off the foremast eh  rouse out all
hands and the cook we maynt need it
but its as well to be ready

  he got himself to the engine-room tube
and busied himself there his voice crisp
and purposeful-that of a commander ex-
pecting the impossible an unwilling ad-
miration for the quiet man began to grow
in the heart of peter murdoch he felt
as if he loved him captain lumley
emanated a quality that inspired a man and
quelled his apprehensions murdoch felt
that left to it now he would know pre-

cisely what to do in every detail it was
only the feeling that what lie did he was
committed to with  court of appeal that
had unnerved him before

  i was a thundering fool he berated
himself and tried to hate his superior but
failed

  we may not need that sea anchor but
get the gear ready the trouble down be-
low is being righted

  you feeling better sir seems a shame
to rouse you out you not feeling well too 

  ill manage the inward glow of
self-confidence pleased peter murdoch
assured him that he was a better man
than he had realized himself to be in the
moment of panic then common fairness
came-he knew that it wasnt his own
courage at all it was the calm assurance
of captain lumley

  if you think youd be better belowr
sir-

  ill stay up here and see her through
ah thats the engine room murdoch
took the message-full power was again
available yet it somehow didnt seem to
matter now the ship was in safe hands
the situation was infinitely less desperate
than it had been yet the storm was in-
creasing in roaring squalls too the outer
rigors were worse than they had been

  a full-powered ship like this oughtnt
to be bothered by a bit of a breeze said
lumley when you have confidence in
your ship and yourself nothing can be
bad enough to smash you if you feel con-
fident to handle her though ill go below
now-

  yes sir you go-take care of your-
self said peter murdoch captain lum-
ley took a new view of the position  and
then without issuing a single order he
scrambled below

  just let me know if you need me again
he said with a hint of a laugh in his
voice

  ship can damn well break her back be-
fore i ask for him again said murdoch
when left alone but the feeling was pres-
ent that lumley was there in case of des-
perate need that reluctant admiration
for the little man became more voluntary
dash it there was something more in
command than mere braggadocio and blus-
ter-something that peter murdoch began
to feel vague sirring within him calm-
ness self-reliance-and even something
else to which he could give no name


sea stories

the power of inspiring those beneath to do
their damnedest eh something of that
sort peter murdoch felt just then as
though he would give ten years of his
life to earn captain lumleys esteem a
little gray runt like that too-a man he
could pick up with one hand and break as
easily as a pipestem queer and he
would like stormalong the second mate
to feel toward him peter murdoch as he
felt toward captain lumley

  watching the boanerges still battling
stolidly peter murdoch shook his fist at
the raging seas

  go on get at it-do your damndest
he said you wont force me to rouse
that poor beggar out again-he deserves
his rest

  and clear through the inferno of the
night he remained in control overcoming
by gradual degrees the panicky desire to
summon lumley into consultation hour
by hour peter murdoch found himself and
the unbeatable spirit within him so that
when the livid dawn broke to show the
real horrors that the merciful darkness had
hidden it found him weary and gaunt but
-defiant for a moment he left storm-
along in charge and slipped down to lum-
leys cabin

  lumley fully clad was sitting on his
settee and for one moment murdoch

glimpsed a tense something in his face that
astounded him captain lumley was
afraid-scared to the core of his soul
but the expression of fear gave place to
a smile as he looked at the figure of his
mate

  hope youre feeling better sir said
murdoch ships doing all right if you
feel youd like to turn in i fancy i can
handle her captain lumley held out his
hand

  good man he said theres noth-
ing the matter with me-though its not
been easy to stick it here and-well give
you your chance shall we say im glad
you didnt send for me though murdoch
-dashed glad youve got qualities the
owners sent me aboard to size you up try
you out im not here as a permanency
at all-just for this passage ill leave at
st johns-and ill advice the owners to
let you have the ship now its not all beer
and skittles in command eh but the
biggest thing about it so far as i can
see is never to let those under you know
you are scared no matter how scared you
might be thats command-and i think
youve got it now turn in-ill take
hold

  if you dont mind sir said peter
murdoch humbly ill stick it out a bit
longer

he big slab feet of squirt
mcduff first-class quartermaster
protruded far into the passage-
way leading to the forecastle he
was having a lovely afternoon digesting
one of uncle sams navy meals and enjoy-
ing an after-dinner siesta at the same time
not many men would have selected such
an exposed spot on account of liability to
disturbance but squirts prestige assured
safety from interference alongside the
newspaper on which he slept was his ever-
present spit kid for squirt had come by
his pseudonym from the enormous quanti-
ties of chewing tobacco he consumed

  some day that guys goin to get his
slats caved in if he dont get some other
place to cork off growled wilson cap-
tain of that part of the ship his audi-
ence seated or sprawling about the spot-
less deck agreed to a man but who there
would take issue with the husky quarter-
master

  micky hill junior coxswain from the
third division was seated on the beading
alongside a newcomer an ordinary seaman

just out by last army transport from the
states micky was explaining to young
grace the intricacies of ship routine 
the asiatic station when wilson came
grumbling by

  well why dont you tell him about it
micky asked of wilson youre captain
of this part of the ship aintcha

  why dont you retorted wilson sar-
castically

  because this aint my part of the ship
bet he wouldnt get away with that kind o
stuff back in the third division hes got
all you stiffs up here buffaloed thats
whats the matter youre scared of him
why dont you take him back to the of-
ficer of the deck if he gets mouthy you
dont have to take any guff from that guy
at all

  just then waddings the ships jester
came along and paused a moment to ob-
serve the inert form of squirt before step-
ping over him waddings was the ships
bugler and it is said on board men-of-
war that in order to pass an examination
for the rating of bugler one must be half


sea stories

baked or have been struck on the bead
while at a tender age

  waddings gazed around like a good
general closely observing the field before
making his attack in three quick jumps
it would be possible to reach the ladder
leading below and waddings held no
doubts as to his jumping ability taking
from his pocket a clip of cigarette papers
he carefully folded one down the middle
and inserted it between the snoring quar-
termasters right great toe and its neighbor
the great red toe its nail discolored from
paint or lye wiggled slightly but the paper
remained where wad had put it there
was an appreciative though fearful group
of spectators wilson started forward to
restrain the crazy bugler but fearing that
squirt might awaken and think him the
perpetrator held back open-mouthed

  micky and gracc seated on the bead-
ing watched proceedings with the sharp-
est interest micky knew what was com-
ing but his companion new to forecastles
could only wait and observe squirts full
round paunch rose and fell in blissful con-
tentment on his face unaccustomed as
it was to smiles one might have thought
a half grin lingered waddings struck a
match cautiously and made ready to spring
the match sputtered and gave a tiny flame
which was touched to the paper instantly
waddings decamped in the first instant
of genial heat squirts toes expanded ap-
preciatively but for an instant only in a
flash the flame shot along the rim of paper
and up between the toes with a wild
whoop the sleeper sprang into the air his
feet executing half a dozen complete
revolutions before striking the deck in
his half sleep he kicked out strenuously
as if he would remove the terrible burning
but succeeded only in wreaking damage to
a starboard heavy ventilator it rang from
the impact of squirts foot but refused
to budge an inch

  it would have been most interesting
could the feelings of the onlookers as por-
trayed on their faces have been preserved
at that moment on some was written
horror  others suppressed amusement
and on a few amusement unsuppressed
one of the last was grace the momentary
companion of micky

  you dirty bunch of yellow curs
shouted squirt i can whip any four
of you the man who did that is a dirty
sneak and a coward i can lick him with

one hand tied behind my back heres
twenty pesos to anybody wholl tell me who
did that ill find out some way and be-
lieve me when i do ill murder some-
body

  squirt rolled up his paper stuck it under
his arm and was reaching for his spit kid
when he observed the open smile on the
face of the newr ordinary seaman gracc

  finding it pretty funny aint you
kid squirt dropped his implements and
came over in front of the two you bet-
ter wipe that grin off your mush or i will
maybe you can tell me who pulled the
stunt supposin you do come on up
here stand up

  squirt reached down and grasping
grace by the collar jerked the boy to his
feet it would have been extremely dif-
ficult to find two types so exactly opposite
the quartermaster with heavy arms and
thick wrists a puffed and angered face
whose stocky shoulders would have made
two men such as grace loomed heavy and
threatening like a battleship the ordinary
seaman on the other hand was not ex-
actly slight of build but well-balanced
his smooth boyish face rather small was
animated by the clearest of blue eyes his
arms and shoulders suggested the litheness
of the panther with apparently the least
exertion gracc twisted one arm and cleared
himself of squirts grip then reseated him-
self alongside micky

  hey you did ya get me you tell
me who flashed that cigarette paper or
ill smack you down you cant smirk at
me like a grinning ape and get away with it
just tell me who the guy was and ill let

von alone but if you dont-- squirt

looked at his closed fist suggestively

  it amused me all right to see you do
the war dance remarked grace quietly
or was it the highland fling but as
for telling who did it i couldnt if t would
as im a new man on the ship and they
all look alike to me but furthermore i
wouldnt tell you if i could

  one could almost hear the gasps along
the listening forecastle not that there
were not a great many men there who
wouldnt have fought squirt upon provo-
cation but fighting when one has to and
seeking a fight are vastly different

  well since you wont get up and fight
take it from me the first time i catch you
on the beach im going to flop you and
flop you hard you better go ashore with
land tactics



some good shipmate every time so he can
carry you back for im going to grind you
in the mud whats your name 
your threats dont worry me in the
least old man so run along now get next
to yourself i havent looked for any
trouble with you nor do  want any but
if it is your wish you may find me on
the beach any time my name is on the
liberty list and just why you should
want to know my name is a puzzle to me
but i dont mind telling it my name is
grace

  grace repeated squirt with a sneer
that was greeted by numerous titters from
the sailors grace what

  arthur grace at your service sir
mocked the newcomer

  at that moment the officer of the deck
on one of his hourly inspections strolled
easily along the forecastle threading his
way among the groups of men

  remember kid threatened squirt
making ready to leave on the beach
grace by this time was in earnest con-
versation with micky and did not deign
to give squirt a single glance his con-
temptuous manner was more than the lat-
ter could put up with and he took a step
toward the two but observing the officer
of the deck he turned and hastily made
his way to the flying bridge where he could
resume his nap

  instantly grace was the center of an
admiring group for not a man but enjoyed
his taking squirt down the line and they
were eager to show their homage

  you shouldnt have butted into it
kid advised micky thats a mean guy
and a dirty fighter hell mop up on you
some time or other you better put in
for a transfer to some other ship
you bet i wouldnt want that guy on
my trail admonished one of the group
remember how he sent young rolfe to
the hospital he wont pick a fight with
anybody he cant lick

  and he fights with elbows and thumbs
and you better watch him-hell knee you
advised a third

  i dont say as how he cant be licked
remarked another but the guys got to
be good i sure do hope you can beat up
on him young fellow dont fight him
unless some of the other boys are around
for hes strong as a bull and if he gets
his hands on you it will lie the deep six
for you j ust see there are some other guys

around and theyll make him fight fair
but you got a hard man to whip if you
intend to fight i sure would hate to have
him tackle me but i think hes yellow as
a cur once he finds a man can stand up
against him boy id give twenty plunks
to see you hammer hell out o him

  oh i suppose hell whip me all right
hell weigh forty pounds more than i
will but while hes getting a full meal ill
be getting a sandwich and weight doesnt
mean everything it isnt always the size
of a ship that makes you seasick im
not much of a scrapper but a darn sight
better at that than i am at running so if
he forces me into it ill give him every-
thing i got in the shop hes sure got a
powerful grip in that right nearly shut
off my wind there for a minute

  almost instantly arthur grace leaped
into popularity and he was pointed out
from stem to stern as the man squirt was
going to get but he moved among his
shipmates wholly unconcerned at the fu-
rore he had created his work and
squirts -being so different they seldom
met but when they did there was no quail-
ing on the part of the smaller man once
when grace was returning from liberty
squirt was the quartermaster on watch and
had to check grace in the liberty book

  good thing i didnt know you went
over last night the quartermaster
growled his head bent low over the book
so the officer of the deck couldnt hear
what was being said

  did you expect me to come around and
report to you that i was going as in-
solently retorted art

ne sunday morning the chinese
wardroom boy came forward looking
for grace mr sheldon wanted to
see him in his room mr sheldon was
the ships athletic officer

  good morning the officer greeted
grace as he closed the door behind his
visitor whats this i hear about you
and mcduff the quartermaster

  why nothing sir replied grace
warily

  they tell me he intends to meet you
on the beach and have it out with you
now if that is so i thought i might pos-
sibly be of some assistance to you i
know youve got grit or you wouldnt have
talked up to him and you could be trained
so as to be able to take care of yourself


sea stories

if you had to he would probably whip
you but with training he wouldnt be able
to do so good a job of it and since ive
had considerable experience in boxing-i
used to be junior instructor at the academy
-i thought  might be able to help you
we could go down in the after store-
room every day for a little while and i
might be able to teach you some tricks

  i thank you very much lieutenant but
i believe ill tackle him with what ive
got somehow if youll excuse me sir
it wouldnt seem quite fair for me to train
under cover and then fight him i do
want you to know how much  appreciate
your offer however

  oh thats all right grace you
know this fellow mcduffs got the name of
being a hard guy and i thought id give
you a hand if i could mcduffs quite a
bully and has had a number of fights on
board ship he usually picks smaller men
than himself so everybody wants to see
him get trounced if you can do it more
power to you

ust as the one oclock liberty boat
was about to shove off the following
wednesday afternoon grace came
running down the gangway and boarded
the small craft with an envelope in his
hand and a duty belt on he took his
place in the stern and for a moment did
not notice that directly opposite him sat
the leering squirt but when he did how-
ever he returned that gentlemans steady
gaze with a direct stare fully as insolent
as any squirt was able to manufacture
the tiny craft bobbed up and down along-
side the gangway waiting for the order
to shove off finally there sounded the
glang-glang of the ships bell and the of-
ficer of the deck leaning over the rail
called

  shove off coxswain make your regu-
lar trip to the magallanes landing wait
there for the executive officers messenger
then return to the ship shove off

  on the way to the beach squirt tried to
glare grace down but the latter paid not
the slightest attention to him at the dock
squirt was ashore among the first and
stood waiting until grace stepped out of
the boat

  for ten cents id tear that belt off you
and give you a couple of others that would
do you more good taunted squirt keep-
ing up with art who hurried along the

wall leading up from the landing be-
lieve me i can hardly wait for the time
until i can sock you a couple ill get you
some time kiddo dont you worry you
cant always come ashore under a belt

  he grasped one of graces shoulders
and gave it a heavy twist that made the
seaman involuntarily wince a movement
not entirely lost on some of the men fol-
lowing the pair chief boatswains mate
gunthorpe an old-timer in the service
came running up and stepped in front of
squirt

  you yellow cur you leave that boy
alone or ill split your nose for you he
thundered

  what you got to say about it i aint
said nothing to you you looking for
trouble just take that coat off you
know i cant bust a chief

  gunthorpes action was quicker than ex-
pected

  lay there coat he commanded
now come on you four-flusher you dirty
kid fighter youve been bothering this
boy ever since he came to the ship if
you want to fight you dont have to look
any farther come  dont be back-
ward

  you travel on and mind your own
business whined squirt nobody said
anything to you-youre butting in i got
no reason to fight you

  well ill give you one snapped gun-
thorpe as he swung a heavy crash to the
quartermasters left eye

  all right chief you got the advan-
tage of me i dont want to fight you i
know id get the worst of it even if i
licked you youre a pretty wise chief all
right

  by this time other liberty boats were ar-
riving with officers arid their wives and
the combat party had to break up

  any time you want any more look me
up announced the chief petty officer as
he dusted off his white coat then put it
on

  you stick in your class and ill stick
to mine replied squirt i aint goin to
get in no jack pot if i know anything
about it if i slammed you one some
officer would see it and down id go for
a shot-then general court no sir im
not that easy

  youre in your class all right when you
pick trouble with a kid aint ya well
if you want satisfaction ill meet you any
land tactics



place you say any time any condition-
boxing gloves bare fists or anything you
want alls the matter with you is youre
yellow and you know it youre a brave
indian when it comes to smacking kids
but now you got the chance to buckle into
a man lets go over to louies back
room where we can have this thing out
during all this argument they continued
walking up the wall and had come now to
the old bridge of spain over the pasig

  where are you goin boy gunthorpe
asked

  to deliver a message to general allen
at the club

  if you think this fellowll bother you
ill go along

  no need of that sneered squirt
hes got a belt on and you got a chief
petty officers coat

  you want to fight awful bad dont
you you miserable skunk didnt i tell
you ill take off my coat and everything
else if youll only fight

  seeing the uselessness of further argu-
ment gunthorpe strolled away when
grace boarded a carromata on his way to
the club looking back the chief ob-
served squirt rubbing his left eye which
had gradually been taking on a purple hue

  bad news travels fast when grace re-
turned to the ship he reported to lieu-
tenant sheldon he had delivered the mes-
sage

  i understand you had some inter-
ference on the way over questioned the
officer

  no sir i dont think so

  it has been reported to me that mcduff
accosted you and delayed you just after
you reached the landing

  why he did walk alongside and we
talked but he didnt interfere sir

  all right thats all

ext morning when the liberty
party returned there was a message
for chief boatswains mate gun-
thorpe to report to lieutenant sheldon

  chief tell me what happened at the
landing yesterday afternoon between you
mcduff and grace

  there was nothing much sir mc-
duff has been threatening the boy for
some time and he was arguing with grace
going up the sea wall until i got tired of
it and told mcduff if he wanted to fight
he could accommodate me he said he

couldnt fight me because i was a chief
so i threw off my coat and poked him one
in the eye but he wouldnt fight

  if i thought he had interfered with
grace id court-martial him but grace
denies it-though i think lies just pro-
tecting mcduff do you think it would
help matters any if i ordered him to leave
grace alone

  no sir i dont the boys able to
care for himself and there are a bunch on
board who wont see any harm come to
him he isnt a bit afraid of mcduff sir
so theres no intimidation

  the next two weeks the armored cruiser
spent  the target range out in the middle
of manila bay and as the expanse of
water is approximately twenty miles long
and thirty wide it is obvious that there
could be no liberty boats while the ship
was engaged in that duty however
there were many diversified forms of en-
tertainment such as moving pictures
wrestling boxing and various other feats
of skill or strength

  during one evenings performance
squirt donned the gloves and gave a ter-
rific beating to a second-division man who
steadfastly refused to leave the ring until
finally ordered to do so by the athletic
officer squirt when the ring was cleared
invited any other man on board to take
him on for another bout but no one ac-
cepted the challenge from the depths of
the crowd sundry and various catcalls and
hla-ahs resembling guttural voicing of old
bellwethers greeted squirts bombast
wads bugle added to the occasion most
fitly when silence came it found squirt
not one whit disturbed

  any you blah-blahs out there want to
step up i dont bar any of you id
particularly like to take on that fresh guy
just out from the states are you in the
crowd mister grace

  general pandemonium followed there
was much jovialty from among the audi-
ence  why dont you bar high and take
only grammar-school kids bar every-
thing over a hundred and twenty dont
ya go get em old cradle snateher
then things began to fly first it was
a glove that was thrown alls of wadded
paper followed but before squirt got out
of the ring missiles had grown to deck
scrubbers while from the spud lockers de-
scended a regular barrage of potatoes and
onions squirt was the hit of the evening


almost every one registered once and
some of those nearer the ring more than
once he was however defiant and de-
fying when he entered the washroom dar-
ing any and all to accept his challenge

  what do you think of squirt now
micky inquired of grace next morning
as they drank their early coffee before turn-
ing to some bruiser eh

  oh yes he was too much for the man
they put in against him he carries a
powerful right if one choses to take a
ride on it but you can see it before he
starts it just as if he tied a starboard light
on his right hand and yelled look out
for the cars 

  well if he corners you just be care-
ful it isnt a sleeping car for you

  dont you worry about me so much
mick cautioned grace cheerily hon-
estly youd think i was actually in need
of protection the way some of you fellows
talk it doesnt worry me what if we
do get together either he licks me or
gets licked and what does it matter either
way it will probably be a good fight
pm not losing any sleep and im not
running in either direction

luhrifter the hawaii returned from the
target range pay day had intervened

- and the sailors were clamorous

with money aching to be put in circula-
tion grace and squirt among the lot

  it was a matter of coincidence that dur-
ing the months since the affair on the
forecastle neither of the principals had
met on the beach certainly grace had
gone on liberty whenever he had the
money pie did not avoid meeting his
burly menace but chance had kept them
apart then like a lone lamb coming to
slaughter the morning after their first
liberty following target practice grace
strolled easily down the broad street lead-
ing to the dock a few sailors were
grouped at the landing waiting for the
liberty boat the hawk eyes of squirt
sighted grace far up the broad thorough-
fare and all the pent-up anger of months
blazed in his small greenish-gray eyes
abruptly he turned on his heel and strode
in the direction of his approaching victim
they met opposite an open space ordi-
narily used for parking buffalo carts

  well kid  guess ive caught up with
you at last its you and me for the
round-come-round strip off your

sea stories

jumper and be quick about it if you dont
want me to slug you just as you are

  oh very well grace acquiesced
without the slightest display of concern

  by this time the liberty party had come
on the run for all knew of the brewing
strife no less than a hundred men gath-
ered around the two in the center squirts
emotions long pent up now agitated his
heavy frame like jolts of electricity his
hands trembled so violently it was with
considerable difficulty that he slipped his
white jumper over his head his eyes
dwelt gloatingly on the lithe form of his
antagonist he viewed with scorn the
slender almost girllike figure the skin
too was clear and of a delicate pink con-
trasting markedly with the hairy rough-
ened coarse-splotched hide of the older
man

  chief petty officer gunthorpe worked
his way around to a spot behind grace
and whispered you dont have to fight
that gorilla unless you want to kid ill
stand by you

  thanks chief but ill have to sooner
or later just as well now

  for a short time it appeared as if
grace might emerge the victor he suc-
cessfully evaded the heavy blows of his
slower-moving opjxment and was able to
jab and short punch squirt at will every
telling blow brought clamorous voices of
approval from the spectators cries of
kill the big mutt little fellow now look
out for that haymaker right follow
it up kid follow it up and other mes-
sages of encouragement came from the
crowd but squirt stung into vehement
rage by the success of the hit-and-run
method wildly rushed grace backward un-
til he was jammed against the ring of on-
lookers then squirt swung wild rights
and lefts until one a vicious right upper-
cut broke aside the light guard and fairly
lifted grace off his let and into oblivion
he slumped into a heap among those most
eager to assist a handkerchief dipped in
water finally brought him back to earth
several men held gunthorpe in restraint
for he was determined to clean up on
the skunk rough jeering accompanied
squirt on his way back to the dock at
his moment of victory he was easily the
most unpopular man in the fleet

  say chief grace smiled rather
sheepishly i never knew there was so
many stars nor so many different kinds i
land tadics



saw flat and square ones big and little
black and blue

  thats all right sonny take your time
the gig just came in and said our liberty
boat was broken down out there in the
harbor and probably wouldnt be in for
an hour how do you feel

  fine

  a small crowd accompanied them back
to the landing where sailors were sitting
in small groups awaiting their boat
squirt sat alone but he had a small stand-
ing audience he was as usual spouting
about how he always got the man he went
after be he either big or small these
little birds he spoke loudly as graces
bunch came abreast the spot where he
sat always take advantage of their size
but i take a crack at a man according to
the size of his mouth if he talks big lies
big enough for a big man

  with due deliberation grace walked
easily over to where squirt sat and with
a full-open hand brought a resounding
slap across the puffed lips of the blatant
quartermaster

  why you dirty little cur ill kill you
he growled through gritted teeth as he
sprang to his feet

  again it was as before a big heavy
man rushing wildly against a quick sharp
smaller man whose wicked jabs tore
through the shaggy defense of the larger
man gunthorpe remembering the occur-
rence that caused graces defeat before
made all the men draw back until the two
fought in an open space at least fifty feet
between lines at times grace stopped a
heavy blow but for the most he was
aside below or too far away for the dyna-
mite carriers shot in his direction the
smaller mans chief method was to feint
an attack then drop aside and slam several
blows to his opponents head as he made a
wild-bull rush which carried him far be-
yond his antagonist

  those watching noted the slackening
speed of the logy quartermaster at an
early stage of the second battle two
fights in one day was about one too many
for squirt those lightninglike blows
kept pecking away at eyes and mouth until
the latter was a swollen mass of blood and
froth gradually the eyes began to close
exhibiting at the same time well-pro-
nounced rings of discoloration the reali-

zation that he must end the battle quickly
came to squirt but his rushes of despera-
tion but added to the surety of graces
blows there came the time when squirt
like a blinded beast struck wildly in every
direction but try as he did grace found-
it impossible to knock his man out the
side lines were calling for victory get
a hammer little fellow no use to use
your fist on a block like that take off
your shoe and hit him with that there
he is squirt right in front of you why
dont you sock him  derisively advised
one

  say when youve got enough grace
offered

  a filthy oath was the reply

  two stinging jabs one on the swollen
picklelike nose and another to the now-
closed left eye needled squirt into mad-
dened action he flung himself forward
wildly swinging his arms as if he were
fighting yellow jackets grace coolly
watched the oncoming rush then stepped
aside and as squirt passed caught him
a heavy blow just below his right ear
grace had put his every ounce of strength
into the jolt and squirt went on a long
long voyage five minutes later lie came
out of the maze accompanied by heavy
shots of pasig river water administered
by means of a fire bucket assailing his
ears was a wild raucous cheering lifting
his head weakly he saw a long string of
joyous gobs playing ring around a rosy
about his late combatant evidently
grace had seen squirt move for he came
over and stooping offered his hand

  shake old man he spoke cheerily
 twasnt a bad scrap

  mcduff twisted his swollen roaring
head a fraction of an inch sidewise so
that he could peer up at grace out of a
tiny crack in his face which almost con-
cealed an eye

  twould a been different if i hadnt
been sick he whined i dont know
whatsamatter you dont like me i never
did look for trouble with you but i
aint gonna shake hands what else you
want you licked me aint that enough
i dont want  more i wish youd shove
off and leave me alone cause im mighty
dog-gone sick

  he dropped his head back to earth
again and closed the eye

deck loads on the northwest coast

hen a ship goes to sea with lum-
ber there is abundant occasion for
the masters genius to shine forth
the amount of pay load below
decks depends largely on the skill with
which he can stow this elusive cargo while
above decks at least on west coast steam
schooners the principal factor is nerve
that both of these requisites were funda-
mental in the character of rough-pile
jensen could be judged from the size of
the cargoes he took to sea steam schoon-
ers and lumber he knew better than a mon-
key docs coconuts yet the best evidence
of his real genius perhaps lay in the fact
that hjalmar petersen was his mate

  they had brought the bluff-bowed
skarnokawa to the big wilson mill in the
mouth of tide creek and were tossing
boards into her bottom as fast as jitneys
could gallop them out to the stringpiece
standing beside the winch drivers petersen
rapidly sized up parcels coming aboard
and bawling out directions to the sweating

gang below was placing them so deftly
that scarcely enough broken stowage re-
mained to house a cricket

  the hatches were battened and the deck
load was coming aboard helter-skelter
two thirds of the cargo would be carried
above deck and speedy loading was more
important than orderly arrangement
chains were clapped onto sling loads as
they dropped from the jitneys falls were
jerked with the utmost energy of the throb-
bing winches and lumber came tossing
aboard like giant handfuls of jackstraws
every stick that could be jammed onto the
vessel would thus somehow find its resting
place and not until the scuppers amidships
were awash would they call a halt to the
loading then after sailing the vessels
crew would be occupied the first day or
two at sea with the task of straightening
and lashing this rough-piled deck load
against the assaults of heavy weather

  hjalmar petersen mate of the skamo-
kawa had been much more intimate with


sea stories

lumber during his seagoing career than
with the niceties of social discourse or the
rules of etiquette a man of simple and
direct address his dealings with crew and
stevedores were based on a vigorous how
of highly descriptive steam-schooner pro-
fanity backed by a pair of fists greatly
resembling an alert pair of well-smoked
no  hams thus amply equipped he
conducted lumber operations with such
smooth dispatch that no altercation among
his gang ever lasted long enough to delay
the delivery of a sling load from the ves-
sels falls not even rough-pile jensen
ever worked more swiftly and efficaciously
in straightening and lashing the mountain-
ous deck loads with which the skaniokawa
usually staggered out to sea past clatsop
spit

  but the smooth completion of their task
on this occasion had been somewhat im-
paired by a quarrel smoldering between
master and mate during the arduous la-
bor of the few days preceding both men
were brought close to the breaking point
mainly from overstrained nerves the
stevedores knocked off for supper at five
and the mate had signified his intention
of going ashore rough-pile scanned his
features with a look of suspicion

  cant you stay and have your supper
on board he asked sharply have to
have a few drinks i suppose

  the mate scowled how you expect
a faller work like hell all de time  all day
all night

  yes i know but nobody can do it
unless he stays sober which is more than
you have been doing when you came
aboard last night you were drunk and
in absolute violation of the rules of the
ship

  mounting anger was showing in the
crimson flush of the mates cheeks by
damn ve load von hundred tousand be-
fore midnight you call him drunk dis
kind loading you better haf same ting
two-tree time without waiting for fur-
ther discussion he strode to the compan-
ionway climbed to the boat deck and
stepped ashore

  when the mate returned to the vessel
an hour or so later rough-pile was wait-
ing on deck well fit to work a little
bit i hope he rasped out i just sent
two of the stevedore gang ashore for re-
porting under the influence of liquor
whats that you brought with you you

know very well you cant have a bottle on
board of this ship hand it over

  scowling darkly petersen dragged forth
the bottle which had been protruding from
his pocket slowly he reached it out to
rough-pile who snatched it with a quick
gesture then crashed it sharply against a
stringer of the wharf the skipper there-
upon turned on his heel and went into
the cabin

ights gleamed brightly along the
wharf as loading continued as the
vessel settled into the water the
mounting stacks of lumber had so in-
creased in height that scarcely could one
discern the ship beneath them rough-pile
was again on the boat deck he walked
along with hands clasped behind him then
went to the rail to note the vessels water
line as he did so something caught his
eye bobbing here and there in thewater
beneath the wharf were the necks of empty
bottles most likely some that had been
tossed from his own ship

  turning as though by a sudden resolve
he flung open a door and descended the
companionway bursting into the crews
quarters he strode to the nearest berth
jerked off the bedclothes and fumbled be-
hind the mattress he brought forth a
bottle half filled with reddish-brown fluid
in the next bunk he found another he
picked them up and took them to his cabin 
then a moment later he was out on the
deck fixing a quizzical eye on petersen

  stowage of the california flitches was
giving more trouble than usual a chain
sling had failed to disengage when with-
drawn by the winch and scattered a sling
load of lumber over the entire width of
the vessel sharply petersen cursed the
winch driver as he looked up he caught
jensens questioning eye and turned in
sullen silence to regard the confusion
about him another sling load was to be
shoved forward and hung poised while
one of his men inserted a dolly underneath
the load came down before the dolly was
placed then some one raised a peavey and
knocked loose the hook the dolly rolled
a foot or two and turned over awkwardly
spilling its entire load more confusion

  again petersen turned on the winch
driver but the masters cold glare arrested
his words he raised his shoulders in a
shrug and bent to catch up a peavey from

sea-
rough-pile



the deck another sling load was coming
aboard and he saw that the chain had been
attached too far from the center despite
his yell of protest the winches hoisted rap-
idly and swung the load over the deck
with one end hanging straight down
peterson signaled his crew to steady the
load as it reeled about uncertainly but
several pieces slid through the chain and
dropped the men jumped from below
the winch driver lowered away suddenly
when he saw his load loosening and
crashed it heavily over a handrail along
the deck house one of the pieces shot
out and caught petersen across the leg

  in an outburst of anger the huge mate
grabbed up the board and flung it violently
toward his awkward gang then with un-
restrained profanity he spoke his mind to
the winch driver jensens cold regard but
added to the heat with which he expressed
himself one of the men in the gang gave a
sneering laugh toward this man petersen
now sprang and with outstretched hand
dealt him a resounding blow the man
went reeling against the timbers anybody
else get funny now asked the mate as
he glowered for an instant he then
turned and climbed to the boat deck disap-
pearing with jensen into the little cabin

  i ban haf enough dese here monkay
beesness the mate began his face flushed
and wet with perspiration he pulled the
heavy gloves from his hands and threw
them down wiped his dripping brow on
the sleeve of his undershirt and gave way
to deep-felt ardent protest you haf
fine peeg-head idea on dese ship-fine for
sunday school hah he gave a snort
of disgust but yackass need whack on
back some time you try teekle heem wid
feather hah you want i should talk
lady talk to dese faller all time hah all
right but by yingo not to dese kind hard
faller like ban on dese schooner

  jensen regarded him calmly for a mo-
ment then pointed to the bottles which
he had placed on his table see here
now petersen ive told you how to run
this ship and i want it run that way its
time this trade got a little civilized you
all live and act like a lot of swine thats
why i have to regulate everything for you
down to the smallest details now i want
you to slap on the rest of that lumber in
a hurry and you dont need to use any
unnecessary profanity about it either

 sea-

theres no job about a steam schooner that
cant be filled by a gentleman

  it was this last word which carried the
mates frazzled temper beyond the danger
point his eyes became two narrow red
slits yantleman hell he roared
what kind of faller you tink coom on
dese boat dance-hall yonny by yoe
i get me off dese boat planty quick and
you find out someting you want yantle-
man hah not on same boat wid peter-
sen by yee i go over see yimmy wilson
and get me yob damn quick he shook
his fist in rage

  rough-pile regarded him with a grave
countenance dont get to thinking we
cant get along without you there was
never a mate alive so important as that
when you begin to think ive got to have
you then its time for you to leave if
you want to go right now heres your
chance

  i dont vait for chance so long you
vant yantleman on dese boat i get off and
stay off by damn i ban get planty dese
monkay circus yantleman hah his
countenance still flaming with anger as
he gave this final snort of disgust the
mate strode to the door jerked it open
banged it violently behind him and went
out on deck

noading continued with eric skjal-
lund pressed into service as mate
but rough-pile was finding it neces-
sary to give personal attention to every
plank that came aboard october gales
would be blowing outside after they left
the river and if their deck load was to
hold fast timbers must be distributed judi-
ciously through the mass for stiffening
stays should be interlaced along the sides
and braced tightly against the stanchions
careful blocking must be worked in be-
tween unmatched tiers to prevent their
working loose

  shortly before loading had been com-
pleted the watson tug celeste pulled down
the creek escorting the barge washougal
which had for some time been receiving
lumber from an adjoining wharf the
craft was a converted four master which
had been purchased from one of the alaska
fisheries fleets and adapted to the coast-
wise lumber trade the owners were
boasting to the steam-schooner world of
the wonders they planned to accomplish
in the way of lowered transportation costs


sea stories

for lumber their experiment was being
watched by most onlookers with a large
measure of skepticism

  rough-pile in particular had regarded
the barge venture with no little disapproval
even more unenthusiastic still was his
opinion of matt raker who had command
of the tug one close shave and youre
through he had told watson unless you
put a man aboard your tug get a man
not a rabbit

  the tug and her convoy were passing
the dock where the skamokazva remained
tied youve got the whole channel
there matt raker was blustering out to
rough-pile in a loud voice you better
haul ship a little till we get past

  if you cant get past here the colum-
bia aint wide enough for you rough-pile
retorted unsympathetically

  the barge was dragged along down the
creek and rough-pile stood watching its
slow progress it nearly grazed his own
vessel and as the stern came even with
his position he was startled to see that
the helmsman in charge was hjalmar
petersen without speaking the two men
stood and glowered at each other as the
barge slowly moved out toward the chan-
nel of the columbia

hen the skamokazva finally backed
out into the river and headed down-
stream it had the appearance of a
huge load of lumber with a ship fastened
somewhere beneath heavy rain was fall-
ing and the dark firs along the banks had
begun to wave their branches sighingly in
the fresh southwest breeze within a
couple of hours the vessel had passed as-
toria and continued seaward before they
reached the river mouth complete darkness
had overtaken them and a heavy wind
was rolling up huge watery crests into
which their bow dipped with deep rhyth-
mical plunges

  during the trip down river rough-pile
had been urging his men to their utmost
endeavors for the deck load would need
much adjusting and lashing in preparation
for sea it was not until they reached the
lightship that rough-pile realized the force
of the blow that had sprung up glint-
ing lights reflected from the beacon above
were moving swiftly along the great silent
walls of water which swept in from sea-
ward the clumsy iron hull of the light-
ship came wallowdng over the top of a

crest with its tight-stretched anchor chain
clanking in the hawsepipe in its eccen-
tric careenings rough-pile sensed the sav-
age thrust which a whipping breeze and
resentful seas were launching against
everything afloat they hurried by the
lightship less than a ships length distant
with the rain stinging his face rough-
pile stared reflectively from his boat deck
the beacon so illuminated the moving
ocean floor near by that huge drifting
patches of white foam alternated strangely
with areas of impenetrable blackneess

  as their vessel headed southward
rough-pile was on deck watching for the
first glimpse of tillamook light their
blunt bow was shouldering heavily into
oncoming seas and occasionally remained
buried long enough for a crest to buck
heavily against their load of lumber de-
spite their compact massive weight vessel
and cargo would occasionally meet swift-
moving broken crests with a rending shock
that threatened to loosen the chains im-
prisoning the deck load anxiously
rough-pile climbed along the length of the
vessel with flash light in hand examining
stanchions and lashings he then called
skjallund

  take a couple of men and lash those
starboard stanchions to keep em upright
the cargos working away from them and
theyll be coming loose send some one
out to take up those turnbuckles if one
on those lashings lets go were in a smear

  returning to the pilot house rough-pile
remained near the helmsman watching
anxiously as the flash of tillamook light
drew gradually abeam he then went for-
ward again to note the condition of his
load some of the impetuous combers
which drenched over their quarter seemed
to shake the vessel as sharply as though
some gigantic sea monster had pounced
upon them rough-pile saw that the cargo
must be stiffened without delay

  put on the deck lights and call up the
crew he roared out to skjallund well
have to restow most of this lumber

  grasping a peavey he went forward atop
the load and clung to the winch platform
while he directed operations

  begin aft and work forward he told
skjallund tear the corners off the load
and pile it higher amidships take off one
lashing at a time and pass everything aft
that you can pull out wedge the bottom
tiers in tighter
rough-pile



  beginning their work as ordered the
weary crew labored at the stacks of lum-
ber loosening a few boards at a time they
worked these into a more compact mass
around the engine-room casing building
a tighter pile which they gradually ex-
tended forward as the bow sunk slug-
gishly into mounting watery hillocks an
occasional assaulting crest would leap the
forecastle head and sweep down the deck
load boiling into crevices and seething
into the pits around the winches each
time a sea came aboard rough-pile would
gaze anxiously to detect signs of move-
ment among the top-layer timbers then
turn to see if the struggling crew had all
clung safely to their handholds he called
the mate

  this loads liable to break across for-
ward of the mast you left too many sling
loads with the ends abreast we got to
build up from the lee side and make the
pieces interlock get these loads out of
the way first busy now and put some
snap into it before something washes off

  but  tell you sir the men have worked
cargo since early this morning and dont
feel very lively

  rough-pile fixed his mate with a look
of disgust and as the vessel lurched heav-
ily jabbed his peavey into a timber and
motioned for his men to take hold grab
on all of you and slide her aft no not
that one you fish head he bawled now
another all together a few more feet
now roll these pieces over to starboard

  gradually the men pulled apart the still
compact sling loads and drew the ends for-
ward and aft into crevices wherever they
could find space to fill working deeper
into the load they wedged braces into
opened gaps to prevent further movement
tearing down the top tiers with his peavey
rough-pile tumbled pieces down to the
men working below him hurriedly point-
ing directions for shifting their positions

  vainly he strove to accelerate the job
but the impetus of his crew was only main-
tained when he could personally direct the
handling of each stick skjallund was
fumbling ineffectually among a group of
men that transferred pieces first in one
direction then in another more and more
frequently seas thundered over their quar-
ter while the men clung in almost continual
helplessness to their handholds suddenly
a gigantic black crest swelled up around
their bow and seemed to envelop the en-

tire vessel and cargo the mass of water
flashed suddenly white along the deck load
and charged at the loosened timbers on
which the men were working

  as the ship trembled beneath the impact
rough-pile turned quickly and saw the
danger to the men below him he promptly
threw his weight onto his peavey and
wedged the outermost timber against the
chain lashings but under the smashing
force of water the pile shook loose some-
where below several tiers crumpled and
a mass of loosened timbers was sluiced
like so much froth down over the men

  when the water had cleared away sev-
eral men were left struggling beneath the
overturned timbers with a shout rough-
pile leaped down and applied his heavy
shoulder to release them straining thick
knotted muscles to raise the heavy tangled
mass his back arched up slowly beneath
the crushing weight while the men cling-
ing to handholds above groped into the
darkness and dragged the victims forth

  rough-pile had them removed to the
tiny saloon aft where he worked over their
injuries hm three broken ribs he
muttered to himself as he examined the
first case bending over another man he
discovered a broken arm and a dislocated
shoulder he called skjallund break
out the medicine chest and get some band-
ages and dressings the chiefll help
you get everything ready for me to splint
up this fracture when i get back send
everybody else forward ill be on the
deck load

  throughout the night rough-pile con-
tinued his struggle to pin down the load
of timbers no sooner had his gang fin-
ished shifting and wedging and lashing in
one place than signs of loosening would
develop somewhere else skjallund
doubted his ultimate success hadnt we
better knock the shackles loose and let er
go he inquired finally rough-pile stared
at him incredulous his patience was at
the breaking point

  when the deck load goes the shipll go
with it he thundered ive never cut
loose a deck load yet and ill hang on this

get up forward there now and see what
you can do to stop those timbers from
banging against the forepeak

  after a final inspection of his cargo
rough-pile went to his cabin for an hours
rest despite his fatigue sleep seemed an
sea stories

impossibility for some time be listened
to the wind tugging at the canvas lifeboat
covers just outside his door occasionally
causing them to flap violently with a noise
like pistol shots as an occasional giant
crest met the bow with a dull impact he
would find himself listening nervously for
the heavy splash of water that always
came drenching aboard a second after

  he had begun to wonder about the
washougal petersen must have cooled
off by this time and begun to regret his
change of berth it was not a pleasant
time to be at sea on a barge petersen
must have been well aware that matt raker
was no man to depend upon in a blow
after one such trip he would undoubtedly
be glad to come back to his proper place
on a respectable steam schooner rough-
pile resolved that when he reached san
francisco bay lie would immediately hunt
up petersen and have a talk with him
they would soon reach an understanding

hile lie was engaged in these re-
flections the a b on watch came
to his door and rapped insistently
he entered the room and as rough-pile
raised himself  one elbow the man be-
gan excitedly distress signals on the
port bow sir cant make out the kind of
vessel but shes over there by the beach

  snatching an oilskin rough-pile fol-
lowed to the bridge and stared into the
darkness i a few minutes they caught
the flash of a rocket outlined against the
gloom of a distant rocky cliff more than
three miles of tumbling sea intervened
rough-pile turned and burst through the
door of the little pilot house give me
that wheel he said tensely to the steers-
man

  there seemed  chance for doubt the
washougal had broken from the tug dur-
ing the night raker of course must
have put to sea for his own safety rough-
pile turned his vessel sharply toward the
shore straining his eyes for the first
glimpse of the distressed vessel

  dawn began to break faintly as they
drew in toward the first series of rocky
ledges lining the shore farther in they
discerned outlines of a craft which they
could recognize as the washougal out
with the sounding lead ordered rough-
pile curtly were going in after them

  when the skamokawa approached they
saw the barge had a sea anchor to keep it

headed into the storm but under the im-
pulse of surging rollers that periodically
raked its length it was drifting rapidly
shoreward it had already advanced far
into danger and only the promptest assist-
ance with a towline could save it from
catastrophe

  skjallund came in to receive instructions
no use for lifeboats in here rough-pile
boomed out bottoms too close these
combersll be breaking over any minute
now youll need the men to hold the deck
load down anyway get a heaving line
ready

  in the growing light they discerned the
black masses of frowning cliff toward
which the washougal was drifting and
shuddered to realize how close they were at
hand huge breakers driven by the fury
of wind and sea were crashing headlong
at the foot of the rocky pinnacles and
springing suddenly upward with a ghostly
show of whiteness in the gloom the
roaring surf echoed from the shore line
with a dull ominous moan which they
could hear only faintly against the wind

  as they crept closer to the barge they
could see the heavy bow rise slowly in the
smashing crests a broken length of an-
chor chain dangling uselessly from the
hawse pipe some one stood near the bow
of the barge watching their approach
they came closer rough-pile swung the
lead of the heaving line and let it fly
the line described a long arc in the driv-
ing gale and dropped over the side of the
barge now only fifty yards distant he
watched as one of the barges crew sprang
forward but before he could grasp the line
the huge figure of petersen had suddenly
leaped at him picked it up and thrown
it overboard it dropped into the water
with a splash

  youre crazy man bawled rough-
pile at the top of his lungs again the
line was flung out across the water and
again petersen violently beset the man
who tried to seize it he then went to the
rail and shouted angrily at rough-pile his
menacing gestures stating plainly that he
wanted  assistance

  for reply rough-pile shook his fist and
gave forth a hoarse yell of defiance if
the barge was to be rescued from its plight
some one would have to act in the great-
est haste gimme that line rough-pile
called to the man nearest him before
any one could read his intentions he was
rough-pile



at the rail with a slender length of hemp
tied about his waist ill be aboard of
that hulk in two minutes make ready
to pay out your hawser when i signal

  rough-pile flung himself from the rail
onto the next turbulent crest that passed
them disappeared for an instant then
bobbed to the surface he struck out
swimming for the barge with a powerful
overhand crawl the men paying out the
line watched breathlessly as successive
crests closed over the skippers head but
the quick rhythmical strokes kept on un-
varied each time he reappeared swinging
wide of the bow he progressed steadily
until he came amidships of the barge and
as a wave surged high alongside clasped
both arms about a stanchion of the flyrail
here he clung for a moment to catch his
breath

  some instinct of sportsmanship pre-
vented petersen from offering opposition
to the struggling swimmer although he
seemed undecided about assisting him on
board as the big mate stared toward the
rail rough-pile had clambered aboard the
wallowing hulk and started toward the
bow with his line petersen intercepted
him you go to the devil he shouted
his eyes narrowing get that line off
haar you get no salvage from dese haar
boat

  you cursed fool bellowed out rough-
pile what do i care for salvage you
got to take a line its the only chance you
got in this world youll be piled up any
minute now

  no line from you by yingo i take
no line from you i trow it oferboard

  he reached out to seize the line which
rough-pile had brought with him as he
did so rough-pile stepped forward and
drove straight at him with a heavy fist
petersen caught the blow glancingly then
sounding a yell of rage came at the skip-
per with a savage thrust of his own for-
midable left which he aimed at the jaw
rough-pile coolly side-stepped and retali-
ated with two successive smashing jaibs
into the ribs which caused petersen to
catch his breath

  they both squared off for a moment
then attacked simultaneously petersen
charged with lowered head whereupon
rough-pile swung a swift uppercut against
his chin again petersen rushed in with
arms extended the vessel lurched as they
came together and they fell in a clinch

rolling to the scuppers rough-pile had
pinned the other mans arms and was
astride him for a moment when another
heavy roll of the vessel carried them both
sprawling to the other side of the deck
as they fetched up against a heavy iron
cleat the top of petersens head struck
with a violent impact and his muscles
went suddenly limp rough-pile caught
hold of the rail and raising himself on
one knee surveyed the huge recumbent
form beneath him with a quick anxious
look he then jumped to his feet ran
quickly to the rail and signaled the steamer
with a w-ave of his arm

  with furious speed rough-pile began
hauling in on the slender line he had
dragged through the water motioning the
two sailors on the barge to assist him a
messenger line had come onto the barge
and as the trio in her bow began reeling in
with frantic haste they saw a heavy new
length of manila hawser being fed out
through a chock on the skamokaiva des-
perately they tugged away to speed its
long snaky course through the intervening
stretch of lashing seas

  bending their backs against its weight
they slowly lifted the hawser from the wa-
ter at the washougals bow with a final
concerted heave they dragged the end
aboard and looped the eye over the nearest
cleave knotted to the eye was another
length of lighter line by which a second
hawser could be hauled aboard from the
steamer

  the hawser fast rough-pile sent one
of the seamen to the barges helm while
he waved his vessel to take them in tow
less than a ships length away a receding
crest laid bare one of the huge sharp-
pointed boulders which fringed the shore
line while ominous whitening of the waves
disclosed here and there jutting points of
the treacherous reef through which they
must thread their course as the skamo-
kawa worked oft to seaward the big yellow
line slowly merged from the ocean and
stretched tight wringing out sea water as
the coils drew together a huge comber
came swelling around the clumsy prow of
the barge and they heard the line groan
in the chocks as it tautened like a fiddle-
string rough-pile waited breathlessly to
see it part but his crew at the steamers
capstan let out slack just in time to ease
the strain

  the barge began to move slowly sea-


sea stories

ward rough-pile then went and knelt
over where petersen still lay in the scup-
pers examining his head he found a long
scalp wound with heavy blood clots form-
ing through the matted hair he called
the seaman nearest him got any surgi-
cal needles he asked the man shook
his head rough-pile pondered petersen
began to stir and was feeling with his hand
at the cut he partly raised himself and
stared blankly at rough-pile then glanced
over and saw that his barge was in tow
uttering a deep growl he lurched awk-
wardly to his feet

  without allowing petersen opportunity
to clear his head or to act rough-pile
sprang at him with the sudden impetus of
a panther a fist whipped out from his
shoulder and went straight to the point of
petersens chin dropping him to the de 
like a bag of shot the seaman stared at
him blankly and rough-pile motioned him
closer

  hed chop the line loose if we let him
besides this cut has got to be sewed up
he said pointing to the top of the mates
head and im taking him back to the
steamer ive got to get started while hes
still out help get him to the rail and
bring me that small line attached to the
towrope

  the barge liad been pulled away from
imminent danger as the skamokazva
worked out toward sea rough-pile stud-
ied the waves a moment then motioned for
his vessel to maneuver back in toward
them taking the end of the light line
which had come with the hawser he knot-
ted it about petersens chest and with the
help of the sailor rolled his heavy bulk
to the top of the rail opposite the steamer
when the gap between the two vessels
had closed appreciably he waited for a
crest to spring upward then shoved out
from the side of the barge with petersen
in his arms the steamers crew saw the
two forms splash heavily into the ocean
and busily hauling away at the line dragged
them in toward their lee rail

  as the steamer wallowed in giant seas
several of her crew had clambered along
the deck load to pull the skipper aboard
eager hands fastened into petersens
clothing and steadied him in his groggy

climb from the reach of the buffeting
waves he was still dazed as rough-pile
helped him aft and through the door into
the cabin

is head stitched and bandaged peter-
sen lay in his snug berth aboard the
skamokcma and gazed about him
dreamily for a time he considered the
form bending over him several times his
eyes returned to the face above him lie-
fore recognition began to dawn he was
drifting toward the conclusion that it was
merely rough-pile jensen his skipper
this meant that everything was going well
enough of course but no-something
had happened he raised himself in the
berth

  vat am t doing haar he burst forth
suddenly who is mate on dese vessel 
he had begun to feel strangely uneasy

 rough-pile regarded him calmly
youre mate on this vessel youre the
only man who ever will be mate on this
vessel as longs im aboard of her how
you feel 

  petersen frowned not bad i ban
get up veres my clothes

  up in the fiddley getting dried out
theyll be ready for you by now

 petersen pondered a minute he
watched the bulkhead swing sharply to-
ward him then twist over dizzily as the
vessel smashed through a mountainous sea
she blow purty hard to-day he com-
mented how is dack load

  rough-pile eyed him a moment then
shook his head doubtfully itll hang on
if we have the right kind of mate to hold
it down look here petersen i want to
tell you something weve got that barge
of yours in tow well take it down to
san francisco bay and get rid of it if
any one mentions salvage awards ill tell
em to go to the devil im not after
salvage you know that well enough all
the salvage ill ever take ive got already
-the best mate that ever went to sea with
lumber ive got you back and im going
to keep you now soons you feel like it
you better get out forward and see that
everythings fastened longs i dont lose
my mate i dont ever expect to lose a deck
load

he ocearv mystery

 jvictor

nn the course of many years spent
at sea several adventures have
come my way but the one i am

- about to relate impressed me more

than any other for it brought home to
ail of us on the ship how mysterious and
merciful are the ways of providence

  the illovo was an old steamer slow out
of date and small the twenty-odd pas-
sengers were berthed aft the saloon run-
ning right into the stern and the cabins
opening on either side above the long
dining table was a big skylight which
opened on the after deck in fine weather
she was like a yacht but in bad weather
fully loaded she was as uncomfortable as
a water-logged derelict

  in - r forget the date-we were
down to our marks alongside durban
wharf ready to sail for london via cape-
town most of the passengers came by
train from uipcountry and they were any-
thing but pleased to find such a small
craft you will understand how tiny she
looked when i say that the captain on
the bridge could lean over and shake hands
with a person on the quay several pas-
sengers thought she was a tender merely
to convey them to the ocean-going
steamer there were loud expressions of
disapproval and many people blamed
themselves for not booking by the wara-
tah the latter was indeed a splendid ves-
sel and had been well advertised in the

newspapers she was a big powerful
ship less than a year old trading between
australia and england calling at durban
and the cape for passengers and was
listed to sail from durban a day after the
illovo

  that evening we steamed out from the
shadow of the bluff on the three-day run
to table bay the wind was fresh on
the port beam with a moderate seta and
the little laden ship made good progress
a strong current runs down the natal
coast and our captain kept well away from
the land to get full advantage of it

  during the night the wind shifted to
the port bow and the next morning-i
remember the day was sunday-a gale was
blowing later it developed to almost hur-
ricane force and by sunset the illovo could
barely made steerage way

  that sunday night our little craft
handled skillfully by the grim scot who
was in command fought the fury of the
almighty sea she rose up to the towering
seething hills and slithered down into the
valleys between trembling and vibrating
as if with fear cataracts of pure un-
diluted ocean poured over the bows leav-
ing no vestige of one hundred tons of coal
which had been placed on the fore deck
in durban the men driven from the
focsles sought what little shelter there
was in the midship alleyways

  in the cabin aft which was battened
sea stories

down the terror-stricken passengers
groaned as the sound of the chill thud of
heavy water penetrated into the cheerless
sodden saloon seasickness added to their
misery several poor souls seemed to find
relief by reiterating statements of their
stupidity in not going ashore immediately
they had embarked and waiting for the
war at ah so passed the night of howling
gale

  the day was no better certainly light
made visible the surrounding miles of deso-
lation but if anything they only intensi-
fied the minuteness and fragility of the
cockleshell which stood between us and
eternity

  another night came the massed attacks
of the leaping seas continued they came
onward with the impetus of a swing
which began over a thousand miles away
somewhere in the chill antarctic and all
the time the grim brine-blistered scot
patiently stood upon the shaking bridge
nursing the plunging rearing bucking
vessel

  in those days few ships were fitted with
wireless telegraphy once you were be-
yond signaling distance of the shore no
help could be summoned unless by chance
another ship hove in sight in this in-

stance no help was necessary thanks to
the builders of the lllovo and the skill of
her captain the next day the weather
moderated and eventually we got into cape-
town after a passage of five days instead
of three

  most of the passengers went ashore
declaring their intention of going to the
agents and demanding their money back
preferring to wait for the waratah

  what happened i do not know doubt-
less the agent pointed out the tonnage of
the ship was correctly stated on the com-
panys advertisements and after their re-
cent experiences even the most timid pas-
sengers could have no fear as to the ships
seaworthiness anyhow they all returned
on board and so far as i know had a
pleasant voyage

   what i do know is passengers and crew
experienced a feeling of awe and thank-
fulness when we dropped anchor in las
palmas a fortnight later for the wara-
tah which had left durban on schedule
had vanished with all hands from the face
of the waters

   it seems inexplicable that such a fine
big steamer should disappear on so short
a trip and her fate remains to this day an
unsolved mystery of the sea
ere is yet another example of
the popularity and scope of this
department the first letter
which appears in these pages for
this issue is sent us by the mate of com-
mander byrds vessel the eleanor doling
this officer charles j mcguiness sent
his communication from dunedin new
zealand which is the mail address for the
expedition we sincerely hope that there
are some of mr mcguiness old shipmates
among our readers

  you will note that mr mcguinnes
speaks of having served in the american
four-masted bark annie m reid this is
the vessel that wc spoke of in the sep-
tember  issue as the howard d
troop she was a nova scotiaman under
that name and had made a truly remarkable
passage from the tail of the bank to new
york of fourteen days this fine bark
has always maintained her reputation for
smartness under both her registries

  the daylight mentioned by our corre-
spondent was one of the big case-oil ships
operated by the standard oil company
from this country to the orient this
trade if it is still in existence is now car-
ried out by steamers if we remember
correctly the last sailing ship owned by
the standard oil and operated in this trade
was the four-masted bark drmneltan she
ran under british registry up until about

h

the end of the war and was a regular trader
from new york to hongkong

  shortly after the war she was sold to
the french and called the margaret over-
man this ship was a sight to delight the
eye of any sailor as her deck structures
were entirely of teak this included the
deck houses on the main deck as well as
the chart house on the poop and the sky-
lights these were always kept well
cleaned and varnished we said that she
was a sight to delight the eye of any
sailor but on second thought we will
change that statement she was a sight
to delight the eye of any critical mate or
captain your foremast hand when he
sees such great areas of bright work is
filled with disgust at the thought of keep-
ing it all looking well he is the only
one who really appreciates the amount of
work that it means

  we have lost all tracc of this vessel but
she has either been broken up or is being
used as a hulk somewhere

  having been a reader of your magazine for
some years and always an interested peruser
of the log book i want you to say hello for
me to any of your deep-water friends who are
interested in a deep-water sailor oncc more
afloat

  after a few years ashore the desire to re-
turn to sea in sail became pretty strong so you
can imagine how glad i was to be appointed
chief officer in commander byrds expedition
ship the bark city of new york i had the

this department is a meeting
place for all readers of this
magazine it is free to all for
the purpose of open discussion

sea stories

interesting job of rigging her out for the polar
trip changing her rig from a barkcntine to a
bark i also put a new jib boom mizzen-top-
mast and fore yard in her to replace those
spars which we found none too secure for a
rough passage

  i have sailed most of my seafaring life in
square-rigged vessels under many flags holding
on to the old system even after the time when
they were getting scarce

  my recent voyages were in the british four-
masted bark medway of london-durban to
iquique capetown to colombo and ceylon
-lasting thirteen months in the latter port
i had the job of dismantling her after we paid
the crew off and then i went back to europe
the next ship was the bark daylight belong-
ing to the standard oil company frisco to
kobe and manila and back to frisco in eleven
months that was her last voyage then the
bark annie m reid frisco to ipswich i after-
ward commanded auxiliary schooners and bark-
cntines

  we are now laid up for the winter in dunedin
and i am at present in the eleanor boling so
if any of your readers would care to drop me
a line it will surely be appreciated and if
any of the younger crowd want information
pertaining to ships or the sea i will find time
to answer them i have tried to preserve all
the wrinkles i have learned since i was a boy
for we must soon face the idea of a sea with-
out sails	charles j mcguiness

ur next letter is a complaint of a
mild sort shipmate armbrust
wants to see more stories from the
black gang his reasons for wanting them
are very good and we are constantly striv-
ing to meet his requirements but we
would like to assure our shipmate that
youth and inexperience are no bar to being
heard in the log book this is one ship
in which each man is as good as the next
there are no officers to call a youngster
for speaking out of turn and the old hands
are impressed with the fact that new men
have as much right to speak right out in
meeting as they have

  but as far as experience is concerned
we would like to go on record that we have
now got two writers at least writing for
us who have had experience in the engine
room these are robert l allen and
e g martin and just as fast as we can
we are getting engine-room stories and
experiences another newcomer to our
pages who has had the severest kind of
experience around engines and boilers is
p renz

  being rather young and inexperienced it is
rather rude to ask to be a shipmate but hav-
ing served a short time-four months-as coal
passer aboard the u s s annapolis i would
like to become a member

  i fully agree with a shipmates expression-
i have forgotten his name-who said that what
we need is more stories about the engine and
firerooms i think that these stories equal
the topside stories you know in the days of
steam and sail instead of the days of sail and
steam you must talk of steam also

  i would like to hear the opinion of other sea-
men who have been in the hot filthy mediter-
ranean ports how they compare with our own

  i would be glad to offer advisory assistance
to any one of inexperience and would be glad
to do so if asked

  also i wonder if you could give me any
information as to the life of the three-masted
fore-and-aft schooner george e vernon of
which captain peter n armbrust was master
from about  to 

  make some one clean out bilge tanks until
they can write about engine rooms and firc-
rooms if posible this seems to be the only
possible way to get experience of that sort

plhipmate johnston of mel-
jj bourne australia sends us the fol-
lowing entertaining letter and tabu-
lated list of the aberdeen white star line
ships mr johnston makes these remarks
in the nature of a correction of a mis-
statement made in a recent log book let-
ter the letter which our shipmate writes
is one of the most complete substantia-
tions of a writers remarks that we have
ever seen and our correspondent is to be
congratulated on the completeness of his
information about this line of once-famous
sailing ships this is especially true in
these days when sailing ships are disap-
pearing so rapidly and changing hands and
registry as frequently as they have done in
the last few decades

  i am coming aft once more to make a cou-
ple of corrections in the log book of the
april issue shipmate foster mentions the aber-
deen white star liner patrician there has
never been an aberdeen clipper of this name
the phoenician a wooden bark of five hundred
and twenty-six tons was an aberdeen clipper
and she was the first true clipper to come to
autralia

  she was built in  by hood of aberdeen
then there was the patriarch the aberdeen
lines first iron ship she was built in 
by hood of aberdeen her tonnage was one
thousand three hundred and thirty-nine register
she cost twenty-four thousand pounds to build
and on her maiden voyage she went to sydney
in sixty-seven days and came home to london
in sixty-nine days

  her best days run was three hundred and
sixty-six miles this was wonderful work for
an rn ship- her end is correctly described
by shipmate foster who no doubt has meant
her for the patriarch i just mention this as
the log book

i know that the shipmates like to keep their
records as straight a possible

  shipmate duval asked about the norge i
have sent particulars to him privately but no
doubt the other readers may be interested the
norge was an iron ship built in  by rich-
ardson duck  company of stockton for the
merchant shipping company as the peterbor-
ough she was originally intended for a troop-
ship but was put into the sydney and mel-
bourne passenger trade where she put up some
very good passages toward the end of the
s she was sold to the norwegians and re-
named the norge i am afraid the foregoing
will take up too much space so i will close
first attaching a list of the aberdeen white
star clippers in the hope that it might interest
some of the readers

dt is seldom in these days that we
read of a sailing-ship race or have

- the opportunity of indulging in one
as a result of this we think that the fol-
lowing clipping from the glasgow weekly
herald will be of interest to many of you
this article was sent us by william mcln-
verry of toledo ohio we regret that
it is so short but those of us who are in
the know can read between the lines and
see the constant drive that obtained on a
deep-water passage when two ships of the
caliber of the thermopylce and cutty sark
were racing each other on a course that
took them half around the world

  i have been an appreciative reader of sea
stories since it was launched and i have
always been interested in the log book and its
contents from month to month so i have great
pleasure in inclosing a clipping from the glas-
gow weekly herald dated april th hoping
it may be of interest to you or some of your
readers or it may help to complete your rec-
ords regarding one of the ships mentioned

  the announcement that the famous old clyde-
built tea clipper cutty sark has now been re-
fitted at falmouth harbor as a training ship
is of interest to the few remaining members
of her crew who sailed in her during her rec-
ord-breaking voyages one of these is captain
alexander moodie son of the famous captain
moodie who commanded the cutly sark for
some years he lives in dumfries and can tell
many stirring tales of the wild races home from
china with the valuable cargoes of tea the old
clipper generally carried one of the most
exciting of these occurred when captain moodie
was an apprentice under his father in -
the epic race between the cutty sark and her
great rival the thermopylce the two vessels
drew out of shanghai harbor the same day
and a grim struggle to reach gravesend first
began

  for a while the rival vessels kept about
abreast then the cutty sark drew away ahead
bad weather then set in however and luck
turned against captain moodie twenty-four
days out a heavy sea tore away the cutty sarks
rudder the owners brother who was on board
for his health begged the captain to make for
the nearest port but the old man was adamant
and with the help of his son-the present cap-
tain moodie-rigged up a jury rudder an almost
unique feat in the annals of sailing ships
fighting against terrible odds the cutty sark
battled on but it was hopeless and the cap-
tain had the mortification of seeing his rival

fame for his wonderful performance in bring-
ing home his disabled ship than his rival did in
winning the race

william mcinverry

o	judge by the letters we have been
receiving about it shipmate wea-
vers account of his passage in the
b eng aim was very well received by all
hands-particularly those who have been
to the southward iti sailing ships captain
jones of newport news sent us a letter
about it which we published in the last
issue and we have two more letters to
go in this number of the log book

  the first letter is from an ex-sou-
spainer now in new york you will re-
member that mr weaver mentioned in
his letter that the bengairns main-topgal-
lant mast was sent aloft in an unorthodox
manner while she was refitting in sydney
after having been partially dismasted in a
blow of newcastle new south wales

  seamen have an accepted method of do-
ing all work connected with masting a
ship these methods have been handed
down by generations of sailors and are
supposed to be perfect but steel and iron
spars and rigging brought about changes
in these processes however sailors
while they are almost slaves to tradition
are not as absolutely bound up in it as
some people imagine in proof of this
there are the mottoes-different ships
different long splices and different ships
different places for the flying-jib halyards
these mean that while there is a standard
way of doing everything about a ship
there is also some other way of doing it
in most cases

  hence the interest of our correspondent
henry p kirk and his sailor friends when
they read of the bengairns main-topgallant
mast going aloft heel first so if mr
weaver secs this we would appreciate it
if he got in touch with shipmate kirk and
explained in greater detail just how that
spar was sent aloft and stepped after it
was gotten there

  in the log book of your splendid sea sto-
ries of may and june we read mr neil wea-
vers long and interesting letter about his spell-o
in the bengairn

  i am an old-timer myself being one of those
cast up on the beach during the hurricane that
wrecked the american and german fleets in
samoa in march  there are several old
shellbacks bunked here with me and we have
had a few arguments about how captain lear-

mont stepped that main-topgallant mast each
of us has sent that mast aloft heel first and
uprighted it and each of us insists that his
way is the only way that this can be done

  perhaps mr weaver would be kind enough
to tell us just how that mast was stepped you
know-finish the job my respects to mr
weaver and his captain and good luck to ska
stories	henry p kirk

olonel walter m hotz of
the los angeles sheriffs officev
raises a point in connection with
the pass of balmaha which mr weaver
mentioned in his letter those of you who
saw the letter may recall that we discussed
the identity of this vessel rather completely
at the time and our remarks were sub-
stantiated by several of the other readers
captain jones being one of them

 our own memory of the case of this
ship was rather sure as we were going to
sea at the time when the pass of balmaha
belmont and vincent were bought from
british owners by a boston firm it is
our impression that they were bought for
the purpose of carrying lumber to south
american ports on the atlantic range
at any rate they were used in this trade
for a while but when ocean freights
went skyrocketing after the outbreak of
the war in  and tonnage became scarce
they were put on the archangel run car-
rying cotton to russia

  but this ship was no clipper-a term
which is very loosely and erroneously used
properly speaking in the strictest sense
of the word the clipper era in the coun-
try ended before the civil war broke out
at its best it was a very loose term and
had nothing whatsoever to do with rig
a clipper ship was merely a deep-water
sailing vessel built with finer lines than
the average cargo box but as ships were
built to certain economic requirements this
style of naval architecture did not enjoy
a very protracted life

  they were brought into existence by the
california and australia gold rush and the
tea trade both these conditions had dis-
appeared before the civil war and at that
time steamers were breaking into the tea
trade as a result the fine-lined sailing
vessel was no longer built in this country
however the british continued to build
them for the later days of the tea trade
and the australian wool traffic

  to the best of our knowledge there is
not one single example of the true ameri-
can clipper is existence to-day there is
the log book



at least one british clipper but she is
lying at permanent moorings in dover and
no longer goes to sea however there
may still be several of the later british
wool clippers knocking around the high
seas under alien flags and names

  in the dictionary a clipper is simply de-
scribed as a kind of fast-sailing vessel
with a sharp bow if we could put the
best of the old clippers alongside a present-
day windjammer it is doubtful if one out
of one hundred laymen could tell which
was which and that would include a
large number of seafaring men too

  you will sec by my title that i am not a
sea dog but one who has read every issue of
sea stories with great interest especially the
log book

  it is in the may edition that i note on page
 that shipmate neil weaver in reciting
some of his experiences states that in  he
signed on the four-masted bengairn whose
original name was the pass of branda belong-
ing to rea  sons of liverpool which ship
was a sister to the pass of balmaha

  i am seeking this information-docs he infer
that the pass of balmaha was a four-masted
bark and that she was of british origin if
so i beg to inform your readers that i am a
personal friend of count von luckner who
commanded her during the world war under
the name of seeadler and that in his biography
entitled count luckner the sea devil one
of the first copies of which he presented to me
he shows a copy of a photograph of the ameri-
can clipper ship pass of balmaha she was
sailing under the flag of the united states then
a neutral country when she was first captured
by the british and later from the british by
the crew of a german submarine who took her
to hamburg

 on page  of this book he makes the
statement that they hit a sand bank but pushed
across without damage-further proof that
americans still know how to turn out a sturdy
clipper ship

  all this goes to show that this ship which
was a three-masted ship square-rigged on all
three masts was an american-built ship as far as
the count knew and i am quite sure he told me
personally that she was built in seattle wash-
ington for the lumber trade so was the four-
masted schooner vatcrland in which he toured
the world or at least half of it for the schooner
is now in long beach harbor california

  i would like very much to have some official
record of the pass of balmaha if she is not
of american build

colonel walter m hotz

oing a little further into the matter
of the pass of balmaha we can posi-
tively say that she was not built in
seattle in fact there has never been an
iron or steel full-rigged ship built in that
town and as to count luckners im-

pression that the vessel was built in this
country we think it rather strange every
iron or steel sailing ship carries a brass
plate under the break of the poop and in
a prominent position on the cabin bulk-
head on this plate are inscribed the
builders name and date of launching of
the ship the same thing also applies to
the ships bell this always is engraved
with the vessels original name and builder
and the date of her launching we have
been aboard old ships so thick with rust
and dirt that the bell was absolutely black
but after scratching away the dirt that cov-
ered the bell you could always find her
original name

  and such was not the case with the
pass of balmaha she was always a smart
ship whatever her changes of ownership
and registry there was seldom any green
mold on her bell

  in this issue of the magazine we are
running the fifth installment of our serial
adventures of an african slaver the
serial rights for this story were obtained
from albert  charles boni who own
all other rights to it it is a first-hand
account of the slave trade written by cap-
tain canot a young italian who made his
mark in that enterprise after serving as
an apprentice in american ships of the
time

ffjr john masefield of hill
crest boars hill oxford england
 would like to get some information
about the four-masted liverpool bark
wanderer as he is writing a history of
this vessel by information mr masefield
does not mean tonnage dimensions or
lists of owners-these are easily obtainable
from a number of different sources what
he does want is photographs of crew
groups such as the deep-water sailor loved
to have taken in foreign ports pictures of
officers and any details of their service in
her that may occur to such of our readers
as may know them also details of her
voyages if we have any readers who sailed
in her smart passages she made and any
little incident that would make interesting
reading in a book of this kind

  one of our authors g h southall
who wrote johnsons navy an inter-


esting little yarn about seal catching on
the kerguelens has sent us the following
poem for use in the log book mr
southall has another story coming out in
an early issue of the magazine this
poem is a parody on an older one of the
same name

little jim

 a barkentine from canada swinging through
     the trade winds

 bound for pernambuco with a cargo of dried
     fish

 the skipper was a bluenose the mate a scan-
     dinavian

 and the crew for their numbers as mixed as
      you could wish

cooky was a frenchman from st pierre
     m iquelon

the bosn a newfoundlander who hailed
     from harbor rim

four a bs we had-a negro a dutchman
     and an irishman

 a san bias indian-and the boy was little
     jim

 the trades slackened and died away so we lay
      gently rolling

 the moon had sulked and hid her face be-
     hind a heavy cloud

 when the peace and calm were shattered by
     an eldritch wailing

 which rose up all around us-yowlings long
     and loud

 the souls of all the damned with shrieks the
     air were piercing

 unto all hands aboard that ship striking ter-
      ror and afright

 pat was on the lookout and mixed his prayers
     with cursing

the indian jumped and swam for it the
     negro turned white

 dutch said cot for dommy de vorlt he is
     a-finishing

 the bosn slapped his hairy chest the while
      his whiskers quivered

 well i neber de debbil eber seen such a wun-
      nerful perishing

 beats ahl my going a-fishing our sins be
     ahl diskivercd

and up spoke ole oleson and rum was his
     religion

if i was only boozed now how happy i
     could die

 with his bible neath his arm the skipper camc
      a-rushing

 crying im a christian man bound for man-
      sions in the sky

and amidst all the uproar where was little jim
he was perched upon the bobstay with the cat
along o him

her head and body in a bag but her tail
     a-sticking out

 which jimmy pulled and twisted and made
     poor pussy shout

sea stories

     n one of our recent issues we pub-
lished a letter from shipmate ed-
wards in which he criticized mr
fengers serial chocolate cove at
the time we did not feel that the criticism
was justified and went on record to that
effect now shipmate stephen a smith
comes aft with a letter in which he sub-
stantiates our remarks about mr fengers
serial which goes to show that you cant
please everybody mr smiths letter has
some kicks in it so you can see that he is
not a professional yes man

 as to mr smiths other remarks and
criticisms we can only say that we are
doing the best we can

  your section seems to be pretty busy lately
from the looks of the letters in the log book
but i thought that i might find room to get a
word in i noticed that you have been getting
a few knocks lately on your material and
that some of the stories that i had specially
enjoyed were coming in for their share so it
is that which is to blame for my unwarranted
trip aft

 i hope that the shipmate who said that
george allan englands captain tripp sto-
ries were trash did not discourage you from
printing more of the same i have been wait-
ing eagerly but in vain for more like rhino
elephant and gold these stories fairly swim
with real humor of the mark twain brand
and no one can deny that he is a real humor-
ist and besides mr england seems to know
his subject of ancient maya civilization any
way and he must know something of ships to
put them over the way he does

  another knock that i resented was that made
by shipmate edwards mr fengers serial
chocolate cove was the one that he did not
like but it was another of those that i espe-
cially enjoyed and which i have read at least
three times each reading being more enjoyable
than the first as a whole i think your maga-
zine is good and wish to go on record as say-
ing so

  seeing a brief history of the british bark
hougomont in one of the log books recalls the
time when she was on fire island beach  
my father worked on her discharging the chalk
she carried to lighten ship when she was pulled
off i have a piece of this chalk and a good
photograph of her while she was on the beach

  she came up so far that one was able to
board her dry shod over the pile of discharged
chalk at her side this incident recalls a lot
of other ships which ran ashore on this strip
of land which is not far from my home being
just across great south bay from this village
a list of the ships would fill this letter al-
though not a famous coast it has its own his-
story which is augmented by disasters and
drovvnings from time to time and even the
shallow bay behind it has some incidents which
might make interesting reading

  i am sorry to hear of the death of captain
kay as i surely did like his style as expressed
the log book

in blacklocks wood nymphs may he rest
well for he was a good shipmate

  one thing i would like to mention is that
the illustrators of some of the black-gang sto-
ries seem to have tried to confuse rather than
illustrate the engine and boiler-room views
which they portray most of the pipes and
valves dont seem to have any practical use
merely representing a tangled mass of machin-
ery which looks more like wreckage i won-
der if you have noticed this captain you
must have made some trips below and would
know an engine-room interior when you saw
one but i must say i never saw anything like
some of those illustrations

  well that is about enough for this trip so
ill wish you a fair wind and please dont reg-
ister the knock about the illustrations as a seri-
ous kick im merely asking your opinion so
here goes for fair winds good cargoes and
fast passages for our good ship sfa stories
for shes a real home

stephen a smith

everal months ago we published
a letter from captain morehouse
who described sailing days on the
great lakes one of our other shipmates
saw the letter and wrote to captain more-
house as we do not know the captains
address-we wrote to him ourself but
the letter was returned-we are putting
mr webers letter in these pages in the
hope that captain morehouse will see it

  while reading through the log book of sea
stories i noticed your item concerning the
schooners m o goodman and minnie slazvson
also that youve been master  all the lakes
except superior now what i would like to
know is how i can get a berth in a lake
freighter schooner or anything so long as its
a fair seagoing vessel without being made to
wait at the lake carriers hall

  ive sat in there so long that i got discour-
aged and went over to the naval recruiting sta-
tion but i couldnt make the grade there just
as i came out of the station a leatherneck
walked up to me and asked me if i wouldnt
sign up in the marines and after id told him
about my left eye he told me that i ought to
join the army for a while and get my eyesight
strengthened but i want to go to sea or on
the lakes and not in the army

  every time i go over in town the army re-
cruiting officer is after me to join well i
got more and more discouraged and i wrote
to the shipping board and i have my applica-
tion papers for deck boy but i want to ship
on the lakes this season and then i could send
in my application this coming fall for a job at
sea so if you could help me out in getting a
berth here on the lakes this season ill be
mighty thankful to you captain morehouse i
am white nineteen years of age six feet tall
weigh one hundred and eighty-five pounds and
am american born i am not a college student
but i want to make a life at sea my career and
work my way up in the profession

  i	am not afraid to work either ive had



some pretty tough jobs already some of them
were carrying a hod working lumber coal and
in tile factories i also fired a boiler when i
was fourteen so you sec sir ive experienced
plenty of tough work already and i am not
afraid of more and i realize that going to
sea is not a bed of roses wilbur weber

nn the case of some of our discus-
sions in the log book we get a
large number of letters on the same
subject sometimes we get so many let-
ters about the same thing that it is impos-
sible to publish anything like all of them
the recent case of the discussion on pit-
cairn island is a good example of what
we mean by this there were a great
many letters received in this office all deal-
ing with the same thing-the history of
pitcairn the topsail-schooner discussion
was another example our reason for
mentioning this is that we do not want
you to feel discouraged or offended if
you send us a letter and it is not printed

  our reason for making the foregoing
remarks is that the following letter is an
echo of the topsail-schooner argument
shipmate anderson as you will note sent
us a letter at that time which was not pub-
lished so we are making these remarks
to reassure him and others whose letters
did not appear in these pages

  some years ago a controversy raged in your
log book regarding the topsail-schooner rig
some gentleman claimed the rig was a phan-
tom one fostered by the imagination of some
sea writer you yourself wisely kept neutral
undoubtedly you had your reasons for doing so

  i wrote a letter to the log book at the
time explaining a topsail-schooner rig which
however you ignored allow me to state that
i have sailed in the rig in question both as
able-bodied seaman and mate so i really think
i was qualified to express an opinion on it

  at the present time a spanish navy training
ship is in port here she is docked at pier no 
 the east river perhaps you have visited
her if not you will profit by doing so as she
is a typical topsail-schooner rig

  may i say further that i have but recently
arrived from a voyage to the three scandinavian
countries and i noticed any amount of three-
masted topsail schooners there i also learned
there in april of the anxiety regarding the five-
masted bark kolmlnivn henry anderson

n reply to a recent letter requesting
information about the benjamin f
packard we submit the following
communication from winford p smith
here again you will note the popular mis-
conception about the clipper ship although
mr smith is excused by the fact that he

s


sea stories

admits to no seafaring experience there
has been some agitation in the press re-
cently about rerigging this ship and send-
ing her to sea but we seriously doubt if
it comes to anything

   noticed that shipmate brown desires in-
formation about the benjamin  packard i
have never been to sea but i am a lover of
ships and i have some meager information
about tho packard

  to the best of my knowledge she was built

in  and was originally clipper-rigged i be-
lieve she is about two hundred and twenty-five
feet over all she used to carry case oil around
the horn and was once toting lumber for a
seattle firm

  she is now owned by the sands point casino
club and t see her every day her top-hampcr
is all gone and the paint is peeling ollf her
however the hull is sound all the way through
and will probably last for many years twice
i have seen her lift with the tide and try to
get out to the sound by herself
