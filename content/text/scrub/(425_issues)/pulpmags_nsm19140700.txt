   john edward russell is one of the contributors to the new
story magazine whose work has helped perhaps as much as any
other one thing to give the magazine its wholly distinctive character

    his short stories have impressed many readers of discriminating
judgment as having a peculiarly vital and virile quality

    it is only a little while ago that a distinguished author now
living abroad wrote to us expressing himself as being amazed at
the quality of certain of the stories in this magazine and mentioned
a number of mr russells tales as possessing a psychic intensity
of treatment he added by the way that the keynote of the new
story is peculiar

    you will probably easily recall such stories of mr russells as
the last thing the keeper of the doors and the exit of
johnny fing to mention only three which will bring back to your
mind vividly the strange almost inexplicable grip with which
these stories seized upon your interest

    the quality of mr russells work that to us is most conspic-
uous is what we would call for lack of a better term its psychic
virility

    it is a strange impalpable thing hard to define chiefly because
it is something personal to the author-this color or atmosphere
which qualifies and distinguishes everything that is written every
one who writes imparts to his writing in greater or less degree
something of his own personality and this is what gives to the work
what is called atmosphere-a much abused and little understood term

    but there are only a very few authors especially of fiction who
are gifted with the ability to make this vital in their stories

    joseph conrad is one who possesses it to a very extraordinary
degree

    john edward russell is another

    this peculiar quality of mr russells work has never been
more vividly displayed than in his new novel the terror which
we begin in this number of the new story

    it is one of the most remarkable stories we have ever read if
for no other reason than for the sustained and consistent atmos-
phere which pervades it from beginning to end
ourselves

    in almost every tale of eighty to a hundred thousand words
there is apparent at certain stages a falling away of interest places
where you are conscious of a wandering of your attention

    it is usually due to the authors own lapse of interest or fatigue
and so there is a disturbance in the storys atmosphere

    nothing of this kind is noticeable in the terror its color
is solid and fast

    now when in addition to this you have a story with plot
action incident piled upon incident the drama that involves possible
catastrophes to the characters you have material for the sort of
story that human nature is always longing for

    these things mr russell has brought together in the terror

    it is frankly and undisguisedly an adventure story and while it
is of the type of stevensons treasure island and conrads
heart of darkness it is as far from being an imitation of either
of those men as it is from the work of george eliot or edith
wharton or mrs humphrey ward

    it is a story of treasure-seeking within the antarctic circle in
the gray bleak lonely regions within fifty-three degrees south-an
appropriate setting for the sort of adventure that is pictured on the
steamer colleen bawti and later on leftover island

    mr russell has revived the tradition of the port boys one
that was for years current among the traders of the south seas an
association of the vagabonds of the beaches the drifting outlawry
that used to ship and desert to rob loaf and take native wives as
the occasion served it was an organization of sea tramps that
manned the colleen bawn

    the terror is a story of twentieth-century buccaneers

    this story is a long novel but we propose to give it to you in
four installments so that you will have in each number a generous
portion of the whole story twenty thousand words at a time

    edgar wallaces story angel esquire which has brought out
many enthusiastic letters is concluded in this number

    we have planned something for the august issue to supplement
this aborbing yarn that we know will make a great big hit with you

    so be on the lookout for the new feature as well as the second
installment of the terror

a discord in avalon

by h bedford-jones

chapter i

ne to avalon thanks

     allan quentin plunged from the
ticket window and at a half run made
the gangway of the waiting cabrillo
just as the plank was being hauled in
with a laughing nod to the men he was
across the gap drew a breath of secure
relief and started forward to obtain a
seat

  there was the usual confusion of the
usual last moment with every one de-
bating as to the best seats and the
possibility of finding any seats at all
dwindling with alarming rapidity the
frown that had drawn quentins black
brows together deepened when he ob-
served that most of the passengers
shared his dislike of the sunny side of
the boat but his quick eye caught a
vacant place forward

  he beat a shivery little man to it set-
tling down with a sigh of huge satisfac-
tion and laughingly advised the refrig-
erated gentleman to take the sunny
side and thaw out whereat the other
grinned and obeyed quentin ran a
quick eye over the rest of the passen-
gers observed no one who attracted

his notice except one very large bull-
necked man in blue clothes and blue
derby and thereupon cast out every-
thing from his mind save sky and sea
and the blue-ridged catalinas ahead

  it was his first outing in three years
and he was enjoying it with his whole
soul-though he subconsciously noted
that the bull-necked man had very high
blood pressure and that two of the
tourists were undoubtedly lungers
for though quentin had left his office
and practice behind he could not leave
his profession likewise

  he had promised to meet tommy
wells and bunt green for a three days
fishing trip down the coast but it was
with some difficulty that he had gotten
away while he was a young surgeon
-as surgeons go-he was both strong
of jaw and well established in los an-
geles  having buried a few wealthy pa-
tients and cured at least one he was
made both financially and socially
tommy wells and bunt green were
social lights who had more money than
horse power and who confined them-
selves chiefly to the country club at
the catalinas where they lived a lan-
guid existence on golf and fishing and


new story magazine

scotch and kindred pursuits quentin
had cured young green of fever im-
pregnated with too much golf and
scotch and while by no means inti-
mate with the pair he saw no reason
why he should not enjoy himself at
their expense

  he gave his shoulders a little shake
looking back at receding san pedro and
flinging off all worries men said that
allan quentin was a good surgeon but
too hardened for his age yet this was
because they noted his cold gray eyes
tight mouth and rather aggressive car-
riage and utterly failed to note the
deftness of his fingers and the level
brightness of his smile

  thus far he had taken no notice of
the occupant of the chair next to his
but now his attention was attracted by
an unusual movement on the part of
the man in the blue derby whose eyes
were fastened at his side quentin eyed
the man sized him up as a detective or
plain-clothes man-then shivered slight-
ly at a light contact he glanced down
to see a hand stealthily approaching his
coat pocket

  it was a womans hand slender and
well shaped perfectly manicured and
with unexpected dimples over each
knuckle its white perfection was un-
adorned by rings although he noted a
circle on one finger which told the tale
of a ring recently removed then he
glanced at the owner of the hand

  she was leaning forward in her chair
her eyes fastened on the ocean while a
look of faint anxiety was evident in her
features her whole attitude was one
of strained concern uncertainty but
even as he looked down at her the hand
left his coat with a little sigh of re-
lief the girl settled back into her chair
the look of half-fearful worry vanished
from her face and her hand dropped
into her lap again

  quentin was thoroughly puzzled his
first thought was that she was a pick-
pocket for the catalina boats made an

excellent place in which light-fingered
gentry could ply their trade upon tour-
ists also the bull-necked man in the
blue derby was unquestionably a detec-
tive and seemed to be watching the
girl

  he looked down at her more keenly
for women whose hands went explor-
ing were not apt to resent obtrusive
stares but she seemed to have lost
all interest in him it was as though
that quick light touch on his coat had
sent flying some wandering uneasiness
-and yet the notion was absurd

  his gray eyes softened as he watched
her the face was not beautiful and
still it bore an expression of patience
which lent it indefinable sweetness to
quentin it seemed that this expression
might have been born of much suffer-
ing though she had no appearance of
ill health in spite of the frailty of her
throat and arms her oval face had a
broad brow around which rippled a
cluster of golden-brown waves of hair
and quentin suddenly found it hard to
eye her with his usual indifference to
things physical

  she had removed her hat and the sea
breeze was lifting her hair gently loos-
ing it and sending stray strands play-
ing about her cheeks a smile curved
her lips and she tossed her head back-
ward with a deep breath as if she could
not get enough of the salt-scented sun-
filled air

  then their eyes met-or quentin
thought they did and upon that his
conceit received a sudden shock for he
perceived that she was staring through
him past him as though he did not
exist he thought at first that she had
noted his detection of that stealthy
hand yet her face was quite calm and
unflushed

  well he said quietly coolly forc-
ing the issue your hand is a very
light one but i happen to be somewhat
sensitive to touch

  he received another glimpse of eys
a discord in avalon



that met his quite frankly and yet
evaded him they held a peculiar
quality in their violet depths-a quality
that caused him swift remorse at his
own words and sent unwonted sym-
pathy into his face then she gave a
quick little rippling laugh and re-
sponded 

  oh you caught me well i had to
see what kind of person you were
quentin was anything but prepared
for such frankness

  yes-but- he hesitated

  why was i feeling your coat isnt
that what you want to know

  why if you dont mind-it really
doesnt matter ygu know he stam-
mered feeling suddenly that he had
blundered she reassured him laugh-
ing softly

  you see i could tell from the feel
whether you were a gentleman or not
sorry you couldnt tell from my
face he smiled amused she turned
half away a little flicker of pain cross-
ing her own face and how did you
class me

  well she hesitated still looking
away of course i might make mis-
takes but i can often tell by the cloth

i have studied it-

  but why he insisted wondering
if she were trying to lie her way out of
a difficulty if so it was a poor effort
he thought

  cant-cant you tell why she
turned swiftly her face to his again
he felt that swift quality of her eyes
and he leaned back with a catch of his
breath

  forgive me he said quickly to
himself he added bitterly and i call
myself a surgeon

  the girl was blind

  however he had little chance to re-
flect on his own brutality as he termed
it for she leaned forward confidingly
let me look at you

  her fingers ran lightly over his face
then she settled back without comment

  well he urged smiling a little

  guess she rippled out a laugh

  upon that quentin began to make
himself agreeable she seemed to be
glad to get away from the topic of
her blindness and yet she appeared- to
sense the quick sympathy in him which
was hidden from most eyes his quiet
poise had its effect and soon she was
chatting and laughing with him listen-
ing to his description of the mountains
behind and the sharpening outlines of
the catalinas ahead with unalloyed
delight

  it puzzled him what was she doing
on this trip purely a sight-seeing one
if she was blind she was absolutely
alone also as he found by delicate ques-
tions which attained their object yet
she was well dressed and evidently a
girl of high intelligence and strong
character-and he was undeniably
puzzled

  more than once he found the eyes
of the man in the blue derby fastened
now on the girl now on himself in
an oddly irritating fashion quentin
reflected that the man was doubtless
a policeman or detective on vacation
and was not above seeking prey in the
shape of an unprotected girl for he
did not think it hard to see that the
girl was blind

  the two hours trip sped by rapidly
and long before avalon bay opened out
he had quietly determined to see that
she was cared for unless friends were
at the boat to meet her

  you explain everything so clearly
and there was a hint of sadness in her
tone when he had told her of the wharf
ahead and the boys swimming about
the ship and diving for coins and
you dont seem to weary of it

  well youre an admirable listener
he smiled how is it that youre
alone 

  she looked away and reproaching
himself instantly for a brute with some


new story magazine

fear that he would be misunderstood
by her evidently sensitive nature he
swung to the subject of the boys around
them the chatter and calls which
floated up from the youngsters were
amusing in the extreme and speedily
drew a rain of small change from the
passengers

  aw come on sport dont be a
piker loosen up old man shouted
an urchin at quentin who laughed and
tossed out a quarter there was a rush
after it a storm of spray and one
grinning youngster came up with the
coin in his cheek and a yell for more

  come it again you didnt throw
straight mister

  i do wish you could see all this
laughed quentin in the girls ear

  thank goodness i can hear it she
answered delightedly oh throw out
some more money i love to hear them
yelling and splashing

  did he get it she added quickly
feeling the sweep of quentins arm

  you bet he did-caught it in his
mouth and was yelling for another be-
fore i got my arm down he chuckled
but here we are at the wharf-may
i help you through the crowd

  is-is there a crowd she faltered
suddenly relapsing into timidity

 no except on the gangplank
theres a rule here in avalon i under-
stand that all on shore must stay be-
hind chalk lines until the steamer pas-
sengers are unloaded and have a chance
to decide where they want to go are
your friends to meet you

  i-i-no i think not she replied
her hands twisting at her handkerchief
then she had turned lightly to him
laughing again oh ive so longed
to come here do take me ashore if
it wont be too much trouble

  ill be delighted he replied gravely
he wondered however why she was
so delighted at the trip perhaps her
overacute senses gave her some percep-

tion of the things about her after all

come

  he guided her to the rear of the
crowd which was streaming thinly
down the gangway ahead of them
were the clamoring guides and touts
and fishermen staying well back of
their chalked lines while beyond these
were the narrow streets rising against
the hill with the sun-blue sky and bay
striking back the gorgeous hues on
every hand he looked down at the
girls face andsaw it quivering with
delight it was as if she actually felt
the color of everything and the hand
that rested on his arm was trembling

  would-would it be imposing on
you-she half turned to him-if i
asked you to take me to the metropole
after that ill be all right for my
friends did not expect me you see-

  its a pleasure he reassured her
admiring her nerve in making this trip
by herself if she had riends at the
hotel she would soon be in good hands
though he felt a little thrill of disap-
pointment at the idea of not seeing her
again

  a burly form shoved past him and
he saw it was the man in the blue derby
who was making his way out to the
end of the plank quentin and the girl
pressed forward in his track and a
moment later were standing at the edge
of the throng

  since there was no mistaking the
big hotel he took her arm and they
started toward the gate there how-
ever he saw the man in the blue derby
standing watching them and his anger
began to rise if the fellow was trying
to enjoy himself quentin decided that
he would get a lesson shortly on the
other hand he suddenly thought the
man might have been set to keep watch
from afar on the girl her friends might
like to give her the impression of free-
dom yet keep a careful guard over her

as they came to the gate however
quentin lost this impression quickly
a discord in avalon



the detective if such he was stepped
forward with a sharp glance at quen-
tin and caught the girls arm

  just a minute miss he said
roughly id like to know your name

chapter ii

  quentin caught the mans hand and
flung it off curtly

  what does this mean my man
he asked his gray eyes very cold the
other flushed then nodded his head at
the startled girl

  no offense mister-im bert os-
good from los angeles headquarters
is this young lady a friend of yours

  yes replied quentin seeing that
he had misjudged his man

  let me have your names please-
im on a little job over here but if ive
made a mistake i aint meaning no of-
fense

  there vyas evident hesitation in the
detectives manner and he had spoken
so softly that the girl had plainly heard
nothing beyond that first startling sen-
tence quentin thought swiftly he did
not know the girls name but through
his mind raced one that he had heard
on dolly burlingtons lips and he seized
on it to be rid of the man

  this is miss enid elsmere and im
doctor allan quentin of los angeles
its all right officer-i guess you
dropped on the wrong party

  the detectives black eyes swept
across his face then the man nodded
and drew back with a gesture of apol-
ogy- quentin took the girls arm again
and quietly led her through the crowd

  whats the matter she asked
looking up at him who was that
man 

  quentin searched desperately for
some answer that would satisfy her
without causing her needless alarm

  just a beggar he lied easily and
his voice was convincing its all
right

he motioned the crowding touts
away and when they had passed be-
yond the mob he found her gazing at
him with apparent wonder on her face

  but how in the world did you know
my name she asked simply

  quentin gasped your name

  certainly i heard you tell-

  i said your name was enid els-
mere for iack of a better my own
name i gave

then you are doctor quentin
why of course he laughed for
there was wonder in her face but
you dont mean to say that your name
is really enid elsmere

  yes she said softly then drew
closer on his arm but cant we get
to the hotel and then talk this is
too-too public and she glanced
around or seemed to do so nervously
you have helped me and i feel that
i owe you an explanation-and i would

like more help-

  come nalong he said briefly and
determined that she was the best liar
he had ever met he did not know
who the real elsmere girl was except
that she was some acquaintance of
dolly burlington but if this blind girl
had ben in fear of a detective if she

had really been exploring his pocket-

  rot he said to himself looking
down at her face this may be the
long arm of coincidence after all

  he guided her up the steps into the
big building waving off the clustering
bell boys and led her across the palm-
strewn lobby to a rather secluded cor-
ner where he placed her in a chair and
dropped into another at her side

  now he began quietly tell me
who enid elsmere is please

  he saw that her hands were twist-
ing nervously at her handkerchief again

  are you a friend of doctor bur-
lington please have you heard him
speak of me

  quentin looked hard at her startled
in turn


new story magazine

  no miss elsmere i know hall
burlington slightly but i know his
daughter dolly quite well i have
heard her speak of an enid elsmere
as an acquaintance that is all

  oh there seemed to be relief
in her tone which puzzled him does
dolly call you quent

  she does he replied in new won-
der and she hesitated again what
could it mean  why had he never
heard of enid elsmere except in such
a superficial way that the name had
never provoked a question

 then you are- she stopped

wit a furious blush and he laughed
out

  no miss elsmere im sorry youve
heard gossip but dolly is really in love
with another man and were just play-
ing the game to keep mrs burlington
contented pro tem dollys a good
chum and im helping her out but
you havent told me who you are
im doctor burlingtons niece she
answered in a low voice

  quentin felt his suspicions revolve
again he had known of burlington
for years first as an indifferent physi-
cian living on indifferent means and
later with wealth from some unknown
source leaping into prominence socially
and professionally-a quiet heavy-
jawed man who talked little mrs bur-
lington he knew well had huge am-
bitions for dolly which he was help-
ing dolly to defeat but he had never
heard of a niece

  i did not know he had a niece
he said quietly miss elsmere if you
are in any difficulty i wish you would
allow me to help you why are you
over here alone surely the burling-
tons who live at long beach would
have been glad to meet you

  there was trouble in her sightless
face and she hesitated again

  i-i have lived with them for three
years she said slowly if you were

not a friend of my uncles i would
be more ready to trust you

  quentin stared at her thunderstruck
it occurred to him that she was clever
she might have known of the burling-
ton family she might have seized at
a straw and made it into a rope-but
it was hard to believe surely there
was nothing about hall burlington to
inspire those last bitter words of hers

  my dear girl he said finally i
am merely an acquaintance of-of your
uncle if you are in any trouble you
may tell me in professional confidence
even if i said that i hoped never
to enter his door again she shot out
with swift and passionate intentness

  by jove whistled quentin to him-
self this is getting in deep aloud
he reassured her briefly i make no
reservation miss elsmere

  i will trust you then if you will
see that i am taken to mr j m
mathews who has a summer residence
here on the island and if you will prom-
ise not to reveal my whereabouts for
at least two months will you 
where such a promise is necessary
it is seldom safe to trust he responded
none the less i promise and i will
be very glad to help you

  her hand fluttered to his arm in re-
lief then fell to her lap again

  then i will tell you she said sim-
ply as a child three years ago i
was left in care of doctor burlington
he is not really my uncle though i
have always called him so i think he
was a college mate of my fathers
when i was orphaned it was arranged
that doctor burlington should have the
use of my income and should bring
me up as his own daughter

  this went well for the first year but
after that conditions grew insupport-
able doctor quentin i am of age
yet he controls my money unless my
sight should be restored which he as-
sures me is impossible he has kept
me secluded and although dolly and i
a discord in avalon



love each other dearly not even she
is allowed to mention me to visitors
people understand that there is an
invalid in the house perhaps but no
more even dolly seems to think that
her father is acting for the best-oh it
is terrible

  she paused her voice breaking
quentin was biting his lips in helpless
bewilderment at this strange story
truth of which seemed patent in her
face and voice his doubts had vanished
utterly and as he thought of burling-
ton in this new light the thing began
to assume probability

  the mathews she went on are
the only people who take any interest
in me for they were friends of my
fathers also  doctor burlington has
assured them that my sight cannot be
restored but i intend to make a fight
for it-mr mathews will help me
when he understands everything for
hes a very fine lawyer but you are

a doctor-do you think-

  i do not know miss elsmere re-
plied quentin very gravely i am not
an eye specialist and burlington is

really a good physician-

  but dont you see she burst out
he wants my money-as long as i
am blind hell have the use of it and
hell keep me blind

  great scott exclaimed quentin
look here miss elsmere this thing

cant-

  he paused for the dumb anguish
in her face convinced him he found
his hand trembling and shook himself
together recalling burlingtons sudden
wealth and consequent rise in the world
he began to believe her

  i cant tell you anything without
a careful examination he went on
slowly but have you no proof of
this thing

  none she shook her head except
my own convictions and things my
uncle has let drop from time to time-
but nothing definite when i slipped

out of the house this morning i met
some man in the street who steered
me to the electric station and helped
me on a san pedro car the rest was
easy but mr mathews will take care
of me and i do wish you would look
at my eyes i feel that i can trust
you-

  she broke off and he patted her hand
quietly soothingly

  later miss elsmere i promise you
that i will do so for the present the
main thing is to get into touch with
fliese mathews people and ill soon
see about that i am to mee a couple
of friends at the country club this
afternoon so as its barely noon now
ill find out where the mathews people
are well have lunch here then after
the mathews take care of you ill be
off to the club t m mathews isnt
it

  yes james mortimer

  all right wait here a moment
he walked over to the desk and
smilingly waved back the pen shoved
at him by the desk clerk

  no ill only be here for lunch and
we dont care to register do you know
where a j m mathews lives on the
island

   yes sir-youll find it quite a little
walk but easy to locate just off buena
vista park if you walk the paths
pretty steep but you can go up by the
incline railway just as well its the
only residence up there and mr
mathews only built last winter after
giving up his legal work in the city
anything i can do for you

  no thank you i merely want to
know where the house is

  quentin turned but as he started
across the lobby he saw the burly form
of osgood the headquarters man
come up and lean over the counter
talking to the clerk he saw the latter
fling a quick look in his direction but
it was improbable in the extreme that
they were speaking of him so he re-

turned to his charge it was agreed
that as she was tired he would leave
her at the hotel after lunch while he
brought mathews down to take care of
her since he could meet his friends at
the club any time that afternoon

  so without forebodings he passed
in to a very happy luncheon

chapter iii

  after lunching quentin obtained a
room-for his charge and left her at
the elevator in charge of a maid
then getting a telephone booth he
called up the club found that both
tommy wells and bunt green were
on the links and left word that he
would arrive about five whereupon
with the afternoon before him he left
the hotel and walked down crescent
avenue with no more worry upon his
mind than enid elsmere

  she however provided worry
enough when he had passed the pub-
lic gardens and the greek theater and
had swung aboard the little railway car
which would lift him to the park above
he had almost reached the conclusion
that her incredible story was a lie

  he had known dolly burlington for
years but the intimacy between them
had been only a firm friendship yet
it seemed impossible that he should not
have known-hold on had not dolly
written him while he was in his senior
year at stanford that her father had
been appointed ward of an invalid girl
if she had the memory was hazy but
once it had lodged the thought could
not be shaken off

  he had spent a year in europe
partly in study partly in care of a
wealthy paralytic and it was possible
that these changes had come about in
his absence in the two years since
his return he had been fairly busy es-
tablishing himself in los angeles had
had little time to spend with the bur-
lingtons at long beach and dolly had

been too much occupied with her own
love affair to do other than accept a
situation to which she must have be-
come accustomed-providing enid els-
meres story was true

  upon that the car had stopped
quentin who had never visited the cat-
alinas before in common with most
people who lived close by obtained his
direction from the conductor and made
his way along the edge of the buena
vista grounds

  presently he came upon the place he
sought-a snug home built in swiss
chalet style on the mountainside and
having a gpodly private garden even
though it was set so near the park
grounds that it seemed almost a part
of them observing that a wide
veranda opening off the hillside had
as much the appearance of a front
entrance to the house as the stone steps
which led up from a lower level of
walk quentin chose the former route
walked the length of the veranda and
rang at the side door

  his ring brought no response and
he pressed the bell again and again
at length he was just turning in dis-
gust when there came a shuffling step
the door was opened and a wizened
old man looked at him curiously

  well 

  id like to see mr mathews an-
swered quentin

  not to hum sir

  mrs mathews then he said won-
dering if there were a mrs mathews

  no sir they aint nobody to hum
cepting me

  well where are they then ive
got to see mr mathews or one of the
family as soon as possible quentin
felt an absurd impulse to laugh at the
little old man who was plainly im-
pressed with the importance of being
left in charge of the place

  im right sorry sir and the care-
taker scratched his head but i aint
sure when theyll be back both on em
a discord in avalon



went in on the eight-oclock boat this
momin and if they stay over in los
angeles for a show to-night they aint
liable to git hum right sudden may
be back to-night mebbe to-morrow
sorry sir

  since there was no help for it quen-
tin beat a retreat in no little consterna-
tion this unexpected turn of affairs
left him somewhat up a tree he re-
flected as planned the fishing ex-
pedition was to leave avalon that night
for a point thirty miles down the coast
where three days would be spent fish-
ing he decided that he would go up
to the club later in the afternoon
arrange to meet the other two men
when they came down to embark and
trust to luck that mathews would be
back

  if he isnt he thought ill have
to chuck the fishing trip thats all
and i guess id better do it anyhow
id sooner spend a few hours with that
blind girl than with a couple of boozing
millionaires even with the fishing
thrown in

  reaching the metropole again he
went direct to the girls room and the
maid admitted him he reported the
issue of his mission briefly

  now he concluded in his cheeriest
professional tone would you like to
rest this afternoon or would a trip
to the submarine gardens interest you 
oh by all means her suddenly
eager face fell but i must not de-
tain you doctor quentin its been

very good of you to-

  nonsense he laughed my dear
miss elsmere i have positively nothing
on hand more than a run up to the
country club later in the afternoon
and well be back before three as the
tourists must catch the last boat back
to pedro so come along if youre
sure you dont need rest

  rest she cried a passion of long-
ing in her voice anything rather
than this uncertainty it seems as

though id done nothing but just rest
for years and years and if youll tell
me about the gardens ill be perfectly
happy

  that settled it to quentins entire
satisfaction ten minutes later they
went down but as they crossed the
lobby to the street stairs quentin saw
the figure of osgood leaning against
the desk once more reflecting that
the detective was no doubt waiting for
the afternoon boat home he dismissed
the matter altogether

  together with a crowd of sight-seers
they piled into one of the sunk-bot-
tomed launches and were soon on their
way quentin found that his task was
a light one since the spieler called out
through his megaphone what the ob-
jects were beneath the glass cockpit
and the surgeon had only to amplify
what was said they passed sugar
loaf and moonstone beach and quen-
tin realized to his own surprise that
the intent eagerness of the girl beside
him was drawing him on into a color
phrasing of words that he had not
known he possessed

  she impressed him strangely as she
sat with her sightless eyes fixed on the
glass square beneath them the cramp
in his own neck as he leaned over the
railing was becoming pronounced why
then did she assume the same position
which was of no value to her with
that however he remembered the sen-
sitiveness of the blind and wondered
no longer she merely wished to attract
no attention or comment

  he considerately kept his voice low-
ered as he leaned beside her and while
a few of the other passengers undoubt-
edly took them for a honeymoon couple
quentins hard gray eye cured them
instantly of any knowing smiles that
might have lingered

  what are the abalone shells like
she asked as a diver went over the bow

  concave shells iridescent and glit-
tering they are beautiful enough be-


new story magazine

neath the water but lose most of their
color here ill take two of those
he added raising his voice as the diver
came up dripping almost beside him
with four or five shells for sale among
the tourists

  her childlike glee over the wet shells
and the way she clapped one to either
ear touched him strangely she had all
the frank gayety of a child yet she had
told him that she was twenty-one and
when he looked at her and saw what
little impress her affliction had upon
her quentin began to feel a slow anger
rising against doctor hall burlington
suddenly while she kept the shells over
her ears entranced he became aware
of two men talking at his side and
the first words gripped him

  yep-blind as a bat if any one
catches her slick dodge aint it
they say shes the slickest dip ever
kept out o court too shes been
workin the catalina boats off and on
but i expect theyve put the cops after
her too late as usual shes probly
beat it-by jolly aint that pretty now
the speaker leaned over silent for
a moment as the boat passed over a
vale of feathery swaying blue sea vio-
lets interwoven with feather-boa kelp
and shells and the flicker of darting fish
but quentin sat motionless his mind
in a whirl until the second man took
up the thread of conversation the
girl still listened to her shells

  does the pitiful help-the-blind
stunt if she gets caught eh

  not by a blame sight dresses like
a lady they say-if a guy nabs her
shes made a mistake and thats all
cept the apologies

  some class eh commented the
other well there aint any blind
game going to work on me thats sure
i aint got much but i need it moren

other folks-

  where are we passing now
quentin heard the murmur at his ear
and turned to find the girl waiting for

him to continue his talk with a tre-
mendous effort he forced his mind free
of what he had heard but the beauty
of the trip was spoiled for him and
he was glad when at length they turned
back to avalon once more

  none the less although he managed
to maintain his usual attitude there was
an undercurrent running through his
brain which it was hard to quell what
had that conversation meant there
was one way to find out and when
they had reached the hotel again he
took it promising to return for din-
ner he left enid at her room and vis-
ited the desk clerk bluntly asking him
if it was a fact that a woman pickpocket
was working the boats and if she
played blindness when detected the
clerk eyed him a little queerly he
thought then nodded with a laugh

  of course were keeping it dark
sir but i think that theres no more
danger shes not known by sight but
the bulls have a good description and
unless she beats it pretty quick theyll
nab her this is on the quiet you un-
derstand sir

  certainly thank you nodded
quentin and passed out on his way to
the country club his-mind a whirl-
wind of conflicting doubts was enid
elsmere the pickpocket

  she had heard that name from his
lips and had promptly related a most
incredible story concerning a man of
unblemished social and professional
standing what was more he had swal-
lowed it whole with but a slight
knowledge of hall burlingtons family
she might easily have fabricated the
whole thing and over against this he
could only set his knowledge of human
nature the appeal of her blind face and
her whole manner-but was she blind

  by heavens thought quentin his
lips tightening id stake a good deal
on that face of hers and yet-

  the doubt crawled and twisted like
a maggot and he could not down it
a discord in avalon



if she had seen the detective on the
boat she might have played a desper-
ate hand to win but he was forced to
admit that it had been magnificently
played despite the craziness of her
story what would her ultimate intent
be in that case

  it was not hard to guess at pres-
ent she was vouched for by him-
though he was unknown on the islands
-and had found shelter at the hotel
if his doubts were well founded she
would remain there until the afternoon
boat back to san pedro then she would
quietly slip off and beat it

  all right decided quentin as he
swung up the last few yards of metro-
pole avenue passed the tennis courts
and on to the country club ill not
return until the boat has gone back
itll be pretty good proof that shes
told the truth if i find her waiting
well leave the matter on the knees
of the gods until then

  as he turned up the steps of the
clubhouse he felt in his hip pocket for
his bill fold and cardcase which con-
tained the greater part of his money
then he stopped suddenly and went
through his other pockets

  the wallet was gone

chapter iv

  there came a rush of feet a vocifer-
ous burst of voices and quentin was
hilariously pulled up to the cool
veranda by the two men who had
rounded the clubhouse walk golf bags
in hand

  youre a nice one to give us the slip
like that cried bunt green forcing
him into a singapore chair while
tommy wells sent a steward clatter-
ing away after drinks think youre
kind of privileged because youve a few
initials after your name eh cut it
out doc cut it out-do you get me 
quentin forced himself into coher-
ence he saw that the pair of them

had been dividing punishment between
golf balls and scotch according to their
wont and he felt suddenly as if he
had stepped into unclean waters

  not by about umpty miles bunt
he returned looking at his challenger
with the calm deliberation of one who
understands his fellow man even though
he misses the drift of things sorry

i missed the early boat fellows-

  green interrupted him with a roar
of laughter while tommy wells with
the flabby chops on either side of his
double chin dancing with mirth leaned
over the table and howled wells was
a bit past the talking stage but bunt
green winked in a wisely understand-
ing way and slapped quentin on the
back with another roar

 zow-wee did you get that
tommy dont he look like an inno-
cent little lamb though just like little
willy when he says i didnt did it
and wipes the jam off his nose

  you-youzh make him flush wish
-wish shame blurted wells thickly
but it was resentment and not shame
that drove the red into quentins face

  come across boys he urged easily
making the best of it throw me a
line for im on the rocks

  he felt there was something behind
this that he could not understand
innoshence abroad-hie-innoshence

- began wells then slumped back

in his chair as the steward brought the
drinks quentin waved him away im-
patiently

  say whats the matter with you
chaps he inquired calmly wells
youll go off with a snap one of these
days ive warned you already about
drinking as you do with your high
blood pressure

  oh tommys all right grinned
bunt green lighting a cigarette with
an unpleasant twinkle in his eye in-
nocence abroad is right doc didnt
suppose that we might take it into our
heads to meet that boat did you  they


new story magazine

do say this is a great little ol place
for a honeymoon

  whos-whos zhe skirt inquired
wells heavily leering

  in a flash quentin understood-and
the comprehension was sickening to
him the mere thought of enid els-
mere pickpocket or no in connection
with these sodden scions of wealth was
repulsive to him

  i think youd better explain your-
selves he said dangerously quiet

  still playing the game like a little
man complimented bunt with mock
ceremony he made a wabbly curtsy
which drew another howl of laughter
from his friend waved his cigarette
somewhat unsteadily and winked again
oh dont bother to explain old man
you see we met that boat-and thats
all

  sure thash all repeated wells
vaguely spilling half his manhattan
over his white flannels and laughing
again at himself

  quentin had tried to contain his
anger but the half-veiled inference
drove his gray eyes hard and cold he
regretted his hasty acceptance of the
invitation to this visit from men he
hardly knew yet he could not have
foreseen this exact occurrence

  i think you two chaps had better
get a couple of brain dusters instead
of more whisky he said coldly if

were going to-

  look here and green lrew him-
self up with the swift exasperation of
a good-natured man more than a little
under the influence do you mean to
insinuate that im not sober doc
no returned quentin bluntly i
mean to insinuate that youre just about
plain drunk green if youre going
fishing to-night youd better get to bed
for a few hours and get a bit sobered
up same to you wells

  wells laughed vacantly but green
flung his cigarette over the railing and

got shakily to his feet anger in his
face

  youre drunk yourself doc youre
blind drunk and im going to put you
to bed-

  shut up you fool broke in quen-
tin roughly-as another party of golfers
passed their table with curious glances

  for answer green caught the whisky
bottle from the table and swung it full
at him quentin rdse from his chair
caught the wildly swinging arm saved
the bottle and then very determinedly
flung green down into his chair where
he lay gasping for air he turned to
the hurrying stewards

  youd better take care of mr green
and mr wells at once he said quietly
then turned and walked off

  wait implored wells trying to
rise wait doc-i shay ol man-

  quentin strode back to the street
unheeding and drew a long breath
he felt as though he needed cleansing
before going back to enid elsmere

  the thought stopped him like a blow
what was he to do it seemed to be
a cold certainty that she was not only
the pickpocket in question but that she
had neatly touched him for most of
his money he had ten or twelve dol-
lars left but no more

  by george though i cant believe
it he cogitated walking slowly along
yet the thing fits together so dam-
nably  her hand was at my coat pocket
when i first noticed her and if she
had been stalling to remove my sus-
picion she couldnt have done it better
than she did then she caught at the
name i gave osgood-and it sure took
a lot of work to get the stkry out of
her she either made it up on the
spot which seems most likely all things
considered or else she was telling gods
truth im blest if i know what to
believe

  with that he sat down on a bench
to think it over glancing at his watch
a discord in avalon



he found that he had half an hour
before the last boat left for the main-
land unless he was to catch it he
must stay overnight and twelve dol-
lars would hardly stand the strain of
two rooms at the metropole yet if
his doubts were correct she would not
wait for his return-and then there was
the mathews affair which might have
been a lie also

  oh lord  he groaned dropping his
head and staring at the ground what
kind of a balled-up ruddy mess have
i stumbled into if i convict her in
my own mind and skip out for home
my conscience will prick forever after
if that impossible tale of hers is true
she needs help mighty badly i think
id sooner be taken for an easy mark
though and lose a little coin in the
process than be scared out of helping
a person who might be in need of me
well what do i stand to lose anyhow 

  his money was gone in any case in
half an hour he could return to the
hotel and if the girl had slipped away
he would simply take her room till the
morning for he had enough money left
to cover it if she was still there it
would be a fairly sure indication that
his suspicions were unjust for she
would hardly remain to meet the
mathews unless she was sure of her
ground in which case mathews could
foot the bills

  quentin shook his head hopelessly
as he remembered that his only means
of identifying himself should need arise
lay in that missing bill fold that con-
tained his cards money and letters
however he had nothing worse in pros-
pect than an overnight stay on the
island

  ill do it he said rising at last
ill let the gods decide if shes at
the hotel ill give her eyes a test or
two and abide by the result and ill
go the limit too-ill neither think
wrong of her nor say wrong of her
and if that confounded bull shows up

again ill give him something to think
about

  with that he flung back his shoul-
ders-and found the detective osgood
coming toward him with calculating eye
quentin paused angry at himself and
at the man but osgood nodded coolly
and confidently

  sorry to trouble you doc-say is
that miss elsmere with you a blind
lady

  she is returned quentin coldly
she is also a relative-

  he stopped suddenly if the girls
story were true no word must get out
of her relationship to hall burlington
at least until she had been placed with
friends osgood stared at him curi-
ously

  yes

  shes a relative of friends of mine
and in my care professionally con-
tinued quentin why are you inter-
ested in her do you take her for
that woman pickpocket

  well id take her in all right if
it wasnt for you grinned osgood
o course your word goes with me
doc you aint got a card with you

  quentin laughed despite himself and
reported the loss of his pocketbook
to remove any possibility of suspicion
remaining he went on to say that miss
elsmere could be identified by mr
mathews at which the other nodded

  all right sir all right ill report
that pocketbook of yours-sorry you
got stung doc it was probly on the
launch while you was looking over the
rail well much obliged and sorry i
troubled you

  quentin nodded then wondered how
osgood had known he was on the
launch-unless the detective had been
trailing him he looked after the man
who was going on up the avenue and
then thoughtfully continued his way
down the hill

  the last steamer of the day had gone
and it was with no little suspense that


new story magazine

he requested the desk clerk to call up
miss elsmeres room with his name

  go right up doctor came the an-
swer and quentin walked to the ele-
vator with a song in his heart the die
was cast-a simple test or two and he
would doubt no more

  she greeted him with outstretched
hands her maid remaining in the al-
covelike bedroom and the frank de-
light in her face was so wholly unas-
sumed that quentins heart smote him
he found that she was tired and pre-
ferred talking quietly to going forth
upon the island again and she was
genuinely glad to hear that his fishing
trip had been unavoidably called off
and that he could remain with her

  so dismissing the maid he took her
down to the palm-shaded corner in the
lobby where they sank into the soft
chairs and talked he not only made
one or twosimple tests such as pass-
ing his finger close before her eyes but
he also told her of the loss of his
pocketbook and frankly asked if she
had any money her childish ripple of
laughter disarmed his last suspicions
and she smilingly replied that she had
ten dollars which satisfied quentin that
for the night at least they would be
able to pull through

  while they talked during the hour
that remained before dinner time she
told him more of her story and of her
life under the roof of doctor burling-
ton the fact that she was of age
mattered nothing for as a dependent
the physician had been given the cus-
tody of her person and the use of her
income while an appeal to the courts
would of course result in her release
she had been kept in rather gilded seclu-
sion burlington evidently knowing
nothing of the clear incisive brain
which lay behind her broad brows

  i wonder now that i had the cour-
age-or rather that i never had the
courage to slip away before she said
finally it is so good of you to help

me-and i am so sorry that i must be
such a burden upon you-

  never mind that returned quentin
soothingly well take a stroll to the
mathews cottage to-night and if they
havent come back ill leave a note tell-
ing of your presence here unless they
return to-night or in the morning were
apt to have trouble i fancy burling-
ton will trace you here easily enough
through the men who helped you at
long beach and san pedro-but dont
worry he added quickly as her face
shadowed over ive three days of
freedom ill wire my housekeeper for
money to-night and well soon tumble
your worthy uncle off his high horse

  so having quite restored her cheer-
ful optimism he tucked her hand under
his arm and they went in to dinner
together-for dinner clothes have little
place in avalon

  well what will you have to start
with he smiled picking up the carte

  anything plebeian and understanda-
ble she retorted you order please

  certainly he answered mentally
thanking himself that he had learned
the trick of ordering for a fair com-
panion dolly had been wont to assure
him that a woman could not help ador-
ing a man who could order fittingly
without questioning her-and he smiled
to himself at the thought he was be-
ginning to wish that enid elsmere
could take a lesson or two in adoration
from dolly burlington

 having ordered he laid aside the
crd-and looked up to see bert os-
good calmly sitting three tables away
apparently paying them no attention
whatever but it suddenly occurred to
quentin that if this blind girl were in
reality afraid of justice she could find
no better refuge than the hotel metro-
pole sheltered as the patient of a sur-
geon of some little repute

  with a little shock he crushed the
thought down sternly and a song rose
once more in his heart at the smile
a discord in avalon



of the girl-woman who sat across the
table and gazed at him with eyes that
saw not

chapter v

  more than once it seemed to quentin
that the girl was on the point of making
some confidence-hinted at by the fleet-
ing expression of her face not by any
words more than once he saw her
glance in the direction of the detectives
table as though she sensed the presence
of some disturbing factor

i hope well find mathews there to-
night he said finally when dinner was
all but finished burlington will be
over by the morning if hes traced you
swift alarm shot into her face

 then-if i dared-

  well he smiled as she paused
abruptly is there anything you have
not told me miss elsmere

  yes--i-no and the struggle in
her face was gone no doctor i

must play out the game-

 what do you mean he leaned
forward wondering what lay behind
those words you can trust me ab-
solutely miss elsmere

  oh it is not that indeed but my
-my uncle must not see me

  he shall not believe me and
quentin settled back in his chair after
all her agitation at burlingtons name
was quite natural he told himself yet
-what if burlington should prove to
be in the right if the girl had a brain
tumor it was possible that her sight
could be restored but as he watched
those violet eyes quentin found it hard
to believe that enid elsmere was either
so afflicted or was even blind at times
the fixed vacant expression was lost
in her face and in those moments the
violet eyes seemed to be scanning him
reading his very thoughts it was un-
canny and to quiet his doubts he rose

  i must send a telegram and get a
room here so if youll wait ill be back

in a moment and we can start out for
the mathews place

  she nodded smilingly and quentin
departed to the lobby here he regis-
tered got a room not far from that
of enid and sent a wire to his house-
keeper instructing her to wire him
twenty dollars that night without fail
so with his immediate future provided
for he returned to the dining room
and in ten minutes left the hotel with
enid on his arm

  as he helped her into the car at the
incline he forgot that conversation on
the glass-bottomed launch the loss of
his pocketbook and his fleeting doubts
she settled near him with a shivery
fear as the car began to lift

  why it seems like-like some of
me was missing she gasped as if
it had suddenly left me alone and i
wanted it right back

  what a queer child you are he
laughed joyously holding her arm in
his

  how-am i different from other
girls 

  she laughed a little as though the
idea were not half unpleasant and
quentin wondered it swiftly occurred
to him that such a thought should have
been terribly jarring on the sensitive
nerves of a blind girl-or so at least
he would have supposed

  confound it he exclaimed men-
tally here i am doubting again
he resolutely cast all doubts from him
and answered her question with a con-
fident pressure on her arm

  youre different miss elsmere and
im glad of it you can give cards
to all the girls i ever knew and then
beat them the only thing they have
on you is sight and that you may re-
gain i trust

  do you think i can she turned
her face to him eagerly and quentin
saw that her eyes were wide set as
though she were looking through and
beyond him it struck him to the heart


new story magazine

  i do not know he made earnest
answer careful not to raise any false
hopes i know of only one cause for
such blindness and that would be a
small brain tumor which could be re-
moved easily only a very careful ex-
amination can determine

  with that the car stopped and he
helped her out he paused a moment
holding her hand in his

  please promise me one thing that
you will take the thought of regaining
your sight very quietly miss elsmere
by upsetting your nervous system you

can impair any good i might be-

  i thought you said where it was
necessary to extract a promise it wasnt
safe to trust she asked laughing a
little he saw that her poise had been
regained and smiled at the waj she
had turned his words on himself

  surely she went on more gravely
i will do all i can fo help doctor it
is entirely to my own interest to do so
he could not help wondering at her
calmness and he admired her the more
for it at the edge of the park they
paused while he stood looking down
at the moonlit view beneath and de-
scribed it to her the curving bay
with its white-sailed yachts and other
swarming craft the little city of avalon
with its gleaming lights and farther on
sugar loaf and bachelor point she
responded to his words as if she felt
the utter beauty of the scene then
caught at his arm suddenly

  listen there is music

  he turned and caught the first notes
of the band concert floating up from
the greek theater in the valley below
it was la paloma they played and
quentin suddenly decided that the air
was not so hackneyed after all indeed
this girl on his arm seemed to him
not a little like a helpless dove-and
to curb the sentimental influence of
the night and the thought he led her
to a seat close by

  physicians orders-moonlight and

music he laughed ten to one the
mathews people will be doing likewise
if theyve come home if not theres
no hurry

  she did not answer he saw that she
was content to rest and listen to the
music and he himself was far too well
satisfied to disturb her the moonlight
softened her face remarkably deepen-
ing its shadows until he could see only
the strong curves of brow and nose
and chin

  hardly speaking they sat for a short
half hour while the moon rose higher
and lost its warm early glow quen-
tins reverie was interrupted suddenly
when she laid her hand on his arm
without turning to him

  come

  he looked down at her wrist and
caught the glint of a silver bracelet
watch with two initials set over against
the dial in brilliants he stiffened sud-
denly then spoke

  why are the initials m p on this
bracelet miss elsmere they are not
yours 

  she started but turned a perfectly
calm face to his

  no-the bracelet was given me by
a friend mary palmer three years ago
she set her own initials in it so that i
-i would not forget her

  despite the quiet words quentin had
a helpless feeling that the explanation
was lame but he savagely forced down
the thought though he stored away that
name in his mind and without com-
ment led her along toward the mathews
cottage

  as they drew closer to it he saw
with no little dismay that the house
was dark and seemingly empty turn-
ing in at the gate he led enid up the
path though he found that she was
wonderfully apt at evading trees and
bushes even without his warnings
when they reached the side entrance
quentin pushed at the bell in vain
though he could distinctly hear the faint
a discord in avalon



answering ring there was no doubt
of it the mathews had not returned

  nor was the caretaker in evidence
quentin usually carried a small pocket
electric flash lamp and after seating the
girl in one of the porch chairs he drew
it out and flashed it swiftly over the
door no all was closed and screened
and the sight of the girls silent despair
when he told her the result caused him
to do some swift thinking

  the failure of mathews to return
home was annoying in the extreme he
cogitated and it might easily prove
much more burlington was not apt
to have great difficulty in tracing the
girl and he could either take the regu-
lar morning boat to the islands or else
he would get a launch from long beach
and come over in that case every
moment would count

  i can bluff burlington or lead him
off the trail he reflected but id bet-
ter leave a note here telling mathews
to get down to the hotel on the jump
he might gain time by coming over
in one of the long beach boats since
hes coming from los angeles i guess
ill do that

  so taking the girls hand in his he
placed the flash lamp in her palm and
set her finger on the button

  if youll hold that just so ill write
a note to your friend and leave it and
we can get back to the hotel he said
and since it was necessary for her to
hold the light steady he was slow in
loosing her hand-quite unaccountably
so in fact the contact thrilled him
very pleasantly then with the
thought that he was taking advantage
of her implicit trust he stepped away
and explored his pockets for paper and
pencil

  finding an old prescription blank
he scribbled a hasty note merely tell-
ing mathews that his presence was
urgently needed at the hotel by miss x
enid elsmere ana asking him to lose
not a moment in getting there sign-


ing the paper he read over the note
to the girl for her approval

  that will do nicely she said with
a decisive nod where will you put
it  is there a mail box 

  nothing doing in that line he
chuckled the mail box is back at
the front gate ill open the door or
else slip it under

  taking the light from her he flashed
it over the door again but found the
outer screen door fastened as the
opening was tight he drew out his
pocketknife and without trouble in-
serted the blade so that the catch raised
and he swung the screen back

  if my friend osgood could see me
now he chuckled inwardly hed be
apt to run me in on general principles
i guess

  as he expected he found the inner
door locked so he stooped over and
slipped the note inside and rose with
a feeling of relief after all burling-
ton might not be over in the morning
and mathews would be easily able to
handle the legal difficulties of the girls
situation in any case he himself had
three days to spare and he could re-
main and take care of enid if neces-
sary

  i feel unaccountably like a thief
he laughed under his breath as he
flashed the light across the door again
and closed the screen

  it does feel silent and deserted
she shivered a little

  he put away his flash lamp and was
just turning to take her arm when an-
other stream of light shot full into his
face blinding him he stood in as-
tounded surprise and involuntarily his
hand went to his pocket in search of
his own light again but a deep voice
halted him abruptly

  hands up there-quick
protruding across the ray of light
quentin saw the ugly barrel of an auto-
matic with the hand holding it the
sharp light blinded him to all behind

  whats this-a holdup he de-
manded hotly but obeying the com-
mand

  maybe you two crooks will go
back with me now i guess

  and into the moonlight stepped the
burly figure of osgood the detective

chapter vi

  in a flash allan quentin realized the
damning incrimination of his position
were it not for the girl it would be
laughable enid had risen with a stifled
cry and quentin saw that she must
now be told all

  he himself had nothing to fear be-
yond some humiliation for if osgood
took him back to los angeles he would
speedily be cleared but it was another
thing with enid elsmere mathews
was the only man who could keep her
from burlington thought quentin and
were she to be forced from the island
it might go hard with her

  confound you osgood he cried
angrily as the girl came to his side and
put her hand on his shoulder appeal-
ingly ive done nothing to be arrested
for whats the meaning of all this
anyhow 

  none o your back talk growled
the detective his former suavity com-
pletely vanished step down here
you

  not on your life returned quen-
tin what for

  for housebreaking you fool thats
one thing and ive got more if you
want em youre a slick one you
are not slick enough to fool me
though

  still standing at the top of the steps
quentin forced himself into calmness
and attempted to argue with the man
feeling at the same time that he would
more cheerfully plant his fist on the
heavy chin he explained his business
at the cottage to the extent of saying
that he was leaving a note for mr

mathews and stated that the note be-
neath the door would be proof in his
support if it could be got at to his
renewed dismay the detective only
laughed scornfully

  look here doc you pretty near
put it over on me to-day all right i
had you framed up as a galoot pure
and simple but i guess i had it wrong
you prove your identity and do it in
a hurry unless you want to feel the
bracelets

  quentins chest heaved in helpless
anger he knew that he was undone
for his lost pocketbook held his cards
letters and check fold yet this charge
was so ridiculous that it irritated him
beyond endurance it occurred to him
that there would be a wire from his
housekeeper at the hotel for him and
with new confidence he set forth this
fact

  nothin like that goes here laughed
osgood heavily you mights well
give up that game bo ill take in the
lady dip over there for housebreaking
and you too also i got a charge of
assault against you by the time head-
quarters shakes you down a bit i guess
well get your record yet

 eh say are you crazy ex-
claimed quentin what kind of a
charge are you faking up anyhow
youd better go slow osgood

  come off come off grinned the
detective snapping off his electric torch
as quentin descended a step in his
amazement you made a bad job up
at the club to-day and youll do time
for it the town constable got a re-
port on it and i knew right off who
the guy was-and its you

  great scott gasped quentin
what are you talking about

  oh beat it exclaimed osgood dis-
gustedly didnt you assault a guy
named green up there this afternoon
anyhow hes laid a charge against you
and youre it doc so trot along lively
now and the lady as well
a discord in avalon



  with that it all flashed over quentin
and he emitted a groan of dismay his
two psuedo-friends had put up a fine
joke on him in revenge for his action
of that day he could picture the
drunken glee with which wells and
green had framed up the charge and
then had doubtless gone off on their
trip if he went in to los angeles to
answer it as he must do and if enid
were to be cleared by the only means
possible-that of establishing her iden-
tity burlington would at once assert
his legal rights and she might have to
endure no little mental suffering be-
fore her friends could get her away
from him

  the girl was standing on the top step
still in silent consternation she seemed
to be leaving it all in his hands for
she must have understood what was
passing did she believe all this rig-
marole he groaned again at the
thought that this absurd affair might
have ruined him beyond repair in her
ears-for she could know only what
she heard he broke out in desperate
earnestness

  why man that was only a joke
put up on me by a couple of men who
had been drinking a little too much
you can phone over to the city and
get my description anjl establish the

whole thing-

 look here broke in osgood
roughly i aint going to spend all
night talking to you i got a charge
or two against you and youre going
to answer it thats all you can do
your jawing to headquarters in the
morning

  but you idiot this lady is blind and
is in my care were going to be at
the metropole  to-night and youve
nothing against her that can stand
you go slow on this thing osgood or
you lose your star ill go back with
you to-morrow if you wish when mr
mathews has returned and can take
care of miss elsmere here but dont

you try any bullyragging with me or
youll be sorry im no hobo-

  oh ive got your number and
osgood laughed as he pushed up the
automatic in the moonlight step
down doc good alias you got there
eh 

  quentin saw that there was no help
for it and slowly descended the steps
enid followed him her hand still rest-
ing on his shoulder for a guide her
fingers tightened suddenly anh he knew
that it was a silent expression of con-
fidence in him slight as the thing was
it steadied him and buoyed him up won-
derfully

  at the same time it served to re-
mind him that she was utterly depend-
ent on him the whole miserable
tangle resolved itself in his mind he
knew only that this girls entire future
depended on him and on his extricat-
ing them both from the toils cast about
them by the detective

  as he gazed at the man who was
fishing in his pocket for something that
jangled while at the same time keeping
his automatic carefully in place quen-
tin sensed the wild anger that was surg-
ing up in him it was so unreasonable
-that this brute should hold enid els-
meres future in his thick hands and
never know it the self-assurance the
confident power of the detectives whole
manner flecked quentin on tin raw the
thought of being handcuffed was too
much altogether

  youre not going to handcuff me
my man he asserted flatly osgood
glanced at him noted the ice-cold gray
eyes and the quivering nostrils and
promptly shoved his automatic against
quentins breast

  no games now he warned threat-
eningly menace in his heavy face

  i made you a fair proposition said
quentin forcing himself into calm
ill go along with you but miss els-
mere is under my professional care


new story magazine

and shes going to remain at the metro-
pole-

  cut it out snapped osgood his
left hand fetching out a pair of hand-
cuffs glinting bright in the moonlight
he shoved his jaw forward in ugly
fashion ive had enough jaw out o
you bo youll march down to the
hotel and if shes still keeping up the
blind game she can have you for guide
see now stick out your mitts you
two-your right to his left girly

  he chuckled at his own jest as he
dangled up the handcuffs until that
instant quentin had not realized that
osgood meant to iron the girl he
heard a little frightened gasp break
from her lips and the hand went from
his shoulder for a second he gazed
at the detective incredulous

  osgood read his startled unbelief for
fear and grinned but a flame of rage
had swelled up in quentins brain as
he comprehended the detectives intent
iron this helpless girl a mad fury
settled on him-but it did not destroy
his caution

  he lowered his left hand half turn-
ing as if to bring down the hand of
enid with his right at all costs he
must prevent this outrage and the
greater danger to her that lay behind it
he felt so as osgood lowered his
automatic and reached out with the
open handcuffs quentin swiftly struck
down with his open left hand and
knocked the weapon a dozen feet away

  osgood was taken completely by sur-
prise he ripped out one savage oath
then quemfcis fist drove into his mouth
and sent him staggering back quen-
tin followed him with a leap in des-
perate fear lest he draw another re-
volver but before the detective could
recover himself he had landed a second
blow to the mouth

  he missed the chin but osgood was
goaded into rage and rushed at him
with a shout of fury instead of avoid-
ing the rush quentin stepped into it

took a glancing blow on the cheek and
brought up his right from the waist
with all his force

  there seemed little power in the
blow so swift was it but the detec-
tives arms flew out his head rocked
back and with a single groan he fell
in a crumpled heap over quentins feet
it was a clean knock-out

  quentins mind worked fast in that
instant a glint from the gravel path
caught his eye and he stooped quickly
to grasp the handcuffs he knew that
he must get this fellow out of the way
and silenced at least until a few hours
had passed how he was to manage it
he did not quite see but with the irons
on him osgood would at least be be-
yond making any more mischief for
the present he well knew that this
whole affair would mean future trouble
for himself but he would manage to
get out of it somehow and the main
thing now was to put osgood where
he would be safe for a time

  so without hesitation he brought the
mans wrists together and snapped on
the handcuffs then he straightened
up-and saw enid elsmere standing
just beside him the automatic held in
her hand

  for a moment he stood paralyzed
with astonishment he had knocked
the weapon into the bushes he remem-
bered  if she was blind how had she
secured it was she blind after all

  where-where did you get that
gun  he panted hoarsely how could
you know where it-

  i heard something fall she said
simply i found it-oh what has hap-
pened  why dont you tell me what
youve done i cant see i cant
see

  her wail of despair smote him and
as she dropped the weapon with a little
cry he caught her and held her for
a moment thrilled out of himself by
the clinging softness of her arms

  its all right enid he exclaimed
a discord in avalon



quickly that was a detective who
tried to arrest us he thought we were
thieves and i knew that he must not
take us back to the city i had to
knock him out little girl-keep cool
please do

  at his explanation he felt the swift
contraction of her muscles the sudden
convulsing fear that seized her

  oh it is terrible she cried chok-
ingly i-i had not meant this-i
thought it was all for-i was afraid

you were a-

  and with that she fall in a limp faint
and quentin lowered her to the steps
he straightened up mopping the per-
spiration from his brow and looked
from one to the other of the two silent
figures in blank consternation

  good lord he exclaimed softly
now i am in a mess

  well im dummed say whats
goin on here

  at the voice quentin whirled about
and saw the old caretaker standing a
few yards away too late-the thing
he had feared most of all had hap-
pened  quentin leaned over and picked
up the automatic quietly shoving it into
his coat pocket as he faced the amazed
caretaker

chapter vii

  the caretakers face was a battle-
ground for fear and curiosity and sus-
picion with the odds about even
quentin drew a little breath of relief
as he saw recognition join in the con-
flict and smiled

  any word from mr mathews yet
not yet sir whats all this goings-
on

  curiosity had won the battle for the
caretaker craned forward to stare at
the white form of enid and looked
up again in awe quentin watched the
little old man with wild incoherence in
his brain

   she aint-aint dead sir whos
 this here man

   of a sudden a desperate plan flashed
 on the surgeon thinking over his first
 meeting with the old caretaker he could
 not remember having given the fellow
 his name and as coherence came to
 him he swiftly weighed the chances
 when mathews came all would be well
 -if enids story was true

   get some water to revive this lady
 and get it quick he ordered making a
 plea for time ill explain when you
 get back hurry up man shes
 fainted

  law

   the little old mans face shot from
 wonder into sympathy and he shuffled
 past quentin who stood motionless

   should he take the risk he was
 staking everything on the girls story
 even to his good name when this
 thing came into court as it seemed
 like to do he would have to stand or
 fall by her if she was not blind but
 was the woman pickpocket using him

as a screen-

   he recalled that revolver incident
 not even the sensitive ear of the blind
 could fully account for her swift
 seizure of the weapon in the moonlight
 quentin glanced down at her face and
 its pure beauty its womanly appeal
 sundered all his doubts once more and
 drove him to quick decision

   ill do it he thought grimly the
 lie will make me or break me ive
 got to hold every one off until she gets
 into touch with mathews and if shes
 lied to me then god help her

   there came a glare as the old care-
 taker turned on the house lights and
 quentin plunged forward to his knees
 over osgoods body the whole
 scheme had come to him now it would
 hold things off until the morning at
 least and while it would eventually
 cause a worse muddle than ever it
 promised to save enid elsmere-which
 was the main thing just at present


new story magazine

  swiftly going through the detectives
clothes quentin found a number of
cheap printed cards and letters which
he transferred to his own pockets the
money in the mans pockets he left
untouched but unpinned the star from
his vest and fastened it inside his own
coat

  satisfied at length that osgood had
 means of identification left he
started to rise on second thought he
completely emptied the mans pockets
of money and all else determining to
make a thorough job of it osgood
was breathing heavily and quentin
rose at length to find the old caretaker
shuffling excitedly from the open front
door with a cup of water in his hand

  all right thanks he said and
knelt beside enid hold up the ladys
head and pour some of this on her
face

  while the old man obeyed quentin
swiftly opened the close-fitting neck of
the girls dress to give her air and
loosen her throat a little locket of
gold fell out into his hand as he re-
placed it he noted instinctively that it
bore the letter m inset with bril-
liants his lips clenched grimly it was
not too late yet to-

  for pitys sake dont wash me
away

  her hand caught at his and with
that his resolve clamped down hard

  wake up its raining he cried
forcing a laugh she pulled herself up

 you may think its fun to be

  dont talk now he exclaimed
swiftly here lean back against the
steps and keep quiet

  with the words he pressed her hand
hard whether she caught his meaning
or not she obeyed him and a second
later he rose and found the old care-
taker watching him curiously

  well i suppose youre wondering
about all this eh he smiled easily
heres my card

  with that he handed over one of
the detectives cards at the same time
flinging back his coat to display the
borrowed star the old caretakers jaw
dropped and he looked up from the
card with a blank stare quentin gave
him no chance to speak but touched the
still-unconscious osgood with his foot

  miss elsmere and i came up to see
if mr mathews was home and we
found this fellow trying to break in
in the ensuing discussion the lady
fainted will your master be back in
the morning

  why-why yes sir gasped the old
man gosh a thief on the catalinas
whod a thought of such a thing we
aint had no such thing happen for s

long s i can bring to mind-

  well i want you to take care of
him for me and quentin smiled at
the quick alarm which the old man
manifested hes handcuffed-dont
worry if you have a bit of rope ill
tie his legs and leave him have you
got a shed around here

  yes theres a shed in behind yon-
der but-but-gosh let the con-
stable-

  no this is my affair broke in
quentin quickly also mr mathews
will want to see the man himself

  the caretaker visibly impressed by
this argument went shuffling off after
his rope quentin turned to the girl
and catching her hand raised her to
her feet

  dont say anything now he spoke
swiftly ive taken the only course
possible and ill explain later

  she nodded remembering the note
and fearing that the caretaker would
read it and discover the signature
quentin darte  up the steps found the
paper on the floor of the hall and with
his pencil quickly rendered the signa-
ture illegible he stepped down to find
the caretaker returning and exchanged
the folded paper for the rope the old
man bore
a discord in avalon



  give this note to mr mathews the
moment he returns ill come up in the
morning and take care of this fellow
with that he stooped over osgood
and bound the mans ankles firmly the
caretaker picked up the hapless detec-
tives feet ouentin lifted his shoulders
and with much labor they bore him
around the corner of the cottage to a
small shed as they set him down the
thump fetched a groan out of him and
quentin made all haste to be off when
they stood outside in the moonlight
again he laid his hand impressively
on the old mans arm

  youll have to bring him some food
and water in the morning my friend
but dont believe any yarns he may try
to tell you he may make out hes a
policeman himself or any such thing
but you let me and mr mathews deal
with him

  sure i will retorted the old man
fervently and when they reached the
side entrance again quentin hurriedly
bade him good night and led enid down
the path

  do you feel all right enid

  a little mussy-and very foolish
she laughed shakily im sorry i de-
serted you at the very worst moment
oh tell me something he ex-
claimed pausing as they reached the
inclined railway you started to say
that you were afraid of something that
i was when you went off what did
you mean

  i dont know she replied her head
turned away if you dont mind doc-
tor i wish youd take me right back
i-i feel rather shaken

  cursing himself for a brute yet un-
able to forget her words and the sight
of that locket ouentin said no more
as they returned but that letter m
reminded him of the bracelet he won-
dered grimly if mary palmer had also
given enid the locket by which to re-
member her

  this thought grew on him and when
he recalled what he had just done for
her sake how he had staked his whole
reputation on the truth of her story
doubt rose in him and gripped him
when they entered the hotel he made
up his mind instead of seeking the
elevator he led her to a chair across
the lobby and quietly seated her

  now he began his eyes on her
face i saw that locket about your
neck miss elsmere i do not want
to appear suspicious but i robbed that
detective of his credentials and locked
him up he suspects that you are a
pickpocket who is known to play at
being blind if detected this afternoon
some time my pocket was picked your
name does not tally with the initials
on your jewelry all this means noth-
ing to me believe me i have promised
you my aid and even if you have lied
to me even if you were a thief i would
be only too glad to lend you my assist-
ance all that i ask of you is to tell
me the truth if your story was the
true one i apologize for i really want
to aid you

  he saw the swift struggle that shot
into her face and as her eyes rested
on his it seemed that they must in-
deed be looking at him for that fixed
stare had vanished abruptly but
despite the torture evident in her fea-
tures despite its reflection on his own
heart he said what he had meant to
say and waited

  her hands twisted in her lap and
against all reason quentin felt a mad
impulse to cover them with his own
then she calmed herself with a quiet
effort her face pale

  i can only say that when we see mr
mathews you will be forced to believe
me doctor ouentin she said quietly
i am sorry for all this dreadful affair
that has come upon you i do not want
you drawn into my troubles-

  say no more please he cried with
a little laugh rising i was a brute


new story magazine

and i am sorry myself now come to
the elevator and ill say good night

  no more words passed between them
but at the door of her room their hands
met in silent parting then quentin
returned to the office obtained a large
envelope and sealed up the money and
papers he had taken from the detective
writing the others name across the flap

  kindly take care of this he said to
the night clerk mr osgood will call
for it to-morrow unless i do myself

  this settled he visited the telegraph
desk and found a message awaiting
him ten minutes later he sought his
own room supplied with money a most
undesirable alias and a police star
whose magnitude appalled him

  this bit of nickel is going to get
me into a bad fuss he thought- gazing
at the thing well i may be able to
bribe osgood to shut up if the thing
gets straightened out in time if it
doesnt i know a rising young surgeon
who is going to be in dutch but i
only wish enid hadnt slipped me that
mary palmer yarn that gets my
goat

  think it over as he would he could
arrive at no conclusion finally he
phoned a call for eight in the morning
and went to bed wondering if the aw-
ful muddle would leave him any chance
to sleep but contrary to his own ex-
pectations the memory of bert osgood
trussed up in his shed merged into the
lap of the waves under the hotel win-
dows and allan quentin ended his first
day in avalon in greater peace than he
had passed it

chapter viii

  at eight-twenty quentin was drink-
ing in the fresh air of the new morning
from the wharf as enid had promised
to breakfast with him at nine the
situation seemed not nearly so bad as
it had appeared the night before
mathews would be over in the morning

boat to relieve him of his charge and it
seemed less probable that burlington
would be able to track enid by the one
or two men who had helped her at long
beach

  however her manner worried him
there was a good deal that lacked ex-
planation and quentin began to fear
that her blindness was in reality due to
a brain tumor after all she had only
put him off when he had set the matter
frankly before her last night the
thing that forced him to believe in her
was her appeal to mathews for by
quiet inquiries quentin had found that
the man was a retired lawyer of some
prominence and of high repute yet it
was a bitter job to quell his forebod-
ings and compel himself to belief his
greatest aid in this was the remem-
brance of the girls face it haunted
him and filled him with strange long-
ings-what a pity she had this afflic-
tion he thought

  he roused himself at sight of a trim
launch cutting in around the headland
and caught the words long beach
boat from a group of boatman loung-
ing near by as he made out the two
figures sitting in the launch quentin
started it seemed as though a cold
hand had gripped suddenly at his heart
well he knew that erect precise figure
which had as usual retained its frock
coat and silk hat even on a launch
trip

  as the boat drew in to the wharf
quentins sudden fear passed into ex-
hilaration he noted the rather flaccid
face the quick-darting blue eyes the
massive jaw under the crisp gray mus-
tache and laughed since doctor hall
burlington had come enid must have
told him the true story after all he
forgot all else in that swift thought-
even to the bound detective who lay in
the shed behind the mathews cottage
and realizing that he must get burling-
ton off the track he stepped foavard
to meet the launch as it drifted in
a discord in avalon



  hello burlington he called easily
got a hurry call

  burlingtons quick blue eye picked
him out and the other waved a hand
in reply the launch drew up burling-
ton seized quentins hand and mounted
to the wharf then tossed a gold piece
to the boatman in payment

  morning quentin-youre just the
man i want to see and he took the
younger mans arm come along-
are you on vacation

  partly responded quentin falling
into step he noted that burlingtons
manner was not wholly free of agita-
tion whats up-an operation
no and the other glanced around
then halted are you free to help me
a bit quentin professional confi-
dence understand

  quentin met his eve and laughed
lightly

  i guess so burlington ive a pa-
tient at the hotel but my times my
own you must be in a devil of a hurry
to come over in a little launch like that
man

  i am and the other grimaced then
fell to mopping his brow gazing at
him quentin felt sudden dislike of the
man to him burlington had always
seemed rather formal and precise but
now it was as though a mask had been
stripped away quentin  longer
doubted every word of enids story
and his mind raced desperately he
knew that at all costs he must keep
burlington from seeing that hotel reg-
ister and he suddenly resolved on a
bold course

  did you come over yesterday
the blue eyes shot into his suddenly

  yes-i brought over a girl from
los angeles why

  you didnt happen -to notice any-
thing of a blind young woman on the
boat did you 

  sure and quentin laughed again
holding the blue eyes to his my pa-

tient is a young woman and blind
whats the matter burlington

  her name the other gripped his
arm his face flaming a dull red
whats her name quentin

  why-miss palmer lied quentin
as the name flashed into his mind the
older mans hand fell away and he
mopped at his face again with a sigh of
relief

  i beg your pardon quentin-im a
little overwrought i fancy at the
pause quentin chuckled inwardly his
bold ruse had worked and it was evi-
dent that the other man held no sus-
picions burlington hesitated then
laughed harshly taking quentins arm
again

  im in rather a hard position quen-
tin i had charge of a girl-a blind
young woman whos unfortunately af-
flicted with flightiness he was getting
back his usual precise air by this time
yes encouraged quentin

  as i say she is addicted to melan-
cholia and odd conceptions-imagines
that shes an abused heiress and all
that nothing dangerous but a very
interesting case no doubt due to a brain
tumor im hoping that an operation
will fix her up first rate but yester-
day morning she got away-we had her
under observation you understand
from various persons i found that she
had got to a san pedro car and had
been inquiring about the islands and
there seems to be no doubt that she
came over here yesterday

  well thats easily fixed suggested
quentin craftily a word to the con-
stable here and hell be able-

  no no burlington cried sudden-
ly halting him again with evident haste
she is very sensitive and anything in
the nature of a scene might throw her
into hysteria quentin its a matter for
me to handle personally and if youll
give me your help ill be very glad in-
deed

  certainly ill do whatever i can

and quentins cold gray eyes and reso-
lute face gave no hint of the double
meaning in his words hows mrs
burlington and dolly have you had
any breakfast

  no-theyre all right came the
confused answer quentin had a hazy
idea of getting burlington off to one
of the smaller hotels for breakfast
youd better take a day off and run
out before long old man you look
rather run down by the way i think
we had better go up to the metropole
and start inquiries there and ill get a
bite to eat

  quentins heart leaped this was the
very thing he had feared if he could
only keep burlington away from the
metropole register he might be able to
waste time until the morning boat came
in and if mathews did not come then
he would simply have to make an open
break with burlington and take enid
under his own protection-though he
had a very hazy idea of the law in such
cases however the main thing was to
keep the two apart for a time

  what was the girls name he tem-
porized wondering how to manage
things

  elsmere-enid elsmere came the
answer and his last doubts of the girl
fled away still she might not use her
own name quentin the easiest way
to track her will be by her blindness
well look here dnd quentin
halted in desperation ill run up to
the metropole and arrange to get away
and also make inquiries you cover the
stamford and hermosa and ill meet
you at the latter place for breakfast
hows that

  burlington drew a hand across his
heavy lips and nodded

  all right quentin hadnt you bet-
ter have a description of the young
woman 

  it might help smiled quentin
thinking that he needed little description
of the person in question he glanced

at his watch and found that he still
had fifteen minutes to spare therell
be  trouble in locating her though
hope not grunted burlington the
blue eyes darting around them until
quentin felt some uneasiness lest enid
come forth for a morning stroll how-
ever i know exactly the clothes she
wore when she got away shes a rather
small young woman about twenty-two
in appearance though in reality shes
not so old black-haired and gray-eyed
wearing a deep red dress of some soft
stuff with a dark-gray wrap

  eh quentin suddenly felt as
though his entire structure had been
riven asunder just go over that
again if you dont mind

  the other repeated his description
but quentin was only sparring for
time trying to keep his amazement
concealed those few words had stag-
gered him swept him out of his depth

  good heavens he thought grop-
ing after some fragment of sanity in
the wild mix-up enid is violet-eyed
brown-haired and has a white dress-
and shes pretty near as tall as i am
am i crazy or is burlington 

  there was nothing but the most pre-
cise earnestness in the other mans man-
ner however he would have no reason
to give a false description of the girl
reflected quentin but this thought led
him into a new maze of probabilities
it was unlikely in the extreme that
there would be more than one blind girl
out of the lot for that would be stretch-
ing coincidence too far yet the de-
tective had been after a blind girl his
own charge was blind-or said she was
blind and here burlington was after
another one

  so far the only one of the three who
had materialized was his own girl she
-had claimed to be enid elsmere but
was she she did not answer burling-
tons description and quentin felt a
swift and horrible doubt of her was
she the woman pickpocket after all
a discord in avalon



had she deliberately builded on the
name of enid elsmere with some
knowledge of the state of things in
burlingtons household on which to
base her structure of lies

  the only other possibility was that
burlington had given him a false de-
scription and this seemed utterly im-
probable out of the question there
was no reason for it and quentin
looked up with helpless struggle in his
eyes

  go ahead to the other two places
burlington ill meet you and well
either breakfast at the hermosa-or
come back to the metropole

  the other strode off with a curt nod
quentins last words had been born of
a desperate idea a frantic effort to cut
this whole weird gordian knot at one
blow if burlington had given him the
true description of his ward then the
girl at the metropole was posing under
an assumed name

  in that case a meeting between them
would only serve to show her that
quentin had pierced through her de-
ception and it would undoubtedly pro-
voke a straightforward explanation be-
tween them

  on the other hand if burlington had
lied in his description and she was the
real enid elsmere the thing would
come to a show-down then and there
burlington would be taken in his own
net and if he attempted to claim the
girl quentin decided that he himself
could then step in with some semblance
of right

  just the same he thought as he
leaped up the hotel steps ill stick by
her if shes a pickpocket ill be a
whole lot mistaken but whatever she
is or does ill give her one more chance
to come across with the truth by
george i cant believe that she has
been deliberately acting a part all this
time

  prompted by a sudden thought that

he might find two enid elsmeres regis-
tered he strode over to the desk only
to have the hope destroyed also the
day clerk made a reference to the en-
velope waiting for osgood which
showed that he was inclined to be sus-
picious and quentin hastily assured
him that the detective would call for
it that day he turned to the elevator
wondering miserably how he was going
to get out of the net that he had tan-
gled around himself

  at enids door he found her waiting
for him and her quiet poise her air of
utter confiding trust in him almost
shook him from the resolution he had
taken yet-at sight of him did a
shadow of alarm flit over her face as
though she read the conflict in his eyes
or did she merely sense it subconscious-
ly

  he laid this to his imagination how-
ever when he took her hand and an-
swered her greeting trying to keep his
voice level as he led her from the
elevator across the lobby toward the
dining room he spoke lightly

  if you dont mind ill get you seat-
ed then ill run over to the hermosa
and bring back a chap i want you to
meet miss elsmere

  try as he would he could not keep
his voice quite firm and the glance she
flashed him only heightened his self-ac-
cusation then she nodded and smiled

  certainly-ill be glad to meet any
of your friends

  we wont call him a friend
laughed quentin uneasily beginning to
reproach himself already anyway
you sit down here and ill be right back
oh yes-i think that ill introduce you
as miss palmer too your absent girl
friend wont object to that i trust

  as you please doctor she replied
seating herself

  quentin hurried away a little chilled
by those final words he found bur-
lington waiting for him on the steps of
the hermosa precise and dignified as

ever but with uneasiness resting in his
never-quiet blue eyes

  what luck burlington

  none so far you did not find her
at the metropole

  no but my patient is waiting to
breakfast with us come on over and
after breakfast if nothing has hap-
pened well soon locate your patient
burlington nodded his eyes resting
on quentin for a second then with a
rather patronizing manner which was
peculiarly offensive to the younger man
he took quentins arm and they walked
back to the other hotel

  the next five minutes would take
him out of the labyrinth thought quen-
tin-in one way or the other

chapter ix

  by the way asked quentin halt-
ing on the steps of the hotel and de-
termining swiftly to see just where
burlington stood from whom did your
patient escape she was not confined
i suppose

  the other shot him a quick glance
but quentins face expressed only in-
terested curiosity and sympathy

  no she was-er-being taken care
of by friends who lived at long beach
it was not thought that she would try
to get away for her mind has never
run to violence or anything of the sort
she merely slipped out alone got a man
in the street to help her on the car and
that was an end f it her friends
wanted to call in detectives and all that
sort of thing but i happened to find the
man who had helped her and that made
all straight shes over here somewhere
and should be easy to locate

  that clinched the matter in quentins
mind he tried to recall any girl an-
swering the description of enid on the
boat coming over but could not in
fact he had been too much absorbed
with his own blind girl to watch other
people

  well my friend and professional
brother youve lied neatly he thought
grimly as they entered the hotel the
thought halted him mentally however
had burlington lied to him after all

  he had doubted enids story in the
first place though she had substanti-
ated it by her seeming knowledge of
burlingtons family if her story had
been true burlington had just nowlied
to him yet burlington had described
an entirely different girl as the one for
whom he was searching which would
rather tend to back up his own story

  i cant make head nor tail of it
groaned quentin to himself ill sim-
ply introduce em and that will put the
whole thing on the knees of the gods
and i feel blatned sorry for the gods

  pleading that there was no time to
waste on formalities he steered bur-
lington past the desk without register-
ing they left their hats at the dining-
room entrance and he led the way to-
ward the table at which enid elsmere
still sat he reflected that if she had
lied to him it would be poetic justice
that he should introduce her by the
name of mary palmer

  before they reached the table quen-
tin had found the answer to his men-
tal questionings he saw burlingtons
eyes fall on the figure of enid then
flicker on without any change to the
next table the girl had not been rec-
ognized

  this settled one doubt only to raise
another how could she have known of
the blind girl in burlingtons care the
physicians presence proved that there
had been such a person and quentin
had no more doubts that the girls story
had been a true one whether true as
regarded herself or not however a
moment later they hadv reached the
table and there was no time to reflect
on the situation

  miss palmer allow me to present
doctor hall burlington-burlington
my patient miss palmer
a discord in avalon



  burlington bowed in his precise man-
ner but the girls face suddenly flamed
scarlet then became dead white quen-
tin could almost have sworn that there
was sight in the violet eyes that went
from one to the other of them

  you are now breakfasting with
two famous professional men miss
palmer he went on forcing a laugh
now that he had found out what he
wanted to know he refused to torture
the girl further if she was a pick-
pocket-well and good it was still to
be explained how she had known of
bis own intimacy with dolly burling-
ton

  but it is the gentlemen who are hon-
ored added burlington with heavy
gallantry you are a native daughter
miss palmer

  no she faltered but with an evi-
dent effort regained her self-control
no i am an eastern girl doctor
burlington i am merely spending a
few months with friends-in los an-
geles

  with this the waiter bustled up and
the girl had a chance to recover which
she did slowly her manner gave quen-
tin no doubt of her evident shame and
distress but at thought of his own
simple-minded faith in her story quen-
tin felt little remorse at his action

  none the less he steered burlington
into a line of talk which he could keep
up indefinitely the long beach phy-
sician had bought heavily in real estate
during the past year or two and conse-
quently was a booster of the most
virulent type he talked at length until
breakfast was served quentin and the
girl having only to throw in a word
here and there to keeping him going

  another crisis was coming from a
source which quentin little suspected
however before breakfast was half
over a waiter brought him in a note
which he tore open with a word of
apology to the others it was a very
brief and curt request that he visit the

office wondering what was up now
he excused himself and went out to
the desk finding there the clerk with
whom osgood had been talking on the
previous day the clerk nodded at him
and led him into the interior office

  doctor he said challengingly you
left a package here for that bull os-
good last night osgood had reserved
a room here and hes not shown up
ill have to have an explanation-i may
as well tell you frankly that he sus-
pected that lady with you of-

  go easy warned quentin and at
the icy flame in his eyes the clerk drew
back where osgood is isnt my busi-
ness or yours either as for that lady
shes a patient in my charge and if you
know doctor burlington of long
beach youll find him at breakfast with
us now and he can identify me youve
made a mistake young man and youd
better back water pretty hard and do
it quick

  the clerk tried to stare him down
but the result was only to send him into
a stammering apology and quentin
knew that his bluff had gone down
none the less he insisted on sending
for burlington and when that individ-
ual arrived and identified him in some
surprise ouentin promptly closed the
incident

  merely a matter of cashing a
check he explained to burlington as
they returned to their table the other
waved his hand loftily sat down with
a pompous air which ruffled quentin
afresh adjusted his cuffs and fell to
his breakfast quentin smiled at the
girl and was astonished to see a little
color rise in her cheeks-as if she had
seen the smile and took it for an as-
surance from that moment he was
convinced that she was no other than
the pickpocket and that she was no
more blind than he was

  the delicate irony of forcing burling-
ton to help him out made him chuckle
again but he longed for mathews to


new story magazine

show up that the tangle might be com-
plete certainly this girl had been con-
fident in her appeal to mathews and
quentin wondered if every one who
came into contact with her was to be
drawn into some wild imbroglio os-
good had certainly suffered therefor
and just at present burlington seemed
to be in for future trouble also

  now miss palmer he said finally
doctor burlington and i are going out
to look up a professional case into
which he has drawn me on consulta-
tion you wont mind if  leave you
for an hour or so

  of course not she smiled up at
him with a rather pathetic effort at
brightness he thought but youll
take me to my room first

  by all means

  burlington shook hands with her in
his most precise air and quentin led
her from the dining room keeping up
the farce she said nothing until they
had stepped from the elevator then
quentin turned her around gently
well enid elsmere

  she put out her hand to his arm im-
pulsively	

  doctor quentin you made a prom-
ise to enid elsmere to help her to es-
cape from her guardian you gave me
to understand that your promise was
ironclad do you wish to be released
from it or not

  ouentin was taken aback by her firm
voice and as he searched her face he
found it impossible to believe that this
girl was a shamed discomfited thief
she was making no plea she was mere-
ly asking him a direct question

  my dear girl he said softly ltis
hand closing on hers please let this
matter drop until i can get back for a
talk i know very well that you have
not told me the truth but that does not
affect my willingness to stand by you
even if you are a thief as the detective
believed yesterday my promise stands
when i met burlington and he told me

about the girl he was seeking i saw
from his description that it was not
you he was after now do you want to
see mr mathews or shall i stave him
off also

  no she returned with a half-sob-
bing laugh oh if he were only here
now i would be able to tell you every-
thing come to me when you get
through with doctor burlington-i will
explain to you then if i can please-
please continue to trust me

  look up at me mary palmer he
said and her head came up but if the
vacant fixed stare in the violet eyes
was assumed he could not tell now
under the circumstances-if youll par-
don my language-wouldnt any man
who granted that request be nothing
short of a damned fool

  she flushed then to his amaze-
ment a laugh flickered across her face
yes-but i still make it

  all right-its granted he smiled
cheerfully unable to resist the charm of
her ill be back as soon as i can
shake burlington and get straightened
out i dont know whether youre blind
or not or whether there are three blind
girls wandering around avalon or
whether your name is enid elsmere or
mary palmer-but ill bank on you
and you can depend on me to the limit
her face changed-confidence and
regret and perplexity following each
other in swift succession quentin saw
that the violet eyes had lost their fixed
expression but that might have been
because of the tears that glittered in
them

  oh i-i wish i could have known
that yesterday she faltered then
pushing him back as she averted her
head to hide her tears she left him
quickly and entered her own room

  quentin flung back his shoulders ag-
gressively as he returned to the eleva-
tor so then the whole matter was
at last out in the open she was the
pickpocket and no other-yet for the
a discord in avalon



sake of her indefinable appeal for the
sake of her smile and the touch of her
hand he was going to help her elude
justice at the cost of his own good
name and reputation it might well be

  then ill be a damned fool to the
limit he reflected bitterly but i
wont believe her a thief until she has
told me so herself

  fate had not yet finished with him
however-or rather he was still serv-
ing as a shuttlecock between fate and
nemesis as he left the elevator he
saw the desk clerk burlington and
another-a pudgy man in policemans
clothes-talking quietly together and
evidently waiting for him the clerk
turned to him with puzzled deference

  here he is now doctor quentin
this is the island constable mr mc-
bean itn sorry sir but you seem in
hot water all around to-day

  whats the matter now smiled
quentin wondering if his fight with
osgood had become noised abroad the
pudgy constable eyed him in hesitation

  why sir i didnt know exactly
what to do-you see a couple of gen-
tlemen at the club yesterday-

  oh that quentin laughed again
in relief he remembered that osgood
had said something about the constable
in connection with the reported assault
youre looking that up

  the pudgy constable whose lack of
duties made his office a sinecure nodded
doubtfully

  yes sir doctor burlington says

that youre all right though-

  of course i am laughed quentin
and at that he explained exactly how
the affair at the club had come about
and stated that it was no doubt a joke
perpetrated by green

  i guess thats right sir said mc-
bean grinning ive been talking to
the people up there and mr green
was a little off color im afraid hes
gone off fishing so if doctor burling-
ton will vouch for you wed better let

the thing hang over it wont do to
give the island a bad name you know

  of course of course broke in
burlington in evident haste to be off
after his quarry ill answer for
quentin my man-any one in los an-
geles knows him now come along
quentin we cant waste any more
time

  so for the second time burlington
had extricated him from a difficulty
quentin grinned inwardly as he fol-
lowed the other to the steps he saw a
good inahy more difficulties ahead no-
tably that of osgood but these could
all wait and now he put himself at the
disposal of burlington with a very
cheerful heart

  they discussed the affair in hand
and after a brief talk decided that
they could do nothing except make a
canvass of the half dozen smaller
hotels in order to save as much time
as possible they divided these between
them and burlington strode away with
the tourists sending amused glances at
his formal attire and shiny topper

  as quentin had no intention of wast-
ing his time on a search to which he
felt that enid elsmere-or mary
palmer-held the clew he promptly sat
down on a bench and prepared to re-
port failure on burlingtons return he
preferred to postpone his talk with the
girl until he had burlington off his
hands

  well im in good and deep he re-
flected ruefully biting the end from a
cigar and settling down now lets
get cleared up my enid is probably
named mary palmer and appears to be
a woman thief whom osgood is after
osgood is locked up in mathews shed
and therefore may be eliminated as a
factor but what about mathews if
the worst comes to the worst i can hire
a launch and skip out with enid-or
whatever her name is-and get home
and wait for arrest

  if i was a hero of romance id


new story magazine

probably lure burlington up to that
shed and pile him in with osgood by
george though if he hadnt backed
up enids yarn by his own errand here
id find it hard to believe of him i
cant pretend to like him a whole lot
but it doesnt seem exactly probable
that such high-flown villain stunts
could be put over outside of a dime
novel anyhow im getting to be a
beautifully finished liar myself

  this last admitted of no dispute and
the outlook seemed dismal in conse-
quence he saw now that he had made
a mistake in taking osgoods identity
on himself with the old caretaker on
the previous evening that in itself
might lead to undesired complications
unless mathews arrived in time and
what would happen then  since the
girls story had been untrue where did
mathews come in except as another
disturbing factor

  if i dont go mad first he laughed
hopelessly flinging away his cigar i
am due to catch it from all concerned
well theres burlingtons silk tile com-
ing down the hill so now for another
bunch of lies i suppose

  it flashed over him as he stood wait-
ing that mary palmer no doubt had
his pocketbook for him that must
have been what she meant by her final
exclamation if i had only known
that yesterday her explanation then
would take a very material form and
the sooner made the better for when
he had plenty of ready cash in hand he
could visit osgood and undoubtedly
bribe him off his private revenge even
though osgood had arrested him false-
ly there might be trouble in prospect

  well any luck quentin

  he turned to find burlington once
more mopping his heavy face with his
pompous air somewhat dissipated

  nothing doing returned quentin
briefly eying his confrere seems to
me youre a whole lot excited over the
matter burlington by the way i just

recalled the fact that id heard that
girls name before-seems as though
dolly had mentioned an enid elsmere
to me

  burlingtons cheeks flushed slightly
then mottled he forced a harsh laugh

  youre twisted quentin its rankly
impossible now im sure i dont know
just what to do-a house-to-house can-
vass is absurd of course

  had miss elsmere any friends
here asked quentin craftily

  no no of course not exploded the
other testily since shes not at the
larger hotels we might as well start
systematic inquiries along the water
front she cant have got very far
without being seen

  quentin nodded thinking rapidly
he might as well accompany burling-
ton and keep him occupied in the quest
since there really was an enid elsmere
and since the physician was plainly in
no little mental distress over the disap-
pearance also he determined to
probe burlingtons mind and make sure
of his ground on the heiress question
before he committed himself to any
definite break with the other but first
he must telephone the girl and let her
know why he could not return imme-
diately

  ill step into the drug store here
and call up miss palmer he said id
better let her know that this thing is
apt to take all morning

  burlington nodded and dropped on
the bench while quentin strode to the
corner store and got the metropole on
the telephone when he inquired for
miss elsmere he found that she had
gone out and in response to his
amazed questions the operator switched
his friend the desk clerk on the wire

  yes doctor explained that indi-
vidual with a touch of malice in his
voice a message came for her just
after you went v out with doctor bur-
lington she also went out

  what-alone 
a discord in avalon



  yes sir-and blindness didnt seem
to bother her much either

  good lord gasped quentin in-
wardly then aloud didnt she
leave any word

  yes she said shed be back in an
hour or less sir oh-by the way did
you lose a pocketbook yesterday doc-
tor

  you bet uttered quentin weakly
wondering if she had left it for him
why 

  it was just turned in a minute ago
-one of the boatmen found it yester-
day in his launch looked your name
up at the hotels and left it for you
all right said quentin get his
name and ill reward him good-by
he staggered out into the sunlight
too dazed to do more than rejoin bur-
lington and allow himself to be patro-
nized without protest after extracting
that promise of trust from him-the
girl had skipped out it was the last
straw

chapter x

  a blind girl why no doctor
burlington you havent lost one
oh no-no not at all-she is with
friends and i was merely looking them
up and with this burlington backed
quentin away from the information
bureau at the pier and made all haste
to flee

  quentin chuckled

  he was more interested in asking
questions than answering them bur-
lington  i guess the best thing to do
would be to chuck the whole thing into
the hands of the police theyll find
your blind girl soon enough

  heavens no my reputation my
standing- and burlington rum-
bled on with more confusion than co-
herence until at length he pulled him-
self together the quick and vivid in-
terest manifested by the officials in his
questions had entirely disconcerted him


and quentin had not assisted greatly
in restoring his composure

  since that telephone conversation
with the desk clerk indeed quentin
had grown beyond fearing anything
while they wandered along he had
kept a sharp lookout for mary palmer
but without success also he had man-
aged to probe through a good deal of
his companions pompous and precise
air to find a growing dismay under-
neath it

  i cant see your objection to the
police and quentin baited him coldly
the girl is nothing to you except a
patient it doesnt reflect on you that
she got away since she was not con-
fined in your house of course if she
was insane or something of that sort
and you had kept her hidden away it
would be different

  burlington hunched his heavy shoul-
ders in something like a shiver though
it was a very warm day and his face
remained mottled his blue eyes were
darting about in desperate fashion and
quentin was beginning to pierce to the
real man underneath the mask so con-
stantly presented to the world

  nor did he find it good burlingtons
usual restraint and calm precision were
shattered and as the time dragged past
with no result from their quest the
older mans anxiety and terrific earnest-
ness were increased tenfold dominating
all else and quentins merciless jabs
the more merciless because of their ap-
parent innocence drew blood

  well it looks as if mary palmer
had ducked to let me take whats com-
ing reflected quentin i guess ill
drag down another honorable physician
and surgeon just the same burling-
tons a heap more of a crook than mary
palmer ill bet a dollar

  as they passed the metropole while
making the rounds quentin stepped in-
side and secured his lost pocketbook
which he found all intact his sus-
picion that the girl had left it for him


new story magazine

had been shattered there was no doubt
that he had lost it aboard the launch
the previous afternoon and with no
little relief he peeled off a ten-spot for
the boatman found that the girl had
not returned and rejoined burlington
outside

  it irritated quentin that he should be
spending his time on this aimless search
when he had more important things to
concern his energies so mary palmer
had had a message from whom
was it possible that mathews had-but
he could not see just where she had
any connection with mathews despite
her anxiety on the subject so he gave
over thinking of it and endeavored to
drive the whole affair from his mind

  here sit down and rest a bit he
exclaimed when another half hour had
gone by without result save that bur-
lingtons poke collar was going down
fast quentins quiet coolness irritated
the older man

  confound it he returned though
he obeyed the order youre a cold-
blooded beast quentin

  i dont see the necessity of getting
worked up over this said quentin
calmly seating himself beside the other
by the way burlington what became
of that ward of yours didnt i hear
something about your being given the
guardianship of some one two or three
years ago

  burlington started slightly and his
blue eyes settled on quentin uneasily

  eh why-did dolly tell you that
he exclaimed savagely

  i dont remember where i heard it
answered quentin lightly ill have to
ask dolly about it some time

  you neednt bother grunted bur-
lington yes the story was true but
i got rid of the responsibility immedi-
ately afterward i had almost forgot-
ten it myself here have a cigar
quentin accepted the weed enjoying
to the full the other mans nervous and
abrupt demeanor that hall burling-

ton was a scoundrel he no longer
doubted

  its a cinch that all the crooks arent
in the rogues gallery he told himself
as he watched the mottled and uneasy
features of the erstwhile pompous phy-
sician i guess id sooner be in my
shoes than his right now

  upon this he remembered that he had
something coming to him when math-
ews arrived to release the imprisoned
detective and asked burlington about
the boat to his dismay he found that
the first one over from san pedro was
that on which he had come-the noon
boat which meant that he had two
hours to wait as burlington noticed
his surprise he stated that he expected
to meet a mr j m mathews and in-
quired if the other knew him

  by mere name only returned bur-
lington nervously a lawyer of some
reputation i believe i trust youre in
no legal difficulty quentin

  oh no-merely a personal matter
laughed quentin and chuckled inward-
ly as burlington rose with an oath

  i cant sit down any longer quen-
tin come on-im going to find that
young woman-ive got to find her
this confounded anxiety is going to
make a nervous wreck of me if it isnt
settled

  he seemed to be that already thought
quentin as he rose since they had
already covered the larger hotels-or
at least burlington thought they had-
and the chief places of interest along
the curve of the harbor they struck
down toward the canvas city more
than once a splash of dark red among
the crowds lured them in vain pursuit
and the farther they went the more
burlington lost of his precise air and
dignified pose he had plainly counted
it a small task to locate enid elsmere
in avalon and quentin managed to
forget his own troubles in watching
burlingtons poise grow beautifully
less
a discord in avalon



  he had never liked the older man
particularly for burlingtons cold man-
ner was not calculated to attract men
to him now that this was stripped
from him quentin liked him even less
underneath the mask lay a sheer brutal
violence which was somewhat of a sur-
prise to him while it bore out the story
told him by mary palmer-though he
could not see how she had become
aware of it that was a problem which
quentin resolutely shut out of his mind
however in some way the girl had
learned how things stood and since
she had skipped out in order to avoid
an explanation he was determined to
probe burlington to the depths

  finally they ran across constable
mcbean and in helpless despair bur-
lington called in his services to find miss
elsmere since mcbeans principal duty
was to keep anything in the nature of
a disturbance under cover he nodded
solemnly in pledge of secrecy and bus-
tled off without delay

  good god  breathed burlington
hoarsely mopping at his face as lie
watched the retreating blue form t
cant- stand this suspense quentin  we
should have found that girl without
any trouble-i wonder what could have
happened to her

  perhaps she found friends sug-
gested quentin cruelly and the other
groaned

  no she-she was practically un-
known burlington glanced around
wildly and quentin made haste to get
him out of the sun the older man
looked startlingly close to apoplexy he
thought

  if-if she gets hold of people
quentin-shell play on their sym-
pathies and make all kinds of trouble
for me confound it ill have her ex-
amined for insanity if we get hold of
her-

  eh i thought you said she was
nothing to you broke in quentin
mercilessly

  shes not burlington wrenched at
his collar and his heavy jaw shoved
out as he glared suspiciously at the
younger man what are you trying
to insinuate quentin youd better

watch your words-

  come come keep your self-control
burlington said quentin sternly im
not insinuating anything-youre the
one to watch your words i guess

  i beg your pardon muttered the
other trying to collect himself im
a bit worked up old man youll have
to overlook what i say come on lets
get up to the metropole and sit down
a bit in the cool im afraid im getting
old quentin

 the younger man laughed and
started along beside him to the hotel
a moment later however he suddenly
caught sight of a hatless figure a short
half block away and stood paralyzed
there was no mistaking the heavy un-
dershot jaw and the burly form-and
worse yet the other had seen him he
must have left the key of those hand-
cuffs somewhere in osgoods pockets
quentin thought nemesis had come
upon him

chapter xi

  i guess youll have to identify me
again burlington said quentin coolly
watching the detective bearing down
upon them here comes a chap who
took me for a housebreaker last night
when i was up at mathews cottage
i had a scrap with him and left him
tied up

  you seem to be making the most
of your holiday grunted burlington
stopping

  quentin laughed a little fairly
breathing forth rage and vengeance
osgood came striding down on them
his face was purple with suppressed
fury his clothes were torn and awry
and he looked anything but prepossess-
ing quentin quietly reached for his


new story magazine

pocketbook extracting a twenty-dollar
bill and stood holding it unostentatious-
ly as the detective raged up with fists
waving

 you-you-you- gasped os-
good choked by his own vehement
anger

  hello old man chuckled quentin
pleasantly been detained

  the detective managed to emit an
oath but he was unarmed and plainly
had not any great desire to taste quen-
tins fist again without the requisite
backing

  you come along with me you dirty t
crook he stormed careless of the
passing tourists who paused to watch
him curiously ive got the goods on
you now all right and ill land you

for ten years-

  here whats all this row de-
manded burlington with some asperity
he had managed to regain some of his
customary air which in conjunction
with his silk hat and frock coat im-
pressed the detective to the point of
giving definite and coherent answer
you cant go on like this in the street
my man what does this mean any-
way 

  it means that im a headquarters
man returned osgood truculently
transferring his attentions to burling-
ton who instantly ruffled up quentin
reached up took the star from his vest
and silently folded the twenty-dollar
bill under it dont you come any of
your gay stuff on me or ill pull you
along with this pal of yours whats
your name

  my name is burlington my man-
hall burlington m d of long
bcach stiffly answered the other his
ire restoring all his pompous air a
little more of your impertinence sir
and ill have the officials deport you
from the island

  there was nothing weak about hall
burlington for all his rage the keen-
eyed detective gave back before the

others bristling dignity accustomed to
judge men osgood was sobered down
on the instant being placed on the de-
fensive

  no offense he blurted out only
youre trailin around with this fellow
and hes playing the doctor game like-
wise

  i take it youre a detective  queried
burlington quentin saw that his bully-
ing instincts were fully aroused and
chuckled to himself

  i am that retorted osgood blunt-
ly and if youre what you say show
me i aint aiming to be offensive doc
but im goin to run in this guy and do
it prompt

  i fancy not exploded burlington
this gentleman is doctor allan quen-
tin and is very well known to me if
you have any doubt as to my character
sir you may make inquiries of any of
the officials here now explain the
meaning of this outrage or i shall take
this matter up with your superiors i
dont fancy being made the butt of a
crowd of people by a bull-headed plain-
clothes man

  as he spoke burlington glared
around at the curious tourists who had
assembled some of these moved on
hastily others gave him brazen ap-
plause which was as a red rag to a
bull osgood flung a black look at
quentin

  doc youre the goods i guess since
this guy is your friend ill put it up
to you and you can come over and go
bail for him if you want to

  with that osgood gave a succinct
description of what had happened on
the previous evening from his point of
view briefly prefacing it with his tale
of the pickpocket and concluding with
the story of how he had gotten away
from the shed

  my name was on my gun belt and
when i made that old fool of a care-
taker understand what was what half
an hour ago he unlocked me and here
a discord in avalon



i am now doc i aint got my gun
but if your friend here wants to start
anything i guess hell get all hes after
this thing is kind o balled up but i
know what assault is all right
quentin stepped forward holding out
the star and smiling a little

  heres your badge osgood you
might need it

  the detective gave him another black
look and reached out as his hand closed
around the star and he felt the folded
bill he glanced down quickly the
black look vanished and quentin drew
out his pocketbook telling of how it
had been located

  now osgood here are cards and
papers to establish my identity he
laughed easily as for our little scrap
you forced that yourself but im quite
willing to make it right with you i
told you the exact truth last night when
i said that i had put a note under the

door for mr mathews-

  i know that interrupted the other
shoving the bill into his pocket with a
furtive grin i seen it this morning
after id got free now if the other
doc here will step over to the pier we
can fix this thing up with the officials
i guess

  quentin grinned to himself great
was the power of money  that twenty-
dollar bill had changed the detectives
whole outlook on life in a flash from
a blustering vengeance-seeking minion
of the law he had become a person very
anxious to oblige of course burling-
tons aid had been all-powerful and the
production of the pocketbook had sub-
stantiated the story yet at the back of
the change in osgood had been that
folded bill under the star after all
ones point of view largely depends on
the cash in hand thought quentin

  he reckoned without his host how-
ever at this instant the detective
paused and directed a puzzled look to-
ward him

  say i clear forgot about that girl

maybe the other doc here can straighten
that up too-i mean that there miss
elsmere you was toting around

  eh whats that miss elsmere
burlington halted suddenly his heavy
jaw falling as he stared at osgood

  quentins face went white now the
fat was in the fire indeed suspicion
had darted swiftly into the detectives
face once more burlington was star-
ing from one to the other of them in
bewildered surmise and quentin saw
that the show-down was imminent with
no sign of mathews in guise of rescuer
however since mary palmer had dis-
appeared it did not matter

  never mind this chump burling-
ton said quentin hastily hes a bit
twisted about things-

  not much  exclaimed the physician
savagely his ugly jaw shoving out
this detective has been in touch with
the young woman and i intend to find
out about it now my man i want
to know where you heard the name of
miss elsmere

  quentin subsided the game was up
indeed and he would need all his ener-
gies if he was to come out of the thing
decently he suddenly perceived that
burlington would be an exceedingly
ugly customer to deal with

  i dont know a whole lot doc an-
swered the detective slowly this
here friend of yours can tell you more
than i can i was sent from headquar-
ters to nab a woman thief like i told
you i spotted a blind girl with this
guy on the boat yesterday cornin over
from pedro i butted in and asked the
skirts name this guy answers up that
its miss enid elsmere and says who
he is so i thinks maybe ive made a
mistake thats all i know about the
lady except what come after like i told
you

  during this brief recital burlingtons
face became black with suspicion and
suppressed rage when osgood fin-
ished he whirled on quentin but for


new story magazine

all his anger there was a hint of fear
in the darting blue eyes

  quentin you met miss elsmere on
the boat he exclaimed forcing him-
self into calm quentin seeing that he
still held a lash over the older man
smiled slightly although his eyes hard-
ened

  i did not he returned flatly nor
did i see anything of her

  burlington gasped and took a step
forward with outstretched fist baffled
fury in his face

  dont lie to me quentin he

stormed im no-

  look here and the cold acid of
quentins voice bit through his vehe-
mence and quieted him i dont propose
to be called a liar by you burlington
this thing can be explained but i want
an apology from you for that word and
i want it now

 osgood grinned furtively as he lis-
tened the steely note in quentins
voice which had failed to warn the de-
tective on the previous evening had its
effect on burlington whose eyes rested
on quentins the younger mans icy
coldness pierced burlingtons rage and
sobered him on the instant

  i didnt mean to be hasty quentin
he retracted but theres something
behind all this and im going to get to
it have you been trying to play with
me sir why have you been conceal-
ing your knowledge of this young lady
and pretending to help me in seeking
for her

  osgood suddenly remembered his
personal property and the effects of the
twenty-dollar bill faded out he pushed
forward facing quentin with swift
truculence

  say wheres my money and the
stuff you took from me hey this

thing aint beei squared up yet-

  oh shut up broke out quentin
and at the flame in his eyes osgood re-
treated a pace your stuff is at the
hotel desk waiting for you now get

out of this and let me settle matters
with burlington your injuries are
wholly personal and youll find your
money all safe and sound

  he impatiently shoved the burly de-
tective aside but burlington had not
yet done with the man catching his
arm he whirled him about

  see here osgood-what was this
blind girl like whom you saw with
quentin on the boat

  the detective gave prompt reply

  she had fluffy brown hair wore a
white tailored suit and was neat as a
pin the dip  was after had played

the fine lady so-

  what youre sure her hair was
not black was she tall or short
tall doc tall and fair

  good heavens burlington took a
step back brushing a hand across his
eyes in bewilderment osgoods tone
was too positive to admit of doubt and
quentin laughed shortly

  you see burlington the girl os-
good saw with me was miss palmer and
no other now lets get out of this-
we can go to my room at the hotel and
ill have it out with you if you want it
wait cried burlington hoarsely
staring at him why did you give her
miss elsmeres name how had you
heard anything of miss elsmere if
her name was palmer why did you
lie to osgood about it 

  by thunder thats right doc
blurted out the detective whirling an-
grily on ouentin so you gave me a
bum steer eh i guess we aint out
of the woods on this thing yet bo
now come across lively or therell be
trouble

  quentin gave him a contemptuous
look the gathering crowd irritated
him for he had no mind to expose his
hand in public and since the thing had
to come out he determined to take the
aggressive before burlington had a
chance to do so
a discord in avalon



  all right he said shortly facing
burlington if you want it straight
my friend you can have it ive been
doing a heap of lying this morning
burlington and it ends right here i
happen to know all about enid elsmere
your villainy in connection with her
your keeping her hidden away in your
house and all the rest of it whats
more youve got to move mighty softly
if youre going to side-step the biggest
scandal that ever woke up this part of
the world

  his quiet but intense words had all
the effect for which he could have
wished the big physicians bloodshot
face went white as he listened then
became mottled again  he breathed ster-
torously and there was terror in his
wild stare but it was the terror of des-
peration his square jaw clamped shut
swiftly and when quentin had finished
he seemed suddenly to regain the air
of masterful poise which had been
stripped from him

  seeing that transformation quentin
knew that it boded trouble burlington
was desperate the fact that quentin
knew his secret meant exposure and
disgrace for him and social ruin at the
least for a moment he did not reply
while the amazed osgood stood looking
from one to the other in questioning
conjecture quentins abrupt change
from defense to attack had set him all
adrift

  lets get out of this exclaimed
burlington once more becoming aware
of the crowd his sudden calm was
anything but reassuring quentin we
cant settle this thing here in the street
come along to your room at the hotel

  here i guess ill trot along broke
in osgood as burlington took a step
away quentin hesitated

  this matter is between ourselves
he began but the physician swung
around with a savage oath

 no by- osgood you come

along with us and see this thing

through i fancy ill have some use
for you in a mighty short time

  and catching his malevolent look
quentin led the way to the hotel with
foreboding in his heart he could not
fathom burlingtons intent but he saw
that the man was dangerous-terribly
dangerous and the more so for his
forced calm

chapter xii

  there was a strained silence on all
three of the men as they strode into the
hotel lobby osgood went over to the
desk and quentin followed him while
the detective was getting the envelope
containing his personal belongings
quentin made inquiries after the girl
he found that she had not returned
and doubted no longer that she was the
pickpocket and had seized the chance
to get away osgood looked up at him
with a grin

  well doc i aint got any hard feel-
ings i guess youre square after all
but whats the row between you and
the other doc

  quentin glanced across at burling-
ton who was waiting by the elevator
and shrugged his shoulders

  come along and see if im not
much mistaken youll be able to make
an arrest yet osgood

  as they crossed back and rejoined
burlington quentin determined to
force the issue squarely what the
points of the law were he did not
know but he fancied that he could at
least make a charge against the long
beach man which would force the mat-
ter into the courts there was no doubt
that in some manner mary palmer had
learned burlingtons secret perhaps
through the under channels used by
crooks to obtain such knowledge the
thought that she was indeed a thief
struck quentin hard but he knew now
that the story was true enough

  with tense silence still prevailing


new story magazine

among the three they reached quen-
tins room burlington dropped into a
chair smoothed back his graying hair
in his most precise fashion and faced
quentin

  now sir he said breathing hard
but forcing himself into self-control
you will kindly explain your veiled
charges against me i am bitterly sur-
prised in you allan quentin and un-
less you make a satisfactory explana-
tion you shall suffer for it

  i do not intend to explain re-
turned quentin coldly that will come
from you i suppose you will admit
that enid elsmere is your ward and
that owing to her affliction you have the
use of her income

  yes you scoundrel burst out the
other quivering with rage ill not
only admit it but ill make you admit
where you got that information
quentin smiled

  by your own words you confess
that you have kept the matter quiet
burlington your friends know nothing
of her being in your house youve de-
liberately attempted to keep her seques-
tered so that you might enjoy her
money youve lied to her about her
condition and since you told me this
morning that the girl you were after
had a brain tumor a simple operation
would have fixed her up the courts
may have given you control of her
burlington but i doubt whether youll
keep it long

  with that he turned to osgood who
was chewing an unlit cigar

  i dont know what charge covers
this case osgood but i guess you un-
derstand enough of the situation now
i demand that you arrest doctor bur-
lington there on my charge and i will
appear against him the girl has es-
caped from his hands and shell be
located quickly enough when this thing
gets into the open

  osgood reached down into his pocket
and produced his handcuffs hesitantly

  well doc i aint quite sure myself
but ill take a chance-

  not so fast there burlington
leaped to his feet quickly i intend to
lay a charge here myself osgood you
saw quentin with a presumably blind
girl yesterday whom he passed off as
miss elsmere since youve heard what
has passed between us you know that
miss elsmere was my ward by legal
right and if ive thought fit to keep
her secluded thats my affair and not
yours ive been trying to cure her
without an operation-

  and youve been three years doing
it broke in quentin hotly

  confound you shut up roared
burlington osgood arrest that man
i charge him with conspiracy and at-
tempted blackmail he and that pre-
tended charge of his whom he passed
off  you as miss elsmere and on me
as miss palmer are in this thing to-
gether i charge them with kidnaping
my ward and getting her out of the way
in a conspiracy to extort money from
me ill fix you you damned scoun-
drel 

  quentins mouth tightened into a set
line as he faced the other longing to
plant his fist on the big jaw burling-
ton acted out his part well helped by
the furious rage which consumed him
the young surgeon saw that osgood
was wavering and perceived at once
that burlington had managed to turn
the tables on him very neatly

  also he knew what the others did
not-that mary palmer had slipped
away that she was the dip for whom
osgood was looking and that when
this complication came out the charge
made by burlington would be tre-
mendously strengthened on the whole
things looked pretty black he thought

  the others did not know this how-
ever and there was still a chance to
bluff his way through safely burling-
tons charge was also bluff but with
skill it could be turned into a thing of
a discord in avalon



reality quentin alone knew how real
it might be when the facts about mary
palmer were brought to light

  look here osgood he said fight-
ing for time doctor burlington has
been going all over the island this morn-
ing hunting for miss elsmere-

  thought you said that skirt with you
was the lady put in the detective
bluntly

  i did-but her real name was mary
palmer i knew that burlington would
be after his ward who had escaped
and i merely wanted to lay a blind trail
that might deceive him in that way
the girl would have time to reach
friends now theres the situation by
his own words and actions burlington
has proved that hes been attempting
malpractice ill add that to my charges
as well if itll do any good

  you scoundrel flamed burling-
ton taking a step toward quentin his
fists waving threateningly you
neednt try to get out of your scrape
by laying charges against me officer
either arrest that fellow or ill have
you broke

  osgood grinned slightly

  i guess not doc-itll take more
than a pair of you to break bert os-
good one of you guys has to be ar-
rested i guess but as fars i can see
the odds are even why dont you
toss up a coin and settle it the only
thing i can see is to pull the both of
you and let you scrap it out with the
desk sergeant

  ouentin laughed as his sense of
humor awoke to the occasion burling-
ton however was only maddened the
more

  confound it do i have to arrest him
myself ill call in the officials here
unless you act at once get hold of
his woman accomplice and do it lively
if you refuse to arrest him ill take
care of the scoundrel

  that suits me and osgood rubbed
his jaw with a reflective grin at quen-

tin thats a good idea doc wheres
that lady pal of yours

   quentin gave up osgoods keen per-
ception had pierced to the nub of things
-which happened to be mary palmer
-and there was no use putting off the
inevitable any longer

   had not burlington interfered at this
junction quentin would simply have
placed the whole affair in the detectives
hands and let things take their course
but at osgoods exclamation burling-
ton hastily turned toward the door with
savage determination in his features

   ill attend to her myself he de-
clared hotly you take care of quen-
tin and ill bring the woman here-

   with this quentins cold restraint
gave way deciding instantly that he
would at least have the satisfaction of
putting burlington in his place he
darted forward and whirled in front of
the door with a swift push that sent
burlington staggering back

   thats enough from you he cried
his eyes flaming youre not going to
bully any more women burlington-
unless you do it inside states prison
the other leaned against the table a
second glaring and panting heavily in
that instant quentin knew that he must
subdue or go under burlingtons pow-
erful face expressed determination to
silence him at whatever cost the whole
future of each man depended upon the
outcome

  yet in burlingtons face quentin
read a swift cunning that he could not
fathom a purpose which was hidden
from him he was soon to learn its
import however

   get away from that door quentin
snapped the older man stepping for-
ward once more bear witness that
im only trying to get out of this room

osgood-

  goaded beyond endurance quentin
wasted no more words burlington
came at him and without hesitation he
drove out his fist the blow caught the


new story magazine

other on the cheek and sent him reeling
but burlington attempted no return

  arrest him-for assault he
gasped clinging to a chair too late
quentin saw the plan but he gave os-
good  chance to intervene he had
played into his enemys hand but he de-
termined to do it thoroughly while he
was about it

  with a swift step forward he sent
his fist crashing into burlingtons
mouth and the larger man bent back
across the table he writhed away but
again quentins knuckles found him
this time for a clean blow under the ear
burlington shot headfirst into the cor-
ner and quentin found the burly de-
tective gripping his arms

  easy does it doc-easy does it
exclaimed osgood firmly quentin
looked him in the eye half wrenched
away then the cold flame of anger died
out of his face and he laughed shortly

  all right osgood ill not touch
you or him either let go

  youre under arrest sir said the
other quietly stepping back now
lets see what you did to the big doc
say youve got a great little kick in
that right of yours look at him
quentin looked down at burlington 
who was slowly gaining his feet and
noted with great satisfaction that the
three blows he had landed would leave
their marks for some time the detec-
tive pulled up the fallen physician and
shoved him into a chair but burling-
ton staggered up still furious

  by - put that  man under ar-
rest he foamed beside himself with

rage hes assaulted me-

  ive got him under arrest doc said
osgood forcing him back into the chair
now you sit down and cool off a
minute

  im cool enough my man retorted
burlington youd better get hold of
the woman and arrest her also  my
charge

  youd better not osgood put in
quentin calmly

  the detective coolly disregarded him
and stepped to the wall telephone

  what name does she go under here
-whats her alias doc he asked
turning toward quentin the latter
gave up the struggle

  miss elsmere

  while osgood was communicating
with the office quentin stared disgust-
edly at the floor he had made a fine
mess of things now he reflected he
had virtually forced himself under ar-
rest the hand of circumstance had
clutched about his neck and burlington
would have little difficulty iii making
good his charge of conspiracy when the
whole miserable story had been dragged
into court

  after all what had he on which to
base his own charges nothing but the
word of a woman he did not know
and who was herself a fugitive from
justice combined with some trifling cir-
cumstantial evidence which burlington
could easily explain away still there
would be court records of burlingtons
guardianship but unless the real enid
elsmere was to be produced as a wit-
ness against him burlington would have
an easy time squirming out of quen-
tins charge-especially when the latter
had been placed under arrest for as-
sault and might be facing a hatched-up
conspiracy charge

  say exclaimed osgood turning
from the telephone with a black look
i guess you done me out of pinching
that dip after all doc she went out
o here this morning about as blind as
i am

  what roared burlington leaping
up is she gone

  gone is right big doc osgood was
far recovered from the influence of that
twenty-dollar bill by this time and
showed it plainly but i got this guy
and i got him right now doc slip out
a discord in avalon



your wrists for the bracelets and no
fooling

  quentin beyond words put out his
hands as osgood came up there was
a clink and a click and the handcuffs
w-ere upon him at this instant the
telephone bell rang and osgood an-
swered it

  sure he said quickly send em
up

  he hung up the receiver and turned
with a grin

  its all right doc he said ad-
dressing burlington that there wom-
an were after just came in and shell
be up here in a jiffy well nab em
both at once

  quentin looked up then dropped his
head with a groan the whole thing
had been useless-mary palmer had
returned only to walk into a trap and
he was powerless to save her or him-
self from the toils that he saw fast
closing about them both

  a moment later there was a knock
at the door burlington started up but
the detective waved him back with a
confident grin and moved over so that
he was in position to grip whoever
entered

  come in he cried and the door
opened

chapter xiii

  yesm youre pinched grinned
osgood with his hand on the shoulder
of mary palmer she faced him seem-
ingly without surprise and quentin saw
that she had given over all pretense of
blindness

  on a charge of conspiracy young
woman thundered out burlington im-
pressively as he came down the room
wagging his forefinger officer i
shall appear before both of these per-
sons-

  i dont think you will burlington
came a voice from the doorway and
then silence fell suddenly and burling-
ton stood as if paralyzed

  looking at the doorway quentin
saw there an elderly man of command-
ing presence whose southern goatee
fairly bristled with indignation one
arm was about the shoulders of a girl
-and quentin emitted a gasp as he
saw that she was clad in red with black
hair that flew over her shoulders

  come in uncle jim said mary
palmer quietly this is doctor quen-
tin who seems to be once more under
arrest and she flashed quentin a
bright smile doctor this is my uncle
mr mathews and this-is enid els-
mere

  burlington said no word but col-
lapsed into the chair behind him his
fingers clawing at the table and his
face suddenly gone to a mottled hue

  and this went on the girl mo-
tioning toward the detective is the
mr osgood of whom i told you uncle

  quentin rose smiling

  sorry i cant shake hands mr
mathews he said and the tension was
broken

  take those handcuffs off doctor
quentin osgood ordered mathews
putting enid elsmere behind him and
advancing the girl stood weeping her
face in her hands i think you know
me sir

  why-yes mr mathews gasped
the detective with unexpected defer-
ence i didnt forget that murder case

  then do as i say

  sorry sir and osgood shook his
head this gentleman assaulted the
big doc over there and i had to pinch
him whether i wanted to or not
mathews whirled on the crumpled
figure in the chair

  withdraw that charge burlington
and do it quickly

  at the cold menace in his voice bur-
lington shivered gasped and nodded
at the detective a moment later quen-
tin rubbed his wrists and osgood stood

with the handcuffs dangling looking
from one to the other in perplexity

  arrest this man burlington went
on mathews but before he could finish
the other sprang up with a choking
cry

  no-no for gods sake mathews
not that

  sit down-shut up you hound or
ill thrash you myself exploded
mathews and burlington crumpled up
again utterly unnerved now lets
get this thing straight

  mary palmer had her arms about the
blind girl and as quentin stepped over
and glanced into the latters face he
knew that here there was no deception
then he looked at mary palmer-and
found the violet eyes smiling into his

  what does all this mean he asked
slowly at the question mathews
turned to him and motioned mary
palmer to speak the girl laughed hap-
pily glancing from osgood back to
quentin and addressing both at once
in her rather confused explanation-
which was perfectly clear to both how-
ever

  why my uncle-mr mathews here
-was to meet me in los angeles on
my way from phoenix to visit him i
missed him and came on alone at
san pedro i found poor enid here
afraid to speak to any one and when
i asked her what the matter was she
burst into tears and told me the whole
story-just as i told it to you doctor
quentin i did not know what to do
but the poor girl was helpless and in
distress and said she wanted to find
my uncle who would protect her she
was afraid that doctor burlington
would come after her so i found a
policeman and asked him if he would
take care of her

  he happened to know my uncle by
sight andhad seen him that morning
-yesterday but now it seems a year
ago he promised to take care of

enid and to hand her over to my uncle
when he came back after having missed
me and i went on the boat to go on
to the island then i saw you mr
osgood and you looked at me so hard
that-that it made me afraid and-
and-

  and so you made up to me and
played blind eh laughed quentin
suddenly he understood the whole
thing mathews had arrived at san
pedro on his way back had been met
by the policeman and the real enid
and had hastened over to the island
that explained the message which
had come for mary palmer and why
she had gone out upon meeting
mathews she had brought him back-
and what about the pickpocket  quen-
tin whirled on the detective smiling

  i guess you lose out on your lady
dip prisoner osgood kind of bad
on your reputation isnt it

  oh i dont know and the detec-
tive rubbed at his chin as he cast a
glance at the crumpled figure in the
chair as nears i get you mr
mathews im to pinch the big doc over
there eh

  weeping unrestrainedly the blind
girl loosed her arms from around mary
palmer and turned with a little plead-
ing gesture that was terribly pathetic

  no she cried her voice choked
with sobs please mr mathews

please dont-

  all right little girl all right and
mathews gathered her in his arms for
a moment comforting her then as
lie lifted his head and gazed across her
streaming black hair his voice bit into
the crumpled figure

  burlington get out of here this
guardianship shall be turned over to
me by the courts unless you do it of
your own will inside of three days
now-get out and do it quick

  the big man rose heavily despite
his anger despite the swift attempt to
a discord in avalon



ruin him which had so nearly suc-
ceeded quentin felt a thrill of pity as
he looked on the mans ghastly face
burlington appeared utterly crushed
and the terrific mental agony stamped
in his features was too much for the
younger man quentin took an impul-
sive step forward

  i dont think any of us want much
publicity out of this burlington for
the sake of your wife and dolly ill
see that the whole thing is kept quiet

 the other did not reply with a
pitiful effort at self-possession he tried
to recover his old pompous manner
failed dismally took the silk hat
handed him by the grinning osgood
and the door slammed mathews looked
over at quentin with a twinkle in his
eye

  you seem confident of your ability
to hush this thing up young man

  i am retorted quentin provided

that osgood will keep quiet-

  oh im satisfied murmured the
detective easily im used to keeping
my head shut doc but you cant al-
ways tell about a lady- and he

glanced meaningly at mary palmer

  no she added merrily how do
you propose to shut my mouth doctor
quentin 

  well and quentin smiled into her
eyes i do know one very effective
method of doing it but ive only
known you one day-and there are

other folks around-

  dont mind me doc exclaimed os-
good hastily and the door slammed
again



the girl

by john fleming wiln

vie had met on the little launch that
runs across the channel from
san pedro to east san pedro and we
were glad to see each other for it was
cold and lonely and neither of us knew
anybody in the port

  im just in from shanghai murray
told me i brought the schooner
seahome over

  good voyage i asked glancing at
his freshly shaven brown face

  fair he returned shes a good
old packet i hoped to meet the girl
again but shes gone

  the girl v i demanded what
girl

  the girl that was in love with tan-
tor martin he replied she was so
good and kind and beautiful i really
hoped to see her again

  i never heard of her i returned
i believe i did get a hint that that
pirate was in love with some woman or
other-after hating all women-but i
didnt hear enough to startle me
captain murray looked at me grave-
ly it was really an affair he re-
marked getting to his feet as the launch
swung up to the float funny you
never heard of it come on over to
the hanalei and ill tell you about it
i did hope to see her


new story magazine

  presently we were in his little state-
room on the steamer and murray lit
his pipe he bore an expression of
sadness that touched me i who had
known him for many years as a care-
free sailor i saw that he was deeply
moved

  yes tantor martin forgot all his
hatred of women because of this girl
he said simply i wish she had loved
me and yet i dont regret the affair
it was quite beautiful

  i shouldnt expect that brute to have
been concerned in anything that one
might describe as beautiful i com-
mented he was born to be a pirate
the man was a savage

  and the fine part of it all is that he
was a pirate in a good cause and made
others of us pirates murray said
quietly listen

  you remember that tantor got into
trouble with the owners of the tam
oshanter for holding up poor captain
dare of the mildmay for five thousand
dollars when the mildmay was off the
rocks up at cape blanco it was plain
brutality for dare was incompetent
and his ship was a sure loss unless mar-
tin gave him a hawser and towed him
out tantor despised dare and as it
was the mildmay was in the breakers
when tantor finally put a line aboard
and hauled him out to sea dare signed
for five thousand plain piracy on tan-
tors part his owners wouldnt stand
for it

  they gave the tam oshanter to
richardson martin shook his fist in
the boss face and swore he had made
five thousand for him only to be cheat-
ed of his share you know he was a
rough customer tantor you remem-
ber the time he was mate of the
gleaner and nearly got ten years at
hard labor for beating the captain
well he told his owners that he would
make them sorry

  some day ill take my five thousand

  back he said i made it fair and
square and you accept it and then dis-
charge me because dare makes a fuss
he was going to ipse his hundred thou-
sand dollar ship i save it for the poor
wretch and you listen to the papers
and let me go

  as a matter of fact i met tantor an
hour later and gave him a job-mate
of the witch of endor when i was
skipper of her and we were in the coast-
wise trade to puget sound good
mate tantor i got to appreciate him
and when hed been with me six
months this girl wanders down to the
wharf while were lying here in san
pedro and tantor sees her and the af-
fair begins

  she was a lovely creature name of
laws-gertrude laws from up the
country she was shed been to school
and had come down to los angeles to
study to be a teacher one afternoon
she thought shed like to see a ship and
took the trolley down here the witch
of endors masts are sticking up into
the blue sky and she traipses down to
see her tantor was sitting on the
wheel box telling me that ships and
women were the two evils in life

  ill never speak to a woman again
he growls

  please may i come and see your
ship says a voice from the wharf

  i looked over and there stands a big
handsome kid of a girl with her hair
blowing about her face and one brown
hand holding on her cap

  i dont know just what made me do
it but i jumped up and told her to
come aboard

  keep em off the ship says tantor
not lifting his eyes twenty years
ago a woman turned me down and i
never-

  the girl tripped up the plank and
stopped to stare up at the yards i
saw that she was about eighteen years
old and innocent as a baby

please says she as frank as the
the girl



wind ive never seen a ship where
are the sails all the pictures of ships
have sails

  madam says tantor in his ugliest
voice you mean that the ships you see
in pictures have sails

  she paused and looked at him i
could see her eyes light up with a little
twinkling gleam like the firelight on
your wifes eyes i never can get my
grammar and my curiosity to fit in to-
gether she said isnt that terrible
for a girl thats going to be a school-
teacher 

  tantor turned those hard grim eyes
of his on her and got up i could see
that he was suddenly changed i dont
know just how youd explain it but
there was something about the way he
looked at her that told me shed altered
his point of view he went down on
the main deck with her and showed her
all about the witch i could hear em
talking and now and then thered float
up to the quarter-deck where i was sit-
ting that little tinkling pretty laugh of
hers

  thinks i tantor never behaved that
way before and when they ame back
to the quarter-deck and i saw him
smile in answer to her smile i felt that
something had happened

  it wasnt a week before tantor mar-
tin came to me and said he was going
to marry gertrude laws

  you  i roared at him that girls
as clean and dainty as a morning-glory
and youre nothing but a hard-fisted
mean-tempered bad-livered sailor
honest it got me for the moment id
seen quite a bit of the girl and i-i
liked her she was as fresh and whole-
some as a breeze across an orchard and
she was beautiful too with that strange
loveliness that changes and has little
shadows of sadness about it and little
lights of passion and all very girlish
and natural and innocent

  yes says he im going to marry
her ill try and get another ship or

live ashore but i think i can get a

ship

  well i returned if she agrees and
her people agree i spose nobody else
has any say

  her people he says quietly she
hasnt any-only an aunt shes all
alone in this world and you and i
know its no place for a lone girl
when are you going to be mar-
ried i asked

  i havent asked her yet he told me
slowly i just wanted you to under-
stand ill ask her to-night

  you know perfectly well that tantor
martin wasnt a man to laugh at he
was mortally in earnest and i kept my
mouth shut

  shes going to the show with me
to-night he went on and ill bring
her down here for supper she thinks
there ought to be some third person
when we eat together so i told her you
were skipper of the ship and youd eat
with us

  thanks says i actually forgetting
to call him down

  and if anybody thinks he can make
any remarks about her he goes on
ill show him something

  the only remark i have to make is
that you have enough nerve to stock
a battleship i returned tell the
cook to give us a good spread

  nothing to drink you know he
continued she dont like it

  sure i told him

  and no rough language about
youre still mate of this packet and
thats up to you i remarked

  and that evening just about sunset
she came down with tantor striding
alongside of her it was a pretty sight
big coarse tantor with a new look on
his face and the girl laughing up at
him and glancing at the shipping and
the sky and the crisp water with bright
eyes

we had a supper fit for a king old
cookee certainly outdid himself and


new story magazine

waited on us with such officiousness
that gertrude simply had to shake hands
with him over the dessert the cook
nearly died of pleasure

  when it was full dark i took tantor
and gertrude up on the quarter-deck
and he showed her all the harbor lights
while i smoked my pipe then i told
em to enjoy themselves on deck-it
was a fine night-and went over to
visit captain nelson on the beaver

  nelson and i had a yarn and then
i wandered back to the witch of endor

i could see the watchmans lantern
burning under the break of the focsle
head and the glimmer of the lamp in
the cooks room amidships i stopped
under the bulwarks a moment to look
at the stars and wonder why a sailors
life is so lonely i heard voices it was
the girl and tantor above me on the
quarter-deck

  i want to teach school she was
saying in her fresh girlish voice

  and youve got to marry me says
he quite gently for him

  but she protested i dont want
to get married

  yes you do martin puts in and
ill tell you why because i love you
and i cant bear to see you alone in
the world and im strong enough to
look after you

  well i stepped away for a while
and when i came back tantor wras just
coming ashore with the girl on his arm
he was happy and she was happy
too they merely called good night to
me and hurried off to catch the trolley

  we had to lie in san pedro for a
long time that trip waiting for a cargo
for seattle and all that time tantor
worked and acted like a man whod
thought himself in torment and sudden-
ly found that he was in heaven ger-
trude used to come down to the ship
every afternoon and theyd sit on a
stringer and talk i knew that trouble
was coming but what business was it
of mine

  you see burton of the hazel saw
all this and he fell in love with the
girl too you knew him-a smooth
quiet dangerous fellow he was aw-
fully nice to gertrude and she being
that kind of girl that likes everybody
and knows no evil took him for what
he professed to be and she made
tantor martin smile at him tantor
even forget his old grudge against bur-
ton though he remembered that burton
had been no friend of his during the
time they were thrashing out the little
matter of the tam oshanter and cap-
tain dare

  then burton began openly to make
love to the girl she suddenly found
out what lie was doing and ive never
seen such a pitiful sight

  oh youre in love with me she
cried out one evening when tantor and
i were busy in the cabin over some
papers and she was enjoying the air
on the wharf

  at the sound of the words martin
leaped up

  keep still i warned him we
both listened

   it is so lovely to be in love and so
terrible to be in love wrong she went
on i could fairly see the tears in her
lovely eyes and youre in love with
me and i cant help you at all im so
sorry

  sit still i told tantor remem-
ber that every mans love is his own
affair leave it to her

  so we sat there-forgetting the pa-
pers-and listened i suppose burtons
black heart really beat for her she was
so pure and kind and gentle at any
rate he was in earnest and went away
at last in silence

  now said i go and dont let her
understand that you overheard she is
sorry for him

  martin left and i heard her run to
him and ask him to take her back to
los angeles a moment later they
were gone
the girl



  all the next day tantor brooded over
the thing he went about his work
much like he had done in the old days-
with curses on his lips and ugly looks
for those who crossed him that night
he told me she wouldnt come down
that evening

  natural i said my heavens do
you expect the girl to be here every
night i dont notice you calling where
she lives

  it wouldnt do he told me shes
living at some womans hotel where
men cant call without getting the ma-
tron down on them she doesnt know
it but i do and i wouldnt have any-
thing happen to make her even think of
the wrong things that so many people
think he looked at me with those
grim eyes of his and added so long
as i live shell never even have to listen
to suggestions of what life can be made
when one is wicked

  he was right and i said nothing he
was protecting the purity of her love
for him the gentle and pure rffection
that was like an altar candle in her
heart tantor martin was decent he
wasnt even urging her to marry him
quickly because he was afraid the
girl-the woman one loves-is sacred-
even when one marries her-i under-
stood tantor

  but burtons love for her had turned
to something infernal it showed that
martin was right in hating him he
went to the girl and told her-stories
he invited her on board the hazel and
she went like a friendly child there
he said more the things that burned
and scorched the girl she said noth-
ing but went to her boarding place in
los angeles and confided in the ma-
tron some good women unlock the
doors of hell without knowing it she
dragged the whole story of gertrudes
engagement to tantor out and said the
single thing you have compromised
yourself no good girl would go down

    

to a ship and meet a sailor without
being a bad woman pack your things

  it was a cruel thing to say under any
circumstances but women dont un-
derstand other women i guess that
excellent matron did not know that
gertrude wouldnt couldnt go to tan-
tor - she had put the stain on their
pure and lovely relations the girl was
sickened at the thought that she was
unworthy of tantor-that she had
soiled the pure character she must have
to be his wife she thought-its the
way women think-that what that ma-
tron had said was true she was not fit
to be the wife of a good man

  she went to burton

  was it because she knew him to be
a beast and a scoundrel was it be-
cause she thought that she was sinful
and no other course was open except
to go to people stained like herself  or
was it because she wished to forever
shut herself out of the heaven she had
forfeited you and i cant tell but
she went down to burton and told him
what the matron had said and he
smiled and then frowned and told her
that though every one else turned her
down he loved her and she could come
to him and be protected

  he sailed that night for honolulu

  it was four oclock in the morning
when martin kicked my door in and
told me he had been up to the board-
ing place and the matron had informed
him of what she had said and done
tantor listened and cursed the woman
then he came back to san pedro and
found burton had sailed and that the
girl was on board

  im going for her he told me

  how i demanded

  this packet wont do the hazel
can steam twelve and burtons making
time offshore i know the only
packet in port that can catch him is
the tam oshanter come with me
well take her

  i sat up and argued with him i


new story magazine

told him plainly that he hadnt money
enough nor had i to charter that steam-
er for a wild-goose chase

  and she belongs to the men who
kicked you out i added

  he glowered on me will you come
with me to save the girl i hear her
crying out there

  he waved his great hand toward the
pacific and it seemed as if i did actual-
ly hear a woman sobbing

  i tried to do something with him
but he was mad the end of it was i
dressed and we went down the water
front to the tam oshanter which was
lying with steam up ready to sail in the
morning

  luckily the captain was ashore else
we would have had more trouble as it
was tantor raged aboard got the en-
gineer into a blue funk and himself cast
off the lines while the mate and deck
hands-who knew him of old-feebly
protested

  it was as plain a case of piracy as
ever you saw we simply seized that
ship and went to sea in a dark mist
that filled the channel with murky shad-
ows that made the course to dead
mans island a mystery tantor was
at the wheel we barely missed the
government dredge and tailed on the
bar-we were beyond the islands an
hour after sunrise

  it was noon when the crew of the
tam oshanter wakened to the fact
that they were in charge of a skipper
who had no business on their ship and
that they were bound for honolulu in-
stead of puget sound the mate and
the chief engineer put their heads to-
gether and tried to reason with tantor
i am ashamed to say that i backed him
up-there was no more trouble the
tam oshanter made a good fifteen
knots an hour with double watches in
the fireroom martin kept the wheel

  late that night we saw the stern light
of the hazel a mere flicker of flame
on the horizon

  i knew id catch him tantor said
hoarsely i used to make this old
packet log sixteen knots when i
dragged old dare out of the breakers
off blanco i had fifty pounds more than
allowed in the boilers and i knew
what course that burton would take
keep the wheel while i see about a
boat

  what do you intend to do i de-
manded burton wont stop for you
youre absolutely crazy all you can
do is follow him

  is that so retorted martin
watch me i leave you in charge of
this packet i have work to do and
im going to do it

  slowly almost imperceptibly we
crept up on that little light that marked
where the girl was crying at four in
the morning it was less than a mile
ahead tantor had been raging up and
down the decks using his fists and his
tongue to such effect that the mate of
the tam oshanter had taken to his
room and refused to come out

  it was a raw dark misty morning
such as one gets off the lower coast of
california once in a while the sea was
running along in great smooth rollers
that seemed to stream in endless array
out of the blackness and hasten toward
the invisible shore the tam oshan-
ter was shaking to the tremendous
thrust of her engines

  in half an hour well be up to them
i told tantor

  ill take the bridge then he said
understand obey my orders to the
word when im done you take
charge

  we surged along and i caught once
in a while the glint of the white water
under the counter of the hazel at
other moments i would catch the shad-
ow of fresh smoke against the lowering
sky by her masthead light and the
lights along her starboard side i could
see that she was heading up evidently
the girl



trying to make us buck the light sea
that was running

  in fifteen minutes ill show you
something said tantor thrusting his
head in at the wheelhouse window

  for the first time i studied the mans
face youve seen him hes a pirate
as you say i fancy columbus looked
as he did when his crew mutinied cap-
tain columbus was a pirate they dont
say it in the schoolbooks but a man
whod seize a whole hemisphere must
have been some person and tantor
martin was seizing a whole world just
then i stuck to the wheel

  keep to starboard of him he told
me grimly

   i did

  i think that burton realized at the
last that tantor was after him i sup-
pose he was afraid anyway and when
lie had first seen our lights he had put
on more steam but now the hazel
simply leaped through the long purple
swells i could see the glimmer of the
water breaking over her bows and
down below in the bowels of the tam
oshanter the firemen wielded shovels
and slice bars so vigorously that i could
hear the clang of them in the wheel-
house

  it was nip and tuck for the next
hour then the hazel began to slow
down and we forged up i steered in
toward her tantor banged the weather
window open and said keep away
to starboard

  but you vant to get alongside i
protested

  you do what i tell you he said
glaring at me i did we kept to the
norard

  it was in the gray of the dawn that
we passed the hazel it was clear as
water that burton thought he had been
wrong and that we werent after him
he slacked down his engines and as
the sun rose we were a mile ahead of
him i could hear tantor raging back
and forth on the bridge overhead then

the trap hatch opened and he called
down  starboard your helm 

  i put the wheel over slowly and the
tam oshanter rolled around till the
swells that were running out the north-
west were broad on the bow the hazel
was then on the port beam and coming
slowly along  heard the jangle of the
engine-room telegraph as i steadied
her on the new course i saw that we
were going to cross the hazels bows
then the telegraph rang again and the
throb of the machinery ceased the
tam oshanter rolled slowly in the
trough of the sea

  i think that nothing of what was to
happen entered my head i think i still
heard vaguely the sobbing of a woman
it seems as if that was the general im-
pression i got while i waited i think
i also heard the tramp of tantor mar-
tin on the bridge

  the thing that stands out most
clearly in my mind is the sudden real-
ization that the hazel was steaming
along within a quarter of a mile and
that we were slowly but steadily mak-
ing toward her we rolling in the hollow
of the sea it suddenly occurred to me
that we were going to cross her bows
if the engines started tantor was tak-
ing chances

  and then came the sharp clang of
the telegraph-full speed ahead the
answer came from the chief and i felt
the vessel slowly regain her speed i
eased the wheel wondering whether we
should pass astern of the hazel or
range alongside

  you must understand thatr it was a
beautiful morning the sun had risen
and burned up the mist the swell rolled
eastward with a slow and powerful
sweep the sky above us was clear and
crystalline there was not even a cir-
cling gull to catch the eye

  i eased the helm a little more the
hazel was drawing closer and i could
see burtons figure on the bridge he
had his glasses fixed on us it was per-


new story magazine

fectly clear that he was puzzled i
saw him turn and consult his mate
then lie leaped to the center of the
bridge and pulled the whistle cord be-
fore the plume of steam had vanished
in the pellucid air i heard the sound
of the warning blast

  instantly i was shaken by the bellow
of our own siren and then i under-
stood that sound throbbing upward
into the beautiful air was the call of a
man to his mate i caught the roar of
tantors voice telling me to keep my
course i did

  i can still see the great blank black
side of the hazel as she gave us her
unprotected flank i can still see the
tam oshunters powerful bows thrust
downward and into her heart then
came shouts the ringing of gongs the
slow steady pulse of the engines be-
neath my feet with our stem deep in
her vitals the hazel slowly died on the
sea

  i think that there was little time be-
tween the instant of our impact and the
wild leap of tantor martin to the upper
deck of the hazel where he found
the girl i dont know but he reap-
peared amidst our gesticulating crowd
and she was in his arms he regained
the bridge and i heard the harsh clang
of the gongs signaling full speed
astern the tam oshanter slowly
backed out and the other steamer
lurched drunkenly as the water poured
into her hold

  youre drowning people i bawled
up through the trap hatch

  and the only answer i heard was the
obbing of a woman -

  so we left the hazel sinking into the
clear pure sea into the dark depths of
the pacific while her crew fought at
the boats and leaped downward like

nuts falling from a tree we left her
swiftly without looking backward
and on the bridge tantor martin stood
with his grim cruel eyes fixed on the
figure of captain burton who was on
the starboard side of the after deck
yelling for the single boat that had got
away to come back for him the girl
clung to the railing blind with tears

  of course i got a man at the wheel
and watched the whole affair but i
confess that i said nothing i picked
up what men of the hazels crew i
could and then i allowed the tam
oshanter to speed on her course

  burton went down with his ship a
yelling maniac a coward in death as he
had been in life as the hazel plunged
downward at the last i saw the smoke
of five revolver shots he was firing
wildly into the men on a life raft so
he died

  we reached san pedro and tantor
martin got the lines ashore and came
down to me who was again in the
wheelhouse

  im responsible he said to me
youd best say that you were kid-
naped

  the girl i said

  the girl i hope for no other
warmth in this world than the warmth
of her breath no other sweetness but
that of her lips no sky but that of her
eyes no shelter but that of her arms

  queer speech-wasnt it-from the
pirate hed killed men and wrecked a
ship for the sake of a girl you know
he was a brute but he took her to him-
self they were married the morning
we got in

  i wish i could see her again

  she was very lovely and adorable

the terror

by charles edward russell


chapter i

i suppose i might say it began
with the marlinespike my part i
mean when events reached out and
caught a perfectly harmless supercargo
by the slack of his thirty-four jacket
and crammed him into the works

  i was that supercargo by title and
sufferance just about as important as
the office and that was not at all a
curious little chap rather crablike
without much interest outside a few
books and plenty of quiet and a vague
tradition of sickiiness spectacled in-
clined to the ingrowing grouch so easily
mistaken for melancholy

  my folks had sent me to sea for my
health eighteen months of browsing
around the palm islands and the china
ports on captain kendricks little
tramp trader hadnt bothered it much
meanwhile i had acquired profanity in
six native dialects and a kind of beach-
combing pose of world-weariness and
indifference

  i never was very good at that last
you need years to get the right flavor
years of gin pickling where the sun
swings among the coconuts and the
trade winds say grace for you while
you lie along and wait for the morning
roll to drop off the breadfruit tree

  that sort of thing appealed or i
thought it did nothing had ever hap-
pened to me i didnt want anything
to happen rot of course altogether

if 

v 

a gloomy and rather morbid young ass
with perhaps just a touch of liver and
altogether the unlikeliest man in the
world for the grim vivid business of
the colleen baum

  events are always turning these
queer tricks you know or fate if
you like or chance always grab-
bing some tag end of a creature out
of his feather bed and slinging him
into the turmoil of things just to see
what he looks like when he comes
through i suppose-if he ever does
cotne through

  up to the particular moment of which
i write i had taken no part griev-
ances of course i had i was very
hopelessly in love for one thing and
thats the worst of grievances i re-
sented the cruise because i didnt un-
derstand it i disliked the crew because
they were strange to me and a bad lot
i hated the shouting seas and drumming
gales of the great cold south because
i was softened to putty by tropic heats

  but the net result of all these mat-
ters had been only to drive me further
into sulky retirement and i should
never have known or cared any more
of them probably-if the marlinespike
hadnt missed

  you see i have reason to be grateful
to that marlinespike for missing of
course incidentally for shocking me
out of my doze so to speak and send-
ing me along into the mill with my eyes
open

  it came as i was crawling down into
the warmer depths of the vessel seek-
ing comfort in the cuddy hole i was
just beside the coaming of the after
hatch on the lower deck when it
whipped out of the darkness some-
where whanged into the wooden
sheathing of the bulkhead and stuck
quivering

  now for a chunk of cold iron to
make a flutter past a mans ear it has
to come pretty close there was a
chill upon me due to no outer tem-
perature as i sprang for the companion
with a yell popping through the scut-
tle i almost fell over the stowaway up
to his elbows in grease at the donkey
engine

 hey i bawled did you do
that

  silly enough question but i was
rather flustered the mans ferrety
face turned up at me under one arm

  what mister

  nobody had had a guess at his na-
tionality since machan had dragged him
from the coal bunkers five days out
of sydney too late to ship him back
matthew he called himself a good
enough name as wrathful captain ken-
drick assured him to hang by he had
paid for his temerity name and all
in driven slavish labor but i couldnt
imagine what under the sun he might
have against me i had never had three
words of him

  did you heave that spike did you
let me see your hands

  he held them out full of dirty cot-
ton waste and garmed with oil it
seemed scarce possible and yet-

  he observed me quietly never a
start of surprise at my sudden charge
too curiously calm for innocence i
thought but still not under pressure
not withheld impersonal rather
that was it

  see anybody about just now

   seen nobody mister

  ducking down this scuttle may-
be-

  only you mister

  his detachment was perfect i could
find no strain of guilt in him i could
find nothing to trust either

  you been here all the time
  right here mister

 and you didnt- oh hell-

  i gave him up and flung away down
the companion again what was the
use another unexplained and appar-
ently inexplicable hap on a voyage that
had been one dim string of perplexities
from the start i didnt know what it
meant for the instant i didnt care
i swaggered openly past the hatch in
reckless invitation

in the passage i met bane the mate
and how is your good health stand-
ing this climate mr keating he
asked suavely snappy weather
snappy

  shaken as i was i would have sworn
the question was a jeer i glowered
at his smooth full-blooded face with
the strange eyes green as jade and
played upon like the polished stone with
twinkling lights there was a coolness
between the mate and me sullen on
my side nursed for a dozen reasons
that seemed sufficient but chiefly for
this way of his that i could never tell
when he was making me a mock

  he smiled in amiable concern
pretty poorly thanks i growled
oh youll come on he nodded
youll make a good finish in the ant-
arctic yet or thereabouts

he said it heartily a singular phrase
well have you spry as ever soon-
and keeping miss kendrick company
on deck all day i shouldnt wonder
she must miss you

  now the man knew very well she did
nothing of the sort he knew ellen
kendrick kept nobodys company past
mere politeness he had tried it him-
self and rather more and been sent to
the rightabout for his pains
the terror



  so he was only fleering at me after
all but i shrugged it aside there
was a new and pressing need on me
due to the marlinespike

  mr bane i said abruptly where
in gods name are we headed for
whats this weve come to do tell
me that

  he pulled a lip and cast down his lids
with a manner he had

  you know now keating-im only
the mate thats not my business
strictly not captain kendrick is a
great disciplinarian you must have

noticed-

  and so mocked me again with such
a word of our little bounceball of a
skipper and the overwrought petulance
he had come to these days

  sealed orders my son smiled
bane bracing easily against the swing
of the vessel were under sealed or-
ders so to say but you might ask
him

  i cursed the man in my heart

  im asking you i cried it all
began with you-when poor applebone
disappeared in yokohama and you took
his billet whats it about whats it
damn well for

  he shook his head

  dont take it so hard mr keating
he soothed health you know very
bad for the health what do you want
to know for

  as if some one had whispered be-
hind me i became suddenly mindful
that he and i were alone in that dark
passage call it what you like nerves
premonition the start of the marline-
spike or the curious green smile of
him we were very much alone

  i moved away

  it worries me i mumbled i

thought- but it doesnt matter do

ships often put to sea without a port
ahead mr bane

  oh that isnt so he answered
quickly youll find it in our papers

cleared for colombo and coromandel
coast-all serene

  thats the reason naturally why
were headed for the antarctic

  he shrugged

  a side jaunt say a little side jaunt
-for a change of air most ordinary
thing a skipper changing his course
a tramp you know is governed only
by her masters whim oh to be seri-
ous of course hes going to pick up
a cargo somewhere trust him dont
you trust him

  i-i really never thought of that

but now you mention it-

  i was getting on my way as speedily
as might be without seeming to run
from him already i was appalled at
my outburst

  youll like it keating make you
develop man youll thrive on it
make you forget all these foolish no-
tions

  all right i murmured ive no
doubt its all right im-im not quite
well you know

  he did not stir after me but stayed
wagging his head smiling down the
passage

  well look after that my boy he
called youll see youre sure to
like it where youre going be easy
and with that friendly assurance
ringing after me i got away friendly
indeed almost paternal but i found
myself tensed and unnerved as at a
most ominous and fateful warning i
was only grateful i had not broken
out about the marlinespike

  all right i called back all right
-and-thanks

  simply craven that was and my
hand shook so when i took out my
spectacles that they fell and smashed

chapter ii

  down in the cuddy i hugged my
trouble to myself miserably i should
not go to captain kendrick i had al-


new story magazine

ready decided that a sullen kind of
pride held me suspicion as well born
of the many slights he had put upon
me his exaggerated secretiveness of
late and banes ascendency over him

  he knew the answer to all the sin-
ister transformations that had been
wrought aboard his craft he was re-
sponsible he might even have ordered
the throwing of that spike in the evil
change that had come upon him these
last weeks i believed him capable of
anything

  i yearned upon the past the sleepy
idle months of tramping among the
islands where life was soft as a lullaby
of the coral reefs where folk were
simple and mild and daily interests
scarce drew the languid trader from his
shaded hammock i could have gone
on so forever

  what madness had suddenly driven
us from such pleasant paths to these
far limits wrenched us from our
peaceful ways banished our gentle
kanakas overrun us with a crew of
scowling fierce-eyed strangers what
curse was on us that we should have
to lie and juggle and skulk-and dodge
murderous marlinespikes

  bill machan nodded when he saw
me there huddled in a corner against
the vessels swooping plunges knees
braced to the table

  how dye like it now not such
cheer as maybe ye thought this ram-
damnin around after the south pole
what

  mac himself stood stark in his tat-
tered old pajamas unless the grease
from his beloved engines might count
an extra covering he took a lurch-
ing line for his private locker three
fingers he measured himself carefully
one of bitters and two of gin and
looked at me furtively as he drank

  can ye see me in fur rugs thats
for the rest of ye for mysel im
chief kettle tinker of a hot-water trader
and too old to change kendrick can

put skates on her and go explore the
frozen hell if he likes-its his ship
but me-bill machanll stand by the
main steam where he can sweat as he
likes-send were not split on an ice-
berg

  and now observe me beginning to
play politic cunning even

  its perishing cold i agreed

  itll be colder man dye know
were droppin latitude off our stern
with the log line fifty south if were
one degree and naught ahead but the
victoria quadrant and the bottom of
the earth

   dragged up a grin

  not so bad as that mac ken-
dricks no fool hell find a cargo
hereabouts soon-trust him

  snowballs he queried settling his
oil-soaked cap at a wise angle and low-
ering his voice or icicles to be
sure theres the blind cold sea snakes
aye-and other things a bodyd not
care to meet maybe

  he blinked at me across the tiny
space his loose bulk swaying easily to
meet the tilt of the deck it was four-
drink time or he would never have
said so much just now those last three
fingers were plucking at his tongue
my chance i thought with quickened
pulse he knew something

  but he must be on some sea track
i ventured others have surely traded
this way

  aye he nodded there was bilboe
ive heard

  i stared at him absolutely uncom-
prehending

  bilboe you mean the old black-
birder

  if that was all aye him the
thievin old devil that went twenty time
unhung back in the bad days seal
pirate pearl snatcher-slaver-worse
belike with his bloody port boy
gang

  i was groping wide for any clew in
this groping-
the terror



  why bilboe dropped out of sight
years ago if there ever was such a
man though some say the port boys
have kept a kind of vagabond frater-
nity- bilboe what do you mean

by that mac its a fable

  he lurched away to lock up his glass
a fable well-perhaps they
say he went into hell by way of the
cellar door were in the basement our-
sels whai-s this im making some
drunken argle-bargle of the beaches
god help us all toa better understand-
ing

he had tried to tell me something
but i was no good at these blind leads
mac i said be plain with me
plain the plainest man afloat mr
keating just daffin sir just plain
bill daffin at his bit drink

  im in the dark i pleaded

  so am i so are we all its every-
body for himself thats the sad fac
in this world mr keating

  he shuffled for the door and glanced
at me sidelong

  give me a word machan weve
come to strange doings do you know
where were headed for one thing
not i he cried sharply

  he peered into the passage and
looked back

  strange doings he muttered
aye a sober god-fearin little tramp
sent reelin madwise across the empty
polar sea a canny tradin captain
turned explorer a brand-new mate
come from heaven knows a double
allowance of hands-what for pas-
sengers belike not to speak of a
stowaway and a woman-theres a

ships company besides-

  he spoke as of the supernatural
hushed and solemn

  its a fac mr keating ive not
had a slicing bar alongside the head
of one man since we left sydney
heard ye ever the like

  wait machan i cried youve

said too much whats a fellow to do
speak out

  how should i know  except go
wary aye a lad could do that keep
shy of dark corners and his glims
peeled

  would it surprise you to learn
theres been murder tried on board al-
ready 

  sirs sirs his hand went up
trembling its not so stevens was
not murdered never say it

  stevens

  i remembered then that was the
name of a man we had lost overboard
in a heavy blow two days before a
stoker who had come up for a breath
of air and been swept off by a great
sea so the story went i looked at him
and my lips were hard bitten he had
told me more far more than he
thought

  the man was careless he said

  as i was-very nearly i added
unsteadily

  he shot me a glance from the edge
of the doorway which i may have mis-
read but which to me meant pity

  and whats to be your own part
mac i demanded

  me why below of course he
answered hastily tinker bill dye
mind everybodys friend that makes
the engines go engines have to go
whatever theres one or two good
boys have been with me many a year
well stick by the engines where we
belong for mysel-im a man that
has a family

  he jammed his cap lower

  ive said nothing mr keating re-
member that he whispered not a
word sir mum

  so he left me wedging up and down
there in the cuddy corner with the
creak of labored beams for company
to take what comfort i could from
their manifold confidences

  i had his answer nothing could
have been plainer for the sake of


new story magazine

twelve a month and the job he meant
to play safe come what might he
and his little personal group below
decks we were close upon the time
evidently when every man aboard the
colleen bawn must set himself right
or at least neutral with the secret pur-
pose now driving her

  i knew nothing of that purpose could
guess nothing outwardly the daily
life of a tramp trader held its wonted
course with us the new crew went
quietly about their duties orders were
obeyed-even the stokehold was being
run without a fisted slicing bar

  but i was awake now i perceived
that the very smoothness of routine
heightened the tension under it all
tension that comes between hidden in-
tent on one side and unanswered ques-
tioning on the other tension that rises
from contradictory shifts and changes
with no reasons assigned

  the colleen bazvn had become a
floating mystery and the little super-
cargo was to be counted out

chapter iii

  came to me then the larrikin i
raised my head from my arms at the
table where i sat brooding and as i
looked up he was there but i had
not heard him come and anything
more disconcerting than the sudden
sight of him so was not in my experi-
ence

  tyke my word he said with a
tinkling giggle like a cracked nickel bell
tyke my word i thought you was
asleep

  it was as if a cold breath had fanned
the back of my neck and up into my
hair i gazed at him much as a sheep
at the rings might gaze

  no thief caught with his fingers in
the till ever looked such a picture of
detected guilt he stood resting awk-
wardly at the table edge a spasm of
sly embarrassment on his hatchet face

his brows working his glance fugitive
and bent toward me bent toward me
with one hand hidden in his jacket
pocket

 what do you want i managed
to ask

  why  wag just hoping youd wyke
up sir he whined thinks i if hes
asleep i wont rouse him not the likes
of me i know my plyce sir i was
just going awy when here you duck
up and find me funny thing int it

  he giggled again with an assumption
of ease and drew his hand almost os-
tentatiously from the pocket empty
and presently i felt better i was no
strongarm goodness knows but face
on i was a match for this chap at
least

  perrin he called himself a straw-
limbed sunken-chested creature a
typical sydney water rat of the kind
that has given the domain such un-
savory fame as its habitat as long as
my back was to the wall i need not
fear him greatly the less since the
surprise had set him apparently all
abroad

  youve no business in this part of
the ship i challenged

  no sir not at all sir i was only
looking for you-tyke my word-

  what for 

  his pale eyes jumped here and yon
he had no yarn ready was scarce equal
to one i pressed him

  come what is it spit it out
something to tell me

  thats it sir he cried and grabbed
the cue-almost gratefully i could
have sworn now you tyke me
something to tell you-and a clever
young gent you are sir

  he leered and waggled his simian
brows

  thinks i heres this mr keating
thinks i thats the gent for you go
and tell him perrin what you got on
your mind and here i am sir

  behind his vast assumption of craft
the terror



i could see him struggling for some
lie that might pass muster it was
the measure of his mind that he thought
me quite deceived if he could find the
excuse

  this is confident sir strict confi-
dent youll remember i know you
mr keating i know a gentleman sir
when i tell him something he dont go
to give it awy to nobody not him
sir

  altogether such an admixture of shal-
low fraud and native loathsomeness as
filled me with contempt an actor him-
self capable of any crime i thought
who undertook with transparent and
superfluous cunning to play the stage
conspirator for my benefit

  go on i said curtly

  he shifted an elaborate glance
around and cupped a hand hesitating

  why sir youre a young gent as
notices quick id sy looka here sir
did you ever happen like to see a-
a black wallet kicking about anywheres
on board oilskin it would be a
goodish size-big as your two palms
together

  i could have laughed in his face to
see the eagerness he threw into this
absurdity i wondered how far he
would go

  a black wallet i repeated

  ah thats it he cried with bated
breath black oilskin now ill tyke
my word youve seen it somewheres
keeping of the ships pypers and all
the wy you do

  and what about this wallet i
asked

  he launched then into a rambling
tale of how this precious wallet had
been stolen in sydney and a reward
offered for its return how one of the
hands an old lag had brought it
aboard with him how it was since
missing and had possibly been shoved
awy somewheres by a cove as didnt
knows its value

  now sir he wheedled it might

be worth a good bit to you that wallet
likely youve seen it maybe in the
captains berth just you tell me where
you saw it sir and youll get your
share-tyke my word 

  i had the utmost scorn of him now
a luxury that was close to costing me
dear such was my inaptitude at this
kind of thing i had not noticed his
edging nearer and ever nearer through-
out his discourse

  i never saw any wallet i said snap-
pil-y whats more i dont believe
there is one do you think me any

such fool-

  i turned from him with a gesture
of impatience

  in the flash he was half over the
table again his hand whipping to his
pocket his colorless eyes drawn to
points

  keep off i yelled scrambling
back i had the sense or the inspira-
tion to grab for my own hip

  he shrank as swiftly cringing

  my word youre hasty sir he
whined no offense i was only tell-
ing you- but if you sy you never

saw it-

  you get away from me i cried of
a tremble you get out of here im

ready for you  by god-

   actually took a step toward him and
he slid away like the rat he was

  yes sir quite right sir thank

you sir-

  he slipped into the passage still
whining and was gone like a demon
through a trap and i-i fell upon
the bench again in a jangle of nerves
and helpless wrath

  that he should so nearly have over-
reached me after all almost he had
made good the bungling of the marline-
spike i could not doubt that that was
his errand the same will that had
urged the first attempt had sent him
to knife me quietly here in the cuddy
the slimy assassin with his mounte-


new story magazine

hank tricks that i had thought so ob-
vious

 what was to be done about it-
under heaven what could i do no
friend nb single soul to turn to i
thought of kendrick again despairingly
i could not believe in soberness that
he was for having me murdered yet
he was involved somehow with these
men he was part of the mystery i
its victim

  it was a settled thing twice i had
survived but the next attack-or the
next  was to vanish as stevens
had vanished-in some moment of fatal
carelessness how long could i post-
pone that moment how fight a ship-
ful of prowling dangers

  and why  why should any one wish
me dead the supercargo i could
think of none i might have offended
save possibly bane and would even
bane go to such lengths for such a
cause-and in such a way  no it went
deeper far deeper

  you see me there huddled in the
cuddy and the case to which i had
come bewildered angerecu in a fu-
tile way untrained to action un-
equipped save for a certain doggedness
torn from my customary supports and
struggling with the incomprehensible
a kind of dishoused snail

  i looked about me and found no hope
none i was in the dark baited
knowing not wherefore nor whence
nor by whom knowing nothing of the
whole dark game

  a foot padded softly outside in the
passage and i stood tense with the
breath caught in my throat at the
doorway slid to view a calm brown
face

  mass kenrick want to see you top
side him cabin mass hugh

  i drew a long sigh of relief only
maheyo here i might believe was
no enemy he was the sole remaining
member of the colleens original kan-
aka crew a faithful fellow and a

right sailor a loyalty islander born
long a wanderer among the pidgin
ports kendrick had kept him on as
carpenter and handy man it was no
unusual thing for him to carry mes-
sages and i feared no treachery in
this knives and marlinespikes were
not m alleyos style

  captain wants me

  he nodded and i followed him out
and along the passage without ques-
tion we met no one the way was
clear as we climbed to the thwartship
corridor under the house that was
what decided him perhaps at the
very top of the companionway he
peered over swung back and gripped
me by the arm

  you  say spose i tell you some-
thing mass hugh

  i looked at him with the crinkle of
nerve i had learned of late never
had i heard the big native use that
tone he was a warrior fearless come
of fighting stock

  youre in this too maheyo i
breathed dismayed

  no he shot back low-voiced
maheyo no can do-that bobbeley
you hear

  i wondered what mischief it was he
could not do some bidding of those
who hunted me doubtless

  yes

  you member that time maheyo sick
for die-goddam sick you member
that time you give maheyo one piecee
medcine 

  i remembered a touch of fever
when we were down off dutch papua
months before i had looked after him
somewhat he had never spoken of it
since and indeed it was a small thing
but a big thing now for me by all
seeming

  well

  he drew me nearer

  mass hugh lie whispered you
know them port boy-them feller

  i stared with startled memory leap-
the terror



ing to seize the word the port boys
everybody who ever drank with island
outcasts had heard of them from fiji
to the aleuts the beaches knew some
rumor of them a kind of secret order
organized by deserters in papette years
ago to control the recruiting of crews
which later ran like a pestilence through
the pearling and sealing fleets at least
three mutinies several murders a dozen
stolen cargoes were laid at their charge
before the skippers who would not join
their ranks finally crushed them out
but the whole thing was a sort of
robin hood tale now some denied
their very existence and bilboe the

flower of their flock-

  strange to hear that echo again
well i said stupidly port boys
thats an old story maheyo been
dead these many years

  he caught my hand

  mass hugh spose them muchee
bad port boy come live-spose some
feller talkey you port boy-you
shakeum all same so fashion

  his fingers slipped around mine clos-
ing them in a curious manner and i
winced at a sudden pressure of doubled
knuckle on my palm and then his
meaning flashed upon me he was giv-
ing me a secret grip driving it into my
hand so that i should not forget
maheyo i cried whats this

mean-

  but he shook his head and pulled
me up to the top step then steered me
for the starboard door

  you go that way he said he re-
leased me swiftly and bounded down
the companion

   member he called back

  wait i begged maheyo tell
me more whats the damned thing

about where are we going-

  but he was gone no reply came
up to me but the hollow ring of my
own voice

  walking unsteadily in a kind of daze
i left the house by the side to which

he had sent me i had to throw all
my weight to the door before i could
force it open against the wind and
struggle out to the sloping deck

chapter iv

  the colleen baiun was squattering
and plunging in a steel-blue bowl chill
and bare not a cloud above not a
sail below only the torn steam plume
of our escape and the sheeting sprays
driven white to the funnel across that
glaring emptiness above a hard sun
like a yellow pebble that gave no
warmth in the long afternoon of polar
summer a devils searching blast be-
hind the ground swell that ran out of
the south

  for a week we had been batter-
ing through continuous storm this
was comparative calm though savage
enough to me

  clinging to the rungs i fought nay
way up the starboard ladder i sick-
ened tp see the foam-ridged hollows
down which we swooped to watch the
whole foreshortened bulk climb up as
if to trip upon the bowsprit and fall
away again in a shuddering rush the
wind stabbed me with icy lances
mocked me shrieked madness in my
ear

  i did not know this sea it was
fierce and vast and lonely i hated it
and feared it foi a panic moment i
hung upon the ladder cowering like
a child i felt my weakness i felt
i could only yield abjectly to the dan-
gers of this wild cruise my will to
face the welter slacked away from me
like loosened strands until-

  until looking aloft i caught a
glimpse of a vivid little figure braced
against the canvas dodger of the upper
bridge blue clad with a bright
laughing face keen against the wind
and back-blown hair that threaded
golden under the tilt of her tam

  she saw me nodded and called some

careless greeting that was lost on the
gale

 ellen kendrick-

  the blood went leaping through my
veins tingling as at the urge of some
subtle wine merely to see her so
here at last was strength even for
a shivering rag of a supercargo i
drew it from her she was vital she
was the love of life she was life itself
worth all sacrifice all effort only to
hope to serve her without favor was
reason enough-

  for she was with me in this sinister
mystery forgotten no i hadnt for-
gotten it but the thing struck new
upon my new knowledge my new ap-
prehension she was here surrounded
by these strangers walking among
these secret perils blithe and carefree
and unknowing while the vessel swept
on upon its fateful covert mission

  her fathers ship-yes but murder
stalked the decks unchecked helpless
folk were being hunted for their lives
evil shadows lurked about shadows of
crime of lawless men of unguessed
lawless possibilities the very motive
that guided our rudder was shrouded
in dark suggestion what was to be-
come of her with such powers afoot
who was to watch for her protect her

  i might do something feeble and
harried though i was the time might
come when she could use me a fanci-
ful hope perhaps but it gave me one
solid grip it gave me courage to go
on-and oh i needed just that

  heartened keyed to action i sprang
up on the bridge and started aft for
the captains cabin midway i stopped
with a curious notion on me i turned
back to the chart-room doorand tried
it it was locked

  the chart room aboard the colleen
was the whole narrow section through
the forward end of the bridge house
passing around the bridge and noting
that the room was not occupied i came

to the larboard door it was open set
on the brass tongue

  i stepped to the rail lest some one
be spying

  aft of the bridge deck on top of
the house a little knot of sailors was
busied about some task at one of
the two great surfboats i thought
which were bedded down on either side
of the funnel but presently i saw
that they were all grouped along a
stout and heavy spar such as is used
for fending the boats off

  perrin was there a bearded ruffian
known as farralone jim another chap
with a dirty blue canvas turban bound
around his head and my late acquaint-
ance matfhew their care it was to
keep the spar neatly balanced near the
edge while they crouched peering
below

  it jumped to my mind suddenly that
they were posted just over the port end
of the thwartship passage the way by
which i should have blundered out all
unsuspecting if maheyo had not sent
me to starboard any one coming out
there must stand below them they
were watching-with the spar ready-
waiting-

  i knew then how a cornered animal
feels when the foes have driven him
the last inch have all but reached him
this was the third time i could have
snarled spite of the sagging at my
knees i crept back to the chart-room
door unperceived none of them had
looked up

  i slipped the fastening and darted
through tiptoed across to the wide cab-
inet where the charts were kept the
third shallow drawer showed an edge
beyond the others i tried it first a
plotted chart of the indian ocean was
the topmost-the regulation chart laid
out in checkered blue with currents and
soundings curled and dotted in mazy
designs our course was marked across
it in lead pencil shooting down from
sydney with a pin prick at every noon
the terror



observation but the line ran off the
bottom of the sheet at forty-five degrees
south

  i think i had my first clear notion
in that moment of how far to what
strange limits we had come we were
beyond the pale outside all regions
of ordinary human experience down
among the waste ends of the earth

  i tried another drawer and another
the second gave up the prize my su-
preme discovery no navigating chart
but a simple geographical map appar-
ently torn from some book showing
the great southern sea and its adja-
cent lands without depths or move-
ments or any of the information a care-
ful sailor requires merely a makeshift
on which captain kendrick had con-
tinued to plot our progress

  my finger followed the line again
the last recorded position deep in the
blue and dated that day february 
was ninety-six degrees thirteen minutes
east and fifty-two degrees twenty-
eight minutes south

  eagerly i cast forward along the in-
dicated direction seeking a destination
seeking one ray of light amid all the
crowding enigmas we had traveled
from sydney to the south by west we
were still traveling where to what
point

  the answer caught me like a fist be-
tween the eyes for of all the amazing
details that had clustered so far about
the cruise of the colleen bazvn certainly
this was the most startling the most
improbable the whole lower map was
empty the whole stretch was as blank
as the back of my hand not a dot
not a reef or a shoal between cape
leeuwin and the vague mass of the
polar continent itself-nothing

   a dizziness took me i was a man
tottering on a fearful brink where sight
and sound and sense were lost beyond
-beyond-

  i closed the drawer and leaned
against the cabinet dumfounded in

that black instant i felt my clenched
fingers stung by cold metal i glanced
up scarce consciously and caught a
point of glitter on the top of the cab-
inet reaching i plucked from con-
cealment there-a revolver

  i snatched it to me as the starving
snatch a crust or the drowning a straw
a weapon this no ordinary seagoing
pepperpot but a gun forty-four with
magazine fully charged a gun to put
heart and backbone in a man only to
feel its heft a gun to trust

  furtively but without hesitation or
scruple i accepted this single boon of
fate when i left the chart room an
instant later i carried that bulldog in
my right fist and my fist inside my
pocket

chapter v

  i invite no mans judgment on the
acts and emotions to which my plight
henceforward carried me let him who
has never been snatched from out the
safe and pleasant gardens of life and
hurled into its bramble pit hold off his
frown from me he cant know the
bitterness the savagery the horror that
dissolve the settled constituents of a
nature and precipitate them anew in
strange and unsuspected forms he
cant know the possibilities suspended
in himself and what they might show-
under the terrific chemistry of events
well for him perhaps if he could

  you see me as i came to the cap-
tains cabin never was framed i sup-
pose a less belligerent creature one
with fewer martial attributes i never
had struck a blow in hot blood i never
had gone armed in my life nor con-
sidered even idly the injury or death
of any human being

  and yet here was i ready for a fight-
ing show-down gripping a gun in my
pocket like any desperado resolved
even fiercely intent on killing the next
man who should lift a hand against me

  two ideas possessed me wholly to

know the meaning of our nightmare
of a voyage and to know whether ken-
drick and bane were truly concerned
in some general conspiracy of which
the attacks on me had been but inci-
dents

   i still had hopes of them one or
 both i might still possibly look for
 aid and protection spite of all seem-
 ing the thing might prove no worse
 than a grudge the vicious malice of
 some obscure seaman the third at-
 tempt had convinced me at last that i
 must know definitely how the com-
 manders stood

   captain kendrick bounced about in
 his chair at the little shelf table and
 glared at me his puffy hands had
 knotted with a start amid a litter of
 papeis

   hey fore god whatre you do-
 ing here when i want to see that
 slab-sided figgerhead of yours ill send
 word

   three hours before i should have
 yelped promptly now i waited alert
 knowing quite well he could never quit
 with one phrase

   dont remind me youre a kind of
 a horse marine on my ship he bawled
 i wont have it no privileges not
 a damn one aint your private saloon
 is it-this cabin  ill have no one nos-
 ing around clear

   he flung back to his desk grumbling

   still i waited

   the changes of weeks were measured
 by that greeting during our long
 tramps among the islands i had indeed
  made free of his cabin as my own but
 what held me what had sunk upon me
 deeper at each encounter with him of
 late was the shocking change in him-
 self

   from a rosy little pudding of a chap
 rather futile and weak and heavy-
 witted but stuffed with good cheer-
 from this he had fallen to a sickly
 flabbiness like a wrinkled balloon petu-

 lant and suspicious with gray pouches
 for cheeks

  it was a recent habit with him to
slip into curious abstractions so he
did as i watched him fumbling with
the papers his outbreak forgotten

  damn it all keating he protested
feebly we got no time for weak sis-
ters cant favor nobody its a job
for men bane said that white men
-tough swabs i ought to left you at
sydney like he warned me and the
girl too if id a pinch of sense only
she would come couldnt tell her why
not could i-

  his voice fumed away and sparked
again like a running fuse

  not the first time i had heard him
maunder so you may imagine but the
first time i had caught the pathetic sig-
nificance

  the pity of it knocked on me i
gave up my half-formed plan of beard-
ing him outright i had blamed him
he had been irritable secret-criminal
perhaps even now i could not doubt
some folly of his had prompted the mad
voyage which had brought us all to this
pass but i saw the wreck that folly
had wrought he could not live long
to suffer its results dupe or guilty
agent the business was nearly over for
him he had death in his face

  i looked around the comfortable
cabin the place i had known so well
the books the lounging bunk the rice-
paper paintings a grinning papuan
totem a native dancing wig a pickwick
lithograph looted from some trading
station a blue print of ellen-whefein
i had studied her sweet face many a
drowsy evening and so came to love it
before ever i saw her-mother of his
sisters cottage out manly way where
the motherless girl had lived before this
evil cruise the yellowed clippings from
punch the padlocked rack for his three
repeating rifles-treasured relics of
seal-hunting days all the homely and
the terror



familiar trifles of his nautical house-
keeping

  i recalled the many hours we had be-
guiled here together-over one of the
queer mixtures he delighted to evolve
from a well-stocked liquor cabinet to
his spinning it might be with a fat
chuckle of endless dull tales of cargo
windfalls and high freights along the
yellow coasts

  and now to see him as he was

  he sat babbling while the whole com-
pany of us swung on toward some dim
and monstrous catastrophe-babbling
plucking at scraps of paper impotent
and obsessed with what siren fancy
luring him on with what wild hope
desire lust crawling like maggots in
his troubled brain her father

  captain kendrick i said impul-
sively tell me only tell me what the

wretched thing is let me help-

 he jumped like a bladder on a
string

  where it is he almost screamed
turning on me ill see you damned

tell you where-i-

  he checked stared at me seeming to
recognize me anew but when he went
on his face was distorted with anger
and suspicion

  now fore god is it you still hang-
ing about  are you here to spy on me 
are you 

  one more mystification it seemed i
never was to get a hold on anything
tangible and sane again

  im asking you to let me in-

  but that was worse

  let you in he stuttered let you
in well damn your greedy soul
hey why should i isnt it mine
is every tom and jake to grab a share
off me  the brass gall of you and

wanting to know where-

  captain i cried i mean no

harm-

  how did you hear of it at all he
demanded in another furious twist
is it common gab about the ship it

    

is fore god i feared so every-
body knows-and theres an end of
it-

  he broke off to knot and wring his
hands with a revulsion of anxiety as
bewildering to me as his rage

  i only want to be set right i
begged i dont know what youre
talking about ive done nothing
only to be near crazed-near mur-
dered captain youve got to tell me
-youve got to-if theres any hope
for me here is it by your orders im
to be killed tell me that

  he blinked at my distress

  no no he said craftily thats
all cute pidgin tricks to draw me
out theres nothing to tell killing
whats such talk not unless-fore
god unless some swab tries too much
on me

  i had to steady myself a little against
the cabin wall it was hard to deal
with this without breaking-hard i
had a fleeting vision of myself as a
small boy trying to tug a gutter drunk-
ard to his feet and getting a smash
between the eyes for my pains the
stupor of helplessness-of unfair-
ness-

  yet somehow i had no anger only
a sinking at the dead futility of it all
he was in some hideous void of his
own wrestling with phantoms striking
out blindly

  quiet be quiet captain do i look
like tricks you trip me on a word
all i want is to understand-cant you
tell me-

  it was  use in his obsession he
thought me only cajoling i could not
get past his barrier

  nothing to tell dont know where
the thing is havent got it i never
had it

  i made a final desperate plea

  kendrick what are we doing at
fifty-three south

  he blenched and the impact of that


new story magazine

simple question stiffened him in his
chair

  clear he said with difficulty mov-
ing a finger at the door clear
youll be sent for when wanted

  i held my ground

  i was sent for

  what

  ordered to the bridge

 hey who-

  maheyo

 said i wanted-

  yes

  that aint so he gagged star-
ing tha aint so

  well he added it must have
slipped my mind perhaps i did-any-
how-

  a slight mistake sir interrupted a
smooth voice from the doorway we
both whirled around at bane who had
come like a shadow

maheyo must have got the mes-
sage wrong it was i sent for mr
keating myself very sorry sorry
the skipper bounced again a fresh
suspicion had pricked him

 you sent for him here at my
quarters damn it sir i wont have
it aint a common meeting place is
it-this cabin suppose i dont know
its been searched twice already ran-
sacked fore god ill have no one
hanging about the place no one

  i was startled but the mate only
smiled with his superior green glance

  oh i didnt call him here sir i
wanted to meet mr keating-in the
chart house

  he turned the twinkle of his eye
on me

  so he knew what i had learned just
now or failed to learn in my visit
to the forward compartment i won-
dered if he knew what else i had found
there and what a difference it had
made to me and that i held it trained
on him through my pocket as he stood
if he did he gave no sign

  i fully intended to meet mr keat-

ing at the chart room he went on
in that suave manner but i missed
him there-through his coming up the
wrong way unfortunately missed
him

chapter vi

  i wonder if i can give any notion
of the immensity with which the man
loomed upon me in that moment my
last disappointment had left me un-
nerved he seemed to know every-
thing to be everything omnipotent
calm and sure and i a fool young-
ster stalking bugaboos with a popgun

  with his strange compelling eyes on
me i wavered he was strong so
much the strongest of us to think to
dicker or fence with him appeared
merely childish i had an impulse to
throw it all aside confess all my ter-
rors surrender the whole tangle to his
will and order an abject temptation
to placate him at any cost

  whats your business with keat-
ing demanded the captain with a
brooding frown at his second

  i wished particularly to offer mr
keating an exchange of berths was
the ready reply not well you know
hes not chipper at all a fact we all
regret im sure it occurred to me-
heres my own cabin right by your own
sir plenty of light and air why
shouldnt he have it bunking
is no hardship to me

  i might have been his cherished
chum the way he spoke he seemed
friendly plausible and hearty i
wanted to believe he meant to be
friendly

 youll give him your cabin
queried the skipper blinking

  oh at his convenience of course
said bane easily when we get better
weather no hurry ive no wish to
hurry him just a suggestion of mine
for his future comfort fact is ive
been worrying a good deal to-day about
mr keatings comfort
the terror



  i came back with a start why the
whole thing was false a cloud of
words to cover my unexpected arrival
at the bridge a bit of the diabolic
mockery he so affected

  my comfort

  he knew of the marlinespike of
perrins knife of the spar waiting ver
the passage like the fall of a trap he
knew and it suited his cynic humor
to put his wiles upon me to persuade
me almost-

  thanks i stammered breaking the
spell of his green gaze marveling at
my own weakness and at his power

  i had never fathomed bane since the
day his spare lithe figure and smiling
face topped our rail at yokohama
applebone our old mate had been
bludgeoned in some obscure waterside
brawl we couldnt seem to get the rights
of it was so bane came to us on the
heels of tragedy ill-omened an un-
likely figure for such a job more like
a society yachtsman than a common salt
jack with his neat rig and close-
cropped sun-bleached hair and mus-
tache but his papers were in shape
he impressed kendrick and he got the
ticket in an ill hour for us

  his personality had drawn and re-
pelled me in about equal degree at first
a man of forceful qualities magnetic
of an intellect yet with that curious
mocking reserve that could cut deeper
than any gibe-and a taint somehow
the taint that clings about certain
south sea outcasts as of something
buried-one ceases to be sensitive to it
after a while but s there some-
thing buried-and not quite deeply
enough-

  still i had failed to connect our new
officer with the skippers deplorable
transformation which began to over-
take him about that time until we
reached sydney until ellen joined
us then his sudden fancy and pur-
suit of the girl which went unrebuked
by her father revealed the influence he

had gained then i began to fear him
perhaps not fear so soon more what
the french mean by redouter that
he was redoubtable

  and now i saw him in another phase
master of chicane and trickery play-
ing with my torment playing with
kendricks suspicions the whole rot-
ten puzzle as a game between his pow-
erful corded hands

  the captain struck me in this instant
of perception as one plucked two ways
by banes compulsion and by his se-
cret grievance

  well there you are keating he
mumbled and be thankful of the
chance

his tongue ran on with him as usual
bring you clear of living near these
swine we got aboard that ought to
be a comfort to you damn the low-
flung lot of em

  bane stepped quickly inside the cabin
ah has mr keating been com-
plaining of the crew 

  i knew what he meant he thought
i had been blabbing it rejoiced me i
had done nothing of the kind and it
braced me further to see the skipper
still had a kick left in him

  no sir he flared i complain
theyre a damn ugly outfit more like
a gang of convicts than decent fool
sailormen i aint used to such that
farralone now that gallowsbird-i sent
him aloft this morning and fore god i
thought hed heave the slush bucket in
my face i did i lammed him good
twice ive had to knock a swab down
reaching for a knife call them sailors 

  that aint all i cant tumble out
but i fall over one of them sneaking
around spying on me i wont have
it i wont

  oh you must imagine that sir
soothed the mate they may be a bit
rough but theyre the best we could
get at sydney youll mind

  i mind you said so cried the skip-
per you got em cursed if i know


new story magazine

how must ha swept the dustbin
yours they are all but one or two i
signed at the dock head and keat-
ing here and a couple of machans
and a damned old fool i was to let you
ship em i see that now

  bane made a little gesture as he stood
looking down of a sudden something
seemed to whip kendricks raw nerves
he blinked and ducked away at his
table like a hermit crab scuttling his
defiance melted

  maybe ive lost the knack of white
hands he admitted querulously
damn if i dont find myself thinking
twice afore i boot em

  you supply the boots and ill guar-
antee the rest

  i-id done better to keep my kan-
akrs

  bane shrugged with smiling assur-
ance

  you agreed yourself that whites
were necessary for the climate-and the
work

  conceive if i was listening they
were verging toward the secret i
scarce breathed for eagerness awaiting
the next phrase on tenterhooks when
suddenly-

  the mate turned and saw me for
the first time in my knowledge of him
i got his frown and it was not pleas-
ant

  ah mr keating we neednt keep
you you wont find it comfortable to
change cabins to-day i should think
the glass is falling fast were close
to dirt remind me of it some other
time

  he waved me off turning to com-
plete the suppression of the captains
little revolt but this was where i sur-
prised him i understood well enough
he had never meant i should have his
cabin for that reason and because
i could have wished no better scheme
for getting nearer to ellen i meant to
have it

  thanks ill move i answered if

theres nasty weather ahead ill certain-
ly appreciate the better quarters ill
move right in-with thanks to you

  a refusal would have meant a break
right there an open avowal of bad
faith he didnt want it i saw that
but the glint in his eye damned me to
a future reward as he searched my face
in a pause

  do you know i find you improved
already keating my boy he purred
thats interesting you seem to be
coming on quite handily

  yes i said with my first thrill of
aggression yes ive been getting
treatment rather heroic ill take
that cabin

  his glance widened on me then

with a little fleering bow-

  oh invalids must be served he de-
cided call the steward to shift my
truck i hope your first night will be
comfortable

  a more evil-sounding wish never
rang in an unfortunates ear the bite
of it i stumbled out upon the bridge
deck there i stayed clutching the
rail hard while i called all my faculties
to the issue

  i had part of my answer both of
them were tangled in the affair past
any appeal of mine the crew was
banes his own picking that the cap-
tain now mistrusted them was no aid
it was too late he was at banes
mercy as we all were it began to
appear as we all were bane the ace
and all the trumps with the super-
cargo a lone card against the pack

  ellen to go to her to bring her
safe she was wandering about in
this nest of villainy alone at her whim
anything might happen these fiends
were everywhere banes men and
she had kept him at arms length until
now only by evasion by subtle parry
and check of his advances i had seen

much-

  how soon might he tire how soon
might the whole impending suspense
the terror



crash upon us i could not endure to
think of her so far away her place
was near her father some little pro-
tection at least the best she had her
one defense from these wolves-

  i swarmed the ladder to the upper
bridge her name on my lips she was
not there i missed the flash of her
tam along the length of the ship a
black-avised fellow known as dingo
was holding the wheel he scowled at
my query and shook his head i caught
the revolver again in my pocket and
scoured down to the decks like a man
possessed

chapter vii

   found her at last after a breath-
less search if any marked me as i
tore aft i do not know but none tried
to stop me i came up upon the poop
and there she was pacing a strip by the
taffrail as far from the bridge as she
well could get

  it need have been no great task i
suppose to warn her to put her on
her guard and that not too rudely no
such task but for me-

  i can only plead the urgence my
state of mind and the burden of in-
adequacy under which i still labored
as i saw it i must see her to the bridge
and get her instantly under cover i
must it came to that absolute point
and i went after it with about the
finesse youd use to drive a tenpenny
nail

  she paused at seeing me and i stood
mumchance still without the word and
so until i blundered into speech by
sheer desperation

  miss kendrick i blurted do you
think it safe to be so far from the bridge
house 

  she leaned on the taffrail balanced
easily to the dizzy swing and plunge
of the stern hair round swept and
wish lashed above her level brows and
with eyes straight as a mans

  however i may have showed in this
affair make no mistake about her a
trim competent dainty little figure in
her sailor jacket and navy cloth suit
no doll no finicking creature of
quirks and moods and drooping
glances sanity and vigor in her fresh
skin soft colored like a heart petal
her full-rounded youth her gray glance
clear and deep as the shadow in a
wood spring

  safe she repeated why you
wouldnt call this more than stunsl
weather would you you ought to get
out more into the spray and whistle of
it mr keating its glorious

  a huge wave shouldered up and up
beneath us till the screw raced she
laughed

  that makes her angry now shell
just wiggle her ears and jump for the
next one

  i did my feeble best

  i meant safe-aboard you-youre
out of call so far aft and sight too
the hint of a line drew between her
brows as she looked at me

  what of that mr keating

 you shouldnt be you-you
musnt be i mean-isnt the bridge
a better place

  not when i want to come here

  in-in the teeth of the wind you
like that and-youre out of the
grime and confusion up there isnt
that so

  why it may be-

  you see i cried of course it is
now if youll only walk forward with
me-

  she couldnt have been very much
impressed

  i think i prefer to stay here she
said quite naturally

  you cant theres danger youre
the length of the deck away from help
her gaze quickened on me

  help against what

  i spun around a sailor was at work
by the starboard quarterboat not far


new story magazine

away i thought i detected a stealthy
watchfulness upon our meeting

  against-anything an accident
perhaps pardon me im clumsy but
you can think what you like if youll
only come forward-now

 danger-

  she didnt approve of me a dis-
ordered oddity with roving eye and
chalk-smitten cheek who broke upon
her with such a word and still she
hesitated as if it vibrated with some
unacknowledged tension of her own
she looked off over the froth-tangled
seas

theres a tiny bird of some kind
out there she said do you suppose
its a cape pigeon this far from land
do you know how far from land
we are or where we are headed

  my father hasnt told me-

  the line was deeper between her
brows

  that bird is the lucky one i said
no cormorant has him in his clutches

he can go as he wills hes-free-

  i turned away and hung at the rail
staring out upon the vast unkindly ex-
panse of the waters

  what do you mean  she asked
with a little pulse of feeling

  im waiting thats all till you get
ready to go forward and then im
going with you

  she had made no game of her nature
-this girl no lending of it for the
shabby counters and small change of
trickeries and pretense it was there
unwasted by the tawdry dishonesties of
sex and sentiment of the sun and
the air and the open spaces true as the
southeast trade in its purity she had
become for me something infinitely fine

-remote-

  and yet baffling as the zephyr in her
charm in her lighter play of word and
thought of gesture and laughter i
knew that too who had followed the
lure of her without hope warm with
youth dear and desirable and sweet-

tempered with it all no spark of
malice

  when she spoke she was trying to
give me the best of it as she always did
with every one as it was her impulse
to do

  something has worried you mr
keating she said hesitantly i dont
believe it can be as bad as you think
im sure of it wouldnt it be better if
we talked more simply

  i cant i answered its my own
trouble so far very largely i-ill just
wait dont mind me

  some thought checked her her eyes
softened though she drew away a bit

  i seem to have heard-you havent
been altogether well lately have you
mr keating she said with all gen-
tleness i-im sorry

  i stepped close constrained at last
to lay some smirch of this thing upon
her

  listen please believe im not mad
you must have wondered yourself
about this strange trip-the restraint
upon us all-the power thats been
raised upon us your fathers rnorose-
ness-for one thing i cant tell you
what it all means miss kendrick

though ive been close to death-

  she stared at me the color waning
in her face i had driven her fairly
back upon her own doubts for doubts
she must have had i saw that

  this is my fathers vessel mr keat-
ing

  are you so sure i wish i were
sure-and of what he means to do are
you 

  she winced

  it is true i hardly know my father
she said ive scarcely seen him since
i was a child he only took me this
time because my aunt had died and i
couldnt live with strangers any longer

and-

  she paused a bit unsteadily

  what his ways or his secrets or
his-difficulties may be i cant judge
the terror



he has never told me he shuts me
out but-he is my father

  because she had doubted-for that

very reason-

  it was inevitable she should meet
my effort so despisiug me and yet
i could see no better how say her
father was hurling us all over the rim
of the world to the unknown how
explain the ominous power of the mate
the malevolent crew without seeming
to condemn the author of it all

  what do you want me to do she
asked

  and as frankly i told her

  go straight to the bridge stay by
your father talk to him get through
his reserve see if you can rouse him
to a sense of what lies doing has done
question him keep clear of the mate
and trust nobody on this unhappy ship
from this moment

you think its necessary all that
ill tell you one thing i think i
think that about the one chance a cer-
tain victim has is your loosening the
clutches on him

  its not so serious- she mur-
mured looking away

  and you i pressed havent you
felt it are you quite at ease-satis-
fied

  she would not yield

  with my father absolutely thank

  and with-bane

  her color flooded back

  i avoid mr bane im capable of
attending to that without direction

really mr keating-

  the crew i insisted this gang
you are easy among them that pirate
over there by the boat for instance
and you here alone

  and then she laughed again with a
touch of vexation perhaps but with
whole-hearted relief she had found
what she sought a break in the strain
i was building to her in her inno-
cence the whole thing must have

seemed overwrought an access of rant-
ing fantasy so far was her concep-
tion from the grim and monstrous
reality

  she laughed and at the moment i
was taken full aback for i with what
i knew and feared and had undergone
was equally removed from her own
view

  are these your terrors she cried
that pirate as you call him is my
very good friend why its carl

  she was not angered only glad-
dened and relieved to prove me wrong
to quell her own misgivings it may be

  carl i repeated amazed

  see how absurd you are

  you trust this-carl

  i would absolutely-if there were
any occasion so would any one i
think poor lad-to make a horrible
example of him

  it was my turn to stare

chapter viii

  the matter of carl stands apart in
my mind a chapter often skipped by
thumbing recollection it will not bear
thinking of a great deal and indeed i
might readily pass its details but for
the baleful light it threw upon the col-
leen baum and the extremity of our
peril aboard her

  i can never say i appeared in it with
any especial credit no exploit nor to
be presented as such merely one of
those vivid human flashes that come
athwart a big experience they hap-
pen in life and a chap goes on but
they would be fatal to the complacent
poise of your conquering hero so they
dont happen in books which is one
reason why fiction is so much stranger
than fact perhaps

  i descended forthright upon carl
he was one of the hands i had never
noticed particularly a great sprawl-
ing lout i thought him misshapen by
the drudgery of the sea with a tangle

of light hair huge hands and a dull
face like the end of a butter firkin not
so dull however but it showed a sul-
len uneasiness when i strode toward
him

  i had a great notion of caution in
this it was altogether likely there were
watchers forward i had no mind to
draw them any nearer and when i sat
on the edge of the hatch cover it would
have seemed i was only idly interested
in observing the long climb and fall of
the vessel before me

  the fellow carl continued at his
work stripping the tarred canvas cover
from the quarterboat and stowing it
away another time i might have
wondered to see him so employed i
spoke sidelong at him gauging my
voice to his ear

  you big flap-eared swede you
what the hell do you mean by annoy-
ing miss kendrick

  he was half kneeling on the deck
by the rail break wrestling with a sec-
tion of stiff canvas amazement opened
on me two eyes as wide and watery
blue as oyster shells when he slumped
around

  huh the little lady- he stam-
mered

  youve been speaking to her
youve been bothering her you stay
still and answer right there-whats
your little game

 i never-

  dont tell me whatve you been
hanging around her for who put you
up to it

  squatting there on his canvas he
twisted his great hands and as i
watched an expression of the most
helpless dismay spread upon his broad
features his chest heaved once i
remember how the faded letters on his
old blue jersey a relic of service aboard
some british india boat stood plain for
an instant then

  i dont bother he cried in a per-
fect gale of protest no i never

that lady she been gude friend of
mine always she been so kind gude
morning carl gude morning miss
dont you say i bother her if anybody
bother that little lady by gol i smash
him

  i was as upset as he checked in full
tilt by an emotion that belittled my
own that condemned me on the spot
for a meddling truculent why the
ridiculous creature was actually at the
point of tears i felt like one who has
stupidly wronged a child

  does she say i bother her

  no no i said hastily

  he subsided turning a timid glance
aft toward where i had left her and
i sat looking down at the clumsy bulk
of him in what was very close to con-
sternation here was anticlimax to my
ferment if you like a villain who
turned out to be a sentimentalist a
caliban who could weep

  you signed on at sydney i
charged making what recovery i could

  he nodded

  youre one of that lot

  his face was blank again

  i got no lot dont been with any
lot

  it was the mate got you your job

  no he answered capn ken-
rick

  i began to understand partly this
was one of the few men on board who
were not of banes choosing taken
on the dock head by the skipper him-
self before that precious outfit was
herded up the gangway an outsider
like myself

  then you didnt know your ship-
mates before

  anger suddenly rumbled in his throat
and i got one wild spark from those
colorless eyes

  no by gol no-i never dont
want to know none of them now

  and they-have they left you
alone

  better they da
the terror



  he wiped a fist across his mouth
awkwardly and stared at it doubled like
a ham

  youve had a run-in already

  he began plucking at the canvas
again

  messed one up maybe

  two

  i understood still better this man
this extraordinary misfit had been liv-
ing in the forecastle at bared fang with
the whole bunch i had some faint idea
of what that life must have been

  did they want you to join them-
take part in some scheme

  he said nothing hitching the canvas
free and going on with his work closing
up like a clam now that his burst of
denial had been made

  theyre up to something and wanted
you along i persisted or-maybe
they only warned you to keep your
mouth shut

  that drew a sullen glance from him

  come i urged theres deviltry
you know it i know it what are they
up to

  he shook his head he would not
speak it was the stubbornness of a
rock of a man with one thought like-
ly he had held it from the start i began
to fear he would hold it still with me
as with them

  look here carl heres the little
lady shes in danger you must know
that youve been watching over her

  i saw that it was so i wondered how
much we had to thank the dogged si-
lent giant that disaster had been warded
off so far we could not know we
never did know

  i made one more trial of him

  carl im trying to take care of her
to keep her from harm shes not the
kind to find trouble that little lady
she wont listen will you speak to
her will you help me

  came the rumble in his throat again

  if anybody touches the little lady
i smash him he said with a heavy

iteration of purpose that marked its
limit

  for such was the curious end we
came to beyond that he would not go
neither betray the doings or plans of
his fellows who were also his enemies
because he was made that way with
that strange streak of loyalty and
having chosen his course he would stick
through threats or blandishments

  he crouched there at his work a
great lumbering hulk of a man turn-
ing a shoulder to me as to some buzzing
pest deaf locked again with the one
red flower of emotion that flared in the
dim chamber of his mind unheeding
aloof-

  very well

  i got up and went to ellen and with
a gesture led her down past the quar-
terboat she did not understand but
the man did and i saw the tips of his
ear flush as he bent over his task

  carl i called aside as we came
up what do you say now

  he squirmed he fumbled at the can-
vas with huge wandering hands we
paused there while the deck tilted
up and down again while ellens
glance questioned me mildly while the
unseen watchers forward i suppose
craned to see what we had to do with
the man who didnt belong without
so much as lifting his head he spoke
and this was the astonishing thing he
flung at us

  run on-run on f gol sake
miss dont you see them been spy
you do what he tells you that little
faller

  and so we left him kneeling there
by the break in the rail for ellen
without a word and with a face gone
white as the spray turned forward with
me

  gude morning miss he mumbled
touching his ragged cap

  good morning carl she answered
mechanically

  the last i saw of him he was sprawl-

ing at the canvas a huge loutish fig-
ure doggedly at work sullen alone

chapter ix

  we went slowly not to seem in any
alarm down from the poop picking
our way along the deck it was a jour-
ney to strain better nerves than mine

  i saw the turbaned rascal slip by on
the other side-a frenchman that
chap with a ticket to noumea stamped
plain as print on his hangdog brow
my pussy-footed friend perrin ducked
from somewhere and favored me with
a sneaking grin there were more of
them near lurking for some chance
it might be some order ringing us
with sly surveillance but none of them
spoke nor hindered

  suspense dragged upon our steps like
shackles-mine at least ellen seemed
calm though very pale i kept my re-
volver close to hand-

  in all i suppose we took three min-
utes to reach the bridge certainly not
more than five for we were not much
minded to linger any great time we
paused by the rail once and again when
the vessel lurched wide five minutes
say but within that space the thing
had happened

  we had just topped the ladder and
were turning for the house with a first
easier breath when the yell started
rocketing from aft mounting the keen
blare of the gale long drawn and
mournful a sailor tumbled past be-
low through the alleyway from the fore
deck others popped from the focsle

  ma-an orboard

  hammer of feet hoarse clamor of
voices split by the shrill of the bosns
whistle the ship boiled with sudden
excitement as if a stage wait had
ended with a clap of hands that sent the
company breaking from the wings

  it was a singular thing to me even
as i stood there how the impact
glanced from me surprise and appre-

hension i felt but no throb of convic-
tion of the eager pity and resolve men
know at that cry the running and
shouting figures had the sham effect of
ill-trained actors who overplayed their
parts for the impression i might have
been in a balcony looking down over
the footlights coldly

  i watched the bearded face of far-
ralone jim leap by beneath me uplifted
bawling with little red-rimmed eyes
bright as jet i got the flash somehow
of repulsive burlesque as of a wide
slack mouth grinning behind the heavy

beard-

  came captain kendrick bouncing
like a flabby purple ball but lashing or-
ders with rapid-fire precision he was
real at least i caught the thrill from
him the man was rejuvenated for the
moment whatever his flaws he was
still the skipper keying to command at
the call

  some one had signaled the engine
room with a jangle of bells

  throw that back he roared to the
upper bridge -full ahead there put

her a-stabbord jam her over-

  he took one slide of it by the ladder
to the deck

  clear away that stabbord boat
lively you swabs-get aft

  when i turned again ellen was gone
from my side she had slipped from
me and was following her father too
late to catch her there was no help
for it and indeed it might still be best
that she should be near him i could
not tell in the whirl of the emergency
but i could and did race back after
her to the poop deck where a swarm
clotted about the quarterboat

 even to my lubberly eye they
seemed rather vigorous than effective
crossing and hustling each other haul-
ing and shouting with unnecessary up-
roar 

  bring her up-lift her downhaul

there-slack away-

  a squat ruffian with thin hairy arms
the terror



blundered back against me as he tailed
at a rope and i was crisped to hear a
harsh chuckle of oh-he-yo cheer-
ly men from his lips some new
devilment was up-some cynic villainy
-i scrambled to reach ellen-

  kendrick fell into the thick of them
like a bolt of wrath striking out with
fist and boot

  avast clear that tackle are y
all gone soft-headed you and you
swing her out-y pithless sons of ditch
diggers swing

  for the first time in my seeing it
looked open revolt one ripped an
oath at him his arm flailed and the
hairy chap went flat to the deck like an
unhooked flounder there slid a sud-
den hush upon the turmoil-the insuck
of a wave before its foaming-i
dragged ellen out from them seeking
to get our backs to some barrier

  there never yet had been a moment
in which the cabin guard offered such
easy prey to any outbreak vve were
in the seething mob of them it was a
trap i believe in a stinging flick of
anger a trap for me alone perhaps-
or for all of us the waited climax
of disaster-the crash that had hung
suspended so long-

  bane arrived out of nowhere ap-
parently

  two words and a gesture and it was
over the men turning obediently to their
ropes all murmurs suppressed the boat
being swung handily outboard and
there stood kendrick roaring on with
his orders and the mate quietly at his
side

  his doing of course why i could
not know save that it suited him but
how-i had seen that with the ease
of sure control as if he held a string on
every will of them and had simply to
tighten his fingers one instant a mu-
tiny at the crest the next a prompt
and busy crew this was the kind of
man who was running the colleen
bazvn

  he drew the skipper a step

  can she live in that sea sir do you
think he asked respectfully

  we all stared out over the clamber-
ing blue slopes where the wind now
risen to fury winnowed its spume at
every plunge the colleen falling off
slowly now in answer to her helm lay
like a chip on the breast of an ava-
lanche at every lift we saw her
whitened trail tracked away over hill-
tops in thin loops-nothing more

  a man went overboard i believe
said the captain hard-lipped

  somebody heaved him a life ring
soothed the mate

  im bound to make a try

  of course sir i dont question-
but wouldnt it be better-

  well 

  were coming round if hes afloat
well see him time enough then i
suggest

  he had his way in the end the boat
was held on the blocks and we waited
while the ship labored her long circle
it seemed to me she must have traveled
miles since that cry for myself i was
not seaman enough to know the right
of it a terrific sea the little craft
would hardly have weathered it bane
was plausible-

  i think i had not realized until that
moment why we were all come my
skepticism at the start our own peril
had blurred the raw surface fact a
man was missing some poor wretch
was fighting for life out there with the
chill combers so they all said so it
must be i wondered at my curious
unbelief

  the skipper sighted the life ring
far away to starboard as we ran down
a dot of red and white pricked out and
as speedily erased in the smoking
welter we saw it again presently and
quite plainly tossed against a darker
patch-

  empty searching of eye or glass
discovered nothing else afloat


new story magazine

  never reached it said kendrick
gruffly

  im afraid not sir the water is
very cold must have crumpled him
up

  i moved off from them to the rail
where i could look out beyond the end
of the suspended boat the hands stood
apart in a little knot now whispering
among themselves

  the man was gone blotted in that
immensity a man i had seen had

spoken with perhaps some man-

  who was it i heard kendrick ask
at last

the answer came just as my eyes
dropped to the deck before me came
in banes quiet incisive tones like a
blow like a blinding spark in darkness
that young swede carl

  i put out a hand to push ellen away
i heard her gasp behind me i moved
back like a sleepwalker wakened at
the edge of a precipice the place be-
fore my feet was the exact spot at the
break in the rail where we had left the
man carl some minutes before
anybody see him go

  lost his balance off the bitts they
tell me sir

  it was a lie a damnable and guilty
lie-

  i still tried to pifsh ellen away-to
shield her but when i touched her
quivering body i knew  had-not been
quick enough she had seen she too
had seen the mute evidence the
terrible trace at the edge of the plank-
ing there where carl had knelt crim-
son splashed on the yellow teak-

new crimson-

  desperately then i snatched her to
me with rude hand stifled her cry
wrenched her away

  say nothing i implored whisper-
ing unless were all to go the same

way- brave-be brave

  and so somehow got her back to the
house without drawing attention while

the murderers played out their tragic
farce behind us

chapter x

  this was the manner of my meeting
with carl and of my losing him noth-
ing that happened on that fateful voy-
age not my own narrow escapes our
subsequent suffering threw me to such
a profound and paralyzing depression

  afterward i had the lift of action
the urge of a known issue here i
reached the depths without understand-
ing hope or support of any kind the
black imps of the unknown could drag
me no lower

  i fought it out in the early watches
of the night and if i did not succumb
it was because i never should succumb
to any earthly torment of mystery and
fear i fought it out and i found that
i could still go on

  bane had made no move to withdraw
the offer of his cabin i had profited
accordingly and it was there i lay fully
dressed on the bunk staring with wide
eyes at the shift and loom of shadows
thrown from the swinging candle light

  the mates quarters aboard the col-
leen cut in between the chart room and
the captains large double cabin on the
starboard side to port the corre-
sponding section was part of the cap-
tains suite ordinarily held for a pos-
sible passenger and now occupied by
his daughter

  it was some little comfort to me to
be so near her in the ships natural
fortress she was just behind the fore
and aft partition asleep i could wish
after the heavy shock of the day

  immediately on getting her to the
bridge i had prevailed upon her to re-
tire to her berth and remain there be-
wildered and terrified she had prom-
ised and that was well for one look
at her face would have told bane that
she had learned something of the hor-
ror she had seen no one since save
the terror



possibly her father to whose quarters
she had access by an inner door i
trusted she might find rest

  for myself there was none the
phantoms flocked about me and i strug-
gled with them there hour by hour the
sweat standing on my face the nails
driven in my palms seeking vainly to
draw coherence from the whirl of the
ghastly enigma

  the murders-of carl and the stoker
stevens and i marked for a third
outsiders all three with the crew for
that very reason apparently they
were auditing the roll with a big red
pencil crossing off the undesirables in
ferocious deliberate strokes

  but why do men kill in a pack for
the number of a mess or the address
of a crimp why should they have
to be rid of us-harmless and common
folk fear or greed were any other
motives thinkable greed or fear
greed that was coolly cutting down the
list of possible sharers in some enter-
prise or fear that would tolerate no
witnesses to some great crime

  perhaps you see where my thoughts
were already tending-piracy aye i
had come to that before me always
was the bulking question of our strange
cruise for which i had yet found no
answer piracy was the only word dark
enough to cover the thing

  but who ever heard of a steam tramp
turned pirate even in the south seas
where so many wild improbabilities sur-
vive these days of lloyds and twenty-
knot cruisers of cables and coast sur-
veys of brass-buttoned fussiness and
international patrols and in the name
of all the rovers from bartholomew
roberts down what pirate ever sought
loot in this empty end of the world

  bilboe machan had said but there
all inquiry slipped like grasping fingers
on a sheet of glass bilboe was van-
ished these many years bilboe was a
myth anyway bilboe and his port
boys-

  i dwelt on that i had not over-
looked the insistence with which the
hint had cropped our crew it ap-
peared might bear some relation to
that old lawless fraternity ruffians
and sea scamps all banded in some
sinister agreement recruited in a body
and by the same man held in leash by
his authority alone but supposing it
was so i was no nearer the light no
nearer understanding their intent or
banes or the skippers-

  there was the marvel the skipper
the man of secrets whose secrets had
become his disease he had started it
all he had submitted to banes man-
agement now i found him mistrust-
ful of every one even his master try-
ing to exorcise the power he had raised
but why  and what made him to start
at a shadow and why had his cabin
been searched as he said and if he
was at odds with the crew why had
he not been killed ere this

  bane himself the spider at the
center of the web i could make noth-
ing of him whatever he had gained
the captain he had filled the ship
with his creatures now he was in
virtual command able to do as he
pleased

  were the murders by his order or
only without his prohibition was it
only a whim that kept him dallying
with the situation a stratagem in
sheer mockery  ellen perhaps some
notion of fending the crash until he
had won her by subtler arts it would
be like him-but how much longer
would he be content to hold his pas-
sion within bounds

  you figure me there drawn and
strung like a man on the rack fight-
ing with the terror while the sea noises
and the tiny tongues of the ship gib-
bered in my ear and the dim shadows
writhed above on the roof plates the
same helpless little supercargo-i
wonder

  i wondered even then for the half


new story magazine

of a day i had been the battered toy of
events it was curious to find that
emotion no longer ran singly in the
groove of self-pity that i felt and
thought and saw so much outside my
shrinking little defects my troubled lit-
tle weakness with the reserve faculty
of a tortured sleeper in his nightmare
-i wondered-

  it must have been along about two
bells of the middle watch that my pain-
ful vigil ended the motion of the
steamer had moderated sensibly during
the night and through the lessened
murmur of sound came voices my
gaze fixed upon a small square venti-
lator at the top of the partition above
the bunk the close grating showed a
gleam of light from the captains cabin
i drew myself to my feet on the bunk
but could distinguish nothing beyond
the hum and return of two speakers

  i had no compunction in what i was
about to do only the great need to
know to catch a thread that might
lead me one step in the maze there
had been a time when i should have
shrunk from scruple-from lack of
the mere will that time was long past

  with the thick blade of my knife i
began to work at the screws of the
grating the clumsy tool slipped

scored my hand snapped- i toiled

on with the stump

  inside of five minutes i was clamping
to the shelf one knee on a chronometer
bracket thrust up through the open-
ing toward another grating on the cap-
tains side

chapter xi

  and these were the first words that
drifted up to me in the unmistakable
quaver of kendrick

  who told em of a black wallet
hey who told em such a yarn
fore god ill give up nothing whered
they get the notion i kept a wallet

  i heard and yet could scarce believe

i heard the instant reflex was swift
suspicion of another trick a wallet
a black wallet perrins shallow in-
coherent tale-

  the smooth accents of bane cut
across smooth and edged like a cres-
cent blade

  you make me weary old man-
weary does a fellow go fifty-three
south after butterflies or human
hair do you suppose they wouldnt
know what you were after quick as
they learned your course why its
been common drift from pitcairn to
thursday any time these ten years-
that story

  what story

  the bosn that lived to get back
the bosn you know picked up some-
where in the amsterdams sitting on
a rock in a kelp surplice howling hymns
at the sea gulls but he had the wallet
oh he had the wallet right enough
and he came back zvith the wallet
where its traveled since would make
queer telling anyway it takes no
solomon to guess youve got it now

  i never saw the damn wallet
shrilled the skipper i come on a tip
just the bearings no more i told you
that a hundred times

  so you have but you wouldnt
start on any less a tip than the whole
not you for a fat contented old chap

like you- oh dear no

  wouldnt hey didnt thatgang on
the eliza d smith start out two year
ago on the word of a swab whod only
seen it-only seen it a chinee cook
that couldnt even read scratched the
figgers on a copper boiler and that was
enough for them im doing the same
thats all its a tip-applebone my
mate thats dead tipped me off
applebone brought you the wallet
corrected bane he nipped it up
somehow in yokohama-and when he
passed out next day it wasnt on him
hey what dyou know about ap-
plebone shrilled kendrick
the terror



  oh nothing came the mates sar-
donic answer only-i happened to
he on the trail of the black pocketbook
myself just then and he beat me to
it-

  above them there at the ventilator i
clung and listened in amazement that
after all the bewilderment my first real
clew in the tangle should revert to the
one thing i had most surely discarded-
the larrikins whining excuse nailed
for a motive he had spoken part of the
truth there was an incredible black

wallet-

  none of thats any good kendrick
the mate was saying no good they
know you have it im all for peace
myself-always for peace and order

and discipline-

  i could picture the exact veiling of
his smile upon the cowering victim be-
low

  id leave it with you all proper all
square and proper till the business is
done and everybody paid off as we
agreed but i tell you plainly-theres
no holding them much longer not
much longer

  a lie or you wouldnt say it they
dont breathe cept by your leave flat
mutiny thats all you want to hold
me up-for what i aint got damn it
all bane what could you do with the
wallet spose i did have one

  its the men soothed bane you
know the kind theyre bound to see
it smell it-bite it if you like bound
to handle it for themselves mad with
the notion think what it means all
these years with their tongues hanging
out at the thought besides youve no
manner of claim better than theirs no
better

  i heard the skipper throw himself
back in his chair

  white hands ship a white crew
theyll take their wage and do their
work and never know the differ thats
what you said-and i let you go ahead
your own gang- good god in

heaven look down on me for a poor
damn fool

  there was a moments silence within
the way it stands now theyre all
in kendrick youve got to share all
around anyhow

  the chair creaked kendricks voice
came feebly yet with a certain slow
dignity

  mr bane you know me i believe
since seventy-five i been master on my
own vessels ive made one big mis-
take it seems-i tell you fair mr
bane before i give up anything with
a hand on my throat ill destroy what-
ever information ive got destroy it
so you nor me nor nobody will ever

be the wiser- so help me-

  came a faint clicking in the cabin be-
hind me i snatched around to look
at the door the swinging candle glim
was reflected streakily from the brass
hand knob its image wavered very
slowly the knob was turning-the bolt
took up gently as a weight was urged
against the panels an instant later a
furtive hand tried the fastenings of the
port-

  i dropped softly from the bunk took
out the revolver and spun its cylinder
once as the compact weapon nestled
in my hand a shimmery little tangle
of blued points and surfaces i felt that
there might yet be a good fight in me

  pinching out the candle i drew the
catch of the door without a sound it
came open on the velvet blue haze of
the night an insert against the black
i started low with one arm raised and
leaped out clear across the bridge deck

swinging my gun-

  nothing no stealthy prowler wait-
ing with lifted club no ambuscade of
knives and spikes but the man could
not have gone far i crabbed aft to
the ladder just in time peering below
to see the deck door of the house open
on a blur of light and a figure flit
through like conjuring

  my one thought had been to break


new story magazine

tripled and trouble robert v carr

out of the cabin before i was pinned
there caged but i was started now
roused to the chase i slid the ladder
before the alleyway was dark again and
entered on the heels of my visitor

  quick though i had been the thvvart-
ship passage was empty when i came
through a dim lantern guided me to
the head of the companion some one
was crawling away before me there like
a rat on a cellar stair down i went
then into the dark belly of the ship
with teeth hard set on my resolve and
the big revolver fisted

  the steps turned aft into the little
orlop to starboard of the engine room
they hastened and i jumped to com-
mand the tunnel

  stand i shouted whos there

  the hurry feet stopped dead i
moved forward the pulse beating thick-
ly in my throat

  who goes i demanded pipe up
or ill fire

  i had a curious feeling of a breath
on my cheek but when i fended my
knuckles crashed on woodwork with
fumbling fingers i found a brimstone
match in my pocket flicking it from
me i lighted it on my nail-a bit of
schoolboy magic happily remembered
the head fell some paces away and
flared saffron upon the figure that
crouched beyond with distended eyes
of alarm-

 the man was the one who had
brushed me at the lifeboat rasping a
chantey under his breath a chap hailed
about the decks by the name  of
sachs

  i ran upon him before the flash
failed grabbed his collar and haled
him back to the passage below the com-
panion

  once too often i told him and
jammed the weapon into his neck
what were you after at my cabin
talk fast

to be continued

ive always held that a man kin stand
anything if he will jes put his
mind to it its jes beyond me how
some poor angleworm-backed critters
kin have so little pride in theirselves
as to holler as soon as theyre scratched
or feel a little pain take me and
if i do say it myself no matter whats
ailin me i suffer in silence none of

this groanin or gruntin fer jack jetts
-jes suffer it out im like steel when
it comes to endurin pain-yes siree
like chilled steel

  but them triplet brothers of mine
are diffrent from me-cant stand the
least thing neither of them take the
time jeb got a crick in his neck joe
claims jeb got that crick in his neck
triplets and trouble



from lookin at the girls the last time
we was in miles city jeb dont pay
no tention to joes slurs jes groans
and rubs his neck with some hoss lin-
ment

  yet after a spell jeb has to have his
little whine

  it jes seems he sniffles when i
go to look at something the world has
done come to an end

  joe laughs a cruel laugh

  i warned you teases brother joe
you would be a-snappin your head
at them miles city fillies youd no
more than see one pretty maid than
youd jerk your head around to see
another if you could think about
something besides skirts once in a while
maybe you wouldnt be gruntin around
with a charley hoss in your neck fol-
ler my smoke you never hear me
botherin my head about girls

  oh no growls jeb as full of sar-
casm as a rattler of pisen oh no
you never talk about the girls well
i never heard you talk about anything
else youre always rainbowin about
some piece of calico

  theres where you dont understand
your dear brother joe joshes him fer
that same joe kin be a cunnin- devil
at times take us litrary fellers and
we got a sacred right to dream about
the little maids all i has to do to
have thoughts of music as the feller
says is to think of some girl with the
roses in her cheeks and the sunlight
in her eyes

  pass the mush mother growls jeb
you cant slip any of that suds and
sunshine down my neck joe jetts
when i think about the girls i think
right and its how much theyve cost
me take a girl and all she thinks
of is what youre goin to bring her
if you aint got nothin fog on pretty
boy fog on that litrary stuff reads
all right but its fur from the trooth
then jeb turns his head all of a

    

sudden and his neck hurts and he
cusses something frightful

  then i breaks in

  jeb i tells him like a true friend
and brother no real man will grunt
like you do over a little pain you
cer-tin-ly make me ashamed that im
related to you a little crick in the
neck and you a-whinin like you was
nigh to kickin out

  thats what i say chimes in joe
fer a wonder takin sides with me
a man shows what hes made of by
the way he endures pain take us
litrary fellers and we never holler
under no con-dition

  i gave joe a quick sharp look but
said nothin he was on my side fer
once and i couldnt afford to ree-fer
to some things i knowed about him

  take me joe goes on widenin
his loop take me and grind me up in
a machine and ill never whimper
though i has a ree-fined nature i kin
suffer as brother jack says in silence
you has many good points jeb but
standin pain aint one of them i
aint a word to say agin you as a
brother but when it comes to standin
pain you fall a little short jeb-jes
a little short

  jeb seein that were both agin him
dont try to fight-jes groans and holds
his neck and so we lets up on him
later in the day i feels like spurrin
brother jeb some more and makes a
few ree-marks about a full-grown man
a-babyin around with a crick in his
neck

  jeb comes up close to me and looks
me fair in the eye

  jack he says and theres no mis-
takin the look in his eye dont drive
me too fur im in a terrible con-dition
as any man kin see i think youre
lackin a whole lot in kindness to hur-
raw a suffrin brother

  thats all right jeb i comes back
but its fer your own good when
i git anything the matter with me and


new story magazine

whine or show the white feather you
kin hurraw me fer all youre worth
and never a word will i say

  you have stated my views to an
ants whisker agrees joe i makes
the same offer if something happens
to me and i whine jes you trot out
all the cruel ree-marks you kin think
of im thinkin youll never have the
chance fer like jack ill suffer in
silence

  fer gosh-amightys sake keep still
you two howls jeb all of a sudden
youre drivin me loco with your gab-
blin 

  joe titters and begins hummin

  jeb jeb poor old jeb

    he got a crick in his neck

  he snapped his head at some cal-i-co
   and now his lifes a wreck

  jeb then reaches fer his gun and we
leave him be

  well after a spell between the hoss
medicine and cussin jeb finally gits
the crick out of his neck and is his old
self agin

  about that time joe begins to look
a little sad and sort of set around alone
by and by he admits that hes the
makins of a boil under his collar jeb
grins a little and insists on lookin at
joes boil i take gappins at it too
its a daisy and growin fast

  joe i advises him after hed been
awake two or three nights with his boil
and kept us jumpin sideways with
poultices and other truck that there
young mountain on your neck is ripe
fer carvin

  jeb is lyin on his bunk readin a
love story but he sets up and joins
right in with me

  thats the idee joe that there
little raise on your neck should be
slashed always heard that when a
boil comes to a head the proper deal
is to stick it well slash her with a
razor

  i must say that joe hasnt whimpered

much but when we go to talkin razor
he looks kind of sick

  all you have to do joe says jeb
cruel as a wolf is to suffer in silence
recollect what you said when i had
a crick in my neck you made up a
piece of potry about it even why
dont you make up something on a
boil

  jeb is right i tells joe a boil
is nothin be a man joe and let us
carve her it will all be over in a
second one slash and its good-by
boil

  by that time jeb has got the razor
and is stroppin it and testin the edge
joe looks at him like a dyin calf

  i goes over to joe sayin to brother
jeb over my shoulder ill hold his
head

  now joe jetts is a game fighter and
afraid of nothin that walks besides
he is a top cow-puncher and will crawl
on to any outlaw that ever sunfished
but when it comes to havin cold steel

laid across a boil-

  joe looks up into our faces as pitiful
as a lost child

  boys he whimpers you couldnt
be so cruel to a brother what has al-
ways been good to you you couldnt
carve me-you couldnt carve me

  its fer your own good says the
hard-hearted jeb and im forced to
agree with him jeb flourishes the
razor and rolls up his sleeves

ill give her the cross slash jeb
hands it out to joe one slash north
and one slash east that will fix her
i wonder moans joe if theres
a drop of licker on the place

  that aint fair decides jeb mighty
short a man stands up agin the steel
without the help of licker your time
has come joe-your time has come
its up to you to show what youre
made of

  maybe it aint come to a head yet
says joe prayin fer time you hadnt
ought to stick it till its blossomed
triplets and trouble



  dont worry about that i braces
him and gittin a good grip on his head
shes ripe all right all right come
on jeb with the steel

  poor joe seein that hes gone goes
limp under my hands then jeb with
a wink at me makes a few false mo-
tions with the razor and then ka-
zooric he slashes the boil

  joe peeps twice and falls back in
my arms in spite of all i kin do i
has to laugh jeb jes whoops and
hollers

  when joe comes to and gets squared
around he takes a good look at me
and brother jeb

  have all the fun you want but let
me tell you there is no livin man what
wont holler if you twist him hard
enough

  well you sure hollered i reminds
him

  yes and he was the boy who was
tellin me how to stand pain jeb
rowels him

  joe is feelin fairly good now and
he begins to take up the talk agin

  suppose he says and hes got a
imagination like an old maid suppose
the injuns captured you jack first
say they pulls your toenails and then
trims your ears-swallowforks both
your wind fans then say they lay
a red-hot ramrod across your eyes
then suppose after that they take off
an inch of your hide at a time what
do you reckon youd do under them
con-ditions dont you figger that
youd holler

  never a cheep out of me i tells
him flat- id look them red devils
right in the eye and die game as a white
man should

  joe complains jeb dont go into
details about injun torture agin you
got a way of dee-scribin a thing that
gives me the jerks that toenail-pullin
idee starts my mind to millin im
free to say that when they went to
work on my feet id yell till you could

hear me in omaha i was always tick-
lish about the feet

  thems my sentiments declares
joe who is jes as likely to argue fer
a thing one minute and agin it the
next about the time they lifted my
hoof you could hear me holler on
tother side of jordan

  i am com-pelled to laugh i see that
i has about all the cold nerve of the
jetts family jeb got whiny with a
crick in his neck and joe let a boil
make him white around the gills im
all thats left to keep the name of jetts
lookin like it belonged to nervy white
men

  i tells them boys jes exactly how
i would come through that injun tor-
ture-game to the last askin no mercy
a white man and a stayer they see
that i had em and jes shut up peo-
ple that have whined about a little
crick in tht neck or a boil aint much
to say about what theyd do in injun
torture bout all they kin do is to
keep still while a real man tells em
where to head in

  in a day or two were headed fer
the stage station to git the mail we
never got no mail but we always went
fer it

  i dont know why i never noticed
it before but that mornin i got a little
suspicion that my left jaw was be-
ginnin to swell as we rode along i
begin to see that i was kerrect in that
there suspicion bout a mile from the
stage station one of my left-hand
grinders begin to rar and charge and
speak pieces

  im forced to tell them brothers of
mine jes in a careless way that i
think im due to have the toothache

  jeb looks at joe and joe looks at
jeb both of the miserable hounds
grin like theyd jes thought of some
joke

  well advises jeb who when you
come to know him has the nature of
a devil jes hang on to your nerve a


new story magazine

toothache is nothin aside of havin your
toenails lifted im surprised you even
mentions it whats toothache as agin
injun torture

  thats what gits me breaks out
joe a man of jacks nerve men-
tionin a triflin thing like the tooth-
ache queer very queer

  say and i know i hadnt ought to
talk about a brother this way but that
joe jetts regardless of his litrary
ways has one of the crudest natures
this side of the jump-off he has a
cunnin cruelty joe has

  by that time that grinder has got
a collar-and-elbow holt on my brain
and is beginnin to hang and twist-
hang and twist i pets my jaw with
my finger its swelled some

  all i got to say laughs jeb to joe
is that i hope we dont meet no pocket
gophers they might take jack fer
a brother of theirn he sure looks a lot
like one

  thats what joe agrees sure a
strong family resemblance between
jack jetts and a pocket gopher

  im in no shape to take up their in-
sults i now sees that my only hope is
to beg borrow or steal some whisky
at the stage station and be durned soon
about it too id always heard that
whisky was good fer the toothache
anyway i was willin to try it every
minute the old bean masher was
a-pitchin harder and faster by the
time we racked into the stage station
she was jumpin seven ways fer sun-
day and cornin down hard

  bout half crazy and a-packin my
face in my hands i runs around tryin
to locate some licker but my luck
was agin me not a drop in the place
plum discouraged and all in i set
down on a wagon tongue and try to
con-trol my jaw i had to hold it tight
with both hands or it would a jumped
out of my face

  jeb and joe both come up to me
grinnin like hell cats

  all you got to do advises jeb
in a slow draggy irritatin voice is
to show the red devils how a white
man kin suffer and die

  you have spoken a great trooth or
words to that effect adds joe

  i looks up at them and then hangin
on to my jaw ree-marks cold and des-
prate

  remember the limit boys men
have kicked out with their boots on
fer less than you two have said to me
anyhow it will all be over in a little
while i cant live this way much
longer

  they grin but dont say nothin fer
a spell

  finally jeb suggests why not go
to town and have it yanked out you
cant stand that pain much longer
thats the idee joe trails in right
in after jeb go to town and have
the condemned thing jerked out
then with a wink at jeb it hadnt
ought to hurt more than a crick in the
neck or a boil it hadnt ought to take
as much nerve to have a tooth yanked
as to have a boil carved i never had
a tooth pulled but they say it dont feel
no worse than havin your brain scraped
with a garden hoe

  ive heard tell jeb explains nice
and cheerful that havin a tooth pulled
is a whole lot like havin your head
weatherboarded but jack wouldnt
mind a little thing like that them
nervy devils like jack jes set right
down and let one of them tooth jerkers
yank out every nipper they got and
crack jokes while hes doin it of
course you and me joe would cheep
a little but take jack and im here
to say hell suffer in silence-suffer
in silence

 fer some derned reason joe
smoothes a grin offn his freckled face
-the homely son of a gun

  i see plain enough that them scoun-
drels have got it in their heads that i
aint the nerve to waltz into town and
triplets and trouble



haye that tooth jerked they require
to be shown and im the boy that kin
show em

  i ties a handkerchief around my jaw
jumps my hoss and yells out of one
side of my mouth

  come on you two cold-hearted
coyotes im goin to show you what
a nervy man kin do some day youll
want a little sympathy from me and
youll git nothin but sneers and in-
sults

  they laughs backward and for-
ward like they has a great joke be-
tween em but dont say nothin

  we fogs it fer town

  now and then i am com-pelled to
stop fer a sup of hot water although
i inquires fer whisky all along the
trail one feller had some wood al-
cohol but my brothers thought id bet-
ter ask a doctor before tacklin that
stuff not a drop of real licker in the
country it was a killin ride

  before we reaches town my old
grinder had quit her regler pitchin
and got down to fancy buckin shed
go up in the air whirl twice hit the
ground all spraddled out and
throw herself over nine sections of
land then up shed come agin fall
backward fer eleven miles and land
on her ear in a pile of rock sometimes
shed sail turnin over and over and
then all of a sudden fall fer days
sickishlike once she took a run and
jump and batted out her brains agin a
stone wall anyhow thats how it felt

  jumpin judas h priest boys i
am com-pelled to ree-mark aint there
nothin in this suffrin world you kin
do fer me ill go crazy in a minute
nothin replies jeb and ill leave
it to you if you ever heard of a cruder
man bein allowed to live but call your
attention to them ree-marks of yourn
con-cernin injun torture

  joe is softer-hearted than jeb and
tries to jolly me along but there is
nothin you kin say to jolly a man with

the toothache all he kin do is to hang
on to his jaw with both hands and
pant fer air all a real friend kin do
fer him is to take a club and knock
him in the head and put him out of his
misery

  in seven hundred and fifty-four
years nine months seven weeks five
days twenty-three hours forty-nine
minutes and fifty-eight seconds we gits
in sight of town i know jes how
long it took us fer i put in my time
figgerin

  im fer headin into a saloon and
drinkin it out of house and home but
jeb wont let me hes appointed his-
self round-up boss and im too mis-
erable to fight him im so crazy with
pain that im willin to admit anything
i sure overlooked the jumpin tooth-
ache when i took that stand on injun
torture injun torture is a shampoo as
compared to the pitchin toothache

  we rides up to the buildin where a
dentist has his death trap upstairs i
lets go all holts and falls offm my
hoss with a brother supportin me
on each side i stumbles up the stairs

  then a funny thing happens bury
me alive fer a liar if that tooth dont
cam right down and quit achin its
the cam after a storm soothin and
quiet

  i stops in my tracks and laughs
it werent no full-grown laugh but it
was a laugh jes the same

  boys i tells my brothers mighty
relieved shes done quit achin no
use in goin further lets head back
to a saloon and drink to my recoverin
from a little spell of illness as the
feller says

  jeb laughs his old heartless cruel
laugh

  that old dodge wont work jack
jetts he sneers you cant pull
nothin over us that-o-way thats
what all the chicken hearts say when
their nerve bogs down come on the
red devils are waitin


new story magazine

  did you ever notice how easy some
folks kin say come on when its
the other fellers funeral jeb jetts
is one of them kind of inhuman devils

  i tries to lay back in the traces but
they pull me up the stairs

  we see a sign on the door walk
in it says jeb and joe walk in
but i drag in

  as we enter that place a feller-
say he was the cruelest-faced man i
ever laid eyes on-stuck his head out
from another room and says in a cold
sneerin voice

  ill be ready fer you in a minute

  thats jes the way he said it like
he had a grudge agin the world no
mercy in that feller-nothin but a dee-
sire to hurt and pain

  we tet down i hung my face in
my hands while jeb and joe looked
around as cheerful as hound pups
while were a-settin there we hears
a deep dyin save-me-im-gone groan
come out of the room where the den-
tist puts the kibosh on his victims
that cruel gobbler has got some poor
yap down and is pullin his soul out
by the roots i never heard such a
sound come out of a mortal there
wasnt enough hope in it to grease the
mainspring on a fleas watch

  hes sure got that gobbler where
he wants him jeb observes grinnin
like he was lookin forward to some-
thing pleasant when a man un-
hitches a cry like that lies hurt where
he lives thats mighty nigh the death
rattle

  you have sure stated a fact agrees
joe when a man jerks a groan like
that out of a feller mortal he has cer-
tin-ly penetrated his inner nature

  sweet encouragin talk if you dont
care what you say

  pretty soon we hear a lot of floun-
derin around and some more of them
down-in-the-well groans

  he wound up his little ball of yarn
that trip laughs jeb nothin left

now but to carry out the remains i
wouldnt give a cent fer whats left
of that poor gazabel plain case of
murder in the first degree

  boys i cheeps tryin to locate the
door im goin after a drink ill be
back directly

  they grab me and slam me down
in the chair

  none of them old dodges jack
jetts warns the heartless jeb if
you dont know enough to pertect your
health me and joe will have to take
charge of you youve made your
brags too and fer the sake of the
jetts name you got to come clean
dont try any of them old ketches or
drives on us they wont work were
jes a little mite too cute fer you
theres no way you kin escape

  but jeb fer heavens sake-

  jes then the poor feller that the
dentist had had down broke away and
bolted past us talkin hog latin and
whirlin his eyes i would have went
with him but jeb and joe caught me
as i was climbin his coat tail

  then the dentist come out and looked
us over seems that something-a little
bird maybe-tells him im the next to
be dragged up to the fire and branded
and ear-marked he lays a moss-agate
eye on me had the eye of a murderer
that detnist had-a dead eye with no
light in it and a long cruel face that
showed no sign of mercy love ner
kindness

  he crooks a long capable finger at
me i try to git up but my feet have
fell asleep and i seem unable to move
jeb and joe help me up and after a
little wabblin i head the death march
it was sure a sicknin outlook

  the dentist dont have much to say
ive always noticed that them natural-
born murderers are short on conversa-
tion

  with the help of my brothers he
slams me down in a sway-backed plush
chair and begins sortin his tools i
triplets and trouble



look around at jeb and joe pleadin
fer help but they stand off from me
like they is ashamed to acknowledge
were related

  the dentist takes out a young
monkey wrench a posthole digger a
hoe and a pair of wire nippers then
he scratches his head like hed over-
looked something and dives down in
his tool chest and brings up a brace and
bit a crosscut saw a bootjack and a
hackamore

  i begin to see that that dentist feller
is a man who believes in bein pre-
pared fer all deals

  he makes a third dive fer more tools
but by that time ive made it to the
door and am on my way back to the
open range but theres no gittin by
jeb and joe they circle me and throw
me back into the chair

  now says the tooth jerker cold
and tiredlike lets have a look at it

  i opens my mouth and he looks in
as fur back as the kitchen

  jeb and joe take a look too

  huh exclaims jeb i thought fer
a minute somebody had opened the
door

  he ought to take that trap down to
the harness makers and have the cor-
ners stitched up says joe thinkin to
be cute

  i cant say nothin back to them
scoundrels fer by that time the dentist
feller has crawled inside and is per-
snippercatin around with a young
crowbar he finds the right grinder
all all right when he found it i slid
down on my neck but that didnt bother
him he jes follered me on down
gougin and diggin

  after a sweatin spell he gits offm
me and says to my brothers have
to extract it

  they yank me up in the chair

  the dentist reaches fer a pair of
tongs

  it wont hurt much lie tells me
about as comfortin as a rattlesnake in

a dark room then to the boys hold
his hands

  wait please wait i begs the
derned thing aint achin a bit

  hold his hands

  my brothers grab me and the dentist
gits up on my chest i cant even blat

  then down come those cold tongs
on that tooth till they dip right into the
jumpin quiverin center of where i
live as soon as hes sure hes fas-
tened he begins what the feller calls
a rotary motion he begins twistin
my face the same as a woman twists
the lid on a jar of preserves

  my stomach come on up in my neck
my heart flopped over

  there it is says the dentist feller
boldin in front of me what i first
thought was a cottonwood stump
one dollar please

  it was some time afterward that i
noticed a pair of boots stickin out
from a clump of sagebrush on lookin
closer i see that them boots belonged
to jeb  jetts joe was near the jug
and the jug was empty we must have
had quite a time fer we was miles
from town

  when we gits all squared around
and lined out fer the ranch jeb looks
at joe and says

  speakin of injun torture-

  enough said i cuts him off sharp
but i cant stop joe from singin when
the spirit moves him

  i even join in the chorus when he
lets go all holts and warbles

  you cant tell what a man will do

   till he does it till he does it

  you never know if hell come through
  till he does it till he does it

   fer talk is cheap and hot air too

   and that hits me and likewise you

  no man alive knows what hell do

   till he does it till he does it

  and so with the understandin that
the best of men has their little weak
spots we fogs across the good old
range
l-iigh in the rockies two big throb-
bing pacific type passenger en-
gines coupled ahead of a long train
of dimly lighted pullmans were rush-
ing number three the empire lim-
ited west over the continental divide

  for nearly five hours the powerful
locomotives had battled the heavy
grades of the east slope climbing
steadily up through the long winding
rockbound defile in which the two bands
of steel which form the main line of
the great southern railway system
creep over the tortuous miles of the
mountain division up through the
treacherous black canon of the rio
chelan up over the lesser grades and
around the long reverse curves west of
riverton and on toward the summit of
the rockies

  at summit spur that isolated tele-
graph station ten thousand feet above
the level of the sea the helper engine
was cut off

  thirty minutes behind her schedule
number three began the descent and
not until the train was roaring down
through the pass west of the broken
bow did the engineer close the throttle
and latch of the big johnston bar down
on the quadrant

  enveloped in the cloud of dense
black smoke which poured from the
stack back over the rapidly moving
train the limited began rolling swiftly
down the crooked iron trail down the
ywest slope toward castle rock which
nestles in the barren foothills on the

prairies edge far below there an-
other purring monster waited to replace
the mountain racer which was whirling
the empire limited over the last stretch
of her night run on the mountain di-
vision

  dave marion was the engineer in the
cab of the limiteds engine that night
he was young in year scarcely thirty-
four but old in the service of the di-
vision and all that goes to make up a
good railroad man was his he was
cool careful fearless and his nerves
were like finely tempered steel he was
big clean and wholesome and when
he looked at you his coal-black eyes
like diamond points seemed to pene-
trate to your very soul

  he knew the railroad game and he
loved it he loved the great grimy
freight pullers he loved the graceful
black shining locomotives that daily
wheeled the overland trains swiftly
east and west over the division he
loved the long fast runs out through
the mountains he loved it all it was
a part of him

  but great as was his love for the rail-
road game there was a slip of a girl at
castle rock who held him with a
stronger love-the love of a good wom-
an she was betty maynard an- engi-
neers daughter and as the life of the
game pulsed through the veins of dave
marion just so it gripped and thrilled
the girl for she loved it too

  leaning over his levers as the lim-
ited swung clear of the pass marion
a mountain division man



glanced at the duplex air gauge he
then swung the handle of the brake
equipment into service immediately
there was a backward tug as the brakes
gripped the wheels everything was all
right he pushed the small brass lever
into full release and then back into
running position they were off on the
last lap of the long run

  keep your eyes open son he
called to the fireman who after cover-
ing his fire had half opened the auto-
matic door and climbed to his seat on
the left were going to roll her in
on time

  im with you till she heads for
glory the fireman shouted back

  the empire limited was a first-class
train made inferior to opposing trains
by time-table designation but as no
superior trains were coming against her
even though she was late the dispatcher
had not given other trains time on her
schedule therefore everything on the
main line should have cleared for her
fully five minutes before her regular
scheduled arrival

  knowing that no train order had
been issued to the effect that number
three was to run late dave marion
leaning from the cab of the big engine
nursed the limited along for every sec-
ond that could be gained for her fly-
ing through the night thirty minutes
late the big engineer had that six-
hundred-ton train responding to his
every touch as though it were a part of
himself

  with the sweep of the wind through
the gangway with the lurch and roll
of the big engine with the thunder of
the racing drivers with the roar of the
swaying coaches behind number three
was every minute creeping back to her
schedule with sinking sickening ter-
rifying lurches the big locomotive
rushed down over the west slope and
during every instant of that flight the
two men in her cab sat silent star-
ing out ahead straining their eyes

against that wall of blackness alert for
the first faint glimmering dot of red

  with a last dizzy breathless swerve
the limited shot from the narrow de-
file of red rock canon out into the
foothills the speed became terrific as
number three began dropping the
miles behind her-one every minute

  frequently the even whir of the train
was broken as with a sharp rattling
clatter they tore over the switches
where green tail lights of long multi-
colored freight trains shimmered at
them from the safety of passing tracks
again for an instant the men in the
cab would catch a momentary glow of
brightness as the solitary eye of some
schedule freight blinked at them from
a lonely siding

  like a weird phantom finger the
limiteds headlight swung from the
shining bands of steel ahead to right
and to left as the train curved and
twisted around the jutting crags of
monster buttes went winding through
high gray-walled canons or wound in
and out among the steep saggy hills
and in quick all-seeing flashes of light
many fantastic shapes were thrown into
relief as the rugged foothills flashed
past them like the flight of a wonder-
ful picture film on a screen

  when the empire limited swung out
onto the high trestle over the big still-
water and went purring across the
dizzy structure leaving behind a vibrant
hum of the steel framework she was
eight minutes behind her schedule and
castle rock was a little more than
twenty miles away

  billy parker the fireman dropped to
the deck and with the long iron hook
broke up his fire preparatory to the
short sharp climb west of helper with
the glaring light from the fire pit still
dancing before him he stepped back
to his seat and strained his eyes for the
home signal which would show first on
his side as the train took the long
sweeping curve


new story magazine

  there was no distant signal by which
the approach of the train might be reg-
ulated but with number three due
everything should have been safely in
the clear

  for just an instant marion eased the
train off with a touch of the air in
service

  white eye the fireman called
across the cab as he caught a glittering
bit of light far down around the curve

  white eye repeated the engineer
as he released the brakes pulled the
throttle wide open and reaching for
the whistle cord sent a long screeching
wail through the night and then as
number three clattered over the out-
lying switches of the yard at helper
there rose above all other sounds the
voice of billy parker a sudden wild
cry

  red eye he staggered toward the
engineer my god dave its red-
the targets red somethings out
against us

  at nearly forty miles an hour they
swept by the home signal from which
glittering high on the mast a tiny dot
of red challenged the rushing train

  close ahead an engines headlight
stared at them from the main line
straight in the path of number three
a light helper engine was crossing
from the helper spur over onto the
second iron where an eastbound live-
stock express awaited the passing of
the limited

  since the beginning of the railroad
game it has happened and so in all
probability it will until the end and
in pretty nearly all cases the action of
the men in the cab has been the same
sure swift and quick they have done
all in the power of man to check the
speed of their train their thoughts
have been only of the passengers who
sleeping through the watches of the
night trust their lives with the men on
the engine

  many times quicker than it can be

related dave marion closed the throt-
tle swung the handle of the brake
valve away around into full emergency
application snapped the independent
brake to the right as far as it would
go opened both sander valves and
pulled the big reverse lever into the
back motion then he had done all in
his power and the fate of number
three was in the hands of a higher
being

  billy he called to the fireman
jump boy were into them

  an instant later the fireman disap-
peared from the gangway out into the
night and dave marion with one
foot against the boiler butt braced back
in his seat to wait

ii

  because the limited had been re-
ported thirty minutes fate to gain time
for the live-stock train the helper had
been ordered to cross to the second iron
and couple on ahead of the freight that
there might be no delay after the pass-
ing of number three

  protected by the fixed signal which
was set at danger there would have
been no wreck that night had the engi-
neer watched for the signal himself but
he had trusted his fireman and billy
parker whose eyes fresh from before
the dazzling glare of the fire played
him a grim prank thought he saw white
at the masthead when instead it was
red and then a moment afterward
all too late he saw his error

  only two men were killed in the
crash at helper one was the flagman
who had been riding on the pilot of the
helper engine dazed and held by that
strange horrible charm which grips
people in times of sudden danger and
holds them incapable of the action
which wul save theni he had been
caught between the two engines

  the other man was george maynard
the engineer in the cab of the helper
a mountain division man



locomotive he was betty maynards
father

  but though he himself was not even
badly hurt the tortures which gripped
dave marions soul were a thousand-
fold more than death in all of its grim
horrors could have been

  the cold merciless fact that he was
responsible that his engine had killed
that he had caused the death of two
men was a savage tragedy that tore
the heart from the man the fact that
through his own quick action not a
passenger on his train received so much
as a scratch did not lessen the torment
that raged within him

  during nine years on the right side
of a locomotive cab his engine had
never before killed a man it had been
a record of which he had felt justly
proud and then-then came the night
at helper and betty maynards father
was one of his first victims

  dave marion didnt blame his fire-
man  he was too big a man for that
he was strong enough to face his own
errors of omission and commission he
realized that the sudden change from
the glaring firelight to the inky black-
ness of the night had probably been
the cause of billy parkers calling the
signal wrong

  there was no coroners inquest after-
ward out there there was no arrest
there was no manslaughter charge
they took dave marions engine away
from him that was all they set him
back firing

  and dave marion was not a quitter
in all probability he would have gone
back to the left side without a murmur
he would have taken it as part of the
game but for one thing

  it wasnt the ruling of the powers
that proved the biggest blow-the blow
that broke him it was not the loss of
his engine it wasnt that it was the
girl-betty maynard

  she was the court-the judge the
jury and the executioner she it was

who rendered the final judgment on
dave marion it was her verdict that
broke him

  hers must have been a terrible grief
else she would never have turned him
away as she did it must have been a
frantic passion that blinded her love for
the man

  perhaps if he had waited perhaps
if he had not taken the task of death
messenger upon himself if he had
waited only a little while it might have
been different but in his heart he
had felt that she would need him the
most in the hour of her sorrow

  it was in the cold gray hours of the
dawn whenhe broke the news to her
he told her as gently as he could and
he did not spare himself

  at first it had seemed as though it
was more than she could comprehend
then her mind slowly cleared there
had been a collision-her father was
dead-dave marion had been at the
throttle of the engine which had taken

his life-

  in the throes of a grief which was
beyond emotional expression betty
maynard faced the engineer-the man
she loved her clear gray eyes were
tearless her voice was ominously
calm and low but it cut like the savage
lash of a whip as she hurled her accu-
sation at him

  you the words came slowly de-
liberately slow each sentence piercing
him like a blade of cold steel you
killed my father you a railroad man
ran your signal you in the cab of the
empire limited you admit your
blame youre a murderer

  and then with a dry sob she gave
away to the wild grief that surged with-
in her

  as dave marion listened to the girl
father time resting a long mythical
finger on the engineer suddenly trans-
formed the confident clear-eyed steel-
nerved man who so short a time before
had been the absolute master of a great


new story magazine

swaying snorting mass of iron and
steel at the head of the empire limited
into a man quickly grown old a man
whose face showed haggard and gray
in the early light of morning a man
wlose eyes had lost their brightness
in a scant five minutes he had aged
years slowly he turned away turned
and went out into the crisp dew-
touched air of a new day without a
word he left her for there was nothing
he could say

iii

  while the humiliation caused by the
loss of his engine the loss of the trust
that had been placed in him was great
the railroad blood vas strong in his
veins and dave marion would proba-
bly have soon regained that which he
had lost on the division but for the
woman

  his love of the pulsating life of the
rail was strong but his love for her
was stronger and when in the moment
of sudden grief her love had turned
against him with all of the vehement
passion which kipling has accredited
the female of the species it turned the
man against himself and all of his kind

  while betty maynard in the sudden-
denness of her wild fury killed the
good in the engineer she also aroused
all the evil-the demon in him he
became a great snarling snapping brute
-a frequenter of the filthy drinking
gambling hell holes in castle rock
even the drunken brawling gutter
wrecks became his associates men
came to fear and hate him a month
later he disappeared

  he sulked in solitary places he
caroused in the reeking rum-soaked at-
mosphere of the underworld of west-
ern cities he drifted up and down the
pacific coast san francisco portland
seattle-all were visited by the man
that had been

  like a water-soaked piece of drift-

wood driven aimlessly about by wind
and tide dave marion wandered from
city to city he rode the blind he rode
the rods he decked the overland trains
and in these rovings the bitterness in
his soul ever increased

  and the woman  she in the sudden
loneliness of her life mourned the loss
of her father-and her lover and in
penitence she suffered through the
long weary days of terrible emptiness
which filled her life alone with her
love and her regret

  it was a clear autumn night a year
and four months after dave marion
ran his signal at helper a long shad-
owy freight extra was noisily pounding
its winding way down the west slope
of the rockies east of summit spur

  at seventeen minutes of twelve
oclock with many shrill protestations
from gripping brake shoes and many
bumping jolts of drawbars it came to
a stop just below the station at river-
ton

  a grimy engineer in the cab of the
big freight puller at the head carefully
consulted his watch in the yellow light
which shone through the partly open
fire door

  we cant make black canon siding
ahead of number six he called down
to an equally grimy figure who lan-
tern in hand was waiting expectantly
on the low step below the cab shes
due here in twenty minutes wed better
pull in

  a moment later a switch lamp twin-
kling in the shadows changed from
white to red a lantern was raised and
lowered in a go-ahead motion there
was a hiss of air in the cylinders back
along the train a rattle of couplings as
the brakes released the slack ran up
on the engine and extra  in a
long weaving line of many-shaped
freight cars headed into the second
a mountain division man



siding at riverton to await the passing
of the oriental limited-number six

  as the tail lights shimmering dots of
red at the rear of the extra passed over
the siding switch and the train straight-
ened itself on the passing track another
overall-uniformed toiler of the rail
swung to the ground closed the switch
locked it and hurried back to where the
freight was slowing to a stop well in
the clear he turned the markers so
that they showed green to the rear and
side removed the red platform lanterns
and disappeared through the door of
the caboose

  wearied by many long hours on duty
many miles of halting laborious prog-
ress on the heavy grades of the west
slope many meetings and passings of
schedule trains the eyes of the extras
crew in engine and caboose were
quickly closed in sleep

  only the slow spasmodic breathing
of the pumps on the engine and an oc-
casional hiss of escaping air from a
faulty train-pipe connector broke the
stillness

  far above rugged snow-capped
crags and needlelike spires glistened in
the moonlight the scenic grandeur of
night in the rockies became enhanced a
hundredfold as a great yellow moon
creeping high in the heavens threw its
rays far down into the shadows of the
mouptains

  at midnight away above and to the
westward a flash of brightness from a
locomotives powerful headlight re-
vealed the coming of number six
sweeping around the long s curve like
a great weird serpent she rushed down
toward riverton

  at three minutes past twelve she
thundered past the station-on time to
the dot

  a sleepy operator dozing with head
close to the sounder of his train wire
drowsily opened his key and osd-
reported her by-and then immediately
resumed his slumbers

  with a momentary pinching grind
of brakes in hurried deference to
switches with a purring plume of
steam which hummed from her engines
dome with a dull reverberant roar that
came with the clash of the closeness of
her passing the first section of the
oriental limited rolled swiftly by the
silent freight and its slumbering crew

  but mingling with and muffled by
the noisy rumble of her going there
came a long droning wail from her
whistle immediately followed by two
quick sharp notes-a long and two
short

  their senses numbed by sleep the
crew of extra  heard the last
sucking rush of air and glimpsed the
two twinkling dots of red that marked
the passing of first number six but
neither enginemen or trainmen in their
sudden awakening caught the whistle
signal which had been sounded by the
limited

  a long and two short to call the
attention of yard engines extra trains
or trains of the same or inferior class
or inferior right to signals displayed
for a following section such is the
designation as applied to rules which
govern a single track

  and while the first section of the
oriental limited was fast vanishing in
the night the extra was preparing to
follow her down through the black
canon of the rio chelan for no man
of the freight trains crew had heard
the warning note of the whistle which
told of the second section to follow

  the engineer and conductor of the
extra glancing at their watches knew
that it had been the passing of the lim-
ited that had aroused them but that
was all

  a lantern swung over and back as a
brakeman flashed a high ball a
switch lamp showed red and the freight
again resumed an interrupted journey
eastward

  feeling sure of their right to proceed


new story magazine

the crew of extra  did not know
as their train moved out onto the main
line that it was creeping along in the
path of the second section of number
six which in a short ten minutes
would come tearing down upon them
like a hurtling demon of destruction

  only one man knew of the tragedy
which was swiftly forming out there
in the mountains he was a gaunt
hollow-eyed tramp who from back in
the shadows of a grimy gray water
tank had watched the passing of first
number six he had heard the warn-
ing screech of the whistle-had seen
the glittering eyes of green which shone
from the front of the flying engine

  he knew what the ghastly result
would be should the heavy slow-mov-
ing freight rolling carefully down the
steep grade well within its restricted
speed limit be suddenly overtaken in
its going by second number six rush-
ing along on a running schedule which
was marked up close to the margin of
safety

  a ragged wandering wreck of a
man and upon his action hung the
destiny of a trainload of human souls
the fate of men women and children
rested with him-for life or for death

  a straggling ray of moonlight for
an instant fell upon his face the hag-
gard features showed hard and cruel
it was a face that reflected a terrible
bitterness in his heart-the face of a
man who had renounced every particle
of good in his soul he was dave
marion

  there was no thought of passengers
or railroad men in his half-crazed mind
when he caught a low hand iron and
swung himself up between the second
and third car ahead of the caboose

  surging through his brain was only
one idea somewhere in the black
canon of the rio chelan there was
going to be a wreck there was going
to be a crunching grinding crash on
that narrow shelf of rock on which the

track wound great dark human-
freighted coaches would merge their
black shapes with shattered box cars
they would crumple together like
paper and then go toppling into the
black depths far below and he would
be there beneath them he would go
with them

  months of dissipation and sullen
brooding with his bitter thoughts had
made the man a half-demented demon
-a devil

  minutes passed the freight clicked
its crooked way down around the face
of the brown and gray rock walls which
towered hundreds of feet above and
the man still clinging between the clat-
tering cars waited

  as he waited he timed the coming of
that train behind

  down below the needle he mut-
tered half aloud the worst stretch
of iron on the great southern system
-on the whole mountain division
down on the devils whip theyll be
into us all over before theres chance
for- his rambling mutterings sud-
denly ceased a new thought flashed
through his mind what about the
boys who would be at the throttle-
who would be running second number
six 

  he knew what would take place
there in the cab he had been there
he knew the man on the right would
cross the great divide with his hands
still gripping his brake lever there in
the narrow confine beside the great
boiler head dave marion knew it

  nearly ten minutes passed the long
train swung out onto the high trestle
which crosses the rio chelan to the op-
posite wall of the canon in about four
minutes it would come that for which
he waited possibly less

  he leaned out and looked ahead a
yellow-tinged bit of white showed
against the -black wall of rock the
faint pur of the safety valve came to
his ears he glanced above him there
a mountain division man



towering like a great airy spirit the
spire of the needle glistened some two
thousand feet from the canons bot-
tom and then-a strange thing hap-
pened

  something stirred dave marion
perhaps it was the faint yellow-tinged
bit of white which waved above the
s dome perhaps it was the mighty
grandness of the sparkling needles
peak perhaps it was an unseen power
but be that as it may something
aroused him

  deep in his heart there remained one
tiny drop of long-dormant red blood
the blood of the man that had been-
the red blood of the railroad game
and now something had suddenly
aroused it

  it was like a bit of virile life it i
shot through his veins purifying the
sluggish rum-soaked slime that flowed
there as it went he felt the grip and
thrill of the railroad life he thought
of the woman and of her charge
you a railroad man ran your signal
and he a railroad man-a mountain
division man-had planned to let one
of the boys and his great black pet
with its trainload of humanity pile up
in a snarling mass of wreckage there
on the devils whip to slide into the
black waters of the rio chelan a hun-
dred feet below

  once a railroad man always a rail-
road man you cant get away from
it its in the blood and the mouth
of dave marion shut in a thin deter-
mined line

  as swift as had been the coming of
that strange awakening in his heart
just as swift was his action he knew
that every moment meant much his
brain had suddenly seemed to clear he
was fully awake to the fact that every
second had its ugly possibilities-the
coming of second six

  fearing to lose time by going over
the tops of the two cars to the caboose
he chose another course of action

  he swung to a low hand iron between
the moving train and the canon wall
which was so close that it seemed
nearly to side-swipe the cars hanging
with one foot on the step he snapped a
housing box open and diving his hand
into the oily packing pulled forth a
stringy mass of grease-soaked waste

  the next instant he swung low and
dropped the force of the moving
freight hurled him against a sharp rock
and he fell on the very ends of the ties
while the trucks and wheels rattled and
whirred less than a foot from him

  with the passing of the caboose he
staggered to his feet he put one hand
to his head for it felt strangely light
and he was a little dizzy his hat was
gone and his hair was wet and matted
but he thought little about it for the
fingers of his other hand still clutched
the oily waste

  unsteadily he stumbled over the ties
half walking half running he hurried
back toward the trestle

  two red tail lights were disappearing
around one of the treacherous curves
of the whip behind while ahead far
up the canon a bit of light flashed

  dave marion started to cross the
trestle took two or three stops and a
foot dropped between the ties he felt
a numbing pain and when he tried to
straighten up his left leg crumpled
helplessly beneath him he heard a
rumble to the west and he tried to see
but his eyes blurred as a warm sticky
something blinded him

  half stunned and fast losing control
of his senses he was but a dark blotch
between the rails

  he fumbled frantically for a match
it was with difficulty that he finally got
one from his pocket in his haste to
light it it broke and was lost

  he could hear the vibrating click
from the rail growing louder every in-
stant with a desperate effort he
reached for another match he
scratched it on the shining band of steel

beside him but then it fell from his
limp lingers and burned uncertainly
close beside the guard rail

  with painful care he moved the hand
that gripped the oil-soaked packing
over the dying flame then suddenly
it caught a straggling strand of the
greasy thread and ran quickly into the
thicker mass above there was a flick-
ering flash and then a blaze of fiery
brightness

  feeling woefully weak he swung the
burning waste back and forth the
flesh of his hand burned and became
ugly with discoloration but there was
no feeling no pain as he swung the
flaming signal from rail to rail

  to dave marion it seemed minutes
hours ages while he waited in reality
the time could have been counted in
seconds and then there came to him
the most welcome sound man ever
heard-two short sharp blasts of a loco-
motives whistle his signal had been
seen  a clear-eyed engineer had caught
sight of that strange bit of fire which
moved in a stop signal ahead on the
trestle and with his hand quickly
reaching for the whistle cord he sent a
reassuring answer echoing within the
walls of the black canon

  with every wheel of her train in a
mighty grip with wheels locked and
sliding over smoke-rimmed rails with
wheels circled by spitting streaks of
fire with streams of sand spurting from
sander pipes with the powerful mech-
anism of the engine struggling against
the back motion of the reverse with a
gritting crunching thunder second
number six straining against herself
slid onto the trestle and with a last
quivering jar stopped with her pilot
less than ten feet from a strange black
shape that still moved a blackened hand
back and forth

  dave marion was muttering vaguely
when he realized that a flaring kero-
sene torch was being held close to his
face he heard voices and exclama-

tions but they seemed to be at a great
distance he thought he heard his
name something or somebody lifted
him carefully with an effort he tried
to speak but somehow his voice failed
him miserably he tried several times
before he finally forced the discon-
nected words from between his lips

  an-an extra-an-theyre-out-
out-on your-your time he stut-
tered brokenly and fainted

  it was over a week before dave
marions scattered senses had sufficient-
ly returned for him to realize that he
was not still waving a burning piece of
waste in the path of second number
six on the black canon trestle

  he next realized that everything was
wonderfully quiet and peaceful look-
ing back on many black tormenting
months he couldnt remember a single
instance when anything had seemed as
alluring with its restful cleanliness as
the room in which he found himself

  an old longing seized him scarcely
above a whisper he murmured his first
coherent thought as he uttered one
faint word  betty

  it was a magic word like a princess
in a fairy tale for betty suddenly ap-
peared before him she stood looking
down at him

  she leaned over him and stroked his
forehead her touch was cool and re-
freshing she readjusted the bandage
on his head and then kneeling beside
the bed she took his one good hand
between her two strong little palms
dave she said softly lets make our
mistakes our stepping-stones

  there is a distant signal on the curve
at helper now and dave marion
pulls number one west and four east
-the two crack trains of the road

  the blood of the game is strong
within him for he is a mountain di-
vision man-and his wife is a mountain
division woman

confession 

by keene thompson



templeton paced his cell in the
death house it was midnight he
knew that meant five hours more-
only five hours to and fro to and
fro he trapped the narrow confines of
that cage of iron bars and concrete

  it was all over with him this was
the finish templetons face was hag-
gard as he confronted the realization
that he had come to the end of his rope
-the law was going to have its way
with him after all there was nothing
now that could safe him

  five hours left something like a
groan escaped him three hundred
minutes-and already one of them had
gone on the silence the measured
tread of his own footsteps rang loudly
in his ears but what was the matter
with them all his fellow prisoners
caged about him and the guards in the
corridor outside all asleep at a time
like this didnt they know he was
going away that in just a little
space of time a human being was to
die against his will  then it flashed
upon him they were not sleeping out-
side there a score of ears were strain-
ing expectantly to catch the first hint
of his breaking down that was the
true explanation of the silence

  the clasp of his hands behind his
back tightened till the knuckles showed
white he wanted to meet their ex-
pectations to scream out beating the
walls around him-to give way utterly
to the panic he felt rising within him
it seemed that he must cry aloud to

     

some one to come and let him out of
this trap-to stop the machinery of jus-
tice that was inevitably if slowly grind-
ing toward his doom

  a mistake was being made didnt
they know that  couldnt they see it 
unless a halt were called soon now
before it was too late-

  he set his jaws against the impulse
to shatter the nerve-racking silence with
a shrieking out of his inward terror
no no by heaven that temple-
ton iron nerve of which the newspa-
pers had made so much during the
weeks and months of his trial he would
keep to the end that is-as long as
he could hold out as it was a cer-
tainty that ire had to go it might as well
be gamely this he told himself would
be a fitting climax to the fight he had
made

  and yet to die

his brows met was there no way
out still  back over the ground he had
covered a thousand times before his
mind went seeking a single possible
loophole of escape he began with the
day of his arrest his employer the
millionaire whose lawyer he had been
found dead in his chair in the library of
his home there was a small round hole
in his forehead where a thirty-eight
bullet had gone and the police when
they came to search templetons rooms
had found a thirty-eight-caliber revolv-
er there this with the circumstance
that he john templeton had been the
last one seen with the old gentleman on


new story magazine

the night of the latters death had been
sufficient to cause the detectives to lead
him away to jail

  circumstantial evidence-that was ail
it had been with a plea of not
guilty he had entered upon the trial
with every confidence of an acquittal

  and-they had convicted him

  then the real battle had begun in
a signed statement-which the papers
had been only too glad to print-he had
sworn to his innocence again and prom-
ised the public that he would prove the
fact too an appeal had been made for
a new trial after due deliberation the
right had been denied him he had
next appealed to the governor in vain
-and there died his last hope

  and yet a second time he had im-
plored the executive to make a more
thorough investigation of his case he
was innocent-a sifting of all the evi-
dence of the crime with which he was
charged must surely reveal that at best
he ought to be given the benefit of the
doubt which would make only an act of
common justice of another trial on
every oath under high heaven he vowed
himself guiltless-the victim of persecu-
tion and mistrial

  and still the governor had refused to
intervene only that morning-the day
set for his execution-word had come
of that officials flat refusal to interfere
in any way in the matter

  it was the end there was no chance
for templeton left after that-he knew
it surely as the rising of the sun he
was going to be led down that corridor
outside accompanied by two or three
guards and a priest to the little door
which would open and close just once
behind him but oh for a chance a
single ghost of one chance more

  abruptly templeton swung round in
his tracks to face the door of his cell

  the rattle of a key in the lock had
drawn his attention there and now
before his eyes the door swung slowly

  open into the cell stepped a man a
stranger to templeton

  this individuals appearance was de-
cidedly quaint short in stature with
a bulging forehead and a pair of eye-
glasses riding far down on his long
thin nose he bore a striking resem-
blance to the mental picture that is
summoned up whenever one hears of
an aged scientist or student recluse the
mans clothes were ordinary-indeed
shabby on the closer inspection which
templeton gave to this odd visitor

  but if the latter was aware of the
existence of this cells occupant he
gave no sign of it as he moved across
the tiny apartment to the iron cot and
silently seated himself

  still utterly ignoring templeton
from an innei-pocket of his threadbare
coat the little man drew a packet of
papers taped and sealed these he
proceeded to arrange on top of the cot
beside him with businesslike precision

  then for the first time he looked
sharply up over the rims of his glasses
at templeton

  your name said the stranger curt-
ly is john templeton

  how this man had been able to get
in here at a time like this when all
communication with the outside world
was denied him templeton did not stop
to question his heart was beating
wildly-yes with a sudden hope

  that is correct he replied to the
others question

  member of the new york bar
went on the little man snapping out the
words late of two hundred nassau
street adviser in the legal affairs of
the late john c price millionaire cot-
ton broker murdered on the night of
the twenty-fourth of august last

  templeton steadied himself by draw-
ing in a deep breath

  i am the man he said simply

  placed under arrest-here the vis-
itor paused for the fraction of a min-
ute while he consulted one of the
confession 



spread-out papers beside him-on sep-
tember second charged with the willful
homicide of the aforesaid price your
employer and convicted eight months
later to a day appeal for retrial de-
nied date of execution set for the
week that began two days ago-
templeton leaned forward

  i am the man he repeated tensely
and now your business

  the caller leaned back he cradled
one knee in his clasped hands

  and to-day you die he said matter-
of-factly at sunrise which is less
than five hours away

  templeton swallowed audibly over
the rising lump in his throat his
hands were working at his sides

  are you ready to die john temple-
ton  asked the little man bluntly do
you want to die

  to the last question the answer came
decisively

  no

  the stranger nodded then i was
right he said i thought you might
be glad to see me and i guess you
are for i have come-to set you
free

  he leveled a long angular forefinger
at templeton who stood speechless and
gaping before him

  john templeton he went on im-
pressively in five hours you are going
to die you know as well as i that
you stand not the remotest chance of
escaping the chair down the hall out-
side there you are done for-to speak
frankly well what would you say if
i should tell you that there is still one
way in which you can get off

  then it was true now the beating
of bis heart all but shut off templetons
breath a way had been found at last
some new point of evidence had turned
up and this man had discovered it he
had come to get him off but was he
dreaming no it was true that was
what the man himself had just said
for gods sake tell me blurted the

prisoner what is it a new suspect
found by the police to make another
trial of the case necessary ob epeak

  seriously the little man shook his
head

  nothing like that he said
  templeton fairly panted

  then a pardonfrom the governor

lies changed his mind-

  you are wrong put in the other
you are on the wrong track altogether

i will explain no one-nothing-on
the outside has anything to do with
your getting off that rests entirely
with you do you understand the
means of gaining your freedom is in
your own hands now perhaps you
know what i mean

  a moment templeton stared down at
the odd figure before him undecided
whether to doubt his callers sanity or
his own

  no lie said dully i dont-dont
follow you

  its like this the other went on
you do not want to die you say you
want to leave here free your own man

i tell you it is all up to you whether
you do so or not you have only to
do one thing-that is all

  templeton drew himself up

  one thing he repeated what is
it-dont keep me in suspense what
have i got to do 

 the stranger regarded him in silence
over the rims of his glasses for a mo-
ment or two

  tell me the truth he replied
templeton bowed quietly he stood-
at attention

  are you guilty of this crime asked
the little man or innocent

  i am innocent templeton an-
swered

  the caller leaned back taking his
knee in his hands once more

  you understand that you are stand-
ing in the shadow of death he re-
marked that this is no time to palter

with the truth and now once more
-the truth itself this time

  i tell you cried templeton that
i am innocent-innocent

  the little man was looking him
through and through with his sharp
light-blue eyes

  you didnt murder the old gentle-
man he said slowly you werent
after the legacy he had put you down
for in his will as was afterward
brought out at the trial you didnt
want his money not at the price of
an employer and benefactors life
templetons teeth could be heard
grinding as he held himself in

  i tell you again he grated i am
innocent

  once more there was a pause

  ill give you one more chance an-
nounced the stranger on the edge of
the cot for your life-tell me the
truth now which is it guilty or
innocent  remember-this is your last
chance

  beads of perspiration were rolling
down templetons face his lips
twitched into his eyes had crept a
hunted look akin to the light of mad-
ness as he hesitated before his in-
quisitor

  then he burst forth 

  in pitys name put an end to this
i am innocent-innocent would i lie
at a time like this  do you think i am
a fool i take you at your word you
say you can set me free if i tell you
the truth and i have told it to you-
three times what more can i do than
that i never killed him i am guilt-
less as you are yourself i swear it
he gasped for breath now get me
out of here and quick before i go
stark mad time is slipping by theres
not too much of it to spare as it is
how do you get me off

  but the little man gathering up his
papers from the cot had risen prepar-
ing to depart

  i thought he said stopping to

throw another one of his piercing
glances at templetons face that i
might be of service to you i see now
that i was wrong unless- he hes-
itated if i asked you again would
you tell me the truth this time
under the strain templetons over-
strung nerves at last gave way

  innocent you hear he shouted
thats what i swear-ill stick to it
innocent innocent

  and then the little man began to
laugh silently mockingly as he stood
before the condemned man he shook
from head to foot with his inward
mirth staring at him abruptly tem-
pleton threw up his arms against the
stone wall burying his face on his
sleeves

  all a trick he groaned there
is no hope it was all done just to

mock me oh the cruelty-

  there was the sound behind him of
the iron door opening he wheeled
quickly to find that he stood alone in
the cell the queer little man had van-
ished as though the floor had opened
to swallow him

  a guard stood on the threshold
were ready for you he said sim-
ply

  beyond the turnkey in the corridor
showed the first gray of the coming
dawn templetons time was up-and
his visitor the man who had come to
save him staring wildly round him
suddenly the prisoner fell upon his
knees he stretched out his hands past
the waiting guard in the doorway

  come back he cried ill tell you
the truth-i did it his voice rose to
a shriek i am guilty come back
for gods sake-come back and save

me from this im guilty guilty-

  he raved  his mind broken down
from the strain of protesting his false
innocence all through the months that
had followed his arrest had now given
completely away babbling half inco-
herently he knelt there appealing to
confession 



the strange little man-who had never
existed outside of his shattered imag-
ination the phantom conjured up in
his overburdened brain before its final
snapping

  the guard was used to seeing them
take it hard at the end he stepped
back into the corridor and beckoning

to two of his fellows brought them into
the cell they dragged templeton to
his feet by main strength

 and so they led him awav down the
shadowy hall his cries growing fainter
and fainter until at last the little door
at the corridors end closed noiselessly
behind him

if one law dont get a man that sins
another will said hinman that
aint original with me the minister
my brother-in-law sprung it on me
when i told him the story of bad jim
henderson im going to give you
jims story and you can figure it out
for yourself better than i could very
likely

  spring had come again to hinmans
farm on which he was spending the
peaceful days of his middle age leaf
and vine had stirred to a living green
the crops were planted the air was
soft on this sunday morning and the
sunshine was like wine the old earth
had been reborn and the miracle was
no less wonderful because it had been
wrought so many times before

  we sat on hinmans front porch
after breakfast he had mused for a
space before he had spoken

  there used to be a law in the lumber
woods that no man should ever squeal
he went on the law obtained from
the foreman down often a sheriff
would come to camp looking for some

bad man the foreman would take
him to his shack and let him look over
the pay roll that was always a bluff
for offenders never give their real
names when they stick the foreman for
a job if the foreman thought he had
the man the sheriff was lookin for but
under another name hed never peep
it was the sheriffs business to find his
man not the foremans business to lead
the sheriff to him

  the law of the books has been
cheated many a time because a fore-
man and the jacks kept still when a
sheriff tried to pump em a man got
this protection so long as he didnt lie
or steal or kill in camp that was
the other angle of the law youll see
how bad jim transgressed and what
came of it

  toward the fag end of september
a lumber camp is ready for business
the contractor has named his foreman
and the foreman has gone up into the
woods and got his set of camps put up
and has hired his crew sometimes
they cut all through the winter if the

the l w

- of the 

woods

snow isnt heavy but in the old days
it wasnt often they didnt have to stop
on account of the heavy fall

  about the time snow flies the camp
is pretty much set in its ways the
work is bein rushed and the men have
got each other sized up had their fights
and made their friendships anybody
driftin into camp after things is run-
nin smooth is naturally a person of
some interest

  i spent one winter after i was mar-
ried in the woods of the lower penin-
sula that winter we had three such
interestin events first come a man
who called himself bob hart the
foreman give him a job handlin a cant
hook on the skids he was green and
as usual the foreman took him in hand
very patient and showed him how to
handle his hook he was a big strong
man and pretty soon he could do his
work as well as the next for a while
he was an object of interest but he was
a silent man never speakin unless he
was spoken to and sometimes not then
he seemed to want to be left alone

  we noticed one peculiar thing
about him though he seemed to take
a real likin to the foreman evidently
he had expected to be cussed when he
showed he was a green hand i noticed
when he first come that he had a hard
bad eye but i saw him watchin the
foreman many times and that look was
gone entirely he was like a great
shaggy dog thats ready to lick its mas-
ters hand

  well by the time the camp had as-
similated him and he didnt create no
more interest than anybody else along
comes another stranger he was a big
man too and like the first man he
didnt know nothin about handlin logs
but seems he had been used to horses
and the foreman put him in charge of
a team haulin logs it is some task to
handle a team on the icy roads theyre
like glass after the sprinklin carts has
passed over them in the night and the

water has froze on them but this man
could make the horses put their stom-
achs to the ground and pull together
that was sufficient

  after a bit the camp took this man
in too and then the third man come
he also measured up big among big
men they was a good deal alike in
stature-those three and since it was
a day when men wore beards-especial-
ly that worked out of doors the way
the jacks did-there wasnt an uncom-
mon difference in their appearances

  the second and the third man be-
come pals almost off the bat they
didnt pay any attention to the first
man though the first one and the third
one worked side by side with cant hooks
on the log piles

  well you cant fool a jack much
about an officer of the law and pretty
soon there was whisperin in the bunk
houses nights after the days work was
done the second man-dan holmes
he called himself-was picked to be a
sheriff if he was a sheriff the men
knew mighty well that he was after
somebody and since nobody ever asked
questions about any of the others they
didnt know what any man had done in
the past

  but one thing was sure-an officer
was not welcome among them not
that they would harbor a criminal or
condone a crime quickern anybody
else but it was the law that nobody
squealed and an officer was looked
on as a man who would like to have
somebody squeal to him

  what comes now i got from the
foreman later he had come over to
the bunk house and had ordered the
crew to turn in it was the rule that
all noise should cease when he give
that order the men had to have their
proper rest to do the work required of
them

  the men began to turn their wet
socks and shirts on the wires before
the big stove and then they began to
the law of

amble off to their bunks all but the
man callin himself holmes he walked
to the door behind the foreman

   like to speak with you a minute
he says

   come over to the office says the
foreman none too politely for he hadnt
been deaf to the whisperin that had
been goin on

  they went over to the office and
sat down

   got a man here named jim hen-
derson holmes asked known over
the canadian line as bad jim hender-
son wanted in montreal on a charge
of robbery been smugglin some too
from sarnia down to hamilton

  the foreman opened his desk and
took out a pay roll he held it out to
holmes holmes shoved it aside with
a laugh

   henderson wouldnt be givin you
his own name he said whos this
fellow callin himself gibbons

   you ought to know more about
him than i do says the foreman you
been his pal since youve been here
gibbons was the third man whod
come to camp after the season had be-
gun the foreman could see now why
holmes had played up to him

   well says holmes i think gib-
bons is bad jim henderson i got a
warrant for his arrest-a canadian
warrant i have no extradition papers
though i was wonderin if you would
give me a hand to help me get him over
to canada

  the foreman rolled the pay roll up
in his hands and then unrolled it he
let his eyes wander along the tarred
paper that made the roof of his office

   im runnin a lumber camp mis-
ter he said at last tin not an as-
sistant sheriff if the man is here why
you can just tote him away with you-
if you can

   suppose says holmes that i
deputize you in the name of the law

   and suppose the foreman comes

the woods	

 back that i bang you over the head
 with a club that has the stars and
 stripes nailed to one end of it sup-
 pose also that i tie a can to yon and
 whisper to the boys that your absence
 will be more desirable than your pres-
 ence it has been dull in camp maybe
 a little devilment wouldnt go amiss
 with the boys understand

   holmes sized the foreman up for a
 spell then he grinned a little i guess
 he thought he might as well grin and
 bear it

     well he said we may as well for-
  get this little talk you wont tell any-
  body what ive told you 

     im gettin out logs-or tryin to
 said the foreman i have no time to
 carry tales

    holmes went back to the bunk house
 the foreman started to get ready for
 bed dismissin the matter from his
 mind then he heard a rappin on his
 shutter he goes to the door and looks
 out a man is crouched beneath the
 window

   what do you want the foreman
 asked

    the man stood up bending a little
 at the waist and starin first over one
 shoulder and then over the other

     i want to see you says the man

     why in hell dont you come to the
 door then  says the foreman who was
 gettin out of temper with his visitors
 in the night come in

   the man goes in it was him who
 called himself bob hart he was in
 the foremans office for ten minutes
 then he come back to the bunk house
 id seen him sneak out after holmes
 and i watched for him to come back
 after holmes returned when he
 -passed my bunk i was struck by the
 look on his face if a big whiskered
 tough-lookin guy was ever near cryin
 bob hart was that night some more
 about him in a minute

    well things goes along without in-
 cident till it got time to send men down


new story magazine

to the banking grounds to get the logs
started down the river to the mills
that was before the time of handling
logs by railroad and the logs used to
be piled twenty feet high on the river
slopes then when the ice went out
they would be made into rafts in the
river and sent down to some lake port
where there was a mill

  about the first of march spring
seemed to have busted the earth wide
open on such a day as this almost
we were all on the banks of the black
river waitin to put the logs in to send
em down to port huron where there
was a mill on the st clair river just at
the mouth of the black river but
the night after we got there the weath-
er man pulled off a stunt that was not
uncommon in those days he sent a
real old-fashioned michigan blizzard
sweepin down on us it began with an
icy rain about sundown and in an hour
the air was thick with snow then this
blew out and a freeze started the
world went like iron under the starlit
sky by morning the river had started
to freeze and in five days the ice was
three feet thick

  well there was nothin the men
could do and the foreman had his
hands full for they all had money corn-
in port huron was not far away
and in those days there was many in-
vitin places along old butler street
the men had pictures of the inside of
a saloon with a fire roarin in the big
stove and plenty of booze and hot water
 tap the result wras feverish stom-
achs and cold skins but the foreman
went among em and got em lined up
in fairly good order

  in the meantime the boys had been
interestin themselves and killin time
by watchin the man who called him-
self holmes they were more than
ever convinced that holmes was an
officer because he began to seem to
want to get away he had not men-
tioned his wages to the foreman either

  on the night of the sixth day the
foreman routed me out of bed i
judged it was about ten oclock

   get dressed he says and come
outside quietly

  in a few minutes i joined him my
but it was cold even the stars seemed
to be froze the way they glittered the
earth rang beneath a mans feet the
river lay still below us black where
there was no snow on the ice and white
where there was nobody was stirrin
and everything was very still the
lights of the nearest town made a frosty
glow in the sky

   there is somethin doin between
this man gibbons and this man
holmes said the foreman i want to
see what theyre up to i havent any
idea of pittin myself against them
alone and i want you to go along with
me i guess youll keep up your end
youre husky enough-i gave my word
to a man a while back that i would help
him out if he got into a hole i guess
i was a chump for doin it but i got to
keep my word these two are plan-
nin something against him i think
step back here into the shadow

  we crept away from the bank and
stood waitin for somethin to happen-
what i didnt know there was no
wind but the icy air ate into a mans
insides i had to clamp my teeth shut
to keep em from chatterin

   holmes and gibbons are goin up
the river and across the st clair to
sarnia said the foreman in a whisper
holmes said he wanted to smuggle a
suit of clothes over on the ice thats
bunk i know holmes dont have to
smuggle a suit of clothes to save five or
ten dollars hes some kind of a ca-
nuck officer hes layin for one of
the men in camp the man aint gib-
bons he and gibbons have been pals
and i dont see what he wants to get
gibbons out of the way for

  we had been standing by a bank of
logs twenty feet high we was dressed
the law of the woods



in dark clothes with our caps pulled
down over our faces when gibbons
and holmes passed us on their way to
the river they werent ten feet from
us but they didnt see us they slid
down the bank to the river and started
toward port huron we followed
keeping a respectable distance between
us

   is the st clair frozen sos they
can get over i asked the foreman

   so holmes says the foreman re-
plied a lot of big ice came down
from lake huron when the thaw was
on and it choked and jammed and then
froze solid ive seen teams go over
when it wasnt any colder than this

  it was three oclock in the morning
when we drew toward port huron we
passed under the two footbridges and
came to the railroad bridge just where
black river empties into st clair the
two men climbed up on the abutment
of this bridge and started along the
track

   mebbe theyve changed their
minds said the foreman well fol-
low them

   moren likely theyve gone to get
a drink i said

  we kept them in sight till they came
to butler street then they turned off
the track by the time we got to where
we could look down the street they
had disappeared

   theres a saloon a few steps up
here said the foreman well have a
look

  we came to a hallway with a light
burnin dimly at the far end of it we
went down this hallway and come to
a door there was a shade on the door
but it was only half drawn we looked
inside holmes and gibbons was
standin at the bar havin a beer apiece

   come on says the foreman

  we returned to the street crossed
over and stood in the doorway of a
building

   i dont quite get this the foreman

said each of those fellows has a
gun on his hip i cant figure what
theyre up to

  pretty soon holmes and gibbons
came out they started for the river
as they passed under a light i saw
each man feel stealthily for his hip
pocket

  we edged along in the shadow of
the buildings till we came to the butler
street dock holmes and gibbons was
standin there lookin down at the ice
we stood in the lee of the passenger-
boat building

   its solid all right holmes said
are you game to go over 

   i wouldnt back out for anything
said gibbons and we could hear him
snigger

  they let themselves down on the
ice and started for the lights of sarnia
a mile away

   come on said the foreman

  we dropped down to the ice quickly
keepin our eyes on the two men but
they had put their faces into the wind
and were plodding along only thinkin
of reaching the other side

   keep below em said the fore-
man the wind is from the head of
the river and if they look around theyll
come into the wind no danger of
their seein us that way

  that wasnt exactly the kind of
walk a man would take to get an appe-
tite for breakfast as the foreman said
the wind was coinin down from the
head of the river and out where there
was nothing to stop it it was strong
enough the going was fierce too
great blocks of ice from lake huron
had crowded against each other and
upended and frozen solid we had
to climb over those that we couldnt
crawl around holmes and gibbons
kept steadily on ahead of us i couldnt
help but feel admiration for em for
the way they kept at it

  pretty soon the dock on the sarnia
side showed black against the white and


new story magazine

blue of the frozen river holmes and
gibbons climbed up on it we slunk
down the river a quarter of a mile and
got up on the dock there

   if theyre as cold as i am theyll
beat it for the first saloon said the
foreman its about half past five and
everything will be open by now

  we climbed the hill and came face
to face with a saloon the foreman
looked it over a bit

   i been in most of these places
he said let me see yes thats the
one there are two back rooms
holmes and gibbons are in the last
room or else in the bar us for the
first room

  we entered a side door and came
upon a hallway like the one in the
port huron place we crept down the
hall and came to the open door of a
little room as we sat down we could
hear voices beyond the thin partition
the foreman touched a bell and a
porter came we ordered something
soft to drink and sat and waited

  holmes and gibbons had been talkin
commonplaces stopping now and then
apparently to sip at their ale then
all of a sudden a chair scraped like
a man was gettin up in a hurry gib-
bons voice came to us through the par-
tition 

   what in hell are you tryin to pull
off henderson

  then holmes voice strident and
quick

  henderson eh well bad jim

i guess ive got you just keep your
hands up if you please	v

  the foreman jumped up

   well go in there he says this
is too rich

  i was at his heels as he got to the
door of the other room there was
gibbons with his back to the wall and
his hands above his head holmes had
him covered with a big gun it was
as pretty a stick-up as ever you see

  both men turned their eyes on us
as we stood in the doorway

   mornin men says the foreman
sarcastic havin a little gun play

   put your gun on this man gib-
bons yells hes bad jim henderson
the carnick smuggler and thief wanted
at montreal

   dont you let him put anything
over on you said holmes quietly but
with a dangerous look in his eyes
hes henderson himself you know

i spoke to you about henderson in
your office foreman this is the man
i was referrin to you wouldnt help
me out that night now keep your
hands off ive got him where i want
him-on canadian soil you he said
to gibbons take off your coat and pull
down the collar of your shirt i want
to see what kjnd of a tattoo mark you
got on you

  gibbons stared at him as if he
thought he had gone crazy

   i aint got any tattoo mark you
damn fool he said

   show me said holmes grimly

  gibbons peeled down to the skin
it was as bare of a tattoo mark as
yours is

  holmes dropped his gun hand his
mouth and eyes wide open gibbons
made as if to put on his coat but in-
stead he pulled his own gun with a
move as quick as a flash of lightning

   now just throw up your hands he
said

  holmes couldnt do nothin but
obey he seemed to think it was use-
less to appeal to the foreman and me

   lets see your own markins says
gibbons

  holmes peeled down just as gib-
bons had done he hadnt a mark on
him neither then the two of them
stood and stared at each other

   ill be cussed said holmes what
kind of a sucker am i ive spent
the best part of a winter playin up
the law of the woods



to you thinkin you was bad jim hen-
derson who are you

   graham is my name said the man
who called himself gibbons im from
police headquarters at detroit who
might you be

   oh said holmes bitterly my
name is clarkson im connected with
the police department in montreal

   you were after that two thousand
they offered for henderson dead or
alive eh so was i ill buy you a
drink will you join us gentlemen
half an hour later graham and
clarkson took a train for windsor
the foreman and i set out across the
ice for the american side the two
policemen had decided that it was too
late in the season to take up their search
again they had told us how they had
hunted bad jim all through the mich-
igan woods when they met up each
saw that the other was not a lumber-
jack their beards which they had
let grow pretty near covered their faces
and they measured up to the general
descriptions of bad jim so they be-
come pals each thinkin he had landed
his quarry

   i knew neither of them was bad
jim said the foreman as we trudged
along i know bad jim holmes had
been tryin to pump me off and on and
last night i hinted i wouldnt be sur-
prised if gibbons was his man holmes
had told me about the tattoo marks
and i see gibbons washin up a short
time ago i knew it would do no harm
for holmes to nab him i wanted to
see what would happen i was lookin
for a double cross of some kind for
bad jim them policemen is clever
the sun is cornin up red shouldnt
wonder if we got a thaw 

  hinman paused to light his pipe he
gazed out at the fields beyond the fence
which bordered the road

  the thaw came he went on in
a few days the weather was a good

deal like this again we got our logs
down and were paid off it was dark
when we finished and most of us de-
cided to lay over till mornin and then
light out for wherever we were bound
-some of us to our homes and some
of us to lake ports lookin for jobs on
the boats

  and it was that night that jim hen-
derson got his we had all met up
in a hotel near the main street bridge
there was a good deal of drinkin and
some of the boys was feelin fine

  all evenin bob hart had been wan-
derin around the hotel once or twice
he put his foot on the stairs as if he
was goin to bed but then he wan-
dered to the door or a window and
stood lookin out about closin time
the foreman came over to where i was
sittin

   im of a mind to have a little
scotch whisky-just a little-before i
turn in he said will you join me

   not in the scotch i said ill
have a glass of milk though

  we went into the barroom through
the side door the porter closed it
and locked it after us there were
probably a dozen of the boys in the
room-nobody else

  as the foreman poured out his
scotch there came a rap on the door
the porter drew aside the shade

   its one of your men he said to
the foreman shall  let him in

  the foreman nodded the porter
opened the door and in came bob hart
i knew for a certainty that hart hadnt
had a drink all evenin but he acted
as if he had a fair-sized load on his
face was white his eyes bright and
he seemed unsteady on his pins every-
body noticed it and they stood starin
at him glasses in hand hart put one
hand  the bar rail and looked them
over

   boys he said slowly theys some-
thing i want to tell you-something you


new story magazine

ought to know im bad jim hender-
son 

  well his announcement aroused
only a mild kind of a curiosity the
boys thought he was makiu a little
drunken spiel nobody cared much
whether lie was bad jim henderson or
the old harry himself thats the
way it was among the jacks

   theres somethin more said bad
jim last fall the officers had me
nearly run to earth they had chased
me clear from montreal to buffalo and
along to sarnia i got away from them
and crossed over it was in septem-
ber and i made for the woods i
wandered about a good bit gettin
nothin then i come across the camp
we just broke up he let his eyes
rest  the foreman a minute

   this man was the foreman you
mind that night holmes said he wanted
to speak to him well i went to his
office alter holmes left i told him
who i was i swore i had never stole
and never smuggled a thing in my life
i said the officers had hounded me be-
cause i had been in prison once when
i was a kid i told him i had never
knowed my father or my mother he
was sorry for me-the first man that
had ever been sorry he shook me
by the hand and said he would give
me a chance to be a man he said
he not only wouldnt squeal but hed
keep a lookout for any move toward
me on holmes part he give me my
chance and ive tried to be a man
ive worked and ive cut out the booze
here to-night i been burnin up for
a taste of red licker but i aint took
it thats what this man done for me
but what i told him was bunk

  the foreman started as if he had
been hit in the face by bad jims open
palm the red crept up to his face and
his eyes got hot

   it was bunk bad jim went on
i was a thief an i was a smuggler i
had as good a father and mother as

any man ever had i broke their hearts
i been in jail a hundred times i was
a bad egg but this man showed me
what it meant to be on the level so
i made up my mind i wouldnt go on
handin him the bunk no more and
i made up my mind i would speak
my little picce out where everybody
could hear me

  he turned to the foreman and put
out his hand here before all of them
i want to apologize mr foster he
said you been the truest friend a
man ever had i want to be on the
level with you

  the foreman stood there for a min-
ute lookin bad jim up and down his
face was twisted with loathing or hate
or contempt or something i dont know
what anyway he was good and sore
that bad jim had put it over  him
and then had let the boys see he had
put it over

   so said the foreman and lordy
me his voice was like a rusty file you
been a thief and a smuggler and you
turned liar you took my help after
youd made a monkey of me hey i
wouldnt cared what your past had
been but a liar among honest men-
just to save your dirty hide pah
he looked like he was goin to spit on
jim to hell with you he says and
he turned sprung the lock on the door
and stamped out

  bad jim henderson stood there be-
fore the bar holdin his hand out in
front of him just as he had extended
it to the foreman pretty soon the
hand fell to his side his eyes trav-
eled over the gang they was grinnin
at him like a bunch of devils to them
it was a big joke over bad jims face
came a look i never want to see again
evil and hate welled up in that face
chasin out of it whatever good had
come into it while jim had been keepin
straight as he thought he turned to
the barkeeper
the law of the woods



   licker he said and his voice was
thick

  he spilled a glass full of the stuff
and some of it slopped over on his
tremblin hand as he carried it to his
mouth when he had downed it he
turned away from the bar walked to
the door sprung the lock as the fore-

man had done and paused his eyes
traveled over the men again

   you bunch of rats he says look
out for me if i ever meet up with any
of you

  then he was gone out of the bar-
room out of the hotel and into the
streets

the man
bejel peleejm broke

by arthur preston hankins -

ho organized this bloomin army
     anyway 

  old first sergeant bowman of k
company had lowered his newspaper
and was looking at me over the top of
his steel-bowed glasses

  i clasped my hands back of my head
and settled comfortably in my chair in
k companys orderly room ready to
encourage the old veteran in any direc-
tion his fertile thoughts might wend

  perhaps george washington i
ventured

  couldnt a been george washing-
ton never told a lie cn you imagine
a man who never told a lie actin as a
recruitin officer

  oh i said i dont imagine
washington was ever on actual recruit-
ing service

  sergeant bowmans eyes twinkled
contemplatively dont take it so seri-
ous he advised i was just wonder-
in at what period in the history o this
mans army certain recruits took on
to-day theyre the oldest soldiers in
the service they never retire and
i dont know that it took any stretch-

in o the truth to get em to enlist
either they seem to like soldierin
youre enigmatical to-day ser-
geant i complained to whom do
you refer

  bowman tilted the front legs of his
chair and slid his blue-striped cap to
the back of his bald head

  well he said theres old sergeant
temptation for one and corprl
curiosity prominent among em-
perhaps the fella who carried the de-
scriptive cards and was in command o
the draft-was one whos now known
as sergeant major ego i could name
twenty ill bet if i was to set me mind
to it

  i am acquainted with all these per-
sonages i laughed but do you
know i always imagined they were
civilians

  to prove to you that the last men-
tioned at least has been in the army
for many years bowman returned
well cut out the pilgrims progressin
and dwell for a time on the man bull
pellum broke

bulj pellum was capn of an outfit


new story magazine

i once infested in this mans army bull
pellum was his commonest title but
sometimes they called um breaker
pellum or reformer pellum

  pie was a spare soldierly-lookin
man of middle height his com-
plexion as we say in the army was
black black hair black eyes black
military mustache as stubby as a re-
volver cleaner and dark scowlin face
he had a sour way and a deep slow
bellowin voice and he rolled his eyes
till the whites showed like a bull does
if hed a been offered a dollar a word
for talkin hed a finished in the bread
line

  bull pellums hobby was reformin
incorrigibles a derelict that hed re-
formed was the only man that had a
chance with um a slipshod soldier
bull would just tolerate as a matter o
course and the naturally good sol-
dier was likely to meet the same treat-
ment if he wasnt ignored altogether
but let a man become a guardhouse
bum a drunkard a regular out-and-out
son of a gun and he had a chance
that is if he was willin to let bull re-
form um once reformed and the path
to the heights lay unobstructed before
um

  i guess break is a better term after
all than reform reform has a kind
of a soothin sound pleadin and pa-
tiently pointin out human errors and
tearful and reproachful i never no-
ticed any o these attributes in the way
bull pellum went at an incorrigible
the long and short of it is that to
reach the happy state mentioned the
incorrigible had to be literally scared
into bein good by bull therein lay
bulls content the old ego in um had
been satisfied see it was his hobby

  well to get down to the demon-
stration there came to the company
one day a tone recruit named lewis
cantenwine we were stationed tem-
porarily at the presidio o monterey
down the coast from frisco detailed

there toact as markers and scorers at
the division rifle meet there was a
vacancy in the company and canten-
wine had been sent down from the
frisco recruitin office to fill it he
was pickled to the eyeballs when he
arrived

  i turned um over to the q m ser-
geant and he fixed um up and bein
a good scout put um to bed for the
rest o the day next mornin i had
um in the office

   kid i says just a few prelimi-
nary words before you start on your
career as a doughboy in old bull pel-
lums outfit not that i give a particu-
lar whoop you know but bein first
sergeant o this organization and a man
o considerable look-see in this mans
army i feel called upon to relieve me
chest when i see a new bud about to
expand

  i looked um over he was a good-
lookin kid and had been well dressed
about two weeks before he had savvy
in his face he wasnt a dub

   kid i went on perhaps youre
laborin under a common delusion you
look to me like a man o the seen-bet-
ter-days variety i think too that you
took on because youre broke has me
experience told me the truth

  he nodded and scraped his feet

   it generally does i says it tells
me further that you and this old man
booze got on rather intimate terms
that maybe you lost a good job be-
cause you associated with this person
that maybe you gambled a little that
this and that kept pullin you down till
you threw up the sponge

    im no good to anybody you
says im the scum o the earth ive
reached the bottom no not quite
either theres the army left how
bout that

   you seem to be a mind reader he
says in a low sarcastic voice

   a recruit reader i corrected
ive studied em by thousands
the man bull pellum broke



   so i went on you made the com-
mon mistake o thinkin the army was
the bottom-the dump heap for human
refuse-a place where a derelict would
be welcomed by his kind who had gone
before-the one place where you could
tontinue bein a bum and get a home
and pay for it

   im aware i says that such is
the common belief among many on the
outside but youre a soldier now and
the sooner you forget it the better
learn your mistake before its too late
most recruits whove gone ahead with
that idea are now in alcatraz or leav-
enworth ever hear o those places
they got bars on the windows as thick
as your wrist

  why are you tellin me all this
he flared up who told you i had any
such idea o the army

   kid i says old man experience
told me you got a job in the army
you went to that job stewed to the
gills if youd a got a job at anything
else on earth the last thing youd a
done would be to go to it the first day
drunk but you thought this job didnt
count the army was just pleadin
with booze fighters to come into the
fold perhaps even you thought youd
make a hit with this grand entry well
you didnt go on now and learn
which end of a gun you look into to
see if its loaded and dont forget

  well i was up to me ears in office
ivork about that time redneck wells
me company clerk had been discharged
only a week before hed got tired o
the doughboys and was gonta re-up in
a wagon-soldier outfit back east the
end o the month was close and the
pay rolls and muster rolls were starin
me in the face and there wasnt a
man in the outfit that i could a made
a decent pen pusher out of in the re-
mainder of his enlistment

  so glancin over this recruits de-
scriptive card after hed left the office

i saw a ray o hope in the indication
that his occupation was bookkeeper

  a little later when old bull comes
in to look over the mornin report i
says

   capn this recruit cantenwine is
a bookkeeper i would suggest that the
capn permit me to try um as company
clerk-temporary at least-till the
months end work is off me hands

  i had me doubts about the boy but
i said nothin to the old man about his
failin

   sergeant says bull pellum thats
one o the greatest mistakes to be made
with a recruit put a recruit in the
orderly offee right off the reel before
he knows  soldiers duty and you gen-
erally ruin um he gets the impression
that the armys been just barely strug-
glin along till he arrived he thinks
a company clerk ranks somewhere close
to a brigadier general itll ruin ninety-
nine out of a hundred sergeant

   i agree with you sir i says but
will the capn tell me what were to do
if lieutenant bowles will help me out
perhaps i cn get along

   lieutenant bowles has other mat-
ters to attend to sergeant

  i may say right here for your en-
lightenment that lieutenant bowles
shouldnt a had other matters to at-
tend to it aint generally known i reck-
on that the second lieutenant attached
to an organization is in reality-when
you get down to the fine points o the
blue book-the company clerk hes
supposed to work in the office under
the first sergeant sos he cn learn com-
pany papers in me nineteen years
first sergeantship ive never had a
shavetail under me hope i will have
before i retire

   well then capn i says i have
no further suggestion to offer but
the capn knows im representin the
company at the meet i have hopes o
makin the division team which shall
i neglect sir the shootin or the rolls 


new story magazine

   neglect nothin while youre my
first sergeant bull rumbled

   then shall i-

  run this office you know what
you need dont bother me with trifles
and see that you dont spoil any re-
cruits either

  so when hed gone i sends for can-
tenwine again

   cantenwine i says im gonta
have you detailed as company clerk-
perhaps only temporarily it all de-
pends on you if you make good and
dont get the swell head you cn proba-
bly hold down the job later it may
mean a corprlship then a sergeant-
ship its in the direct line o promo-
tion from the jump many a sergeant
major and noncom staff officer began
as a company clerk but i reckon most
of em could handle old man booze
a word to the wise heres your desk
find a pen to suit you and ill initiate
you into the mysteries

  he gasped a little at first then sat
down with a kind of a smirk o satis-
faction-a kind of an i-told-you-so
grin

   i guess old bull was right i says
to meself this is gonta hurt this kid
but i got the rolls to get out when
theyre off me hands i reckon wed
better put this rookie to soldierin
well i wanta tell you that so far
as work was concerned i never had a
better man in the office he wrote a
beautiful hand in those days type-
writers werent used a great deal in or-
derly offices and a good penman was at
a premium he was the most accurate
man i ever saw seemed like when
once a thing had been pointed out to
that kid he never made an error and
he grasped details in no time some
firm lost a crackajack office man when
this fella got to be a sport

  well i clung right ito um o course
why shouldnt i siftin the situation
right down to facts what did i care

whether this fella could come to right
shoulder arms or not he could tend
to me work for me and i could leave
everything in his hands while i went
out with the gang i was an old sol-
dier and old soldiers must be worked
for by recruits its an unalterable law
in the army i needed cantenwine
and what a man needs its human na-
ture for um to hang on to

  i didnt make the division team i
fired like a devil up to the six-hundred-
yard range then i went all to pieces
me eyes were beginnin to get too old
for the long ranges-see six hundred
used to be me long suit but anyway
i fell down and didnt go with the team
to chicago when the meet was over
the company was ordered back to
straight duty at riley kansas and i
went with um

  says cantenwine to me as him and
me were arrangin our office fixtures in
the new quarters at riley sergeant
he says dye remember the little talk
you give me the next day after i come
to the company 

   i do i says

   well says he how bout it now

   cantenwine i told um youre do-
in fine if youre havin any dealins
with this booze person its in his pri-
vate office im no temprance lecturer
me son i says i occasionally wrastle
with the old party meself but if he
ever gets me on the mat you cn bet the
audience is mighty slim and theres no
duty claimin me thats the point in
this mans army you cn drink all
thats made so long as you cn do a
soldiers duty it may not be a tem-
prance code that will stand the test o
the abstemious multitude but it suits
the army right well

  he hadnt listened closely aftr id
got past what i said about him doin so
fine his eyes were dreamin and look-
in out the window across the parade
ground

   bowman he says finally dye
the man bull pellum broke



spose the old manll make me a corprl
soon 

  it was the rawest question i ever
heard a private ask of a top soldier it
got me goat

   go ask um i snorted

   oh i wouldnt like to do that he
says innocent as a four-year-old but
you might feel um a little on the sub-
ject bowman

  i wonder if you a civilian-i pretty
near said a damned civilian-know
how rank that was it made me so hot
i could hardly find words to bawl um
out because  knew i couldnt make
um see understand is there any-
thing so completely gets your goat as to
have it up to you to band a scathing
rebuke to an upstart and know your
best efforts will slide from um like
water offen a duck

  but i tried it

   kid i says this job will be your
ruination you aint associatiir enough
with the rest o the men i believe that
because this job was handed to you the
second day o your enlistment you think
youre above the rank and file o this
mans army if youd been on a com-
mon footin with the straight-duty men
youd a learned long ago that what
you just said should bring a blush to
the face o the dumbest old roughneck
in the company it looks to me like
common decency would a made you
bite your tongue when you felt those
remarks stealin out the way to be
promoted-and the only decent way-is
to soldier and keep your mouth shut
the other way is by handshakin it
wont work on bull pellum so you cn
discard that kid as the quartermas-
ters teamster said when the mule
kicked um in the belly i dont think
as much of you as i did

   and furthermore i says you quit
hangin about this office when your
works done you sit here all day and
read after this youll get out and as-
sociate with the men why youre no


more an army man than the day you
come

  he didnt retort just laughed low
and sarcastic

  ill fix you i says to meself no
more o this please-dear-capn-make-
me-a-corprl business and i spit
right on the clean floor as if id bit
into an ultra-embalnied chunk o trans-
port beef

  to bull pellum that afternoon i
says capll the capn was right in
regard to recruit cantenwines bein
detailed as company clerk cantenwine
aint makin a soldier very fast sir
but hes the best man i ever had in an
orderly office me suggestion is that
he be made to do regular duty along
with his office work when the office
work gets heavy the capn cn have
um excused but ill see that this dont
occur too frequently

   go ahead says bull he didnt
add i told you so but be rolled his
black eyes till the whites showed and
that was his bullish way o lettin it be
known that be fplt like it

  late that afternoon  come in the
office and found our clerical prodigy
seated with his feet on me desk read-
in a book as usual

 cantenwine i says go and polish
your shoes and put on your berlin
gloves and be ready to stand retreat
down come the front legs of his
chair stand retreat

   stand retreat i repeated and
to-morrow mornin youll stand reveille
after breakfast youll help the com-
pany police up about the quarters
after that fix up your bunk for daily
inspection ill have something for you
to do in the office then till drill after

drill-

  after drill

   after drill i goes on serenely
come in the office till mess call in
the afternoon from one to two youll

drill again then-

   but sergeant


new story magazine

   yes

   why-why what does this mean
it means that bull pellum has de-
cided to make a soldier outa you can-
tenwine

   and i must do this every day 

   with the addition o kitchen police
and room orderly and guard duty when
it comes your turn but guard wont
begin o course till youve been turned
for duty

  his jaw dropped he blew out his
breath why sergeant he says this
is fierce ive gotta do regular duty
and act as company clerk while im rest-
in-and all on privates pay ill see

you da-

  stop say that and ill lam you
in the mill cantenwine its about time
you were learnin that a noncommis-
sioned officer is not to be seen damned
by a recruit ive let you grow too fa-
miliar i see that youve got the swell
head now im gonta take it outa you
if you make good all right if not-
well then its up to you

   dont get sore now bowman he
says i beg your pardon im sure
but darn the luck what does old pel-
lum mean this is fierce why i
companys clerk is a sergeant he
doesnt do a thing but office work

   he was soldiern for twelve years
before he went into the office i re-
marked hes got his soft job because
he earned it

   now looky here cantenwine i
went on nobodys got anything against
you neither the old man nor me
your records clear im free to say
youre the best clerk i ever had in me
office this double duty aint gonta
kill you in fact its gonta make more
work for me get out and learn to be
a soldier youre anxious for promo-
tion suppose you were promoted to
a corprlship then had to do straight
duty for some reason or other youd
be a laughingstock now i tell you
you got the chance of a lifetime to go

as high as you like youre educated
you cn make a commission even but
first and above all you must be a sol-
dier now you got just about time to
shine your shoes for retreat

  he went out with a bitter look on
his face

  he stood retreat that night and
reveille next morning at drill i had
sergeant meade fall out and drill um
alone after drill he worked at the
company papers at one oclock ser-
geant meade came for um givin me a
growl you may be sure

   drill cantenwine he says

  what does this mean says can-
tenwine theres only one drill a
day

   two for recruits i says go on

  well he stood it two weeks then
one mornin corprl bush in charge
o quarters reported um absent from
check the night before but he said
here at reveille after breakfast i
asked bush did you report canten-
wine absent from check roll call to the
officer o the day last night

   no bowman i didnt says bush
it was his first offense you know and
i-

   thats all right bush i says we
were an outfit of old-timers and we
had a few regulations of our own
glad you didnt pass the word to re-
port um next time though

  when cantenwine showed up in the
office before drill his eyes showed drink

   dont miss check again canten-
wine i told um-just like that never
lookin up from me work

  a week passed cantenwine was
silent and dark then it was time to
make out the pay rolls i excused can-
tenwine from all regular duty per
capns orders and put um at the rolls
then i went with the company on a
three days hike when we come back
the corprl left in charge o quarters
reported that cantenwine had been ab-
sent since the day we left i went to
the man bull pellum broke



the office the pay rolls hadnt been
touched

  by golly i was hot i got a dumb-
head to help me much against his will
and we went to work to clean up the
rolls it was a big job but we finished
it in time on the day they had to go
off as we were comparin em canten-
wine sauntered in bleary with booze
and sullen old bull sprang to his feet

  get outa this office he yelled
sergeant bowman confine this man in
the guardhouse awaitin trial

  so in the mill goes recruit canten-
wine

  bull had um tried and the sum-
mary court officer give um ten-ten
when cantemvines ten days were up
he reported in the office he found
sittin at his desk the fella whod helped
us on the rolls

  report to sergeant meade can-
tenwine i says

   but-but- he stared at the

private at his desk isnt there office
work to do

   there is i says but the company
clerk will attend to it youre a
straight-duty man from now on

  he clenched his fists and gritted his
teeth and stamped out hed thought
to teach me a lesson-see-by goin
absent when the rolls were due hed
thought to impress his great value upon
me and the capn but i was whippin
my raw man into pretty fair shape
and anyway id a done every scrap o
the work meself before id a let the
recruit into that office again

  well that was the beginnin of it
cantenwine started down the line and
in six months he was the company bum
before his first year was in he had a
bobtail hangin over um like the sword
of whats-his-name

  then bull pellum awoke to the pos-
sibilities

   sergeant bowman he says this
man cantenwine has a terrible record

-terrible and he rolled his eyes like
an old durham bull

   he has that sir i says five
summary court-martials hes spent
the greater part of his first year in the
guardhouse

   i wont have such a man in the or-
ganization he says

   the capn wont have um long i
remarked t imagine the next sum-
mary will-

  not without my approval ser-
geant he interrupts til attend to
this case meself ill break this man
its a disgrace to me company ill
make um soldier or go over the hill
send for um at once

but cantenwine wasnt in the post
 never mind sergeant says bull
thoughtfully on second thought ill
say nothin to um about it but ill be-
gin  um at once

  this to me alone o course me
and old bull understood each other
pretty well	n

  that night i met cantenwine down
in junction city in a saloon him and
a cavalry recruit were tankin up at
a table in the barroom cantenwine
had reached the conversational stage i
judged

  bowman he says come have a
drink with me

  nothin loath as the fella says for
time had washed out our difference i
went over and sat at the table

    bout three fingers o conversa-
tion fluid i told the bartender

  before me drink was on the table
the cavalryman left us

  bowman says cantenwine
squirmin low in his chair i wonder
what youre thinkin o me anyway
well you gotta be kinda careful in
sayin the truth to the fella thats buy-
in the drinks thinkin o you-hows
that i evaded

   youre thinkin youll soon be see-
in me in one o those places where the
bars are thickern your wrist aint you


new story magazine

  i ordered another pair of drinks
and when they were on the table i felt
free to hew a little nearer to the truth

   cantenwine i says  shouldnt
wonder if youve made a five that shot
your next breakll turn the trick but
i doubt if itll be leavenworth i think
theyll hand you a straight kick youre
not bad enough to be confined-just
worthless

   theyre out to hand it to me eh 
   they are

   bowman he says thoughtfully i
wonder wholl be fooled the worst when
this conspiracy fails to work

    meanin 

   that theres nothin doin i be-
gin soldierin to-night ive changed
me mind about bein a bad man

  i didnt say all i thought i says
yes well theres nothin so restin
as changin your mind now and then
 youre sarcastic he says really
bowman i didnt expect sarcasm from
you i had you sized up as the kind
to give the under dog a lift

   well cantenwine i says show
me a handholt

  he dumped his barely touched
schooner o beer into the cuspidor un-
der the table there she is he says
now take holt

   youre quittin

   i have quit

  i studied um no it wasnt booze
heroics he was sober enough and
serious enough

   you mean quittin for to-night i
says

   for all time says he

  i guess i smiled a little for he says
 seems youve heard that said be-
fore

   about a million times more or
less i told um

   well-he got to his feet-you
said show you a handholt and youd
help ive showed it to you all the
help i ask is that you as top soldier

forget the past in our future deal ins
he started out

   come back cantenwine i says
and when he stopped i went on can-
tenwine is it a woman

    it is not

   is it religion

  he shook his head

   i- know i says-and it must a
been exasperatin-youre naturally a
clean man and well raised you dont
wanta be kicked outa the army as use-
less youre a bum and a drunkard and
for you thered be the lot o such
thered be no clean sheets and good
grub and warm decent clothes without
hard work and you couldnt work
and hit up the booze so youve de-
cided that the creature comforts o the
army are worth more to you than the
life of a hobo is that straight talk 

   it certainly is he says without
anger in a way youre right but
the reason youve mentioned is only a
part o the whole im reformin be-
cause o me personal pride bowman
everybody thinks im no good theyve
forgot that you said i was the best
office man in this mans army how
easy people forget why bowman on

the outside i- but well forget that

the long and short o the present deal
is that i realize what me bunkies think
o me and me pride wont stand for
it im gonta reverse the opinion

   kid i says i hope you mean it
takin it all in all its a mighty good
reason for reformation its more prac-
tical than melodramatic go to it

  thanks bowman-and he was
gone

  i ordered another jolt and dropped
into deep musin it wasnt till then
that i remembered what old bull pel-
lum had told me that very day-that
he had decided to break cantenwine

   now i says to meself heres
crossed wires again in this mans army
bull will be breakin a man thats al-
ready decided to break umself bull
the man bull pellum broke



will begin the inquisition and canten-
wine his own reformation at one and
the same time neither will know the
others hand i wont tell either of
em if cantenwine cn weather the gale
hes built o that stuff men are made
of if when bull tightens the screws
cantenwine throws up the sponge
in despair-well if he does i reckon
ill be tempted to stick me own beak
into the thing itll be a royal test
you see cantenwine had convinced me
that he meant business

  now though cantenwine had been
handed five summaries his progress
along the downward path had been
pretty smooth once a man gets to be
a guardhouse bum confinement dont
bother um a great deal bull had paid
no attention to um till he awoke to the
knowledge that he was lettin a possi-
bility slip away from um hed pay
some attention to um now believe me

 next day was saturday we had
inspection at nine oclock now bull
was a capn that generally looked on
inspection as a farce-which it is hed
walk along the line takin rifles in an
absent-minded way and slam em back
without a look we were in the main
an outfit o careful clean soldiers and
bull knew it and let it go at that
now cantenwine since hed started
the incorrigible stunt had been the most
careless soldier in fort riley but bull
had never noticed um

  coinin out of me office at drill call
i met cantenwine on the veranda i
stopped and stared at um

  he had on a new clean uniform that
fit um like de paper on de vail his
buttons were glitterin his bayonet
scabbard had been polished till it shone
you could see your face in his shoes
his tin cup bangin on his haversack
had been scoured till it was a shame to
touch it o course i didnt examine
his piece but it was safe to bet it was
in a class with the rest o his equip-
ment

  his eyes twinkled at me as i started
movin on with an apologetic cough

   dont forget that handholt bow-
man he says in a low voice

   i wont me boy i says you look
like a soldier to me keep it up in
spite of everything and youll win out
 i mean to says he

  twenty minutes later old bull pel-
lum passin along the line in his in-
spection stopped before cantenwine

 stand up like a man he bellowed
i heard the snap o wood and metal
as bull took the kids piece outa the
corner o me eye i saw bull slam it
back at um

  present that piece properly he
roared

i heard it click as it changed hands
again then came a long pause then 
 first sergeant bowman give can-
tenwine ten days extra kitchen police
for havin a dirty gun

   very well sir i replied

  the piece snapped back and bull
moved on down the line

  bull spent ten minutes in me office
after inspection but never opened his
mouth about cantenwine he started
home and was barely outa sight when
there come a knock at the door can-
tenwine entered with his rifle

  his eyes were flashin and his lower
lip where his teeth were set into it was
white he marched straight to me and
held out the piece

   bowman he choked look at it
look at it take it to the light there
aint a cleaner gun in this battalion

   cantenwine i says refusin to ac-
cept his piece this aint military your
piece may be clean but dye propose
that i examine it then tell the capn
that he was wrong leave the office
 but bowman-and the despair in
his eyes fairly made me sick-it is
clean i worked on it for three hours

and-and--- he never called me

down before ive gone to inspection


new story magazine

a sight and here i worked so hard
and-and i was proud bowman

   leave the office cantenwine i
said coldly and he went staggerin out

  i had um begin his ten days extra
kitchen police next mornin he came
out to drill with a sullen look on his
face

  now the daily inspection dont
amount to a whoop the company
commander usually just walks round
the company and thats all there is to it
but this momin bull started from the
right o the company and walked past
twenty men till he reached cantenwine
there he stopped short

   put your heels together he bel-
lowed

  he took a step and snatched can-
ten wines rifle

   you havent touched this since yes-
terday sergeant bowman give can-
tenwine ten days extra kitchen police
for neglectin to clean his rifle for drill
and cantenwine take your rifle to the
first sergeant every mornin before drill
till you learn what a clean piece looks
like

  bull snapped the rifle back and
walked on round the command not
stoppin at another man

  i didnt see cantenwine again all
that day next mornin ten minutes
before drill call he knocked at the door
and come into the office

  his face was red with humiliation
and his eyelashes hid his eyes with-
out a word he come straight over to
me and passed me his rifle

  i took it and went to the window i
shot open the bolt and examined the
chamber and the inside o the barl
then i looked her over from muzzle to
butt piece me own rifle after an
hours work wouldnt a matched her
she was clean steel and no mistake i
wished bull pellum had found some
other means o breakin cantenwine

   i pass it i says to um and handed
it back

  cantenwine turned on his heel and
left the office

  at drill bull stopped before um
again and took the piece

   did you show this to sergeant
bowman  he roared after a pause

    i did sir

   sergeant bowman youd better
have the doctor examine your eyes
bull bellowed up the line at me this
piece is rusty-filthy clean it can-
tenwine and keep showing it to the first
sergeant before drill ten days extra
kitchen police for cantenwine ser-
geant  bowman

   very well sir i replied

  back snapped the rifle bull passed
on round the company

  the followin mornin as i passed
along the veranda a little before drill
call i heard somebody bawl out

   time to take your gun to bowman
cant

  there followed a roar o laughter
from a dozen throats i knew how that
would cut the ridicule o the men
would be worse than all the extra duty
bull could hand out

  ten minutes later as cantenwine
stood before me in the office there was
a tear in each eye as he passed me his
piece i aint a hard man it aint in
me i nearly give in at sight o that
however i believed the inquisition
would do the boy a world o good the
army aint a nest o feathers and can-
tenwine hadnt learned it yet

   well  he asked as i handed back
the rifle

   i pronounce it fit for any inspec-
tion i told um

   then bull knozvs its clean he
ground out

   ask um i says and turned to me
desk

  he come closer to me bowman
he says whats the matter with you
have you got it in for me

   not at all i says i pronounce
your gun clean im not responsible
the man bull pellum broke



for capll pellums opinions canten-
wine hes capn over me as well as
over you

   why is it he says that he didnt
worry his head about me till i made up
me mind to turn over a new leaf  the
minute i begin to soldier he begins
rid in me 

   have you thought i asked um
that maybe youre just beginnin to get
what was coinin to you all along

   i paid for what i did in the guard-
house he says now ive turned over
a new leaf-i oughta be given a
chance

   well im not in it i told um
take your troubles to the capn

  things run along about that way
till saturday come again cantenwine
now had forty days extra kitchen work
starin um in the face as usual he
come to me with bis rifle before drill
call

   i want you to examine me entire
equipment bowman he says and i
did

   all o k i says and looked um
over from head to foot

   well see he says and went out

  he got five days fatigue for a
dirty belt buckle

  two days later was pay day can-
tenwine drew his money and went back
to the kitchcn to finish the day after
the supper dishes were done he dressed
up and started walkin fast for the hack
line

   ill go too i says to meself i
kinda wanted to see if cantenwine was
gonta take his troubles to old man
booze

  i missed the hack that he caught
but followed in another fifteen minutes
later

  downtown i mosied along from sa-
loon to saloon takiu an occasional
drink and lookin through the pay-day
crowds for cantenwine i didnt find
um finally in a blind pig which our
outfit infested in those days i heard

some one say hed seen cantenwine buy-
in a ticket for the show

  cantenwine was at work in the
kitchen at breakfast time with a clear
eye and steady arm under the piles o
dishes

   this kids got metal i says luck
go with um

  six months followed at the end o
which the duty roster showed that pri-
vate cantenwine had a hundred days
extra kitchen police ahead of um how
old bull pellum had ridden the boy
and how the boy had stood it every
day for um meant drudgery in the
kitchen except when he was on guard
four times i think it was he got or-
derly at guard mount that means
that the officer o the day picked um to
be orderly to the commandin officer
because he was the cleanest and most
soldierly-lookin man to mount guard
that day

  once though when bull pellum was
officer o the day he threw cantenwine
out as not fit to mount guard canten-
wine was for goin to the commandin
officer but in despair i reckon he
backed out always he soldiered clean
as a whistle and right to the dot al-
ways bull pellum turned his best ef-
forts into mockery

  one day i met cantenwine in a sa-
loon downtown he was sittin at a
table with a half-empty whisky glass
before um i sidled over and dropped
into a chair

  havin a little quiet jolt i asked

   yes says he-several of em
bartender take bowmans order

  i ordered a whisky and threw it
home

   you aint drinkin i says to can-
tenwine

  he was sittin settled low in his
chair in deep broodin thought

  he took a sip and set the glass back
on the able

   ive had several he says


new story magazine

  thought youd quit i says after
a little

   i was afraid you werent goin to
say that bowman he retorts

   oh im a bromide i reckon i
laughed

   youre a deep devil he remarked
a little later tell me what youre
thinkin

   im thinkin i says that some-
body in this mans army quit drinkin
and braced up simply because of his
personal pride

   so i did says he but whats the
use 

   whats the use o personal pride
you mean

  he looked at me sharply then low-
ered his eyes for a minute he didnt
speak when he did he says

   bowmhn youre right i did quit
and brace up simply because o personal
pride i didnt do it to satisfy bull
pellum nor anybody else in this army
and by golly bowman bull pellum
nor nobody is goin to down that per-
sonal pride ill soldier like a man
because in so doin i satisfy private
lewis cantenwine theres no reward
but me own satisfaction bull pellum
may ride me to the end o me enlist-
ment but he cant ride the pride outa
me

  i grabbed at um as he sprang to his
feet i was ready to tell um all about
it but he hadnt seen me hed hur-
ried outa the saloon

  next mornin when bull pellum
come into me office he found canten-
wines record for the past seven months
laid out for his inspection

   mm-m-mm-m he says pretty
good-pretty good you think ive
broken um do you sergeant

   i think hes broke sir i says

   mm-m-send for um

  a little later cantenwine stood be-
fore um from head to foot the old
man looked um over

   cantenwine says bull ive been
lookin over your record for the past
seven months it shows quite a change
in you im proud to say i wont have
a poor man in me company canten-
wine ill make um or break um

   me record sir  says cantenwine
bitterly and laughed a short snort

   there are two records of you
says bull one is me private record
the other one is in this office for any
one to see this one is clean for seven
months im gonta let up on you now
cantenwine dye think your personal
pride cn keep you decent for the rest
o your enlistment

  cantenwine stared slowly from bull
pellum to me in a flash he saw it all
i got busy with me papers

   it will sir he says to bull

  bull pellum leaned back with a
broad smile on his face before um
he thought stood a sample of his han-
diwork it pleased i um a few last
lovin touches here and there and it
would be a masterpiece

   sergeant bowman he rumbled
scratch off all extra duty against pri-
vate cantenwine relieve thompson
and detail cantenwine as company
clerk make out a warrant appointin
private cantenwine corprl dated to-
day make out another one dated to-
morrow promotin corprl cantenwine
to sergeant thats all cantenwine
once more cantenwine staggered
out o me office-this time blind with
bewilderment and unbelief bull pel-
lum sat at his desk and rolled his eyes
like some old king o the range-and
smiled and smiled and smiled
the scm

by donald fra in cis mcgrew

the streets of duluth are no place
for thin-blooded people in the fall
of the year and especially those nar-
row thoroughfares along the water
front they reek of labor agencies and
are overshadowed by near-by mon-
strous ore bins in the evenings the
rays from the windows of the many
saloons give forth but little light and
warmth

  however i had been told that in
one of them i might find barney
oshaughnessy labor agent of parts
and possessed of a huge thirst so i
hurried down one of the unkempt
streets and pushed open the door of
the first saloon

  my entrance you might say was pro-
pitious that is if you are a lover of
the art la boxe staged in the manner
of a battle royal

  as i opened the door sounds of an
argument reached my ears i had been
told that many steam-shovel men were
wont to rub elbows here men who
are prone to grow both loquacious and
pugnacious the reports were fully
verified just as i turned the screen
i saw several men evidently mechanics
rush a lone man at the bar-a young
man a six-footer whose chief claims
to notice were a cheerful grin a shock
of red hair and a pair of wide nerv-
ous shoulders they fell on him fore
and aft front and flank expressing the
most arduous of intentions blotting
him from view like a storm smother

  however their supremacy was but
momentary of all the casual well-
glad-to-meet-you gladiators i have ever
seen that redhead took the bunting

  it was like removing nickels from
a blind man the assaulting army
stopped tripped one another disinte-
grated and did rigadoons on their ears
leaving triumphant he of the grin and
the lightning fists he looked round
the room still grinning sarcastically

  well he said any one else want
to get their feet wet

  evidently waders were not numer-
ous now and his eyes fell on me

  do you think the rawhider is a
scab he demanded of me

  my answer was both instantaneous
and tactful i dont know the gentle-
man i said have a drink and
in the interests of peace i included the
room

  those on the floor picked themselves
up while the deft and impartial indij
vidual behind the bar whisked several
foaming tankards into sight

  we never knew you was a friend to
this guy the rawhider one of the
men explained in a conciliatory tone
else we wouldnt have chewed the rag
about im aint you a union man

  i am that declared the conqueror
heartily and a good one interna-
tional brotherhood of steam shovel
and dredgemen thats what i belong
to about me bein a friend of this
rawhider now-


new story magazine

  pardon me i interrupted who
is this rawhider

  he is a shovel runner friend from
chi names callahan french des-
cent but irish by looks they call him
the rawhider because he can drop back
and forth through the pit as fast as the
next one see and he generally does it

  as for me bein a friend o the raw-
hiders some would say i wasnt and
some wouldnt but you guys listen to
me you as wasnt up there aint no
call to label him a scab no sir he
aint no scab nor he aint no hero
either like the trust papers called him
hes just a shovel engineer that did his
duty by his employers and bust a strike
that wasnt right

  the red warrior paused inhaled the
appreciative silence buried his nose in
the tankard and went on

  no sir he wasnt no scab you fel-
lows listen to me while i warble

  in the first place this rawhider
shovel runner by profession and game
by nature lies up in hibbing hunting a
job the same sad state of affairs being
traceable to the failure of jones
brothers at colerane thats because
they try to buck the iron range with
two old fogy supers who think they can
dig this range overburden without
shooting

  so the rawhider sashays up to the
office of one silvery mike monahan
the same who for the benefit of our
boston friend here ill explain holds
down the office of secretary to local
number seventy-six international
brofherhood of steam shovel and
dredgemen-and all the leons and
accouterments and graft pertaining
thereto

  now this mikes a character big-
gish man he was but small a medium-
sized man about two hundred pounds
he has a chicago alderman smell to
im and the same way of wearin a
cigar and no artist can paint any soul

into that catfish physog he aint got
none

  says our hero hows chances to
gel out mr monahan

   no good says mr monahan
we have all we can do placing our
local members you fellows from the
grand lodge oughta look to chi and
tom dolan

   but i hear theres a crew needed
at the kinney mine for that contractor
foote argues the rawhider you
aint got no crews in so whats the
matter o me takin it

   well says silvery mike then-
quite judicious he was and at the same
time ready to slide on the other side of
the fence-well it might be fixed
getting out from under brick houses
aint no lost art to a bachelor of per-
ceptions our subject he pulls out a
ten-spot of the realm-the last in his
kick

   will this fix it he asks sweet and
ingratiating

  silvery mike he reaches for that
ten but thats as far as he gets our
hero reverses

   any time he says that i have to
kick in to a jellyfish like you for a job
-me thats paid my dues since i tal-
lowed on the drainage-well i guess
not mr monahan its us to the floor
friends it was scandalous i mean
the way mr m monahan fades from
the scenery our lochinvar never had
a chance

  youll never get no job on this
range now unless you scab yells sil-
very through the keyhole of the closet
door

  wont i was the pree-sidjus re-
tort take it from your uncle ill
hike up there and nab that job to-day
but friends things dont look as
rosy as that bluff when the rawhider
gets down on the street no the
oliver mines are full up and the ma-
honing and all the big contractors-
winston-deere drake  stratton
the scab



john butler too theres a good chance
that hell be eatin snowballs on a tie-
pass special if he squanders part of
that ten goin to buhl maybe mona-
han has dug up a crew or some one
else has copped and thered be our
little gosling about four months walk
from gods country-which is chi-
and nothin in the exchequer but hopes
and oh hell

  so hes hiking toward the great
northern depot his feet gettin slower
when somethin happens

  theres a noise stirs up close by
its in a jewelry shop a prospective
shindy bein always interestin to the
party of the first part he strolls in
thinkin maybe hell buy a folderol
maybe or a bonmot

  theres a young fellow in there
gettin his from the squint-eyed jew-
eler

   i tell you squeaks the last-named
animal i dont care who you are
thems my sentiments cash or noth-
ing you cant take my watch unless
you pay cash

   but i offered you my check says
the young fellow like a man who aint
used to havin his paper sniffed at

  but he dont budge that jeweler
makes no difference he says that
checks on the ruhl bank and you say
youre not acquainted here

   my word the customer exclaims
this is damnably exasperating and
he frisks himself again to see if he cant
rake up enough loose change to make
up what he owes you can see he
wants that watch pretty bad

  friends you never can tell by look-
ing at a barn door whether theres a
mule inside or a horse but this fel-
low hes thoroughbred a big lad he
was with mackinaw high-topped shoes
corduroys and a cap with automobile
goggles dirty he was but clean stub-
ble o beard on his face but clean
shaven youve seen that kind of a

guy-

  so our hero bein a man o insight
he sees this he acts by impulse and
he says to the jeweler how much
does this man owe

   seven dollars says the jeweler-
just that quick you know like hes the
most insulted man in the world

  well then our samaritan he pro-
duces the ten-case note take it out
o this he says and quit the jewelry
business you need some one around
here to polish the ivory

   but i say the young fellow breaks
in i cant allow this you dont know
me

   your face is good was the an-
swer you can give me the check
ive got friends around here will in-
dorse it whats the name

   my name says mr thorough-
bred is ronald t foote

  fellow citizens you couldve
knocked our friend callahan over
yes it was him foote the young con-
tractor who wants the crew hed
never been in hibbing nor met mona-
han doing business by mail or over the
phone so that little favor saved him
some little inconvenience presenting
credentials to the secretary he had
rushed into hibbing for some small
castings

  to make it short i ask you-did
the rawhider get that job answer-
he did thats how he and his crane-
man come to be in the big buzz wagon
that evening heading for buhl with the
boss every now and then pressin a
nickled dingus that chimed out mary
ooch

  it dont do silvery mike any good
to kick if you raise any hell says
the rawhider to him over the phone
ill put tom dolan wise to you and
your names pee-ronius mud

  which quiets m silvery monahan
for the time bein

  the next night the new crew is out
on the big buck slamming away two
weeks later when t foote sees what


new story magazine

 kind of an organist r callahan is on
 that little toy r c is on the day shift
 at one seventy-five per month the
 extra fifty being slipped to him on the
 q t understand because the scale all
 over the range is one-twenty-five and
 a bonus of forty per at the end of the
 season to engineers and foote dont
 want to get in bad with the kinney
 people who are only paying their crews
 standard and dont want to go higher

   i motioned the bartender and the
 narrator paused long enough to hide his
 face in the foam

    friends he continued with a sigh
 that was a steam shovel she was as
 spanking a ninety-five-ton panama type
 bucyrus as ever come outa milwaukee
 set way down in a forty-foot lift she
 was with one hundred and sixty feet of
 - bank shoving up to the sky on the next
 bench to the south  and nighttimes she
 coughed her sparks clear to the top
 six dips a minute she could make if
 you made her and fill the bucket-say
 boys she was a baby doll

    well things went pretty smooth for
 a time maybe youve seen the kinney
 mine they figured the ore lay in a
 long narrow strip so they went
 straight down instead of working in
 circles like the mahoning result a
 long hole two hundred feet deep an
 eighth of a mile wide three quarters of
 a mile long at top and a quarter mile
 long at bottom theres two approaches
 at either end about a quarter mile long
 for the ore tracks and the dump tracks
 both standard gauge

    when this kinney outfit hit the ore
 they found after a bit there was about
 as much taconite in spots as there was
 ore it was a case of strip wider they
 didnt want to take one of their two
 shovels outa the ore during the rush
 summer season to do the stripping so
 they let it to foote with a reserve clause
 sayin that he kicks back with a big
 daily forfeit if he dont clear the bases
 by a certain day in november

  that was the big bur under his
saddle foote he was worrying quite
a bit about that forfeit cause it seems
he aint due to make any too much on
this job anyway him being new to the
range and having taken the job at a
pretty low figure cave-ins from that
big back on the second lift had laid him
out quite a little not to speak of guys
whod only taken jobs on his machine
to make a stake

  but pretty soon after our subject
appears things commence to tune up
better with a well-shot forty-foot
bank and standard-gauge dumps under
you all the time and a ninety-five buck
with her tail in the air-well i claim a
shovel man ought to go some and that
shovel runner did he hit the ball

  so as i say things got to looking
pretty good when-zingo-m silvery
monahan throwed in from right and
put the whole side out at the plate

  bing it was a peach heave what
did that bay-windowed grafter do but
call a general strike on the range

  yes sir for the benefit of our
new yawk friend here ill eloocidate
as i told you the standard on the
range was one-twenty-five per month
with a bonus of forty payable at the
end of the season for shovel engineers
and ninety and thirty for cranemen
the trust set that standard and every-
body follows suit on the mesaba

  now that scale is higher than the
union standard throughout the country
-one-twenty-five and ninety flat the
boys ought tove been satisfied but
what did silvery mike do but get them
to kick for that bonus every month
and when the trust bucked he called a
strike

  were they fools for walking out
you get me you cant buck that trust
in the long run furthermore theyd
been perfectly fair and aboveboard

  the thing would neverve happened
if tom dolan general secretary in chi-
cago had known of it before it was too
the scab



late he didnt though the boys did
the same fool stunt when they tried to
buck the united states government on
the panama canal without consultin
him or that strike would never have
happened tom dolan is the headiest
squarest piece of machinery handling
union men to-day and if any one says
he aint ill bust his konk

  thats the way the rawhider ex-
plains his view of the lay of things to
his boss foote

   well says foote sighing the two
kinney crews and my night crew are
going-and us about ready to dig out
and back up too on this cut what do
you intend to do

   why me for you says our hero

   and me too his craneman chimes
in

   it isnt just because im paying you
higher wages intimates foote

   naw says the rawhider its
principle and-other things i wont
get you in bad with the kinney people
by tellin you raised wages

  with that they struck hands
growin maybe a little sentimental
around the dong beater so to speak
that young foote was the original
candy

  however it was different sorts of
sentiments which the rawhider ex-
presses to silvery monahan when he
calls up

   i hear you aint a-goin out says
monahan

   i aint says the rawhider

   are you gettin your bonus every
month monahan demands

   thats none o your damn busi-
ness was the retort

   you scab yells monahan ill
have you blackballed

   youll lay golden eggs says our
hero when you eat regular ill stay
on the job

  thats the way our shovel man
finneganed to monahan

  take it from me though you never

can tell by lampin a cloud whether
theres rain there or merely a tornado
foote and his shovel runner figured
theyd put a silver linin on theirs by
promotin the day craneman to the job
runnin nights but m monahan he
promulgates a new think

  you see hed tied up the trust
pretty well for the time bein they
had to put clerks and straw bosses on
their steam shovels and you know
about how much they batted one-
seventy-six minus besides that mon-
ahan had talked all the finns and aus-
trians into hittin for two-fifty instead
of two bones a day so the trust was
forced to look to independent com-
panies like the kinney for ore the
kinney had hired a couple o pretty
good nonunion crews to take the place
of their shovel men who had struck
and monahan knew that if foote kept
the stripping ahead of them the kin-
ney was goin to make a good bid to
help the trust hang on that is in
company with the rest o the independ-
ent companies

  consequently the morning footes
crew dug out and the finns were busy
blockin and tampin the track to back
up on m monahan takes an embellish-
in swing at the pill and burns i clear
over the center-field fence

 	he does that

  what does he do but come up to
the kinney that morning and talk our
finns into hoistin the banner of
anarchy and hydrophobia for undyin
principles and two dollars and fifty
cents the same bein some of the rhet-
oric mr monahan molts to the pie-
eyed finns

  do they fall for it inference-they
hit the ground ahead of time finns
and independence is brothers and what
eye-talians foote has is easily per-
suaded to join bein only about ten in
number them eye-talians takes the line
o least resistance urged by british-gov-
ernment tactics and finn brickbats

t

  well now wasnt it some dirty
tie-up you win it was they say
a guy named mark antony moved the
frenchies to tears once when they was
goin to lectrocute henry the eight
but he couldnt a moved any ore from
that pit not even spirits was movin-
cept those o rebellion and john bar-
leycorn

  it like to broke foote up he was
gray around the gills

   im willin to compromise on two-
twenty-five he says to monahan but
i cant go higher itll break me

  two fifty or nothin for you and
the kinney both says silvery so there
they were

   maybe says foote to the raw-
hider i can dig up enough eye-talian
labor at hibbing to-morrow to go on
with this work the kinneys figurin
to ship some in if they can get em
too but its a long chance and he
sighs theres no strike clause in his
contract and hes due for the grand
toboggan if things dont brighten up
real quick

   one thing says the rawhider
theres nothin to prevent us backin
up this afternoon shes out on the
track and all ready

  no sooner said than done right
after dinner our hero and his craneman
with the tallow and foote they go up
to the buck knock out the clamps
loosen the jacks and get ready to move
back

  just a moment i broke in here
how did you expect to propel it

  he of the red crown stared at me
oh i forgot he grinned then
youre from bar harbor or maybe
byrn mawr them things-

the governor of north carolina

- i hastened to interrupt here

and my aid-de-camp with the apron
came into prominence once more

  keno said the narrator now ill
resume

a steam shovel mr harvard is

moved not by instinct but by steam
theres hoisting engines to hoist the
bucket and swinging engines to swing
the boom and crane engines to thrust
the sticks to which the bucket is fas-
tened to move a mill you have pro-
pelling chains running over sheaves on
the truck axles to sheaves on a pro-
pelling shaft underneath the car body
this is thrown in and out o communi-
cation with the hoisting engines by
means of a clutch and when youre
diggin this clutch is out and when you
want to move you throw it in

  i see i nodded profoundly

  yes said red i learned that out
of a book but to resume

  they loosened the jacks-hold on
id better explain what them is too
jacks is big steel casting braces 
either side of a machine in which some
thoughtful man with a college educa-
tion figures theyd better put big jack-
screws to keep the machine from tip-
pin over when the boom swings these
are screwed down tight when youre
diggin and loosened up to allow you
to move yes that guy was a thought-
ful man

  now dont get impatient you shovel
stiffs colleges aint educated up to
shovels yet but maybe if some one was
to ask you what repartee was youd
think it was some kind of a flower it
aint its something to eat

  to resume our hero of this bunch
starts to back up goin down the west
hill from clamp to clamp without any
mishap up to this time no finns had
appeared but when the rawhider opens
up to walk her along the level stretch
them finns show up along the bank
you can see the chief assets in their
repetoree is scowls and medium-sized
bowlders

  friends that dont look so good
theres houses over them shovels but
them finns is numerous and bilious
some one of ems liable to sift a donick
the scab



through the window and make a three-
cushion carom off your nut

  but nothin like that happens in-
stead mr monahan he comes walkin
into the pit by himself

   i wont stand responsible for what
them finns might do if you try to dig
he tells foote

   were just backin up says
foote

   well if thats all says silvery i
guess i can hold em back and he
starts as though to go away then
changes his mind could i get up and
talk with that engineer of yours he
asks

   sure foote tells him you see
footes got confidence in his runner

  all this time remember theyre roll-
in back and rollin back with foote
the tallow and the craneman walkin
alongside to watch the joints and the
flanges so when monahan gets on
theyre startin up the east grade

  silvery deposits himself at the head
end alongside of where our subject is
at the levers front of the bulkhead on
the right-hand side hes so oily and
intimate he dont even want to stand
on the runnin board and talk through
the window no he comes inside
sos no one can hear him

   callahan he says youre makin
a big chump of yourself the boysll
have you blackballed for this

   swell chance says callahan im
gettin standard wages-one-twenty-five
and forty bonus

   youre not gettin standard wages
monahan declares the new scale on
the range is one-sixty-five a month

   thats what you say is the re-
tort

   now dont be uppish silvery
comes back if youll just stop and
reflect youll see that youre dead
wrong you aint doin justice to your
union oath nor yourself nor your fel-
low men thats being held down in slav-
ery by the enemy of the masses

  huh reflect if m monahan had
known just what r callahan was re-
flectin on then he wouldve got right
off that shovel and gone away and
died

  but m callahan dont let on he
keeps his eyes on the teeterin boom
joggin the swingin lever now and then
to take the weight off this or that side
and he keeps frownin while the ma-
chine keeps backin-frownin like hes
reflectin you know-and finally he
says sparring for time

   well how is it i aint doin justice
to my fellow members i aint afraid
of gettin my bonus

   look here monahan says
youre one of the keynotes o this
strike i got this place tied up tempo-
rarily though he may call on the gov-
ernor and get militia to keep the finns
away froni men he brings in but with
all the men in the world whats he going
to do without a shovel runner all the
scab crews are lined tip now with the
exception o those already working
hell have to make one if you come in
with us he cant keep his stripping
ahead of the ore shovels-and-well
do you see the result

  the rawhider did an honest em-
ployer busted over a bonehead strike
and a chance maybe for m monahan
to gouge employers for hush money to
arbitrate thats what the rawhider
sees

  but he sees something else too he
sees hes walkin that ninety-five up the
grade without the craneman to help him
with the bucket which is held up by
blocks in the shipper-shaft pinions
above the track he sees hes gettin
along up near the top and that hes mov-
in over a mighty good solid track and
he sees also inward visions that are
both outrageous and delicious

  so he keeps frownin as the ma-
chine keeps chugging back then just
as she rolls onto the last easy grade
and the men on the ground quit put-


new story magazine

ting clamps on the rail that being an
apparently useless precaution now-
well then mr callahan looks at mr
monahan and he says real low how
much of the velvet is there in it for me
if you hold foote up to arbitrate

  silvery he draws a quick breath
but be shows his hand twenty per
cent he says real quick

  pause-to let the situation soak in
as it were

  friends can you see it theyre
near the top ahead o that buck is
about a mile o track which drops down
straight into that pit and up the other
side it was good track too as shovel
tracks go for it had been laid piece by
piece and tamped and fairly well bal-
lasted by an experienced track gang
that laid it right along behind the shovel
as she dug besides it had been settled
by the shovel backing over it other-
wise our hero might not have taken a
chance and there were no curves in
it either which he likewise noticed

  backin up a hill that way you gen-
erally have a tie dragging along in front
of your trucks to catch you if you start
slipping a little

  well back of the machine a little
knob shows up at which the rawhider
lets her stall he tried to take the slack
ahead and cant because the tie gets
him so he calls down to foote please
take that tie away-i want the slack 

  then he turns to monahan make
it forty per cent he says to him

  you hog do you want the earth
silvery grunts but friends he never
gets no answer

  them fellows had stepped clear
with the tie and as the rawhider
throws over the reverse lever into the
forward motion he slips maybe by ac-
cident and his hand hits the hoisting
throttle

  jee-roos-a-lem jones there never
was a man fell out of a shot tower
quicker than that buck started for the
bottom of that pit

  query-did she roll oh mamma
she rolledin four turns shes makin
thirty and in eight about seventy-six
and mr monahan caught inside with-
out a chance to jump he comes along

  was he scared step right up to
the end of the class scranton mr
monahan sprouts thirty-seven gray
hairs the first jump and a case of

d	ts

  he had reason to hed been a
shovel runner well he knew them
ninety-fives they aint any wider
than the smaller shovels account of
the standard gauge and their booms is
twice- as heavy a little jog to the
right or left especially going the way
they were and there theyd be bouncing
themselves off the scenery and the
shovel on top of em like a mass play
also if she jumps the track which is
a good one but not meant for a lim-
ited there aint much left for those
aboard her but high mass and bouquets
you shovel stiffs know that all a run-
ner can do in a case like that is to hang
onto the swinging lever tryin to keep
her from tippin and pray to the good
lord she stays on the track

  so there they were our hero froze
to the swinging lever monahan clutch-
in his shoulder and that rockin roar-
in grindin avalanche hurlin itself to-
ward glory in a hand basket

  our conjurer paused here leaving
me hung in mid-air and picturing
marred hillsides mangled bodies and
a pile of scattered scrap iron but he
must have read my thoughts

  no boston he resumed putting
down his glass it dont end that way
ill admit that thats what oughta hap-
pened maybe to a guy that takes them
kind of chances with his employers
property and one worthless life in the
interests of a square deal versus m
monahan grafter but i guess they
wasnt due to execute any acrobatic
marvels over the landscape

  what did happen was this-and it
the scab



happened p d q plus faster than i
can tell it with the machine a-rockin
and the bank a-whistlin by that
screechin tornado reached the bottom
level stretch before mr blue funk let
go the clamps on silverys jaws then
with a dyiiv mans squeal he yells
for gods sake stop her drop the
bucket-reverse her-do anything-
only stop her

  friends it was delicious

  the buck was then makin one-
ninety-five an hour or thereabouts
however theres that level stretch and
monahan knows heres a good chance
to ease her up and stop the parade on
the west hill thats what he figures the
rawhiderll try to do as maybe it aint
percolated into his cranium yet that this
is a cold deck but right away he sees
for our hero he cuts loose of a sardonic
grin scared as he is and he reaches for
the hoisting throttle which of course
hes closed and he yells out above all
that roar

   send back the finns at two-twenty-
five or ill open her up again 

  a sigh of appreciation ran up and
down the line of listeners and this
time the bartender needed no prompt-
ing

  well concluded the narrator with
a seraphic smile thats the way mr
callahan put the hooks into monahan
he arbitrated he arbitrated so thor-
ough i had to help him off the machine
when i got her stopped a miserable
shakiiv wreck

  what you aint guessed it was
me surest thing you know the
newspapers has a spiel of how the ma-
chine gets away and i saves her and
the two lives by sticking at me post of
duty and keepin her from upsetting
you fellows saw what the papers said
they called me a scab hero but i aint
im red callahan the rawhider windy
at times but game by nature and i
aint no scab and i aint no hero but
by god im a man

chapter ix

the great attempt

hphere are supercilious critics who
sneer at scotland yard they are
quite unofficial critics of course writers
of stories wherein figure amateur de-
tectives of abnormal perspicuity unrav-
eling with consummate ease mysteries
which have baffled the police for years
as a matter of fact scotland yard
stands for the finest police organization
in the world people who speak glibly
of police blunders might remember
one curious fact in this last quarter of
a century only one man has ever stood
in the dock at the old bailey under the
capital charge who has escaped the
dread sentence of the law

  scotland yard is patiently slow and
terribly sure

  angel in his little room received a
letter written in a sprawling unedu-
cated hand it was incoherent and
stained with tears and underlined from
end to end he read it through and 
examined the date stamp then rang his
bell

  the messenger who answered him
found him examining a map of lon-
don go to the record office and get

e	b ninety-three he said and in five
minutes the messenger came back with
a thick folder bulging with papers

  there were newspaper cuttings and
plans and dreadful photographs the like
of which the outside world do not see
and there was a little key ticketed with
angel esquire



an inscription angel looked through
the dossier carefully then read the
womans letter again

  vinnis the man with the dead-white
face finishing his late breakfast and
with the pleasurable rustle of new bank
notes in his trouser pocket strolled
forth into commercial road e an
acquaintance leaning against a public
house gave him a curt nod of recog-
nition a bedraggled girl hurrying
homeward with her mans breakfast in
her apron shrank on one side knowing
vinnis to her sorrow a stray cur
cringed up to him as he stood for a
moment at the edge of the road and
was kicked for its pains

  vinnis was entirely without senti-
ment and besides even though the
money in his pocket compensated for
most things the memory of old george
and his babbling talk worried him

  somebody on the other side of the
road attracted his attention it was a
woman and he knew her very well
therefore he ignored her beckoning
hand two days ago he had had occa-
sion to reprove her and he had seized
the opportunity to dissolve summarily
the informal union that had kept them
together for five years so he made no
sign when the woman yith the bruised
face called him but turned abruptly
and walked toward aldgate

  he did not look round but by and by
he heard the patter of her feet behind
and once his name called hoarsely he
struck off into a side strefet with a rag-
ing devil inside him then when they
reached an unfrequented part of the
road he turned on her

  she saw the demon in his eyes and
tried to speak she was a penitent
woman at that moment and hysterically
ripe for confession but the savage men-
ace of the man froze her lips

  so he said his thin mouth askew
so after what ive said an what ive
done you follow me do you show-
ing me up in the street eh

  he edged closer to her his fist
doubled and she poor drab fascinated
by the snakelike glare of his dull eyes
stood rooted to the spot then with a
snarl he struck her-once twice-and
she fell a huddled moaning heap on
the pavement

  you may do things- in commercial
road e after lighting-up time that
are not permissible in the broad light
of the day unless it be saturday and
the few people who had been attracted
by the promise of a row were indignant
but passive after the manner of all
london crowds not so one quiet mid-
dle-aged man who confronted vinnis
as he began to walk away

  that was a particularly brutal thing
to do said the quiet mail

  vinnis measured him with his eye
and decided that this was not a man to
be trifled with

  ive got nothing to say to you he
said roughly and tried to push past
but an iron grip was on his arm

  wait a moment my friend said
the other steadily not so fast you
cannot commit a brutal assault in the
open street like that without punish-
ment i must ask you to walk with me
to the station

  suppose i wont go demanded
vinnis

  i shall take you said the other i
am detective sergeant jarvis from
scotland yard

  vinnis thought rapithy there wasnt
much chance of escape the street they
were in was a cul-de-sac and at the
open end two policemen had made their
appearance after all a wife as-
sault was hot a serious business and the
woman-well she would swear it was
an accident he resolved to go quietly
at the worst it would be a month so
with a shrug of his shoulders he ac-
companied the detective a small
crowd followed them to the station

  in the little steel dock he stood in
his stockinged feet while a deft jailer


new story magazine

ran his hands over him with a stifled
oath he remembered the money in his
possession it was only ten pounds for
he had secreted the other but ten
pounds is a lot of money to be found
on a person of his class and generally
leads to embarrassing inquiries to his
astonishment the jailer who relieved
him of the notes seemed in no whit
surprised and the inspector at the desk
look the discovery as a matter of course
vinnis remarked on the surprising
number of constables there were on
duty in the charge room then-

  what is the charge asked the in-
spector dipping his pen

  willful murder said a voice and
angel esquire crossed the room from
the inspectors office i charge this
man with having on the night of the
seventeenth of february-

  vinnis dumb with terror andrage
listened to the crisp tones of the detec-
tive as he detailed the particulars of
an almost forgotten crime it was the
story of a country-house burglary a
manservant who surprised the thief a
fight in the dark a shot and a dead man
lying in the big drawing-room it was
an ordinary little tragedy forgotten by
everybody save scotland yard  but year
by year unknown men had pieced to-
gether the scraps of evidence that had
come to them strand by strand had the
rope been woven that was to hang a
cold-blooded murderer last of all came
the incoherent letter from a jealous
woman-scotland yard waits always
for a jealous woman-and the evidence
was complete

  put him in number fourteen said
the inspector then vinnis woke up
and the six men on duty in the charge
room found their time fully occupied

  vinnis was arrested as angel es-
quire put it in the ordinary way of
business hundreds of little things
happen daily at scotland yard in the
ordinary way of business which ap-

parently unconnected one with the
other have an extraordinary knack of
being in some remote fashion related
a burglary at clapham was remarkable
for the fact that a cumbersome me-
chanical toy was carried away in ad-
dition to other booty a street acci-
dent in the kingsland road led to the
arrest of a drunken carman in the
excitement of the moment a sneak thief
purloined a parcel from the van was
chased and captured a weeping wife
at the police station gave him a good
character as husband and father only
last week he brought my boy a fine
performin donkey an alert detec-
tive went home with her recognized the
mechanical toy from the description
and laid by the heels- the notorious
kingsland road lot

  the arrest of vinnis was totally un-
connected with angels investigations
into the mystery of reales millions
he knew him as a borough man but
did not associate him with the search
for the word

  none the less there are certain for-
malities attached to the arrest of all
bad criminals angel esquire placed
one or two minor matters in the hands
of subordinates and in two days one
of these waited upon him in his office

  the notes sir said the man were
issued to mr spedding on his private
account last monday morning mr
spedding is a lawyer of the firm of
spedding mortimer  larach

  have you seen mr spedding he
asked

  yes sir mr spedding remembers
drawing the money and paying it away
to a gentleman who was sailing to
america

  a client

so far as i can gather said the
subordinate the money was paid on
behalf of a client for services mr
spedding would not particularize
angel esquire made a little grimace
lawyers certainly do queer things
angel

tie said dryly does mr spedding
offer any suggestion as to how the
money came into this mans posses-
sion 

  no sir he thinks he might have
obtained it quite honestly i under-
stand that the man who received the
money was a shady sort of customer

  so i should imagine said angel
esquire

  left alone he sat in deep thought
drawing faces on his blotting pad

  then he touched a bell

  send mr carter to me he directed
and in a few minutes a bright-faced
youth fingering an elementary mus-
tache was awaiting his orders

  carter said angel cautiously it
must be very dull work in the finger-
print department

  i dont know sir said the other a
fairly enthusiastic ethnologist weve

  carter said angel more cautiously
still are you on for a lark

  like a bird sir said carter un-
consciously humorous

  i want a dozen men the sort of
men who wont talk to reporters and
will remain unofficial so long as i want
them to be said angel and he un-
folded his plan

  when the younger man had gone
angel drew a triangle on the blotting
pad

  spedding is in with the borpugh
lot he put a cross against one angle
spedding knows  know he put a
cross at the apex i know that sped-
ding knows i know he marked the re-
maining angle its speddings move
and hell move damp quick

  the assistant commissioner came into
the room at that moment

  hello angel he said glancing at
the figures on the pad whats this
a new game

  its an old game said angel truth-
fully but played in an entirely new
way

esquire	

  angel was not far wrong when he
surmised that speddings move would
be immediate and although the detec-
tive had reckoned without an unknown
factor in the person of old george yet
a variety of circumstances combined to
precipitate the act that angel antici-
pated

   not least of these was the arrest of
 vinnis after his interview with old
 george spedding had decided on a
 waiting policy the old man had been
 taken to the house at clapham sped-
 ding had been prepared to wait pa-
 tiently until some freak of mind
 brought back the memory to the form
 of cryptogram he had advised a
 dozen times a day he asked the old
 man

  what is your name

   old george only old george was
the invariable reply with many grins
and noddings

	but your real name the name you
had when you were a-professor

   but this would only start the old
man off on a rambling reminiscence of
his munificent patron

   connor came secretly to clapham for
 orders it was the night after vinnis
 had been arrested

  weve got to move at once mr
connor said the lawyer connor sat
in the chair that had held jimmy a few
nights previous it is no use wait-
ing for the old man to talk the earlier
plan was best

  has anything happened asked
connor his one-time awe of the law-
yer had merged in the familiarity of
conspiratorship

   there was a detective at my office
 to-day inquiring about some notes that
 were found on vinnis angel esquire
 will draw his own conclusions and we
 have no time to lose

   we are ready said connor

   then let it be to-morrow night i
will withdraw the guard of commission-


new story magazine

 aires at the safe i can easily justify
 myself afterward

  an idea struck connor

  why not send another lot of men
to relieve them  i can fix up some of
the boys so that theyll look like com-
missionaires

  speddings eyes narrowed

  yes he said slowly it could be ar-
ranged-an excellent idea

  he paced the room with long swing-
ing strides his forehead puckered

  there are two reliefs he said one
in the morning and one in the evening
i could send a note to the sergeant of
the morning relief telling him that i
had arranged for a new set of night
men-i have changed them twice al-
ready one cannot be too careful-and i
could give you the necessary authority
to take over charge

  better still said connor instruct
him to withdraw leaving the place
empty then our arrival will attract no
notice lombard street must be used
to the commissionaires going on guard
that is an idea said spedding and
sat down to write the letter

  the night of the great project turned
out miserably wet

  so much the better muttered con-
nor viewing the world from his ken-
sington fastness the room dedicated
to the use of the master of the house
was plainly furnished and on the bare
deal table connor had set his whisky
down while he peered through the rain-
blurred windows at the streaming
streets

  england for work and egypt for
pleasure he muttered and if i get
my share of the money and it will be
a bigger share than my friend sped-
ding imagines its little this cursed
country will see of mr patrick con-
nor

  he drained off his whisky at a gulp
rubbed the steam from the windows
and looked down into the deserted

street two men were walking toward
the house one well covered by a
heavy mackintosh cloak moved with a
long stride the other wrapped in a
new overcoat shuffled by his side
quickening his steps to keep up with
his more energetic companion

  spedding said connor and old
george what is he bringing him here
for

  he hurried downstairs to let them in

  well asked spedding throwing
his reeking coat off

  alls ready answered connor
why have you brought the old man

  oh for company the lawyer an-
swered carelessly

  if the truth be told spedding still
hoped that the old man would remem-
ber that day old george had been
exceedingly garrulous almost lucidly
so at times mr spedding still held
on to the faint hope that the old mans
revelations would obviate the necessity
for employing the borough lot and
what was more important for sharing
the contents of the safe with them

  as to this latter part of the program
mr spedding had plans which would
have astonished connor had he but
known

  but old georges loquacity stopped
short at the all-important point of in-
structing the lawyer on the question of
the cryptogram he had brought him
along in the hope that at the eleventh
hour the old man would reveal his iden-
tity

  unconscious of the responsibility
that lay upon his foolish head the old
man sat in the upstairs room commun-
ing with himself

  we will leave him here said the
lawyer he will be safe

  safe enough i know him of old
hell sit here for hours amusing him-
self

  and now what about the men
asked the lawyer where do we meet
them 


angel esquire



  we shall pick them up at the cor-
ner of lombard street and theyll fol-
low me to the safe deposit

  ah

  they turned swiftly on old george
who with his chin raised and with face
alert was staring at them

  safe deposit lombard street he
mumbled and a most excellent plan
too-a most excellent plan

  the two men held their breath

  and quite an ingenious idea sir
did you say lombard street-a safe
he muttered a safe with a word
and how to conceal the word thats
the question i am a man of honor
you may trust me he made a sweep-
ing bow to  some invisible presence
why not conceal your word thus
old george stabbed the palm of his
hand with a grimy forefinger

  why not have you read my book
it is only a little book but useful sir
remarkably useful the drawings and
the signs are most accurate an emi-
nent gentleman at the british museum
assisted me in its preparation it is

called-it is called- he passed his

hand wearily over his head and slid
down into his chair again a miserable
old man muttering foolishly

  spedding wiped the perspiration
from his forehead

  nearly nearly  he said huskily
by heavens he nearly told us
connor looked at him with suspi-
cion

  whats all this about the book he
demanded this is the second time
old george has spoken like this its
to do with old reale isnt it
spedding nodded

  come said connor looking at his
watch its time we were moving
well leave the old man to look after
the house here george

  old george looked up

  youll stay here and not leave till
we return dye hear

  i hear mr connor sir said old

george with his curious assumption of
dignity and hearing obey

  as the two men turned into the night
the rain pelted down and a gusty north-
westerly wind blew into their faces

  george said connor answering a
question oh weve had him for years
one of the boys found him wandering
about limehouse with hardly any
clothes to his back and brought him to
us that was before i knew the bor-
ough lot but they used him as a blind
he was worth the money it cost to
keep him in food

  spedding kept the other waiting while
he dispatched a long telegram from the
westbourne grove post office it was
addressed to the master of the polecat
lying at cardiff and was reasonably
unintelligible to the clerk

  they found a hansom at the corner
of queens road and drove to the
bank here they alighted and crossed
to the royal exchange some men in
uniform overcoats who were standing
about exchanged glances with connor
and as the two leaders doubled back to
lombard street followed them at a
distance

  the guard left at four oclock said
spedding fitting the key of the heavy
outer door he waited a few minutes
in the inky-black darknessof the vesti-
bule while connor admitted the six uni-
formed men who had followed them

  are we all here said connor in
a low voice bat  here goyle 
here lamby here

  one by one lie called them by their
names and they answered

  we may as well have a light said
spedding and felt for the switch

  the gleam of the electric lamps
showed spedding as pure a collection
of scoundrels as ever disgraced the uni-
form of a gallant corps

  now said spedding in level tones
are all the necessary tools here

  bats grin was the answer

  if we can get an electric connec-

tion he said well burn out the lock
in half-

  spedding had walked to the inner
door that led to the great hall and was
fumbling with the keys suddenly he
started back

  hark he whispered i heard a
step in the hall

  connor listened

  i hear nothing- he began when

the inner door was thrown open aftd
a commissionaire revolver in hand
stepped out

  stand he cried then recogniz-
ing spedding dropped the muzzle of
his pistol

  white with rage spedding stood
amid his ill-assorted bodyguard in the
searching white light of the electric
lamps there was no mistaking their
character he saw the commissionaire
eying them curiously

  i understood he said slowly that
the guard had been relieved

  no sir said the man and the
cluster of uniformed men at the door
of the inner hall confirmed this

  i sent orders this afternoon said
spedding between his teeth

  no orders have been received sir
and the lawyer saw the scrutinizing eye
of the solitary sentry pass over his con-
federates

  is this the relief asked the guard
not attempting to conceal the contempt
in his tone

  yes said the lawyer

  as the sentry saluted and disappeared
into the hall spedding drew connor
aside

  this is ruin he said quickly the
safe must be cleared to-night to-mor-
row london will not hold me

  the sentry reappeared at the door-
way and beckoned them in they
shuffled into the great hall where in the
half darkness the safe loomed up from
its rocky pedestal an eerie mysterious
thing he saw bat sands glancing un-
comfortably around the dim spaces of

the building and felt the impression of
the loneliness

  a man who wore the stripes of a
sergeant came up

  are we to withdraw sir he asked

  yes said spedding shortly

  will you give us a written order
asked the man

  spedding hesitated then drew out a
pocketbook and wrote a few hasty
words on a sheet tore it out and
handed it to the man

  the sergeant looked at it carefully

  you havent signed it or dated it
either he said respectfully and handed
it back

 spedding cursed him under his
breath and rectified the omissions

  now you may go

  in the half light for only one soli-
tary electrolier illuminated the vast hall
he thought the man was smiling it
might have been a trick of the shad-
ows for he could not see his face

  and am i to leave you alone said
the sergeant

  yes

  is it safe the noncommissioned
officer asked quietly

  curse you what do you mean
cried the lawyer

  well said the other easily i see
you have connor with you a notorious
thief and blackmailer

  the lawyer was dumb

 and bat sands how dye do
bat how did they treat you in bor-
stal or was it parkhurst drawled the
sergeant and theres the gentle
lamby trying hard to look military in
an overcoat too large for him thats
not the uniform youre used to wearing
lamby eh

  from the group of men at the door
came a genuinely amused laugh

  guard the outer door one of you
chaps said the sergeant and turning
again to speddings men here we
have our respected friend curt goylo
angel esquire



  he stooped and picked up a bag that
bat had placed gingerly on the floor

  what a bag of tricks the sergeant
cooed diamond bits and dynamite
cartridges and-whats this little thing
bat-an ark it is by jove i con-
gratulate you on the swag

  spedding jiad recovered his nerve
and strode forward he was playing
for the greatest stake in the world

  you shall be punished for this in-
solence  he stormed

  not at all said the imperturbable
sergeant

  somebody at the door spoke

  heres another one sergeant and
pushed a queer old figure into the hall
a figure that blinked and peered from
face to face

  he espied spedding and ran up to
him almost fawning

 the safe deposit-in lombard
street he cackled joyously you see
i remembered dear friend and ive
come to tell you about the book-my
book you know my munificent patron
who desired a puzzle word-

  the sergeant started forward

  my god he cried the profes-
sor 

  yes yes chuckled the old man
thats what he called me he bought
a copy of my book-two sovereigns
four sovereigns he gave me the book
-what was it called

  the old man paused and clasped
both hands to his head

  a study-a study he said pain-
fully on the origin of-the alpha-
bet ah

  another of the commissionaries had
come forward as the old man began
speaking and to him the sergeant
turned

  make a note of that jimmy the
sergeant said

  spedding reeled back as though he
had been struck

  angel he gasped

  thats me was the ungrammatical
reply

  crushed cowed beaten and power-
less spedding awaited judgment what
form it would take he could not guess
that it would effectively ruin him he
did not doubt the trusted lawyer
stood self-condemned there was no
explaining away his companions there
could be no mistaking the meaning of
their presence

  send your men away said angel

  a wild hope seized the lawyer the
men were not to be arrested there was
a chance for him

  the borough lot needed no second
ordering they trooped through the
doorway anxious to reach the open air
before angel changed his mind

  you may go said angel to con-
nor who still lingered

  if the safe is to be opened im in
it was the sullen reply

  you may go said angel the safe
will not be opened to-night

  go thundered the detective and
connor slunk away

  angel beckoned the commissionaire
who had first interrogated spedding

  take charge of that bag carter
there are all sorts of things in it that
go off then he turned to the lawyer

  mr spedding there is a great deal
that i have to say to you but it would
be better to defer our conversation the
genuine guard will return in a few min-
utes i told them to return at ten
oclock

  by what authority blustered
spedding

  tush  said angel wearily surely
we have got altogether beyond that
stage your order for withdrawal was
expected by me i waited upon the
sergeant of the guard with another
order

  a forged order i gather said
spedding recovering his balance now


new story magazine

i seg why you have allowed my men
to go i overrated your generosity

  the order said angel soberly
was signed by his majestys secretary
of state for home affairs-he tapped
the astonished lawyer on the shoulder
-and if it would interest you to know
i have a warrant in my pocket for the
arrest of every man jack of you that
i do not put it into execution is a mat-
ter of policy

  the lawyer scanned the calm face of
the detective in bewilderment

  w hat do you want of me he asked
at length

  your presence at jimmys flat at ten
oclock to-morrow morning replied
angel

  i will be there said the other and
turned to go

  and mr spedding called jimmy
as the lawyer reached the door in re-
gard to a boat you have chartered from
cardiff i think you need not go any
further in the matter one of my men
is at present interviewing the captain
and pointing out to him the enormity
of the offense of carrying fugitives
from justice to spanish-american
ports

  damn you said spedcjing and
slammed the door

  jimmy removed thd commissionaires
cap from his head and grinned

  one of these fine days angel youll
lose your job introducing the home sec-
retarys name phew

  it had to be done said angel
sadly it hurts me to lie and j
couldnt very well tell spedding that
the sergeant of the commissionaires had
been one of my own men all along
could 

chapter x

some bad characters

  it happened that on the night of the
great attempt the inquisitive mr lane
of  cawdor street was considera-

bly exercised in his mind as to the de-
pleted condition of his modest treasury
with mr lane the difference between
affluence and poverty was a matter of
shillings his line of business was a
humble one lead piping and lengths
of telephone wire an occasional door-
mat improvidently left outside while
the servant cleaned the hall these rep-
resented the scope and extent of his
prey perhaps he reached his zenith
when he lifted an overcoat from a hat-
stand what time a benevolent old lady
was cutting him thick slices of bread
and butter in a basement kitchen

  mr lane had only recently returned
from a short stay in wormwood
scrubbs prison it was over a trifling
affair of horsehair abstracted from
railway carriage cushions that com-
pelled mr lanes retirement for two
months it was that same affair that
brought about his undoing on the night
of the attempt

  for the kudos of the railway theft
had nerved him to more ambitious at-
tempts and with an exhausted ex-
chequer to urge him forward and the
prestige of his recent achievements to
support him he decided upon burglary
it was a wild and reckless departure
from his regular line and he did not
stop to consider the disabilities attached
to a change of profession nor debate
the unpropitious conditions of an al-
ready overstocked labor market

  it is reasonable to suppose that mr
lane lacked the necessary qualities of
logic and balance to argue any point
to its obvious conclusion for he was
intellectually the reverse of brilliant
and was therefore ill equipped for in-
trospective or psychological examina-
tion of the circumstances leading to his
decision communing with himself the
inquisitive mr lane put the matter
tersely and brutally

  lead pipins  go unless youve got
a pal to work with telephone wires is
so covered up with wood casin that its

worsen hard work to pinch twopen-
noth im goin to have a cut at
joneses

  so in the pelting rain he watched
joneses from a convenient doorway
he noted with satisfaction the work-
men departing one by one he ob-
served with joy the going of jones
himself and when some few minutes
afterward the queer-looking old man
whom he suspected as being a sort of
caretaker came shuffling out slamming
the gate behind him and peering left
and right and mumbling to himself as
he squelched through the rain the
watcher regarded the removal of this
final difficulty as being an especial act
of providence

  he waited for another half hour be-
cause for some reason or other the
usually deserted street became annoy-
ingly crowded first came a belated
coal cart and a miserably bedraggled
carman who cried his wares dolefully
then a small boy escaping from the
confines of his domestic circle came to
revel in the downpour and wade ec-
statically but thoroughly through the
puddles that had formed on the uneven
surface of the road nemesis in the
shape of a shrill-voiced mother over-
took the boy and sent him whining and
expectant to the heavy hand of ma-
ternal authority with the coast clear
air lane lost no time

  in effecting an entrance to the head-
quarters of the borough lot mr
lanes method lacked subtlety he
climbed over the gate leading to the
yard trusting inwardly that he was not
observed but taking his chance had
he been an accomplished burglar with
the experience of any exploits behind
him he would have begun by making a
very thorough inspection of likely win-
dows certainly he would never have
tried the office door being the veri-
est tyro and being conscious more-
over that his greatest feats had con-
nection with doors carelessly left ajar

he tried the door and to his delight it
opened

  again the skilled craftsman would
have suspected some sort of treachery
and might have withdrawn but mr
lane recognizing in the fact that the
old man had forgotten to fasten the
door behind him only yet another proof
of that benevolent providence which
exerts itself for the express service of
men in luck entered boldly he lit
a candle stump and looked around

  the signs of that wealth which is the
particular possession of master men
were not evident indeed the floor of
the passage was uncarpeted and the
walls bare of picture or ornament nor
was the office a little room leading
from the passage any more prolific
of result such fixtures as there were
had apparently been left behind by the
previous tenant and these were thick
with dust

v bah said the inquisitive mr lane
scornfully and his word echoed hol-
lowly as in an empty house

  with the barren possibilities of his
exjloit before him mr lanes spirits
fell

  he was of the class to whom refer-
ence has already been made that looked
in awe and reverence toward the por-
ough lot in the same spirit as the
youthful curate might regard the con-
sistory of bishops in his cups-pew-
ter cups they were with frothing heads
atop-he was wont to boast that his
connection with the borough lot was
both close and intimate a rumor that
went around to the effect that the
mouthpiece who defended him at the
closing of the unsatisfactory horsehair
episode had been paid for by the bor-
ough lot he did not trouble to con-
tradict

  if he had known any of them even
by sight he would not at that moment
have been effecting a burglarious entry
into their premises

  room after room he searched he


new story magazine

found the ill-furnished bedroom of
connor and the room where old george
slept on an uncleanly mattress he
found too the big room where the lot
held their informal meetings but noth-
ing portable nothing that a man might
slip under his coat and walk boldly out
of the front door with no little ar-
ticle of jewelry that your wife might
carry to a pawnbrokers with a long
face and a longer story of a penury
that forced her to part with her dear
mothers last gift none of these noted
mr lane bitterly and with every fresh
disappointment he breathed the harden

  for apart from the commercial as-
pect of this his burglary there was the
sickening humiliation of failure an
imaginative man he had already in-
vented the story he was to tell to a few
select cronies in sneak-thief division
he had rehearsed mentally a scene
where with an air of nonchalance he
drew a handful of golden sovereigns
from his pocket and ordered drinks
round and while they were sipping
his drinks smirking respectfully he
would have confided to them the fact
that he had been duly and with all
ceremony installed a full-fledged mem-
ber of the borough lot

  of the irony of the situation he was
ignorant a qualified burglar would
have completed a systematic examina-
tion of the premises in ten minutes but
mr lane was not so qualified in con-
sequence he dawdled from room to
room going back to this room to make
sure and returning to that room to be
absolutely certain that nothing had been
overlooked oblivious of the flight of
time he stood irresolutely in the top-
most room of the house when the real
adventure of the evening began

  he heard the click of a lock-he had
thoughtfully closed the office door be-
hind him-and a voice and his heart
leaped into his throat he heard a
voice a voice hoarse with rage and an-
other and yet another

  mr lane realized from the stamping
of feet on the stairs that half a dozen
men had come into the house from
their language he gathered tliey were
annoyed	

  then he heard something that froze
his blood and turned his marrow to
water

  it had begun in a rumble of hoarse
undistinguishable words and ended in
the phrase that caught his ear

  hes sold us i tell ye put spies
on us he led us into the trap curse

him-

  he heard another voice speaking in
a lower tone

  what are we worth  youre a fool
what dye think were worth aint
we the borough lot dont he know
enough to hang two or three of us
its connor and his pal the big law-

  the borough lot

  the paralyzing intelligence came to
mr lane and he held on to the bare
mantelshelf for support spies sup-
pose they discovered him and mistook
him for a spy his hair rose at the
thought he knew them well enough
by repute overmuch hero worship
had invested them with qualities for
evil which they may or may not have
possessed

  there might be a chance of escape
the tumult below continued scraps
of angry talk came floating up

  mr lane looked out of the window
the drop into the street was too long
and there was no sign of rope in the
house

  cautiously he opened the door of the
room the men were in the room be-
neath that in which he stood the
staircase that led to the street must
take him past their door

  mr lane was very anxious to leave
the house he had unwittingly stepped
into a hornets nest and wanted to
make his escape without disturbing the
inmates now was the time-or never
angel esquire



while the angry argument continued
a creaking stair board or so might not
attract attention

  but he made no allowance for the
gifts of these men-gifts of sight and
hearing bat sands in the midst of his
tirade saw the uplifted finger and head
jerk of goyle he did not check his
flow of invective but edged toward the
door then he stopped short and fling-
ing the door open he caught the scared
mr lane by the throat and dragging
him into the room threw him upon the
ground and knelt on him

  what are ye doing here he whis-
pered fiercely

  mr lane with protruding eyes saw
the pitiless faces about him saw goyle
lift a life preserver from the table and
turn half round the better to strike and
fainted

  stop that growled bat with out-
stretched hand the little swine has
fainted who is he do any of you
fellers know him 

  it was the wizened-faced man whom
angel had addressed as lamby who
furnished the identification

  hes a little crook-name of lane

  where does he come from

  oh hereabouts he was in the
scrubbs in my time said lamby

  they regarded the unconscious bur-
glar in perplexity

  go through his pockets suggested
goyle

  it happened-and this was the most
providential happening of the day from
mr lanes point of view-that when
he had decided upon embarking on his
career of high-class crime he had
thoughtfully provided himself with a
few homemade instruments it was
the little poker with flattened end to
form a jimmy and the center bit that
was found in his pocket that in all
probability saved mr lanes life

  lombroso and other great criminolo-
gists have given it out that your true
degenerate has no sense of humor but

on two faces at least there was a broad
grin when the object of the little mans
visit was revealed

  he came to burgle connor said
bat admiringly here pass over the
whisky one of ye

  he forced a little down the mans
throat and mr lane blinked and
opened his eyes in a frightened stare

  stand up commanded bat an
give an account of yourself young fel-
ler what dye mean by breaking into
this--

  never mind about that goyle in-
terrupted savagely what has he
heard when he was sneaking outside
-thats the question

  nothin gentlemen gasped the un-
fortunate mr lane on me word gen-
tlemen  ive been in trouble like your-
selves an-

  he realized he had blundered

  oh said goyle with ominous
calm so youve been in trouble like
us have you

 i mean-

  i know what you mean hissed the
other you mean youve been listenin
to what weve been saying you little
skunk and youre ready to bleat to the
first copper

  it might have gone hard with mr
lane but for the opportune arrival of
the messenger bat went downstairs
at the knock and the rest stood quietly
listening they expected connor and
when his voice did not sound on the
stairs they looked at one another ques-
tioningly bat came into the room with
a yellow envelope in his hand he
passed it to goyle reading was not an
accomplishment of his goyle read it
with difficulty

  do the best you can im lying doggo 
what does that mean snarled
goyle holding the message in his hand
and looking at bat hidin is he-
and weve got to do the best we can 
bat reached for his overcoat he
did not speak as he struggled into it


new story magazine

nor until he had buttoned it deliber-
ately

  it means-git he said shortly it
means run or else it means time an
worse than time

  he swung round to the door
connors hidin he stopped to say
when connor starts hiding the place
is getting hot theres nothing against

me so far as i know except-

  his eyes fell on the form of mr
lane he had raised himself to a sit-
ting position on the floor and now with
disheveled hair and outstretched legs
he sat the picture of despair

  goyle intercepted the glance

  what about him  he asked

  leave him said bat weve got
 time for fooling with him

 a motor car came buzzing down
cawdor street which was unusual
they heard the grind of its brakes out
side the door and that in itself was suf-
ficiently alarming bat extinguished the
light and cautiously opened the shut-
ters he drew back with an oath
whats that goyle whispered

  bat made no reply and they heard
him open his match box

  what are you doing whispered
goyle fiercely

  light the lamp said the other
the tinkle of glass followed as he
removed the chimney and in the yel-
low light bat faced the borough lot

  u-p spells up an thats what the
game is he said calmly he was
searching his pockets as he spoke i
want a light because theres one or two
things in my pocket that ive got to
burn-quick 

  after some fumbling he found a pa-
per he gave it a swift examination
then he struck a match and carefully lit
the corner

its the fairest cop he went on
the streets full of police and angel
aint playing gamblin raids this time
there was a heavy knock on the
door but nobody moved goyles face

had gone livid he knew better than
any man there how impossible escape
was that had been one of the draw-
backs to the house-the ease with
which it could be surrounded he had
pointed out the fact to connor before

  again the knock

  let em open it said bat grimly
and as though the people outside had
heard the invitation the door crashed
in and there came a patter as of men
running on the stairs

  first to enter the room was angel
he nodded to bat coolly then stepped
aside to allow the policemen to follow

  i want you he said briefly

  what for asked sands

  breaking and entering said the de-
tective put out your hands

  bat obeyed as the steel stirrup-
shaped irons snapped on his wrists he
asked

  have you got connor

  angel smiled

  connor lives to fight another day
he said quietly

  the policemen who attended him
were busy with the other occupants of
the room

  bit of a field day for you mr an-
gel said the thin-faced lamby pleas-
antly thought you was goin to let
us off

  jumping at conclusibns hastily is a
habit to be deplored said angel sen-
tentiously then he saw the panic-
stricken air lane

  hullo whats this he demanded

  mr lane had at that moment the in-
spiration of his life since he was by
fortuitous circumstances involved in
this matter and since jit could make
very little difference one way or the
other what he said he seized the fame
that lay to his hand

  i am one of the borough lot he
said and was led out proud and hand-
cuffed with the knowledge that he had
established beyond dispute his title to
consideration as a desperate criminal
angel esquire



  mr spedding was a man who
thought quickly ideas and plans came
to him as dross and diamonds come to
the man at the sorting table and he had
the faculty of selection he saw the
police system of england as only the
police themselves saw it and he had an
open mind upon angels action it was
within the bounds of possibility that
angel had acted with full authority it
was equally possible that angel was
bluffing

  mr spedding had two courses be-
fore him and they were both desper-
ate  but he must be sure in how so far
his immediate liberty depended upon
the whim of a deputy assistant commis-
sioner of police

  angel had mentioned a supreme au-
thority it was characteristic of sped-
ding that he should walk into a mine
to see how far the fuse had burned in
other words he hailed the first cab and
drove to the house of commons

  the right honorable george chan-
dler middleborough his majestys sec-
retary of state for home affairs is a
notoriously inaccessible man but he
makes exceptions and such an excep-
tion he made in favor of spedding
for eminent solicitors do not come
down to the house at ten oclock in the
evening to gratify an idle curiosity or
to be shown over the house or beg
patronage and interest and when a
business card is marked most urgent
and that card stands for a staple repre-
sentative of an important profession
the request for an interview is not
easily refused

  spedding was shown into the minis-
ters room and the home secretary rose
with a smile he knew mr spedding
by sight and had once dined in his
company

  er- he began looking at the

card in his hand what can i do for
you-at this hour he smiled again

i have called to see you in the mat-
ter of the late mr reale he saw

and watched the ministers face be-
yond looking a little puzzled tie home
secretary made no sign

  good thought spedding and
breathed with more freedom

  im afraid- said the minister

he got no farther for spedding was at
once humility apology and embarrass-
ment

  what had the home secretary not
received his letter a letter dealing
with the estate of reale you can im-
agine the distress and vexation on mr
speddings face as he spoke of the
criminal carelessness of his clerk his
attitude of helplessness his recognition
of the absolute impossibility of discuss-
ing the matter until the secretary had
received the letter and his withdrawal
leaving behind him a sympathetic min-
ister of state who would have been
pleased-would have been delighted
my dear sir to have helped mr sped-
ding if hed received the letter in time
to consider its contents mr spedding
was an inventive genius and it might
have been in reference to him that the
motherhood of invention was first iden-
tified with dire necessity

  out again in the courtyard spedding
found a cab that car-ied him to his
club

  angel bluffed he reflected with
an inward smile my friend you are
risking that nice appointment of yours

  he smiled again for it occurred to
him that his risk was the greater

  two millions he murmured it
is worth it i could do a great deal
with two millions

  he got down at his club and ten-
dered the cabman the legal fare to a
penny

chapter xi

the quest of the book

  when piccadilly circus a blaze of
light was thronged with the crowds
that the theaters were discharging a
motor car came gingerly through the


new story magazine

traffic passed down regent street and
swinging along pall mall headed
southward across westminster bridge

  the rain had ceased but underfoot
the roads were soddened and the car
bespattered its occupants with black
mud

  the chauffeur at the wheel turned as
the car ran smoothly along the tram-
way lines in the old kent road and
asked a question and one of the two
men in the back of the car consulted
the other

  we will go to cramers first said
the man

  old kent road was a fleeting vision
of closed shops of little knots of men
emerging from public houses at the
potmans strident command lewisham
high road as befits that very respect-
able thoroughfare was decorously
sleeping lea where the hedges begin
was silent and chislehurst was a
place of the dead

  near the common the car pulled up
at a big house standing in black quiet-
ude and the two occupants of the car
descended and passed through the stiff
gate along the graveled path and came
to a stop at the broad porch

  i dont know what old mauder will
say said angel as he fumbled for the
bell hes a methodical old chap

  in the silence they could hear the
thrill of the electric bell they waited
a few minutes and rang again then
they heard a window opened and a
sleepy voice demand

  who is there

  angel stepped back from the porch
and looked up

  hullo mauder i want you im
angel

  the devil said a surprised voice
wait a bit ill be down in a jiffy

  the pleasant-faced man who in
dressing gown and pajamas opened the
door to them and conducted them to a
cozy library was mr ernest mauder
himself it is unnecessary to introduce

that world-famous publisher to the
reader the more particularly in view
of the storm of controversy that burst
about his robust figure in regard to the
recent publication of count lehoffs
embarrassing memoirs he made a
sign to the two men to be seated nod-
ding to jimmy as to an old friend

   am awfully sorry to disturb you
at this rotten hour angl commenced
and the other arrested his apology with
a gesture

  you detective people are so fond of
springing surprises on us unintelligent
outsiders he said with a twinkle in
his eye that i am almost tempted to
startle you

  it takes a lot to startle me said
angel complacently

  youve brought it on your own
head warned the publisher wagging
a forefinger at the smiling angel
now let me tell you why you have
motored down from london on this
miserable night on a fairly fruitless
errand

  eh the smile left angels face
ah i thought that would startle
you youve come about a book
yes said jimmy wonderingly

  a book published by our people
nine years ago

  yes the wonderment deepening on
the faces of the two men

  the title said the publisher im-
pressively is a short study on the
origin of the alphabet and the au-
thor is a half-mad old don who was
subsequently turned out of oxford for
drunkenness

  mauder said jimmy gazing at his
host in bewilderment youve hit it-
but-

  ah said the publisher triumphant
i thought that was it well your
search is fruitless we only printed
five hundred copies the book was a
failure-the same ground was more ef-
fectively covered by better books i
found a dusty old copy a few years
angel esquire



ago and gave it to my secretary so
far as i know that is the only copy in
existence

  but your secretary said angel
eagerly what is his name where
does he live

  its not a he  said mauder but
a she 

  her name

  if you had asked that question ear-
lier in the evening  ccyild not have told
you said mauder obviously enjoying
the mystery he had created but since
then my memory has been refreshed
the girl-and a most charming lady
too-was my secretary for two years
i do not know what induced her to
work but i rather think she supported
an invalid father

  what is her name asked angel
impatiently

  kathleen kent replied the pub-
lisher and her address is-

  kathleen kent repeated jimmy
in wide-eyed astonishment angels
and ministers of grace defend us
kathleen kent repeated angel
with a gasp well that takes the
everlasting biscuit but he added
quickly how did you come to know of
our errand 

  well drawled the elder man
wrapping his dressing gown round him
more snugly it was a guess to an ex-
tent you see angel when a man has
been already awakened out of a sound
sleep to answer mysterious inquiries
about an out-of-date book--

  what cried jimmy jumping up
somebody has already been here
it is only natural the publisher
went on to connect his errand with
that of the second midnight intruder
who has been here for heavens
sakedont be funny this is a serious
business

  nobody has been here said mau-
der but an hour ago a man called me

up on the telephone-

    

  jimmy looked at angel and angel
looked at jimmy

  jimmy said angel penitently
write me down as a fool telephone
heavens i didnt know you were con-
nected

  nor was i till last week said the
publisher nor will i be after to-mor-
row sleep is too precious a gift to be
dissipated-

  who was the man demanded an-
gel

  i couldnt quite catch his name he
was very apologetic i gathered that
he was a newspaper man and wanted
particulars in connection with the death
of the author

  angel smiled

  the authors alive all right he said
grimly how did the voice sound-
a little pompous with a clearing of the
throat before each sentence

  the other nodded

  spedding said angel rising we
havent any time to lose jimmy

  mauder accompanied them into the
hall

  one question said jimmy as lie
fastened thecollar of his motor coat
can you give us any idea of the con-
tents of the book

  i cant was the reply i have a
dim recollection that much of it was
purely conventional that there were
some rough drawings and the earlier
forms of the alphabet were illustrated
-the sort of thing you find in encyclo-
pedias or in the back pages of teachers
bibles

  the two men took their seats in the
car as it swung round and turned its
bright head lamps toward london

i found this puzzle in a book

from which some mighty truths were took

murmured angel in his companions
ear and jimmy nodded he was at
that moment utterly oblivious and care-
less of the fortune that awaited them in
the great safe at lombard street his
mind was filled with anxiety concern-


new story magazine

itig the girl who unconsciously held the
word which might to-morrow make her
an heiress spedding had moved
promptly and lie would be aided he
did not doubt by connor and the ruf-
fians of the borough lot if the book
was still in the girls possession they
would have it and they would make
their attempt at once

  his mind was full of dark forebod-
ings and although the car bounded
through the night at full speed and
the rain which had commenced to fall
again cut his face and the momentum
of the powerful machine took his
breath away it went all too slowly for
his mood

  one incident relieved the monotony
of the journey as the car flew round
a corner in an exceptionally narrow
lane it almost crashed into another car
which driven at breakneck speed was
coming in the opposite direction a
fleeting exchange of curses between the
chauffeurs and the cars passed

  by common consent they had headed
for kathleens home streatham was
deserted as they turned the corner
of the quiet road in which the girl
lived angel stopped the car and
alighted he lifted one of the huge
lamps from the socket and examined
the road

  there has been a car here less than
half an hour ago he said pointing to
the unmistakable track of wheels they
led to the door of the house

  he rang the bell and it was almost
immediately answered by an elderly
lady who wrapped in a loose dressing
gown bade him enter

  nobody seems to be surprised to see
us to-night thought angel with bitter
humor

  i am detective angel from scot-
land yard he announced himself and
the elderly lady seemed unimpressed

  kathleen has gone she informed
him cheerfully

  jimmy heard her with a sinking at
his heart

  yes said the old lady mr sped-
ding the eminent solicitor called for
her an hour ago and-she grew con-
fidential-as i know you gentlemen
are very much interested in the case i
may say that there is every hope that
before to-morrow my niece will be in
possession of her fortune

  jimmy groaned

  please go on said angel

  it came about over a book which
kathleen had given her some years
ago and which most assuredly would
have been lost but for my carefulness
jimmy cursed her carefulness un-
der his breath

  when we moved here after the
death of kathleens poor father i had a
great number of things stored there
were among these an immense quantity
of books which kathleen would have

sold but which i thought-

  where are these stored asked an-
gel quickly

  at an old property of ours-the only
property my poor brother had remain-
ing she replied sadly and that be-
cause it was in too dilapidated a condi-
tion to attract buyers

  where where angel realized
the rudeness of his impatience for-
give me madam he said but it is
absolutely necessary that i should fol-
low your niece at once

  it is on the tonbridge road she
answered stiffly so far as i can re-
member it is somewhere between
crawley and tonbridge but i am not
sure kathleen knows the place well
that is why she has gone

 somewhere on the tonbridge
road repeated angel helplessly

  we could follow the cars tracks
said jimmy

  angel shook his head

  if this rain is general they will be
obliterated he replied

  they stood a minute jimmy biting
angel esquire



the soddened linger of his glove and
angel staring into vacancy then
jimmy demanded unexpectedly
have you a bible

  the old lady allowed the astonish-
ment she felt at the question to be ap-
parent

  i have several

  a teachers bible with notes he
asked

  she thought

  yes there is such a one in the
house will you wait

  she left the room

  we should have told the girl about
spedding-we should have told her
said angel in despair

  its  use crying over spilled milk
said jimmy quietly the thing to do
now is to frustrate spedding and res-
cue the girl

 will he dare-

  hell dare oh yes liell dare
said jimmy hes worse than you
think angel

  but he is already a ruined man
the more reason why he should go
a step farther hes been on the verge
of ruin for months ive found that
out i made inquiries the other day
and discovered hes in a hole that the
dome of st pauls wouldnt fill hes
a trustee or something of the sort for
an association that has been pressing
him for money spedding will dare
anything-he paused then-but if lie

dares to harm that girl lies a dead
man

  the old lady came in at that moment
with the book and jimmy hastily
turned over the pages

  near the end he came upon some-
thing that brought a gleam to his eye

  he thrust his hand into his pocket
and drew out a notebook he did not
wait to pull up a chair but sank on his
knees by the side of the table and wrote
rapidly comparing the text with the
drawings in the book

  angel leaning over followed the
work breathlessly

 there-and there-and there
cried angel exultantly what fools
we were jimmy what fools we were

  jimmy turned to the lady

  may i borrow this book he asked
it will be returned thank you
now angel he looked at his watch
and made a move for the door we
have two hours we will take the ton-
bridge road by daybreak

  only one other person did they dis-
turb on that eventful night and that
was a peppery old colonel of marine
who lives at blackheath

  there before the hastily attired old
officer as the dawn broke angel ex-
plained his mission and writing with
feverish haste subscribed to the writ-
ten statement by oath whereupon the
justice of the peace issued a warrant
for the arrest of joseph james sped-
ding solicitor on a charge of felony

strange doings 

of-

 by charles s siegrist 


ih a ert

dop mcclung slowly drew the
big mitt from his hand and slapped
it enthusiastically toward the players
bench nodding brief dismissal to the
blond young giant who had been pitch-
ing to him for the last half hour

  going a bit better to-day quinnie
he called good-humoredly his ready
sympathy reading the hunger for en-
couragement in the youngsters eyes
he turned around- smiling at scrappy
bill joslin the peppery manager of
the high rollers

  well pop began the manager
scratching his head thoughtfully
theres one bush leaguer that beats me
i thought id wised up to all there was
to know about baseball but i never
saw such class drop out of the clouds
before that kid quinlan has speed
to burn curves control and a spitter
that will make crab wagner break
his back reaching for it

  yes-s-s hesitatingly agreed the old-
timer hes got everything that any
portsider ever had-so far as we know
now question is has he got nerve
can he stand the gaff

  only putting him under fire will
show that if he falls down that will
explain why we never heard of him
before and the can for his joslin
started to move toward the plate where
kincade veteran right-hander of the
pitching staff was fungo batting to a
horde of ambitious recruits in the field
pop mcclung stopped him

  i aint so certain that even that
will tell he began i remember cy
murphy-he was before your time
scrappy-got sent back to the minors
three years before i gave him a reg-
ular chance that was fifteen years
ago when i managed the canaries he
had everything a ball player could want
and fielded his position as well as he
batted which was three hundred or
thereabouts but somehow every time
he went in the box he blew up-had
everything but just naturally blew up
a mile i tried him out in six games
before benching him still i wasnt
satisfied that he was yellow i sent
out a scout to the towns where hed
worked before and they made reports
to me

  then  saw what was behind it all
murphy was so blamed miserly that the
fear of losing the fat salary he made
in the big circuit had got him so scart
he couldnt do a thing i called him
into my room one night and put it
up to him-told him what i knew
then i went after him i made a
regular spendthrift out of murphy
made him spend money to hang on to
his job it was like pulling teeth but
he figured out that even the way it
flew he was making more than he
would in the minors well scrappy
it made murphy the finest pitcher ive
ever worked with

meaning that young quinlan is a
miser queried the manager smiling
the strange doings of mister quinlan



broadly he knew the deep insight into
human nature which pop mcclung had
gained through his wanderings his in-
timate associations with men and loved
him for the quality quite as much as
for his whole-souled nature

  if money was blood slowly an-
swered the old-time coach you could
scratch this young fellow clean to the
heart and not draw a drop if youd
step on a wad of chewing gum scrappy
it wouldnt be half as close to your
shoe as quinlan is about money

  joslin shook his head darkly

  keep it under your bonnet pop
he warned the kid might be sensi-
tive about it and you know how the
fellows josh-especially a live bunch
like the high rollers gee theyll be
sore as turpentined pups when they

find it out and then- he

groaned aloud when royce gets on
the coaching line for the bears and be-
gins handing out some of his rough
stuff to quinlan about money matters
that kidll go up in the air so far hell
have a peck of stars in his mitts when
lie comes down

  lies proud of it groaned the old
man

  joslin looked at him incredulously
then turned toward the bench here
was something totally beyond his ken
from the ground up he knew ball
players twelve years he had been in
the business and as is necessary with
a successful manager half his duties
consisted of gaining insight into char-
acter he could not understand the
double phenomenon of a mans being
stingy and at the same time rejoicing
in it while ball players as a rule
are rather a saving lot of men the
high rollers-as the name implied-
were the exception to the rule still
pop mcclung knew more about men
than he he watched the practice
closely but his eyes were really upon
the handsome young fellow beside him
studying ponderingjhe problem of how

  to fit his personality into that of the
high rollers

  difficult mafter that considering that
he knew absolutely nothing regarding
the young chap as a general thing
the ball player with merit sufficient to
draw even a second thought from the
big-league manager is heralded from
one end of the country to the other
clubs engage at big salaries scouts to
scour the united states for talent no
hamlet too insignificant no tale too thin
to draw one of these argus-eyed men
thousands of miles to watch a so-called
comer work

  and at the end of the season if
all the scouts have landed one man
with ability enough to gain a bare try-
out in spring training they have done
well and their salaries are more than
earned all this for even an outfielder
pitchers the brahmans of baseball are
scarcely ever picked up except at tre-
mejideus expense

  now this young quinlan had never
been heard of before he had dropped
into long horn while the high rollers
were beginning their spring training to
get the regulars into shape and the re-
cruits a chance to show the stuff they
were made of one thing was certain
-he had unlimited nerve in the lobby
of the little texas hotel he had braced
scrappy bill joslin and asked for a
chance to work

  it was the best card of introduction
he could have produced joslin loved
nerve and this was something more
than nerve-pure unadulterated gall it
was for any man to imagine he stood
a show to get on the pay roll of the
high rollers always winning or scrap-
ping it out for the pennant in the big-
gest league of them all laughingly
joslin had consented he ceased to
laugh when pop mcclung reported to
him that night not only was the
youngster worthy of a show but
seemed likely to win a place on the
team joslin kept his weather eye


new story magazine

peeled the following day scanning the
volunteer recruits work keenly search-
ingly

  it was impossible that this fellow
could be of big-league stuff yet as
he watched admiringly the easy wind-up
and delivery saw the tremendous force
of leg stomach and arm muscle that
went into the toss heard the thud of
pops big mitt and the old mans grunt
he knew that mcclung had not been
overly enthusiastic about this chap

  then with the same easy motion
the same apparently tremendous force
quinlan loosed a slow one it floated
up shoulder high and joslin fancied
he could count the seams upon the balls
brown surface so lazily slow was it
in swift bewildering succession fol-
lowed sharp short snappy curves and
two spitballs that zigzagged crazily
down into the ground one of them
eluding the agile mitt of the catcher
and barking his shins control was
quinlans middle name even though
his first was jack never in early
season had mcclung seen such perfect
work

  perhaps he reasoned this brilliant
showing seemed so fine to him because
the old-timers were only tossing the
ball about easily limbering their pre-
cious muscles and ligaments up grad-
ually he watched for a week and
jack quinlans constant improvement
convinced him finally that pop was
right a miracle had happened a
star left-handed pitcher had dropped
into his hands from the skies

  the correspondents soon caught on
to the interest he showed in young
quinlan and gave that gentleman their
undivided attention there were col-
umns written about him the gor-
geously fine news mystery of the month
but it brought no information regard-
ing the mystery himself quinlan
might have been born from the bowels
of the earth for all the news these
papers brought out and then the

stories took new shape the corre-
spondents saw that this youngster was
not only a great storv but a great
pitcher as well-that he appeared to
have won a berth with the wonderful
high rollers

  and all this retrospection was run-
ning through the managers mind as
from the tail of his eye he studied his
find young handsome as a greek god
gentle looking and good-natured it did
not seem possible that miserliness could
be the weakness in his nature yet
some flaw there surely must be no
man could be all that jack quinlan had
showed himself in the pitching line and
not have some grievous fault joslin
leaned over

  hows the whip son he ques-
tioned

  the young chaps eyes brightened
affably while a splendid smile parted
his lips as he rubbed his south arm
swelling the biceps

  getting loosened up every day he
responded cheerily i dont get half
enough work mr joslin

  the manager grunted

  youre working too hard run
around the park three times and then
go to the hotel

  with slow chagrin the recruit rose
and trotted obediently about the ball
park he did not shirk allowing his
long splendid legs to stretch far out
in a sprinters stride he was cer-
tainly more than full of pepper thought
joslin as he turned his attention to the
other players still there must be
something wrong there must be

  that night at dinner the topic of
conversation revolved about the annual
ball which the players gave the towns-
people for the entertainment so lav-
ishly showered upon them throughout
their stay it was the big event of
long horn and the players enjoyed it
more than the guests themselves as
their name implied the high rollers
never did anything by halves not a
the strange doings of mister quinlan



dissipated lot of men they still believed
in enjoying themselves to the utmost
and joslin approved of most of their
sport arguing that it kept them from
going stale getting nervous and irri-
table during the hot train rides and the
strain and stress of a driving season
on the diamond he suddenly noticed
young quinlans face drop as the sub-
ject of expense arose he determined
to see what there was to pops surmise
of the afternoon

  hat over his eyes he squatted in a
big lobby chair after the meal appar-
ently dozing in reality his little black
eyes never left the face of the young
twirler high pockets jennings of
all men the most persuasive and good-
natured emerged from a clump of
eager players notebook and pencil in
hand he stopped beside the manager
and whispered

  how much kill for the ball im
putting you down hard

  call it a century high shortly
answered the manager ignoring his pet
infielders warm thanks he was watch-
ing the eager way with which quinlan
rose from a near-by chair and started
toward the stairs jennings saw him
going and started in pursuit but jos-
lins voice rang out commandingly

  quinlan  step here a second 

  hand me your book high he cried
sharply to jennings then waited while
the new pitcher approached his jaw
thrust forward pugnaciously

  quinlan he began slowly his tone
pleasant but his teeth snapping down
on the words in the way which all big
leaguers knew meant trouble or antic-
ipated trouble being a new man you
probably dont know of a custom we
have had for the last five years of giv-
ing a hop to the people of long horn 
to show our appreciation of the en-
tertainment and good feeling they al-
ways exhibit toward us

  jennings is taking up a subscription
now as you may not have the ready

cash im asking myself what you want
to subscribe im giving a hundred
bucks but of course i represent the
owners and give more than the boys
he lifted his eyes inquiringly wonder-
ing at the black look disappearing so
quickly

  it is embarrassing mr joslin
glibly answered the young pitcher
you see i took a big chance coming
down here you consented to pay my
board and room rent and thats kept
you from knowing what a hole ive
been in as a matter of fact im
strapped-flat broke

  i might advance you something
suggested joslin his jaws tightening
i think ill carry you a few weeks
anyhow quinlan until i have to de-
cide whom to drop from the roster
ill be under contract-salaried
then 

  sure say a couple of hundred a
month

  quinlan shook his head decidedly
not for me mr joslin i want
real money to play with the high
rollers why i know that alberts gets

eight thousand a year for-

  never mind what alberts gets
were not talking contracts now im
spieling a little song and dance about
this ball of the high rollers youve
been at the town dances youvv called
on some of these people and enjoyed
their hospitality in many ways how
much do you want me to loan you
on my salary you mean  quin-
lans eyes narrowed at the corners and
a cunning expression played about his
mouth

  certainly joslin impatiently re-
sponded ill deduct it from the first
months envelope

  well you see mr joslin hesitat-
ingly began the pitcher its this way
with me you talk about a measly two
hundred dollars a month and i might
be led into doing something which
would bind me-


new story magazine

  joslins teeth snapped together with
a distinctly audible click if there was
one thing for which he was noted more
than another it was the square dealings
he had with his men no one had
ever complained of ill treatment from
scrappy bill and he had enemies by
the score-exclusive of umpires

  never mind about that talk he
grated youve got money quinlan
and i know it ive seen you haul out
a roll of bills when you paid for your
laundry now im trying to do the
decent thing do you want to con-
tribute to pay back for what youve
received 

  no i dont want to as shortly an-
swered the left-hander i didnt ask
for any hospitality and didnt figure on
a come-back or i would never have ac-
cepted it you can just count me out

  i didnt ask you to practice with
the high rollers either snarled jos-
lin but i was willing to give you a
chance

  and i showed you something youd
be willing to pay five thousand dollars
for didnt i  quinlan laughed and
half turned on his heel im not ask-
ing any favors and i dont expect any
if i get a berth with the high rollers
it will be because im worth having
along

  scrappy bill stared in speechless
amazement at the broad back of this
youngster who talked to him as no one
had dared talk for many years by
a mighty effort of will he curbed his
tongue after all he owed it to his
own employers to give them his best
to save them the thousands which this
boy would earn for them he himself
was merely a cog in a machine when
it came to this team and no enmity
could arise between inanimate things
jennings who had been listening inter-
estedly started to address him but the
expression on scrappy bills face for-
bade conversation the popular player
hustled out on the veranda to gossip

 about this astonishing conversation to
 the other players while joslin sought
 out pop mcclung

   the effects of what joslin had to
 tell and what jennings had to tell were
 soon apparent the veteran coach who
 was carried along at a good salary
 merely to coach youngsters in the finer
 art of the game and because of his mas-
 terly handling of any situation involv-
 ing kinks in human nature listened to
 the manager gravely and nodded his
 wise old head then he started to talk
 things over with quinlan hoping to
 show him how impossible it was to
 get along with his fellows to get the
 best out of himself when the men were
 against him should he continue to
 hoard his every dollar on the other
 hand the men began to look for traits
 of miserliness in the recruit whom they
 felt sure by now would be a regular
 during the coming season

   the high rollers found exactly what
  they were looking for and that by no
 very strenuous effort quinlan was
 mean niggardly a-hoarder of wealth

   and to think groaned little josh
 reynard who sported more diamonds
 than were ever seen before outside of
 a pawnshop window that his first
 name is jack and a mistr has crept into
 the high rollers wowic and likewise
 zowie cant you hear royce opening
 up on the coaching lines when he gets
 wise to this quinlan person cant
 you just hear the bleachers out at the
 bears grounds getting wise to the
 royce line of spiel and passing it out
 to me there in the sun field oh
 wow wow wow theyll change
 the name of the high rollers to short
 skates im going to ask to be re-
 leased to kalamazoo because it sounds
 like mazuma

   and little josh knew whereof he
 spoke the high rollers and the
 bears always bitterest of rivals clashed
 over the temperament of jack quinlan
 royces brilliant invective against the
the strange doings of mister quinlan



meanness of the young left-hander was
passed on throughout the league had
the lad been with any other organiza-
tion than the high rollers it would
not have been so bad there were the
benedicts all married whose wives col-
lected their pay envelopes and there
were the bachelors who yearned for
married life and hoarded against the
happy day and there were the crabs
with four notoriously stingy men
on their roster-quinlans disposition
would not have stood out so fiamingly
with any of the three but to have
such a one with joslins spenders-that
was a little over the limit

  but quinlan was carried with the
team quite as every one had prophe-
sied everything he had save ability
to get in the box and deliver the goods
joslin rather gladly decided that the
roasting the lad received from players
and fans about the circuit had gotten
his nerve but somehow when he
stood behind old pop and watched the
youngster warm up before games his
intelligence could not find it in his
heart to release him

  one game-two games-three games
jack quinlan lost in rapid succession
in the last essay he faced the bears
with nothing but a glove and a prayer
joslin nudged old mcclung in the ribs

  pop he whispered theres noth-
ing to it ive got to drop this young
whirlwind he hasnt got nerve

  the old man shook his head dis-
sentingly

  hes all there scrappy take it
from me hell be a sensation when he
hits his stride remember what i told
you bout murphy-

  joslin laughed impatiently and trotted
out to the coaching line he could not
understand the situation and it irritated
him already the president of the club
was asking why in the world he carried
such a supine failure further and there
appeared ho answer rarely if ever
before had mr collins interfered or

questioned his judgment of a ball
player but three games lost in a row
by a beginner had caused that gentle-
man considerable worry about the state
of scrappy bills mind

  the evening after that third defeat
pop mcclung took the left-hander off
in a corner of the lobby his good-hu-
mored face very serious

  quinnie he said i want to have
a talk with you where no one who
knows us can overhear the boys are
all watching us now and theyre sore
at your pitching to-day how about
the theater to-night

  quinlans face lightened with the
boyish expression which always tugged
at the old ball players heart there
was something so frankly ingenuous
so delightfully unselfish about that look
he could never believe what he knew
to be true about the pitchers trait of
miserliness

  it put him in good humor all through
the walk quinlan chatted-boyish de-
light at the outing evidently the first
he had enjoyed for a long time in
the line before the box office pop
waited creeping slowly forward till he
was almost in front of the ticket win-
dow then he thrust his hand into his
pocket withdrawing it quickly an ex-
pression of dismay upon his ruddy
features

  well whatta you think of that he
laughed ruefully to quinlan i left
my money in my other pocket quin-
nie 

  the southpaws face set in stern
sad lines

  gee he muttered thats a
shame i wanted to see this show
pretty bad

  even knowing the young fellow as
he did pop stared at him incredulously
for a second no there was no symp-
tom of his hand reaching toward his
own pocket to amend the blunder there
was nothing on his face but regret at
being obliged to miss the performance


new story magazine

within the treasurer was glaring im-
patiently at the old catcher as he held
up the line no chance now to dis-
cover suddenly that he had his roll with
him there was nothing to it save mut-
ter an excuse about forgetting his
money and drop out of the line

  bubbling over with a rage he could
not easily repress he wandered out into
the night once he glanced up into
quinlans face the young man met
his eyes reproachfully

  a man your age ought to be more
careful pop he warned seriously
no telling wholl get into your room
while your away i always make it
a point to carry my money with me
nix on the banks and that sort of
thing for me he slapped his breast
pocket gleefully and then pop flamed

  you mean to tell me that you admit
youve got money with you and still
let me stand like a hick in that line
explaining to a frozen-faced snipe that
i havent got the price of a brace of
seats he demanded now see here
quinlan-he halted squarely in the
middle of the hurrying throng and
faced the left-hander thats what i
come out to talk over with you i
know whats ailing you-youre so
scairt of losing your job that you
havent the nerve to pitch ball joslin
has made up his mind to let you go
mr collins for the first time since he
made scrappy bill manager of the high
rollers is sore and demands that you
go back to the bush

  i claimed that you could deliver
goods that were all wool and a yard
wide but youve got to get over this
nervousness about that sweet salary of
yours or first thing you know youll
be earning nothing one more chance
for you son and thats the end youll
go from the high rollers stamped as
the quitter wbo didnt make good even
when given the finest trial any young-
ster ever received

  quinlan suddenly held out his hand

with an impulsive gesture it was the
first time he had made any advance of
friendship toward one of his fellows
and from the hungry look in his eyes
the old-timer knew that he had long
been yearning for a bit of companion-
ship slowly he took the hand and
clasped it firmly

  i understand a little bit son he
said slowly theres something about
you i like even if you do beat hell for
stinginess but remember i cant do
any more for you than get you this
last chance thats straight

  the next two days young quinlan
sat on the bench biting his nails in
intense nervousness then he began
to brace up his jaw squared into an
obstinate expression while the eyes lost
their worried expression the fourth
day he approached joslin and requested
that he be allowed to take a turn in
the box

  im right mr joslin he said diffi-
dently i just want one more chance
and if i get it at the time when i feel
as i do now i think everything will
be-o k for the rest of the season

 and that was the start of the string
of fifteen straight victories that set the
country wild with excitement the
name of quinlan became a byword
no odds how brutally he was assailed
by the coaches no matter what execra-
tion was heaped upon his head quin-
lan went into the box and came forth
with another scalp hanging to his belt
he appeared invincible

  but not even this could endear him
to his teammates it is a curious thing
on a baseball team that the members
may be the worst enemies off the field
and yet work in perfect harmony on it
quinlan might have remained stingy
during that string and been an idol with
the high rollers but the only effect
his success appeared to have upon him
was to make the disagreeable trait
worse than ever

  and he celebrated his tenth victory
the strange doings of mister quinlan



by going to joslin and demanding a
bonus for every victory as the terms
of his contract had been very loose in
the beginning scrappy bill had an
extremely difficult time forcing him to
remain satisfied everything pertaining
to money he seemed to know about in-
tuitively did joslin bring forth the
bugaboo of banishment from big-league
circles ouinlan only laughed and
pointed out that he was clean living and
too much of a drawing card to remain
un forgiven long by the magnates yes
quinlan knew his worth and tried hard
to xact his pound of flesh

  then came the two affairs which
threatened to cause a strike among ihe
high rollers the pair of events which
made them ready to stop playing ball
with such a man

  old pop whose eye was getting a bit
hazier every day misjudged the spitter
of a youngster he was trying to break
in with the result that he was laid off
permanently sentiment does not per-
mit of a teams carrying any dead wood
a subscription was immediately taken
up among the players of not only the
high rollers but from members of
other teams who cared to contribute
quinlan refused point-blank to come in

  pop should have seen this coming
long ago he declared stubbornly i
told him that he was a dead one and
ought to put a few dollars aside but
he laughed at me i tried my best to
help him-

  help him howled jennings wildly
you help pop why pop taught you
all you know of the fine points of pitch-
ing pop kept you on the team when
collins was after joslin for hanging
onto you you help pop with advice
ive a great mind to kick-

  quinlans teeth closed with a click
his eyes flamed brilliantly then turn-
ing abruptly on his heel he walked
away head high step firm suddenly
he turned back

  as a matter of fact fellows he

announced a glint of laughter in his
handsome eyes i havent got a red
cent to-day ive been buying a little
option maybe youll knoy me better
to-morrow

  i hope not muttered jennings
aloud

  vain hope the next afternoon in
the clubhouse while the men were sit-
ting about discussing the merits of little
joshs diamonds the door burst open
and limpy stearns hobbled into their
midst for years limpy had rented
the peanut and soft-drink privilege in
the stands of the high rollers grounds
his affliction coupled with a cheery
nature had made him a prime favorite
with all the players as did also his
unswerving devotion to the team but
there was no cheerfulness about his ap-
pearance now as he stood there glar-
ing about the room his eyes fastened
upon the splendid figure of jack
quinlan

  thats the guy he howled ex-
citedly his eyes blazing with rage as
he pointed a quivering finger at the in-
differently smiling young giant thats
the guy what done me up

  done you up limpy  questioned
little josh reynard quickly what do
you mean by that stuff-doing you
up

 he skinned me when i wasnt
lookin wailed the cripple

  come on limpy urged jennings
stepping forward put a straight one
right in the groove waist high and
maybe well get you

  still beefing about that seven-thou-
sand-dollar smear limpy grinned
young quinlan tantalizingly

  for a second limpy choked with
rage then he whirled out the words as
though from a machine gun

  yesterday my option expired for
sellin soft stuff in the park i thought
everything would be all right all right
so i waits till to-day to hop round and
see mr collins an whatta you tink


new story magazine

dat quinlan guy had done hed tied
up that contract by planking down his
salary for the rest of the season and
some cash an now hes holdin me up
for a seven-thousand-dollar increase
isnt that cheap limpy queried
quinlan teasingly

  cheap-cheap limpy broke down
tears pouring from his eyes its so
cheap that ill have t go t work meself
and lay two boys off to come out on
th season

  well anyhow you make a living
lightly responded the portside twirler
then to the astounded players so
long fellows ive got a little date at
the gate with a friend of mine i told
you i didnt liave a penny yesterday
some day youll begin to understand
me

  he flipped his hand lightly his face
fairly beaming with innocent good hu-
mor absolutely unconscious of the
scorn on his fellow players faces as he
passed out the door talk broke loose
flooded little joshwas delegated by
the men to talk with quinlan imme-
diately and force him to make easy
terms with the cripple then they
waited while the left fielder chased out
to the gate

  did you hand it to him limpy
queried the sympathetic jennings

  mr collins said he was sorry but
business was business moaned the
privilege man there wasnt nothin
much fer a guy like me to do so i
asked him to pay it over to quinlan
for me and id turn it back as it came
in gee whatta you think of a guys
doing that t turn seven thousand dol-
lars 

  seven thousand dollars muttered
larkin wonderingly why that fel-
low was broke at long horn this
spring and now hes got ten thousand
dollars if hes got a cent i didnt know
there was that much money in the
world

  and robbing a cripple-

  dont it beat hell

  -id like t-

  the storm of anathemas was inter-
rupted by the breathless reentrance of
josh reynard his eyes popping wide
with information

  did you see him-bawl him out
did i see him josh drew himself
proudly up to his five feet four inches
of height see him i should guess
yes there isnt any missing him hes
gone clean off his nut quinlan was
standing at the gate buying roses for
the swellest skirt youve ever lamped-
buying roses and paying for em with
ten-dollar bills and not takin the change
i hope im something of a gentleman
sometimes but when it came t look-
ing on and seeing limpys coin go that
direction i turned loose of a line of
talk tliat would make scrappy bill jos-
lin sound like he was tongue-tied
what did he say-do demanded
the players

  grinned at th skirt groaned josh
dolefully just grinned and says to
her this is our sun fielder little josh
im a pitcher they say but it dont
pay half so good as robbing cripples
and then-and then they both laughs
and talks knv and i see it aint no use
trying to puncture his hide so i beats
it back 

  buying roses with ten-dollar bills
and not taking change

  it was the awed muttering of jen-
nings who appeared to have fallen into
a haze in fact that afternoon larkin
said that when he was on first waiting
to steal jennings coached him along
thus take a lead buy a rose with
a ten-spot whoa boy dont take
th change yea boy rose i tell
you

  quinlan had gone mad

mad	- 

  what a peurile febrile word it is to
express the doings of the celebrated
southpaw after that day balldom
yet talks of the doings of the most no-
the strange doings of mister quinlan	

torious short skate that ever hit big-
league circles

  that afternoon quinlan won his way
into the immortals for not a smell of
first base did a single bear get and
following the direction of his constant
gaze while on the bench the high roll-
ers wondered at the adoration glowing
in the beautiful eyes of the most daz-
zling girl that had ever graced a box
at that particular park

  it was after that game that quinlan
sprung his first sensation calling jos-
lin aside he whispered something in
his ear at which the manager looked
startled then walked over to the box
in which the girl of josh reynards
comment still waited and indulged in
a long conversation which caused two
bewitching dimples to stand out in her
rosy cheeks the men were only held
in the clubhouse by their desire to have
further explanation from quinlan re-
garding his dealings with limpy and
also by curiosity to find out what jos-
lin meant when he told them the south-
paw had something to say to them

  when quinlan arrived his face was
beaming with boyish delight and good
feeling the players regarded him
curiously wonderingly did ever man
take such delight in overthrowing a
cripple

  just wait a second fellows till i
get on my clothes he called ive
got a big notion to celebrate to-night
and youre all in

  using up limpys stale peanuts
sneeringly queried jennings

  we might have them too crypti-
cally answered the pitcher i have a
few automobiles waiting at the gate to
haul us to the hotel and maybe limpy
can get the peanuts down in time for
dinner

  automobiles dinner and from
quinlan 

  curiosity overcame their distaste for
indulging in any of the fruits of his
rotten victory over the little privilege

man but it was a silent glum party
that was driven to the crown hotel
where only mr collins millionaire
owner of the high rollers stopped
the marvel increased when instead of
paying off the chauffeurs quinlan or-
dered them to wait and take every one
home he did it in a manner that told
plainly as words that he was accus-
tomed to giving just such orders to just
such men

  about the lobby the men waited a
few moments while quinlan held a
whispered conversation with the man-
ager of the hotel then that gentleman
himself came over to them and con-
ducted them to the elevator cages
quinlan was a host beyond reproach
his manner perfectly easy and gracious

  there was another wait outside a
pair of huge folding doors a wait re-
lieved by the passing about of boxes
of cigars the brand of which only was
familiar to these men who live upon
the best and who are able if they
choose to accept of the best admir-
ingly tendered them by fan admirers

  and then the doors were thrown
open to display a table glittering with
the most fragile glass and golden plate
never was such a  banquet as the
tongue-tied players sat down to never
was a more wondering body of men
served but not even this could down
their animosity against the player who
had always been so niggardly and who
to gain this precious wealth had gone
to such cruel lengths nor could the
easy affability the charming gracious-
ness of their host dispel the gloom
quinlan was in very dutch and no
filling of stomachs could set him right

  as they leaned moodily back in their
seats before the coffee waiting for the
speeches they knew to be inseparable
from such an affair quinlan raised his
hand whispered something to the ob-
sequious head waiter then lifted his
voice

  boys he said pressing his


new story magazine

knuckles down hard upon the polished
board im no talker and what ive
got to say will come out in a few words
im not going to listen to any thanks
now because ive got an engagement
with a young lady that id mightily
hate to break but theres a new brand
of cigarettes im interested in which
the waiter will pass around in a sec-
ond good-by

  the players gasped as he stepped
swiftly out the room then a hearty
laugh rose followed by a babel of
sound

  can you beat it

  some cigarette firm has hired quin-
nie to advertise their brand

  and were the goats

 picture of the high rollers who
know and use only the best smoking
egyptian harems

  before each man was placed a tiny
box another laugh rose

  first sale of a hundred thousand
will clear the cost of this feed
quinnie cant be beat

  pipe the size of the box bout as
big as griffins curve

  thus the eommcnt changed in an
instant to a loud whistle df amazement
from little josh reynard as he stared
mouth open eyes bulging into the
opened box

  from a bed of blue cotton blazed
at him a glittering mass of brilliants
crusted on a shield which bore a pen-
dulant baseball and on that baseball

were the wprds high rollers--

  each box contained the same souve-
nir the talk died down lifted itself
once more then the men rose slowly
stupidly

  it must have cost the whole ten
thousand muttered jennings then
skeptically unless the diamonds are
paste

  paste howled josh reynard
authority on stones why theyre
the finest blue-white beauties i ever
lamped

  but whats the answer

  answer-there aint an answer
quinnies gone nuts

  there was little sleep that night the
men gathering jogether in clusters still
discussing the marvel joslin came
round his face glowing and behind
him a little ways wandered a beaming
ruddy-faced pop mcclung and a chip-
per limpy

 why pop where did you blow
from

  say limpy whats massaged dull
care out of your nut

  but the men only shook their heads
smilingly 

  tell you boys said joslin when
he was threatened with mob violence if
he did not explain to some extent mr
collins just sold the club to-day and
the new owner has given pop the job
of ground deeper he has also handed
limpy all the privileges of the park-
bar and cushions and programs in ad-
dition to the soft stuff and peanuts
new owner

  yep hell be in the owners box
this afternoon hes a thirty-third de-
gree fan and-well wait till you take
a slant at him

  of course it was quinlan there
is no use delaying that which you al-
ready know it was quinlan seated
beside the beauty of the game of the
day before he strolled over to the
bench immediately finding himself sur-
rounded by his teammates

  im flat broke boys he said dole-
fully it isnt any use i started out
a spendthrift and a spendthrift ill al-
ways be the beloved governor of
mine happens to be a millionaire min-
ing man out in nevada i raised such
hell with his coin that he chucked me
out to earn ten thousand and now
ive gone and spent it again but he
saw it first though he saw it first

and everything will be all right-

  but joslin said-

  im broke boys except for the high
the strange doings of mister quinlan



rollers and my wife in the box with
me i want you to come round after
the game and meet her it takes a lot
of nerve and love for a guy like me
to stick out of a two-bit limit poker
game and harpoon a cripple just to
win a girl-but gee boys just lamp
her for a second and tell me aint it
worth the miserliness

  mr jennings in company with the
rest of the high rollers did lamp
the beaming blushing bride in the
owners box then he spoke

  keep loosened up with the change
mr new boss its a good habit with
a owner in this bunch keep loosened
up in every way quinnie but hang on
to that dame tight as you ever squeezed
a cent in the last six months thats

the tip of the high rollers aint it
boys tell quinnie what you think
the vociferous response had not sub-
sided before a sudden ungovernable
squirt of tears shot to quinlans eyes
as he grasped jennings hand

  my name boys he said is har-
vey and i thought of using it for my
regular box name but ive changed my
mind ive just heard something from
some one outside of pop for the first
time since i joined you that sounds
mighty good to me say it over again
jennings-its regular music

  whats that demanded the aston-
ished in fielder

  quinnie softly responded the mi-
serly southpaw quinnie gee thats
some name

by john quartu

an upperclassman a confident
smartly garbed youth of the type curly
had learned to associate unerringly with
the fraternities

  be there on time warned this sud-
den friend and passed with a sig-
nificant wink

  curlys heart swelled in a gush of
warm gratitude as he mumbled ac-
knowledgment would he be there on
time could anything keep him from
being there on time he watched the
trim figure swinging on down the
campus path noting the carefree swag-
ger the snappy flare of the coat the
high-cuffed trousers he watched with
admiration and a touch of awe

chapter i

comebody hit him a blow on the
shoulder and dragged him aside
with affectionate roughness somebody
whispered in his ear with mysterious
emphasis

  get that note all right old chap

  curly nodded eagerly into the smil-
ing superior face that bore over the
heavy hand

  oh yes-yes thanks i got it sure
enough

  he recognized the questioner-as an
outcast mongrel pup might recognize a
pampered prize winner whom he has
seen and envied from gutter distance
	new story

  it had come at last the offer of fel-
lowship and friendship for which he
had hungered it had happened at last
the mysterious visitation which called
him out of loneliness and neglect he
held the proof of it in the letter he had
received that morning there went the
actual messenger of it down the walk

  he flushed with painful self-con-
sciousness as he suddenly realized the
contrast he must have presented beside
that gilded butterfly of college fashion
just now

  he was shabby his pants were
guiltless of crease and flirted distantly
with the tops of his hobnailed shoes
his sleeves revealed an unornamefital
expanse of red bony wrist above each
big hand a ready-made tie of purple
satin advertised his bulgy chest and his
rural taste uncut fringes of hair about
his ears added nothing to the style of
an ancient slouch hat

  this was the understanding that
came to curly dowd apparently at
the touch of a condescending hand in
fact his mind had been subtly prepar-
ing for the discovery during the two
weeks since he had tramped into the
varsity town with a huge carpetbag
bumping against his leg and a great am-
bition pumping at his heart

  he had learned a great deal in those
two weeks things having nothing
whatever to do with lectures and text-
books

  he had learned that the college com-
munity was divided into two great
camps the greeks and the bar-
barians  which meant in rough trans-
lation the kid-glove guys and the slobs

  he had learned that the student mem-
bers of the greek-letter societies or
frats formed the social political and
athletic trust the privileged circle

  he had learned that to join a frat
was to have friends influence impor-
tance standing attention and a thou-
sand advantages while to be a barb
was to remain lonely forgotten unre-

magazine

marked shunned lost in the common
herd amid a thousand handicaps

  because he was young and normal
curly dowd had cra-ved companionship
laughter pals hard handgrips and the
good things of human society and be-
cause he wanted to belong he had seen
no reason why he shouldnt

  but now he could sec-partly look-
ing down at his misfit clothes he could
see this was another illuminating mo-
ment in his essential education

  gosh what an awful roughneck ive
been murmured curly dowd

  and he stopped long enough to pol-
ish his shoes on his calves glancing
guiltily about the while 

  that aint so bad he noted ap-
proving the process and the result ill
buy me one of them new celluloid col-
lars to-morrow

  to-morrow

  he thrilled at the word marvelous
things were to happen to him before
that day rolled around glorious sur-
prises were due before another dawn
he laughed aloud to himself in sheer
content and slapped his solid thigh
what mattered such trifles as collars
now he had won his hearts desire
in spite of all deficiencies 

  yes won it to demand what you
want outright-and get it thats win-
ning and that was what he had done

  fortunately

  he had not left to the frats them-
selves the task of seeking him out he
had not waited for them to pry under
his rusty exterior for the good stuff in-
side he had declared himself frankly
applied for membership

  and the reward was just ahead he
had had the promise of it a written
and official acceptance a familiar
touch on his shoulder a confidential
voice in his ear

  by to-morrow he would be admitted
to the fraternity group by to-morrow
he would have comrades chums part-
ners by to-morrow he would have
the neophyte



left the ranks of the undistinguished
many to flock with the favored few

  gosh chuckled curly dowd ill
bet them fellers are reglar cut-ups
bet theyll initiate me good 

  he brought from an inner pocket
the note that bad been smuggled under
his door in the cheap student boarding
house that morning and studied it
again furtively

  an amazing communication writ-
ten in red ink and spread around with
skulls daggers coffins in sinister array
just die sort of delightful foolishness
that always accompanied a real sure-
enough bid and it ran in this
fashion 

neophyte

know by these presents that you have been
  called and chosen to join a dread and secret
  band at midnight on the striking of the
  clock you will deliver yourself up at the coal
  wharf there to meet your doom as you love
  life say nothing of this to any one be
  prompt beware 

  curly dowd was chuckling again
over this wonderful missive when a
shadow fell across the paper he
whipped it away and looked up just in
time to avoid colliding with a spare
alert elderly figure that was just turn-
ing into the graveled campus walk
pardon professor he murmured
professor mccracken stopped and
smiled with a kindly word that was
always professor mccrackens way
with every one more particularly was
it his way with gawky raw freshmen
who were having a hard time of it in
the first weeks of college life

  the professor understood he had
seen too many promising youngsters
crushed by the weight of social ostra-
cism under the frat system he had
seen too many ambitious boys make a
losing battle against loneliness and the
sense of failure because they were
never bid he had seen too many
ordinary fellows on the other hand
turned into finished snobs by the frat

     

atmosphere aside from fighting frats
and what he called their undemocratic
and vicious arrogation of power he ex-
tended sympathy and help as he was
able to those who suffered by them

  dowd he said impulsively ive
been looking for you i want you to
join our little geological club all
good workers like yourself youll
make good friends there

  curly flushed and thanked him hat
in hand

  were off for an expedition to
mulberry island to-night in the college
launch camping out you know and
returning to-morrow-seven of us im

sure-

  he checked the look of embarrass-
ment that spread upon the freshmans
broad face

  whats the matter

  im sorry stammered dowd to-
night-i- cant i have an engage-
ment

  an engagement queried the pro-
fessor surprised

  curly nodded and started to unfold
the red-inked letter but he remem-
bered its warning in time and stood
mumchance professor mccracken
noted and made a shrewd guess-al-
beit an astonished one

  a-fraternity engagement dowd
yes sir nodded curly who could
not withhold a delighted grin

  it was strictly none of the profes-
sors business of course but impulse
moved him again

  youre sure of these frat friends
dowd sure thats the crowd you
want to run with

  oh yes sir stammered curly

  i know youve been lonely-but
most men who stand on their two feet
are that continued the professor
its a lot better to be lonely than to
make a mistake

  but i like them said curly rather
warmly they have such corking
good times theyre the real stuff


new story magazine

  he nodded emphatically

  oh said the professor rebuffed
i see well of course thats your
affair

  he passed on stiffly shaking his
head while the happy freshman hur-
ried away to a quiet corner where he
could read the fascinating note again

  how in the world did they ever
come to bid a boy like that-as sound
and genuine and simple and altogether
unfitted as that professor mccracken
wondered to himself

  how lucky it was i didnt wait for
them to bid me of their own accord-
gosh curly dowd exulted in his
vast satisfaction

chapter ii

  the deacon stood in the doorway
smiling the smile of an expectant ter-
rier

  a shout rocketed at him from the
length of the table here was sauce
for luncheon here was nippy news
they sensed it in his dancing eye and
his gladsome grin

  did he fall was the burden of
the outcry

  deak beamed upon them and main-
tained a suspensive silence he slid
into his chair and motioned for food
eager hands hastened to do his will
gramp who as the only postgrad in
the chapter presided over the huge
serving platter did him honor in the
matter of cutlets palpitant fresh-
men descended upon the kitchen and
dispossessed the slow-moving waiter of
coffee and pie for his benefit

  speak up deak whined pringle
most fretful of sophomores we get
the dramatic effect thats enough

  im faint returned the deacon re-
proachfully cant  stay my fam-
ine

  no they chorused out with it
deak

  the deacon lifted a chunk of cutlet

on the end of his fork and regarded it
tenderly he had his mouth opened
for the succulent morsel when tootle
grabbed his wrist tootle was guard
on the varsity and had a generous fist

  not a crumb till you tell he
growled

  deak gazed piteously at the end of
his fork

  well-i saw him

  did he fall

  like a ton of brick

  they snickered with glee clamoring
for details but the deak had a mouth-
ful and only grinned greasily

  i knew that softhead clam would
fall for it cut in sooky with vast
freshman confidence

  you knew echoed pringle

  yes i did insisted sooky hotly
why in polycon yesterday he hauled
out a huge red bandanna to rub his big
ham of a face with soon as deak let
on he was going to send him a phony
bid i called the turn i said nothing
was too raw for that rube and-it
aint

  sookys right nodded tootle
there never was such a dub have
you seen his neckties

  granted the chap is a section hand
said pringle but it hardly seems pos-
sible he could be so dull why do
animals like that ever come to college
anyhow 

  to furnish us with amusement
suggested gramp

  well if its true lies delivered him-
self up horse foot and guns like this
im in favor of doing justice to him
stated pringle sharply lets make
him a howling communal joke some
way or other

the deacon made a lofty gesture
what do you suppose i sent him
the bid for im a philanthropist and
a public benefactor i am everybodys
in on this act

  already 

  yep saw bulty and hunk woods
the neophyte



up at the hall the tri eps are
primed so are the phi us hunk
is going around to the deltas and tell
them the gaudy plot but say-you fel-
lows think you know something about
the rareness of that bird wait till
 tell you

  they waited while he luxuriously
consumed a huge bite of pie he had
their full attention

 why-he only applied for admis-
sion to the phi us thats all 

  ivhatf shrieked the bunch in one
blast

 thats it affirmed deak he
stopped hunk-yesterday it was-
pointed to his phi u pin and gave out
it was the yearning of his youthful
bosom to belong to one of them there
frat clubs any frat-but hunks
would do and please would hunk
kindly see to it

 oh my orphan aunt sobbed
sooky and laid his head upon the table

  the unbelievable raciness of it left
most of them incoherent they rocked
they wept they pounded one another
on the back only gramp retained a
vestige of his rep as a patriarch

  thats one of the kind you read
about he remarked is it true by
any chance

  hunk swore by all his gods de-
clared deak and if youd seen the
cowlike delight on the idiots face when
i lisped in his ear on the campus just
now youd know he is capable of any-
thing

  but-applied gasped tootle
why not  tell you that crea-
ture has the moss bearded on him like
a forest primeval the meadow larks
are roosting in his hayloft he reeks
absolutely reeks

  pringle had hooted with the rest but
laughter was not adequate for what he
felt

  by jing a thing like that needs
treatment he piped in his shrill bit-
ing voice its a giddy jest of course

meanwhile hes an offense an insult
to a decent school its lowering our
tone to tolerate cattle of that kind
im sorry for the rustic if he rouses
pringles tone put in gramp slyly

  never mind being funny retorted
pringle sharply this has gone be-
yond a joke if what deak tells us is
true weve got to take action you
cant snub such a plebeian you cant
show him his place by ordinary means
think of it a monumental ass that
asks to join a frat

  deak checked him with another wave
be calm you seem to forget whos
got this in charge im going to attend
to him

  attend to him by driving him out
snapped pringle thats the only ade-
quate move we cant tolerate him
dont believe youll have to tolerate
him long after i get done leave it to
me

  i want to be sure you hit on some-
thing he can understand thats all
insisted pringle a matter like this
is serious the worst thing that ever
happened to this college was old mc-
crackens getting those three chaps ex-
pelled last term for hazing with that
kibosh laid we might do something
ease your mind of old cracko said
the deacon with a mysterious smile
hes the least of my worries

  there isnt a place in town where
you could pull off anything without his
hearing of it suggested tootle

  the deacon went upon his dignity
once for all you guys back up
whose scheme is this mine i be-
lievel i sent him the phony bid i
nursed him on it i gave out the in-
vites to a doings its all mine and i
aint going to loosen another word ill
only say to you children be at the coal
wharf to-night or miss the time of your
young lives-thats all

  give us a hint deak they begged
deak set down his coffee cup and
grinned

  the good ship zacariah johnson
sails for parts unknown this midnight
leave the rest to your uncle

chapter iii

  a restless householder in one of the
little cottages that clump above the
storied banks of the sequanock had a
curious experience that night he
turned in his bed and lifted the shade
and peered out through faint moonlight
blurred and veiled with low-flying
wrack and it seemed to him that he
saw a small low-hulled vessel with a
single smokestack surge slowly out of
the ragged shadows behind the coal
companys wharf and glide down the
stream

  he gazed and rubbed his eyes and
presently huddled with shivery haste
into his sheets again for a cloud had
passed and lo the river was empty
and the dim shape gone and no glint
of  lantern or furnace or side light
whereupon he remembered the sally
meadozv the tragic old rear-wheeler
that went into the chute below mul-
berry island with sixty souls aboard
back in the war time and still came
hooting and listing down the bowl so
the clam fishers swore in the late sum-
mer storms-a kind of fresh-water
flying dutchman

  it was not a matter to pry into the
mirage of the sally meadow it was
held to be bad luck of the worst kind
and the dredgers who had seen it never
boasted thereof so the householder
who was river-born jammed his head
into his pillow and tried to make him-
self believe that the prickle of a rising
wind had played tricks with his nerves

  a closer or less credulous observer
might have looked twice and guessed
better might have recognized in that
dim water wraith the unlovely but
wholly material form of a very different
vessel the zacariah johnson to wit
superannuated ferry cattle transport

and clam dredge if he had been close
enough he might even have received
olfactory proof of the apparitions iden-
tity and her employment

  still had the interest of this suppos-
ititious witness led him so far as to row
out and board the ancient craft he
might after all have reverted upon the
householders naive suspicions

  for it was a ghostly crew that sailed
the sequanock that night

  on the forward deck were clustered
some forty weird and fearsome figures
they were black-robed from head to
foot and under their cowls they mur-
mured and gibbered from grinning
skulls they were clustered about the
little capstan as about a sacrificial al-
tar and upon that altar was stretched
a human victim a victim bound with
ropes disheveled stripped to the waist
hard-breathed and helpless

  weird rites were being practiced as
the spectral mob swayed and hustled in
a ring

  who receives this candidate
chanted a melancholy voice

  a blood brother moaned the dis-
mal throng

  who marks his brow

  a blood brother they chorused
balefully

  who strips his hide

  brother-blood brother

  who plucks his heart

  blood-blood brother

  and they groaned like the mournful
tombs

  the leader a lean portentous figure
reared himself upon the rail and de-
livered his sentence with awful solem-
nity

  neophyte the judgment of the
brethren has been passed know that
all who aspire to enter this most noble
and famous order must undergo the ut-
termost trial in body and spirit lest
they be unworthy know that many
are tested but few survive know
that the dread moment approaches
the neophyte



pause while yet you may pause while
life itself remains are you still hardily
minded to tempt your fate

  they crowded close peering down to
catch the least intonation the least
quaver that might lend a gratifying
tang to the reply

  the pale face gazed up at them but
not in dread not in doubt rather
in simple gratitude and this was the
astonishing reply

  oh yes sir ive heard about these
nitiations i dont mind a bit any
fun you fellers are bound to have with
me is all right-if you only let mein 
there was a choking sound from the
ghostly ring and certain of the execu-
tioners found it necessary to withdraw
hurriedly beyond the deck house

  deak gasped one gigantic bogle
who hung limp upon the leader im-
mortal greek we salute you never
never was such a clover-scented kine
your paw deak

  now will you believe it was the
response from under a general gurgling
chorus i told you chaps didnt i
made a scientific study and told you
and you doubted and i might have
kept him as a juicy morsel for our own
bunch-but i didnt im a philan-
thropist do you appreciate you other
muttonheads 

  they did and paid him homage
still you cant blame us put in
another the guy is stupendous hes
incredible

  i believe y growled a fat ghost
aint it a bum actor you hired to kid
us all deak why he aint even wor-
ried

  worried hes blissful utterly
blissful cant we begin to laugh pretty
soon ill bust soon

  an active quick-gestured member
thrust in

  im sick of laughs he declared ac-
ridly the pig needs a lesson and a
damn stiff one whats the good of

laughing hes too thick to get the
point

  hell get it when he wakes up to-
morrow

  not good enough insisted the
sharp-tongued speaker

  our pringle abhors the subtle quip
theres nothing subtle about him
was the irritated reply hes an out-
rage if you fellows mean to keep up
fraternity prestige in this school youve
got to take a high hand with such in-
truders once for all

  pringles right murmured the fat
ghost and others nodded won to this
forceful view

  soothe your perturbec spirits in-
terrupted the deacon seems i can
never get you to remember whose game
this is list to me when i whisper that
the night is to be historic

  they sensed significance in his con-
fident accents and hushed to expectancy

  i havent the soul of a thumbscrew
like pringle went on deak but my
ambitions are leaping say-you may
have noticed that when i began to
gather a crowd i got at least one chap
from every frat while  was about it
its a fact admitted somebody in
the pause even the betas theres
medicine ball over by the capstan now
so the whole greek outfit is in on
this enforced deak

  well

  whats the machiavellian answer
the answer is were all in this thing
together the answer is that should
we happen to kick over a few faculty
rules to-night we all stand together
they cant fire the entire greek con-
tingent so were safe no matter
what we do

 and that means-

  that means we are about to revive
the king of the lost arts announced
deak dramatically

  hazing

  you apprehend me stephen nod-

new story magazine

  they hesitated it was a gorgeous
temptation

  what about old cracko asked
some one

  cracko is far away he went off
this evening in the launch with the
crackums his pet little gang of stone
breakers we are well past the town
gramp has been poling us around the
bend where we can anchor at ease
the rest is-silence are you on

  lead us to it gurgled the fat
ghost

  and they all voted with him no
resisting deaks logic no rejecting the
opportunity he had created he swept
them with him to the waiting feast of
glee and they shouted secure in his
assurance

 then we hoof him squeaked
pringle

  the classic hoof of all time re-
turned the deak uplifted to the pe-
nultimate limit

chapter iv

  they began mildly they passed a
rope around the victim set him for-
ward at the bitts and then snatched him
after through a flailing gantlet of bar-
rel staves

  two huge and very fleshy shades who
might have been tootle and a fellow
guard in the life paired on the deck
house and did the hauling he came
like a ball on a string only to be
bounced back again and made to repeat

  the roar of the third trip was domi-
nated by a bull bellow from the rail

  over with the boob

  half a dozen huskies grabbed him
on either side took a long swing and
shot him forthright into the dark and
the river

  yo-heave bawled the bucko ghost
and they snaked the rope inboard again
with a half-drowned neophyte on the
end of it wiggling like a hooked eel

  the other side

  they howled rapturously and slung
him to port and while he was there they
dropped him back a few times so that
he could catch his breath under the
river but when he was back again
there was air enough air to stand on

  the rope had been run through a
block on the stubby derrick mast and
he hung a foot above the deck

 form up for dummy practice
came the order everybody tackles
they obeyed with gusto and ran
ramming into the helpless bundle one
after the other until it whirled like a
teetotum after that they lowered it
until the toes just touched the planks
and demonstrated with the staves while
it span helplessly making futile efforts
to stand and brace

  a feeble and breathless sooky stum-
bled out of the whooping melee to lean
against the bulwark near gramp who
was content to watch

 hold me up im joy-jagged
gasped the promising infant what
next gramp oh uncle mine will you
look at it though-just look at it

  the scene had just burst upon sooky
in all its ripeness and his emotion was
scarce unnatural

  the pipe dream of a salem witch
burner agreed gramp

  certainly no sane vision ever before
held such a sight as the forward deck
of the zacariah johnson the shaded
lariitern on the deck house gave a fox-
fire glow and therein the black shapes
hooted and gamboled monstrous in
their flapping robes outboard the
night was gullied by lawless winds that
came in sharp hot puffs cloudwrack
unveiled a ragged slip of a moon and
gave an instants finishing touch of in-
fernal fantasy there came a growl of
thunder from up the river

  where are we asked sooky peer-
ing into the innocent blackness it
wouldnt do for the native to pipe this
anywhere

  were safe from that i dropped
the neophyte



the anchor myself as we came behind
the bend we can pole back

  sooky grabbed his arm

  then whats that

  beyond his pointed finger in the
brief flick of moonlight they had a
glimpse of a vague massive bulk
againstthe sky it slid away like a
mirage into the windy blank

  bend nothing i learned the river
pretty well this summer snooky was
suddenly very sober that looks like
grayling bluff to me sure your an-
chor held

  not sure no

  shes still short then hurry
  they scrambled forward

  grayling bluff means a matter of
three miles below town dont it in-
quired gramp

  if that was all came the answer
against a gust of wind it means were
in the bowl something less than a
mile above the rapids and cedar chute
on this side the river gramp say
nothing but hurry

  no one missed the two deserters
the jovial crew was already deep in
further delights under the skilled guid-
ance of the deak the candidate had
been cut down revived with a generous
draft of tabasco and was now stripped
to fighting trim within a yelling ring

  cotton pillows were bound upon his
fists and he was booted into action
against a laughing young giant who sa-
luted him with a four-ounce glove
smacked to the jaw strong arms
caught him as he faded and thrust him
back into the fray

  fight you rummy

  he turned a glance around at his tor-
mentors while he lifted his helpless
hands and somehow he found a way
to smile a wry smile rather disfig-
ured but fatuous and willing as ever

  its all right boys he nodded ill
do my best

  somebody tripped him as he moved
into action and he went staggering

against a facer he waved the pillows
and tried to counter and the mob
shouted as his opponent rocked him
here and there at will the loudest of
all in the front rank was pringle who
had thrown aside all disguise shrilling
and hopping with eagerness

  smash him  smash the slob why
he aint even broke yet wipe that
smile off

   and as the victim reeled past pringle
got in some good work for himself with
a buffet across the mouth

   it was hugely entertaining but all too
brief knocked breathless dizzy and
half blind the neophyte went down
under a full swing that pulped his ear
and was unable to rise without help

  they gave him help

 the thirty-third degree howled
deak i call for human sacrifice up
with him to the masthead

   they trussed him like a basting fowl
this time and added the last artistic
touch of horror with a blindfold then
they hauled him to the end of the der-
rick arm where he dangled twenty feet
above the deck

   cut the rope

   the cry went up in ravening chorus
and they waited to hear him weaken
to plead as a right stout heart might
have done at such a moment without
shame

   cut the rope

  he stayed mute amid savage cries
then the rope was duly severed and its
burden shot down through space that
it brought up again fifteen feet lower
on the prepared loop with a tremendous
jerk could scarce have been much com-
fort to the unfortunate neophyte

  and still he had not caved when
they let him down dragged him to lan-
tern light and slopped a bucket over
him he blinked and nodded up at them
cheerfully no sign of fear no shrink-
ing to many it was curious and disap-
pointing to pringle it was sheer
scandal and outrage


new story magazine

  aint you got anything better he
squealed

  but the deak was already launched
upon his master maneuver from the
engine-room doorway he swarmed to
view with a flaming charcoal brazier in
his hand while the hopeful outfit
bound their victim to the mast and the
rising wind trailed sparks across the
deck from a nest of glowing irons he
announced his triumph

  neophyte he boomed sepulchrally
the fatal moment has come thus far
we have merely trifled with you now
comes the true ordeal

  an expectant silence fell disturbed
only by the coming murmur of storm
and a grumble of thunder the black
robes gathered round again in solemn
state

  know that you enter o wretched
neophyte under a new rule of our noble
order henceforth each candidate who
rashly persists in his ambition if he
survives all else must submit to have
the magic insignia of the order-brand-
ed upon his forehead

  deak snatched a glowing iron from
the brazier and flourished it there was
no make-believe about that iron

  are you ready

  the candidates face was pale but he
answered steadily

  any boss you want to play boys
aint i pretty near in

  youll be in all right the deak
said grimly forever afterward to be
recognized as a full and certified mem-
ber of the alpha-sigma-sigma
the crowd heard stared a moment
gurgled and broke into prancing as
the bandage was thrust into place again

 alpha-sigma-sigma wovv-ee
hes qualified slap the brand on him
deak whiffed the iron near and as
the victim instinctively shrank from the
heat he clapped to the forehead a little
cube of ice pressing it with devilish
precision three times he repeated and

the blinded neophyte writhed for the
illusion was painfully real then while
the mob wept for laughter with the ges-
ture of a conjurer and the craft of an
inquisitor he whipped out a bottle and
brush and deftly painted his three let-
ters in staring black across the helpless
brow

  rah-rah-rah-alpha sig sig
they rioted rah rah rah for the
alpha sig sig

  deak desisted from labor amid em-
bracing arms and as they closed on
him he revealed the ultimate touch of
genius

  acid in that paint he murmured
he wont get it off for a week

  they were still striving feebly to
do justice to the olympian glory of the
great man when gramp with sooky at
his heels came leaping down the deck
and burst upon them like a bombshell

  help you fellows the anchor
chains twisted or something and well
all be down cedar chute in half a min-
ute 

chapter v

  the night split wide with a searing
blue flare and showed the startled crew
a strange river not the wide familiar
shores by the bend but the battle-
mented cliffs below grayling bluff and
the narrow channel that swept down in-
side mulberry island not the easy
languid stream that passed the town
but a hurrying swirling flood that
twisted in eagerly for the chute and its
deadly rapids

  at the wink of the next glare the
first squall struck driving great drops
like scatter shot blue was streaked
with gleaming yellow where froth
leaped up beneath the lash with living
green where the shuddering tree masses
lifted

  and the storm was on them sweep-
ing down the valley as sequanock
storms can sweep heeling the old
zacariah johnson like a dead leaf driv-
the neophyte



ing what counsel might have prevailed
aboard her to amazed confusion

 but-but-bowd this happen
howd we get here came the high
wail of pringle

  drifted you idiot bawled gramp
against the roar of the gale isnt any-
body going to help

  they broke up as the rain struck
sheetwise dodging helter-skelter or-
ders appeals and questions went un-
heeded some swarmed to the house
and attacked the single dinghy long
bedded there in paint others shouted
and waved toward the shore if any help
might come from that wild stretch
sooky had found a ring preserver and
ran with it along the rail peering down
with it into the yellow foam pringle
quite simply paralyzed cowered on the
deck one inspired soul flocked by him-
self to the little cabin and span the
wheel with frantic energy a few
crawled forward after gramp to fum-
ble at the stubborn chain and wrestle
impotently with the capstan

  meanwhile the storm was piling up
and the zacariah johnson was lumber-
ing down the island channel like a bar-
rel on a hill slope

  look there some one cried hoarse-
ly and pointed below across the tawny
waters and there through the lightning
flicker and the flying spume they had
a glimpse of another craft a low white
strip swaying among the broken waters
they quavered into a hail but it died
shredded on the blast and drowned in
thunder

  theyre done too gasped medi-
cine ball

  its the clinkers launch

  the instants hope passed for they
saw that the other craft was as helpless
as their own sliding the channel below
them and nearer the island side though
more slowly

  the little group about the capstan
stared into the weltering canon of the
rapids and the wet wind came sud-

denly chill as they realized they hung
literally upon the edge of death

  were going down-going down
babbled bunty good god 

  it was the last urge of panic and they
scattered again crying and stumbling
in their absurd black robes there was
no plan or reason in them and when
tootle in a final frantic tug happened
to loosen the capstan lock and release
the suspended chain no soul on board
had anything to thank save sheer acci-
dent

  the anchor plunged and found a grip
somewhere below the zacariah john-
son came careering around like a cow
on a tether the flood whipped her
over tilted the froth into her decks
and finally straightened her out on a
drumming chain in the full mouth of the
chute

  the crew lay where they had fallen
or huddled drinking the deep breath
of immediate safety and staring out
toward the island staring in dread
of what they might see at the next flash
the launch with the geological party
was out there somewhere and the
thought of her leaped into every mind
with the relief of present personal fear
presently they had a photographic
glimpse of her in near the rocks head
to the current with her passengers a
black dot at the stern

  engine short-circuited shes an-
chored  gasped the deak who found
himself lying against gramp by the
mast

  but it wont hold didnt you see
shes sliding

  so it was as all of them knew when
the lightning flickered up once more
the first squall had half filled the little
craft she had been sucked into the
chute her anchor was too small or
too light to hold her and now she
was dragging slowly down the current
boiling about her at mill-race speed

  at instants she caught and seemed to
brace bravely again the hungry thin


new story magazine

water ridges edged with foam as cruel
as fangs bore her back in a whelming
charge no foot lost could be regained
it was a slow-drawn agony of waiting
a racking hopeless struggle against the
inevitable those aboard her were pow-
erless to aid themselves-with the tum-
ble of the rapids ever nearer

  the crew of the zacariah johnson
watched in terrified fascination and
their nerves went to straw in them as
they saw the launch slip and slip and
slip again like a weary man who clings
to a beetling roof some whimpered
some crouched on the deck and hid
their faces this clap of tragedy com-
ing upon the very lilt of their folly
struck them groveling

  theres not a chance for her
croaked the deak not a chance
seven lives answered gramp in
a groan

  what you doing about it asked a
clear voice

  they looked up the neophyte still
stood against the mast forgotten by
every one he had quietly worked
himself free of the wrist ropes re-
moved his bandage and was now strip-
ping himself of the last of his bonds
what you fellows mean to do
do repeated deak dully we
cant throw a rope that distance theres
nothing to do

  curly dowd stepped free and took a
quick survey of the deck the huddled
groups the white faces under the light-
ning flashes

 nothing weve a sound boat-
plenty of hands going to let those
folks drown without an effort 

  the crisp eager phrases dragged a
few uncertainly to their feet but they
had little time to wonder at this strange
new note in the despised rube or to
resent it

  any steam he snapped

  the fires are banked we only
poled

  stoke em then we can be mov-
ing in five minutes

  he jumped aft to the little door of
the engine room it was lighted and
half filled with frightened initiators in
their sopping robes who had crowded
in for warmth and shelter

  look alive shouted curly dowd
grab them shovels and jam some coal
into her you other guys get busy on
the capstan and walk her up

  nobody moved they stared at him
bulking there against the livid sky with
blank eyes he turned to the deak and
the others who had followed him

  theres nobody can run the engine
stammered bunty

  ill run her rapped the neophyte

  whats the idea

  dowd had been sensing the attitude
of these valiant manhandlers as his
eyes swept them his face suddenly
darkened and knotted

  damn it all this aint no debatin
society he cried seven people dy-
ing thats the idea theres steam
pressure on the gauge now  if we drop
down we might save them yet maybe
we got to try

  leave our anchorage now came
a burst from tootle i should say
not

  curlys glance flashed and widened on
him

  he looked around the group again

 whos with me will anybody
help

  wed all help if there was a chance
said gramp smoothly it cant be
done

  it might be done 

  youre crazy shrilled pringle
thrusting in were safe out of those
rotten rapids were safe only just
safe and were going to stav safe you
fool

  curly dowd passed the quivering
creature over

  is there a backbone in this crowd
he asked quietly nobody answered
the neophyte



outside the storm howled by back
of them somewhere the launch was la-
boring nearer the rocks

  because im going to try it alone
if i have to he added

  youll not lay a hand on that cap-
stan if thats what you mean growled
tootle

  you say so inquired curly dowd
and at the word he knocked tootle un-
derfoot with a smash between the eyes
caught up the slicing bar and began
to lay about him

  get t work y cowards its me
runs this craft now and by gosh ill
put some guts in y before im done

chapter vi

  the sequanocks used to say that the
big bad spirit comes to dwell between
the river cliffs in the tempestuous late
summer any clam dredger there-
abouts knows that the devil walks
abroad upon the waters of the bowl
when the thunderclouds mass low the
riverfolks have always agreed that
strange things occur within the sinister
sucking sweep of the rapids

  but no legend ever whispered a more
curious tale than the very haps as they
happed on board the good ship zcicaricih
johnson what time she dipped among
the rocks of a certain darksome night

  there was none to mark no outer
eye to see or ear to hear the storm
charged down the heights of grayling
bluff it whelmed all with clamor of
wind and artillery it blanketed all
with driving spume and rain the little
side-wheel steamer was a dim blot in
the welter what passed on her decks
and in her engine room only the forty-
odd souls who were there could have
told and of the forty-odd certainly
no single soul would have told chance
what might

  for once the myths of the sequanock
came to simple truth and within the

bowl there ranged a rampant being who
wielded the evil rod of power

  he flailed them around the house and
back again

  here and there one stood to him with
protert or outcry not understanding
such he stretched to the deck outright
and strode on driving the herd to his
will with words and blows that hurt

 you-and you-and you-smart
with them shovels theres lives to
save-lives to save y chicken-hearted
whelps work

  there were forty of them in the mass
and because  forty of them can all be
of dough there were some quickly
shamed into ready service sheer moral
force overmastered them as it always
must

  young they were and foolish and
flabby but not all literal cowards only
weakened by silly games and shallow
poses by snobbery and social cruelty
only half spoiled for manhood by the
vicious frat atmosphere by selfishness
pretense and monstrous conceit this
rough-handed roughnecked freshman
suddenly put upon them the compulsion
of red blood and clean brain and they
obeyed

  presently somehow the shovels were
flying

  the deak was among those who at-
tempted an argument the deak had
been badly shaken he clutched at
dowd

  we wont stand this he gabbed
who the dickens are you to smash
us around look here-

  curly dowd caught him by the arm
and wrenched him up under the dim
light where he could see into his eyes

  need you at the throttle there
thats it-shiny handle grab it and
wait for orders

  the deak gasped blinked and
sharply released stumbled for the en-
gine guard rail his hand groped out
and found the throttle

  work-work y pups


new story magazine

  they worked a feverish knot fed
the red maw of the furnace and the
foremost straddling a shovel with black
robe kilted around his waist bore a jag-
ged cut from the slicing bar over his
eye

  they worked

  a pale-faced youngster toiling with
the best was taken with a gust of sob-
bing

  if we can only do it-if were only
not too late

  curly stood to peer through the driv-
ing smother

  s all right sporthe cheered
theyre holding on if were all as
good as you well do it yet

  the pale face set sternly

  curly turned hard and a spanner
flew from the dark ahead of him and
caught him in the chest he gathered
the hysterical bundle that fluttered be-
fore him and dabbed the deck with it

  lemme go you big ruffian chat-
tered pringle lemme go i say you

want to murder the lot of us-

  the neophyte paused

oh its only you is it he queried
politely gosh i near mistook sorry
he slung the cringing pringle gently
to the top of the house and left him
paralyzed

  capstan here called the new com-
mander springing up the deck and it
was here he met tootle waiting with
medicine ball and another they
swarmed on him without preamble and
got the slicing bar

  the big guard was rather wild in his
heavy way

  if yre insane we aint he gasped
hugging the captive

  curlys answer came in crisp appeal
as he struggled 

 you damn fool cant you see this
aint personal the launch-think of
the launch

  that anchor stays

  the group swayed and staggered

  i warn you panted curly any-

thing goes now its lives youre on
the track and by god-you got to get
off-

  the three had been hauling and maul-
ing the neophyte all evening they had
the gauge of his resistance but it was
suddenly different curly did not mean
to fight this was no fight only a
primal issue being stupidly clogged
he moved with the simplicity permitted
to utmost need and straight purpose
things of which these young gentlemen
had never learned

  he sent a jab into tootle where it
closed him like a jackknife and laid
him cold he gave medicine ball the
knee and finished him by tripping him
headlong the third he merely took by
the throat and squeezed

  rough stuff on the high seas mur-
mured curly grimly as he got to his
feet

  a cry went up from the deck house

  the storm was still flickering through
its uproar and by a brighter flash the
launch far back now was seen to have
lost sharply the yellow spouting rocks
were close aboard her

  throw her open called the com-
mander to his engine-room chief for
all shes worth

  the craft quivered and jounced as
her rocking beam rose like the arm of a
rheumatic but still vigorous old lady
the note of machinery clanked above
the howling gale the paddle flapped
overside and the zacariah johnson
stretched jerkily into action

  tt seemed hopeless with the anchor
still to retrieve at every glimmer they
looked to see a blank where the launch
had been but curly dowd had a play
to make its win or lose boys he
laughed groping for the spanner as
he darted back to the capstan the
zacariah johnson eased  up and he
knocked out the shackle that held the
chain

  it snaked loose and away carrying
the neophyte



half the rail and the next instant the
flood had snatched them down the chute

chapter vii

  on the edge of the tumbling falls
under the jagged shore of mulberry
seven geologists in a half-sunken launch
watched a helpless old side-wheeler
careen past like a dying duck down a
brook

  for themselves they had given up
exhausted by bailing and shouting they
had finally wedged into the stern to give
their craft the last inch of forward lift
and abandoned a useless struggle there
they sat mute amid the sheeting sprays
and waited it could not be long now
once they were driven upon a rock the
end would come swiftly and mercifully

  broke her moorings alston the
little riverman who had come as engi-
neer made laconic comment

  they followed the dim craft whose
fate they could only expect would be
their own within some moments they
saw her swept away into the dark and
hopelessness had a murmur of pity to
spare for these other unfortunate com-
panions in disaster

  professor mccracken crouched un-
der the lee of the dead engine spoke
with quiet feeling

  poor fellows i made sure they
were safely anchored dredgers i sup-
pose with wives and children to think
of with that much more of bitterness
in their crisis yet they made no out-
cry we can remember that when our
time comes

  his grave voice calmed and nerved
the forlorn little band

  from the blinking rumbling turmoil
of the storm behind them sounded the
single blare of a steam whistle

  with common impulse those who
were still covered took off their caps
some of the weaker cowered lower
disaster was very close upon them

  the next instant alston was on his

feet clutching his neighbors stagger-
ing to the violent leaps of the launch
he pointed aft with an inarticulate
yell

  they stared

  something was bulking up out of the
storm veil where they had seen the
fated vessel disappear something that
seemed to gather and take form again
from the very spindrift they dared
not believe even when a brighter pencil
of lightning streaked across the base
and etched the lines of a river boat

  the sally meadow breathed als-
ton shrinking for what craft of wood
and steel had ventured that fearful
chute what navigators of flesh and
blood had ever steered that rock-strewn
channel 

  yet another minute and they knew
no mirage this no thing of their tor-
tured fancy a real side-wheeler buck-
ing stoutly up the stream with labored
exhaust and out-trailed banner of
sparks heading serenely through the
nested dangers the same side-wheeler
that they had seen whirled by to appar-
ent destruction

  she came down just for us cried
the professor with swift comprehen-
sion

  if youll tell me what pie-eyed luna-
tic on the river ud take such a chanst
burst from alston in sheer amazement

  and still of that too there was pres-
ently no doubt the steamer edged for
them fell off a trifle and edged again
foam piled up ori her bows like an
avalanche close under one wheel
boiled a jutting rock almost in her
path a yellow cascade flung above the
shoal it was mad it was impossible
but it was being done

  slowly she fought nearer her pad-
dles tearing the uptorn water into mist

  the climax came with a rush

  the launchs inadequate anchor
ripped again from its hold and she was
borne back she lifted whirled and
smashed like a shoe box snatched in-

stantly from the rock wrecked broken-
backed and sinking she was hurried
on-

  to toss in a smother of froth against
the quarter of the rescuing craft where
a dozen strong hands hauled the gasp-
ing geologists through the rail gap to
the low deck

chapter viii

  the professor stood before the wheel-
house blinking water and light blind-
ness from his eyes and seeking aston-
ished adjustment of the fact that the
crew of this clam dredge was a bunch
of hopefuls from his own college
campus

  he appealed to sooky

  if i could see the captain-to say to
him-to try-

  sooky waved to the cabin and slipped
away but the professor following the
gesture saw only a freshman student
spinning busily with the wheel in the
dim recess

  he tried again

  the dredger you know he asked
earnestly of gramp whoevers in

charge i dont seem to see- and

weve got something to ease our minds
of you may well believe

  his lips were a trifle unsteady

  youve all a great claim upon our
gratitude of course we feel it deeply

and we shall try- but where is the

captain  do tel me

  gramp took him by the arm

  youll find the boss right there at
the wheel he answered gravely and
professor he added low-voiced lies
the only one to thank wed rather
you knew as a matter of fact he
and he alone went down the chute after
you-and carried us with him

  gramp disappeared in his turn and
left the bewildered professor to grope
for the significance of his strange
words

the storm was passing giving way to

a spread of higher cloud and a gentler
breeze they were well out of the
bowl now running steadily undr
grayling bluff the wheel required
less attention when professor mc-
cracken entered the little cabin

  dowd he was saying incredulously
you are in command here

  the freshman turned with a grin

  i guess so for want of a better
how are you professor gosh hope
you come through chipper

  the professors reply died away in
open-mquthed amazement for now he
could see the figure that faced him

  curly naked to the waist was welted
and scored with crisscross blows one
eye was closed with a purple bruise
and a stave had laid open his cheek
but the thing that held the professors
startled eye the mark that flared upon
him was the triad of big black letters
painted across his brow

  the freshman was clearly uncon-
scious of the shameful and ludicrous
brand as he instantly saw and the
fact was illuminating besides being in
a way rather pathetic

 professor mccracken had not
watched and fought the fraternities for
years for nothing professor mc-
cracken was far from being slow of
apprehension professor mccracken
was nobodys fool

  a boatload of greeks on the river
at midnight black robes parapher-
nalia a single barb in sight added
the evidence before him dowds plea
of an engagement the confession of
gramp and the shamefaced silence and
aloofness of the whole outfit in what
should have been normally an hour of
congratulatory triumph

  he began to understand

  you were-initiated

  i guess so returned curly dowd
and it was the measure of the edu-
cational value of the last few hours that
believing he spoke the words with ab-
solute indifference
the neophyte



  he tended the wheel for a pause

  they put me into something i
reckon dont seem to remember the
name

 did they call it-alpha sigma

sigma 

  thats it

  do you know what it means

  not me

  behind the shaded light in the cabin
hung a tiny mirror lingering vanity of
some whiskered riverman the pro-
fessor took it down and offered it si-
lently

  curly dowd saw his own reflection
and the three reversed letters it bore
and as he read a hot red flush over-
spread his battered features

  a s s

  so they were razzling me-all the
time he noted quietly there aint
no such frat of course

  the professor waited for some fur-
ther comment but curly dowds
mouth only stayed set and grim

  there is one now said mccracken
a trifle incoherently and youre the
only member of it and id like to
say its the only emblem of the kind that
ever was a mark of honor or distinc-
tion youre alone because theres no-
body else in the crowd to class with
you by god sir-

  not academic language but the pro-
fessor was beginning to sense the things
that must have passed aboard the zac-
ariah johnson that night the low ad-
vantage taken the bitter humiliation
inflicted  the cowardly hurts finally
the single-handed struggle and conquest
when the real test of human character
broke for that crowd

  he sensed these things and all they
had meant for himself and others and
they bverbore him

  by god sir he choked  id like to
say- by god let me have a hand-
grip of a man of a man sir

  forward in the bitts well out of
sight three gay young greeks repre-

sentative of as many different frats
in the colleges social trust were hud-
dled only they were not remarkably
gay at that moment and they seemed
to take small comfort in each others
presence there were emotions upon
them as they sat gazing up the dim
track of the river which they could
scarce handle much less share

  there isnt a bunch in school that
wouldnt crawl on their bellies now to
get that chap dowd to join dont you
know it  murmured bunty

  course i know it responded hunk
wood say if we could only get
him

  you make me tired growled too-
tle cant you see a fellow like him
is too big lord-him in a frat fuss-
ing around with fudge and dames and
sofa cushions and dance cards show
me the bunch in this school fit to touch
him cept to black his shoes maybe

  back in the little wheel room pro-
fessor mccracken gave up his attempt
to make the neophyte talk with a very
human sigh of regret

  theres nothing to tell said curly
dowd shortly they all helped once
they got started you saw how they
worked

  i saw nodded the professor and
i can imagine what went before-i can
imagine after a fashion but about
yourself dowd i suppose you know
that every one of them is liable to be
expelled for what was done to you

  forget it returned curly dowd
in a very undutiful blaze nothing like
that professor if you think you owe
me or any of the rest of us anything
that dies right here me i guess ive
learned that a frat aint a place for
any lad that means to stand on his own
two feet like you said yourself im
glad i learned it and cheap at the
price

  as for them theyll be pretty good
fellers most of them-when they get
grown up

ix-the borrowed horses

after breakfast jonathan called
for their reckoning paid it and
asked the obsequious host what
weather there was out of doors

  a keen frost sir and the snow as
hard as ice

  so i thought from the weather
signs last night we shall need two
horses see that their shoes are sharp-
ened

  the host began explaining that they
could leave the horses at the crown
and thistle in carlisle when they
took the next stage forward but jona-
than cut him short they would need
their mounts for a longer period and
proposed in fact to buy them the
money in his purse was insufficient but
he and mauleverer were gentlemen of
the princes who must reach the main
army without delay and they would
give him a note of hand to be re-
deemed when there was a stuart on
the throne again

  nay that wont carry corn gentle-
men the prince-he came and he
went again and his grace of cumber-
land followed after and news comes
of hangings in carlisle im for king
george-his face on good money-and
not for any horse deals that go by note
o hand

  jonathan slipped his pistol out and
handled it with a carelessness that ap-

palled the host we commandeer the
horses then and you can whistle for
the note of hand its a trick i learned
from an officer of your side-a better
man than you or i-whos on his way
to america by now

  bustle host urged mauleverer
with his tired laugh

  when they were mounted and the
sharpened hoofs of their nags bit hard
into the frozen crust of snow and
they were away to recover a weeks
leave of absence jonathan had a
twinge of conscience

  that poor wretch of a host-the
tears were in his eyes to part with
two good horses-or the price of
them

  oh let him be hes fat and will
forget its the lean men standish
who take things overmuch to heart
it was surprising this ride of two
men who knew that they were hope-
lessly behind their own army-hope-
lessly behind cumberlands army that
marched six days ahead between the
stuart and themselves yet both were
well content the glamour that was
prince charles edwards and only his
drew them north through any peril
through any spite o the weather mak-
ing poetry of hardship

  the horses were fresh and they
reached penrith in good time the

town had gone to sleep again after its
wont though only a week since it had
been in the midst of battle-retreat-
ing highlanders and advance parties tf
the hanoverians and running fights all
up and down the streets

  they passed through after baiting
at the lonsdale tavern and neaped
a village five miles from carlisle they
were not so fit of body as they thought
and had been riding with the reticence
men show when each is ready to drop
and neither will confess it

  are you tired standish drawled
mauleverer

  getting no answer he glanced at his
companion and saw that he was fast
asleep in the saddle

  eh asked the other roused by a
sudden jolt of his horse

  oh i merely asked if you were
tired

  yes as the brook is tired of run-
ning where are we he added after
a sleepy pause

  on the great gay road my lad
where else

  to be sure assented standish
wide awake enough to laugh do you
know what i was dreaming maule-
verer just that i slept in a bed again
and neednt wake for twelve months
and a day i never had a finer dream
well im dead beat too shall we
halt at the first inn we come to
agreed comrade i want to re-
capture that good dream of mine

  they rode into the village the
moon touched snowy roofs and the
tinkling silver stream with poetry the
homestead lights shone ruddy across
the frosty street

  a good picture drawled maule-
verer we only need the waits and
church bells ringing in the distance and
father christmas here a little before
his time standish i was reared in k
fairy-tale-come-true village like this
on my honor i was i bleated to you
once you remember about the rectory

    

and the lavender and what not if
id stayed there eh instead of roam-
ing-why lad i might have been a par-
agon by this time

  you might assented jonathan
dryly

  and suddenly mauleverers voice
was gruff impatient oh its no time
for jesting old days are round me
like a cloud if id stayed in that west
country village so like this-if id
stayed-the old tired laugh returned
-why id have been just myself
standish it was better to hide my
roguery in town

  they came to an inn not so roomy
and suggestive of good cheer as last
nights lodging but a meal and a place
to sleep in was all they asked and they
found both indoors there was good
stabling for their horses too

  that night they had the recompense
that comes to men -who have fairly
earned it in the open they slept the
long deep slumber that children know
-a sleep that surrendered all into the
hands that made them it was pen-
ance to wake with the next dawn
roused by the hosts noisy thumping on
the door

  id have given the princes ransom
for another hour of sieep said mau-
leverer when they met for breakfast

  why didnt you sleep on then
snapped jonathan whose own temper
was nothing of the best

  oh some whim to keep tryst we
told fat boniface that we were to be
up at dawn and to be sure theres lee-
way to make up the stuart has a
weeks start of its already

  breakfast was not as punctual as
they were and they strolled out to see
how it fared with their borrowed
horses the dawn air was mild and
quiet with a smell of violets in it but
underfoot there was the crispness of a
keen night frost

  its good to be alive said jona-


new story magazine

than with all a countrymans zest in
the fragrance of a winters morn

  one supposes so for my part i
loathe your climate standish it nips
me to the bone

  oh it has a playful bite i own but
no harm in it-just a good watchdog
that keeps one at a distance

  as they came out of the stable after
seeing that all was well with their nags
the sharp tat-tat of hoofs sounded down
the street and a ruddy-faced man
mounted on a stout cob swung round
the corner and drew rein in the inn
yard the landlord bustled out and a
friendly grin ran in and about the port-
wine wrinkles of his face as he saw
who the newcomer was

  youve come for the christmas
fair then william he said i never
knew you miss our fat-stock sale save
once youd broken both legs that year
through a fall down your cellar steps
and it wasnt in reason to ask a man
i that case to come to a fair best
take your liquor at bottom of cellar
steps say i-theres not so far to fall
in case of accident

  w illiam responded with a touch of
spleen that old bygones ought to be
old bygones especially with christmas
coming on and the fat host asked
pleasantly how the world wagged with
his friend

  none so well grumbled william
i lost two horses yester morn a
couple o footsore men with a three
days growth on their chins had asked
a lodging overnight i gave it them
seeing theyd money in their pockets
though i wondered how theyd come by
their gains then next morn they turn
out to be whelps o this stuart army
thats gone north with its tail between
its legs theyd pistols they had and
so i had to let em steal th horses
aye theyre prime thieves these
charlies men agreed the other with
all an easy-going mans contempt for a
defeated cause that will be a sad

loss to ye william-as bad or near
thereby as breaking your two legs
down cellar steps

  a look of great craftiness stole into
williams eyes well as between
friends daniel it wasnt so much a
loss as a misfortune i swopped two
broken-winded horses good for nowt
save the price of hide and carcase for
yon stolen couple the chap who
swopped me was dithering in his cups
so im not so much what you call out o
pocket

  jonathan listening to all this from
the stable door laughed incontinently
he knew his own dalesmen so well
and these folk of cumberland were
not vastly different where a horse deal
was in case

  standish i used to laugh like that
said mauleverer nonchalantly one
pays for it i always fincl

  their host of yesterday turned
sharply whispered something to dan-
iel their host of to-day and there was
silence for a moment

  come on daniel said william
theyve left their pistols behind them
this time my two good horses are in-
side your stable yard

  it was two to two now and jona-
than growing accustomed to long
odds was perplexed by the simplicity of
the affair after all he had come
through on the road of his choice it
seemed childs play to met a fat host
who came -to him with naked fists but
this host had been the prime boxer
of the north before prosperity and
good living had loosened his strength
and now he remembered many ancient
tricks twice he felled standish who
rose with astonishing persistency and
caught daniel a wild cut across the jaw
but the return blow brought night ab-
solute to jonathan

  mauleverer fared no better at the
hands of william who was fighting for
the horses he had lost yesterday  and
when these two gentry of the princes
the open road



returned to knowledge of the world
about them they saw a press of vil-
lagers gathered round the two hosts
who had sheltered them on successive
nights

 what shall we do with them
asked william turning to the crowd

  put em in stocks came a voice
its lucky we have two sets o stocks
standing cheek by jowl together like
man and wife as a body might say
they should fratch by that token
once weve got em silting side by side

  thats a rare notion laughed an-
other of the crowd give em a taste
o prison before the sheriff comes to
hang em i was never one for stuart
charlie

 he lied when the march came
swirling south vlith the pipes rousing
echoes from every hill and crag he
had been for stuart charlie because
he saw some gain in it now when he
knew that carlisle castle garrisoned
by a forlorn hope had yielded to the
hanoverians he was a georges man

  jonathan hustled forward to the vil-
lage green got out of his sickness and
bewilderment blow hot-or cold you
lout he said i never liked the mid-
dle men

  then some one struck him on the
jaw and when this world opened diz-
zily again to him his feet were ham-
pered there was a jeering crowd
about him and he felt weak and hun-
gry presently out of the numbness
of heart and soul he realized that he
was sitting on wet ground with his
feet prisoned in the stocks and two
was company

  awake standish are you asked
mauleverer i never met a man who
got to sleep so easily when the worlds
not going very well

  where are we by your leave

  on the same gay road-where else
after all our ankles ached as much
when we walked the highway yester-
day-walked standish till i thought

we should never find horses again in
this world

 we found horses said jonathan
with a gust of laughter and were
here on that account these louts have
left our hands free after all you will
take a pinch of snuff with me

  ah thats a help sir they have
us by the heels they think but we dis-
dain them so long as we have snuff

 the way oi these two men here
for their gibes and ridicule began to
stir queer feelings in the crowd the
culprits took snuff with extreme preci-
sion and punctilio they talked to-
gether of the shower of sleet that was
drenching them to the skin and won-
dered if better weather were in the
making

  when a coward in the mob came for-
ward and began to tug at mauleverers
boots in preparation for the game of
tickling his feet until madness came
on him there were protests and two
or three of the village folk ran for-
ward

  let him be said jonathan and
they drew back surprised by his per-
sistent gayety

  as the coward got mauleverers right
boot off jonathan leaned over and
tapped him on the shoulder well
done he said and now a pinch of
snuff with me

  the man lifted his head and jona-
than dusted both eyes for him till he
whimpered that he would go blind for
the remainder of his days and the
crowd laughed liking the way of these
vagabonds who took their penance
gamely the worst of the horseplay
was over by tacit consent of the vil-
lagers  but they did not forget that
these two were horse thieves abhor-
rence of that form of robbery was in-
herent in their blood and they did not
loose their prisoners only they con-
tented themselves with gibes and ban-
ter instead of throwing missiles and
the change was pleasant


new story magazine

  we have not breakfasted said
jonathan fumbling in his pockets but
weve tobacco

  a meal in itself agreed maule-
verer

  the ground they sat on was chilly
and their legs were tilted toward the
sky but they lit their pipes and smoked
with a disarming grave tranquillity

  smoke while you may growled
one of the onlookers sheriff has
been sent for and hes a quick way with
horse thieves

  they smoked while they might and
passed a jest or two and found their
liking for each other thrive under this
discipline of raillery and great discom-
fort

  mauleverer turned by and by his
voice too low for the crowd to hear
im getting a grip of tother side of
things he said jeering at himself
ive earned this penance earned it
richly standish but you-what have
you done to deserve it

  im no galahad myself

  the other glanced at him then shook
with laughter if youre galahad
youve hit on a devilish fine disguise
standish if you could only see your-
self a four days beard a smear
across your forehead where the rotten
carrot hit you-and the galahad con-
cealed beneath it all

  into the midst of it all a post chaise
rattled by instinct jonathan knew
who was seated in it she had a knack
amounting almost to a passion of find-
ing him a masquerader and always
playing some part of comedy or farce

  the chaise went slowly through the
press of villagers and miss linstoke
leaned out to learn the meaning

  oh hurry postilion she said in
her brisk imperative way the judge
lies ill in carlisle and i must be at his
lodging  am late already

  she glanced about her saw the two
men in the stocks halted a moment in
sheer distrust of herself then she for-

got the judge and just as the postilion
was whipping forward in obedience to
a tongue he feared miss linstoke
opened the chaise door stepped lightly
into the sleety road and would have
fallen if a man had not clutched her by
the arm

  my thanks she said in her royal
way as she moved forward and stood
facing the two thieves

  mauleverer had talked lightly of
penance a while since in grim earnest
he found it now she saw and knew
him but as one remembers a face that
has passed out of heart if not out of
mind her glance sought jonathans
perhaps a four days beard and feet
pilloried in the stocks and what not
matter less to women than men think
at any rate mauleverer saw a light in
her eyes as if strong dawn were mov-
ing up the hills and in that light his
own liope went out for good and all
deep in the deep places of his soul his
clean love for this girl had taken roo
and thriven all that might have been
all the dull lifeless road ahead lay
stretched before him he suffered in
that moment as only strong men are
allowed to suffer if his sins were
many noised abroad wherever men had
heard of beau mauleverer his penance
was extreme here as he sat in the
stocks a figure for derision the fire ate
inward and consumed him

  he did not know as yet that to the
sinners on a grand scale is given a re-
pentance if they will take it planned on
the like big scae he simply sat there
his feet aching in the stocks and
thought the bitterness of death had
come he was mistaken the bit-
terness of life had reached him at long
last and his strength was in the mak-
ing

  miss linstoke stood in front of jon-
athan and mocked him are you the
prince to-day sir or simply a rogue in
the stocks your disguises are so
many
the open road



  i am as you see me said jonathan
briefly i stole two horses and the
sheriff has been summoned

  oh hbw consistent rogues are
first a guinea at the rylstone tollbar
then five guineas and a highwaymans
mask and now a common horse thief
your descent has been rapid mr
standish

  but gay assented jonathan
mauleverer here assures me that we
are on the great gay road we disguise
our happiness i own but that is lest
folk should envy us

  miss linstoke regarded him with
troubled pansy eyes then she turned
shaiiply to the crowd these gentle-
men go free she said release
them

  how can we with the sheriff sent
for horse thievings grave business
mistress choose how you look at it
aye fool so is the imprisonment of
men without fair trial i know these
gentlemen judge linstoke knows
them

  judge linstoke echoed the man
his effrontery gone weve heard of
judge linstoke hereabouts he gives
hard sentences

  yes to hardened rogues see you
there will be trouble if the sheriff
comes and finds these friends of mine
in the stocks

  from his very pain of heart maule-
verer found humor come to him you
put us here you yokels and youll have
to face the business were innocent
of course and the man who locked me
into this quaint pairbf boots will an-
swer for it if the sheriff is in good
humor hell only crop his ears for him
close to the head but otherwise therell
be the noose

  jonathan laughed in his haphazard
way but the villagers did not hear
they were daunted by this fine imagi-
native picture that miss linstoke and
mauleverer between them had drilled
into their brains

  the end of it was that the prisoners
were freed and they took no joy of
their freedom for a while no mans
legs are ready for a minuet on the high-
way just at once after the stocks have
numbed them they hobbled to the
inn recovered their sword belts and
pistols and when they came out again
knowing themselves armed they
moved with a firmer step

  you go to carlise miss linstoke
said jonathan so do we we can
give you safe-conduct when weve got
our hovses out of stable

  without let or hindrance they
crossed the yard and hustled the hostler
into some sort of speed in clapping
on the saddles the host accepting the
changed face of things as--indeed it
was his trade to do followed them with
many expressions of regret that their
stay in the village had been incom-
moded

  good for you host drawled mau-
leverer incommoded try an hour
or two in the stocks and youll not
be so nice of speech  promise you
standish youre fond of jests weve
been incommoded says fat boniface

  but jonathan had disappeared
though a moment since he had been
standing in the yard and miss lin-
stoke and mauleverer were left face to
face it angered him that she should
show no diffidence no sense of con-
straint as time went it was not long
since they had ridden together on the
gretna road as the souls clock reck-
ons time however many years had
passed she had crossed the barrier be-
tween girlish dreams and riper knowl-
edge and mauleverer was  shadow
no more no less moving across a world
of real folk

  lifes deuced odd miss linstoke
he said lamely

  life is surprising i admit but oh
so good to taste dreams are pleasant
and buttercups and daisies are good for

weaving into garlands but im tired of
childs play

  he felt himself swept aside not pet-
ulantly not with anger prompted by re-
gret but with a carelessness that was
not counterfeited

 why does not mr standish
come she asked presently he
knows that im in haste

  jonathan knew that she was in haste
but he was obsessed by the belief that
a few days growth on his chin mat-
tered he had gone into the inn and
found there a pert chambermaid and
had asked for a razor

   tis pity you should cut your
throat for any womans sake said the
maid demurely not one of us is
worth it

  standish in a high mood of serious-
ness was minded to be furious it was
absurd after these days of hardship
that his face and the way of his love
for miss- linstoke should be plain for
any tavern wench to read then the
unalterable humor of the road came
back to him

  not one of you is worth it-true
he assented cheerfully

  so then she pouted and when he
did not follow the lead her vanity had
given him she bridled but it was all
one to jonathan and in the end he
made his way to the hosts bedchamber
he shaved hurriedly but cleanly
washed odd stains of carrots and rotten
eggs from his face and stepped out
into the inn front with something of a
bridegrooms air

  sir youve delayed me snapped
miss linstoke why

  cannot you see said mauleverer
lazily he always learns a new trick
of fence when were together con-
trast his chin with mine

  coxcomb lead me to my chaise
she said with a little wayward smile

  they took the road these three as-
tonishing as the princes wild march to
the throne had been-and more as-

tounding the sudden mad retreat-
there was a quiet surprise too about
this five-mile journey to carlisle the
man thwarted of a bride at rylstone
tollbar the man who had fought for
the girls happiness were guarding the
chaise in which miss linstoke hurried
north and the two men were friends
though one of them so far as his heart
was concerned had taken a mortal
hurt x

  when they reached carlisle and the
judges lodging there miss linstoke
was insistent that both should come in
but mauleverer declined

  by your leave he said i have to
counter standishs attack i go in
search of a barber

  it was not raining in carlisle as it
happened gray sleet was falling in-
stead and through the murk of it mau-
leverer passed a fine upstanding figure
of a rogue

  he goes well said jonathan sharp
pity in his voice

  sir i shall never understand you
men she said as they went indoors
you always take each others part
what else is there to do were
simple folk hemmed in by women we
shall never understand

  you are clearly out of temper mr
standish she said will you wait
here and cool it while i run up to
see my father he may be well
enough to thank you for your escort
she did not find the judge in his bed-
room and ran out in great alarm on
the way downstairs she met her fath-
ers body servant an elderly fellow of
discretion and partial sobriety

  the judge is better mistress hes
downstairs with deviled kidneys and
a pint of claret in front of him he
has been asking for you very often
he is well enough to see you mr
standish she said as she reached the
hall claret and deviled kidneys are
always a sign of convalescence

  with the fugitive smile that half ad-
the open road



mitted him to friendship and half dis-
dained him she beckoned him into the
parlor on their right it was a room
paneled to the ceiling old with the
rustling ghosts of many judges who
had sipped their wine and jested here
when the days work was over judge
linstoke as he sat at the table the
ruddy hearth glow and the candlelight
playing round his square decisive face
was a figure to uphold the traditions of
his forbears

  ah here at last child he said
sharply it was well enough to pay
a call of duty for me  my kinsman
since i couldnt go myself but youve
taken a pretty time to drive five miles
out and home again

  she went to his side and ruffled his
stiff iron-gray hair with a liberty no
other dared have taken you to be
angry with me sir

  im at war with all mankind i tell
you isnt it enough to have gout in
the feet and gout in the bones and head
of me i tell you child  feel like
the bagpipes must do with one of char-
lies highlanders torturing them ive
heard a good deal of the music since
coming to carlisle and i know
jonathan doubtful of his welcome at
the first retreated still arther into the
shadowed door space there was such
confidence between these two such ripe
affection salted by humor that he felt
himself an intruder and an alien

  there child you look bonnie after
all said the judge presently-like
your mother when i first went wooing
and now shes dead and im- an old
man with gout

  illness had unsteadied judge lin-
stoke his voice broke for a moment
but he recovered gamely and filled him-
self a bumper heres to life he
said lifting his glass shes an odd
box o tricks but then so is a woman
that is wrhy were fond of both may-
be why were you so late in coming
child

  there were two rogues in the stocks
as we drove by

  and you stayed to help them out
you would ive spent the best part
of a lifetime in getting rogues safely
haltered and you spend yourtime free-
ing them i always said that women
live to undo a mans patient work
one of the rascals was named jon-
athan standish and father i wish
you had seen him with a chin like a
wayside tramps and the smear of a
broken carrot across his forehead i
did not stay to help him-not at first
-but merely to laugh in the midst of
these sad times

  they dared put standish in the
stocks snapped the judge i was
thinking much of him to-day full to
the brim of fantastical high motives-
a dreamer-but theres steel in the lads
spine where is he alison i need
him

  after the nightmare journeys of
these past days-after ambush fight
and skirmish-after that walk with
mauleverer over a road hollowed out
by the passing of two armies its pools
frozen so hard that their ankles all but
broke at every step-after it all jona-
than found himself seated at a good
table with warmth and friends beside
him

  miss linstoke was pleased to minis-
ter to his thirst and hunger though he
protested he was a dreamer as the
judge had said and while he ate and
drank he was aware that this girl with
the pansy eyes had brought the swift
beat of angels wings into his life

  alison told me that your chin was
like a tramps said the judge break-
ing up a silence that was growing bur-
densome when did you find time
to shave

  at the inn sir

 good a man who can think of
his chin between the stocks and the
gallows is a man i like to meet youre
aware standish that this rising is over


new story magazine

and done with youre aware that
every step you take in carlisle streets
is shadowed by the government i
serve 

  like a knife at his heart jonathan
felt a pain he did not understand until
in leisure he could remember his meet-
ings with charles edward-the
strength and grace of a man in whom
kingship was inborn

  it shall not fail theres to be a
battle soon or late-

  take an old mans word for it it
was a high endeavor lad and it failed
because it aimed too high for this

world in the next- oh fill your

glass standish im too old and gouty
to guess where stuart charles will
stand when the trump o judgment
comes besides it would be treason-
able to the government i serve

  when standish asked what had hap-
pened during the past week it was
miss linstoke who told the tale for
him she spoke quickly as one who
had witnessed tragic scenes and did
not care to dwell too long on them

  my father after the assizes fell
ill and we stayed here i saw the
brave defeated army march into the
town i saw the prince his face gay
like sunlight through the rain they
spent a night here and then colonel
towneley volunteered to hold the cas-
tle to give the retreat a respite and
the prince would not listen till they
persuaded him that his highlanders
would have a better chance of safety
if i were towneleys wife i should be
proud

  alisons keen for the high endeav-
or too said the judge oh how you
youngsters cry for the moon and will
not rest until you fall to earth again

  the castle held out for two days
and after that they brought towneley
out into the market square they
asked him if he would recant his stuart
faith and he lifted his head to the rain

and said he hoped to die like a gen-
tleman

  fine murmured the judge fine
and quixotic standish towneley
seems to have been a bit of a dreamer
too one always pays for dreams i
tell you-sometimes with ones head
miss linstoke stood there in the can-
dlelight slim and eager if i were
towneleys wife she repeated i
should be proud i should shed tears
at his grave-tears of sheer happiness
to go into the castle waiting there for
death when he might have taken his
chance in the open-to care nothing at
all so long as he served his prince-
there are few of his breed left and
none among the younger men

  jonathan was roused he had no
great faith in himself-rather a sort of
humorous contempt of what he thought
his easy-going nature-but he was the
one man here to stand for the younger
generation i take up your challenge
give me a second hazard of the kind
and ill accept it

  at a price said miss linstoke
with daintiest irony is it a guinea
this time or a pile of gold or a minuet
on the highway no highwayman
does anything without his price

  she had stung him into fury unex-
pectedly and was dismayed by the re-
sult as women are standish leaned
his hands on the table his eyes ablaze
and level with her own yes ive
my price-your heart to wear on my
sleeve good for men to see

  daws might peck at it

 once said standish grimly
afterward theres a way to treat peck-
ing daws

  the three of them were silent from
sheer astonishment the fever and
unrest of the times were on them and
shams were swept aside jonathan had
broken all rules of conduct by stating
without reserve or casual lying how
his own heart stood

  it was the judge who broke up the
the open road



tension he began to laugh and
laughed more and more until his eyes
were weak with tears alison he
said at last it is the most diverting
offer of marriage ever heard of youll
have to pledge yourself to this adven-
turer theres a look of will-not-be-de-
nied about him

  she did not smile-simply stood
there her glance meeting jonathans
then her brows lifted with the old dis-
dain have you ten guineas at com-
mand father she asked

  oh i suppose so child why
ransom me by your leave this
adventurer is rising in the world and
one guinea will not bribe him now
she curtsied to her father and was
gone leaving a nip of east wind in the
room

  its droll standish how women
hug a grievance alison knows she
was well rid of that gretna business
--knows youd rather meet the heads-
man than a bribe-but she wont get
the rankle out of her mind the best
of them are like that

  do you let me win her sir ive
my sword and a house called wuth-
rums smothered in debt and some
knowledge of the open road to be
honest that is all i have

  the judge drummed with his fingers
on the table then he took a pinch of
snuff

  standish he said its true that a
man gets what he wants if he prays
stark and constant for it for twenty
years i neded a son and none came till
you met us at the rylstone tollgate
then you went like a puff of wind
following this mad fellow of a stuart
and i missed you i never wanted any
man about me as i wanted you three
hours ago

  im here sir entirely at your serv-
ice

  theres a grim north-country physi-
cian here in carlisle whos been attend-

ing me he came this morning
thumped me about and asked whether
i liked truth or lies i explained to
him that liking for the truth was inborn
in me then he said bluntly what ailed
me and gave me a month to live with
care so i got up of course and said
in that case id have deviled kidneys
and a pint of claret if physicians
could give me only a month of slops
and lying on a bed id mortgage the
inheritance

  sir it is not as bad as that pro-
tested jonathan

  oh no sympathy  ive seen life
and im ready to lie down and get to
sleep therell be a better waking on
the morrow lad

  jonathan did not know what he said
-the words ran out of their own ac-
cord he stood so close to his own
fathers death so close to the perils
that had followed thick on each others
heels that his heart spoke unchecked
speed of action not time as the clock
marks it had brought these two into
a close relationship

  so that is your feeling said the
judge dryly it seems ive found a
son at last the pity is that we have to
say good-by so soon

  then he talked of his daughter of
the unsettled times whichever way
this warfare ended the towns and high-
ways would be filled with the jackals
who always prowl on the outskirts of
honest fight

  in brief standish you won her at
the rylstone tollgate finish the ride
gretnas just over the border forgive
the bluntness a dying man does not
waste time

  the wonder of it the simplicity cap-
tured jonathan he wasted one whole
minute in a dream

  you are forgetting miss linstoke
in this matter he said by and by

  true women are so odd heres
a dying man wanting her safety and a
youngster wanting her happiness and
	new story magazine

a bedlam of charlies men and georges
men cutting each others throats and
alison will ask to be wooed-here a
dropped glove and there a box on the
ear and then six months of withdraw-
als and advances and what not theres
no time for it i tell you

  at jonathans heart the little lamp
he carried there burned suddenly to
flame by your leave sir she does
not give me her regard that is all
why talk of it

  so then the judge canceled twenty
years he had loved alisons mother
in just this fashion a little absurdly
a little too finely for this worlds give
and take but with a strength that abode
with him still

  are you pledged to the princes
cause he asked

  ive done the last errand he gave
me but im pledged to him

  youll not stay till claret and dev-
iled kidneys have shortened my leve
here jonathan i want you about me
theyre a week and a day ahead of you
those misguided highlanders will you
not be about me just for this little
while 

  the call of the open road was in his
ears again but a lame dog needed him
and he stayed on

  miss linstoke came in presently and
stood half between the door and the
candlelight ten guineas would not
bribe him she asked her voice danger-
ously quiet offer him twenty then
the judge was his own man again
alison he said i entertain an hon-
ored guest get up to your nursery and
pray-for manners child if youd
had grace to be a boy id have known
how to lick you into shape

  late that evening when the judge
was abed and sleeping tranquilly stan-
dish went out into the carlisle streets
there was sleet underfoot and a driv-
ing wind but these were better than the
stifled indoor air he made his way
to the castle a light burned here and

there throwing the squat unlovely
front into darker outline for jona-
than the place was lit with glamour
here towneley had gone to certain
death here he had come out to meet
the fate he coveted till time ended
carlisle would be haloed bythe story of
one gallant gentleman and of the for-
lorn hope for which he did not fear to
die

  his heart ached for scotland ached
to follow the army pressing north why
had he agreed to be tied by the leg here
because an old man needed him  there
was room and freedom yonder and a
chance to play the man

  one was born a fool i suppose
said jonathan with his gentlest laugh
undoubtedly that is the explanation

  he pictured rousing battles across the
border perils by night and day that he
might have undertaken for the prince
the stride of a good horse under him
eating up the miles and he had bar-
tered it all for attendance on a dying
man  the young blood in him rebelled
was he a priest or doctor to stay on
here when battle was singing like a pi-
broch to him 

  in the quiet of the night he remem-
bered his hot challenge to miss lin-
- stoke that he too would go into dark-
ness as towneley had done if she
would point the way for him she had
not pointed the way but the judge had

  it came to him down from the star-
lit sky this knowledge of the enterprise
so towneley had felt when he volun-
teered to go into carlisle castle instead
of meeting happier perils in the open
yet towneley stayed

   jonathan for the first time in his life
knew true humility the roots of which
are grounded in common thrifty earth
and its flowers later on are white as
knighthood if towneley had been con-
tentsto be tied by the leg why not a
lesser man 

  he turned at last to seek the judges
lodging not fifty paces away he saw
the open road



the cloaked figure of a man blurred in
the starshine and the cloudy moonlight
and his hand reached down for his pis-
tol the figure glided out before him
and was lost in the narrow windings of
the street

  another jackal standish muttered
faith how they loathe the sight of a
pistol muzzle

  the next morning judge linstoke
woke with an insistent cry for jona-
than he was weak and shaken-a
child whose needs must be ministered
to at once when standish came he
was content and slept again and so
this siege went on-the siege under-
taken in glad memory of colonel
towneley-until jonathan began to
know what lack of sleep meant
sleep waited for him at every turn it
threw dust in his eyes when he was
striving to keep eyelids open  it tempted
him to lay down his courage and sell
his manhood for an hours forgetful-
ness he could not yield the judge
needed him that was all day by day
the knowledge gained on him that he
was priest and doctor both nursing a
sick man back to health he gave of
his strength and judge linstoke sucked
it up as a thirsty man drinks water
and jonathan lost flesh but the pa-
tient asked oftener for claret and a
good cut from the joint and that was
so much to the good

  whenever standish got out for a run

in the open he was aware of a cloaked
figure shadowing him the figure would
not come within pistol distance and
the stealthiness of it all would have
troubled him at usual times but to
jonathan sick of inaction within doors
the hazard was a stimulus he kept his
pistols ready and grew to love this
jackal who shared his night walks with
him

  he met miss linstoke often these
days and he had not guessed till now
that a womans temper could be forged
of such brittle steel she was waspish
it seemed as if the sting of the old
serpent that once wrecked eden had
got into her tongue

  on the fourth day of-this enterprise
after jonathan had given out his
strength in the sick room upstairs and
was proposing to eat a good meal be-
fore going out of doors he met miss
linstoke on the stair

  you serve the judge very well
she said withdrawing her skirts from
him as if he had the plague what is
your price nowadays

 jonathans easy-going temper
snapped he looked her up and down
and laughed just to forget you miss
linstoke

  her eyes grew soft and pleading
he felt as if he had hurt a child but
by some gift of common sense he let
the feeling go and passed out into the
hazard of the carlisle streets
clendenning

by hugh johnson

li ad the lot of horace clendenning
fallen among samaritans he
might have been a sexton-and he
would have been a faithful one but
it fell among thieves and he became a
military convict with a twenty-year
term to serve

  i have seen several of that precious
gang of nineteenth century free com-
panions that by some quirk of fate
coalesced in d troop of the fiftieth
and traced the name that delighted
them-the forty thieves-across the
island of luzon they fought like
fiends and their devil of a captain-
he has long since been cashiered-used
to boast that he could ride with them
from one end of the island to the other
-insurrectos or no insurrecjos the
filipinos used to cross themselves at
the sound of the troops hoofs thud-
ding across the dry rice paddles

  how they kept out of trouble so
long i do not know such a hard
riding and fearless troop was worth a
regiment on advance guard but when
they looted the great cathedral at bon-
toc and strung the sacristan up by the
thumbs until he told them where he
had hidden the chalices-that was too
much they went before a red terror
of a court martial that tfhinned their
ranks as effectively as a level sheet of
shrapnel could have done that was
how clendenning got his sentence i
do not know what his place was in the
forty thieves but he must have been
a holder of horses a stander-by to
watch i knew him in the big military
prison of san leandro- in southern
california and there he drove a mule
cart

  you may see sorae men at their work
and know that they have struck their

level-that they lit their task completely
and that nothing else would have suited
them so well

  such was clendennings condition as
he shuffled along in rear of the san
leandro garbage cart his stable broom
slanting across his shoulder his weak
blue eyes on the ground alert for the
slightest swirl of dust the tiniest scrap
of paper a remark upon the immac-
ulate condition of the prison grounds
was enough to make him flush with
pleasure he was boastful and vain-
glorious concerning the amount of gar-
bage he removed it was his belief
that no such animal a jerry the sev-
enteen-hand army mule that drew the
cart had ever been foaled the brasses
of his harness were always spotless
and the leather as soft as kid

  jerry was worth going far to see
by what telepathy it was done i canno
tell but that mule always stopped with-
out a signal at precisely the proper
spot always started  the necessary
instant and at the end of a tour toiled
up the wooden ramp to the garbage
chute backed into position and waited
for clendenning to spring the lever

  clendenning had no friends among
the prisoners he was too colorless
for them i doubt if he missed their
companionship-he had his mule he
talked to that brute confided in him
and in the dusk of the stalls at feed-
ing time crooned over him caressed
him and gave him the love for which
every human being must have an out-
let somewhere

  it was my business to talk to the
prisoners to hear their stories and to
do what i could for them-i felt no
professional jealousy of the mule-and
but for something that happened dur-
clendenning



ing the second year of my tour of dutj
at san leandro i should have gone
away certain that no fate could have
made clendenning more content and
that few men were in truth happier

  he got permission to speak to me
one night and since he was trusted
anywhere within the walls i received
him in my study instantly i knew
i hat some unusual news had come to
him his old look of placidity was
gone his shallow face with its negli-
gible chin was twisted in a look of
frantic anxiety

  well clendenning i said as kindly
as i could what can i do for you

  chapling he whispered edging
closer to me i gotta git out-see-
yotta-just gotta thats all

  at last he showed me a letter that
had somehow been smuggled to him
and stood fidgeting his cap between his
big bony hands and shuffling from side
to side like an uneasy animal while i
read it

  it was dated iloilo on the letter-
head of a british mercantile company
favorite husband of my dearest it
began and having seen many similar
compositions i seemed to glimpse the
picture of a bespectacled filipino shoe
hombre his tongue in his cheek and a
visayan-spanish-english vade mecum
open on the desk beside him

  favorite husband of my dearest long
time that i do not write on you since when
account per guards of those prison where
you are accommodate nothing percolate sad-
ness to conversation it mister

  those pequenious fortune of moneys that
you are leaving are expend sad are i to so
since remark about arrival of these little son
of yours thus absolved of the food which
we eat therefore you should to borrow me
five or nine hundred pesos by quick come
back of mail much obliged mister of those
funds we are needing him oh how sorrow

  that you are not acquainting of the
friendly son we describe he sojourn on me
after you go so sadly and pesos are require
to eat it everyday in the morning he look-
ing like you mister and those moneys pos-
sible to come by swiftness oh beautiful

  we are starving in disgustedness mister
and pesos are expecting themselves you bet
loving with thoughts your angel wife of
beauty sad with pesos

symprosa clendenning

i did not look up i did not wish
to hurt him by saying what i thought

  have you any money i finally
managed

  she had it all he growled ten
thousand pesos

  ten thousand pesos i didnt be-
lieve him

  loot sir-that was a small share-
some of the boys had twicet as much
well wasnt that enough i did
not care to hear his confessions

  sure it was enuff-it was moren
nuff she was just-a squaw

 well-

  but a baby sir me with a baby
she says so in the letter didnt you
see an it looks like me

  this was a new side to the business
and i inspected him closely-nothing
but sincerity i had thought you could
scrape clendenning dry with a figu-
rative spoon and find no more than a
desire for three meals a day and a
mechanism designed to do the bidding
of a stronger will than his there was
more the man was simple as a lever
and fulcrum but he had the power
to love some one beside himself very
deeply

  ill do what i can for you clen-
denning i promised ill take it up
ive been thinking of doing it for some
time ill try for a pardon

  instantly his round face became pyri-
form

  take it up he groaned take it
up thatll be months

  yes i said at least-but youve
a good chance

  i could fairly see resolve come into
his face

  it wont do by g- i mean-beg

yer pardon chapling


new story magazine

  see here clendenning i warned
dont go away planning any foolish-
ness youd just spoil every chance
youve got

  he seemed to think i had some power
to help him for suddenly he burst out
in a torrent of words that only intense
excitement could have evolved from
him

  my gawd chapling-i aint never
had nawthin-not nawthin i was
found on a doorstep and since then
nobody but you wots paid to do it
never had nothin for me but a kick er
a command nobody never so much
as smiled unless they was after some-
thin

  it never hurt much chapling-the
kicks seemed like i was built for
em i never snarled back-not me
but i never had nawthin nor nobuddy
to call my own and i wanted em

  poor devil-he made that clear
enough he was standing with his
bony hands outstretched his inconse-
quent face contorted by an effort to
suppress tears

  but here ive got a baby-a son of
my own to look up at me mebbe he
is half brown hell need me hes
mine hell grin at me and wait for
me to come home and want me and
ill work for him they aint nawthin
i wont do ill-

  he stopped so suddenly that i fol-
lowed his glance in a direction across
my shoulder even my study windows
were barred with a lattice of chilled
steel

  he covered his face and sobbed

  after he was gone i wrote two let-
ters one a formal recommendation for
clendennings pardon the other to the
lieutenant of the fifty-first at iloilo
asking for what news he could gather
of symprosa clendenning the iloilo
letter required two months for an an-
swer and there is  hurrying a par-
don recommendation there was noth-

ing for clendenning to do but to pos-
sess himself in patience and to wait

  he couldnt do it he began to get
marks against his a-i rating the
prison commandant said to me one day
your pardon recommendation is go-
ing to be twelve hundred and forty-
twos undoing without that hed have
gone on with his old mule happy and
contented hes restless now and lies
taking up with that old d troop gang
theyre bad actors

  had i been astute enough i would
have reported the iloilo letter right
then and there but i hadnt been in
the prison business long enough to at-
tach the proper importance to such
slight indications clendenning avoided
me too-that should have been a warn-
ing i had only one other conversa-
tion with him before matters came to
a very serious head he wanted to
know about the progress of his pardon
suit and all i could say was

  no news clendenning have you
heard any more

  he said

  no but i had one of those queer
intuitions that the men call hunches
that he was lying and that for some
-reason of his own he would confide
in me no more the reason was that
he and some ten other military con-
victs had planned one of the most dar-
ing prison deliveries that san leandro
ever had to frustrate

  they had outside confederates who
had in some manner smuggled to them
enough hexagonal pierced-grain big-
gun powder from the naval station on
the bay ten miles down the estuary
to blow the whole prison to smithereens
the plan was this

  the garbage chutes open through
hoppers that hang over the estuary
under these the city garbage scows
stop on their way out to sea the
chutes open from a platform about ten
feet above the prison yard and this
platform is approached by two ramps
clendenning



the space beneath the platform is in-
closed by concrete walls and is utilized
as the prison tool house two men
work here sharpening axes and saws
and counting and receiving the tools
from the working parties

  on the prison wall just above is a
caponier or little guardhouse where is
mounted an automatic machine gun that
sweeps the assembly yard from its
swivel at five-thirty in the evening
the men from the furniture factory
across the yard are just forming to
march back to retreat the two tool-
house men lock their door and clen-
denning is dumping his last cartload
into the chutes

  the powder was placed against the
outer wall of the tool house a slow
fuse of twisted rags dampened with
kerosene was so to time the explosion
that it would occur when all of the
groups were at a safe distance from
the tool house the quantity of powder
insured a breach in the river wall the
destruction of the caponier and gun
and an excellent opportunity for es-
cape to any of some hundred and fifty
convicts who cared to make the at-
tempt

  it worked beautifully to the very
last second i was in the prison yard
when jerry came toiling in through the
east gate the sentry over clenden-
ning stepped aside as the iron doors
shut and stood pumping the cartridges
out of his gun while jerry clenden-
ning slouching along beside him ambled
across the yard turned at the chute and
labored up the incline

  every man was perfectly schooled
in his part the tool-house men came
out closed their door and stepped into
position for the lock step across the
yard over in front of the furniture
factory the long butternut brown queue
of tired convicts was forming to march
away then the first critical incident
was passed over smoothly enough

  the moment clendenning sprung his

dumping lever a resounding thump
sounded from the platform it caused
every one to glance in that direction
and was followed by a suppressed and
decorous murmur of laughter the off
wheel of the garbage cart had worked
off the axle and now with increasing
velocity went spinning down the ramp
toward the stables clendenning stood
a moment with a look of perplexed
stupidity on his face then glanced at
the grinning guard in the caponier and
received permission to go after it the
wheel struck and rebounded from the
concrete stabli wall and lay rocking
on its hub when clendenning reached it

  the furniture gang had formed by
that time and the tool-house men were
halfway across the yard i was not
the only person to be struck by clen-
dennings peculiar attitude at that in-
stant

  he had stooped over for hi wheel
and had ceased movement as though
suddenly frozen in that position back
bent hand outstretched eyes turned
upward from his task in a look of
awful horror

  all that i could discover to educe
such emotion was the form of jerry
silhouetted against the evening sky as
he peered over the edge of the plat-
form above the tool house his hammer
head drooped dejectedly his long ears
limply forward in a pose of deathless
sadness and inscrutable yearning but
something had electrified clendenning
he dashed across the sanded prison
yard toward the tool-house door and
to the guards frightened command

  halt he yelled fire and stood
clawing a moment at the latch

  sure enough a thin eddy of blue
smoke came curling out through the
opening and when i reached it i could
see clendenning furiously tossing aside
the corded picks and shovels at the far
side of the room a tongue of flame
sputtering around his feet look-
ing over his shoulder he yelled at me


new story magazine

  get out you fool-its giant pow-
der

  but in the excitement i didnt com-
prehend and when i did the cold sweat
fairly wet my hair clendenning had
kicked out the fuse and scattered some
small brown canvas bags each filled
with big honeycombed hexagons of
nitro explosive

  i didnt feel particularly kindly to-
ward him or very sorry that the court
that tried him added ten years to his
sentence but it was a painful duty to
read to him the answer to my iloilo
letter from irreverent fleming of the
fifty-first

  -there is a symprosa and she used to

be clendenning her friendly sou is i fear
a child of the imagination of pedro salacar
her present consort she has been married
some eight times since the solemnization of
the clendenning nuptials

  pedro is the affable monte dealer at the
fan-tan parlors of our progressive fellow
townsman looey sing late of macao portu-
guese china and i suspect that it is he and
not symprosa who is sad with pesos-

  he looked at me with a slight quiver
of his weak chin that calmed after a
moment

  chapling he said i been moren
half suspicionin somethin like that
ever since the scheme fell through
aint people jest meanern hell

  i	had no comment to make upon this
generality and he apparently desired
none for after a moment of deep
thought he asked

  the stable orderly says that mules
sometimes lives for fifty years do
you know if thats true

  my answer seemed to give him per-
fect peace for i told him that they
often did
