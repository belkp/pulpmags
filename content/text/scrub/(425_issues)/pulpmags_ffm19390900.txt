  listerine antiseptic famous for
 years as a mouth wash and
gargle succeeds so brilliantly in
controlling dandruff because it
gives scalp hair and hair follicles
an antiseptic bath which removes
ugly flakes and kills the queer

  start with listerine antiseptic
and continue the treatments
regularly results will delight and

amaze you no other remedy that
we know of has such a clinical

chapter i

the throckmartin mystery

am breaking a long silence to clear
the name of dr david throckmartin
and to lift the shadow of scandal
from that of his wife and of dr charles
stanton his assistant that i have not
found the courage to do so before all
men who are jealous of their scientific

reputations will understand when they have
read the facts entrusted to me alone

  i shall first recapitulate what has
actually been known of the throckmartin
expedition to the island of ponape in the
carolines-the throckmartin mystery as
it is called

  dr throckmartin set forth you will
recall to make some observations of
nan-matal that extraordinary group of
island ruins remains of a high and pre-


the moon pool



historic civilization that are clustered
along the east shore of ponape with him
went his wife to whom he had been wedded
less than half a year the daughter of pro-
fessor frazier-smith she was as deeply
interested and almost as well informed as
he upon these relics of a vanished race
that titanically strew certain islands of
the pacific and form the basis for the
theory of a submerged pacific continent

  mrs throckmartin it will be recalled
was much younger fifteen years at least
than her husband dr charles stanton
who accompanied them as dr throck-
martins assistant was about her age
these three and a swedish woman thora
helversen who had been edith throck-
martins nurse in babyhood and who was
entirely devoted to her made up the ex-
pedition

  dr throckmartin planned to spend a
year among the ruins not only of ponape
but of lele-the twin centers of that colos-
sal riddle of humanity whose answer has
its roots in immeasurable antiquity a
weird flower of man-made civilization that
blossomed ages before the seeds of egypt
were sown of whose arts we know little
and of whose science and secret knowledge
of nature nothing

  he carried with him complete equip-
ment for his work and gathered at ponape
a dozen or so natives for laborers they
went straight to metalanim harbor and set
up their camp on the island called uschen-
tau in the group known as the nan-matal
you will remember that these islands are
entirely uninhabited and are shunned by
the people on the main island

  three months later dr throckmartin
appeared at port mooresby papua he
came on a schooner manned by solomon
islanders and commanded by a chinese
half-breed captain he reported that he
was on his way to melbourne for additional
scientific equipment and whites to help him
in his excavations saying that the supersti-
tion of the natives made their aid negligible
he went immediately on board the steamer
southern queen which was sailing that
same morning three nights later he dis-

appeared from the southern queen and it
was officially reported that he had met
death either by being swept overboard or
by casting himself into the sea

  a relief-boat sent with the news to
ponape found the throckmartin camp on
the island uschen-tau and a smaller camp
on the island called nan-tanach all the
equipment clothing supplies were intact
but of mrs throckmartin of dr stanton
or of thora helversen they could find not
a single trace

  the natives who had been employed by
the archeologist were questioned they
said that the ruins were the abode of great
spirits-ani-who were particularly power-
ful when the moon was at the full on
these nights all the islanders were doubly
careful to give the ruins wide berth upon
being employed they had demanded leave
from the day before full moon until it was
on the wane and this had been granted
them by dr throckmartin thrice they
had left the expedition alone on these
nights on their third return they had
found the four white people gone and they
knew that the ani had eaten them they
were afraid and had fled

  that was all

  the chinese half caste was found and
reluctantly testified at last that he had
picked dr throckmartin up from a small
boat about fifty miles off ponape the
scientist had seemed half mad but he had
given the seaman a large sum of money to
bring him to port moresby and to say if
questioned that he had boarded the boat
at ponape harbor

  that is all that has been known to
anyone of the fate of the throckmartin
expedition

  why you will ask do i break silence
now and how came i in possession of the
facts i am about to set forth

  to the first i answer i was at the
geographical club recently and i over-
heard two members talking they men-
tioned the name of throckmartin and i
became an eavesdropper one said

  of course what probably happened was
that throckmartin killed them all its a


famous fantastic mysteries

dangerous thing for a man to marry a
woman so much younger than himself and
then throw her into the necessarily close
company of exploration with a man as
young and as agreeable as stanton was
the inevitable happened no doubt
throckmartin discovered avenged himself
then followed remorse and suicide
throckmartin didnt seem to be that
kind said the other thoughtfully

  no he didnt agreed the first

  isnt there another story went on
the second speaker something about mrs
throckmartin running away with stanton
and taking the woman thora with her
somebody told me they had been recog-
nized in singapore recently

  you can take your pick of the two
stories replied the other man its one or
the other i suppose

  it was neither one nor the other of them
i know-and i will answer now the sec-
ond question-because i was with throck-
martin when he-vanished i know what
he told me and i know what my own eyes
saw incredible abnormal against all the
known facts of our science as it was i
testify to it and it is my intention after
this is published to sail to ponape to go
to the nan-matal and to the islet beneath
whose frowning walls dwells the mystery
that throckmartin sought and found-and
that at the last sought and found throck-
martin 

  i will leave behind me a copy of the map
of the islands that he gave me also
his sketch of the great courtyard of nan-
tanach the location of the moon door his
indication of the probable location of the
moon pool and the passage to it and his
approximation of the position of the shin-
ing globes if i do not return and there are
any with enough belief scientific curiosity
and courage to follow these will furnish
a plain trail

  i will now proceed straightforwardly
with my narrative

  for six months i had been on the
dentrecasteaux islands gathering data for
the concluding chapters of my book upon
flora of the volcanic islands of the south

pacific the day before i had reached
port moresby and had seen my specimens
safely stored on board the southern queen
as i sat on the upper deck that morning
i thought with homesick mind of the long
leagues between me and melbourne and the
longer ones between melbourne and new
york

  it was one of papuas yellow mornings
when she shows herself in her most somber
most baleful mood the sky was a smolder-
ing ocher over the island brooded a spirit
sullen implacable and alien filled with the
threat of latent malefic forces waiting to be
unleashed it seemed an emanation from
the untamed sinister heart of papua her-
self-sinister even when she smiles and
now and then on the wind came a breath
from unexplored jungles filled with un-
familiar odors mysterious and menacing

  it is on such mornings that papua
speaks to you of her immemorial ancient-
ness and of her power i am not unduly
imaginative but it is a mood that makes me
shrink-i mention it because it bears di-
rectly upon dr throckmartins fate nor
is the mood papuas alone i have felt it
in new guinea in austraila in the solo-
mons and in the carolines but it is in
papua that it seems most articulate it
is as though she said i am the ancient
of days i have seen the earth in the throes
of its shaping i am the primeval i have
seen races born and die and lo in my
breast are secrets that would blast you by
the telling you pale babes of a puling
age you and i ought not be in the same
world yet i am and i shall be never
will you fathom me and you i hate though
i tolerate i i tolerate-but how long

  and then i seem to see a giant paw
that reaches from papua toward the outer
world stretching and sheathing monstrous
claws

  all feel this mood of hers her own peo-
ple have it woven in them part of their
web and woof flashing into light unex-
pectedly like a soul from another universe
masking itself as swiftly

  i fought against papua as every white
man must on one of her yellow mornings
the moon pool



and as i fought i saw a tall figure come
striding down the pier behind him came
a kapa-kapa boy swinging a new valise
there was something familiar about the
tall man as he reached the gangplank he
looked up straight into my eyes stared at
me for a moment and waved his hand
it was dr throckmartin

  coincident with my recognition of him
there came a shock of surprise that was
definitely-unpleasant it was throckmar-
tin-but there was something disturbingly
different about him and the man i had
known so well and had bidden farewell
less than a year before he was then as
you know just turned forty lithe erect
muscular the face of a student and of a
seeker his controlling expression was one
of enthusiasm of intellectual keenness of
-what shall i say-expectant search his
ever eagerly questioning brain had stamped
itself upon his face

  i sought in my mind for an explanation
of that which i had felt on the flash of his
greeting hurrying down to the lower deck
i found him with the purser as i spoke
he turned and held out to me an eager
hand-and then i saw what the change
was that had come over him

  he knew of course by my face the un-
controllable shock that my closer look had
given me his eyes filled and he turned
briskly to the purser then hurried off to
his stateroom leaving me standing half
dazed

  at the stair he half turned

  oh goodwin he said id like to
see you later just now-theres something
i must write before we start-

  he went up swiftly

   e looks rather queer-eh said the
purser know im well sir seems to
ave given you quite a start sir

  i made some reply and went slowly to
my chair i tried to analyze what it was
that had disturbed me so what profound
change in throckmartin that had so
shaken me now it came to me it was
as though the man had suffered some ter-
rific soul searing shock of rapture and
horror combined some soul cataclysm that

in its climax had remolded his face deep
from within setting on it the seal of
wedded joy and fear as though indeed
ecstasy supernal and terror infernal had
once come to him hand in hand taken
possession of him looked out of his eyes
and departing left behind upon him in-
eradicably their shadow

  alternately i looked out over the port
and paced about the deck striving to read
the riddle to banish it from my mind
and all the time still over papua brooded
its baleful spirit of ancient evil unfathom-
able not to be understood nor had it lifted
when the southern queen lifted anchor
and steamed out into the gulf

chapter ii

down the moon path

i watched with relief the shores sink
down behind us welcomed the touch
of the free sea wind- we seemed to be
drawing away from something malefic
something that lurked within the island
spell i have described and the thought
crept into my mind spoke-whispered
rather-from throckmartins face

  i had hoped-and within the hope was
an inexplicable shrinking an unexpressed
dread-that i would meet throckmartin at
lunch he did not come down and i was
sensible of a distinct relief within my
disappointment all that afternoon i
lounged about uneasily but still he kept
to his cabin nor did he appear at dinner

  dusk and night fell swiftly i was warm
and went back to my deck-chair the
southern queen was rolling to a disquieting
swell and i had the place to myself

  over the heavens was a canopy of cloud
glowing faintly and testifying to the moon
riding behind it there was much phos-
phorescence now and then before the
ship and at the sides arose those strange
little swirls of mist that steam up from the
southern ocean like the breath of sea mon-
sters whirl for a moment and disappear
i lighted a cigarette and tried once more to
banish throckmartins face from my mind


famous fantastic mysteries

  suddenly the deck door opened and
through it came throckmartin himself he
paused uncertainly looked up at the sky
with a curiously eager intent gaze hesi-
tated then closed the door behind him

  throckmartin i called come sit
with me its goodwin

  immediately he made his way to me
sitting beside me with a gasp of relief that
i noted curiously his hand touched mine
and gripped it with a tenseness that hurt
his hand was icelike i puffed up my cig-
arette and by its glow scanned him closely
he was watching a large swirl of the mist
that was passing before the ship the
phosphorescence beneath it illumined it
with a fitful opalescence i saw fear in his
eyes the swirl passed he sighed his grip
relaxed and he sank back

  throckmartin i said wasting no time
in preliminaries whats wrong can i
help you

  he was silent

  is your wife all right and what are you
doing here when i heard you had gone to
the carolines for a year i went on

  i felt his body grow tense again he did
not speak for a moment and then

  im going to melbourne goodwin he
said i need a few things-need them
urgently and more men-white men

  his voice was low preoccupied it was
as though the brain that dictated the words
did so perfunctorily half impatiently
aloof watching strained to catch the first
hint of approach of something dreaded

  you are making progress then i
asked it was a banal question put forth
in a blind effort to claim his attention
progress he repeated progress-
he stopped abruptly rose from his
chair gazed intently toward he north i
followed his gaze far far away the moon
had broken through the clouds almost on
the horizon you could see the faint lumi-
nescence of it upon the quiet sea the dis-
tant patch of light quivered and shook
the clouds thickened again and it was
gone the ship raced southward swiftly

  throckmartin dropped into his chair he
lighted a cigarette with a hand that trem-

bled the flash of the match fell on his
face and i noted with a queer thrill of ap-
prehension that its unfamiliar expression
had deepened become curiously intensified
as though a faint acid had passed over it
etching its lines faintly deeper

  its the full moon tonight isnt it
he asked palpably with studied inconse-
quence

  the first night of full moon i an-
swered he was silent again i sat silent
too waiting for him to make up his mind
to speak he turned to me as though he
had made a sudden resolution

  goodwin he said i do need help
if ever man needed it i do goodwin-
can you imagine yourself in another world
alien unfamiliar a world of terror whose
unknown joy is its greatest terror of all
you all alone there a stranger as such a
man would need help so i need-

  he paused abruptly and arose to his feet
stiffly the cigarette dropped from his fin-
gers i saw that the moon had again broken
through the clouds and this time much
nearer not a mile away was the patch of
light that it threw upon the waves back
of it to the rim of the sea was a lane of
moonlight it was a gleaming gigantic ser-
pent racing over the rim of the world
straight and surely toward the ship

  throckmartin gazed at it as though
turned to stone he stiffened to it as a
pointer does to a hidden covey to me
from him pulsed a thrill of terror-but
terror tinged with an unfamiliar an in-
fernal joy it came to me and passed away
-leaving me trembling with its shock of
bitter sweet

  he bent forward all his soul in his eyes
the moon path swept closer closer still
it was now less than half a mile away
from it the ship fled almost it came to me
as though pursued down upon it swift
and straight a radiant torrent cleaving the
waves raced the moon stream and then-

  good god breathed throckmartin
and if ever the words were a prayer and
an invocation they were

  and then for the first time-i saw-it

  the moon path as i have said stretched
the moon pool



to the horizon and was bordered by dark-
ness it was as though the clouds above
had been parted to form a lane-drawn
aside like curtains or as the waters of the
red sea were held back to let the hosts
of israel through on each side of the
stream was the black shadow cast by the
folds of the high canopies and straight as
a road between the opaque walls gleamed
shimmered and danced the shining racing
rapids of moonlight

  far it seemed immeasurably far along
this stream of silver fire i sensed rather
than saw something coming it drew into
sight as a deeper glow within the light on
and on it sped toward us-an opalescent
mistiness that swept on with the suggestion
of some winged creature in darting flight
dimly there crept into my mind memory
of the dyak legend of the winged messen-
ger of buddha-the akla bird whose feath-
ers are woven of the moon rays whose
heart is a living opal whose wings in flight
echo the crystal clear music of the white
stars-but whose beak is of frozen flame
and shreds the souls of unbelievers still
it sped on and now there came to me
sweet insistent tinklings-like a pizzicati
on violins of glass crystalline as purest
clearest glass transformed to sound and
again the myth of the akla bird came to
me

  but now it was close to the end of the
white path close up to the barrier of dark-
ness still between the ship and the spark-
ling head of the moon stream and now
it beat up against that barrier as a bird
against the bars of its cage and i knew
that this was no mist born of sea and air
it whirled with shimmering plumes with
swirls of lacy light with spirals of living
vapor it held within it odd unfamiliar
gleams as of shifting mother-of-pearl cor-
uscations and glittering atoms drifted
through it as though it drew them from the
rays that bathed it

  nearer and nearer it came borne on the
sparkling waves and less and less grew
the protecting wall of shadow between it
and us the crystalline sounds were louder
-rhythmic as music from another planet

  now i saw that within the mistiness was
a core a nucleus of intenser light-veined
opaline effulgent intensely alive and
above it tangled in the plumes and spirals
that throbbed and whirled were seven glow-
ing lights

  through all the incessant but strangely
ordered movement of the-thing-these
lights held firm and steady they were
seven-like seven little moons one was
of a pearly pink one of delicate nacreous
blue one of lambent saffron one of the
emerald you see in the shallow waters of
tropic isles a deathly white a ghostly
amethyst and one of the silver that is seen
only when the flying fish leap beneath the
moon there they shone-these seven lit-
tle varicolored orbs within the opaline mis-
tiness of whatever it was that poised and
expectant waited to be drawn to us on the
light filled waves

  the tinkling music was louder still it
pierced the ears with a shower of tiny
lances it made the heart beat jubilantly-
and checked it dolorously it closed your
throat with a throb of rapture and gripped
it tight like the hand of infinite sorrow

  came to me now a murmuring cry still-
ing the crystal clear notes it was articulate
-but as though from something utterly
foreign to this world the ear took the
cry and translated with conscious labor into
the sounds of earth and even as it com-
passed the brain shrank from it irresistibly
and simultaneously it seemed reached to-
ward it with irresistible eagerness

  av-o-lo-ha av-o-lo-ha so the cry
seemed to throb

  the grip of throckmartins hand re-
laxed he walked stiffly toward the front
of the deck straight toward the vision now
but a few yards away from the bow i ran
toward him and gripped him-and fell
back for now his face had lost all human
semblance utter agony and utter ecstasy-
there they were side by side not resisting
each other unholy inhuman companions
blending into a look that none of gods
creatures should wear-and deep deep as
his soul a devil and a god dwelling
harmoniously side by side so must satan


famous fantastic mysteries

newly fallen still divine seeing heaven and
contemplating hell have looked

  and then-swiftly the moon path faded
the clouds swept over the sky as though
a hand had drawn them together up from
the south came a roaring squall as the
moon vanished what i had seen vanished
with it-blotted out as an image on a
magic lantern the tinkling ceased abrupt-
ly-leaving a silence like that which fol-
lows an abrupt and stupendous thunder
clap there was nothing about us but si-
lence and blackness

  through me there passed a great trem-
bling as one who had stood on the very
verge of the gulf wherein the men of the
louisades say lurks the fisher of the souls
of men and has been plucked back by
sheerest chance

  throckmartin passed an arm around me

  it is as i thought he said in his
voice was a new note of the calm certainty
that has swept aside a waiting terror of
the unknown now i know come with
me to my cabin old friend for now that
you too have seen i can tell you-he
hesitated-what it was you saw he
ended

  as we passed through the door we came
face to face with the ships first officer
throckmartin turned quickly but not soon
enough for the mate not to see and stare
with amazement his eyes turned question-
ingly to me

  with a strong effort of will throckmar-
tin composed his face into at least a sem-
blance of normality

 are we going to have much of a
storm he asked

  yes said the mate then the sea-
man getting the better of his curiosity
added profanely well probably have it
all the way to melbourne

  throckmartin straightened as though
with a new thought he gripped the of-
ficers sleeve eagerly

  you mean at least cloudy weather-
for-he hesitated-for the next three
nights say

  and for three more replied the mate

  thank god cried throckmartin and

i think i never heard such relief and hope
as was in his voice

the sailor stood amazed thank god
he repeated thank-what dye mean
but throckmartin was moving onward
to his cabin i started to follow the first
officer stopped me

  your friend he said is he ill
the sea i answered hurriedly hes
not used to it i am going to look after
him

  i saw doubt and disbelief in the sea-
mans eyes but i hurried on for i knew
now that throckmartin was ill indeed-
but that it was a sickness neither the ships
doctor nor any other could heal

chapter iii
dead all dead

throckmartin was sitting on the

side of his berth as i entered he had
taken off his coat he was leaning over
face in hands

  lock the door he said quietly not
raising his head close the port-holes and
draw the curtains-and-have you an elec-
tric flash in your pocket-a good strong
one

  he glanced at the small pocket flash i
handed him and clicked it on not big
enough im afraid he said and after
all-he hesitated-its only a theory
whats only a theory i asked in
astonishment

thinking of it as a weapon against-
what you saw he said with a wry smile

  throckmartin i cried what was it
did i really see-that thing-there in the
moon path did i really hear-

this for instance he interrupted
softly he whispered av-o-lo-ha 
with the murmur i seemed to hear again
the crystalline unearthly music an echo of
it faint sinister mocking jubilant

  throckmartin i said what was it
what are you flying from man where
is your wife-and stanton

dead he said monotonously dead
all dead then as i recoiled in horror-
the moon pool



all dead edith stanton thora-dead-
or worse and edith in the moon pool
-with them-drawn by what you saw on
the moon path-and that wants me-
and that has put its brand upon me-and
pursues me

  with a vicious movement he ripped open
his shirt

  look at this he said i gazed around
his chest an inch above his heart the skin
was white as pearl the whiteness was
sharply defined against the healthy tint of
the body he turned and i saw it ran
around his back it circled him the band
made a perfect cincture about two inches
wide

  burn it he said and offered me his
cigarette i drew back he gestured-
peremptorily i pressed the glowing end
of the cigarette into the ribbon of white
flesh he did not flinch nor was there odor
of burning nor as i drew the little cylinder
away any mark upon the whiteness

  feel it he commanded again i
placed my fingers upon the band it was
cold-like frozen marble

  he handed me a small penknife

  cut he ordered this time my
scientific interest fully aroused  did so
without reluctance the blade cut into
flesh i waited for the blood to come none
appeared i drew out the knife and thrust
it in again fully a quarter of an inch deep
i might have been cutting paper so far as
any evidence followed that what i was
piercing was human skin and muscle

  another thought came to me and i drew
back revolted

  throckmartin i whispered not
leprosy

  nothing so easy he said look again
and find the places you cut

  i looked as he bade me and in the white
ring there was not a single mark where i
had pressed the blade there was no trace
it was as though the skin had parted to
make way for the blade and closed

  throckmartin arose and drew his shirt
about him

  two things you have seen he said
it-and its mark-the seal it placed on

me that gives it i think the power to fol-
low me seeing you must believe my story
goodwin i tell you again that my wife is
dead-or worse-i do not know the prey
of-what you saw so too is stanton so
thora how- he stopped for a moment
then continued

  and i am going to melbourne for the
things to empty its den and its shrine for
dynamite to destroy it and its lair-if any-
thing made on earth will destroy it and for
white men with courage to use them per-
haps-perhaps after you have heard you
will be one of these menhe looked at me
a bit wistfully and now-do not inter-
rupt me i beg of you till i am through-
for-he smiled wanly-the mate may
be wrong and if he is-he arose and
paced twice about the room-if he is i
may not have time to tell you

  throckmartin  answered i have
no closed mind tell me-and if i can i
will help

  he took my hand and pressed it
goodwin he began if i have seemed
to take the death of my wife lightly-or
rather-bis face contorted-or rather-
if i have seemed to pass it by as something
not of first importance to me-believe me it
is not so if the rope is long enough-if
what the mate says is so-if there is cloudy
weather until the moon begins to wane-i
can conquer-that i know but if it does
not-if the dweller in the moon pool gets
me-then must you or some one avenge my
wife-and me-and stanton yet i can-
not believe that god would let a thing like
that conquer but why did he then let it
take my edith and why does he allow it
to exist are there things stronger than
god do you think goodwin

  he turned to me feverishly i hesitated
 do not know just how you define
god i said if you mean the will to

  he waved me aside impatiently
science he said what is our science
against-that or against the science of
whatever cursed vanished race that made
it-or made the way for it to enter this

famous fantastic mysteries

  with an effort he regained control of
himself

  goodwin he said do you know at
all of the ruins on the carolines the
cyclopean megolithic cities and harbors of
ponape and lele of kusaie of ruk and
hogolu and a score of other islets there
particularly do you know of the nan-
matal and metalanim

  of the metalanim i have heard and
seen photographs i said they call it
dont they the lost venice of the pacific
look at this map said throckmartin
he handed me the map that he went
on is christians map of metalanim har-
bor and the nan-matal do you see the
rectangles marked nan-tanach

  yes i said

  there he said under those walls is
the moon pool and the seven gleaming
lights that raise the dweller in the pool and
the altar and shrine of the dweller and
there in the moon pool with it lie edith
and stanton and thora

  the dweller in the moon pool i re-
peated half-incredulously

  the thing you saw said throckmar-
tin solemnly

  a solid sheet of rain swept the ports and
tbe southern queen began to roll on the
rising swells throckmartin drew another
deep breath of relief and drawing aside
a curtain peered out into the night its
blackness seemed to reassure him at any
rate when he sat again he was calm

  there are no more wonderful ruins in
the world than those of the island venice
of metalanim on the east shore of ponape
he said almost casually they take in
some fifty islets and cover with their inter-
secting canals and lagoons about twelve
square miles who built them none
knows when were they built ages be-
fore the memory of present man that is
sure ten thousand twenty thousand a
hundred thousand years ago-the last more
likely

  all these islets goodwin are squared
and their shores are frowning sea-walls of
gigantic basalt blocks hewn and put in
place by the hands of ancient man each

inner water-front is faced with a terrace of
those basalt blocks which stand out six feet
above the shallow canals that meander be-
tween them on the islets behind these
walls are cyclopean and time-shattered
fortresses palaces terraces pyramids im-
mense courtyards strewn with ruins-and
all so old that they seem to wither the
eyes of those who look on them

  there has been a great subsidence you
can stand out of metalanim harbor for
three miles and look down upon the tops
of similar monolithic structures and walls
twenty feet below you in the water

  and all about strung on their canals
are the bulwarked islets with their enig-
matic giant walls peering through the dense
growths of mangroves-dead deserted for
incalculable ages shunned by those who
live near

  you as a botanist are familiar with the
evidence that a vast shadowy continent ex-
isted in the pacific-a continent that was
not rent asunder by volcanic forces as was
that legendary one of atlantis in the
eastern ocean my work in java in
papua and in the ladrones had set my
mind upon this pacific lost land just as
the azores are believed to be the last high
peaks of atlantis so evidence came to me
steadily that ponape and lele and their
basalt bulwarked islets were the last points
of the slowly sunken western land clinging
still to the sunlight and had been the last
refuge and sacred places of the rulers of
that race which had lost their immemorial
home under the rising waters of the pacific

  i believed that under these ruins i
might find the evidence of what i sought
time and again i had encountered legends
of subterranean networks beneath the nan-
matal of passages running back into the
main island itself basalt corridors that
followed the lines of the shallow canals and
ran under them to islet after islet linking
them in mysterious chains

  my-my wife and i had talked before
we were married of making this our great
work after the honeymoon we prepared
for the expedition it was to be my monu-
ment stanton was as enthusiastic as our-
the moon pool



selves we sailed as you know last may
in fulfilment of our dreams

  at ponape we selected not without
difficulty workmen to help us-diggers i
had to make extraordinary inducements be-
fore i could get together my force their
beliefs are gloomy these ponapeans they
people their swamps their forests their
mountains and shores with malignant
spirits-ant they call them and they are
afraid-bitterly afraid of the isles of ruins
and what they think the ruins hide i do
not wonder-now for their fear has come
down to them through the ages from the
people before their fathers as they call
them who they say made these mighty
spirits their slaves and messengers

  when they were told where they were
to go and how long we expected to stay
they murmured those who at last were
tempted made what i thought then merely
a superstitious proviso that they were to be
allowed to go away on the three nights of
the full moon if only i had heeded them
and gone tool

  he stopped and again over his face the
lines etched deep

  we passed he went on into metal-
anim harbor off to our left-a mile away
arose a massive quadrangle its walls were
all of forty feet high and hundreds of feet
on each side as we passed it our natives
grew very silent watched it furtively fear-
fully i knew it for the ruins that are called
nan-tanach the place of frowning walls
and at the silence of my men  recalled
what christian had written of this place
of how he had come upon its ancient plat-
forms and tetragonal enclosures of stone-
work its wonder of tortuous alleyways and
labyrinth of shallow canals grim masses of
stonework peering out from behind verdant
screens cyclopean barricades and now
when we had turned into its ghostly shad-
ows straightway the merriment of our
guides was hushed and conversation died
down to whispers for we were close to
nan-tanach-the place of lofty walls the
most remarkable of all the metalanim
ruins he arose and stood over me

  nan-tanach goodwin he said sol-

emnly-a place where merriment is
hushed indeed and words are stifled nan-
tanach-where the moon pool lies hidden
-lies hidden behind the moon rock but
sends its diabolic soul out-even through
the prisoning stone he raised clenched
hands oh heaven he breathed grant
me that i may blast it from earth 

  he was silent for a little time

  of course i wanted to pitch our camp
there he began again quietly but i
soon gave up that idea the natives were
panic-stricken-threatened to turn back
no they said too great ant there we
go to any other place-but not there al-
though even then i felt that the secret of
the place was in nan-tanach i found it
necessary to give in the laborers were
essential to the success of the expedition
and i told myself that after a little time
had passed and i had persuaded them that
there was nothing anywhere that could
molest them we would move our tents to
it we finally picked for our base the islet
called uschen-tau-you see it here- he
pointed to the map it was close to the
isle of desire but far enough away from
it to satisfy our men there was an ex-
cellent camping-place there and a spring of
fresh water it offered besides an excel-
lent field for preliminary work before at-
tacking the larger ruins we pitched our
tents and in a couple of days the work
was in full swing

chapter iv

the mooh rock

t do not intend to tell you now
i throckmartin continued the results
of the next two weeks goodwin nor of
what we found later-if i am allowed
i will lay all that before you it is suffi-
cient to say that at the end of those two
weeks i had found confirmation of many
of my theories and we were well under way
to solve a mystery of humanitys youth-
so we thought but enough i must hurry
on to the first stirrings of the inexplicable
thing that was in store for us

  the place for all its decay and deso-


famous fantastic mysteries

lation had not infected us with any touch
of morbidity-that is not edith stanton or
myself my wife was happy-never had
she been happier stanton and she while
engrossed in the work as much as i were
of the same age and they frankly enjoyed
the companionship that only youth can
give youth i was glad-never jealous

  but thora was very unhappy she was
a swede as you know and in her blood ran
the beliefs and superstitions of the north-
land-some of them so strangely akin to
those of this far southern land beliefs of
spirits of mountain and forest and water-
werewolves and beings malign from the
first she showed a curious sensitivity to
what i suppose may be called the in-
fluences of the place she said it smelled
of ghosts and warlocks

  i laughed at her then-but now i be-
lieve that this sensitivity of what we call
primitive people is perhaps only a clearer
perception of the unknown which we who
deny the unknown have lost

  a prey to these fears thora always
followed my wife about like a shadow
carried with her always a little sharp hand-
ax and although we twitted her about the
futility of chopping fantoms with such a
weapon she would not relinquish it

  two weeks slipped by and at their end
the spokesman for our natives came to us
the next night was the full of the moon
he said he reminded me of my promise
they would go back to their village next
morning they would return after the third
night as at that time the power of the ani
would begin to wane with the moon they
left us sundry charms for our protection
and solemnly cautioned us to keep as far
away as possible from nan-tanach during
their absence-although their leader polite-
ly informed us that no doubt we were
stronger than the spirits half-exasperated
half-amused i watched them go

  no work could be done without them
of course so we decided to spend the days
of their absence junketing about the south-
ern islets of the group under the moon
the ruins were inexpressibly weird and
beautiful we marked down several spots

for subsequent exploration and on the
morning of the third day set forth along the
east face of the breakwater for our camp
on uschen-tau planning to have every-
thing in readiness for the return of our
men the next day

  we landed just before dusk tired and
ready for our cots it was only a little
after ten oclock when edith awakened me

  listen she said lean over with
your ear close to the ground  did so
and seemed to hear far far below as
though coming up from great distances a
faint chanting it gathered strength died
down ended began gathered volume
faded away into silence

   its the waves rolling on rocks some-
where i said were probably over some
ledge of rock that carries the sound

   its the first time ive heard it re-
plied my wife doubtfully we listened
again then through the dim rhythms
deep beneath us another sound came it
drifted across the lagoon that lay between
us and nan-tanach in little tinkling waves
it was music-of a sort i wont describe
the strange effect it had upon me youve
felt it-

  you mean on the deck i asked
throckmartin nodded

  i went to the flap of the tent he con-
tinued and peered out as i did so stan-
ton lifted his flap and walked out into
the moonlight looking over to the other
islet and listening i called to him

  thats the queerest sound he said
he listened again crystalline like little
notes of translucent glass like the bells
of crystal on the sistrums of isis at den-
darah temple he added half-dreamily
we gazed intently at the island suddenly
on the gigantic sea-wall moving slowly
rhythmically we saw a little group of
lights stanton laughed

  the beggars he exclaimed thats
why they wanted to get away is it dont
you see dave its some sort of a festival-
rites of some kind that they hold during
the full moon thats why they were so
eager to have us keep away too

  i felt a curious sense of relief although
the moon pool



i had not been sensible of any oppression
the explanation seemed good it explained
the tinkling music and also the chanting-
worshipers no doubt in the ruins-their
voices carried along passages i now knew
honeycombed the whole nan-matal

   lets slip over suggested stanton-
but i would not

   theyre a difficult lot as it is i said
if we break into one of their religious cere-
monies theyll probably never forgive us
lets keep out of any family party where
we havent been invited

   thats so agreed stanton

  the strange tinkling music if music it
can be called rose and fell rose and fell-
now laden with sorrow now filled with joy

   theres something-something very
unsettling about it said edith at last
soberly i wonder what they make those
sounds with they frighten me half to
death and at the same time they make
me feel as though some enormous rapture
was just around the corner

  i had noted this effect too although
i had said nothing of it and at the same
time there came to me a clear perception
that the chanting which had preceded it
had seemed to come from a vast multitude
-thousands more than the place we were
contemplating could possibly have held
of course i thought this might be due to
some acoustic property of the basalt an
amplification of sound by some gigantic
sounding-board of rock still-

   its devilish uncanny broke in stan-
ton answering my thought

  and as he spoke the flap of thoras
tent was raised and out into the moonlight
strode the old swede she was the great
norse type-tall deep-breasted molded on
the old viking lines her sixty years had
slipped from her she looked like some
ancient priestess of odin he hesitated
she knew he said slowly something
more far-seeing than my science had given
her sight she warned me-she warned me
fools and mad that we are to pass such
things by without heed he brushed a
hand over his eyes

  she stood there he went on her

eyes were wide brilliant staring she thrust
her head forward toward nan-tanach re-
garding the moving lights she listened
suddenly she raised her arms and made a
curious gesture to the moon it was-an
archaic-movement she seemed to drag it
from remote antiquity-yet in it was a
strange suggestion of power twice she re-
peated this gesture and-the tinkling died
away she turned to us

  go she said and her voice seemed
to come from far distances go from here
-and quickly go while you may they
have called- she pointed to the islet
they know you are here they wait
her eyes widened further it is there she
wailed it beckons-the-the-

  she fell at ediths feet and as she fell
over the lagoon came again the tinklings
now with a quicker note of jubilance-al-
most of triumph

  we ran to thora stanton and i and
picked her up her head rolled and her
face eyes closed turned as though drawn
full into the moonlight i felt in my heart
a throb of unfamiliar fear-for her face
had changed again stamped upon it was
a look of mingled transport and horror-
alien terrifying strangely revolting it
was-he thrust his face close to my eyes
-what you see in mine

  for a dozen heart-beats i stared at him
fascinated then he sank back again into
the half-shadow of the berth

  i managed to hide her face from
edith he went on i thought she had
suffered some sort of a nervous seizure we
carried her into her tent once within the
unholy mask dropped from her and she
was again only the kindly rugged old wo-
man i watched her throughout the night
the sounds from nan-tanach continued
until about an hour before moon-set in
the morning thora awoke none the worse
apparently she had had bad dreams she
said she could not remember what they
were-except that they had warned her of
danger she was oddly sullen and i noted
that throughout the morning her gaze re-
turned again half-fascinatedly half-won-
deringly to the neighboring isles


famous fantastic mysteries

  that afternoon the natives returned
they were so exuberant in their apparent
relief to find us well and intact that stan-
tons suspicions of them were confirmed
he slyly told their leader that from the
noise they had made on nan-tanach the
night before they must have thoroughly en-
joyed themselves

  i think i never saw such stark terror
as the ponapean manifested at the remark
stanton himself was so plainly startled that
he tried to pass it over as a jest he met
poor success the men seemed panic-
stricken and for a time i thought they
were about to abandon us-but they did
not they pitched their camp at the western
side of the island-out of sight of nan-
tanach i noticed that they built large
fires and whenever i awoke that night i
heard their voices in slow minor chant-
one of their song charms i thought
drowsily against evil ani i heard nothing
else the place of frowning walls was
wrapped in silence-no lights showed the
next morning the men were quiet a little
depressed but as the hours wore on they
regained their spirits and soon life at the
camp was going on just as it had before

  you will understand goodwin how
the occurrences i have related would excite
the scientific curiosity we rejected im-
mediately of course any explanation ad-
mitting the supernatural why not ex-
cept the curiously disquieting effects of the
tinkling music and thoras behavior there
was nothing to warrant any such fantastic
theories-even if our minds had been the
kind to harbor them

  we came to the conclusion that there
must be a passageway between ponape
and nan-tanach known to the natives-
and used by them during their rites cere-
monies were probably held in great vaults
or caverns beneath the ruins

  we decided at last that on the next
departure of our laborers we would set
forth immediately to nan-tanach we
would investigate during the day and at
evening my wife and thora would go back
to camp leaving stanton and me to spend
the night on the island observing from

some safe hiding-place what might occur

  the moon waned appeared crescent in
the west waxed slowly toward the full
before the men left us they literally prayed
us to accompany them their importuni-
ties only made us more eager to see what
it was that we were now convinced they
wanted to conceal from us at least that
was true of stanton and myself it was
not true of edith she was thoughtful ab-
stracted-reluctant thora on the other
hand showed an unusual restlessness al-
most an eagerness to go goodwin-he
paused-goodwin i know now that the
poison was working in thora-and that
women have perceptions that we men lack
-forebodings sensings i wish to heaven i
had known it then-edith he cried sud-
denly edith-come back to me for-
give me

  i stretched the decanter out to him he
drank deeply soon he had regained con-
trol of himself

  when the men were out of sight around
the turn of the harbor he went on we
took our boat and made straight for nan-
tanach soon its mighty sea-wall towered
above us we passed through the water-
gate with its gigantic hewn prisms of basalt
and landed beside a half-submerged pier
in front of us stretched a series of giant
steps leading into a vast court strewn with
fragments of fallen pillars in the center
of the court beyond the shattered pillars
rose another terrace of basalt blocks con-
cealing i knew still another enclosure

  and now goodwin for the better un-
derstanding of what follows and to guide
you should i-not be able-to accompany
you when you go there listen carefully to
my description of this place nan-tanach
is literally three rectangles the first rec-
tangle is the sea-wall built up of monoliths
gigantic steps lead up from the landing
of the sea-gate through the entrance to the
courtyard

  this courtyard is surrounded by an-
other inner basalt wall

  within the courtyard is the second en-
closure its terrace of the same basalt as
the outer walls is about twenty feet high
the moon pool



entrance is gained to it by many breaches
which time has made in its stonework this
is the inner court the heart of nan-
tanach there lies the great central vault
with which is associated the one name of
living being that has come to us out of the
mists of the past the natives say it was
the treasure-house of chau-te-leur a
mighty king who reigned long before their
fathers as chau is the ancient ponapean
word both for sun and king the name
means place of the sun king

  and opposite this place of the sun
king is the moon rock that hides the moon
pool

  it was stanton who first found what i
call the moon rock we had been inspect-
ing the inner courtyard edith and thora
were getting together our lunch i forgot
to say that we had previously gone all over
the islet and had found not a trace of living
thing i came out of the vault of chau-te-
leur to find stanton before a part of the
terrace studying it wonderingly

  what do you make of this he asked
me as i came up he pointed to the wall
i followed his finger and saw a slab of stone
about fifteen feet high and ten wide at
first all i noticed was the exquisite nicety
with which its edges joined the blocks
about it then i realized that its color was
subtly different-tinged with gray and of a
smooth peculiar-deadness

   looks more like calcite than basalt
i said i touched it and withdrew my hand
quickly for at the contact every nerve in
my arm tingled as though a shock of frozen
electricity had passed through it it was
not cold as we know cold that i felt it
was a chill force-the phrase i have used-
frozen electricity-describes it better than
anything else stanton looked at me oddly

   so you felt it too he said i was
wondering whether i was developing hal-
lucinations like thora notice by the way
that the blocks beside it are quite warm
beneath the sun

  i felt them and touched the grayish
stone again the same faint shock ran
through my hand-a tingling chill that had
in it a suggestion of substance of force

we examined the slab more closely its
edges were cut as though by an engraver of
jewels they fitted against the neighbor-
ing blocks in almost a hair-line its base
we saw was slightly curved and fitted as
closely as top and sides upon the huge
stones on which it rested and then we
noted that these stones had been hollowed
to follow the line of the gray stones foot
there was a semicircular depression run-
ning from one side of the slab to the other
it was as though the gray rock stood in the
center of a shallow cup-revealing half
covering half something about this hollow
attracted me i reached down and felt it
goodwin although the balance of the
stones that formed it like all the stones
of the courtyard were rough and age-worn
-this was as smooth as even surfaced as
though it had just left the hands of the
polisher

  its a door exclaimed stanton it
swings around in that little cup thats
what makes the hollow so smooth

   maybe youre right i replied but
how the devil can we open it

  wre went over the slab again-pressing
upon its edges thrusting against its sides
during one of those efforts i happened to
look up-and cried out for a foot above
and on each side of the corner of the gray
rocks lintel i had seen a slight convexity
visible only from the angle at which my
gaze struck it these bosses on the basalt
were circular eighteen inches in diameter
as we learned later and at the center ex-
tended two inches only beyond the face of
the terrace unless one looked directly up
at them while leaning against the moon
rock-for this slab goodwin is the moon
rock-they were invisible and none would
dare stand there

  we carried with us a small scaling-lad-
der and up this i went the bosses were
apparently nothing more than chiseled
curvatures in the stone i laid my hand
on the one i was examining and drew it
back so sharply i almost threw myself from
the ladder in my palm at the base of my
thumb i had felt the same shock that i
had in touching the slab below i put my


famous fantastic mysteries

hand back the impression came from a
spot not more than an inch wide i went
carefully over the entire convexity and six
times more the chill ran through my arm
there were goodwin seven circles an inch
wide in the curved place each of which
communicated the precise sensation i have
described the convexity on the opposite
side of the slab gave precisely the same re-
sults but no amount of touching or of
pressing these spots singly or in any com-
bination gave the slightest promise of mo-
tion to the slab itself

   and yet-theyre what open it said
stanton positively

   why do you say that i asked

   i-dont know he answered hesi-
tatingly but something tells me so
throck he went on half earnestly half
laughingly the purely scientific part of me
is fighting the purely human part of me
the scientific part is urging me to find
some way to get that slab either down or
open the human part is just as strongly
urging me to do nothing of the sort and
get away while i can

  he laughed again-shamefacedly

   which will it be he asked-and i
thought that in his tone the human side of
him was ascendant

   it will probably stay as it is-unless
we blow it to bits i said

   i thought of that he answered and-
i wouldnt dare he added soberly enough
and even as i had spoken there came to me
the same feeling that he had expressed it
was as though something passed out of the
gray rock that struck my heart as a hand
strikes an impious lip we turned away-
uneasily and faced thora coming through
a breach in the terrace

   miss edith wants you quick she be-
gan-and stopped i saw her eyes go past
me and widen she was looking at the gray
rock her body grew suddenly rigid she
took a few stiff steps forward and then ran
straight to it we saw her cast herself upon
its breast hands and face pressed against
it heard her scream as though her very
soul were being drawn from her-and
watched her fall at its foot as we picked

her up i saw steal from her face the look
i had observed when first we heard the
crystal music of nan-tanach-that un- 
human mingling of opposites

chapter v

 av-o-lo-ha

e carried thora back down to
v v where edith was waiting we told
her what had happened and what we had
found she listened gravely and as we
finished thora sighed and opened her eyes

    i would like to see the stone she said
charles you stay here with thora we
passed through the outer court silently-
and stood before the rock she touched it
drew back her hand as i had thrust it for-
ward again resolutely and held it there
she seemed to be listening then she
turned to me

    david said my wife and the wistful-
ness in her voice hurt me-david would
you be very very disappointed if we went
from here-without trying to find out any
more about it-would you

  goodwin i never wanted anything so
much in my life as i wanted to learn what
that rock concealed you will understand
-the cumulative curiosity that all the hap-
penings had caused the certainty that be-
fore me was an entrance to a place that
while known to the natives-for i still
clung to that theory-was utterly unknown
to any man of my race that within ready
for my finding was the answer to the
stupendous riddle of these islands and a
lost chapter of the history of humanity
there before me-and was i asked to turn
away leaving it unread

  nevertheless i tried to master my de-
sire and i answered-edith not a bit if
you want us to do it

  she read my struggle in my eyes she
looked at me searchingly for a moment and
then turned back toward the gray rock i
saw a shiver pass through her i felt a
tinge of remorse and pity

   edith i exclaimed well go

she looked at me hard science is a
jealous mistress she quoted no after
the moon pool



all it may be just fancy at any rate you
cant run away no but dave im going
to stay too

  you are not i exclaimed youre
going back to the camp with thora stan-
ton and i will be all right

   im going to stay she repeated and
there was no changing her decision as we
neared the others she laid a hand on my
arm

   dave she said if there should be
something - well - inexplicable tonight-
something that seems-too dangerous-will
you promise to go back to our own islet
tomorrow or while we can and wait until
the natives return

  i promised eagerly-for the desire to
stay and see what came with the night was
like a fire within me

 and would to heaven i had not
waited another moment goodwin would
to heaven i had gathered them all to-
gether then and sailed back on the instant
through the mangroves to uschen-tau

  we found thora on her feet again and
singularly composed she claimed to have
no more recollection of what had happened
after she had spoken to stanton and to me
in front of the gray rock than she had after
the seizure on uschen-tau she grew sullen
under our questioning precisely as she had
before but to my astonishment when she
heard of our arrangements for the night
she betrayed a febrile excitement that had
in it something of exultance

  we had picked a place about five hun-
dred feet away from the steps leading into
the outer court

  we settled down just before dusk to
wait for whatever might come i was near-
est the giant steps next me edith then
thora and last stanton each of us had
with us automatic pistols and all except
thora had rifles

  night fell after a time the eastern
sky began to lighten and we knew that the
moon was rising grew lighter still and the
orb peeped over the sea swam suddenly
into full sight edith gripped my hand
for as though the full emergence into the
heavens had been a signal we heard begin

beneath us the deep chanting it came
from illimitable depths

  the moon poured her rays down upon
us and i saw stanton start on the in-
stant i caught the sound that had roused
him it came from the inner enclosure it
was like a long soft sighing it was not
human seemed in some way-mechanical
i glanced at edith and then at thora my
wile was intently listening thora sat as
she had since we had placed ourselves el-
bows on knees her hands covering her face

  and then suddenly from the moonlight
flooding us there came to me a great drow-
siness sleep seemed to drip from the rays
and fall upon my eyes closing them--clos-
ing them inexorably i felt ediths hand
relax in mine and under my own heavy
lids saw her nodding i saw stantons head
fall upon his breast and his body sway
drunkenly i tried to rise-to fight against
the profound desire for slumber that
pressed in on me

  and as i fought i saw thora raise her
head as though listening saw her rise and
turn her face toward the gateway for a
moment she gazed and my drugged eyes
seemed to perceive within it a deeper
stronger radiance thora looked at us
there was infinite despair in her face-and
expectancy i tried again to rise-and a
surge of sleep rushed over me dimly as
i sank within it i heard a crystalline chim-
ing raised my lids once more with a su-
preme effort saw thora bathed in light
standing at the top of the stairs and then
-sleep took me for its very own-swept
me into the very heart of oblivion

  dawn was breaking when i wakened
recollection rushed back on me and i
thrust a panic-stricken hand out toward
edith touched her and felt my heart give
a great leap of thankfulness she stirred
sat up rubbing dazed eyes i glanced to-
ward stanton he lay on his side back
toward us head in arms

 edith looked at me laughingly
heavens what sleep she said mem-
ory came to her her face paled what
happened she whispered what made
us sleep like that she looked over to


famous fantastic mysteries

stanton sprang to her feet ran to him
shook him he turned over with a mighty
yawn and i saw relief lighten her face as
it had lightened my heart

  stanton raised himself stiffly he
looked at us whats the matter he ex-
claimed you look as though youve seen
ghosts

  edith caught my hands wheres
thora she cried before i could answer
she ran out into the open calling thora
thora

  stanton stared at me taken was
all i could say together we went to my
wife now standing beside the great stone
steps looking up fearfully at the gateway
into the terraces there i told them what
i had seen before sleep had drowned me
and together then we ran up the stairs
through the court and up to the gray rock

  the gray rock was closed as it had
been the day before nor was there trace of
its having opened no trace even as i
thought this edith dropped to her knees
before it and reached toward something
lying at its foot it was a little piece of
gray silk i knew it for part of the kerchief
thora wore about her hair edith took the
fragment hesitated i saw then that it
had been cut from the kerchief as though
by a razor-edge i saw too that a few
threads ran from it-down toward the base
of the slab ran to the base of the gray
rock and-under it the gray rock was a
door and it had opened and thora had
passed through it

  i think goodwin that for the next
few minutes we all were a little insane
we beat upon that diabolic entrance with
our hands with stones and clubs at last
reason came back to us stanton set forth
for the camp to bring back blasting powder
and tools while he was gone edith and i
searched the whole islet for any other clue
we found not a trace of thora nor any
indication of any living being save our-
selves we went back to the gateway to
find stanton returned

  goodwin during the next two hours
we tried every way in our power to force
entrance through the slab the rock within

effective blasting radius of the cursed door
resisted our drills we tried explosions at
the base of the slab with charges covered
by rock they made not the slightest im-
pression on the surface beneath expending
their force of course upon the slighter
resistance of their coverings

  afternoon found us hopeless so far as
breaking through the rock was concerned
night was coming on and before it came
we would have to decide our course of
action i wanted to go to ponape for help
but edith objected that this would take
hours and after we had reached there it
would be impossible to persuade our men
to return with us that night if at all what
then was left clearly only one of two
choices to go back to our camp and wait
for our men to return and on their return
try to persuade them to go with us to nan-
tanach but this would mean the aban-
donment of thora for at least two days
we could not do it it would have been too
cowardly

  the other choice was to wait where we
were for night to come to wait for the
rock to open as it had the night before and
to make a sortie through it for thora be-
fore it could close again with the sun had
come confidence at least a shattering of
the mephitic mists of superstition with
which the strangeness of the things that
had befallen us had clouded for a time our
minds in that brilliant light there seemed
no place for fantoms

  the evidence that the slab had opened
was unmistakable but might not thora
simply have found it open through some
mechanism still working after ages and
dependent for its action upon laws of
physics unknown to us upon the full light
of the moon the assertion of the natives
that the ani had greatest power at this
time might be a far-flung reflection of
knowledge which had found ways to use
forces contained in moonlight as we have
found ways to utilize the forces in the suns
rays if so thora was probably behind the
slab sending out prayers to us for help

  but how explain the sleep that had
descended upon us might it not have
the moon pool



been some emanation from plants or gase-
ous emanations from the island itself such
things were far from uncommon we agreed
in some way the period of their greatest
activity might coincide with the period of
the moon but if this were so why had not
thora also slept

  as dusk fell we looked over our
weapons edith was an excellent shot with
both rifle and pistol with the idea that
the impulse toward sleep was the result
either of emanations such as i have de-
scribed or man made we constructed
rough-and-ready but effective neutralizes
which we placed over our mouths and
nostrils we had decided that my wife was
to remain in the hollow spot stanton
would take up a station on the far side of
the stairway and i would place myself
opposite him on the side near edith the
place i picked out was less than five hun-
dred feet from her and i could reassure
myself now as to her safety as i looked
down upon the hollow wherein she
crouched as the phenomena had previ-
ously synchronized with the rising of the
moon we had no reason to think they
would occur any earlier this night

  a faint glow in the sky heralded the
moon i kissed edith and stanton and i
took our places the moon dawn increased
rapidly the disk swam up and in a mo-
ment it seemed was shining in full radiance
upon ruins and sea

  as it rose there came as on the night
before the curious little sighing sound from
the inner terrace i saw stanton straighten
up and stare intently through the gateway
rifle ready even at the distance he was
from me i discerned amazement in his
eyes the moonlight within the gateway
thickened grew stronger i watched his
amazement grow into sheer wonder

  i arose

   stanton what do you see i called
cautiously he waved a silencing hand i
turned my head to look at edith a shock
ran through me she lay upon her side her
face was turned full toward the moon
she was in deepest sleep

  as i turned again to call to stanton

my eyes swept the head of the steps and
stopped fascinated for the moonlight
had thickened more it seemed to be-
curdled-there and through it ran little
gleams and veins of shimmering white fire
a languor passed through me it was not
the ineffable drowsiness of the preceding
night it was a sapping of all will to move
i tore my eyes away and forced them upon
stanton i tried to call out to him i had
not the will to make my lips move i had
struggled against this paralysis and as i
did so i felt through me a sharp shock it
was like a blow and with it came utter
inability to make a single motion good-
win i could not even move my eyes

  i saw stanton leap upon the steps and
move toward the gateway as he did so
the light in the courtyard grew dazzlingly
brilliant through it rained tiny tinklings
that set the heart to racing with pure joy
and stilled it with terror

  and now for the first time i heard that
cry av-o-lo-ha av-o-lo-ha the cry you
heard on deck it murmured with the
strange effect of a sound only partly in our
own space-as though it were part of a
fuller phrase passing through from another
dimension and losing much as it came in-
finitely caressing infinitely cruel

  on stantons face i saw come the look
i dreaded-and yet knew would appear
that mingled expression of delight and fear
the two lay side by side as they had on
thora but were intensified he walked
on up the stairs disappeared beyond the
range of my fixed gaze again i heard the
murmur-av-o-lo-hat there was triumph
in it now and triumph in the storm of
tinklings that swept over it

  for another heart-beat there was si-
lence then a louder burst of sound and
ringing through it stantons voice from the
courtyard-a great cry-a scream-filled
with ecstasy insupportable and horror un-
irriaginable and again there was silence
i strove to burst the invisible bonds that
held me i could not even my eyelids
were fixed within them my eyes dry and
aching burned

  then goodwin-i first saw the inex-


famous fantastic mysteries

plicable the crystalline music swelled
where i sat i could take in the gateway
and its basalt portals rough and broken
rising to the top of the wall forty feet
above shattered ruined portals-unclimb-
able from this gateway an intenser light
began to flow it grew it gushed and into
it into my sight walked stanton

  stanton but-goodwin what a vi-
sion he ceased i waited-waited

chapter vi

into the moon pool

oodwin throckmartin said at
last i can describe him only as a
thing of living light he radiated light
was filled with light overflowed with it
around him was a shining cloud that
whirled through and around him in radiant
swirls shimmering tentacles luminescent
coruscating spirals

  i saw his face it shone with a rapture
too great to be borne by living men and
was shadowed with insuperable misery it
was as though his face had been remolded
by the hand of god and the hand of satan
working together and in harmony you
have seen it on my face but you have
never seen it in the degree than stanton
bore it the eyes were wide open and
fixed as though upon some inward vision
of hell and heaven j he walked like the
corpse of a man damned who carried
within him an angel of light

  the music swelled again i heard
again the murmuring- av-o-lo-hal stan-
ton turned facing the ragged side of the
portal and then i saw that the light that
filled and surrounded him had a nucleus
a core-something shiftingly human shaped
-that dissolved and changed gathered
itself whirled through and beyond him and
back again and as this shining nucleus
passed through him stantons whole body
pulsed with light as the luminescence
moved there moved with it still and serene
always seven tiny globes of light like seven
little moons

  so much i saw and then swiftly stan-

ton seemed to be lifted-levitated-up the
unscalable wall and to its top the glow
faded from the moonlight the tingling mu-
sic grew fainter i tried again to move
the spell still held me fast the tears
were running down now from my rigid lids
and brought relief to my tortured eyes

  i have said my gaze was fixed it was
but from the side peripherally it took
in a part of the far wall of the outer enclo-
sure ages seemed to pass and i saw a
radiance stealing along it soon there came
into sight the figure that was stanton far
away he was-on the gigantic wall but
still i could see the shining spirals whirling
jubilantly around and through him felt
rather than saw his tranced face beneath
the seven lights a swirl of crystal notes
and he had passed and all the time as
though from some opened well of light the
courtyard gleamed and sent out silver fires
that dimmed the moon-rays yet seemed
strangely to be a part of them

  ten times he passed before me so
the luminescence came with the music
swam for a while along the man-made cliff
of basalt and passed away between times
eternities rolled and still i crouched there
a helpless thing of stone with eyes that
would not close

  at last the moon neared the horizon
there came a louder burst of sound the
second and last cry of stanton like an
echo of the first again the soft sigh from
the inner terrace then-utter silence
the light faded the moon was setting and
with a rush life and power to move re-
turned to me i made a leap for the steps
rushed up them through the gateway and
straight to the gray rock it was closed-
as i knew it would be but did i dream
it or did i hear echoing through it as
though from vast distances a triumphant
shouting-av-o-lo-hai a v-o-lo-ha

  i remembered edith i ran back to her
at my touch she wakened looked at me
wonderingly raised herself on a hand

  dave she said i slept-after all
she saw the despair on my face and
leaped to her feet dave she cried what
is it wheres charles
the moon pool



  i lighted a fire before i spoke then
i told her and for the balance of that
night we sat before the flames arms around
each other-like two frightened children

  suddenly throckmartin held his hands
out to me appealingly

  goodwin old friend i he cried dont
look at me as though i were mad its
truth absolute truth wait- i com-
forted him as well as i could after a
little time he took up his story

  never he said did man welcome
the sun as we did that morning as soon
as it was light we went back to the court-
yard the basalt walls whereon i had seen
stanton were black and silent the ter-
races were as they had been the gray
slab was in its place in the shallow hollow
at its base was-nothing nothing-noth-
ing was there anywhere on the islet of
stanton-not a trace not a sign on nan-
tanach to show that he had ever lived

  what were we to do precisely the
same arguments that had kept us there the
night before held good now-and doubly
good we could not abandon these two
could not go as long as there was the faint-
est hope of finding them-and yet for love
of each other how could we remain i
loved my wife goodwin-how much i
never knew until that day and she loved
me as deeply

   it takes only one each night she
said beloved let it take me

  i wept goodwin we both wept

   we will meet it together she said
and it was thus at last that we arranged
it

  that took great courage indeed
throckmartin i interrupted he looked
at me eagerly

  you do believe then he ex-claimed

  i believe i said he pressed my hand
with a grip that nearly crushed it

  now he told me i do not fear if
i-fail you will prepare and carry on the
work

  i promised and-heaven forgive me-
that was three years ago

  it did take courage he went on again
quietly more than courage for we

knew it was renunciation each of us in
our hearts felt that one of us would not be
there to see the sun rise and each of us
prayed that the death if death it was
would not come first to the other

  we talked it all over carefully bring-
ing to bear all our power of analysis and
habit of calm scientific thought we con-
sidered minutely the time element in the
phenomena although the deep chanting
began at the very moment of moonrise
fully five minutes had passed between its
full lifting and the strange sighing sound
from the inner terrace i went back in
memory over the happenings of the night
before at least fifteen minutes had inter-
vened between the first heralding sigh and
the intensification of the moonlight in the
courtyard and this glow grew for at least
ten minutes more before the first burst of
the crystal notes

  the sighing sound-of what had it re-
minded me of course-of a door revolv-
ing and swishing softly along its base

  edith i cried i think i have it
the gray rock opens five minutes after
upon the moonrise but whoever or what-
ever it is that comes through it must wait
until the moon has risen higher or else
it must come from a distance the thing
to do is not to wait for it but to surprise
it before it passes out the door we will go
into the inner court early you will take
your rifle and pistol and hide yourself
where you can command the opening-if
the slab does open the instant it moves
i will enter its our best chance edith
i think its our only one

  my wife demurred strongly she
wanted to go with me but i convinced
her that it was better for her to stand
guard without prepared to help me if i
were forced from what lay behind the
rock again into the open

  the day passed too swiftly in the
face of what we feared our love seemed
stronger than ever was it the flare of the
spark before extinguishment i wondered
we prepared and ate a good dinner we
tried to keep our minds from anything but
the scientific aspect of the phenomena


famous fantastic mysteries

we agreed that whatever it was its cause
must be human and that we must keep
that fact in mind every second but what
kind of men could create such prodigies
we thrilled at the thought of finding per-
haps the remnants of a vanished race liv-
ing perhaps in cities over whose rocky skies
the pacific rolled exercising there the lost
wisdom of the half-gods of earths youth

  at the half-hour before moonrise we
two went into the inner courtyard  took
my place at the side of the gray rock edith
crouched behind a broken pillar twenty
feet away slipped her rifle-barrel over it
so that it would cover the opening

  the minutes crept by the courtyard
was very quiet the darkness lessened and
through the breaches of the terrace i
watched the far sky softly lighten with
the first pale flush the stillness became
intensified it deepened-became unbear-
ably- -expectant the moon rose showed
the quarter the half then swam up into
full sight like a great bubble

  its rays fell upon the wall before me
and suddenly upon the convexities i have
described seven little circles of light sprang
out they gleamed glimmered grew
brighter-shone the gigantic slab before
me turned as though on a pivot sighing
softly as it moved

  for a moment i gasped in amazement
it was like a conjurers trick and the
moving slab i noticed was also glowing
becoming opalescent like the little shining
circles above

  only for a second i gazed and then
with a word to edith flung myself through
the opening which the slab had uncovered
before me was a platform and from the
platform steps led downward into a smooth
corridor this passage was not dark it
glowed with the same faint silvery radiance
as the door down it i raced as i ran
plainer than ever before i heard the chant-
ing the passage turned abruptlv passed
parallel to the walls of the outer courtyard
and hen once more led abruptly down-
ward still i ran and as  ran i looked
at the watch on my wrist less than three
minutes had elapsed

  the passage ended before me was a
high vaulted arch for a moment i paused
it seemed to open into space a space filled
with lambent coruscating many-colored
mist whose brightness grew even as i
watched i passed through the arch and
stopped in sheer awe

  in front of me was a pool it was
circular perhaps twenty feet wide around
it ran a low softly curved lip of glimmering
silvery stone its water was palest blue
the pool with its silvery rim was like a
great blue eye staring upward

  upon it streamed seven shafts of radi-
ance they poured down upon the blue
eye like cylindrical torrents they were like
shining pillars of light rising from a sap-
phire floor

  one was the tender pink of the pearl
one of the auroras green a third a deathly
white the fourth the blue in mother-of-
pearl a shimmering column of pale amber
a beam of amethyst a shaft of molten
silver such are the colors of the seven
lights that stream upon the moon pool i
drew closer awestricken the shafts did
not illumine the depths they played upon
the surface and seemed there to diffuse to
melt into it the pool drank them

  through the water tiny gleams of
phosphorescence began to dart sparkles
and coruscations of pale incandescence
and far far below i sensed a movement a
shifting glow as of something slowly rising

  i looked upward following the radiant
pillars to their source far above were
seven shining globes and it was from these
that the rays poured even as i watched
their brightness grew they were like
seven moons set high in some caverned
heaven slowly their splendor increased
and with it the splendor of the seven beams
streaming from them it came to me that
they were crystals of some unknown kind
set in the roof of the moon pools vault
and that their light was drawn from the
moon shining high above them they were
wonderful those lights-and what must
have been the knowledge of those who set
them there

  brighter and brighter they grew as the
the moon pool



moon climbed higher sending its full radi-
ance down through them i tore my gaze
away and stared at the pool it had grown
milky opalescent the rays gushing into
it seemed to be filling it it was alive with
sparklings scintillations glimmerings and
the luminescence i had seen rising from its
depths was larger nearer

  a swirl of mist floated up from its sur-
face it drifted within the embrace of the
rosy beam and hung there for a moment
the beam seemed to embrace it sending
through it little shining corpuscles tiny
rosy spiralings the mist absorbed the rays
was strengthened by it gained substance
another swirl sprang into the amber shaft
clung and fed there moved swiftly toward
the first and mingled with it and now
other swirls arose here and there too fast
to be counted hung poised in the embrace
of the light streams flashed and pulsed
into each other

  thicker and thicker still they arose
until the surface of the pool was a pulsat-
ing pillar of opalescent mist steadily grow-
ing stronger drawing within it life from
the seven beams falling upon it drawing
to it from below the darting red atoms
of the pool into its center was passing the
luminescence i had sensed rising from the
far depths and the center glowed
throbbed-began to send out questing
swirls and tendrils

  there forming before me was that
which had walked with stanton which had
taken thora-the thing i had come to
find

  with the shock or realization my brain
sprang into action my hand fell to my
pistol and i fired shot after shot into its
radiance the place rang with the explo-
sions and there came to me a sense of un-
forgivable profanation devilish as i knew
it to be that chamber of the moon pool
seemed also-in some way-holy as
though a god and a demon dwelt there
inextricably commingled

  as i shot the pillar wavered the water
grew more disturbed the mist swayed and
shook gathered itself again i slipped a
second clip into the automatic and another

idea coming to me took careful aim at one
of the globes in the roof from thence i
knew came the force that shaped the
dweller in the pool from the pouring rays
came its strength if i could destroy them
i could check its forming i fired again and
again if i hit the globes i did no damage
the little motes in their beams danced with
the motes in the mist troubled that was
all

  up from the pool like little bells like
bubbles of crystal notes rose the tinklings
their notes were higher had lost their
sweetness were angry as it were with
themselves

  and then out from the inexplicable
hovering over the pool swept a shining
swirl it caught me above the heart
wrapped itself around me i felt an icy
coldness and then there rushed over me a
mingled ecstasy and horror every atom of
me quivered with delight and at the same
time shrank with despair there was noth-
ing loathsome in it but it was as though
the icy soul of evil and the fiery soul of
good had stepped together within me the
pistol dropped from my hand

  so i stood while the pool gleamed and
sparkled the streams of light grew more
intense and the mist glowed and strength-
ened i saw that its shining core had shape
-but a shape that my eyes and brain
could not define it was as though a being
of another sphere should assume what it
might of human semblance but was not
able to conceal that what human eyes saw
was but a part of it it was neither man
nor woman it was unearthly and androgy-
nous even as i found its human semblance
it changed and still the mingled rapture
and terror held me only in a little corner
of my brain dwelt something untouched
something that held itself apart and
watched was it the soul i have never
believed-and yet-

  over the head of the misty body there
sprang suddenly out seven little lights
each was the color of the beam beneath
which it rested i knew now that the
dweller was-complete

  and then-behind me i heard a scream


famous fantastic mysteries

it was ediths voice it came to me that
she had heard the shots and followed me
i felt every faculty concentrate into a
mighty effort i wrenched myself free from
the gripping tentacle and it swept back i
turned to catch edith and as i did so
slipped-fell as i dropped i saw the ra-
diant shape above the pool leap swiftly
for me

  there was the rush past me and as the
dweller paused straight into it raced edith
arms outstretched to shield me from it

  he trembled

  she threw herself squarely within its
diabolic splendor he whispered she
stopped and reeled as though she had en-
countered solidity and as she faltered it
wrapped its shining self around her the
crystal tinklings burst forth jubilantly
the light filled her ran through and
around her as it had with stanton and 
saw drop upon her face-the look from
the pillar came the murmur-av-o-lo-ha
the vault echoed it

  edith i cried edith i was in
agony she must have heard me even
through the-thing i saw her try to free
herself her rush had taken her to the
very verge of the moon pool she tottered
and in an instant-she fell-with the radi-
ance still holding her still swirling and
winding around and through her-into the
moon pool she sank goodwin and with
her went-the dweller

  i dragged myself to the brink far
down i saw a shining many-colored nebu-
lous cloud descending caught a glimpse of
ediths face disappearing her eyes stared
up to me filled with supernal ecstasy and
horror and-vanished

  i looked about me stupidly the seven
globes still poured their radiance upon the
pool it was pale-blue again its spark-
lings and coruscations were gone from
far below there came a muffled outburst of
triumphant chanting

  edith i cried again edith come
back to me and then a darkness fell upon
me i remember running back through the
shimmering corridors and out into the
courtyard reason had left me when it

returned i was far out at sea in our boat
wholly estranged from civilization a day
later i was picked up by the schooner in
which i came to port moresby

  i have formed a plan you must hear
it goodwin- he fell upon his berth i
bent over him exhaustion and the relief
of telling his story had been too much for
him he slept like the dead

chapter vii

the dweller comes

all that night i watched over him
when dawn broke i went to my
room to get a little sleep myself but my
slumber was haunted

  the next day the storm was unabated
throckmartin came to me at lunch he
looked better his strange expression had
waned he had regained much of his old
alertness

  come to my cabin he said there he
stripped his shirt from him something
is happening he said the mark is
smaller it was as he said

  im escaping he whispered jubilantly
just let me get to melbourne safely and
then well see wholl win for goodwin
im not at all sure that edith is dead-
as we know death-nor that the others are
there was something outside experience
there-some great mystery

  and all that day he talked to me of his
plans

  theres a natural explanation of
course he said my theory is that the
moon rock is of some composition sensitive
to the action of moon rays somewhat as
the metal selenium is to sun rays there is
a powerful quality in moonlight as both
science and legends can attest we know
of its effect upon the mentality the nerv-
ous system even upon certain diseases

  the moon slab is of some material that
reacts to moonlight the circles over the
top are without doubt its operating
agency when the light strikes them they
release the mechanism that opens the slab
just as you can open doors with sunlight
by an ingenious arrangement of selenium-
the moon pool



cells apparently it takes the strength of
the full moon to do this we will first try
a concentration of the rays of the nearly
full moon upon these circles to see whether
that will open the rock if it does we will
be able to investigate the pool without in-
terruption from-from-what emanates

  look here on the chart are their loca-
tions i have made this in duplicate for
you in the event of something happening
to me

  he worked upon the chart a little more

  here he said is where i believe the
seven great globes to be they are prob-
ably hidden somewhere in the ruins of the
islet called tau where they can catch the
first moon rays i have calculated that
when i entered i went so far this way-
here is the turn so far this way took this
other turn and ran down this long curving
corridor to the hall of the moon pool that
ought to make lights at least approxi-
mately here he pointed

  they are certainly cleverly concealed
but they must be open to the air to get the
light they should not be too hard to find
they must be found he hesitated again
i suppose it would be safer to destroy
them for it is clearly through them that
the phenomena of the pool is manifested
and yet to destroy so wonderful a thing
perhaps the better way would be to have
some men up by them and if it were neces-
sary to protect those below to destroy
them on signal or they might simply be
covered that would neutralize them to
destroy them- he hesitated again no
the phenomena is too important to be de-
stroyed without fullest investigation his
face clouded again but it is not human
it cant be he muttered he turned to me
and laughed the old conflict between
science and too frail human credulity he
said

  again-we need half a dozen diving-
suits the pool must be entered and
searched to its depths that will indeed
take courage yet in the time of the new
moon it should be safe or perhaps better
after the dweller is destroyed or made
safe

  we went over plans accepted them re-
jected them and still the storm raged-
and all that day and all that night

  i hurry to the end that afternoon there
came a steady lightening of the clouds
which throckmartin watched with deep
uneasiness toward dusk they broke away
suddenly and soon the sky was clear the
stars came twinkling out

  it will be tonight throckmartin said
to me goodwin friend stand by me
to-night it will come and i must fight

  i could say nothing about an hour be-
fore moonrise we went to his cabin we
fastened the port-holes tightly and turned
on the lights throckmartin had some
queer theory that the electric rays would
be a bar to his pursuer i dont know why
a little later he complained of increasing
sleepiness

  but its just weariness he said not
at all like that other drowsiness its an
hour till moonrise still he yawned at
last wake me up a good fifteen minutes
before

  he lay upon the berth i sat thinking
i came to myself with a start what time
was it i looked at my watch and jumped
to the port-hole it was full moonlight
the orb had been up for fully half an
hour i strode over to throckmartin and
shook him by the shoulder

  up quick man i cried he rose
sleepily his shirt fell open at the neck
and i looked in amazement at the white
band around his chest even under the
electric light it shone softly as though little
flecks of light were in it

  throckmartin seemed only half-awake
he looked down at his breast saw the
glowing cincture and smiled

  oh yes he said drowsily its com-
ing-to take me back to edith well im
glad

  throckmartin i cried wake up
fight

  fight he said no use keep the
maps come after us

  he went to the port and drowsily drew
aside the curtain the moon traced a broad
path of light straight to the ship under


famous fantastic mysteries

its rays the band around his chest gleamed
brighter and brighter shot forth little
rays seemed to move

  he peered out intently and suddenly
before i could stop him threw open the
port i saw a glimmering presence moving
swiftly along the moon path toward us
skimming over the waters

  and with it raced little crystal tinklings
and far off i heard a long-drawn murmur-
ing cry

  on the instant the lights went out in the
cabin evidently throughout the ship for i
heard shoutings above i sprang back into
a corner and crouched there at the port-
hole was a radiance swirls and spirals of
living white cold fire it poured into the
cabin and it was filled with dancing motes
of light and over the radiant core of it
shone seven little lights like tiny moons it
gathered throckmartin to it light pulsed
through and from him i saw his skin turn
to a translucent shimmering whiteness like
illumined porcelain his face became un-
recognizable inhuman with the monstrous
twin expressions so he stood for a mo-
ment the pillar of light seemed to hesi-
tate and the seven lights to contemplate
me i shrank further down into the corner
i saw throckmartin drawn to the port
the room filled with murmuring i fainted

  when i awakened the lights were burn-
ing again

  but of throckmartin there was no trace i

  there are some things that we are
bound to regret all our lives i suppose i
was unbalanced by what i had seen i
could not think clearly but there came to
me the sheer impossibility of telling the
ships officers what i had seen wftai
throckmartin had told me they would
accuse me i felt of his murder at neither
appearance of the phenomena had any save
our two selves witnessed it i was certain of
this because they would surely have dis-
cussed it why none had seen it i do not
know

  the next morning when throckmartins
absence was noted i merely said that i
had left him early in the evening it
occurred to no one to doubt me or to
question me further his strangeness had
caused much comment all had thought
him half-mad and so it was officially re-
ported that he had fallen or jumped from
the ship during the failure of the lights the
cause of which was another mystery of that
night

  afterward the same inhibition held me
back from making his and my story known
to my fellow scientists

  but this inhibition is suddenly dead and
i am not sure that its death is not a
summons from throckmartin

  and now i am going to nan-tanach to
make amends for my cowardice by seeking
out the dweller so sure am i that all i
have written here is absolutely true

space station no 

in its time space station no  was
unique in the solar system and prob-
ably the universe for of all the worlds
that swung around the sun it alone was a
creation of mortal engineers and me-
chanics built of materials artificially pre-
pared shaped and joined for civilized pur-
poses and profit

  without it the martio-terrestrial

leagues jovian colonies might well have
failed at the start jupiters moons abound-
ed in valuable minerals offered broad lands
for development and settlement by emi-
grants but they were almost too far away
only once in two years were mars and
jupiter in conjunction close enough for
liners and freighters to ply between a
few days thus then the planets drifted




famous fantastic mysteries

apart on their orbits the gap widening
to an impossible distance for two years
more

  wherefore the leagues experts planned
and built space station no  to circle
the sun along mars orbit but on the far
side of the sun from mars old sols
gravity carried the synthetic planetoid in
approximate position as the current of a
whirlpool carries a chip of wood in an
endless circle occasional rocket blasts kept
the station exactly where it should be
thus when the planet was in opposi-
tion and at its farthest from jupiter the
station was at its closest a half-way house
for the refueling of jupiter-bound ships
from earth and mars supplies and other
relief could reach the colonists once each
year instead of once each two years

  viewed from afar against the star-dusted
black of space the station looked like
an exaggerated mimicry of ringed saturn
the spherical center was an outmoded and
awkward space-hulk two hundred meters in
diameter construction ships had towed it
into position then clamped great girders
all around its equator to extend like spokes
from a hub these in turn were braced
with smaller crosswise girders and cables
and the whole decked over with metal
plates to make a circular plane a mile
across extending collar-like from and
around the ball-shaped center this deck
was the landing port the hulk in the
middle did duty as administration build-
ing storehouse and living quarters

  for men lived there and though the
league and the colonies found space sta-
tion no  practical and valuable its at-
tendants found it all but unendurable

  there were two of them standing just
now on the outer rim of the deck clad
in space-overalls of insulated fabric mag-
netized boots that held them to the almost
gravityless plating and bell-like glass hel-
mets slightly clouded against the suns
unimpeded glare the taller was lane
everitt a tough-bodied young terrestrial
who was glaring as fiercely as the sun it-
self he had had enough of space station
no  this cramped comer where he must

live in dingy cabins corridors and holds
and swaddle himself in glass and fabric
whenever he ventured out for exercise

  a full year of this prison-like boredom
and why because he a simple navigator
of spaceways inc had loved and been
loved by fortuna sidney daughter of the
corporations director-general now he was
out here doomed to the most deadly rou-
tine job in the universe while sbe was
shut up in the strictest schools with in-
structions to forget him

  rats he growled aloud and his own
voice echoing inside the helmet startled
him he must stop mumbling to himself-
yes and lying awake and cheating at soli-
taire-or hed go crazy like that chap
ropakihn he had relieved out here and
if he went crazy he too would be clapped
in an asylum no job no freedom no
fortuna he gazed down from the decks
verge into the endlessness of space found
no comfort there then turned his head
inside the transparent helmet to glance
back along the level expanse of deck he
felt like a very small fly on the rim of
a very big tray with the hulk for an
apple in its center and earth and the
solar system valued him at less than a

fly-

  did you mention rats ev you require
rodents for some purpose

it was the mechanically expressionless
voice of zeoui his martian associate
who stood beside him zeouis chrysanthe-
mum-like face-if face it really was-tilted
toward him questioningly

  zeoui was one of those martians destined
from birth and before to live and work with
terrestrials eugenic breeding and medical
alteration had brought his shape to ap-
proximate that of an earth man his soft
bladder-like body had been elongated
stiffened with artificial spine and raised
erect upon two slender limbs its upper
corners were even shaped into shoulders
and bore in lieu of arms two tentacles
with sensitive tips just now concealed in
his space-mittens at the top under the
helmet was his large and fragile braincase
space station no 



shaggy all over with the petal-like fronds
and tags of tissue housing his martian
awareness of conditions that approximated
the five terrestrial senses thus developed
and equipped zeoui could walk and work
with earths mankind could talk-he
favored ultra-pedantic and exact poly-
syllables-by stirring air through an arti-
ficial larynx he was more at home among
terrestrials than among the jelly-like
bodies and feeler-appendages of his fellow-
martians

  he spoke again a rocket vessel swift
and small approaches

 coming here already everitt
glanced up they arent due not for
hours yet

  the thought of ships depressed him
for five days they would be passing him
heading for jupiter and in a few weeks
the craft from the colonies would be stop-
ping off on the inner trail-worse than no
company at all he and zeoui would mix
liquid oxygen and other ingredients into
fuel and operate the pumps but there
would be no chatting or fraternizing skip-
pers might transmit formal orders receive
reports no more no word from home
or friends no mail   

  observe it is approaching rapidly
zeoui pointed a tentacle in the blackness
far above circled a tiny gray dart of a
space-craft cutting speed and preparing
to land everitt scowled in perplexity lift-
ing a hand to his helmet as if to rumple
his bright hair inside

  thats not a spaceways job he said
in mystified tones it looks like a war
craft what-

  the lead-colored cigar burst into a
dazzling flare at the nose and the gush
of the forward rockets braked it sharply
as the two watchers stood at gaze it fell
to a swaying crawl directly overhead then
it curved in around and down to the deck
not a hundred yards away

  almost before its rocket blasts had sub-
sided a panel sprang open in its side and
a helmeted head popped out

 someone disembarks commented
zeouis maddeningly dry voice yes and

makes significant motions of the hand
the first figure to reach the deck was
small and slight even in space-overall

  ev came a soft trembling cry to
everitts earphones and his heart stirred
he had never expected to hear that voice
again

  ev dear the little figure was run-
ning toward him and he found his own
voice

  fortuna he cried back and sped to
meet her a moment later he had clutched
the newcomer in his arms was pressing her
close to him and gazing at a dear white
face through two thicknesses of clouded
glass her big storm-dark eyes swam with
tears of mingled joy and concern her full
lips trembled

  then more motion from the direction of
the ship caught everitts eye a towering
form in full space-armor stepped into view
then another then four more in a group
they bore arms in their hands or belts-
the big leader an electro-automatic rifle
his stunted neighbor a lantern-like rust-
ray the other pistols everitt stiffened in
startled wonder

  its all right theyre my men came
fortunas voice to his ears lets go some-
where and talk ev its important
right fortuna he agreed making
his voice steady to zeoui he spoke
crisply stay on deck will you im tak-
ing her inside

  zeouis face-petals stirred and curled
against his helmet-glass as if in worried
fidgets these individuals he ventured
is it to be understood that-

  steady old man cautioned everitt
quickly you arent supposed to speak
to visitors

  the same restriction applies to your-
self reminded zeoui

  but i must speak everitt said flatly
ill handle this situation alone though
no need for you to be involved

it wras half a warning half a snub
and zeoui fell silent taking fortunas
arm everitt led her toward the hulk their
eyes were ever upon each other and their


famous fantastic mysteries

emotion was too deep for smiles behind
them came the armed half dozen compan-
ions of the girl

  the lock-panel in the hulk slid back
at everitts touch and first he and fortuna
then the others stepped into the little air-
lock chamber a moment later they had
passed the inner panel inside the old con-
trol room that stripped of instruments and
fitted with a desk chairs and cabinets
served as an office they felt the comforting
pull of the artificial gravity that the outer
deck lacked

  all began to unship their helmets
everitt and fortuna freed their faces first
and at once kissed with hungry violence
everitt thought that the biggest of for-
tunas companions chuckled derisively
under his half-doffed headpiece but was
too happy to resent it

  and now fortuna murmured freeing
her lips ill tell you how we are work-
ing your escape

  escape repeated everitt sharply
you dont mean-

  i tried to get you relieved the girl
said with a serious wag of her dark curly
head but daddy turned obdurate said
hed keep you here until you rotted and
so in desperation i went at it another
way half turning in everitts embrace
she nodded to the big man tell him
ropakihn

  ropakihn said everitt are you-
he paused

  the giants head was out of the helmet
now it showed huge heavy-jowled with
bright piggy eyes a mighty blade of a
nose and a crimson complexion the
coarse well-combed thatch of hair was
a good six feet six above the office floor
and the armored body was heavy even for
that height a loose smile crossed the big
red countenance as a raspy voice answered
everitts half-voiced question

  yes im ropakihn the man who
played-well eccentric-to get away from
here the lips grew looser writhing a bit
they shut me up in a comfortable but
boresome asylum until miss fortuna here
came to visit me she arranged for a leave

of absence for me and these other inmates
you see and his rasp grew smug i knew
about the new type of war-craft and their
ms-ray knew it from a retired officer-
also eccentric enough to be shut up he
babbled out the location of a hangar where
an ultra-fast experimental ship was kept

  everitt puzzled over this information
ms-ray-metal-solvent i heard it was
being developed an advance on the rust-
ray principle

  since you were exiled it became a
reality ropakihn informed him theres
one on that super-speed ship out there-
the one we took a few nights ago from its
hangar

  he paused grinning in a self-congratu-
latory manner while fortuna took up the
tale i guessed she said that ropakihn
wasnt as afflicted as they thought i also
guessed that he would be miffed enough
at the people who had exiled and im-
prisoned him to be an ally he was good
enough to listen and to pick these other
friends

  for the first time everitt looked at
ropakihns five companions also helmet-
less by now and he was genuinely

shocked

  not one of them was normal the man
with the rust-ray was a hunched and
twisted dwarf with the face of a cunning
weasel two of the others were well set
up but they wore expressions of brutal stu-
pidity the remaining two were patently
imbecilic fidgety and grimacing no won-
der both fortuna and ropakihn had avoid-
ed saying crazy-had employed such
words as eccentric and afflicted the
other expression would have been too
pointed to use in this company

  ropakihn continued amusedly

  in any case everitt miss fortuna got
us out now she wants us to try to get you
out

  exactly added fortuna in happy
triumph what with our extra speed we
have a start of hours on the rest of the
ships have you any baggage well head
back to earth at once

  i cant go said everitt
space station no i



there was silence for a moment and
they all looked at him-fortuna un-
comprehending ropakihn somewhat scorn-
ful the others foolishly querulous then
fortuna began to argue

  you dont understand darling it isnt
as though they were out patrolling the
space-lanes for you why they wont even
know youve deserted until were safely
landed and lost in africa or brazil or-
i cant go said everitt again
ropakihn chuckled as he had when for-
tuna and everitt had kissed each other

  do i read you rightly he inquired
with the hint of a sneer do you feel
that your duty lies here

  duty snapped fortuna heatedly
this routine job why ev darling a
child could do it mixing fuel and filling
tanks

  without me the jovian route will be
broken in two he reminded her zeoui
couldnt handle things alone

  fortuna clenched her little fists in de-
spair dont you want me dont i love
you and didnt spaceways do you a
shabby trick your every instinct-
there are many instincts he inter-
rupted gently one is for love and heaven
knows that its strong in me but anothers
for honor and loyalty that keeps me at
my post

  another silence with all eyes on everitt
finally fortuna shrugged though not in
complete resignation

  maybe youre right she said slowly
i know i am everitt rejoined you
can go home dear and wait for the thing
to work out properly

  that growled ropakihn in a new
grim voice is where you are wrong

he took a step forward the five
grouped behind him suddenly
brought their weapons to the ready ropa-
kihn himself shifted his right hand to the
trigger-switch of his rifle

  corby he said crisply to the twisted
man with the rust-ray go out on deck
and bring that martian in here

  yop the man called corby made a

sloppy gesture of salute and turned to enter
the air-lock putting on his helmet as he
did so

  everitt tightened his muscles as if to
spring but ropakihn lifted his weapon
warningly steady said the giant
youre my prisoners

  ropakihn called fortuna im giv-
ing orders here

  not now the heavy red face crinkled
in a broader grin you think ill go back
to that asylum think again lady were
going to go to jupiter instead

  everitt had not shrunk back from the
menace of the guns youre outlaws
then he demanded accusingly you
mean to defy earth and mars together
outlaws-for today agreed ropakihn
in high good humor but in a few weeks
well be conquerors that ms-ray will blow
the defenses loose from the whole jovian
colonial setup theyll have to surrender
to us instead of outlaws-rulers he
grew exutlant and earth and mars will
have to treat with us

  then he grew blustery get ready to
mix us some fuel everitt enough for the
jump to jupiter

  everitt shook his head i serve no ship
without a voucher from the interplanetary
commerce commission he said flatly

  heres my voucher and ropakihn
twiddled his rifle its electric powered
but bored for lead-and-powder cartridges
-fifty-just like the guns of the ancients
a novelty piece his grin grew cruel no
merciful death by shock everitt how
would you like me to start shooting your
toes off one at a time

  everitt was disdainfully silent

  or miss fortunas toes perhaps does
that intrigue you

  everitt felt a chill creep along his spine
fortuna tortured i   

  theres no fuel mixed as yet he an-
nounced we didnt expect a ship so
soon

  no then well start the machinery
going and when weve fueled ourselves
well try out our ms-ray-wash this sta-
tion clear out of the universe


famous fantastic mysteries

  one or two of ropakihns followers
giggled inanely at the thought and for-
tuna shivered the sense of her danger and
his own helplessness infuriated everitt
youll destroy the station he cried

  of course ropakihns face turned
harsh it doesnt fill me with affectionate
memories and with it gone police craft
cant refuel and follow

  next year mars will be in the halfway
station spot everitt reminded him
therell be plenty of trouble flying out
to jupiter after you

  when were holding all the colonies as
hostage laughed ropakihn dont be
absurd theyll be glad to meet whatever
terms we make freedom money recogni-
tion as governors even

  everitt said nothing the scheme was
as practicable as it was daring such a
weapon as the ms-ray unknown as yet on
the jovian moons would spell victory for
this handful of insane adventurers what
fantastic rulers for the unlucky settlers

  the air-lock opened and two figures en-
tered-zeoui and corby taking off their
helmets the martians chrysanthemum
face turned toward ropakihn

  your lieutenant has been explaining
to me your stratagem for the invasion and
conquest of jupiters satellites he volun-
teered in his precise manner have you
accommodations in your ship for a re-
cruit

  everitt gasped was zeoui the pedant
inflamed by dreams of piracy ropakihn
grinned welcome

  certainly we have room for several re-
cruits but how about the fuel you mar-
tian-whats your name

  zeoui was the reply you want
fuel expediently give me two men to
help

  ropakihn waved forward the two brutal-
faced outlaws zeoui led them through the
inner door of the office and down the pas-
sage toward the fuel-mixing chamber ever-
itt watched with rage-darkened face much
to ropakihns amusement

  your partner seems to be reasonable
he commented how about you two

  everitt shook his head you want some-
body normal to leaven your crazy crew
he exulted at the flinch that the word
crazy wrung from his captors and went
on nothing doing ropakihn if youre
destroying the space station destroy me
with it you wont have long to enjoy
the sensation

  ropakihn turned toward fortuna but
she shook her head its unnecessary to
ask me she said

  the big man chuckled his gaze feast-
ing on her trim lines which the collapsed
space-overall could not disguise im not
asking he replied youre coming
along-to help shorten the journey  
his greedy eyes never left her youll be
queen of my new jovian empire  

everitt could stand no more he
made a lunge at his towering foe
but the magnetism in his shoes augmented
by the floors artificial gravity slowed his
charge for a second in that second ropa-
kihn was on guard fending him off with
the rifle barrel across his chest while
corby and the two others had fallen upon
him

  for full half a minute everitt battled
his angry strength almost a match for his
three assailants but then they forced him
down and began to bind his limbs with a
belt from his own overall fortuna seeing
his defeat made a dash as if to help him
ropakihn laughing clutched at her and
she swerved away then ran for the door
that led to the hulks interior

 a form popped into view on the
threshold barring her retreat it was
zeoui a quick clutch with a tentacle-tip
and he had her by the wrist was she
endeavoring to depart he enunciated
dryly

  she tried to fight growled ropakihn
ill take the fight out of her before weve
been aboard a quarter of an hour hows
the fuel job

  going expeditiously retorted the mar-
tian the assistants you placed at my
disposal are supervising the mixing-pumps
may i be assigned others to aid in extend-
space station no 



ing the feed conduits to your vessel
right ropakihn turned his eyes to
his three remaining henchmen corby
stay here to keep an eye on everitt you
others on with your helmets and go with
zeoui

  zeoui still held fortuna who had
quieted but still glared angrily it would
be well he suggested to confine this
person likewise

  he himself assisted in tying her arms
and ankles then he bustled about help-
ing his two new companions to put on their
helmets finally he led them out upon the
deck

time passed everitt and fortuna
helpless in their bonds lay propped
against a bulkhead under corbys guard
ropakihn lolling on the desk talked he
throve on his own boasting telling enthusi-
astically of his enterprise in planning the
theft of the speed-craft with its new ray
equipment his courage and resource in exe-
cuting that theft of his daring in conceiv-
ing the idea of conquering jupiters moons

  half an hour was gone before he wearied
at the sound of his voice breaking his
stream of self-praise then he moved to a
port and looked out

  wheres zeoui he demanded half
aloud i dont see him or the others they
must be in the cruiser itself

  again he studied the deck outside
theyve got the pipe drawn out to the
ship he continued after a moment but
its limp-there cant be a very big stream
of fuel probably none at all

  swinging around he glared at the
prisoners and at corby say he blus-
tered at the universe in general are those
lazy limpets soldiering on their mixing
jobs ill show them how he started to
tramp across the floor but the loud clang
of his magnetized boots halted him lift-
ing one foot then the other he pulled the
metal footgear away no need for them to
know im coming he commented corby
youre in charge until i get back

  he was gone into the inner passage
corby his slow mind groping after the

reason for his chiefs ire took a step as
if to follow then stared stupidly in ropa-
kihns wake for the moment he was not
watching everitt or fortuna

  everitt felt a tug at his bonds a hand
was freeing him-fortunas hand she had
won loose he wasted no time in ponder-
ing now but as his own arms felt the
strap draw away sprang to his feet

  corby heard the motion and turned but
before he lifted his ray-tube everitts hard
fist connected with the loose-hung jaw the
hunchback went hurtling backward his
skull ringing on the floor before his wea-
pon fell with a shattering sound he lay
still

  everitt caught up the ray-tube saw that
it was jammed and dropped it with an ex-
clamation of impatience from the desk
he seized his helmet

  what are you going to do he asked
fortuna breathlessly sitting up to untie
her ankles

  stay where you are he cautioned her
hastily leave your feet tied and your
hands behind you then ropakihn and his
men will think youre still helpless and
leave you alone for a minute he poised
the helmet above his head im making
a dash for the ship outside zeoui and
his playmates may not recognize me at
once if i get in among them and smash
them ill have the ms-ray give me a
moment to learn how to work it and itll
be our saving

  clamping his helmet in place he
stepped to the inner lock-panel behind
him rose the panicky roar of ropakihn
hurrying back from his inspection the bel-
lowed words penetrated even the helmet-
glass

  corby the giant was shouting look
alive the fuel-mixer went wrong somehow
-liquid oxygen escaped and both the boys
are frozen stiff as boards

  he came into view and saw everitt

  you loose he bawled but his erstwhile
captive was into the air-lock then through
it and upon the deck

  no motion no life met everitts eyes
outside the outlaw ship was where it had


famous fantastic mysteries

been half the radius of the deck away and
to it extended the jointed metal pipe that
carried fuel

  ropakihn was right no liquid was cours-
ing through that flaccid conduit everitt
started at a half-run for the cruiser

  but a savage voice rang in his ear-
phones stand still or ill plug you
everitt whirled around ropakihn had
come out helmet hastily donned and rifle
poised his huge body almost fell at the
outer threshold of the lock and only a
clutch at a port-rim saved it

  the outlaw in his haste to pursue had
left off his magnetic boots outside the hulk
he had only the tiny gravity-pull of the
deck to govern him and his huge body
weighed but a few ounces an unconsid-
ered touch of toe-pressure was enough to
unbalance him even hurl him clear of the
deck

  take off your shoes and throw them to
me he yelled at everitt

  the smaller man stood still making no
motion to obey

  ropakihns beaked face darkened with
rage off with them or-

  steadying himself with his left hand on
the port-rim ropakihn pointed his rifle
with the other everitt ducked out of the
line of fire himself slipping to one knee
at once ropakihn floundered forward anc
upon him clutching one foot and fairly
ripping the shoe from it ill do the walk-
ing you do the stumbling he taunted

  everitt lay still beneath the outlaw but
not in submission he was analyzing the
situation-so logical though he had never
thought of it before inside the hulk you
had weight and never stopped to realize
that out here you needed magnets to hold
you down lest-

  ropakihn had tucked his rifle under an
elbow and was pulling off the other shoe
that vast mass of flesh sprawling upon
everitt was no heavier than a silk hand-
kerchief even as the second shoe fell to
the deck everitt summoned his strength
and surged upward thrusting his enemy
along and traveling with him next instant
they floundered in emptiness the deck

dropping from beneath them as if snatched
by the hand of a prank-playing titan

rthey wrestled wildly in space weight-
a less as swimmers and clumsy as
dreamers it was like a dream at that a
horrible nightmare in which one strikes or
grapples but encounters no resistance
arms around ropakihns body everitt
stared over the crag of the giants shoulder
at space station no -dwindling falling
down and away shrinking to a lump-cen-
tered shield on a starry curtain of black
the very heave of everitts body had been
enough to send them both flying like stones
from a sling unfettered by gravity unim-
peded by air hundreds of yards a mile

  they wrenched and tore at each others
throats for a time baffled by the folds of
fabric then ropakihn letting go struck
everitt clumsily on the breast-bone the
buffet dashed them violently apart

  everitt saw the jetty sky and its stars
whirl saw the disk that was the station
whip from underfoot to overhead then
back out of sight to appear underfoot
again he was somersaulting in space
ropakihn too was flying backward head
over heels over head shrinking to the ap-
parent size of a squirming doll

  everitt gave vent to a hysterical laugh
over their ridiculous plight strong as lions
but light as feathers they were losing
themselves in nothingness by their own un-
directible exertions even now they had no
power to come together or to return to the
deck after they had left he had a mental
picture of himself falling to an orbit
circling the man-made planetoid like a
satellite ropakihn caught in another
orbit might make the same circuit at a
slower or faster pace drawing into con-
junction perhaps they would be close
enough to resume hostilities

  everitt laughed again more wildly

  a shout assailed his earphones ropa-
kihn far away was doing something with
the rifle yes firing it not at everitt but
into space behind himself flash after flash
of detonation and ropakihn seemed to
grow in size
space station no 



  oh that was it the weapon carried
explosive charges and its recoil though
barely enough to stir a proper weight
could propel the few ounces that its
operator scaled just now the rocket was
definitely approaching he grew bigger
bigger like a rubber figure swelling with
gas

  now he was aiming the gun at everitt
firing once the bullet missed and the re-
coil slowed ropakihn again they collided
and grappled

  the smaller more agile everitt man-
aged to seize and clamp his enemys mas-
sive rifle arm ropakihn tried to shove him
loose but everitt wrung the wrist he held
with desperate vigor he heard the giants
involuntary grunt of pain saw the huge
mittened hand sag open the weapon swam
slowly out of it

  darting out his own hand everitt
clutched the receding barrel he had no
time to find trigger or grip but struck as
with a club

  the shock of the blow falling on ropa-
kihns shoulder almost drove them apart
again but they clung somehow as the giant
tried to snatch back his rifle everitt threw
his legs up and forward clamping them
around his foes great waist as around
a wild horse he took a rib-buckling
punch over the heart but next moment had
struck once more with the rifle-butt this
time full on the front of ropakihns helmet

  the clouded glass splintered and sud-
denly the outlaws red visage showed plain
and monstrous in the unfiltered sunlight
a breaths space then the red turned blue
the great mouth gaped after the fleeting
air bulging eyes fixed everitt with dire
hate and abruptly fell blank and dull as
pebbles the blueness deserted the face in
turn and went tallow-pale the heaving
cask-like body between everitts clamping
knees gave a final convulsive shudder and
relaxed

  everitt had won

he did not feel elated only weary
kicking loose from the senseless
dying ropakihn he stared frantically

around to locate the station it was behind
his shoulder pointing the rifle into space
before him he fired it again and again the
recoil made itself felt again and again he
fired

  a full minute elapsed before he ap-
proached the deck of the little island in
space his sense of direction changed-the
station was no longer before or behind
but beneath he glanced upward once afar
he saw the silhouette of ropakihn quite
motionless and limp in the sky then he
drifted down like a leaf from a tree an
overalled figure dashed across the deck-
plates to meet him

  an outstanding exhibition of valor and
physical prowess ev

  no mistaking that affected voice it was
the traitor zeoui did he think to mock
and sneer everitt clutched his rifle to
fire but the martian stood still beneath
him holding up something a weapon
everitts magnetic shoes

  zeoui was trying to help him then
puzzled unable to comprehend the mar-
tians sudden change of front still ever-
itt held his fire as he floated slowly down

  a moment later the terrestrial had
landed and zeoui was steadying him with
a careful tentacle

  once more assume your metal foot-
gear came the dry accents of advice as
i have already observed it was a splendid
and satisfactory encounter not lacking in
scientific interest i dared hope that when
i left miss for tunas encircling cords some-
what loose she would find opportunity to
set you at liberty

  everitt was beginning to realize the
other outlaws- he began

  they have been dealt with decisively
zeoui reassured him i profited by the
patent stupidity of the first contingent in
the mixing-shop catching them off guard
i released upon them a flood of liquid
oxygen the sudden drop in temperature
accomplished their demise

  the others who accompanied me out
here suffocated for want of air i affect-
ing to assist them in donning their helmets
fastened only half the clamps the air

gradually but completely departed

  and corby asked everitt the man
i knocked out

  the charming and capable young object
of your admiration miss fortuna sidney
has locked him up

once more in the office together
zeoui everitt and fortuna seated
themselves around the desk from the
ventilator of the locker-closet where the
madman corby was imprisoned came the
occasional grumpy pleas for freedom

  and in that manner the martian fin-
ished his story i found it extremely
simple so simple in truth that ropakihn
who considered himself the only astute
person in the situation was disposed to
trust me my pretense at helping to cap-
ture miss fortuna clinched it thereafter
he thought nothing of counter-treachery
on my part but allowed me to conduct
his unfortunate lunatic associates to their
destruction

  everitt made a rueful grimace you
had me fooled too he confessed humbly

  again corby pleaded from his prison
who shut me up here what happened
he seems dazed by evs blow ex-
plained fortuna claims not to remem-
ber coming here or anything about ropa-
kihns attempt

  zeoui nodded sagely such mental de-
rangements frequently follow head in-
juries he said weightily perhaps he is
only feigning amnesia to obtain mercy in
that case however he would not dare

amend my report to the police ship
police ship gasped everitt is one
coming

  i took opportunity to broadcast an
emergency message with the radio in the
war-craft immediately thereafter i was in
receipt of a reply from a patrol ship at
the request of director-general sidney
himself-he was aboard-i told the story
he must have been furious at me
cried fortuna

  let me amend my statement went on
zeoui i told only a portion of the story
i led them to believe that the theft and
flight were ropakihns idea exclusively
and that the outlaws kidnaped miss for-
tuna from her school on earth the direc-
tor-general expressed great satisfaction in
your activities ev and intimated that he
would release you from exile he will also
cease his objections to your marriage-
zeoui you flower-faced sap exploded
everitt youve given me all the credit
again zeoui nodded gravely

  but what about you fortuna de-
manded

  yes youre screwier than ropakihns
whole mob put together everitt chimed
in if you take no credit theyll keep
you on duty here

  the martian nodded

  that is eminently correct both ever
itt and fortuna could have sworn that the
petals of zeouis weird visage were
wreathed into something like a grin of
satisfaction to be sure i shall remain
on duty here i enjoy it

by tod robbins

if you are a militant materialist with no belief in anything but that which
you see with your eyes or touch with your own hands this story is not for
you but there are more strange things hidden away in the sea than ever

man heard tell of

chapter i

the box on the beach

r heres things out there miss
bessie that you never heard tell
of i know youre school-learned
and all but the old seas got more secrets
hid away than there are shells on this
beach

  elizabeth wilkinson smiled down on the
garrulous old fisherman who sat cross-
icgged on the sand patiently mending the
broken strands of a net he had been in
her fathers employ since she could first re-
member and had always had that quality
so endearing to the very young of being
able to lie prodigiously and convincingly
even now she enjoyed his wild tales the
savor of the sea was in them while lis-
tening to them she felt very childlike and
very frightened it was just as though she
were swept off her feet and carried away
in a heavy surf

  now own up captain ben she said
attempting to make his watery blue eyes
drop before her steady brown ones you
just thought of that on the spur of the
moment there never was such a creature
as a whimpus

 the old mans
under-lip shot out
as it always did
when his word was
doubted he as-
sumed a grieved
and disgusted ex-
pression his thick
blunt fingers once
more busied them-
selves with their
task

  whats the use of tellin you anythin
miss bessie he mumbled youre get-
tin to be just like your pop with no belief
in nothin but what you sees with your own
eyes if all folks was like you there
wouldnt be no religion even it aint what
we see what makes life interestin its
whats just around the corner theres
things happenin right now that aint never
been writ up in books and theres creatures
crawlin about what would make ringling
brothers head animal-trainer take to his
heels if he ever suddenly happened to catch
sight of em

  but a whimpus captain ben you say
it has a tail and fins like a fish

  it has so miss bessie and big blue
eyes most like a gals leastwise so dick
jamieson told me-him who was wrecked
in the china sea and dick was a truthful
man when not in liquor

how long are they captain ben
about the length of my arm missy
with pointed teeth which can give a man
a cruel bite if they catched him in the
calf of the leg

  and hair captain ben i believe you
said they had long curly hair

 so dick told
me missy with a
flash to it like gold
in the sunlight he
leaned down and
put his hand on one
of em thinkin he
had found a treasure
or somethin it was
nothin more or less
than a whimpus
sleepin her hair
slung over her like


famous fantastic mysteries

a net and she wakes up fightin-mad and
bites a piece off his little finger for his
boldness then she gives a flip to her tail
and away she sails as saucy as you please
-leavin dick on the bank jumpin with
pain

  for a long moment there was silence
the girl had half turned away from the
old fisherman and was looking out to sea
it was a day in late august above the
gray tumbling waste of waters a pale opal-
escent curtain of fog was slowly descend-
ing the adventurer-mr wilkinsons
yacht-rode at anchor barely two hundred
yards from shore already she was swathed
in drifting tides of vapor like a fantom
ship she appeared and disappeared at one
moment she seemed to be scarcely a stones
throw from the beach at the next a mile
or so offshore it had been blowing hard
on the preceding night the waves were
like an army coming home with victory on
their shields they thundered out their
deep-throated war song on the beach far
out in the impenetrable mist like a voice
from another world the melancholy call
of a seagull rose for a moment above the
tumult of tumbling waters

  no miss bessie captain ben con-
tinued with a shake of his head theres
more things hid away in the sea than ever
man heard tell of but the fogs gettin
precious thick i think youd best be off to
the house or youll get wet to the skin

  but elizabeth had caught sight of some-
thing in the surf which held her undivided
attention it was a large box which at
that moment was riding the snowy crest of
a wave on it came smoothly like a minia-
ture ship sinking at last into a milky chasm
as the billow tripped on the beach with
its treasure and fell sprawling for an in-
stant the box was left high and dry

  moved by a sudden impulse which she
was soon to regret elizabeth ran forward
across the wet quivering sand and bent
over the box

  come back missy  captain ben called
in a shrill quavering voice what ever are
ye thinkin of come back this instant
afore one of them big waves catches yer 

  elizabeth raised the box holding it tight
to her breast she hurried back just as
another huge wave charged down on her
with a threatening roar lowering her prize
to the sand beyond the reach of its many
long arms she surveyed captain ben tri-
umphantly

  this belongs to me now doesnt it
she asked indicating the box with a slender
moist finger

  aye aye missy captain ben said
solemnly what a man fishes out of the
sea belongs to him no matter who it be-
longed to afore the king of englands
crown jewels might be in this here box
and they wouldnt be no more his now than
mike raffertys pig he paused and
scratched his grizzled chin but i guess
these aint crown jewels he added rather
sorrowfully theyre more like to be
lemons

   why lemons

  cause a tramp steamer run aground
in the fog last night off wishbone point
they had to lighten her cargo afore they
got her off and they do say she was loaded
down with crates of lemons some of the
boys in the village was fishin for em all
mornin

  i dont believe it is a crate of lemons
elizabeth said with a shake of her head
once more she bent down and turned the
box over on its side at the next moment
with a stifled cry she stepped back so hu-
riedly that she nearly tripped over the old
mans outstretched legs

  why whats the matter missy cap-
tain ben asked looking up from the net in
surprise you looks as if somethin had
bit yer

  theres something alive in that box
she said in a rather unsteady voice i
heard it move do you suppose it could
be a baby captain ben

  the old fishermans mouth extended
from ear to ear a glimpse of his gums
could be seen with here and there a single
discolored tooth rising from them like so
many weatherbeaten tombstones he was
laughing silently

  dont laugh at me elizabeth cried
the whimpus



 angrily i tell you there is something
 alive in that box i heard it rattling about
 when i moved it

   captain ben rose stiffly to his feet and
 bent over the box i misdoubt its a baby
 miss bessie he mumbled a baby
 wouldnt have much chance of weatherin
 through such a sea in this old craft mebbe
 the lemons aint packed very tight lets
  see

   he put one of his gnarled hands on the
 box and turned it over on the instant a
 strange flapping sound could be heard issu-
 ing from the interior followed almost im-
 mediately by a loud scratching as though
 long sharp nails were at work

   captain ben uttered an ejaculation of
 amazement thats mighty strange he
 muttered there must be fish and crabs
 in this box but who ever heard tell of-
 he paused and scratched the top of his
 weatherbeaten hat shall i open it

    no elizabeth murmured i dont
 want to see whats in it theres something
 horrible i know i wish i hadnt taken
 that box out of the water

   why whats the matter missy you
 look all upset its only fish and crabs
 thrown in higgledy-piggedly in an old chest
 it aint like you to get worked up over
 nothin

   elizabeth bit her lip what made her
 feel this way about a harmless old box
 it was ridiculous and yet try as she
 would she could not even look at it now
 when she had bent over it and put her
 hand on its cold wet surface when she had
 heard those strange flapping and scratch-
 ing sounds within a wave of intense if
 unaccountable fear and repulsion had
 passed through her now trembling little
 patches of gooseflesh stood out on her
 brown arms this was absurd she must
 have caught cold or perhaps she just had
 a touch of malaria

   i think ill go back to the house cap-
 tain ben she said at last i feel cold
 you dont look very hearty today
 missy and thats a fact youd better
 change yer shoes and stockins i reckon
 but what will i do with the box

  bring it up to the house captain ben
you can leave it on the back stoop

  aye aye missy ill tote it up in a
wheelbarrow mebbe theres some likely
sized fish in this here chest they seem
lively enough and a good crab aint to
be sneezed at neither if its cooked
proper

chapter ii
a claimant for tiie chest

r wilkinson greeted his daugh-
ter as she mounted the veranda he
was a stout middle-aged man with a
sallow complexion dull prominent eyes
and a predilection for a quiet uneventful
life the one excitement which he allowed
himself was an occasional flyer in wall
street he was proverbially lucky in such
speculations the considerable fortune
which his father had left him had never
taken wings-on the contrary like a snow-
ball rolling down-hill it had gathered to it-
self many lesser fortunes but this success
without effort had given him no flicker of
joy

  each year his complexion had grown
sallower his eyes duller his muscles flab-
bier the boredom which must necessarily
attend a smooth existence was smothering
the manhood in the financier beneath a
mountain of down he was snoring his life
away

  now he rose ponderously and laid a
plump moist hand on his daughters shoul-
der ive got a surprise for you bessie
he said in a slow heavy voice

  a surprise dad what is it

  mr wilkinson smiled sleepily he had
intended teasing her but now lacked the
vitality the surprise is upstairs shav-
ing he said sinking back into the easy-
chair like a large stuffed doll

  elizabeth flushed in an instant she for-
got all about the wooden box and her dread
of its flapping scratching contents you
dont mean that the surprise is jay dad
do you

  mr wilkinson nodded and smiled
yes he murmured dropped into my


famous fantastic mysteries

office just after he got off the boat didnt
wire-wanted to make it a surprise but
here he is to tell you about it himself

  at this moment a tall athletic young
man opened the screened door and seeing
elizabeth hurried forward and took her in
a bearlike hug jay had never been a gen-
tle lover but she liked him all the better
for that

  well old girl he said at last holding
her off at arms length and regarding her
attentively with his steady gray eyes
youre looking pretty fit you didnt ex-
pect me home so soon eh

  no i didnt she murmured you
wrote me that you intended doing europe
with the rest of the team

  he smiled a trifle shamefacedly i in-
tended to he said i thought that youd
think all the more of me if i stayed away
a little longer after we beat the english-
men that deciding game the team broke up
larry and martin dropped in on paris
henry and i were going to do scotland and
ireland but at the last moment i quit i
had to do some explaining henry was as
sore as a boil he paused and stroked the
cleft in his prominent chin meditatively
well here i am he finished and will-
ing to step up to the altar most any time
wait till somebody asks you sir she
said with a sudden flash of color do
you still think that polo is the most impor-
tant thing in life

  the young man shook his head no
but its exciting and i crave excitement
elizabeth experienced the disquieting
sensation at her fiances words which is
common enough to most girls when they are
brought face to face with their great enemy
-that priestess of adventure which beckons
the swift and the strong it is the instinct
of feminine love to be everything and it
must content itself with so little

  after a nomen t she said a trifle bitterly
at one moment jay you talk of settling
down of becoming thoroughly domesti-
cated at the next you sigh for speed and
thrills which side of you am i to believe
i like excitement but i dont put it above
everything else in the world

  youre a girl her fiance answered
calmly and with a girl its different but
a fellow has to be doing strenuous things
or else- he paused and shrugged

  haskin pardon lady and gentlemen
said a strange husky voice which sounded
like the scraping together of two rusty iron
bars a chap down at the beach says as
ow you ad picked up a old chest

  all three turned their heads in surprise
there standing on the lower step of the
veranda swinging a mildewed canvas cap
between finger and thumb was one of the
strangest figures elizabeth had ever seen

  above medium height but so bent that
his back rounded out like a drawn bow his
long legs wide apart as though balancing
himself against the shock of the sea his
head with its great bulbous nose and close-
set black eyes cocked on one side shrewdly
like a bird about to take flight-he resem-
bled some scarecrow posturing in a corn-
field and yet on the second glance one
felt the humanness of the man it was in
his crafty thin-lipped mouth in the swing
of his lantern jaws in the twitching of his
corded brown fists which resembled two
sea-spiders all in all from his tangle of
straw-colored hair to his shining boots he
looked as out of place on mr wilkinsons
broad sun-swept veranda as one of the pi-
rates in treasure island

  the chap as i spoke to the man con-
tinued said as ow e ad brought the chest
up ere a few minutes back now could 
once lay my eyes on it lady and gentle-
men id know it fast enough by some
oles i drilled in its side

  i think he must mean the box i picked
out of the surf elizabeth said turning
toward her father there was some holes
in that i remember

  was there lady was there cried the
man in evident excitement the lord
love yer lady thats news to warm a
poor sailors soul now did these oles
form a kind of a eart lady-a eart like
yer see on this ere arm of mine

  he rolled up his sleeve disclosing a sun-
burnt arm on which was tattooed in gay
coloring a three-masted schooner two lov-
the whimpus



ers sitting under a dark blue tree a queen
of spades and lastly a mermaid reclining
on a cliff and pulling up hand over hand
a large scarlet heart on which was inscribed
in minute lettering caught again sep-
tember  

  youre well decorated my man said
mr wilkinson with a flicker of an eyelash
in jays direction who was the artist
its a tasty bit of work aint it said
the sailor in evident pleasure thats
what i halways says-tasty black tom
did em hall-im who was my shipmate
aboard the sea king lord e was a hart-
ist-born was tom liked nothin better
than to get a poor chap in front of im like
a bloody blackboard to draw purty pictures
on e did this ere when we was ship-
wrecked together on a coral island in the
china seas e never got off that island
neither did black tom

  never got off it elizabeth cried
did he die there

  now i wouldnt say so much as that
gal leastwise i aint e went off and
left me sudden one mornin and e never
showed up no more they catched im i
guess

  who caught him jay broke in

  the sailor half-closed his eyes till they
were mere pin-points they he mut-
tered them things what live on coral
islands in the china seas

  he means whim pus said captain ben
who had at that moment hobbled up

  right you are matey said the man
the whimpus got black tom soul and
body e was uncommon fond of gals was
tom

  at this point mr wilkinson rose im-
patiently to his feet now what can we
do for you he said rather sharply if
youve come up here to tell us lies about
mermaids youre wasting your time weve
got a first-class liar here as it is he gave
captain ben a significant stare

  theres more things afloat mr wilkin-
son than you ever heard tell of captain
ben began in a plaintive asthmatic whine
this man here is right when he speaks
of whimpus i heard tell of em afore

  but the sailor cut him short look
here lady and gentlemen he said step-
ping forward i come peaceful enough for
my property and im bound ill ave it
my daughter picked the box out of the
water well according to law it now be-
longs to her if you want it back youll
have to pay salvage said mr wilkinson

  now the sailor turned toward elizabeth
ill pay salvage lady he whined now
would a ten-pound note be agreeable say
the word lady he began to fumble in
his pocket

  dont take it bessie mr wilkinson
advised enjoying the affair as a child enjoys
a new kind of game take an old busi-
ness mans advice he offers fifty dollars-
well it must be worth a good deal more
lord love yer no lady there aint
nothin in that old chest but a few keep-
sakes and trinkets pictures of gals and
the likes of that i wouldnt give no ten
pounds if my eart wasnt kinder set on
em

   elizabeth bit her lip to repress a laugh
the sailor was lying so poorly that a child
would not have been deceived but what
could be in the chest something alive-
she had heard it move-something which
this man considered to be worth more than
fifty dollars it was worth finding out

  it couldnt be your box i found she
said at last

  and why aint it lady aint there no
eart cut in it

   yes i believe there is a heart

  well aint that proof enough lady
that its bill farleys chest right enough
is your name bill farley

  aye aye maam and youll find a
b and a f on the tother end burnt there
with a red-hot poker-rough i grant you
but plain to see in the sunlight

  thats all very well mr farley said
elizabeth very sweetly you seem to
know what the outside of the box looks
like but that isnt enough i believe you
said that there were a few trinkets inside
yes maam

   well that isnt so mr farley theres
something alive in that box


famous fantastic mysteries

  for a moment there was a disconcerting
silence the sailors crafty eyes wandered
here there and everywhere mr wilkin-
sons round face indicated surprise jay
began stroking his amber-colored mustache
thoughtfully at last captain ben spoke
up

  its no use bill farley or whatever
your name may be he said youve
gone and steered yourself into a fog none
of us here will rest easy till weve had a
peep into that chest of yourn youve lied
yourself into a heap more trouble than ten
pounds will buy yer out of

  suddenly elizabeth uttered a little cry of
horror have you a baby in that box
she asked excitedly

  perhaps hes a kidnaper jay sug-
gested theyre quite common

  hes got a bad face captain ben
muttered casting a suspicious look at the
cowering bill farley when a britisher
is bad hes most uncommon bad

  mr wilkinson took a step forward with
the air of a stern judge what have you
got in the box he demanded harshly

  the sailor looked from right to left as
though contemplating escape and then into
the faces of his persecutors tiny beads of
perspiration had gathered on his forehead
his eyes looked like those of a trapped ani-
mal

  i got- he paused for breath and
swallowed several times

  what they demanded almost in uni-
son

  i got a whimpus in that there chest
bill farley said a trifle wearily

chapter iii

a chinese mermaid

for several moments there was a dead
silence all regarded the sailor with
open-eyed amazement mr wilkinson was
the first to speak

  youve got a what he asked

  i got a whimpus bill farley repeated
stubbornly its a chinese mermaid fish
common enough on that coral island where
me and tom was cast away

  jay allowed himself an incredulous smile
where did you put that box captain
ben he asked

  its on the back porch sir will i get
it

  yes mr wilkinson broke in get it
this man must be drunk or mad a whim-
pus-a mermaid-whoever heard of such
nonsense

  captain ben turned away with a shake
of his head i told you more times than
once sir that there be strange creatures
in the sea what you never heard tell of
he mumbled

  bill farley stared sullenly at his boots
with the air of an abused man whats
the odds whether a chap lies or tells the
gospel truth he muttered e aint be-
lieved neither way

  a whimpus mr wilkinson continued
irritably and perhaps youll be kind
enough to tell us how you happened to
catch your mermaid

   will that said bill farley it ap-
pened this way i rigged up a kind of drag-
net while i was on that there coral island
and put it out each mornin to catch gay-
colored fish of which there was aplenty
one mornin i pulls the net in and finds
er lyin there as snug as a bug in a rug
she give rfie a start lookin at me most like
a gal with er big blue eyes kinder smilin
in er ead lord bill i says to myself
youve ad a touch of sun my poor lad 
here comes captain ben with the box
dad elizabeth broke in

  as she spoke her eyes were fixed on the
chest which the old fisherman carried and
once again that wave of incomprehensible
fear passed through her

  why open it dad she murmured
let the man have it

  it is doubtful if mr wilkinson heard
her at that moment he and jay were
bending over the box captain ben had
placed it on the veranda in a stream of
sunshine in this bright light the small
drilled holes so arranged that they formed
the outline of a human heart and the
blurred b and f were plainly to be seen
several knotted cords encircled the chest
the whimpus



jay with the impatience of a small boy on
christmas morning pulled out a penknife
and severed them mr wilkinson began
to lift the lid

  ave a care bill farley warned him
shes got a most uncommon nasty temper
with strangers youre like to lose a finger
if you dont watch your and

  mr wilkinson in spite of his incredu-
lous smile raised the lid slowly and cau-
tiously a shaft of sunlight stole into the
chest at the next moment he uttered an
ejaculation of amazement which was
echoed by jay captain ben hobbled up
and bent forward in his turn

  its a whimpus sure enough he cried
a shrill note of triumph ringing through
his voice like the clanging of an old
cracked bell what did i tell you mr
wilkinson do yer see that fishs tail and
them claws and them long pointed teeth
and she has yaller hair too same as that
feller said what had his finger bit off by
one of em but look at them gals eyes
aint they purty though-blue as sea-
shells yet with a sparkle to em aye
aye mr wilkinson this sure is a whim-
pus

  well im hanged if i ever saw any-
thing like it before jay muttered under
his breath

  even the financiers rather irritating
common sense was shattered for the
moment he stared down at the contents
of the sailors chest in blank amazement
his pursed lips seemed on the point of
emitting a long-drawn oh of astonish-
ment

  well now that you ave taken a squint
at my whimpus bill farley said sullenly
perhaps youll be so kind as to return a
poor mans property and let im be off
about his business

  the sailors words seemed to restore a
measure of mr wilkinsons presence of
mind not so fast said he straighten-
ing his back youve got a most pecu-
liar freak of nature here ill grant you
that the only one in existence i imag-
ine

  theres undreds and undreds of em

  on whimpus island bill farley said
composedly

  once more an incredulous smile flitted
across mr wilkinsons face i doubt
that very much said he however lets
come to terms youve got a freak in the
fish world here-something which will
cause considerable comment what did you
intend doing with it

  a sly secretive smile played for a mo-
ment beneath the sailors bulbous nose
creasing his face till it resembled a walnut-
shell this ere whimpus is worth mon-
ey he muttered i was thinkin of sell-
in er to a zoo

  that wont be necessary ill buy it
myself how would a hundred dollars
strike you

  a undred dollars-twenty pounds
gawd governor bill farleys face took
on an expresion of lively disgust this
whimpus is worth er weight in diamonds
i wouldnt take a thousand pounds for er
and thats a fact

  mr wilkinson nodded briskly very
well my man im afraid we cant do
business good afternoon

  the sailor seemed greatly relieved pass-
ing the back of his hand across his fore-
head he bent down awkwardly and laid
hold of the chest come on ome with
bill lizzie he muttered weve ad a
mighty tough day of it old gal

  hold on there mr wilkinson called
sharply what are you about you cant
have that fish until you pay salvage
you said it was worth its weight in dia-
monds that you wouldnt take a thousand
pounds for it-well that should make the
salvage pretty high

  gawd aint you ard on a poor chap
govenor bill farley released his hold
on the chest and straightend himself his
face drew up into knots of anxiety and
grief i cawnt pay no igh salvage cause

i	aint got no more than thirty pounds
in all the world this here whimpus is
mighty nigh my entire fortune

  now why not tell us the truth far-
ley the financier said in a kindlier tone
its no use lying-youve got something


famous fantastic mysteries

  up your sleeve why do you think this
fish is worth so much tell us the whole
story and i give you my word well deal
squarely by you

  bill farley hesitated and shifted uneasily
on his feet you ave me govenor he
said with a new note of respect in his tone
whichever way i turn you ave me a
poor seafarin chap aint got a dutchmans
chance with a far-seein gentleman like you
but i got a question to ask afore i spins
my yarn is that craft lyin so snug in
the cove your yacht govenor

  the adventurer yes she belongs to
me

  thats good news govenor now as
the young lady ere a bit of a ring a brace-
let or somethin kinder shiny which she
would lend a poor seafarin chap for the
sake of a test

  elizabeth nodded drawing a thin band
of gold from her finger she presented it to
the sailor

  thank yer kindly maam said he
now govenor lady and gentlemen will
yer take a little walk down to that pier
yonder and ill show you what lizzie ere
can do once shes sot her mind on it
what are you driving at mr wil-
kinson asked with some asperity

  never you mind govenor just you
step along with old bill and ell show you
whats what you aint afeared govenor
jay burst out into a laugh what do
you know about that he said he
thinks were afraid of his mermaid lets
see what hes got to show us down on the
pier

  very well said mr wilkinson with
an uneasy look at the water-soaked box
are you coming with us bessie
elizabeth shook her head not if
youre going to take that creature with
you

  surely youre not afraid of a fish bes-
sie jay broke in why you havent
even looked at it yet

  it isnt fear exactly i dont know
how to explain it its the same feeling i
have for a mouse-only a thousand times
worse ive had a horror of it from the

  very first if i looked at it i know id
scream

  poor old lizzie bill farley muttered
picking the box up in his arms you
aint very popular with the gals are yer
lizzie well govenor lead the way

  the four men descended the steps of the
veranda and started across the lawn toward
the pier which stretched out like a wooden
arm over the sea mr wilkinson and jay
led captain ben and bill farley brought
up the rear

  elizabeth watched them receding in the
distance with a wildly beating heart her
natural curiosity was battling with that
strange repulsion for which she was unable
to account at one moment she wished she
had accompanied them at the next she
was glad that she had remained where she
was

  the pier was several hundred yards from
the house elizabeth although she strained
her eyes was unable to ascertain what the
men were about by this time they had
reached their destination looking very
small and toylike they were bending for-
ward as though examining something

  an involuntary shudder passed through
the girls frame they were now opening
the box and examining that horrible crea-
ture which captain ben had described as
having long yellow hair and eyes like a
girls-that must be what theywere about
how could they do it men were callous
perhaps they would even touch it per-
haps jay her jay might fondle it might
run his fingers through its hair might-

  something very near akin to jealous rage
made elizabeth rise and hurry toward
them but before she had traversed more
than a quarter of the distance she encoun-
tered captain ben who had detached him-
self from the group on the pier and was
hobbling across the front lawn

  i was cornin up to tell yer all about it
missy he said smothering a yawn with
a huge fist you missed it its too late
now-theyve put the whimpus back in
her box

  what happened captain ben she
asked breathlessly
the whimpus



  the old man once more paused to open
his mouth in a cavernous yawn before he
answered funny how sleepy i feel i he
muttered

  what happened elizabeth repeated
impatiently

  why when we got down to the pier
that there sailor opened the box grabbed
the whimpus quick by the neck and jerked
her out she begin to scratch at him with
her claws and gnash her teeth-but it
werent no use for farley had her safe by
the neck all the time well missy he had
a piece of fishin line in his trouser-pocket
no sooner did she stop her antics than he
made it fast about her it was curious the
easy way he handled the critter

  what did he do then elizabeth asked

  why then he took that ring that you
give him and chucked it into the sea that
made me howlin mad i can tell yer i
never expected to see it no more have
yer taken leave of yer senses i says step-
pin forward with the thought of layin my
fist on that ugly jaw of his but he just
kinder smiles superior and throws his
whimpus overboard not forgettin to hold
on to the other end of the line watch my
lizzie he says very proud shes no end
of a gal when it comes to findin valua-
bles 

  and then what happened captain
ben

  why we all watched that there fishin
line goin out farther and farther then
all of a sudden it stopped dead and far-
ley begun to pull it in hand over hand
pretty soon that whimpus pops out of the
water and what do you think missy-
there was your ring gripped tight in her
claws

  it picked my ring up

  yes missy and farley let her keep
it for a while sayin them bright things
made the poor gal happy shes got it
along with her now in her box and shes
hummin like a thousand tops goin at
once

  humming

  aye aye missy she hums when shes
content farley says and its a soothin

sound-a most soothin sound the old
man broke off and once more displayed
his gums in a prodigious yawn

chapter iv

moonshine and madness

tfell now as i ave showed yer
v v what my lizzie could do let us
talk business govenor

  it was bill farley who spoke leaning
back comfortably in one of mr wilkin-
sons easy chairs a corpulent havana cigar
between his yellow teeth he surveyed the
others with a strange air of mingled civility
and triumph the financier his face still
mirroring astonishment and a measure of
expectancy crossed his plump legs and lit
a match elizabeth and jay interchanged
glances but remained silent captain ben
had taken up a trowel and was making a
pretense at weeding the flower-bed in the
shadow of the veranda while in reality
he was straining his old ears to catch any
scattered fragments of the conversation

  i dont see how your fishs accomplish-
ments alter the case mr wilkinson said
finally it recovered my daughters ring
certainly but my daughter recovered it
in a word the more valuable you make
your fish appear farley the higher salvage
may be demanded

  but you aint got me right govenor
the sailor cried lizzie is a valuable pos-
session-not because she aint known in
these parts not because she can pick up a
gold ring occasional but because she as a
fortune of all er own shes a capitalist
thats what my lizzie is

  im sure i dont know what youre
driving at mr wilkinson broke in

  look ere govenor-ill explain bill
farley leaned forward and knocked the ash
of his cigar off on the toe of his boot
theres a coral island in the china seas
where theres undreds and undreds of
lizzies them mermaid fish is all alike
theyre the same as gals-a diamond or a
gold ring anythin kinder dazzlin tickles
em to death now down on the bottom


famous fantastic mysteries

of the sea theres loads and loads of such
things lyin kinder careless about think
of the ships whats foundered off the china
coast govenor in them ragin typhoons
ships loaded down with gold and precious
stones and the like of that what do yer
think them whimpus as been doin these
thousands of years get my drift gove-
nor

  you mean that theyve been storing up
treasure-trove from wrecked vessels mr
wilkinson asked sitting up very straight
in his chair

  jay drew his breath in through his teeth
with a hissing sound oh-ho what an
idea he muttered

  thats what im a tellin yer bill
farley continued patiently them whim-
pus ave been stealin from foundered ships
since the world was new theres un-
dreamed-of wealth for the chap what finds
their cave govenor captain kidds
treasure wouldnt be a ante in that game
now suppose i knowed the whereabouts
of that island govenor and suppose lizzie
ere could do the rest

  mr wilkinson rose and began to pace
the veranda of course all this is just
foolishness he muttered and yet-

  you ave a tidy little yacht in the ar-
bor bill farley said hopefully just
you say the word govenor and ill pilot
yer to whimpus island well split the
pot-all ands what sails therell be
enough treasure to spare or sink me for a
dutchman

  mr wilkinson came to a sudden halt in
front of the sailor i want to hear all
about this he said querulously how
did you happen to get hold of this fish
itll pay you to stick to the truth

  gawd blast me if i lie govenor it
appened this way i was aboard the sea
king what went down in a tornado just off
the china coast me and black tom rigged
up a raft two days and two nights we
drifted and then we touched ground on
one of them coral islands which is as thick
as flees on a mangy dog in them parts
lucky for us there was a big ollowed-out
place in the center of the island which ad

caught a deal of rain-water for food we
ad the fish which was all colors of the
rainbow and sweet-tastin enough

  was that whimpus island

  aye aye govenor we didnt see ide
nor air of em for the first few days only
we eard a low ummin sometimes which
would put black tom and me to sleep like
we was kids one day black tom catches
one sunnin erself e come runnin to me
oldin er in a bit of fish-net

   just look ere bill e says swallow-
in ard look what this gal as in er
fist 

  well i gives er a stare and she stares
back at me as bold as you please through
the oles in the net pretty soon i see some-
thin shinin in er claws gawd i give
my eyes a rub but it werent no use that
there shinin stone in er fist was a diamond
as big as a robins egg

   we re rich men tom i says joyful
but e gives a shake of is ead bein
a gloomy sorrowful chap mostly we
might be bloody millionaires bill says e
but what good would it do us on this
blawsted gridiron

  well for all that black tom took the
diamond out of the whimpuss fist-though
e ad to treat er a bit rough first she
bein havaricious as are most females
then e made a pet of er feedin er bits
of fish and now and then givin er a swim
on the end of a cord and it was a most
unnatural thing to see that there fish and
black tom sleepin alongside one another
each night-she with er ead on is breast
er golden air brushin is cheek lord it
give me the creeps-the way she ad of
lookin at im like a lovesick gal on er
oneymoon and it made me feel kinder
lonesome too i began to wish i ad a
whimpus of my own

  one day i was all alone sunnin my-
self on a bit of rock black tom was out
walkin with is whimpus-though e did
all the walkin wadin about the island
while she swum alongside pretty soon i
ears a great ullabaloo and ere comes
black tom runnin fit to bust is lady
friend under is arm
the whimpus



   whats the row says i row says
e were the richest men in the world
bill and its all because of this little
gal ere then e gives is whimpus a
squeeze which makes er cock one blue
eye at me kinder coy

  ave you found another diamond

i asked

  a diamond bill says e kinder
scornful where i just come from theyre
as thick as pebbles on the beach

  then e went on to tell me as ow the
whimpus ad took im into a cave while
they was walkin and pretty soon they
come to a strip of sand where there was
a pile of rubies and diamonds and gold
pieces and there was bones too-human
bones white as chalk-and bits of junk
which werent no use to nobody

   you come away in a hurry says i
 i did that says e blinkin is eyes
at me solemn there was some skulls sil-
tin on them piles of precious stones and
they give me the creeps owsomever im
goin back now and take another squint
 ill go with yer says i

   no yer wont says e givin me a
nasty look twos company threes a
crowd e give a little itch to is knife
which i knew meant trouble dolly and
me  treat yer square bill e says but
we dont want yer nosin around in there
with that e starts back again with a
ugly grin at me over is shoulder and is
and on the aft of is knife now bein a
peaceful man myself avin sung in the
church choir in my youth i let im ave is
way-more especial as e was a wicked
chap to cross and as tall as a steeple pret-
ty soon i lost sight of im and is whimpus
behind a bit of rock and i never laid eyes
on either of em since that day govenor
bill farley paused to light his cigar
which had gone out elizabeth glanced at
jay and saw that his eyes were flashing
brightly and that there was a hectic splash
of color in each cheek she glanced at her
father and saw that he also showed
marked signs of excitement the sailors
box stood near the railing a low inter-
mittent buzzing sound came from it

  how is it that you never saw him
again mr wilkinson asked

  i dunno govenor that there cave e
told me about must ave swallowed im
like the whale swallowed jonah e never
come out alive-nor dead neither i
reckon

  did you discover the entrance of the
cave jay asked suddenly

  not me sir bill farley answered with
a weak smile black tom would ave
skinned me alive ad i followed im e was
a mean man when crossed but lizzie she
knows where that cave is right enough
how did you happen to catch your
whimpus mr wilkinson asked

  i catched er with a bit of net when
i was fishin off the rocks but i wasnt
takin no chances at explorin caves with
no one andy in case of trouble i put
lizzie in my old sea-chest and a day or
so later i got picked up by a tramp steamer
bound for new york natural enough i
didnt tell them what i knowed there
was too many ands aboard when i gets
to new york i says to myself ill find
some skipper i can trust and then- 
but how did the chest happen to be
in the water jay broke in

  bill farley moved his feet uneasily and
a guilty flush spread over his face that
tramp steamer went aground off wish-
bone point he muttered them custom
officers might ave made things ot for
lizzie and me so i took french leave in
one of the life-boats when none of the
crew was lookin pretty soon a squall
comes up and the boat capsizes lizzie
come aground ere but i swam to shore
half a mile farther up gawd i was near
out of my ead till that old chap told me
e ad seen my chest

  thats a very strange tale said mr
wilkinson chewing savagely on his cigar
if youre lying you do it very well

  bill farleys heavily wrinkled face took
on a grieved expression so elp me i
aint spinnin a yarn gove nor this ere
is gospel truth youve a sizable yacht in
the cove what do yer say if we go treas-
ure-untin


famous fantastic mysteries

  this is all moonshine and madness
mr wilkinson muttered still i was
thinking of taking a cruise and it might
as well be the china seas as anywhere
else

  im all for it jay cried enthusias-
tically this is the kind of thing which
makes life worth while

  suddenly a long solemn face appeared
over the railing of the veranda it was
captain bens what have i always told
yer mr wilkinson he said theres
more strange critters and strange adven-
tures out there-he pointed unsteadily
toward the surging stretch of sea-than
you ever heard tell of cant i go along
sir i aint so spry as i was but im a
deep thinker and all

  you can go captain ben cried mr
wilkinson with a strange note of boyish
enthusiasm in his voice how about you
bessie

  elizabeth nodded her head ill go too
dad she murmured perhaps i might
be able to help some way there might
be something that-

  suddenly she broke off a dozen feet
from her from the interior of the sailors
chest a strange flapping scratching sound
could be heard

  never you mind er maam said bill
farley with an embarrassed smile lizzie
as tantrums when she aint fed regular
poor gal shes ad a ard day

chapter v

anchors aweigh

for the next few days maple ridge as
mr wilkinsons country place was
called was humming with activity the
preparations for the extended voyage went
on apace and the obese financier at-
tended to the work with unusual anima-
tion

  captain ben and farley slept together in
the fishermans cottage they kept the
sailors chest in the same room with them
often and especially while the moon was
full the whimpus would emit that strange
humming sound so peculiar to it and at

these times the mens snores would grow in
volume till the tiny apartment seemed the
interior of some huge beehive

  but elizabeth unlike the others did not
view the contemplated cruise for treasure
with sparkling eyes and flushed cheeks
no on the contrary an involuntary tremor
passed through her when she thought of it
during these days a shadow dogged her
footsteps and because this shadow was so
vague in outline so incomprehensible it
was doubly terrifying

  what am i afraid of she would ask
herself am i afraid of a trip by sea to
the china coast

  no an inner voice would answer
you are afraid of arriving safely at an
island where there will be hundreds and
hundreds of creatures like that creature
which is now in the sailors box

  perhaps but why should i fear these
creatures i did not even see the one in
the box

  very true the voice would answer
with terrifying calmness but you have a
feminine intuition which tells you that
there are worse things than death-an
intuition which has shown you the mean-
ing of such creatures in your dreams
beware the whimpus was it not chanted
over your cradle by another woman who
in her turn heard it almost at dawn of
thought the whimpus that intangible
something which robs women of husbands
and homes-the whimpus that destroyer
of our faith in those we hold close to our
breasts that breaker of mens destinies
that flapping scratching creature of guile
-beware the whimpus

  and elizabeth could not rid herself of
that shadow she saw it reflected in her
fathers kindling eyes and flushed cheeks
she saw it written in the curve of jays
prominent chin and she noted that even
the aged captain ben bore its dread echo
in his shrill voice as the rusted antique
bugle holds the echo of war somewhere in
its dry throat like a relentless medusa
it was turning to stone all those kindlier
gentler traits of man somewhere in the
distance-on a coral island in the china
the whimpus



seas-strange flapping scratching crea-
tures were beckoning to them the men
heard their call they were going even
as bill farley had gone even as all men
had gone through all centuries it was
destiny-destiny sad for women to look
upon she was alone and they were many
she went unprotected and they were
armed with all the hidden guile of the
infinite what was waiting for her on
whimpus island

   at last came that never-to-be-forgotten
day when the adventurer who had not
earned her name till then weighed anchor
and swept majestically out of the harbor
into the open sea elizabeth from the up-
per deck watched the shore slip past and
finally disappear like a cloud of smoke
several gulls followed the yacht emitting
shrill plaintive cries the wind had fresh-
ened and a sprinkling of spray was borne
against her face the waves in a long
slanting procession marched gaily forward
against the prow of the adventurer only
to be disemboweled and cast aside they
seemed an army seeking suicide each
perished with a little gasp a few somber
-clouds rode the heavens they looked
down on the bright tumult beneath like el-
derly corpulent generals who watch the
battle from afar

   well maam ows it feel to go sailin
arter treasure

   it was bill farley who spoke h and
captain ben had sauntered over to the rail
within arms reach of elizabeths chair
they both wore a grin now that they were
safe at sea

   of course i feel very excited eliza-
beth murmured what have you done
with your fish mr farley

  who lizzie maam shes as safe
as a bug in a rug i ave er alongside my
ammock i wouldnt take alf a chance
with lizzie

   ill miss the sound of her to-night
bill captain ben broke in that there
whimpus has a soothin sound when a fel-
lers sleepy-a most soothin sound

   so i ave took notice matey bill
farley muttered reflectively shes dif-

ferent than most gals there-beggin your
pardon maam i ad a wife in singapore
once gawd that gal wouldnt lull yer off
to sleep none not er she was hall for
talk she ad a tongue like a tin knife
beatin on a fryin-pan give me lizzie
in a urricane to er

  the yacht had weighed anchor in the
late afternoon now night began to settle
down over the waste of tossing waters the
lips of foam which rode each wave seemed
encrusted with tiny sparks of living fire
the wake was a flaming phosphorescent
streak very gradually very timidly the
stars appeared and looked down vacantly
on the sea the moon rose grinning from
a patch of clouds far ahead it had an air
of jovial hospitality about it im glad
youve come it seemed to be saying
through its wide toothless mouth step
this way wont you ive got a surprise
for you on the other side of the world
elizabeth rose with a little shiver night
had suddenly reached out and gripped the
adventurer in her huge shadowy palm
mystery and adventure were all about in
those charging waves in that somber sky
in that surge and sweep in that power and
passion of the sea

chapter vi

an iron whirlwind

it was a calm day not a breath of air
ruffled the placid surface of the sea
which stretched out like some solid lumin-
ous substance the adventurer plowed
her way forward unconcernedly casting a
foam-capped furrow on either side

   aye aye governor bill farley said
in reply to a question of mr wilkinsons
we should sight whimpus island to-mor-
row night and a very fine cruise we ad of
it weather as though served to order and
no sea to speak of

   we aint there yet captain ben broke
in with a pessimistic shake of his grizzled
head its a treacherous sea at this time of
the year them iron whirlwinds pops up as
sudden as a devil out of hell

  an iron whirlwind jay asked


famous fantastic mysteries

   e means a typhoon govnor bill
farley explained they calls em iron
whirlwinds ereabouts

  at that moment elizabeth mounted the
companionway and joined the four men
isnt it warm she murmured

aye aye its ot bill farley replied
it is said captain ben i recol-
lect that it was on a day like this that-
hello mr wilkinson broke in
here comes the skipper i wonder what
he wants

  the tall lean figure of the captain of
the adventurer came striding toward them
his usually placid countenance wore a
lugubrious expression

  well what is it masters mr wil-
kinson asked

  the barometer has been falling for the
last hour sir i think were due a bit of
rough weather

  bill farley drew in his breath sharply
that looks bad ereabouts hemuttered

  bad signs both said captain ben
take an old sailors advice and dont let
a iron whirlwind sneak up behind yer when
youre not lookin listen whats that i
hear

  far away across the calm expanse of
water to the east a faint moaning could
be heard it was as though a grieving
human soul were wandering in that vast
amphitheater between sea and sky now
other voices joined it in a melancholy
chorus the pack was coming from all
sides-that pack of wind-wolves which
would soon be down on them with a rush
and a roar

  what is it mr wilkinson asked in
a bewildered tone

  theres a typhoon cornin up govnor
said bill farley tightening his leather belt
therell be ell presently take a squint
at the sky govnor

  even as he spoke great black clouds like
knights fully caparisoned for the lists rode
swiftly into the pale-blue sky they had
appeared with startling suddenness as
though they had been created in an instant
by some malevolent magician of the in-
finite and with their coming the whole

face of the heavens was altered a soft
glow suffused the heights above the sky
glowed ruby red in spots as though it were
a glass door against which gigantic tongues
of flame were pushing forward at any
moment one expected to see it come crash-
ing down in red-hot fragments

  suddenly the mournful wailing ceased
it was followed by a silence so profound
that the ticking of captain bens large
silver watch was distinctly audible to all
there was something awe-inspiring in this
silence one felt that all about in that
sullen sky in that motionless sea now shot
with fiery corrugations in those swiftly
gathering clouds a relentless force was
creeping forward noiselessly on hands and
knees

  a solid white wall had risen up from
the sea a mile or so away for an instant
it hovered there a mound of snow against
a murky background and then it swept
toward them with a sullen roar

  hurry missy hurry cried captain
ben in a high falsetto

  seizing elizabeths hand he half led and
half dragged her toward her cabin scarce-
ly had they stumbled down to compara-
tive safety before a huge wave tossed the
adventurer up on her beam-ends as though
she were a toy and a frantic tearing
wind like a mad old woman screaming
chuckling roaring circled about overhead
raking the yacht from stem to stern

  the sudden wild bound of the adven-
turer skyward threw elizabeth on the floor
of her cabin and captain ben head first
against the wall both were stunned for
a long time they lay there unconscious
of the progress of the typhoon

  when elizabeth opened her eyes again
night had fallen but what a strange night
it was-a luminous night which enveloped
the raging sea with a pall of fire through
the doorway she caught a glimpse of a
blood-red heaven indeed the sea and the
sky had apparently become as one-a fiery
brotherhood inseparable on the horizons
edge

  the typhoon had not abated in fury
since those first few blinding moments
the whimpus



on the contrary the ocean had been so
lashed by that terrific and luminous wind
that it had risen up in wild revolt threat-
ening the very sky great billows with
fiery locks charged down on the adven-
turer and tossed her heavenward in de-
rision each instant it seemed that she
must perish in those glowing chasms
ahead but she fought her way through
them somehow and rose up gamely on the
other side salt incrusted from her keel to
her smoke-stacks

  elizabeth was too weak to move she
lay there a blinding pain creasing her
forehead staring about her like a terror-
stricken child there was no light in the
cabin except those strange vivid flashes
which stole in through the doorway and
which served to illumine objects in a
fragmentary fashion now captain bens
face could be seen he lay within arms-
reach of elizabeth huddled up against
the wall she wondered if he were dead

  but now something happened which
made her forget captain ben entirely
suddenly the roaring of the wind died
down as though by magic-it was as
though nature were holding her breath-
and she heard strange flapping scratching
sounds in the cabin where the steps led up
to the main deck whatever it was it was
coming closer

  a great numbing fear enveloped eliza-
beth like a coverlet of snow only too well
she knew those flapping scratching sounds
she tried to scream but her voice was
frozen in her throat she tried to rise but
her limbs refused their office and now
even the luminous light from the sea failed
her an inky blackness succeeded it which
draped all things in impenetrable shadow

  but the flapping scratching sounds con-
tinued they were not more than two feet
away-now less than a foot-now- sud-
denly she felt something cold and sharp
touch her outstretched palm

  lizzie a hoarse voice shouted liz-
zie where ave yer got to lizzie

  bill farleys dark figure blocked the
cabin door striking a match he peered
about him anxiously at this moment cap-

tain ben sat up and rubbed bis head
  whos that he called weakly

  its bill farley matey ave yer seen
my lizzy ereabouts that there iron
whirlwind smashed my chest agin the
wall and lizzie took it into er ead to
bkedaddle

  captain ben drew an electric flash-light
from his pocket and touched the button
as the cabin became illumined bill farley
uttered a cry of joy

  there she is he shouted jubilantly
lizzie old gal dont you go for to desert
bill come out from under that bed afore
i go arter yer blime if this aint luck

before dawn the typhoon wore itself
out all night the adventurer had been
running before the hurricane like a chip
in a mill-race nowshe was able to pursue
her course unmolested the wind had died
down to a gentle breeze and although
the waves still rode mountain high their
crests were no longer flecked with foam
soon the sun rose and looked down re-
assuringly on a wind-scarred sea

  the passengers of the yacht looking
much the worse for the nights rough usage
gathered under the awning on the after-
deck

  here comes captain masters said
elizabeth suddenly he seems to be
rather excited

  perhaps the old tubs sprung a leak
bill farley suggested these pleasure-
boats aint built for seas like we was ridin
all of last night

  by now captain masters had drawn up
alongside the owner of the adventurer
theres land off our port bow he said
raising his hat a coral island i believe
sir

  you dont say so mr wilkinson be-
gan to fumble with his case of binoculars
i think ill take a look at it masters
bill farley silently went aft reappearing
a moment later with a long brass telescope
i can see it now jay said shielding
his eyes with the palm of his hand there
was a curtain of mist hiding it but its
rising

  bill farley raised the telescope to his
eye and gazed long and attentively sud-
denly it began to shake oddly gawd
he muttered if it aint whimpus island
there must be some mistake mr
wilkinson cried we couldnt have run
into it by accident like this

  nary a mistake govnor there she is
just as i seen her last shaped like a orse-
shoe and all and theres that bit of
flag-pole what me and my mate rigged up
with black toms red flannel drawers still
flappin there or whats left of em

  jay took the telescope from his hand
hes right mr wilkinson he said at
length at least i can see the pole and
something red flying from it

  run in closer masters mr wilkin-
son ordered

  the adventurer ran slowly forward it
came to a halt along the coral shores
which glowed like molten metal in the
sun a great splash of foam told that the
anchor had been lowered

  whats that jay cried suddenly i
thought i saw something dive off that ledge
of coral into the water

  it was a whimpus govenor said bill
farley composedly i saw er myself
theres undreds ere-undreds

  when shall we begin searchin for the
treasure captain ben asked moving his
nutcracker jaws as though he were chew-
ing a delectable morsel im most too tired
to go skinnin my shins on diamonds till
ive had a few winks of sleep

  and me too matey bill farley agreed
my eadsswimmin around im that wore
out lets us ave our beauty sleep gov-
ernor afore we tackle treasure-untin
id like to start right now jay cried
impatiently weve got all the rest of
our lives to sleep

  but mr wilkinson shook his head no
no jay captain ben and farley are right
we want to start at this thing when we
can do our best lets turn in now and in
the afternoon we can land and look over
the ground

  right you are govenor bill farley
cried with alacrity im off to my am-

mock this minute sweet dreams to one
and all with a smile which was half a
grimace and a bow which bent him double
the sailor turned and made off toward his
quarters

  i dont fancy that fellows manners
jay said with a flush hes entirely too
free and easy what he needs is a strenu-
ous toe-application on the right spot

  never mind jay mr wilkinson said
we can teach him his place after hes
found the treasure for us but speaking
about place mine should be in a downy
couch this minute how about you bes-
sie

  im awfully tired dad im going to
turn in

  every one is goin to take a snooze
captain ben said even the crew cap-
tain masters has give orders to that effect
well they deserve it the poor lads
smothering a yawn he turned and hobbled
off

  fifteen minutes later elizabeth lay on
her berth in the cabin sound asleep

  almost immediately she heard the muffled
sound of oars working smoothly in well-
oiled oarlocks

  when the girl awoke the red rays of
the setting sun streamed through the port-
hole

  conscious that some one was pound-
ing on the door she sat up and rubbed
her eyes

  who is it she called softly

  its jay said a voice which shook with
anger i came to wake you what do
you think happened while we were all
asleep

  i havent an idea what the girl
asked

  why that cockney sailor sneaked off to
whimpus island in one of our life-boats
and he hasnt come back

  what of it probably hes taking a
little row hell be back for supper she
said

  a bitter incredulous laugh rasped
through the keyhole i fancy not jay
said calmly hes taken his whimpus
with him

          chapter vii

aye aye sir-just fish

elizabeth dressed quickly and hur-
ried oji deck in spite of jays dis-
appo-ntment she felt relieved at the dis-
appearance of the sailor and his whim-
pus she had great difficulty in hiding her
real feelings from the group of excited
angry men whom she encountered near the
empty davits where the missing life-boat
had reposed

  this is a pretty kettle of fish missy
captain ben cried in his high treble but
i never liked that britisher from the first

  i cant see his game mr wilkinson
said irritably how can he double-cross
us weve got the yacht and without
that all the treasure in the world wouldnt
do him any good

  hes got something up his sleeve jay
muttered

  funny we cant see him on the island
mr wilkinson said thoughtfully hes
probably hiding on the other side of that
mound

  or in the treasure-cave captain ben
suggested thats where hes at-fillin
his pockets with diamonds i wouldnt
wonder

  elizabeth shaded her eyes and gazed
over the now calm stretch of water toward
whimpus island to the west a red sullen
sun swam on the horizon it colored the
coral with a last faint glow before it sank
beneath the surface of the sea the wind
had died away not a breath of air ruffled
the placid surface and the red rags which
had once served as a part of black toms
wardrobe hung disconsolately from the
flagpole

  suddenly the girl uttered a shrill cry
why theres the boat now she said
no two of them-one right behind the
other

  mr wilkinson raised the binoculars to
his eyes in some excitement after a mo-
ment he lowered them with an exclamation
of disgust its only masters he told
his daughter we sent him to look for
farley in the other life-boat

  yes but there are two boats coming
this way

  masters has farleys boat in tow he
probably found it on the island

  well the man cant dodge us jay
cried hell stay on the island till we
say the word i think weve got him where
we want him

  perhaps he drownded captain ben
suggested a lot of them sailors cant
swim i recollect one time off gibraltar
there was just such another feller-

  but mr wilkinson interrupted the old
fisherman with scant ceremony raising
his voice to a bellow he hailed captain
masters who was not more than a stones
throw from the adventurer

  is farley on the island

  he must be there sir captain masters
answered through his speaking-trumpet
we found his boat pulled up on the
shore

  hiding in the cave mr wilkinson
muttered well well starve him out but
i dont see his little game

  nor i jay agreed he stands to
win nothing by acting this way but
dont you think we could find the cave
without him or his whimpus

  not me said captain ben its like
lookin for a needle in a haystack that
there island is hollowed out with caves
thousands and thousands of em we aint
got no chance without a whimpus

  for the next few days a cloud o de-
spondency hung over the adventurer in
vain the coral island was kept under strict
surveillance not a vestige of bill farley
was to be seen in vain exploring parties
ransacked it from end to end no cave in
an way resembling black toms descrip-
tion was to be found at the end of the
week even jay had given up hope un-
doubtedly bill farley and his secret had
died together

  on the following monday mr wilkinson
made known his intention of quitting the
island and starting home were just
wasting our time here he told jay if
bill farley were still alive wed have heard
from him before this


famous fantastic mysteries

  i suppose so the young man muttered
he must have fallen into some hole and
broken his neck but it seems a shame to
turn back without getting a glimpse of the
treasure

  mr wilkinson nodded solemnly i
know but whats to be done ive told
masters to weigh anchor to-morrow

  at this moment captain bens decrepit
figure was seen approaching across the
deck at a strange ambling trot he was
waving his arms about like a windmill his
long white hair was flying in the wind

  well what is it mr wilkinson asked

  the old man moistened his lips and
launched out into speech ive been fish-
in for the last few days while you all have
been searchin this island theres some
most curious fish in these parts-gay-
colored with tails most like a ladys
fan and pop eyes like a frog but theyre
tasty too when cooked with plenty of
butter

  is that all youve got to tell us about-
fish jay cried impatiently i thought
that perhaps youd discovered something
so its just fish eh

  aye aye sir-just fish said captain
ben a sly smile creeping under his nose

  well

  well mr wilkinson this mornin i
lost my sinker and havin nothin handy
but a gold goat which my sisters son give
me for a watch-charm i hitched it on my
line till i could find somethin better and
threw it overboard now i didnt get a
bite for nearly ten minutes then all of a
sudden somethin gives that line a awful
jerk whats this i says to myself for
the coral fish dont pull near so hard per-
haps a young shark has laid hold well i
pulled that fish up on deck although i had
a sweatin time of it and what do you
think it was gentlemen

  im sure i dont know said jay

  was it a shark mr wilkinson asked

  captain ben surveyed his employer with
an air of triumph not so you could
notice said he that there fish was
nothin more nor less than a whimpus

  a whimpus cried mr wilkinson

  yes sir as like to bills lizzie as two
peas just as ugly natured too she had
laid hold of that gold goat and when i
tried to pry it free she begins bubblin
like a tea-pot and gnashin her teeth well
i tied her up in a net and give her the
goat to play with for a spell

  where is she now mr wilkinson
asked

  down in my quarters sir shes safe
enough

  if this is true jay cried with flashing
eyes if captain ben has actually caught
another whimpus we dont need bill far-
ley at all we can take that whimpus on
shore and let it lead us to its cave well
tie a string to its claw eh

  lets land on the island the first thing
to-morrow morning mr wilkinson said

  not one or two of us but every man
on board and well go armed whatever is
in that cave must have finished bill farley
off

  probably jay agreed but lead us
to your whimpus captain ben

the life-boat was lowered carefully
into the sea one by one the men each
armed with a revolver climbed down the
rope ladder and seated themselves captain
ben jay and mr wilkinson were the last
to leave the deck they all turned to eliza-
beth for a final word of leave-taking

  well be home in time for lunch jay
said do you see this bessie he held
a large canvas bag aloft i brought it
along so that i could bring back the dia-
monds and gold

  dont look so downhearted bessie
mr wilkinson said good-humoredly id
take you along if we didnt have a lot of
climbing and wading in front of us too
rough work for a girl eh captain ben

  true enough sir

  have you got the whimpus safely
aboard

  that i have sir i got her in a bird-
cage one of the men had these whimpus
can cut up rough

  what will i do if anything should hap-
pen to you dad elizabeth asked
the whimpus



  what could happen to us mr wil-
kinson said reassuringly were eight
strong and all armed to the teeth dont
worry bessie-well be back for lunch

  all aboard cried jay the sooner we
start the sooner well be back with the
booty

  but captain ben lingered for an instant
after the other two had clambered down
into the boat dont you fret missy he
said giving her shoulder a furtive pat
well make out all right ive got a
wise head on my shoulders

  but in spite of these reassuring words
elizabeth felt a lump rising in her throat
when she saw the life-boat push off and the
oars flash in the early sunlight ever since
the preceding afternoon when the second
whimpus had been caught and she had
learned of the intended expedition the girl
had been the prey of wild fancies all
night dark forebodings of she knew not
what had haunted her pillow and now a
settled despondency enveloped her opti-
mism like a wet blanket

  for some time she stood at the rail
watching the progress of the life-boat
finally after it had disappeared around
one of the curving arms of whimpus
island she turned away with a sigh and en-
tered her cabin

  elizabeth glanced about in search of
some refuge from herself she saw a book
lying on the table within arms reach pick-
ing it up hurriedly she opened it at random
and began to read unfortunately for her
peace of mind the book happened to be a
volume of poes verses the particular
poem she turned to was the bells and
those lines which run

    they are neither man nor woman-

    they are neither brute nor human-

    they are ghouls-

  she dropped the volume with a cry of
disgust and hurried up to the main deck
it was well past noon a blazing sun rode
the sky casting its rays on whimpus island
which seemed to be wavering in the intense
heat elizabeth gazed long in that direc-
tion but she could see no vestige of hu-
manity on the shimmering shore

  its nearly one oclock the girl mur-
mured ive half a mind to go and see
whats happened to them

  there was a small skiff on the after-deck
which she had often used when at home
to-day the sea was so calm that a canoe
could have ridden it with perfect safety
acting on a sudden impulse she lowered
the skiff into the water and in a moment
more was seated in the stern paddling
swiftly toward whimpus island

  in less than fifteen minutes the skiff
grounded on the shore and elizabeth began
her search

  whimpus island extended for nearly
three miles in breadth however it rarely
exceeded two hundred yards the walking
was very rough there were all manner of
hummocks which rose up like bumps on a
bald head and fissures in the coral which
had to be taken into account

  elizabeth was a strong active girl but
she was nearly worn-out before she had
circled the island every now and then she
stopped to rest at these times she called
aloud whereupon her voice would be
caught up by every cave and echoed back
hollowly but no human voice answered
hers no human figure met her eye in all
that weary tramp indeed a blight seemed
to rest on the island unlike any other
which she had ever seen no sea-gulls
whined about its cliff and no grasses grew
even where there was a stretch of solid
soil

  they must still be in the cave eliza-
beth murmured in a vain effort to fight off
growing depression it wont do any good
hunting for them ill go back to the boat
and wait there

  when she came to this decision she was
standing on the hummock from which
black toms gaudy nether garments flut-
tered brazenly in the wind the girl tired
in both body and mind seated herself for
an instant beneath this barbaric emblem
and rested her chin in her hands several
paces from her a long red fissure in the
coral seemed to grin at her as though it
were a human mouth

  suddenly she heard a strange sound


famous fantastic mysteries

which made her start and look up it was
a dull droning like the humming of innum-
erable bees not unmusical and rather
soothing except for an occasional loud
snort which broke into it like a peremptory
command these sounds evidently issued
from the fissure already alluded to

  what can it be elizabeth wondered
she walked over to the fissure and tried to
peer down

  now the dull buzzing sounds grew loud-
er suddenly there came such a loud snort
from the shadowy depths that elizabeth
involuntarily recoiled

  sea-lions she murmured ive heard
them snort just like that in the zoo the
buzzing sound must be water running into
some cave no doubt the tide rises and
falls

  at last she retraced her steps to where
she had left the skiff and with a heavy
heart paddled back to the adventurer as
she neared the yacht hope rose up in her
perhaps they had returned while she had
been out of sight on the other side of the
island perhaps they were safe on board
laughing at her fears

  making the skiff fast she clambered
aboard the adventurer and was greeted by
silence and shadows a glance at the empty
davits where the life-boat usually reposed
blighted her hopes she experienced a mo-
ment of complete weakness sinking down
on the hard deck she began to sob

  night was slowly falling a gray mist
stole up silently from the water enveloping
whimpus island in an impenetrable curtain
of mystery the sun sank with startling
suddenness as though its fiery light had
been extinguished by the touch of that
calm luminous sea a legion of languid
shadows stole about the hysterical girl on
noiseless feet they bent backward and
forward like flowers fondled by the breeze
they pointed at whimpus island with
ghostly fingers they were like embodied
dreams which seek release

  but elizabeth wept on quite unheeding
their silent supplications wept on while
the stars opened timidly like frightened
eyes wept on while the moon grinning

rose up triumphantly as though to say
well what did i tell you here we are
on the other side of the world look where
i am looking and you will see something
very strange come this is a surprise

chapter viii

a woman and a whimpus

the hours which followed the disap-
pearance of the treasure-hunters
seemed like so many years to elizabeth
all alone on the adventurer a prisoner
in a floating prison she experienced a
thousand and one terrors which threat-
ened her very reason

  at one moment she would abandon her-
self to despair at the next a sudden
sound-the swishing of water against the
ships side the creaking of an overtaxed
beam-would make her leap to her feet in
a frenzy of hope

  a hundred times during that first terri-
ble night she thought she heard the
squeaking of oar-locks then she would
hurry up on deck her heart beating wildly
expecting to see the life-boat pull up along-
side at each disappointment her spirits
would sink again into the darkest depths
of despondency

  the next morning she paddled her skiff
to shore and searched the island from end
to end she returned sadly to the ship

  on the third day all hope deserted her
straining her eyes across the silver-shod
sea she saw the island like a sinister red
question-mark standing out against a pale
blue page not a vestige of life was stirring
there black toms tattered garments-
how dear how human a symbol after
all-waved in melancholy triumph over a
hot blistering waste of coral

  perhaps it was this still vivid remnant
of a brave man who had gone to his ever-
lasting rest perhaps it was a fine frenzy
of despair but certain it is that elizabeth
took her courage in both hands and went
out alone to battle against the whimpus

  very calmly though with a wildly beat-
ing heart she went down to captain bens
quarters ransacked his belongings and re-
the whimpus



turned on deck with a strong fishing-line
her next problem was to bait the hook
properly she examined her trinkets one
by one and finally decided on the ring
which jay had given her on the day of their
engagement why did she choose this ring
among all the others was it because she
loved it best or perhaps because it sym-
bolized her love which was as keen and
brave as a sword

  elizabeth lowered her bait carefully over
the side bending forward she saw it slip
into the water which was as clear as crys-
tal saw it sink down slowly into the
depths saw a host of flaming darts shoot-
ing this way and that-coral fish which
were all colors of the rainbow-and finally
saw it resting on a strip of snow-white
sand for several minutes she stood there
immovable staring down and then she ut-
tered a low exultant cry

  several dark gliding shapes began to ap-
proach the glittering bait they formed
about it in a solemn circle as though de-
ciding elizabeth caught a glimpse of
slowly moving tails beneath a long silky
substance which trailed out behind and
which glimmered dully surely these were
whimpus she even caught a glimpse of
an outstretched avaricious claw what was
in that held them back why didnt they
bite

  she leaned forward further still and saw
the answer to her question mirrored on the
placid water her own face looked back
at her yes evidently the whimpus had
seen her now they were pointing upward
with their clawlike fingers now they were
stealing off in a stately procession soon
they had disappeared

  perhaps they are as afraid of me as i
was afraid of them elizabeth told herself

  this thought gave her a new confidence
and a new idea pulling the line up hand
over hand she hurried into her cabin and
opening one of the port-holes wide threw
her bait out into the sea then she seated
herself and waited

  in her present position she could not be
seen from the water if they had not gone
too far away perhaps they would return

and nibble now that she had disappeared
at any rate it was just possible

  for five minutes ten minutes elizabeth
sat as silent as a statue with a white face
and flashing eyes and then just as she
was about to pull the line in and cast again
she felt a violent jerk which nearly pulled
her to her feet the line had suddenly
grown taut and it took all her strength to
hold it

  and then the struggle began elizabeth
was an athletic girl her muscles served
her well that day little by little with
gasping breath and straining arms she
fought it out often she gained a yard
only to lose it again but now her fight-
ing blood was up she knew no weakness
or fear

  gradually inch by inch the girl drew
the whimpus to the surface of the water
and then above it now it was dangling
in the air now it shot through the port-
hole like an arrow and fell flapping and
scratching to the floor

  then at last the whimpus relinquished
its frenzied hold on the glittering bait
moving its small round head from side to
side it clawed its tangle of golden hair
from its face and stared at elizabeth slow-
ly the large blue eyes became dilated with
fear the large loose-lipped mouth fell open
disclosing sharp yellow fangs the tail
flapped wildly and both claws were raised
on high like terror-stricken hands

  and elizabeth looked at this monster
concocted in the laboratories of the sea-at
this creature half fish and half vampire
at this composition of scales and flesh-
with horror it is true but without fear
her imagination had long ago pictured it
she had seen it so often in her dreams that
now the reality was not so difficult to view

  and thus it was that a woman and a
whimpus faced each other for the first
time since the world began-while the
clock in the cabin ticked on contentedly
while the chairs presented their stolid
wicker backs like disinterested strangers
while the sea as though amused at what it
saw tickled the yachts sides and laugh-
ing merrily sped by

chapter ix

treasure trove

elizabeth was the first to act a

colossal calmness had descended upon
her which had crystallized her every
thought her every sensation into a well-
formulated plan she must not fail now
she realized with a perfect clarity of vision
that all her hopes of ultimate happiness
her life and the lives of her dear ones de-
pended on an immediate exertion of her
mental and physical powers she loathed
this abysmal monster on the floor with both
a fleshly and spiritual loathing but she
must not falter in her self-appointed task

  there was a large wicker lunch-basket
on the chair beside her picking it up she
raised the lid and took a step forward

  and the whimpus which up to this
had been in an attitude of frozen horror
its clawlike hands raised above its head-
now seemed to read its adversarys intent
hissing faintly its fishy eyes covered by a
gray film of fear it squirmed backward as
elizabeth advanced till finally its flapping
tail touched the wall there it paused and
with gnashing teeth and extended nails
awaited the attack

  but the girl did not hesitate stepping
bravely forward she bent down and at-
tempted to force the creature into the
lunch-basket hissing it squirmed to one
side and escaped once more she essayed
her task and this time the whimpuss
sharp teeth were embedded for a moment
in her arm

  now a blind fury drove elizabeth on
as she felt the sudden pain her left hand
found the monsters throat and tightened
there till it relinquished its hold to gasp
for breath till its tongue protruded like a
scarlet streamer till its eyes were nearly
popping from its head and then she lifted
it from the floor lifted it and held it at
arms length her fingers like steel rings
still encircled its slender throat

  but as the whimpuss pale leprous face
turned scarlet as its blood-shot eyes rolled
upward till nothing was visible of them but
their crimson-threaded whites she relaxed

her hold it would never do to kill it out-
right it must serve her first it must guide
her to her loved ones

  the whimpus squirmed only very feebly
now elizabeth had no difficulty in placing
it in the lunch-basket where it lay flapping
faintly her next task was to tie the fish-
ing-line securely about its waist where the
fishs tail joined the womans body now
it could not escape but its swimming pow-
ers would remain unimpeded

  she then closed the lid on her prisoner
secured it and carried the lunch-basket up
on deck

  she tied a handkerchief about the
wound and climbed down the ladder still
holding the lunch-basket and into the skiff
slipping the oars into place she bent her
strong supple back to the task and was
soon propelling the boat swiftly toward
the island

  when the skiff was finally grounded on
the shore she sprang out with all the
eagerness of one who goes willingly to
battle

  elizabeth opened the lunch-basket and
drew out the whimpus the monster by
this time had regained some of its
strength as she held it suspended in mid
air on the end of the fishing-line it
squirmed frantically gnashed its teeth and
emitted a strange hissing sound

  for a moment she swung it back and
forth to see that the line held then she
threw it from her into the sea

  at first the whimpus swam straight out
with incredible swiftness-so fast indeed
that she was put to it to give it free play
-but after it had traversed a hundred
yards or so it turned and began to creep
back further down the shore fortunately
the fishing-line was very long but at
that she was soon forced to follow it along
the beach

  in this way elizabeth half circled the
island at last she came to a tangle of salt
grass which grew in profusion against one
of the coral cliffs to her amazement the
fishing-line passed through this tangle as
if the creature on the other end had clam-
bered back on shore and yet this seemed
the whimpus



impossible for the shoulder of the island
at this point was precipitous

  as she paused before the green swaying
door of salt grass there came another tug
on the line which showed her that the
whimpus was still in active flight pushing
the nodding sea-foliage aside with her left
hand she uttered an ejaculation of sur-
prise

  there in the coral wall was a cave hol-
lowed out as though by human hands
undoubtedly this subterranean passage-
way led into the very heart of the island
perhaps the whimpus was leading her into
the treasure-chamber where dead or alive
she might find the missing passengers of
the adventurer

  elizabeth with a wild beating heart
stepped through the dark portal and was
immediately swallowed up in the gloom
not a light glimmered soon the opening
in the cave was lost to view walking in
pitch blackness a stream of running water
above her ankles the taut line leading
her forward as a blind man is guided by
holding to the leash of some intelligent
dog she stumbled on for a hundred yards
or more suddenly a strange sound came
to her out of the darkness far ahead

  elizabeth paused and listened in spite
of a sudden angry tug on her wrist there
it was again-only louder now a drowsy
humming sound it was followed almost im-
mediately by a loud snort

  it is no telling whether elizabeth could
have mustered up enough courage to go
further had not the whimpus at that mo-
ment given the line such a frenzied jerk
that she was carried forward a step in
spite of herself this step was the decid-
ing one there was no use turning back
now behind her lay loneliness starvation
death before her well that might be
quicker at any rate

 the frightened girl waded onward
through the blackness while the strange
sounds grew louder and louder now a
gray shaft of light stole around a bend in
the passage she reached it she turned an
brupt shoulder of rock and uttered a cry
vvhich echoed through the vault she was

destined never to forget the sight which
met her eyes

  the passageway here terminated in a
spacious hall through a fissure in the ceil-
ing javelins of flaming sunlight poured
down on a strip of shimmering sand which
barely raised its head above the shallow
water and on this sand piled up in a
glittering heap and indiscriminately min-
gled were precious stones pieces of colored
glass yellow bars of gold brass door-knobs
a childs toy sword several helmets which
the soldiers of caesar might have worn rat-
tles with colored beads a crown set with
gigantic emeralds which might have
adorned some fair egyptians brow but
one and all caught the shafts of sunlight
and reflected them casting a luminous light
on the dark dripping walls and on the
pale sheet of water

  it was not the sight of these precious
stones and glittering gewgaws which wrung
the cry from elizabeth no it was the
group which sat about this treasure in a
solemn circle-these men with their chins
resting on their breasts these skeletons
from whom hung in tatters the clothing of
an earlier age these gleaming skulls and
moldy thigh-bones more aged relics still
which time had crumbled into little pow-
dery heaps beneath the weight of its relent-
less hand and also it was that outer ring
of custodians which guarded both-that
swimming ring of whimpus whirling round
and round in a magic circle and emitting
that strange unearthly humming sound as
they went-those singular creatures that
were neither brute nor human their large
blue eyes fixed with a glassy stare on what
rested on that strip of sand their long
golden hair floating behind them in a filmy
gauze

  scarcely had elizabeths cry echoed
through the chamber than a change took
place the humming died away as though
by magic now a hundred pairs of terror-
stricken eyes were turned on her a hun-
dred pairs of terror-stricken clawlike hands
were raised on high a hundred scaly tails
churned the water into foam once twice
the whimpus sped around the strip of sand


famous fantastic mysteries

and then straight toward her and the pas-
sageway

  she floundered to one side the fishing-
line dropped from her nerveless hand the
next instant they were past her gliding by
swiftly and out into the passageway leav-
ing a trail of foam they vanished in the
gloom she was left entirely alone with the
dead

  but ah no they were not all dead
what was that surely it was a human
snore-a snore so awe-inspiring so sonor-
ous that from a distance it had seemed
the snorting of an animal in pain

  elizabeth stepped cautiously forward
the light reflected from the heap of treas-
ure was blinding she shaded her eyes with
her hand

  could it be yes it was there was
no doubt about it the snorer was captain
ben there he sat his cavernous mouth
gaping his hairy fists doubled on his knees
and next to him his head resting on his
shoulder a strang expression of physical
loathing on his face sat-jay surely there
was her father on his right sleeping sound-
ly his chin resting on his breast and the
other sleepers were the crew of the adven-
turer none were dead as yet-thank god
-not one

  elizabeth put her hand on captain bens
shoulder and shook him wake up she
cried wake up

  the old mans stentorian snore ceased on
the instant he raised his face and eliza-
beth saw that it was bedewed with perpira-
tion dont you touch me he muttered
cant you see im an old man i-i-
its bessie the girl cried dont
you know me

  suddenly the light of recognition flared
up in the old fishermans eyes oh
missy he said feebly like a frightened
child take me out of here i want to go
home missy

  but elizabeth was shaking jay wake
up wake up

  the young man opened his gray eyes
oh he cried get me out of here
oh bessie dearest girl its you you dont
know what a horrible dream ive had

  but elizabeth had turned to her father
  wake up dad she cried

  what do you want the financier
muttered oh dolly dolly shameful
dolly

  wake up dad

  and then mr wilkinson opened his eyes
and stared solemnly at his daughter ive
had a nightmare bessie he said get
me out of here if you can im about all
in 

  but elizabeth woke the others first
captain masters and his crew last of all
she came to bill farley he was sitting
beside a skeleton which still wore a tat-
tered sailorsuit the cockney had a senti-
mental smile playing beneath his bulbous
nose one of his arms were buried to the
elbow in a heap of precious stones the
other clasped the body of a dead whimpus
to his breast his eyes were swallowed in
cavernous hollows his lips were a chalky
white

  wake up elizabeth cried bravely
although the mans face frightened her
wake up

  bill farley was silent but his smile
broadened and twitched his upper lip
above two yellow fangs

  wake up she cried again shaking
him violently

  the sailor did not move but his eyes
flickered open for an instant i ears you
maam he said very faintly call louder
maam a girl such as you can pull a chap
outer ell if she tries real ard call
louder maam

  once more elizabeths voice echoed
through the chamber wake up she
cried its time we went home

  again bill farleys white lips moved
it aint a bit of use maam im goin
ome but not with you black tom ere
is more my kind e and me-them whim-
pus as got us soul and body lizzie ere
she kept on singin to me on the adven-
turer it werent me that double-crossed
yer maam it was er gawd what was a
poor sailor-man to do she ad a old on
me most as strong as a gal and she was all
for gettin ome i guess i-
the whimpus



  the muffled voice died away the long
lean head rolled over on one shoulder a
frozen sentimental smile was still stamped
on the chalky lips

  it aint no use missy captain ben
said touching her on the arm that fel-
lers dead let us clear outer here afore
them things come back i had a horrid
dream missy

chapter x

three weeks later

the adventurer her engine beating
rhythmically like a human heart
plowed through the shadowy sea to the
west a last faint crimson streak in the
sky showed where the sun had struggled
for the mastery and died now night ruled
the world

  elizabeth captain ben mr wilkinson
and jay sat on the after deck a silence
had fallen between them which was broken
only by the faint gurgling of the fisher-
mans ancient pipe as he inhaled silver
threads of smoke into his lungs the girl
was the first to speak

  you havent told me how you happened
to fall asleep there she said with some
asperity that would be the last thing
id do after finding all those precious
stones

  captain ben cleared his throat mr wil-
kinson rose and walked to the rail jay
seemed engrossed in a silent contemplation
of the stars

  well arent any of you going to tell
me

  captain ben took the pipe out of his
mouth and yawned yes missy he said
ill spin you the yarn but remember
youre a gal and theres lots of things gals
cant seem to get into their heads

  i wouldnt be so sure of that cap-
tain ben

  well its as true as gospel missy just
you take them whimpus for instance they
couldnt do you no harm cause youre a
gal and they aint got no power over gals
you was stronger than they was and they
knowd it there aint a whimpus livin

what can hold her own against a decent gal
like you missy theyre common critters
mostly

  but i want to know how you happened
to fall asleep in that cave

  aye aye missy ill tell yer the
whimpus what had us in tow led us into
that cave as pretty as you please when
we seen all them diamonds and things we
didnt stop for nothin-just waded through
them swimmin whimpus and climbed up
on the sand and begin to play with the
jewels like we was babies even the skele-
tons didnt scare us none-though bill far-
ley give me kind of a start when i seen
that silly grin on his mug well you know
the sound them whimpus made while they
was swimmin

  yes said elizabeth it got on my
nerves it was a most unpleasant sound
captain ben shook his aged head it
might have sounded unpleasant to you
missy cause youre a gal but it didnt to
us lord no it was a soothin sound-a
most soothin sound well pretty soon i
give up countin diamonds and take a look
about me what do you think i saw
missy why there was your pop mr jay
and them sailors all fast asleep they had
kinder silly grins on their faces-leastwise
so i thought

  you old liar cried jay with some
heat i heard that snore of yours before
i even closed my eyes

  and i too mr wilkinson muttered
he was asleep before any of us

  but captain ben went on as though he
had not heard them well i kinder won-
dered why they should all go off to sleep
like that but pretty soon that hummin
sound grew louder and crept into my head
-the same as gas does when some dentist
feller goes to yank yer tooth i tried to
fight it missy but it werent possible
pretty soon before i realized it i slipped
off into a dream

 a dream what kind of a dream
thats what i want to find out when you
woke up you all said that you had had
such horrible dreams

 the three men exchanged covert


famous fantastic mysteries

glances captain ben rose and knocked the
ashes out of his pipe you ask your pop
missy he said hes a whole lot better
at tellin things than me

  mr wilkinson frowned i dont re-
member anything about it he muttered
not a thing but i think ill go up and
ask masters where we are he said we
might sight fire island light before the
moon rose

  ill go with yer sir said captain ben
hobbling after his employer it takes
the young fellers to remember them dreams
right mr jay i reckon can tell about
hisn like it was a story outer one of them
books youre always readin missy
what was your dream jay elizabeth
asked after the two elder men bad gone
the young mans eyes avoided hers

  i cant tell you bessie he said
that dream was too much a part of my-
self to share it with another there come
such dreams in a mans life-dreams dis-
torted and terrible which one must keep
always in the dark closet of ones mind
women should be satisfied with realities-
a mans dreams must always be his own
i suppose youre right but it must

have been horrible dreams which drove you
all out of the cave without the treasure
they were horrible dreams bessie-at
least mine was jay paused and stroked
his chin meditatively but it cured me
bessie

  cured you the girl asked in surprise
what did it cure you of

  it cured me of that wild craving for
adventure which used to drag me from
place to place as a kitten drags a mouse
this time ive absorbed enough excite-
ment for the rest of my life youll find
that when i get my feet on dry ground ill
turn out to be the most thoroughly do-
mesticated husband in the world

  ill be so glad of that elizabeth said
earnestly if that happens i will never
ask you about your dream if that happens
i shall know that i have really conquered
the whimpus

  there was a moments silence and then
from the bow of the adventurer came a
hail which brought them to their feet it
was captain ben shouting through mas-
terss speaking-trumpet

  land ho the old man cried in a shrill
falsetto land ho missy

and so now karpen sat in tha
death chamber while the gas
fumes swirled around him

around the great table in that impregnable room were gathered the ambassa-
dors of the four magnificoes of the world-and with them unseen sat the

envoy of an even greater one

 by robert neal leath

 afterwards the newspapers
screamed that john albertson
x a president of consolidated amer-
ican steel accidentally had fallen to his
death from a window of his suite on the
sixth floor of the mark hopkins hotel san
francisco four monstrously important
diplomats swore to it

  i was there karpen was there also it
didnt happen like that probably the
diplomats believed what they said and they
looked at me with amazement afterwards
and called me a liar they said they had
never seen me before okay select the
truth for yourself but im telling it my
way because brenda she of the gardenia

skin and the deeply exciting eyes had
a baby this morning and i fear to watch
that baby grow for it is also the child
of karpen the jew and i wonder how
very long it might live

  i met karpen through silverstein the
third night before christmas eve silver-
stein was violently shivering although
the fog was not particularly cold that
night i let him in and he sat down
shivering holding his hat between his
knees and said have you got a drink
jack

  why yes of course

  i gave him the bottle and he chose a
water glass and drank whisky from it
i thought a slug that size would knock
him cold he shook so badly but it didnt




famous fantastic mysteries

  you read the newspapers silverstein
asked he was state executioner at san
quentin the guy who operated the lethal
gas chamber and id met him in a beer
joint i will meet anybody provided he
is not fighting ugly from drink and til
listen to anybody if he will talk partic-
ularly in beer joints i had known silver-
stein thirteen months

  i do read em i said coldly because
silverstein certainly couldnt have forgot-
ten i was a newspaperman

  he said this morning we tried to
execute karpen and looked at me with
the dark brown eyes of his race almost
starting from his head

  his words had had a shock punch behind
them and id felt it

  tried

  suddenly silverstein let his head fall
forward where his hands could hold it
and he began to sob i tell you he said
with a gasp we tried at ten am on the
dot the lever did not fail you know
how the chamber works i trip this little
lever see and a cyanide egg drops into
sulphuric acid and that makes the gas
but within a few seconds i knew there
was something wrong karpen failed to
squirm he didnt choke nor gasp the
horrible way they do silverstein said
nothing happened whatever and there
the gas was rising round him-

i told silverstein to take more whisky
and when he realized what i was talk-
ing about he did he gulped the whisky
from the water glass and it didnt hit him
it only made him hold on to himself a
little

  silverstein said i watched the indica-
tors i tell you enough gas to kill a
herd of elephants wre blew the chamber
out and karpen smiled we put a white
rat in there with him and dropped another
cyanide egg and the rat ran about frantic
squeaking and went into convulsions and
died but karpen kept on smiling after
twenty minutes they took karpen back
to his cell i-i went to see him there

  abruptly silversteins voice was a hor-

rified whisper i hadnt really looked at
karpen in the death chamber but i looked
at him now and-so help me-i re-
membered him from some time long long
ago i had never seen him during all my
life but i remembered him from some
time long long ago silverstein whispered
they were going to try again at ten
oclock tonight but-and here his voice
rose to an almost uncontrolled screech-
they didnt

  i looked at my clock twelve minutes
past ten pm my reason told me that sil-
verstein could not possibly know whether
the execution had been attempted a second
time or not because you cant cross the
bay from san quentin to san francisco in
anything even close to twelve minutes
karpen i knew was a murderer con-
demned to death for the apparently
unprovoked slaying of an international
banker

  why not i said

  because-i let karpen out silverstein
said i-i remembered karpen the jew
from some time long long ago i tell you
i remembered karpen the jew the man
screamed

  i said excuse me and started out
into the hall where i had a telephone i
figured he was nuts i figured i could shut
the door into the hall and call some help
you never know what a nut might do-
especially a nut who has been earning a
living as an executioner nobody i
thought can let a condemned murderer
out of san quentin except a court or the
california governor

   dont telephone silverstein said dully
its not what you think ive got my right
mind

  i dont know why i believed him i came
back and stood in the middle of my living
room

  why do you come now to me silver-
stein

  because you are my friend he said
the only one i have

  from his manner i guessed there was
something else he was holding something
back
karpen the jew



  what else

  because karpen said your name sil-
verstein strangely replied lifting his head
karpen is waiting outside in the hall can
he come in

well that was something all right
perhaps you know that feeling when
your spine seems suddenly to chill and
the hairs rise on the back of your neck
and between your shoulder blades a con-
demned killer fugitive from a death house
waiting outside in my hall wanting to
come in a killer whom id never seen
in the flesh although i knew his features
quite well from pictures-but who could
have been acquainted with my own name
only through some circumstance unknown
to me can he come in

  has he got a gun i said

  why no no of course not silver-
stein said and queerly added i think he
does not need a gun

  i did i needed a gun and i had one
i got it out of my desk and put it in
my right coat pocket i said open the
door

  silverstein obeyed and karpen the jew
came in

  he was wearing an old dark suit that
needed pressing he was tall well over
six feet he was gaunt with wide shoul-
ders and long arms and the slightest trace
of a stoop although he held his head erect
his head was entirely bald no single hair
was on it his skin was very dark and his
face was wide across the cheek bones and
rather flat as though his blood had been
peasants blood some time long ago

  he looked in the vigorous middle of
life although i could not then nor did
i ever determine his precise age but
despite all the extraordinary qualities of
his appearance i thought most striking of
all was the extraordinary deep sadness in
his eyes

  there were a couple of severe wrinkles
down his cheeks a couple more across his
forehead but he had a complete absence
of small wrinkles i thought without being
able to put my finger on my reason that

he looked somehow unlike any other man
id ever seen he took the poorest chair
and sat down clasping his knobby hands
together on his lap

  would you like a drink i said
whisky

  please he said

  what else could you say what else
could you do for a man who had just
skipped a date with death-save offer him
a drink i havent much time i said
i wanted to get out of there im taking
a plane for new york

  karpen said you dont mean wash-
ington

  i stared at him

  no i very carefully had not meant
nor said washington but id been lying
washington was correct i had a tip on
the strangest story any newspaperman
could hope to get i had the address of
a washington house-a palace really i
probably wouldnt be able to get inside
that house but merely to try was worth
a hop across a whole continent

  dont bother karpen softly said
then he added in a swift monotonous
tone as though parroting from memory
youve got a tip jack murphy on the
strangest story that could ever come a
newspapermans way

  he wasnt reading my mind nobody
can read your mind my reason told me
but-i strangely questioned-can nobody
i felt sweat coming out of my skin
how do you know that

  karpen smiled

  dont bother he repeated their
plans have been changed i need some
money lets take a walk

  my brain was whirling like an off-cen-
tered top

  whose plans i demanded savagely

karpen put one big hand out palm
upward and ticked the names off
with his fingers

  the plans of five men john albertson
prince taguchi bahkmeteff callieri stur-
mer they wont meet in washington
taguchi was delayed


famous fantastic mysteries

  i said taguchi arrived here yesterday
morning on the president cleveland he
started east immediately

  no taguchis brother arrived using
the name of the prince for purposes of
dissimulation prince taguchi is coming
on the asama marti and the asama maru
survived a slight collision with a barge in
tokio harborf nevertheless the ship was
delayed sixty hours

  ill check that i said and stood up
the other four men are coming west
to meet taguchi using a special train
they left washington yesterday morning
not by plane in the air you must keep
moving forward to keep on living truly
important men may invest in the air but
they themselves travel on the surface of
the ground and the sea the four will
meet taguchi in the mark hopkins hotel
on christmas eve

  ill check that special train too i
said

  silverstein had no idea what it was
all about but he said with strained con-
viction you will find karpen is right
on my way to the telephone i looked
in a mirror my face was blotched whit-
ish karpen the jew within the realm of
normal possibility could not conceivably
have known about that scheduled wash-
ington conference in addition to myself
only a very few other persons in the world
were supposed to know one was a woman

  john albertson in secret sometimes
went haywire and blew his top off with
drink he drank with his mistress-a
blond and strange and generous girl id
loved some years ago during college
never mind her name shes still around
maybe some day she will get on long-
distance again and send me another tip
because she still has some affection for
me and understands ive got to move up
in this newspaper racket and i cant do
it without a lot of very special informa-
tion she wasnt brenda brenda you re-
member is handsomely dark

  yes the office said it was true that
the asama maru had sustained a minor
collision in tokio harbor the boat would

reach san francisco christmas eve the
office did not of course possess the pas-
senger list of the ship even had the office
had it the list wouldnt have done any
good checking karpens statement about
the special train took more time more
than an hour-and a big telephone bill
i called our washington staff man and he
called me back

  theres nothing but a rumor he said
a special train probably did pull out of
here you may be right you named four
guys not one of them can be located in
washington any place he ought to be

  thanks i said

  i returned to my living room karpen
looked up

  lets go out and walk around he
suggested again

i went with him i was-temporarily
as usual-managing editor of the
clarion but the shop didnt expect me
back till the shop saw me coming my
tip had been too important and id de-
cided to run it down myself but some-
thing must have gone screwy with my
reflexes and reactions that night its the
only way i can figure it now

  yet at the time it seemed perfectly
normal that i should go with karpen in-
stead of doing a lot of other things there
was nothing screwy about the working of
my brain i feel sure i realized with per-
fect clarity that karpens freedom was
itself a spectacular yarn which i should
have hopped on with both feet but per-
haps you yourself have had some such
experience-a time when for no reason
you can afterwards adequately isolate
your accustomed manner of acting simply
does not seem important and you act
differently

  well karpen was there when he should
have been in san quentin or dead i
knew he was karpen all right because
id okayed plenty of his pictures for
page one and i should have hopped on
it fast trying to discover how he had
escaped and perhaps myself recapturing
him
karpen the jew



  instead karpen insisted and we went
for a walk silverstein mumbled that he
had to get back to the prison and he
left us moving away hastily with a queer
motion as though his legs were just re-
covering from some sort of paralysis

  there were pinpoints of water hanging
in the night air and filling it-not rain
exactly or san francisco fog but some-
thing between the two round every street
light a nimbus glowed and the occasional
lighted windows in apartment houses and
residential hotels looked cheerful and
warm and secure against the night and
against all the warped things that walk
by night against all dark violence brood-
ing in the strange minds of men

  we came to powell street and turned
into the brighter city and there were late
people upon the sidewalks buttoned and
furred some few desperate homeless men
who wanted fifteen cents each for beds
and who would want it again tomorrow
night and always people with com-
fortable slugs of alcohol inside them going
home and a few drunks a ruddy cop
named percival said hello to me and didnt
look at karpen and strolled on i wanted
to find out why karpen had done the
killing

  why was it really i said why did
you kill franklin

  franklin had been the banker-a
gambling thief who had stolen the sav-
ings the security and food of a hundred
thousand men and women and children
yet had not gone to jail

  i

  a look of surprise wrinkled karpens
face

  he said patiently i didnt franklin
was dead already jack you would have
said he was insane if you could have
seen clearly the inside of his mind but
my word for it was dead franklin had
that peculiar cunning insanity which can
defeat any scientific test  merely exe-
cuted a fiend a mind in a body which
soulless stalked the earth merely exe-
cuted a walking ruthless greed before
it could do any further damage

  i stopped where i was because my
own mind burned suddenly with a group
of words id not brought up from my
memory in many a year vengeance is
mine-saith the lord

  who do you think you are i snarled
frightened god

  no karpen replied softly humbly
only one particular servant of-the
son

  ill see you later i said courage
greater than mine was required here in
panic i told myself but somehow i didnt
flee perhaps because karpen had his
bald hatted head cocked to one side
as though he listened to some directing
clear sweet distant voice i need some
money he was repeating and then
lets turn up here

we left market and walked i
think about two blocks this street
was darker than most standing on our
right was a skinny brick building where
i remembered a speakeasy used to be
and karpen hesitated and again he seemed
to listen

  it ought to be here he said peering
about on the sidewalk we couldnt see
very well but within a few seconds karpen
stooped and rose with a wallet the wallet
was full of money--it had three
one-hundred-dollar bills in it four tens
and seventeen ones

  karpen took the money out as though
he had known all the time he would find
it there he put the money in his pants
and tossed the excellent wallet and the
rest of its contents into the gutter

  what about the guy who lost all that
i said

  he wont be hurt karpen replied
you and i have three nights and two
days to pass how about beer

  i wanted to get away from karpen
the jew more than ever then but the
midnight examiner was on the street and
when we returned to market i bought
a copy and looked at the headlines across
the top and then i could not leave karpen
at all the line of black type screamed


famous fantastic mysteries

 karpen executed in second try

  now i am not a religious man and i
know no more than any other what may
be the awful abilities of the human spirit
nor to what special terrific power one
particular human mind might attain given
time enough for development in our day
men do claim they do not believe any-
thing save those matters which exude evi-
dences of their reality in laboratories-
upon ammeters and in test tubes through
spectroscopes and chemical stains

  yet such a claim is patently smug and
false since that thing which is most com-
pletely real life in its strange inexplicable
arrival and residence and departure can-
not be identified in any such way that
a scientist may say see this is life
this is the mainspring which makes this
body tick

  and all the days of any mans earthly
life are spent in further confusion be-
lieving himself armed with test tubes
millions of him nevertheless swarm the
churches each sunday there to listen to
splendid words splendid meanings which
make no recordings whatever on scientific
instruments

  a girls eyes are only a couple of eyes
two ingenious spheroids of fluid and veins
and muscles set in a skull yet if she
loves you you can see her spirit shining
deep behind her eyes and you recognize
its reality so well that you are willing to
blend with her spirit all that you have
your own life-willing to give into her
keeping your own unprovable spirit which
you do not understand   

 karpen executed in second try

  on its front page the examiner had a
picture too a picture of the man who
even then walked market street at my
left elbow karpens picture the paper
said karpen had been gassed to death
yet here he was walking

  i put a hand out and gripped his arm
hard and it was a real arm all right
the flesh firm and muscular under the
worn cloth of his coat and my reason
was wildly crying out that this entire

happening could not be true yet it was
true it was blackest magic yet there is
no magic upon the face of the earth and
everything has a natural explanation if you
can only find it abruptly i found my
wild reason wondering how much one
man might learn of exotic but scientific
arts such as hypnotism if he had the
time a great deal i thought-if

  so much learning that he might walk
out of a death house leaving the witnesses
to watch an execution and even a burial
which did not really occur

   if

  if he had the time

  if he had centuries of time-of life
centuries to study

but no normal man does live for cen-
turies no-i thought-and then
told myself with a reasonableness i still
do not understand that karpen the jew
was no normal or ordinary man already
tonight he had used up his earthly time
yet here he was alive and walking at my
side

  my heart was wildly pounding and we
came to a beer joint a rather tough place
patronized considerably by sailors there
were girls some of them temporarily with-
out male companions but we didnt do
anything about the girls karpen had a
tormented look his eyes glowed with tor-
ment and he kept his hat on

  i said you dont want beer youve
got to see your wife

  his sigh was almost a groan and he
moved his great shoulders forward

  it will not be considerate he said
cruel but youre right come on

  me i said surprised

  yes you must stay with me three
days karpen said you must stay with
me till the ambassadors of the great ones
have met and you must see what happens
then nobody will believe you but you
must write it down

  well the great ones planned to start
the killing again coldly deliberately as
all wars are started that had been my
monstrous tip telephoned by john albert-
karpen the jew



sons mistress the ambassadors of the
great ones would meet fix a schedule of
dates determine last details of an agree-
ment which doubtless had been in process
of formulation for months write it down
you could bet your living lungs i would
write the story down if i could only get
it

  karpen said machiavelli was quite a
guy

  i was startled i said sure
machiavelli once remarked karpen
said that if a prince a dictator a despot
of any sort felt himself tottering the only
certain way to restore the power of his
despotism was foreign war arouse the
patriotism of stupid men in any unworthy
and needless cause wave the flag and
beat the drums

  a new feeling of even greater strange-
ness surged through me not from
karpens meaning but from the arrange-
ment of his words and i heard my
strained voice asking did you get that
out of a book karpen

  why no he said no   
machiavelli a florentine philosopher
a writer an adviser to potentates-who
had lived in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries a cold-blooded priest of vio-
lence and subjection how would you
living know what such a man had said
unless you did get it from a book or un-
less-my mind cried out-unless that long-
dead man had spoken to you directly-
in person-before he diedi
you knew machiavelli i ridiculously
stammered and then i leaned on our
table and said quickly loudly who are
you karpen

but he didnt reply and i was glad
he didnt because i felt with abrupt
terror that i already and certainly knew
who he was i remembered an age-old
persistent never-explained legend from
human history the tale of how a tor-
mented man once struggled along a
grievous dusty road bearing his cross
and sought to pause and rest a moment
upon the doorstep of a mean hut but was

denied any pause and of how he uttered
a calm and terrible judgment upon the
jewish laborer dwelling there a curse
that the jew also must never rest not
even in death but must wander the liv-
ing earth forever immune from death un-
ki liable

  and a waiter who had been staring came
to our table and said to me you better
go home now buddy when a guy starts
talkin into his beer he better go home

  the waiter didnt look at karpen i
think now he didnt know he was there
couldnt see him at all probably the
waiter thought i was tight but i was
not id had nothing alcoholic in twenty-
four hours except that one half-finished
glass of beer

  we went out and a taxi took us to
an apartment house in taylor street
brenda opened her own door she was
karpens young wife and she spoke not
a word she only moved within the circle
of his arms and i felt acutely embarrassed
so complete was their kiss her great love
for karpen her entire sweet and pas-
sionate and scientifically-unprovable spirit
came up into her eyes as she stepped into
his arms

  it wasnt till many days later when
everything was over that i remembered
she subsequently asked no questions no
explanation of the bewildering fact of
his freedom although obviously she
had been weeping i think now she never
believed karpen the killer had really died
nor would die no matter what was said

  she took us into her rooms and sat
down she folded her small capable femi-
nine hands in her lap and she looked at
karpen as though she could never stop
looking her eyes big and soft and shining
and a little wet and i knew that if
any man can make a girl love him like
that mister hes got something-but par-
ticularly if the girl is like brenda

  she was completely and astonishingly
beautiful skin like gardenia petals as
ive said large long eyes so brown they
were almost black sleek intensely black
soft hair

  but it was the composition of her fea-
tures that made a click in my mind
im nuts about museums give me a
museum and i can wander there a long
time happily and oddly excited by these
collected tangible inheritances from an-
cient peoples who were human the same
as we are human but who thought acted
believed differently who perhaps pos-
sessed strange knowledges which we will
never possess again

  therefore i knew brenda karpen at
once i had seen those features-not pre-
cisely the same ones but the same un-
mistakable type-many times before
carved in stone and copied from death
masks of queens of the nile of assyria
babylon features strong yet delicate the
nose straight the proportions beautifully
classic

  and brendas possession of them might
have been rare among women but it was
certainly not unique look around you
the races are mixed now and confused
but the flawless features of the ancient
queens have never died the girls are
generally syrian jewish armenian-but
you can find them anywhere among mexi-
can indians in france spain russia
park avenue or the slums of boston

  how long has this been going on
i said

  karpen lifted his eyelids and i thought
a spark was there

  how long do you think

  my spine was ice again but i said
two thousand years you will have
many wives waiting for you karpen and
each will be a copy of the others

  he said with a deep sadness i-hope
they do not wait ive instructed brenda
she must-not

  she smiled it was sweet enigmatic
secret the nearest thing to the mona
lisa smile id ever seen what little
time youve had for me karpen will be
always in my heart she said im going
to have a child of yours

  it wont be like me he said the
child will die when his time has come
listen i screamed because now i

felt that i had to know who are you

  he stared at me and replied dully
why merely karpen a jew

i stayed there till christmas eve i
slept on a couch and thought not once
of the office my spirit was filled with a
mounting swelling dread not for brenda
she i discovered immediately was not
rich but she had an income which would
support her and any child in comfort
no matter what happened to karpen him-
self but dread of what he might do when
the ambassadors assembled

  we left brendas apartment only once
during that period and then to visit an
exclusive mens store there karpen out-
fitted himself from head to foot in the
finest evening clothes the place could
supply and insisted that i purchase simi-
lar gear for myself the salesman who
attended to our wants scarcely opened
his mouth his air was one of fascination
and his face was white and troubled as
though he ought to remember karpen but
could not

  and indeed the fact that such a strange
dark man with the build and rugged coun-
tenance of a laborer the bald head and
the wide knobby brow of a wise and an-
cient spirit should require the formal
tails of highest society doubtless was
enough to silence any salesman and if
he failed to lose his troubled look even
when we departed-well i suppose very
few persons would remember and identify
any convict not having known him per-
sonally after newspapers had declared
him officially dead

  just why are we doing this i had
growled when the man left us alone a
moment

  karpen replied slowly with an odd dig-
nity i too shall be an ambassador of a
great one and we must do him honor
we must not appear less well provisioned
-than the others

  afterward when i had written it down
and thought it over it sounded unnatural
stilted a trifle absurd but i wrote it down
the way he said it and that was it i
karpen the jew



too shall be the ambassador of a great
one karpen said

  afraid i was plenty afraid each meal
time food and wine would appear on
brendas table she refused to permit any
contribution from me and karpen of-
fered none and then christmas eve had
arrived and we set forth-tail-coated top-
hatted caped gloved just karpen and
i all day brenda had been very gay
then inexpressibly sad by turn she kissed
karpen goodbye a kiss even more intense
than that first one i had unwillingly wit-
nessed and held him off by his shoulders
looking into his eyes

  you wont be back karpen
miserably he shook his great head i
have-so much to do

  we walked the night was crisp clear
chill the stars shone bright and a slivver
of moon hung in the night sky and we did
not hasten

  karpen asked suddenly how old are
you

  thirty-five you know that

  he nodded he counted back on his
fingers the last one ended in  you
were-

  fourteen

  a boy scout

  yeah i said i sold liberty bonds
going from one office to the next i had
a boy scout uniform i was a runt for
my age  had a lot of badges an eagle
badge and  sold plenty of bonds

ou dont know how it was then
karpen said and his voice was a
sword steel bitterly slashing the next
men never remember never know till
they see new killing themselves a few
of their fellows turn into animals ruth-
less themselves safe slavering with power-
lust the few start the bands the flags
wave the flags blow the trumpets beat
the drums a few start the new men the
next crop who dont remember again into
the killing no youre a new one and
you dont remember nothing of the hush
hospitals where bodies which are only
hunks of living meat still do live in this

day souvenirs of violence which the new
men are not permitted to see nothing
of the dawn and young men whimpering
or savage in mud and filth and vermin
hungry afraid awaiting zero awaiting
the dreadful top tick of a watch then
scrambling up slipping and scrambling in
mud the air screaming and bursting
themselves quiet only the rifles blasting
themselves moving to death to dreadful
torn flesh and shattered bone themselves
become animals when they ought to be
at home safe working loving their lovely
young women children and dogs in front
of a fire music and warmth and peace
and wine and sunlight all gone

  what are you going to do karpen
i muttered urgently your grammar is
punk

  he didnt reply the mark hopkins we
entered an elevator ourselves the only
passengers that trip and karpen said
sixth floor

the boy stopped the car in front of
a blank wall you cant go there sir
he said you must have made a mistake
karpens eyes seemed to glow his chin
was a rock no mistake he said

  the frightened boy let us out at the
sixth floor the corridors contained per-
haps two dozen men of assorted nationali-
ties well-dressed but tough and hard-
eyed men for all that secret police i
thought

  to my astonishment we walked directly
through the swarming guards and not one
let his glance stop on us not one at-
tempted to block us we might have been
invisible i-think we were

  karpen took a key from one of his
pockets and opened a door  followed
him through one room empty even of
rugs and furniture and into a second
the second room was long big at a long
table the conference of the ambassadors
was already in session

  karpen and i selected two chairs against
the nearest wall and sat down nobody
turned a head nobody in fact seemed
even to be aware of our presence till
karpen acted hours later


famous fantastic mysteries

  right now john albertson was speak-
ing later the others spoke sweated bar-
gained approached exhaustion and refused
it spoke again i think my mouth soon
must have dropped open and stayed that
way because afterward i needed a lot
of water

  bahkmeteff was there representative of
the new dictator of the union of socialist
soviet republics callieri was there from
italy prince taguchi from japan
sturmer a tall german with a monocle a
horse face and utterly blank blue eyes
each man acting not for his people but
for his master

  there was no single dictator in the
united states only a dictating group an
oligarchy given continued peace the
united states eventually might overwhelm
its oligarchy and become truly demo-
cratic therefore john albertson was there
also representing not the president nor
the people of the united states but him-
self and his group-cunning men who un-
derstood the waving of flags and the beat-
ing of drums for profit and personal
power

  they used english in the cultured and
conversational tones of gentlemen so it
wasnt their tones that dropped my mouth
open it was the things they said their
terrible calm meanings

of course i had known that no
modern major conflict ever occurs
unprecedented by definite agreements be-
tween all powers which may be affected
later any conflict may get out of hand
but its beginning is always a matter of
premeditation and not of passion

 yet i had never watched the ma-
chinery mesh the ambassadors of the
great abhor newspapermen whom they
cannot control yet there i was beside
karpen the jew and the ambassadors in
cultured voices were calmly and cunningly
trading in violence in the lands the
wealth the human lives and blood of other
nations they calmly estimated how many
of their own men would be slaughtered
upon the various fronts of attack

  the presence of bahkmeteff of course
had amazed me most callieri and taguchi
and sturmer-fanatic fascists in the next
world war the fascists must inevitably
fight all the rest of the world but mainly
the communists as they fought so long and
horribly in spain and yet here in this
hotel room these fascist leaders were mak-
ing parley with the enemy

  for peace

  i must have been quite unsophisticated
that night to have felt even that one
tingling thrill of hope

  because these men had assembled not
to avoid blood and death but to cause
them and agree upon the details of their
manufacture

  as you know gentlemen bahkmeteff
said suavely war to the russian dic-
tator is an immediate necessity lately
he reminded them handwriting had ap-
peared upon the wall lately the russian
people had demanded that no more food-
stuffs be exported from the soviet union
a demand which had risen after two dec-
ades of cruel animal-like labor raising
tremendous crops only to watch those
crops dumped into foreign world markets
at ruinous prices in exchange for machinery
which the russians might use but cer-
tainly could not eat a demand so ugly
that wisely it had been granted at least
for the present but war would lift the
minds of the russians off their bellies
-and only war

  mussolini and hitler too were totter-
ing the ethiopian burlesque was past
and italy long ago had seized that luck-
less african land for its oil since war-
ships burn oil and there is no oil under
italy and czechoslovakia was hitlers
but he needed flames round the earth be-
fore he moved to regain germanys lost
and more distant colonies

  and japan was invading all the mar-
kets of the world with manufactured goods
and underselling all competitors but going
bankrupt doing it and now particularly
needful of further war to keep her people
whipped up to the proper frenzy of
obedience
karpen the jew



  and in america all the business men
were desperate from taxes and the insane
spending of the government but america
still had no dictator yet john albertson
thought that war might create a dictator-
ship and in any event war would bring
monstrous profits to the steel industry

  sturmer and john albertson callieri
and bahkmeteff agreed prince taguchi
mentioned a date when japanese fishing
boats would attempt to blow up the u s
pacific fleet and block the panama
canal and japanese warships would shell
manila and alaska the germans were
interested sturmer said primarily in
france belgium and southern africa
but would attack russia as a matter of
form not really concentrating any force
there

  oh the ambassadors personally and
john albertson were safe enough in their
planning not one of them not one of
the dictators for whom the ambassadors
spoke ever would see an actual firing
line they were as impersonal as though
they were playing chess war-is always
impersonal to those who start it it be-
comes personal only to those hundreds
of thousands of younger men who get
the bullets in their guts and then john
albertson was speaking again

the bands and the flags were ready
he said geniuses of publicity-ready
also nothing would be simpler to trained
propagandists using an oligarchic press to
orators and politicians than hurling the
united states into war-on either side

  karpen bent toward me and his face
was stiff

  you have heard he said we look
now upon one man who is already dead
all here are drunk with power with am-
bition but only john albertson has al-
ready died a greed-torn dead man who
must sell bullets and armor plate

  fascinated  watched karpen rise from
his chair fascinated i saw the startled
bewildered faces of the diplomats turn
to karpen as though wondering how in
the name of highest heaven any man save

themselves could be here in this room-
a room now guarded by secret police and
secret strongarm men from each of their
separate nations

  i watched karpen slowly stalk to john
albertson and i saw karpens great hands
deliberately close round albertsons throat
while i myself and the other four men
in the room stared in stunned horror

  there was a small stifled scream from
albertson president of consolidated
american steel then he was off his chair
his legs wriggling and attempting to brace
themselves his hands viciously and des-
perately clawing at those other great
hands which had his throat john albert-
son was moving across the thick carpet
toward a window and when karpen the
jew had brought him there karpen de-
liberately withdrew one strangling hand
and got the window open

  then he looked down upon albertson
sadly and-i thought-compassionately
with the deliberation of an automaton
karpen lifted john albertson high held
him squirming and screaming thus a short
moment and flung him into space

  albertsons screams diminished and
then abruptly sickeningly ceased

  karpen turned and faced the ambassa-
dors his rugged face was gray now

  he spoke in a voice more cultured
tremendously more gentle than any of
theirs had been he said gentlemen i
give you a promise each of you is power-
ful not so powerful as the great dic-
tators whom you represent but still each
of you wields colossal influence in his
own land i promise you that if the wars
occur which you have agreed upon tonight
each of you shall die in ways far more
horrible than the way you have seen john
albertson die  say to you ye shall not
kill-and in your own bodies yourselves
remain secure take my message also to
your masters should this war occur to
each great dictator i also shall find my
way and  shall come karpen said
to killi he turned and left without haste

  i went out following karpen and that
was the way it had happened if the am-


famous fantastic mysteries

bassadors afterward called albertsons
plunge merely a tragic accident-well per-
haps they really do not remember what
they saw karpen do and say at least not
in their conscious minds but each of
those four ambassadors i notice has re-
tired now to a private and sedentary life

  and as karpen reached the street the
paved hill-top where the mark hopkins
sits it didnt even occur to me to warn
him that for this latest crime he now must
surely die for i understood he would
never die so long as men lived upon the
earth a lethal gas chamber probably
that had been his last forlorn hope of
death   

the street throbbed with excitement
of course and police and an ambu-
lance were here but we walked unim-
peded past the police past the broken
mashed object that had been john albert-
son and went down into the town freshly
dressed quiet people were going into the
churches on that christmas sunday morn-
ing and there were tollings of bells

  i can do so little karpen said
youve done plenty lately i said
one man-in all the world why dont
the others help

  some of them do

  there was nothing mystic nothing su-
pernormal in the sardonic glance which
this living jew turned on me then nor
in his hard practical words hear me
karpen said this is the united states
of america ive been here many times
you have a constitution the highest law
of the land adopt an amendment say
that each member of the congress who
votes for any war or who fails to vote
against it shall upon formal declaration
of such war automatically lose his office
that immediately he shall be compelled re-

gardless of age or physical competence to
become an infantry private ineligible for 
promotion ineligible for furlough even if
wounded and assigned to front line com-
bat until dead or until the war ends
send also to the front any president who
signs a declaration of war adopt that
one simple basic law challenge other na-
tions into providing likewise for their own
leaders and then said karpen the jew
you wouldnt have very many more
wars

  he halted without warning and added
but the nations will not be permitted
to do it the great rulers are never the
ones who fight

  he was looking at me but his eyes
became strangely opaque perhaps he
wasnt seeing me any longer his head
cocked to one side and again i had that
curious impression that he was listening
to some voice which i myself could not
hear within a few seconds however
his pupils cleared hastily and with a
queer formality he shook my hand mur-
mured i have so little time said good-
bye and was gone

  so little time all eternity he had-yet
karpen the jew was pressed and had to
hurry and brendas son was born today
-karpens son-and although karpen
had assured her the child would not be
like himself i cannot help wondering i
pray it will not because karpen the
last i saw of him was walking away in
christmas sunlight while bells tolled re-
peating that another child a christ had
been born walking down a city sidewalk
through the moving crowds in their fine
new clothing stalking the world himself
one symbol of his entire deep and peace-
ful and homeless race one lonely man
accursed forever to the choking task of
all mankinds salvation
 the girl
     in the golden atom

by ray cummings

the super-magnifier showed that there was a whole world within the chemists
ring and he meant to find out what went on in it

chapter i

a universe in an atom

f i hen you mean to say there is no
       such thing as the smallest particle
       of matter asked the very young

man

  you can put it that way if you like
the chemist replied in other words what
l believe is that things can be infinitely
small just as well as they can be infinitely
large astronomers tell us of the immen-
sity of space i have tried to imagine space
as finite it is impossible how can you
conceive the edge of space something
must be beyond-something or nothing
and even that would be more space
the chemist resumed smiling a little
now if it seems probable that there is no
limit to the immensity of space why should
we make its smallness finite how can you
say that the atom cannot be divided as a
matter of fact it already has been the
most powerful microscope will show you
realms of smallness to which you can pene-
trate no other way multiply that power a
thousand times or ten thousand times and
who shall say what you will see

  the chemist paused and looked at the
intent little group around him

  he was a youngish man with large fea-
tures and horn-rimmed glasses his rough
english-cut clothes hanging loosely over his
broad spare frame the banker drained
his glass and rang for the waiter

  very interesting he remarked

  dont be silly george said the big
business man just because you dont
understand doesnt mean there is no sense
to it

  the doctor crossed under the light and
took an easier chair you intimated you
had discovered something unusual in these
realms of the infinitely small he sug-
gested sinking back luxuriously will you
tell us about it

  yes if you like said the chemist
turning from one to the other a nod of
assent followed his glance as each settled
himself more comfortably

  well gentlemen when you say i have
discovered something unusual in another
world-in the world of the infinitely small
-you are right in a way i have seen
something and lost it you wont believe
me probably he glanced at the banker
an instant but that is not important i
am going to tell you what happened

  the big business man filled up the
glasses all around and the chemist re-
sumed 

  to begin with i succeeded some time
ago in having a microscope made which
was more powerful than any known to
science even up to the present moment

  i can recall now my feelings when it
arrived i was about to see into another
world to behold what no man had ever
looked on before what would i see what
new realms was i first of all our human
race to enter with furiously beating
heart i sat down before the huge instru-
ment and adjusted the eye-piece




famous fantastic mysteries

  then i glanced around for some object
to examine on my finger i had a ring my
mothers wedding ring and i decided to use
that i have it here he took a plain gold
band from his little finger and laid it on
the table

  you will see a slight mark on the out-
side that is the place into which i
looked

  his friends crowded around the table
and examined a scratch on one side of the
band

  what did you see asked the very
young man eagerly

  gentlemen resumed the chemist
what i saw staggered even my own imagi-
nation with trembling hands i put the
ring in place looking directly down into
that scratch for a moment i saw nothing
i was like a person coming suddenly out of
the sunlight into a darkened room i knew
there was something visible in my view but
my eyes did not seem able to receive the
impressions i realize now they were not
yet adjusted to the new form of light
gradually as i looked objects of definite
shape began to emerge from the blackness

  gentlemen i want to make clear to you
now-as clear as i can-the peculiar aspect
of everything that i saw under this micro-
scope i seemed to be inside an immense
cave one side near at hand i could now
make out quite clearly the walls were
extraordinarily rough and indented with a
peculiar phosphorescent light on the projec-
tions and blackness in the hollows i say
phosphorescent light for that is the nearest
word i can find to describe it-a curious
radiation quite different from the reflected
light to which we are accustomed

  i said that the hollows inside of the
cave were blackness but not blackness-
the absence of light-as we know it it was
a blackness that seemed also to radiate
light if you can imagine such a condition
a blackness that seemed not empty but
merely withholding its contents just beyond
my vision

  except for a dim suggestion of roof over
the cave and its floor i could distinguish
nothing after a moment this floor became

clearer it seemed to be-well perhaps i
might call it black marble-smooth glossy
yet somewhat translucent in the fore-
ground the floor was apparently liquid in
no way did it differ in appearance from the
solid part except that its surface seemed to
be in motion

  another curious thing was the outlines
of all the shapes in view i noticed that no
outline held steady when i looked at it
directly it seemed to quiver you see
something like it when looking at an object
through water-only of course there was
no distortion it was also like looking at
something with the radiation of heat be-
tween

  of the back and other side of the cave
i could see nothing except in one place
where a narrow effulgence of light drifted
out into the immensity of the distance
behind

  i do not know how long i sat looking
at this scene it may have been several
hours although i was obviously in a cave
i never felt shut in-never got the impres-
sion of being in a narrow confined space

  on the contrary after a time i seemed
to feel the vast immensity of the blackness
before me i think perhaps it may have
been that path of light stretching out into
the distance as i looked it seemed like the
reversed tail of a comet or the dim glow
of the milky way and penetrating to
equally remote realms of space

  perhaps i fell asleep or at least there
was an interval of time during which i was
so absorbed in my own thoughts i was
hardly conscious of the scene before me

  then i became aware of a dim shape
in the foreground-a shape merged with
the outlines surrounding it and as i
looked it gradually assumed form and i
saw it was the figure of a young girl sit-
ting beside the liquid pool except for the
same waviness of outline and phosphores-
cent glow she had quite the normal aspect
of a human being of our own world she
was beautiful according to our own stand-
ards of beauty her long braided hair a
glowing black her face delicate of feature
and winsome in expression her lips were
the girl in the golden atom



a deep red although i felt rather than saw
the color

  she was dressed only in a short tunic
of a substance i might describe as gray
opaque glass and the pearly whiteness of
her skin gleamed with iridescence

  she seemed to be singing although i
heard no sound once she bent over the
pool and plunged her hand into it laugh-
ing gaily

  gentlemen i cannot make you appre-
ciate my emotions when all at once i re-
memfiered i was looking through a micro-
scope i had forgotten entirely my situa-
tion absorbed in the scene before me and
then all at once a great realization came
upon me-the realization that everything i
saw was inside that ring i was unnerved
for the moment at the importance of my
discovery

  when i looked again after the few
moments my eye took to become accus-
tomed to the new form of light the scene
showed itself as before except that the girl
had gone

  for over a week each night at the same
time i watched that cave the girl came
always and sat by the pool as i had first
seen her once she danced with the wild
grace of a wood nymph whirling in and out
of the shadows and falling at last in a little
heap beside the pool

  it was on the tenth night after i had
first seen her that the accident happened
i had been watching i remember an un-
usually long time before she appeared glid-
ing out of the shadows she seemed in a
different mood pensive and sad as she
bent down over the pool staring into it
intently suddenly there was a tremendous
cracking sound sharp as an explosion and
i was thrown backward upon the floor

  when i recovered consciousness-i
must have struck my head on something-
i found the microscope in ruins upon
examination t saw that its larger lens had
exploded-flown into fragments scattered
around the room why i was not killed i
do not understand the ring i picked up
from the floor it was unharmed and un-
changed

  can i make you understand how i felt
at this loss because of the great expense
i knew i could never rebuild my lens-for
many years at any rate and then gentle-
men came the most terrible feeling of all
i knew at last that the scientific achieve-
ment i had made and lost counted for little
with me it was the girl i realized then
that the only being i ever could care for
was living out her life with her world and
indeed her whole universe in an atom of
that ring

  the chemist stopped talking and looked
from one to the other of the tense faces of
his companions

  its almost too big an idea to grasp
murmured the doctor

  what caused the explosion asked the
very young man

  i do not know the chemist ad-
dressed his reply to the doctor as the most
understanding of the group i can appre-
ciate though that through that lens i was
magnifying tremendously those peculiar
light-radiations that i have described i
believe the molecules of the lens were shat-
tered by them-i had exposed it longer to
them that evening than any of the others

  the doctor nodded his comprehension of
this theory

  impressed in spite of himself the banker
took another drink and leaned forward in
his chair then you really think that there
is a girl now inside the gold of that ring
he asked

  he didnt say that necessarily inter-
rupted the big business man

  yes he did

  as a matter of fact i do believe that to
be the case said the chemist earnestly
i believe that every particle of matter in
our universe contains within it anequally
complex and complete a universe which to
its inhabitants seem as large as ours i
think also that the whole realm of our
interplanetary space our solar system and
all the remote stars of the heavens are
contained within the atom of some other
universe as gigantic to us as we are to the
universe in that ring

  gosh said the very young man


famous fantastic mysteries

  it doesnt make one feel very important
in the scheme of things does it remarked
the big business man dryly

  the chemist smiled the existence of
no individual no nation no world nor any
one universe is of the least importance
then it would be possible said the
doctor for this gigantic universe that
contains us in one of its atoms to be itself
contained within the atom of another uni-
verse still more gigantic and so on
that is my theory said the chemist
and in each of the atoms of the rocks
of that cave there may be other worlds
proportionately minute

  i can see no reason to doubt it

well there is no proof anyway said
the banker we might as well believe it
i intend to get proof said the chemist
do you believe all these innumerable
universes both larger and smaller than
ours are inhabited asked the doctor

  i should think probably most of them
are the existence of life i believe is as
fundamental as the existence of matter
without life

  how do you suppose that girl got in
there asked the very young man com-
ing out of a brown study

  what puzzled me resumed the chem-
ist ignoring the question is why the girl
should so resemble our own race i have
thought about it a good deal and i have
reached the conclusion that the inhabitants
of any universe in the next smaller or larger
plane to ours probably resemble us fairly
closely that ring you see is in the same
-shall we say-environment as ourselves
the same forces control it that control us
now if the ring had been created on mars
for instance i believe that the universes
within its atoms would be inhabited by
beings like the martians-if mars has any
inhabitants of course in planes beyond
those next to ours either smaller or larger
changes would probably occur becoming
greater as you go in or out from our own
universe

  good lord it makes one dizzy to think
of it said the big business man

  i wish i knew how that girl got in

there said the very young man looking
at the ring

  she probably didnt retorted the doc-
tor very likely she was created there the
same as you were here

  i think that is probably so said the
chemist and yet sometimes i am not at
all sure she was very human the very
young man looked at him sympathetically

  how are you going to prove your
theories asked the banker in his most
irritatingly practical way

  the chemist picked up the ring and put
it on his finger gentlemen he said i
have tried to tell you facts not theories
what i saw through that ultramicroscope
was not an unproven theory but a fact
my theories you have brought out by your
questions

  you are quite right said the doctor
but you did mention yourself that you
hoped to provide proof

  the chemist hesitated a moment then
made his decision i will tell you the rest
he said

  after the destruction of the microscope
i was quite at a loss how to proceed i
thought about the problem for many weeks
finally i decided to work along another
altogether different line-a theory about
which i am surprised you have not already
questioned me

  he paused but no one spoke

  i am hardly ready with proof to-night
he resumed after a moment will you all
take dinner with me here at the club one
week from to-night he read affirmation
in the glance of each

  good thats settled he said rising
at seven then

  but what was the theory you expected
us to question you about asked the very
young man

  the chemist leaned on the back of his
chair

  the only solution i could see to the
problem he said slowly was to find
some way of making myself sufficiently
small to be able to enter that other uni-
verse i have found such a way and one
week from to-night gentlemen with your
the girl in the golden atom



assistance i am going to enter the surface
of that ring at the point where it is
scratched 

chapter ii

into the ring

the cigars were lighted and dinner over
before the doctor broached the sub-
ject uppermost in the minds of every mem-
ber of the party

  a toast gentlemen he said raising his
glass to the greatest research chemist in
the world may he be successful in his ad-
venture to-night

the chemist bowed his acknowledgment

  you have not heard me yet he said
smiling

  but we want to said the very young
man impulsively

  and you shall he settled himself more
comfortably in his chair gentlemen i am
going to tell you first as simply as possi-
ble just what i have done in the past two
years you must draw your own conclusions
from the evidence i give you

  you will remember that j told you last
week of my dilemma after the destruction
of the microscope its loss and the impossi-
bility of replacing it led me into still bolder
plans than merely the visual examination of
this minute world i reasoned as i have
told you that because of its physical prox-
imity its similar environment so to speak
this outer world should be capable of sup-
porting life identical with our own

  i saw then but one obstacle standing
between me and this other world-the dis-
crepancy of size the distance separating
our world from this other is infinitely great
or infinitely small according to the view-
point in my present size it is only a few
feet from here to the ring on that plate
but to an inhabitant of that other world
we are as remote as the faintest stars of the
heavens diminished a thousand times

  he paused a moment signing the waiter
to leave theoom

  this reduction of bodily size great as
it is involves no deeper principle than does

a light contraction of tissue except that it
must be carried further the problem
then was to find a chemical sufficiently
unharmful to life that would so act upon
the body cells as to cause a reduction in
bulk without changing their shape i had
to secure a uniform and also a proportion-
ate rate of contraction of each cell in order
not to have the body shape altered

  after a comparatively small amount of
research work i encountered an apparently
insurmountable obstacle as you know
gentlemen our living human bodies are
held together by the power of the central
intelligence we call the mind every instant
during your lifetime your subconscious
mind is commanding and directing the in-
dividual life of each cell that makes up
your body at death this power is with-
drawn each cell is thrown under its own
individual command and dissolution of the
body takes place

  i found therefore that i could not act
upon the cells separately so long as they
were under control of the mind on the
other hand i could not withdraw this
power of the subconscious mind without
causing death

  i progressed no further than this for
several months then came the solution
i reasoned that after death the body does
not immediately disintegrate far more
time elapses than i expected to need for
the cell-contraction i devoted my time
then to finding a chemical that would tem-
porarily withhold during the period of
cell-contraction the power of the subcon-
scious mind just as the power of the
conscious mind is withheld by hypnotism

  i am not going to weary you by trying
to lead you through the maze of chemical
experiments into which i plunged

  i worked on rabbits almost exclusively
after a few weeks i succeeded in com-
pletely suspending animation in one of
them for several hours there was no life
apparently existing during that period it
was not a trance or coma but the complete
simulation of death no harmful results
followed the revivifying of the animal the
contraction of the cells was far more dif-


famous fantastic mysteries

ficult to accomplish i finished my last ex-
periment less than six months ago

  then you really have been able to
make an animal infinitely small asked
the big business man

  the chemist smiled i sent four rabbits
into the unknown last week he said

  as i was planning to project myself
into this unknown universe and to reach
the exact size proportionate to it i soon
realized such a result could not be obtained
were i in an unconscious state only by
successive doses of the drug or its retard-
ant about which i will tell you later could
i hope to reach the proper size another
necessity is that i place myself on the
exact spot on that ring where i wish to
enter and to climb down among its atoms
when i have become sufficiently small to
do so obviously this would be impossible
to one not possessing all his faculties and
physical strength

  and did you solve that problem too
asked the banker id like to see it done
he added

  the chemist produced two small paper
packages from his wallet these drugs are
the result of my research he said one
of them causes contraction and the other
expansion by an exact reversal of the
process taken together they produce no
effect and a lesser amount of one retards
the action of the other he opened the
papers showing two small vials i have
made them as you see in the form of tiny
pills each containing a minute quantity of
the drug it is by taking them successively
in unequal amounts that i expect to reach
the desired size

  theres one point that you do not men-
tion said the doctor those vials and
their contents will have to change size as
you do how are you going to manage
that

  by experimentation i have found an-
swered the chemist that any object held
in close physical contact with the living
body being contracted is contracted itself
at an equal rate i believe that my clothes
will be affected also these vials i will
carry strapped under my armpits

  suppose you should die or be killed
would the contraction cease asked the
doctor

  yes almost immediately replied the
chemist apparently though i am acting
through the subconscious mind while its
power is held in abeyance when this power
is permanently withdrawn by death the
drug no longer affects the individual cells
the contraction or expansion ceases almost
at once

  is it your intention to take this stuff
yourself to-night asked the big business
man

  if you will give me your help i think
so yes i have made all arrangements
the club has given us this room in absolute
privacy for forty-eight hours your meals
will be served here when you want them
and i am going to ask you gentlemen to
take turns watching and guarding the ring
during that time will you do it

  i should say we would cried the doc-
tor and the others nodded assent

  it is because i wanted you to be con-
vinced of my entire sincerity that i have
taken you so thoroughly into my confi-
dence are those doors locked the very
young man locked them

  thank you said the chemist starting
to disrobe in a moment he stood before
them attired in a woolen bathing-suit of
pure white over his shoulders was strapped
tightly a narrow leather harness supporting
two silken pockets one under each armpit
into each of these he placed one of the
vials first laying four pills from one of
them upon the table

  at this point the banker rose from his
chair and selected another in the further
corner of the room he sank into it a
crumpled heap and wiped the beads of per-
spiration from his face with a shaking hand

  i have every expectation said the
chemist that this suit and harness will
contract in size uniformly with me if the
harness should not then i shall have to
hold the vials in my hand-

  on the table directly under the light
he spread a large silk handkrchief upon
which he placed the ring he then pro-
the girl in the golden atom



duced a teaspoon which he handed to the
doctor

  please listen carefully he said for
perhaps the whole success of my adventure
and my life itself may depend upon your
actions during the next few minutes you
will realize of course that when i am still
large enough to be visible to you i shall be
so small that my voice may be inaudible
therefore i want you to know now just
what to expect

  when i am something under a foot
high i shall step upon that handkerchief
where you will see my white suit plainly
against its black surface when i become
less than an inch high i shall run over to
the ring and stand beside it when i have
diminished to about a quarter of an inch i
shall climb upon it and as i get smaller
will follow its surface until i come to the
scratch

  i want you to watch me very closely
i may miscalculate the time and wait until
i am too small to climb upon the ring or
i may fall off in either case you will place
that spoon beside me and i will climb into
it you will then do your best to help me
get on the ring is all this quite clear

  the doctor nodded assent

  very well watch me as long as i re-
main visible if i have an accident i shall
take the other drug and endeavor to return
to you at once this you must expect at
any moment during the next forty-eight
hours under all circumstances if i am
alive i shall return at the expiration of that
time

  and gentlemen let me caution you
most solemnly do not allow that ring to be
touched until that length of time has ex-
pired can i depend on you

  yes they answered breathlessly

  after i have taken the pills the chem-
ist continued i shall not speak unless it
is absolutely necessary i do not know
what my sensations will be and i want to
follow them as closely as possible he
then turned out all the lights in the room
with the exception of the center electrolier
that shone down directly on the handker-
chief and ring

  the chemist looked about him good-
by gentlemen he said shaking hands all
around wish me luck and without hesi-
tation he placed the four pills in his mouth
and washed them down with a swallow of
water

  silence fell on the group as the chemist
seated himself and covered his face with his
hands for perhaps two minutes the tense-
ness of the silence was unbroken save by
the heavy breathing of the banker as he lay
huddled in his chair

  oh look hes really growing smaller
whispered the big business man in a hor-
rified tone to the doctor the chemist
raised his head and smiled at them then
he stood up steadying himself against a
chair he was less than four feet high
steadily he grew smaller before their horri-
fied eyes once he made as if to speak and
the doctor knelt down beside him its
all right good-by he said in a tiny voice

  then he stepped upon the handkerchief
the doctor knelt on the floor beside it
the wooden spoon ready in his hand while
the others except the banker stood behind
him the figure of the chemist standing
motionless near the edge of the handker-
chief seemed now like a little white wooden
toy hardly more than an inch in height

  waving his hand and smiling he sudden-
ly started to walk and then ran swiftly over
to the ring by the time he reached it
somewhat out of breath he was little more
than twice as high as the width of its band
without pausing he leaped up and sat
astraddle leaning over and holding to it
tightly with his hands in another moment
he was on his feet on the upper edge of the
ring walking carefully along its circum-
ference toward the scratch

  the big business man touched the doc-
tor on the shoulder and tried to smile
hes making it he whispered as if in
answer the little figure turned and waved
its arms they could just distinguish its
white outline against the gold surface un-
derneath

  i dont see him said the very young
man in a scared voice

  hes right near the scratch answered


famous fantastic mysteries

the doctor bending closer then after a
moment hes gone he rose to his feet
good lord why havent we a micro-
scope he added

  i never thought of that said the big
business man we could have watched
him for a long time yet

  well hes gone now returned the doc-
tor and there is nothing for us to do but
wait

  i hope he finds that girl sighed the
very young man

chapter iii

after forty-eight hours

the banker snored stertorously from
a davenport in a corner of the room
in an easy-chair near by with his feet on
the table lay the very young man sleep-
ing also

  the doctor and the big business man
sat by the handkerchief

  how long has it been now asked the
latter

  just forty hours answered the doc-
tor and he said that forty-eight hours was
the limit he should come back at about
ten to-night

  i wonder if he will come back ques-
tioned the big business man nervously

  they were silent for a moment and then
he went on youd better try to sleep a
while he said to the doctor youre worn
out ill watch here

  i suppose i should answered the doc-
tor wearily wake up that kid hes sleep-
ing most of the time

  no ill watch repeated the big busi-
ness man you lie down over there
the doctor did so while the other settled
himself more comfortably on a cushion be-
side the handkerchief and prepared for his
lonely watching

  the doctor apparently dropped off to
sleep at once for he did not speak again
the big business man sat staring steadily
at the ring bending nearer to it occasion-
ally every ten or fifteen minutes he looked
at his watch

  perhaps an hour passed in this way
when the very young man suddenly sat up
and yawned havent they come back
yet he asked in a sleepy voice

  the big business man answered in a
much lower tone what do you mean-
they he said

  i dreamed that he brought the girl
back with him said the very young man

  well if he did they have not arrived
answered the big business man youd
better go back to sleep weve got six or
seven hours yet

  the very young man rose and crossed
the room no ill watch a while he said
seating himself on the floor what time
is it

  quarter of three

  he said hed be back by ten to-night
im crazy to see that girl

  the big business man rose and went
over to a dinner-tray standing near the
door lord im hungry i must have for-
gotten to eat to-day he lifted up one
of the silver covers what he saw evidently
encouraged him for he drew up a chair and
began his lunch

  the very young man lighted a cigarette
it will be the tragedy of my life he said
if he never comes back

  the big business man smiled how
about his life he answered but the very
young man had fallen into a reverie and
did not reply

  the big business man finished his lunch
in silence and was just about to light a
cigar when a sharp exclamation brought
him hastily to his feet

  come here quick i see something
the very young man had his face close
to the ring and was trembling violently

  the other pushed him back let me
see where

  there by the scratch hes lying there
i can see him

  the big business man looked and then
hurriedly woke the doctor

  hes come back he said briefly you
can see him there the doctor bent down
over the ring while the others woke up the
banker
the girl in the golden atom



  he doesnt seem to be getting any
bigger said the very young man hes
just lying there maybe hes dead

  what shall we do asked the big busi-
ness man and made as if to pick up the
ring the doctor shoved him away dont
do that he said sharply do you want
to kill him

  hes sitting up cried the very young
man hes all right

  he must have fainted said the doc-
tor probably hes taking more of the
drug now

  hes much larger said the very
young man look at him

  the tiny figure was sitting sidewise on
the ring with its feet hanging over the
outer edge it was growing perceptibly
larger each instant and in a moment it
slipped down off the ring and sank in a
heap on the handkerchief

  good heavens look at him cried the
big business man hes all cut and
scratched 

  the little figure presented a ghastly
sight as it steadily grew larger they could
see and recognize the chemists haggard
face

  look at his feet whispered the big
business man they were horribly cut and
bruised and greatly swollen

  the doctor bent over and whispered
gently what can i do to help you the
chemist shook his head his body lying
prone upon the handkerchief had torn it
apart in growing when he was about
twelve inches in length he raised his head
the doctor bent closer some brandy
please said a wraith of the chemists
voice it was barely audible

  he wants some brandy called the
doctor the very young man looked
hastily around then opened the door and
dashed madly out of the room when he
returned the chemist had grown to nearly
four feet he was sitting on the floor with
his back against the doctors knees

  here cried the very young man
thrusting forth the brandy the chemist
drank a little of it then he sat up evi-
dently somewhat revived

  i seem to have stopped growing he
said lets finish it up now my how
i want to be the right size again he added
fervently

  the doctor helped him extract the vials
from under his arm and the chemist
touched one of the pills to his tongue then
he sank back closing his eyes i think
that should be about enough he mur-
mured

  no one spoke for nearly ten minutes
gradually the chemists body grew the
doctor shifting his position several times
as it became larger it seemed finally to
have stopped growing and was apparently
nearly its former size

  was it all as you expected asked the
banker

  to a great extent yes answered the
chemist but i had better tell you just
what happened the very young man
nodded his eager agreement

  when i took those first four pills be-
gan the chemist in a quiet even tone my
immediate sensation was a sudden reeling
of the senses combined with an extreme
nausea this latter feeling passed after a
moment he paused to light a cigar

  you will remember that i seated my-
self upon the floor and closed my eyes
when i opened them my head had steadied
itself somewhat but i was oppressed by a
curious feeling of drowsiness impossible to
shake off

  my first mental impression was one of
wonderment when i saw you all begin to
increase in size i remember standing up
beside that chair which was then half again
its normal size and you-indicating the
doctor-towered beside me as a giant of
nine or ten feet high

  steadily upward with a curious crawl-
ing motion grew the room and all its con-
tents except for the feeling of sleep that
oppressed me i felt quite my usual self
no change appeared happening to me but
everything else seemed growing to gigantic
and terrifying proportions

  can you imagine a human being a
hundred feet high that is how you looked
to me as i stepped upon that huge expanse


famous fantastic mysteries

of black silk and shouted my last good-by
to you

  over to my left lay the ring apparent-
ly fifteen or twenty feet away i started to
walk toward it but although it grew rap-
idly larger the distance separating me from
it seemed to increase rather than lessen
then i ran and by the time i arrived it
stood higher than my waist-a beautiful
shaggy golden pit

  i jumped upon its rim and clung to it
tightly i could feel it growing beneath me
as i sat after a moment i climbed upon
its top surface and started to walk toward
the point where i knew the scratch to be

  i found myself now as  looked about
walking upon a narrow though ever broad-
ening curved path the ground beneath
my feet appeared to be a rough yellowish
quartz this path grew rougher as i ad-
vanced below the bulging edges of the
path on both sides lay a shining black
plain ridged and indented and with a sun-
like sheen on the higher portions of the
ridges on the one hand this black plain
stretched in an unbroken expanse to the
horizon on the other there appeared a
circular valley enclosed by a shining yellow
wall

  the way had now become extraordi-
narily rough i bore to the left as i ad-
vanced keeping close to the outer edge
the other edge of the path i could not see
i clambered along hastily and after a few
moments was confronted by a row of rocks
and boulders lying directly across my line
of progress i followed their course for
a short distance and finally found a space
through which i could pass

  this transverse ridge was perhaps a
hundred feet deep behind it and extend-
ing in a parallel direction lay a tremendous
valley i knew then i had reached my first
objective

  i sat down upon the brink of the preci-
pice and watched the cavern growing ever
wider and deeper then i realized that i
must begin my descent if ever i was to
reach the bottom for perhaps six hours
i climbed steadily downward it was a
fairly easy descent according to the stature

i was when i reached the bottom i had
descended perhaps twelve thousand feet
during this time

  the latter part of this journey found
me nearing the bottom of the canon ob-
jects around me no longer seemed to in-
crease in size as had been constantly the
case before and i reasoned that probably
my stature was remaining constant

  i noticed too as i advanced a curious
alteration in the form of light around me
the glare from above the sky showed only
as a narrow dull ribbon of blue barely
penetrated to the depths of the canons
floor but all about me there was a soft
radiance seeming to emanate from the
rocks themselves

  i have not told you gentlemen that at
the time i marked the ring i made a deeper
indentation in one portion of the scratch
and focused the microscope upon that
this indentation i now searched for luck-
ily i found it less than half a mile away-
an almost circular pit perhaps five miles
in diameter with shining walls extending
downward into blackness there seemed no
possible way of descending into it

  the sleepy feeling that had formerly
merely oppressed me combined now with
my physical fatigue and the larger dose of
the drug i had taken became almost in-
tolerable i yielded to it for a moment
lying down on a crag near the edge of the
pit i must have become almost immedi-
ately unconscious and remained so for a
considerable time i can remember a hor-
rible sensation of sliding headlong for what
seemed like hours i felt that i was sliding
or falling downward i tried to rouse but
could not then came absolute oblivion

  when i recovered my senses i was
lying partly covered by a mass of smooth
shining pebbles i was bruised and bat-
tered from head to foot-in a far worse
condition than you first saw me when i
returned

  i sat up and looked around beside me
sloped upward at an apparently increasing
angle was a high glossy plane this ex-
tended as far as i could see both to the
right and left and upward into the black-
the girl in the golden atom



ness of the sky overhead it was this plane
that had evidently broken my fail and i
had been sliding down it bringing with me
a considerable mass of rocks and boulders

  the incline down which i had fallen
was composed of some smooth substance
suggesting black marble the floor under-
foot was quite different-more of a metallic
quality with a curious corrugation before
me in the dim distance i could just make
out a tiny range of hills

  i rose after a time and started weakly
to walk toward these hills

  there i found what had evidently once
been a deep forest but which now was al-
most utterly desolated only here and
there were the trees left standing for the
most part they were lying in a crushed and
tangled mass many of them partially em-
bedded in the ground

  i cannot express adequately to you
gentlemen what an evidence of tremen-
dous superhuman power this scene pre-
sented no storm no lightning nor any
attack of the elements could have produced
more than a fraction of the destruction i
saw all around me

  i climbed cautiously upon a fallen
tree-trunk and from this elevation had a
much better view of my surroundings i
appeared to be near one end of the deso-
lated area which extended in a path about
half a mile wide and several miles deep
in front a thousand feet away perhaps
lay the unbroken forest

  descending from the tree-trunk i
walked in this direction reaching the edge
of the woods after possibly an hour of
the most arduous traveling of my whole
journey

  on one of the fallen tree-trunks i found
a sort of vine growing this vine bore a
profusion of small gray berries much like
our huckleberries they proved similar in
taste and i sat down and ate a quantity

  when i reached the edge of the forest
i felt somewhat stronger i had seen up to
this time no sign of animal life whatever
now as i stood silent i could hear around
me all the multitudinous tiny voices of the
woods insect life stirred underfoot and

in the trees above an occasional bird flitted
to and fro

 perhaps i am giving you a picture of
our own world i do not mean to do so
you must remember that above me there
was no sky just blackness and yet so
much light illuminated the scene that i
could not believe it was other than what we
would call daytime objects in the forest
were as well lighted-better probably than
they would be under similar circumstances
in our own world

  the trees were of huge size compared
to my present stature straight upstanding
trunks with no branches until very near
the top they were bluish-gray in color
and many of them well covered with the
berry-vine i have mentioned the leaves
overhead seemed to be blue-in fact the
predominating color of all the vegetation
was blue just as in our world it is green
the ground was covered with dead leaves
mold and a sort of a gray moss fungus
of a similar color appeared but of this i
did not eat

  i had penetrated perhaps two miles
into the forest when i came unexpectedly
to the bank of a broad smooth-flowing
river its silver surface seeming to radiate
waves of the characteristic phosphorescent
light i found it cold pure-tasting water
and i drank long and deeply then i re-
member lying down upon the mossy bank
and in a moment utterly worn out i
again fell asleep

chapter iv

lylda

t was awakened by the feel of soft
 hands upon my head and face with
a start i sat up abruptly i rubbed my
eyes confusedly for a moment not knowing
where i was when i collected my wits
i found myself staring into the face of a
girl who was kneeling on the ground before
me i recognized her at once-she was the
girl of the microscope

  to say i was startled would be to put
it mildly but i read no fear in her expres-
sion only wonderment at my springing so


famous fantastic mysteries

suddenly into life she was dressed very
much as i had seen her before her fragile
beauty was the same and at this closer
view infinitely more appealing but i was
puzzled to account for her older more
mature look she seemed to have aged
several years since the last evening i had
seen her through the microscope yet un-
deniably it was the same girl

  for some moments we sat looking at
each other in wonderment then she smiled
and held out her hand palm up speaking
a few words as she did so her voice was
soft and musical and the words of a pe-
culiar quality that we generally describe
as liquid for want of a better term what
she said was wholly unintelligible but
whether the words were strange or the in-
tonation different from anything i had ever
heard  could not determine

  the gap separating us however was
very much less than you would imagine
strangely enough though it was not i who
learned to speak her tongue but she who
mastered mine

 the very young man sighed con-
tentedly

  we became quite friendly after this
greeting resumed the chemist and it
was apparent from her manner that she
had already conceived her own idea of who
and what i was

  for some time we sat and tried to com-
municate with each other my words
seemed almost as unintelligible to her as
hers to me except that occasionally she
would divine my meaning clapping her
hands in childish delight i made out that
she lived at a considerable distance and
that her name was lylda finally she
pulled me by the hand and led me away
with a proprietary air that amused and 
must admit pleased me tremendously

  we had progressed through the woods
in this way hardly more than a few hun-
dred yards when suddenly i found that she
was taking me into the mouth of a cave or
passageway sloping downward at an angle
of perhaps twenty degrees i noticed now
more graphically than ever before a truth
that had been gradually forcing itself upon

me darkness was impossible in this new
world we were now shut in between nar-
row walls of crystalline rock with a roof
hardly more than fifty feet above

  no artificial light of any kind was in
evidence yet the scene was lighted quite
brightly this i have explained was
caused by the phosphorescent radiation
that apparently emanated from every par-
ticle of mineral matter in this universe

  as we advanced many other tunnels
crossed the one we were traveling and
now occasionally we passed other people
the men dressed similarly to lylda but
wearing their hair chopped off just above
the shoulder line

  later i found that the men were gen-
erally about five and a half feet in stature
lean muscular and with a grayer harder
look to their skin than the iridescent
quality that characterized the women

  they were fine-looking chaps these we
encountered all of them stared curiously
at me and several times we were held up
by chattering groups the intense white-
ness of my skin for it looked in this light
the color of chalk seemed to both awe and
amuse them but they treated me with
great deference and respect which i after-
ward learned was because of lylda herself
and also what she told them about me

  at several of the intersections of the
tunnels there were wide open spaces one
of these we now approached it was a
vast amphitheater so broad its opposite
wall was invisible and it seemed crowded
with people at the side on a rocky niche
in the wall a speaker harangued the crowd

  we skirted the edge of this crowd and
plunged into another passageway sloping
downward still more steeply i was so
much interested in the strange scenes open-
ing before me that i remarked little of the
distance we traveled nor did i question
lylda but seldom i was absorbed in the
complete similarity between this and my
own world in its general characteristics
and yet its complete strangeness in details

  i felt not the slightest fear indeed
the sincerity and kindliness of these people
seemed absolutely genuine and the friend-
the girl in the golden atom



ly naive manner of my little guide put me
wholly at my ease toward me ly idas
manner was one of childish delight at a
new-found possession toward those of her
own people with whom we talked i found
she preserved a dignity they profoundly
respected

  we had hardly more than entered this
last tunnel when i heard the sound of
drums and a weird sort of piping music
followed by shouts and cheers figures
from behind us scurried past hastening to-
ward the sound lyldas clasp on my hand
tightened and she pulled me forward
eagerly as we advanced the crowd became
denser pushing and shoving us about and
paying little attention to me

  in close contact with these people i
soon found i was stronger than they and
for a time i had no difficulty in shoving
them aside and opening a path for us they
took my rough handling all in good part
in fact never have i met a more even
tempered good-natured people than these

  after a time the crowd became so
dense we could advance no further at this
lylda signed me to bear to the side as
we approached the wall of the cavern she
suddenly clasped her hands high over her
head and shouted something in a clear
commanding voice instantly the crowd fell
back and in a moment i found myself
being pulled up a narrow flight of stone
steps in the wall and out upon a level space
some twenty feet above the heads of the
people

  several dignitaries occupied this plat-
form lylda greeted them quietly and they
made place for us beside the parapet i
could see now that we were at the inter-
section of a transverse passageway much
broader than the one we had been travers-
ing and now i received the greatest sur-
prise i had had in this new world for
down this latter tunnel was passing a broad
line of men who obviously were soldiers

  the uniformly straight lines they held
the glint of light on the spears they car-
ried upright before them the weird but
rhythmic music that passed at intervals
with which they kept step and above all

  the cheering enthusiasm of the crowd all
seemed like an echo of my own great world
above

  this martial ardor and what it implied
came as a distinct shock all i had seen
before showed the gentle kindliness of a
people whose life seemed far removed from
the struggle for existence to which our race
is subjected i had come gradually to feel
that this new world at least had attained
the golden age of security and that fear
hate and wrong-doing had long since
passed away or had never been born

  yet here before my very eyes made
wholesome by the fires of patriotism
stalked the grim god of war knowing
nothing yet of the motives that inspired
these people i could feel no enthusiasm
but only disillusionment at this discovery
of the omnipotence of strife

  for some time i must have stood in
silence lylda too seemed to divine my
thoughts for she did not applaud but
pensively watched the cheering throng be-
low all at once with an impulsively ap-
pealing movement she pulled me down
toward her and pressed her pretty cheek
to mine it seemed almost as if she was
asking me to help

  the line of marching men seemed now
to have passed and the crowd surged over
into the open space and began to disperse
as the men upon the platform with os
prepared to leave lylda led me over to
one of them he was nearly as tall as i
and dressed in the characteristic tunic that
seemed universally worn by both sexes
the upper part of his body was hung with
beads and across his chest was a thin
slightly convex stone plate

  after a few wotds of explanation from
lylda he laid his hands on my shoulders
near the base of the neck smiling with his
words of greeting then he held one hand
before me palm up as lylda had done
and i laid mine in it which seemed the
correct thing to do

  i repeated this performance with two
others who joined us and then lylda
pulled me away we descended the steps
and turned into the broader tunnel finding


famous fantastic mysteries

  near at hand a sort of sleigh which lylda
signed me to enter it was constructed evi-
dently of wood with a pile of leaves or
similar dead vegetation for cushions it
was balanced upon a single runner of pol-
ished stone about two feet broad with a
narrow shorter outrider on each side

  harnessed to the shaft were two ani-
mals more resembling our reindeers than
anything else except that they were gray
in color and had no horns an attendant
greeted lylda respectfully as we ap-
proached and mounted a seat in front of
us when we were comfortably settled

  we drove in this curious vehicle for
over an hour the floor of the tunnel was
quite smooth and we glided down its in-
cline with little effort and at a good rate
our driver preserved the balance of the
sleigh by shifting his body from side to
side so that only at rare intervals did the
side-runners touch the ground

  finally we emerged into the open and
i found myself viewing a scene of almost
normal earthly aspect we were near the
shore of a smooth shining lake at the
side a broad stretch of rolling country
dotted here and there with trees was visi-
ble near at hand on the lake shore i
saw a collection of houses most of them
low and flat with one much larger on a
promontory near the lake

  overhead arched a gray-blue cloudless
sky faintly star-studded and reflected in
the lake before me  saw that familiar
gleaming trail of star-dust hanging like a
huge straightened rainbow overhead and
ending at my feet

chapter v

tiie world in the ring

the chemist paused and relighted his
cigar perhaps you have some ques-
tions he suggested

  the doctor shifted in his chair

  did you have any theory at this time
-he wanted to know-about the physical
conformation of this world what i mean
is when you came out of this tunnel were
you on the inside or the outside of the
world

  was it the same sky you saw overhead
when you were in the forest asked the
big business man

  no it was what he saw in the micro-
scope wasnt it said the very young
man

  one at a time gentlemen laughed the
chemist no i had no particular theory
at this time-i had too many other things
to think of but t do remember noticing
one thing which gave me the clue to a
fairly complete understanding of this uni-
verse from it i formed a definite explana-
tion which i found was the belief held by
the people themselves

  what was that asked the very young
man

  i noticed as i stood looking over this
broad expanse of country before me one
vital thing that made it different from any
similar scene i had ever beheld if you
will stop and think a moment gentlemen
you will realize that in our world here the
horizon is caused by a curvature of the
earth below the straight line of vision we
are on a convex surface but as i gazed
over this landscape and even with no ap-
preciable light from the sky i could see a
distance of several miles i saw at once
that quite the reverse was true i seemed
to be standing in the center of a vast shal-
low bowl the ground curved upward into
the distance there was no distinct horizon
line only the gradual fading into shadow
of the visual landscape i was standing
obviously on a concave surface on the in-
side not the outside of the world

  the situation as i now understand it
was this according to the smallest stature

i	reached and calling my height at that
time roughly six feet i had descended into
the ring at the time i met lylda several
thousand miles at least by the way where
is the ring

  here it is said the very young man
handing it to him the chemist replaced
it on his finger its pretty important to
me now he said smiling

  you bet agreed the very young man

  you can readily understand how i de-
scended such a distance if you consider the
the girl in the golden atom



comparative immensity of my stature dur-
ing the first few hours i was in the ring
it is my understanding that this country
through which i passed is a barren waste-
merely the atoms of what we call gold

  beyond that i entered the hitherto un-
explored regions within the atom the
country at that point where i found the
forest i was told later is habitable for
several hundred miles around it on all
sides lies a desert across which no one has
ever penetrated

  this surface is the outside of the
oroid world for so they call their earth
at this point the shell between the outer
and inner surfaces is only a few miles in
thickness the two surfaces do not parallel
each other so that in descending these tun-
nels we turned hardly more than an eighth
of a complete circle

  at the city of arite where lylda first
took me and where i had my first view of
the inner surface the curvature is slightly
greater than that of our own earth al-
though as i have said in the opposite
direction

  and the space within this curvature-
the heavens you have mentioned-how
great do you estimate it to be asked the
doctor

  based on the curvature at arite it
would be about six thousand miles in
diameter

  has this entire inner surface been ex-
plored asked the big business man

  no ouly a small portion the oroids
are not an adventurous people there are
only two nations less than twelve million
people all together on a surface nearly as
extensive as our own

  how about those stars suggested the
very young man

  i believe they comprise a complete uni-
verse similar to our own solar system
there is a central sun-star around which
many of the others revolve you must
understand though that these other worlds
are infinitely tiny compared to the oroids
and if inhabited support beings nearly as
much smaller than the oroids as they are
smaller than you

  great caesar ejaculated the banker
dont lets go into that any deeper
tell us more about lylda prompted
the very young man

  you are insatiatable on that point
laughed the chemist well when we left
the sleigh lylda took me directly into the
city of arite i found it an orderly collec-
tion of low houses seemingly built of uni-
formly cut highly polished gray blocks as
we passed through the streets some of
which were paved with similar blocks i
was reminded of nothing so much as the old
jingles of spotless town everything was
immaculately inordinately clean indeed
the whole city seemed built of some curious
form of opaque glass newly scrubbed and
polished

  children crowded from the doorways
as we advanced but lylda dispersed them
with a gentle though firm command as
we approached the sort of castle i have
mentioned the reason for lyldas authori-
tative manner dawned upon me she was
i soon learned daughter of one of the most
learned men of the nation and was-hand-
maiden do you call it-to the queen

  so it was a monarchy interrupted the
big business man i should never have
thought that

  lylda called their leader a king in
reality he was the president chosen by
the people for a period of about what we
would term twenty years i learned some-
thing about this republic during my stay
but not as much as i would have liked

  the food was not greatly different from
our own although i found not a single
article i could identify it consisted prin-
cipally of vegetables and fruits

  lylda visited me at intervals and i
learned i was awaiting an audience with
the king during these days she made rapid
progress with my language-so rapid that
i shortly gave up the idea of mastering
hers

  and now with the growing intimacy
between us and our ability to communicate
more readily i learned the simple tragic
story of her race-new details of course
but the old old tale of might against right


famous fantastic mysteries

and the tragedy of a trusting kindly peo-
ple blindly thinking others as just as
themselves

  for thousands of years since the mas-
ter life-giver had come from one of the
stars to populate the world the oroid
nation had dwelt in peace and security
these people cared nothing for adventure
no restless thirst for knowledge led them
to explore deeply the limitless land sur-
rounding them even from the earliest
times no struggle for existence no doctrine
of the survival of the fittest hung over
them as with us no wild animals harassed
them no savages menaced them a fertile
boundless land a perfect climate nurtured
them tenderly

  under such conditions they developed
only the softer gentler qualities of nature
many laws among them were unnecessary
for life was so simple so pleasant to live
and the attainment of all the commonly
accepted standards of wealth so easy that
the incentive to wrongdoing was almost
non-existent

  strangely enough and fortunately too
no individuals rose among them with the
desire for power those in command were
respected and loved as true workers for the
people and they accepted their authority
in the same spirit with which it was given
indolence in its highest sense the wonder-
ful art of doing nothing gracefully played
the greatest part in their life

  then after centuries of ease and
peaceful security came the awakening
almost without warning another nation had
come out of the unknown to attack them

  with the hurt feeling that comes to a
child unjustly treated they all but suc-
cumbed to this first onslaught the ab-
duction of numbers of their women for
such seemed the principal purpose of the
invaders aroused them sufficiently to repel
this first crude attack their manhood
challenged their anger as a nation awak-
ened for the first time they sprang as one
man into the horror we call war

  with the defeat of the malites came
another period of ease and security they
had learned no lesson but went their in-

dolent way playing through life like the
kindly children they were during this last
period some intercourse between them and
the malites took place the latter people
whose origin was probably nearly opposite
them on the inner surface had by degrees
pushed their frontiers closer and closer to
the oroids trade between the two was
carried on to some extent but the char-
acter of the malites their instinctive desire
for power for its own sake their considera-
tion for themselves as superior beings
caused them to be distrusted and feared
by their more simple-minded companion
nation

  you can almost guess the rest gentle-
men lylda told me little about the
malites but the loathing disgust of her
manner her hesitancy even to bring her-
self to mention them spoke more elo-
quently than words

  four years ago as they measure time
came the second attack and now in a
huge arc only a few hundred miles from
arite hung the opposing armies

  the chemist paused thats the con-
dition i found gentlemen he said not
a strikingly original or unfamiliar situation
was it

 by jove remarked the doctor
thoughtfully what a curious thing that
the environment of our earth should so
effect that world inside the ring it does
make you stop and think doesnt it to re-
alize how those infinitesimal creatures are
actuated now by the identical motives that
inspire us

  yet it does seem very reasonable i
should say the big business man put in

 t t was the morning of my third day in

  a the castle began the chemist again
that i was taken by lylda before the
king we found him seated alone in a
little anteroom overlooking a large court-
yard which we could see was crowded
with an expectant waiting throng i must
explain to you now that i was considered
by lylda somewhat in the light of a mes-
siah come to save her nation from the
destruction that threatened it
the girl in the golden atom



  she believed me a supernatural being
which indeed if you come to think of it
gentlemen is exactly what i was i tried
to tell her something of myself and the
world i had come from but the difficulties
of language and her smiling insistence and
faith in her own conception of me soon
caused me to desist thereafter i let her
have her own way and did not attempt
any explanation again for some time

  for several weeks before lylda found
me sleeping by the rivers edge she had
made almost a daily pilgrimage to that vi-
cinity a maidenly premonition a feeling
that had first come to her several years be-
fore told her of my coming and her
fathers knowledge and scientific beliefs
had led her to the outer surface of the
world as the direction in which to look a
curious circumstance gentlemen lies in the
tact that lylda clearly remembered the oc-
casion when this first premonition came to
her and in the telling she described
graphically the scene in the cave where i
saw her through the microscope the
chemist paused an instant and then re-
sumed

  when we entered the presence of the
king he greeted me quietly and made me
sit by his side while lylda knelt on the
floor at our feet the king impressed me
as a man about fifty years of age he was
smooth-shaven with black wavy hair
reaching his shoulders he was dressed in
the usual tunic the upper part of his body
covered by a quite similar garment orna-
mented with a variety of metal objects
his feet were protected with a sort of buck-
skin at his side hung a crude-looking
metal spear

  the conversation that followed my en-
trance lasted perhaps fifteen minutes
lylda interpreted for us as well as she
could though i must confess we were all
three at times completely at a loss but
lyldas bright intelligent little face and
the resourcefulness of her gestures always
managed somehow to convey her meaning
the charm and grace of her manner all
during the talk her winsomeness and the
almost spiritual kindness and tenderness

that characterized her made me feel that
she embodied all those qualities with which
we of this earth idealize our own woman-
hood

  i found myself falling steadily under
the spell of her beauty until-well gen-
tlemen its childish for me to enlarge upon
this side of my adventure you know but-
lylda means everything to me now and
im going back for her just as soon as i
possibly can

  bully for you cried the very young
man why didnt you bring her with
you this time

  let him tell it his own way remon-
strated the doctor the very young man
subsided with a sigh

  during our talk resumed the chem-
ist i learned from the king that lylda
had promised him my assistance in over-
coming the enemies that threatened his
country he smilingly told me that our
charming little interpreter had assured him
i would be able to do this lyldas blush-
ing face as she conveyed this meaning to
me was so thoroughly captivating that be-
fore i knew it and quite without meaning
to i pulled her up toward me and kissed
her

  the king was more surprised by far
than lylda at this extraordinary behavior
obviously neither of them had understood
what a kiss meant although lylda by her
manner evidently comprehended pretty
thoroughly

  i told them then as simply as possible
to enable lylda to get my meaning that i
could and would gladly aid in their war
i explained then that i had the power to
change my stature and could make myself
grow very large or very small in a short
space of time

  this as lylda evidently told it to him
seemed quite beyond the kings under-
standing he comprehended finally or at
least he agreed to believe my statement

  this led to the consideration of prac-
tical questions of how i was to proceed in
their war i had not considered any details
before but now they appeared of the ut-
most simplicity all i had to do was to


famous fantastic mysteries

make myself a hundred or two hundred
feet high walk out to the battle lines and
scatter the opposing army like a set of
small boys playthings

  then like three children we plunged
into a discussion of exactly how i was to
perform these wonders the king laughing
heartily as we pictured the attack on my
tiny enemies

  he then asked me how i expected to
accomplish this change of size and i very
briefly told him of our larger world and
the manner in which i had come from it
into his then i showed the drugs that i
still carried carefully strapped to me this
seemed definitely to convince the king of
my sincerity he rose abruptly to his feet
and strode through a doorway onto a small
balcony overlooking the courtyard below

  as he stepped out into the view of the
people a great cheer arose he waited
quietly for them to stop and then raised
his hand and began speaking lylda and
i stood hand in hand in the shadow of the
doorway out of sight of the crowd but
with it and the entire courtyard plainly in
our view

  it was a quadrangular enclosure
formed by the four sides of the palace per-
haps three hundred feet across packed
solidly now with people of both sexes the
gleaming whiteness of the upper parts of
their bodies and their upturned faces mak-
ing a striking picture

  for perhaps ten minutes the king
spoke steadily save when he was inter-
rupted by applause then he stopped
abruptly and turning pulled lylda and me
out upon the balcony the enthusiasm of
the crowd doubled at our appearance i
was pushed forward to the balcony rail
where i bowed to the cheering throng

  just after i left the kings balcony i
met lyldas father he was a kindly faced
old gentleman and took a great interest in
me and my story he it was who told me
about the physical conformation of his
world and he seemed to comprehend my
explanation of mine

  that night it rained-a heavy torren-
tial downpour such as we have in the

tropics lylda and i had been talking for
some time and i must confess i had been
making love to her ardently  broached
now the principal object of my entrance
into her world and with an eloquence i
did not believe i possessed i pictured the
wonders of our own great earth above beg-
ging her to come back with me and live out
her life with mine

  much of what i said she probably did
not understand but the main facts were
intelligible without question she listened
quietly when i had finished and waited
for her decision she reached slowly out
and clutched my shoulders awkwardly
making as if to kiss me in an instant she
was in my arms with a low happy little
cry

ftlhe clattering fall of rain brought

  x us to ourselves rising to her feet
lylda pulled me over to the window-
opening and together we stood and looked
out into the night the scene before us
was beautiful with a weirdness almost im-
possible to describe it was as bright as
i had ever seen this world for even though
heavy clouds hung overhead the light from
the stars was never more than a negligible
quantity

  we were facing the lake-a shining
expanse of silver radiation its surface shift-
ing and crawling as though a great undu-
lating blanket of silver mist lay upon it
and coming down to meet it from the sky
were innumerable lines of silver-a vast
curtain of silver cords that broke apart
into great strings of pearls when i followed
their downward course

  and then as i turned to lylda i was
struck with the extraordinary weirdness of
her beauty as never before the reflected
light from the rain had something the qual-
ity of our moonlight shining on lyldas
body it tremendously enhanced the iri-
descence of her skin and her face up-
turned to mine bore an expression of
radiant happiness and peace such as i had
never seen before in a womans counte-
nance

  the chemist paused his voice dying
the girl in the golden atom



away into silence as he sat lost in thought
then he pulled himself together with a
start it was a sight gentlemen the
memory of which i shall cherish all my
life

  the next day was that set for my en-
trance into the war lylda and i had
talked nearly all night and had decided
that she was to return with me to my
world by morning the rain had stopped
and we sat together in the window-opening
silenced with the thrill of the wonderful
new joy that had come into our hearts

  the country before us under the
cloudless starry sky stretched gray-blue
and beautiful into the quivering obscurity
of the distance at our feet lay the city
just awakening into life beyond over the
rolling meadows and fields wound the road
that led out to the battle-front and coming
back over it now we could see an endless
line of vehicles these as they passed
through the street beneath our window i
found were loaded with soldiers wounded
and dying i shuddered at the sight of
one cart in particular and lylda pressed
closer to me pleading with her eyes for
my help for her stricken people

  my exit from the castle was made
quite a ceremony a band of music and
a guard of several hundred soldiers ushered
me forth walking beside the king with
lylda a few paces behind as we passed
through the streets of the city heading for
the open country beyond we were cheered
continually by the people who thronged the
streets and crowded upon the housetops to
watch us pass

  outside arite i was taken perhaps a
mile where a wide stretch of country gave
me the necessary space for my growth
we were standing upon a slight hill below
which in a vast semicircle fully a hundred
thousand people were watching

  and now for the first time fear over-
took me i realized my situation-saw
myself in a detached sort of way-a stran-
ger in this extraordinary world and only
the power of my drug to raise me out of
it this drug you must remember i had
not as yet taken

  i glanced around the king stood be-
fore me quietly waiting my pleasure then
i turned to lylda one glance at her
proud happy little face and my fear left
me as suddenly as it had come i took her
in my arms and kissed her there before
that multitude then i set her down and
signified to the king i was ready

  i took a minute quantity of one of the
drugs and as  had done before sat down
with my eyes covered my sensations
were fairly similar to those i have already
described when i looked up after a mo-
ment i found the landscape dwindling to
tiny proportions in quite as astonishing a
way as it had grown before the king and
lylda stood now hardly above my ankles

  a great cry arose from the people-a
cry wherein horror fear and applause
seemed equally mixed i looked down and
saw thousands of them running away in
terror

  still smaller grew everything within
my vision and then after a moment the
landscape seemed at rest i kneeled now
upon the ground carefully to avoid tread-
ing on any of the people around me i lo-
cated lylda and the king after a moment
tiny little creatures less than an inch in
height i was then i estimated from their
view-point about four hundred feet tall

  i put my hand flat upon the ground
near lylda and after a moment she climbed
into it two soldiers lifting her up the side
of my thumb as it lay upon the ground
in the hollow of my palm she lay quite
securely and very carefully i raised her
up toward my face then seeing that she
was frightened i set her down again

  at my feet hardly more than a few
steps away lay the tiny city of arite and
the lake i could see all around the latter
now and could make out clearly a line of
hills on the other side off to the left the
road wound up out of sight in the distance
as far as i could see a line of soldiers was
passing out along this road-marching four
abreast with carts at intervals loaded evi-
dently with supplies only occasionally
now vehicles passed in the other direc-
tion can i make it plain to you gentlemen


famous fantastic mysteries

my sensations in changing stature i felt
at first as though i were tremendously
high in the air looking down as from a
balloon upon the familiar territory beneath
me that feeling passed after a few mo-
ments and i found that my point of view
had changed i no longer felt that i was
looking down from a balloon but felt as a
normal person feels and again i con-
ceived myself but six feet tall standing
above a dainty little toy world it is all in
the view-point of course and never dur-
ing all my changes was i for more than a
moment able to feel of a different stature
than i am at this present instant it was
always everything else that changed

  according to the directions i had re-
ceived from the king i started now to fol-
low the course of the road i found it dif-
ficult walking for the country was dotted
with houses trees and cultivated fields
and each footstep was a separate problem

  i progiessed in this manner perhaps
two miles covering what the day before i
would have called about a hundred and
thirty or forty miles the country became
wilder as i advanced and now was in
places crowded with separate collections of
troops

  i have not mentioned the commotion
i made in this walk over the country my
coming must have been told wildly by
couriers the night before to soldiers and
peasantry alike or the sight of me would
have caused utter demoralization as it
was i must have been terrifying to a tre-
mendous degree i think the careful way
in which i picked my course stepping in
the open as much as possible helped re-
assure the people behind me whenever
i turned they seemed rather more curious
than fearful and once or twice when i
stopped for a few moments thej ap-
proached my feet closely one athletic
young soldier caught the loose end of the
string of one of my buskins as it hung
over my instep close to the ground and
pulled himself up hand over hand amid
the enthusiastic cheers of his comrades

  i had walked nearly another mile when
almost in front of me and perhaps a hun-

dred yards away i saw a remarkable sight
that i did not at first understand the
country here wras crossed by a winding river
running in a general way at right angles to
my line of progress at the right near at
hand and on the nearer bank of the river
lay a little city perhaps half the size of
arite with its back up against a hill

  what first attracted my attention was
that from a dark patch across the river
which seemed to be the woods pebbles ap-
peared to pop up at intervals traversing a
little arc perhaps as high as my knees
and falling into the city i watched for a
moment and then i understood there
was a seige in progress and the catapults
of the malites were bombarding the city
with rocks

  i went up a few steps closer and the
pebbles stopped coming i stood now be-
side the city and as i bent over it i could
see by the battered houses the havoc the
bombardment had caused inert little fig-
ures lay in the streets and i bent lower
and inserted my thumb and forefinger be-
tween a row of houses and picked one up
it was the budy of a woman partly
mashed i set it down again hastily

  then as i stood up i felt a sting on
my leg a pebble had hit me on the shin
and dropped at my feet i picked it up
it was the size of a small walnut-a huge
boulder six feet or more in diameter it
would have been in lyldas eyes at the
thought of her i was struck with a sudden
fit of anger i flung the pebble violently
down into the wooded patch and leaped
over the river in one bound landing square-
ly on both feet in the woods it was like
jumping into a patch of ferns

   stamped about me for a moment
until a large part of the woods was crushed
down then i bent over and poked around
with my finger underneath the tangled
wreckage of tiny tree trunks lay numbers
of the malites i must have trodden upon
a thousand or more as one would stamp
upon insects

  the sight sickened me at first for after
all i could not look upon them as other
than men even though they were only the
the girl in the golden atom



length of my thumb-nail i walked a few
steps forward and in all directions i could
see swarms of the little creatures running
then the memory of my coming departure
from this world with lylda and my
promise to the king to rid his land once for
all from these people made me feel again
that they like vermin were to be de-
stroyed

  without looking directly down i spent
the next two hours stamping over this en-
tire vicinity then i ran two or three
miles directly toward the country of the
malites and returning i stamped along the
course of the river for a mile or so in both
directions then i walked back to arite
again picking my way carefully among
crowds of the oroids who now feared me
so little that i had difficulty in moving
without stepping upon them

  when i had regained my former size
which needed two successive doses of the
drug i found myself surrounded by a
crowd of the oroids pushing and shoving
each other in an effort to get closer to me
the news of my success over their enemy
had been divined by them evidently lord
knows it must have been obvious enough
what  was going to do when they saw me
stride away a being four hundred feet tall

  their enthusiasm and thankfulness now
were so mixed with awe and solemn wor-
ship of me as a divine being that when
i advanced toward arite they opened a
path immediately the king accompanied
by lylda met me at the edge of the city
the latter threw herself into my arms at
once crying with relief to find me the
proper size once more

  i need not go into details of the cere-
monies of rejoicing that took place this
afternoon these people seemed little given
to pomp and public demonstration the
king made a speech from his balcony
telling them all i had done and the city
was given over to festivities and prepara-
tions to receive the returning soldiers

  the chemist pushed his chair back from
the table and moistened his dry lips with
a swallow of water i tell you gentle-
men he continued i felt pretty happy

that day its a wonderful feeling to find
yourself the savior of a nation

  at that the doctor jumped to his feet
overturning his chair and striking the ta-
ble a blow with his fist that made the
glasses dance

  you know he fairly shouted thats
just what you can be here to us

  the banker looked startled while the
very young man pulled the chemist by
the coat in his eagerness to be heard a
few of these pills he said in a voice that
quivered with excitement when you are
standing in a country and you can walk
over to the next country and kick the
houses apart with the toe of your boot
silence fell in the group as they stared
at each other awed by the possibilities that
opened up before them

chapter vi

i must go back

the tremendous plan for the salvation
of their own suffering world through
the chemists discovery occupied the five
friends for some time then laying aside
this subject that now had become of the
most vital importance to them all the
chemist resumed his narrative

  my last evening in the world of the
ring i spent with lylda discussing our
future and making plans for the journey
i must tell you now gentlemen that never
for a moment during my stay in arite was
i free from an awful dread of this same re-
turn trip i tried to conceive what it would
be like and the more i thought about it
the more hazardous it seemed

  you must realize when i was growing
smaller coming in i was able to climb
down or fall or slide down into the spaces
as they opened up going back i could
only imagine the world as closing in upon
me crushing me to death unless i could
find a larger space immediately above into
which i could climb

  and as i talked with lylda about this
and tried to make her understand what i
hardly understood myself i gradually was
brought to realize the full gravity of the


famous fantastic mysteries

clanger confronting us if only i had made
the trip out once before i could have ven-
tured it with her but as i looked at her
fragile little body to expose it to the ter-
rible possibilities of such a journey was un-
thinkable

  there was another question too that
troubled me i had been gone from you
nearly a week and you were only to wait
for me two days i believed firmly that i
was living at a faster rate and that prob-
ably my time with you had not expired
but i did not know and suppose when
i had come out on to the surface of the
ring one of you had had it on his finger
walking along the street no i did not
want lylda with me in that event

  and so i told her-made her under-
stand-that she must stay behind and that
i would come back to her she did not
protest she said nothing-just looked up
into my face with wide staring eyes and a
little quiver of her lips then she clutched
my hand and fell into a low sobbing cry

  i held her in my arms for a few mo-
ments so little so delicate so human in
her sorrow and yet almost superhuman in
her radiant beauty soon she stopped cry-
ing and smiled up at me bravely

  next morning i left lylda took me
through the tunnels and back into the
forest by the rivers edge where i had first
met her there we parted i can see now
her pathetic drooping little figure as she
trudged back to the tunnel

  when she had disappeared i sat down
to plan out my journey i resolved now
to reverse as nearly as possible the steps i
had taken coming in acting on this de-
cision i started back to that portion of
the forest where i had trampled it down

  i found the place without difficulty
stopping once on the way to eat a few ber-
ries and some of the food i carried with
me then i took a small amount of one
of the drugs and in a few moments the
forest-trees had dwindled into tiny twigs
beneath my feet

  i started now to find the huge incline
down which i had fallen and when i
reached it after some hours of wandering

i followed its bottom edge to where a pile
of rocks and dirt marked my former land-
ing place the rocks were much larger
than i remembered them and so i knew i
was not so large now as when i was here
before

  remembering the amount of the drug
i had taken coming down i took now
twelve of the pills then in a sudden panic
i hastily took two of the others the re-
sult made my head swim most horribly i
sat or lay down i forget which when i
looked up i saw the hills beyond the river
and forest coming toward me yet
dwindling away beneath my feet as they
approached the incline seemed folding
up upon itself like a telescope as i
watched its upper edge came into view a
curved luminous line against the blackness
above every instant it crawled down
closer more sharply curved and its in-
clined surface grew steeper

  all this time as i stood still the
ground beneath my feet seemed to be mov-
ing it was crawling toward me and fold-
ing up underneath where i was standing
frequently i had to move to avoid rocks
that came at me and passed under my feet
into nothingness

  then all at once i realized that i had
been stepping constantly backward to
avoid the incline wall as it shoved itself
toward me i turned to see what was be-
hind and horror made my flesh creep at
what i saw a black forbidding wall much
like the incline in front entirely encircled
me it was hardly more than half a mile
away and towered four or five thousand
feet overhead

  and as i stared in terror i could see
it closing in the line of its upper edge com-
ing steadily closer and lower i looked
wildly around with an overpowering im-
pulse to run in every direction towered
this rocky wall inexorably swaying in to
crush me

  i think i fainted when i came to
myself the scene had not greatly changed
i was lying at the bottom and against one
wall of a circular pit now abouta thousand
feet in diameter and nearly twice as deep
the girl in the golden atom



the wall all around i could see was almost
perpendicular and it seemed impossible to
ascend its smooth shining sides the ac-
tion of the drug had evidently worn off
for everything was quite still

  my fear had now left me for i re-
membered this circular pit quite well i
walked over to its center and looking
around and up to its top i estimated dis-
tances carefully then i took two more
of the pills

  immediately the familiar sickening
crawling sensation began again as the
walls closed in upon me i kept carefully
in the center of the pit steadily they
crept in now only a few hundred feet
away now only a few paces-and then i
reached out and touched both sides at
once with my hands

  i tell you gentlemen it was a terrify-
ing sensation to stand in that well as it
now seemed and feel its walls closing up
with irresistible force but now the upper
edge was within reach of my fingers i
leaped upward and hung for a moment
then pulled myself up and scrambled out
tumbling in a heap on the ground above
as i recovered myself i looked again at
the hole out of which i had escaped it was
hardly big enough to contain my fist

  i knew now i was at the bottom of
the scratch but how different it looked
from before it seemed this time a long
narrow canon hardly more than sixty feet
across i glanced up and saw the blue sky
overhead flooded with light that i knew
was the space of this room above the ring

  the problem now was quite a different
one than getting out of the pit for i saw
that the scratch was so deep in proportion
to its width that if i let myself get too big
i would be crushed by its walls before i
could jump out it would be necessary
therefore to stay comparatively small and
climb up its side

  i selected what appeared to be an es-
pecially rough section and took a portion
of another of the pills then i started to
climb after an hour the buskins on my
feet were torn to fragments and i was
bruised and battered as you saw me i

see now how i could have made both the
descent into the ring and my journey back
with comparatively little effort but i did
the best i knew at the time

  when the canon was about ten feet in
width and i had been climbing arduously
for several hours i found myself hardly
more than fifteen or twenty feet above
its bottom and i was still almost that
far from the top with the stature i had then
attained i could have climbed the re-
maining distance easily but for the fact
that the wall above had grown too smooth
to afford foothold the effects of the drug
had again worn off and i sat down and
prepared to take another dose i did so-
the smallest amount i could-and held
ready in my hand a pill of the other kind
in case of emergency steadily the walls
closed in

  a terrible feeling of dizziness now came
over me i clutched the rock beside which
 was sitting and it seemed to melt like ice
beneath my grasp then i remembered see-
ing the edge of the canon within reach
above my head and with my last remain-
ing strength i pulled myself up and fell
upon the surface of the ring you know
the rest i took another dose of the pow-
der and in a few minutes was back among
you

  the chemist stopped speaking and
looked at his friends well he said
youve heard it all what do you think
of it

  it is a terrible thing to me sighed the
very young man that you did not bring
lylda with you

  it would have been a terrible thing if
i had brought her but i am going back
for her

  when do you plan to go back asked
the doctor after a moment

  as soon as i can-in a day or two
answered the chemist

  before you do your work here you
must not remonstrated the big business
man our nation may need you you
cannot go

  lylda needs me too returned the
chemist i have an obligation toward


famous fantastic mysteries

her now you know quite apart from my
own feelings understand me gentlemen
he continued earnestly i do not mean to
place myself and mine before the great
fight for democracy and justice which
may soon be waged that would be ab-
surd but it is not quite that way actu-
ally i can go back for lylda and return
here in a week

  any time that you should take said
the banker slowly might cost this world
thousands of lives that you could save
have you thought of that

  the chemist flushed i can recognize
the salvation of a nation or a cause he
returned hotly but if i must choose be-
tween the lives of a thousand men who are
not dependent on me and the life or wel-
fare of one woman who is i shall choose
the woman

  hes right you know said the doc-
tor and the very young man agreed with
him fervently

  two days later the company met again
in the privacy of the club-room when
they had finished dinner the chemist be-
gan in his usual quiet way

  i am going to ask you this time gen-
tlemen to give me a full week there are
four of you-six hours a day of watching
for each it need not be too great a hard-
ship you see he continued as they
nodded in agreement i want to spend a
longer period in the ring world this time
i may never go back and i want to learn
in the interest of science as much about it
as i can i was there such a short time be-
fore and it was all so strange and remark-
able i confess i learned practically noth-
ing

  i told you all i could of its history
but of its art its science and all its socio-
logical and economic questions i got hard-
ly more than a glimpse it is a world and
a people far less advanced than ours yet
with something we have not and probably
never will have-the universally distributed
milk of human kindness yes gentlemen
it is a world well worth studying

  the banker came out of a brown study
how about your formulas for these

drugs he asked abruptly where are
they the chemist tapped his forehead
smilingly well hadnt you better leave
them with us the banker pursued the
hazards of your trip-you cant tell-

  dont misunderstand me gentlemen
broke in the chemist i wouldnt give
you those formulas if my life and even
lyldas depended on it there again you
do not differentiate between the individual
and the race i know you four very well
you are my friends with all the bond that
friendship implies i believe in your in-
tegrity-each of you i trust implicitly
with these formulas you could crush na-
tions or you could any one of you rule
the world with all its treasures for your
own these drugs are the most powerful
thing for good in the world to-day but
they are equally as powerful for evil i
would stake my life on what you would
do but i will not stake the life of a na-
tion

  i know what id do if i had the for-
mulas began the very young man

  yes but i dont know what youd do
laughed the chemist dont you see im
right they admitted they did though
the banker acquiesced very grudgingly

  the time of my departure is at hand
is there anything else gentlemen before
i leave you asked the chemist begin-
ning to disrobe

  please tell lylda i want very much to
meet her said the very young man
earnestly and they all laughed

  when the room was cleared and the
handkerchief and ring in place once more
the chemist turned to them again good-
by my friends he said holding out his
hands one week from to-night at most
then he took the pills

  no unusual incident marked his depar-
ture the last they saw of him he was
calmly sitting on the ring near the scratch

  then passed the slow days of watching
each taking his turn for the allotted six
hours

  by the fifth day they began hourly to
expect the chemist but it passed through
its weary length and he did not come the
the girl in the golden atom



sixth day dragged by and then came the
last-the day he had promised would end
their watching still he did not come and
in the evening they gathered and all four
watchedtogether each unwilling to miss
the return of the adventurer and his wo-
man from another world

  but the minutes lengthened into hours
and midnight found the white-faced little
group hopeful yet hopeless with fear tug-
ging at their hearts a second week passed
and still they watched explaining with an
optimism they could none of them feel the
non-appearance of their friend at the end
of the second week they met again to talk
the situation over a dull feeling of fear
and horror possessing them the doctor
was the first to voice what now each of
them was forced to believe i guess its
all useless he said hes not coming
back

  the doctor sat for some time in silence
thoughtfully regarding the ring my
friends he began finally this is too big
a thing to deal with in any but the most
careful way i cant imagine what is go-

ing on inside that ring but i do know what
is happening in our world and what our
friends return means to civilization here
under the circumstances therefore i can-
not i will not give him up

  i am going to put that ring in a mu-
seum and pay for having it watched in-
definitely will you join me he turned
to the big business man as he spoke

  make it a threesome said the banker
gruffly

  and so to-day if you like you may go
and see the ring it lies in the museum
of the american society for biological re-
search you will find it near the center of
the third gallery lying on its black-silk
handkerchief and covered by a glass bell
the air in the bell is renewed constantly
and near at hand sit two armed guards
watching day and night and as you stand
before it thinking of the wonderful world
within its atoms you well may shudder
at your infinite unimportance as an indi-
vidual and yet glow with pride at your
divine omnipotence as a fragment of human
life

chapter i

flight

 always the drums talked in the
za distance ceasing neither by night
 nor day he had lost track of
time he knew only that open country
lay somewhere to the south toward it
he drove himself by instinct draining
himself of last reserves of energy that
should long ago have been exhausted he
fled from the drums and their prophecy
of doom but always they throbbed with
a monotonous and maddening beat

  his face was haggard a wild light shone
in his deep-sunken eyes beard matted his
cheeks and his hair straggled unkempt
in his blind flight the jungle had tat-
tered his clothing his sun-baked skin
bore the scratches of thorns and the weals
of insect bite fever consumed him but
not even delirium could end the fear that
forced him on to protect the treasure he
carried

  he plunged through green nightmare
only twilight filtered down from the roof
of trees and creepers the tangle of foliage
and branches the vegetation dripped


his body was about to die-so they put his mind in
the body of a panther-and turned the panther loose

moisture his feet squashed sodden de-
caying matter the air steamed like a
hothouse with a wet and musty smell

  amid the half-light an evil beauty
flourished upon death immense orchids
black as ebony or blood-scarlet striped
with golden green purple or waxy white
reared their fantastically gorgeous blos-
soms out of slime and rotting mold
macaws squawked harshly hummingbirds
and tanagers made streaks of brilliant
color there were mushrooms two feet
tall and mottled with scabrous pink

malaria mosquitoes and carrion flies
droned while now and then the savage
scream of a mandril silenced the monkeys

  crocodiles chased him when he splashed
through a murky pool of the stream he
was following later he floundered across
a swamp waist-deep in ooze the slime-
covered surface rippled he felt the touch
of soft and horrible things that wriggled

  no sane man could have survived so
frightful a passage he should have died
a hundred deaths he should have left
his flesh and bones to rot with all that


famous fantastic mysteries

other decaying matter he reeled onward

  he passed ancient ruins engulfed by
the tide of vegetation but still preserving
a basic outline upon colossal blocks of
fallen masonry were incised symbols of a
language unknown he had heard legends
of lost cities such as this but he did not
stop to investigate he clambered across
mounds and slippery walls

  and always the drums talked throb-
bing afar surrounding him with doom
the heavy revolver lay ever ready in his
hand he expected each moment to feel a
poisoned dart or a spear to meet a ring
of painted and grotesquely masked faces
he saw no one

  a tangible foe would have ended the
persistent torture of his nerves his was
the terror of expectancy of inevitable
death postponed from minute to minute
he must keep going keep going with
the stolen witch-charm his prize if he
won out he stumbled on blindly

chapter ii

the witch-makers

two white men looked down at the
cot where the unconscious figure lay
bandaged the younger man of square
build and overweight for his five feet nine
asked in a deep quiet voice what are
his chances burt

  he hasnt any oh the proverbial
one in a million at the outside the older
man answered in a dry rather testy tone
dr ezra l burton was a spare and bony
scarecrow his semi-bald head fringed with
sandy hair what was visible of his fea-
tures looked ruddy but mostly they were
concealed by a black beard of full and
alarming proportions he added its a
miracle that the duffer ever got out of the
jungle ive done what i could but hes
dying

  travers i sometimes think that med-
ical science so-called is a brutal farce
what was the use of patching him up
today so that he can die tomorrow hes
going to die he should have died days
ago but some silly will to live kept him

going until he stumbled into our camp
it would have been better for him if he
died in delirium now hell wake up just
long enough to know hes dying and to
hate himself for it and to hate us for
giving him a lease on life just long enough
to know hes through

  travers filled a briar pipe and lighted it

  theres nothing to identify him ex-
cept his initials burton poked a blunt
and gnarled forefinger among the collec-
tion removed from the strangers pockets
it included a bandana cheap watch mag-
nifying glass some coins and gold nug-
gets pocket knife cartridge belt matches
and the  with the initials l a
carved on its butt amid these items lay
a remarkable figurine about six or seven
inches tall

  a little less than three inches of it rep-
resented a misshapen torso and spindly
arms and legs of solid gold the rest was
an enormous emerald for its head of
rectangular shape it had been beveled to
portray a two-faced monster of inhuman
and unearthly attributes suggesting abys-
mal antiquity beyond history the edges
of the jewel had rounded from the wear
of countless generations of hands

  burton lifted the weird figurine he
would seem to have been an itinerant
trader this idol probably is the key to the
mystery it looks like a fetish some witch
doctors symbol of power or some tribes
emerald god i suppose the chap stole it
it isnt exactly the kind of thing you
expect stray visitors to carry around with
them as to who he is my guess would
be leif abbot but its only a guess

  leif abbot

  i know of him by hearsay a yankee
trader with a flair for digging into hidden
places in other words a complete fool
or trail blazer depending on your point
of view born in the mid-west minnesota
or wisconsin as i recall went to africa
a few years ago fooled colonial officials
tricked the natives played both ends
against the middle and became a sort of
legend an imaginative cuss with a heart
of gold-fools gold
the witch-makers



  travers asked i wonder if he had any-
thing to do with the drums we heard a
while back

  i meant to find out about them ill
see what that black thief mokoalli has
to say

  after burton stalked out of the tent
travers dropped into a folding chair

  growls snarls and chattering made an
uproar outside the tent it was always
thus at nightfall when the jungle crea-
tures could be heard afar and the cap-
tured animals grew restless within the
camp enclosure rows of cages held speci-
mens of the districts life lion jackal
ape and zebra python and mamba buz-
zard ostrich even eels and brightly striped
fishes lurked in the tanks and cages

  travers glanced at the stranger who
was breathing heavily with a rattle in his
throat

in the same tent looking oddly out of
place stood modern scientific mate-
rials of obscure and specialized purpose
a metal operating table rested beside a
curious device that had been assembled
from numerous parts these included a
small dynamo some queerly shaped glass
tubes and ovaloids reminiscent of x-ray
apparatus and two tiny plates with a
mass of wires hanging from each like fine
golden hair

  travers reached out and picked up the
grotesque idol he hefted it reflectively
fascinated by its eyes in different colors
and the way glimmers of green flame
welled from the heart of the great emer-
ald there might be fifty or a hundred
dollars worth of gold in the idol but the
jewel must be worth a thousand times as
much and the entire object even more as
a curio or museum piece

  he continued to inspect the gem when
burton strode in his black beard waving
while beads of sweat glistened on his
ruddy forehead mokoalli is a liar as
well as a thief burton announced in the
tone of a weather report he stole one
of my best scalpels which i said he could
keep if he told me the truth whereupon he

gave me nothing but the most outrageous
lies he said the drums were talking not
because the jungle tribes were tracking
the fugitive down but to warn other
tribes to keep out of his way they
thought he was bad medicine driven by
devils and though hed made off with a
powerful charm they were afraid to touch
him till the devils consumed him they
were just keeping an eye on him thats
mokoallis story moko is a liar i took
the scalpel back

  travers removed the pipe from his
mouth did it occur to you that he might
have been telling the truth

  burton looked surprised why no it
didnt

  i think he earned the scalpel

  hell steal it again soon enough
the savage mind works in queer ways
the emerald that means a fortune to us
wouldnt mean a thing to them except as
a fetish or idol if they were afraid of
abbot they might well have waited until
he died before reclaiming the charm they
might even have expected the emerald god
to take vengeance and kill him then
when he stumbled toward our camp the
drums stopped

  thats what moko said the natives
seem to be pretty much afraid of us by
now

  do you blame them travers with
a glance at the fugitive suggested lets
break camp as soon as he comes around
or passes on weve got our data there
isnt much more we could accomplish here
our works done another three months
of this and ill be fit for the booby hatch
besides the war zone seems to be creep-
ing up on us ive seen airplanes in the
east twice in the past week one of these
days a bomber may pick us out for tar-
get practice or some fancy ground
strafing

  burton tugged at his beard reflectively
he felt the pulse of the patient listened
to his heartbeat and took his temperature
in the course of a careful examination
he shrugged as he turned away hes
done for a day or two at most even if


famous fantastic mysteries

he recovers consciousness which is prob-
lematical hes too far gone for recovery
well break camp as soon as possible
good

  but added burton with a new note
of decision in his voice we will im-
mortalize him by using him as our first
human control

  travers frowned why if hes on the
way out what good would it do

  its his body thats broken down if
he regains consciousness his mind and in-
telligence should be relatively unimpaired
its only his life force his vital spark
the unit of identity that is his mentality
which we need and we may be able to
prolong his life somewhat in any case
here is an outside chance to obtain data
of immense i might say priceless impor-
tance

  as you say weve successfully finished
our work with the animal controls the
ape-jackal interchange simply corrobo-
rated earlier findings there is nothing
more to be learned by duplicating previ-
ous experiments we need a human control
our next step must involve a human con-
trol if we are to open up vast new fields
for research

burtons accents had taken an in-
trospective tone as though he ex-
pressed aloud a passionate inner conviction
that drove him thus far we have only
objective data the lower vertebrates
couldnt tell us their reactions and ex-
periences in a new environment only
man can do that for us weve already
made revolutionary discoveries but we
stand on the threshold of a greater miracle
than anything weve yet seen or done

  we interchanged the lives of a monkey
and a fox do you remember how elated
we were with the success of that first ex-
periment how we watched the fox in
the monkeys body cling to the ground
how the monkey in the foxs body vainly
tried to swing through the tree tops we
put the personality of a rhinoceros into
the body of a zebra and that gentle ani-
mal became a driving tearing juggernaut

of death while the great rhino inhabited
by the zebras spirit fled in fear from the
lion it could have crushed

  for weeks and months travers weve
torn spirit and flesh asunder here in
fifty square miles that contain almost
every kind of the climate and life of af-
rica weve learned more about animal
behavior during our three months than
all mankind learned in three thousand
years weve stolen a march on evolution
weve knocked the natural selection of
species into a cocked hat

  why cant we do the same with the
spirit of man maybe we cant but we
wont know till weve tried and if we
try and succeed would you even attempt
to estimate how much well enrich mans
imagination and add to his knowledge
think of what it would mean if we en-
abled man to look at the world through
the eyes of his pets a dog or a cat or a
horse wouldnt he have a more tender
feeling toward them and a more profound
appreciation of his own capacities isnt
it possible that in course of time his pets
would acquire a new intelligence of the
order of humanity isnt it conceivable
that they could then be trained to speak
with results in strange unimaginable new
friendships

  and after that travers-after that-
the transference of intelligence from one
man to another  its a magnificent and
terrifying thought isnt it if we made it
possible where would it end in greater
peace for mankind would he understand
his fellow men better and comprehend
more fully their weaknesses and follies
their dreams and nobilities would he
spy upon his friends and try to benefit
by what he learned would each man
cease to be an individual as he gradually
absorbed the characteristics and peculiari-
ties of other men or would he become
more rapacious than ever before carried
away by the thirst for knowledge made
drunk by the infinite capacity for un-
limited power

  i cant answer my own questions
travers theyre beyond answer except
the witch-makers



in the fateful mold of experience but
we have it within our hands to take the
first deliberate step the step upon which
all else hinges well be tampering with
the mysteries of life yes but its life thats
hopelessly doomed anyway abbot if he
is abbot can die unconscious and forgot-
ten or he can have experiences never
dreamed of in his last hours he can die
with the certainty of a posthumous im-
mortality that will never fade until earth
itself runs its course or man perishes in
the eons of the far future

  you might at least wait till he comes
to he ought to have his say about
whether he wants to be a guinea-pig and
theres the little matter of the emerald

  burton shook his head decisively his
beard jerked like an erratic pendulum
the emerald we can donate it to a
museum he wont recover and as for the
experiment perhaps he would object if
he could i dont suppose hell thank us
for extending his life under altered cir-
cumstances that is too much to expect
and hes apt to suffer a severe shock
when and if he awakens but hell recover
more quickly and adjust himself better
than if he approached the experiment with
all the fears his imagination could pro-
vide

  suppose the one chance in a million
pulls him through what if he survives
he could make it pretty hot for us so-
ciety might not approve of our methods
or our goals

  thats why were here instead of in
a nice comfortable laboratory at home
if all experiments were subject to the
whims and censorship of society civiliza-
tion would still be in the dark ages

  that wont be answer enough if he
survives

   well find answers when the need arises
and while i stand here arguing with you
his hold on life grows thinner and if we
dont act immediately our great oppor-
tunity will be gone

  burton walked over to the dynamo and
started it a low hum like the buzz of
a persistent mosquito filled the tent what

looked like mist in one of the oddly shaped
tubes glowed with a milky light the mist
became rapidly less opaque until only a
softly shimmering radiance remained

  he slipped a metal band around his
head the band had a small bulb and
reflector in front he pressed the switch
a beam of light leaped out he removed
the unconscious man from the cot to the
operating table arranged a numer of sur-
gical tools and pulled rubber gloves over
his hands

  then he left the tent a few minutes
after his return mokoalli and another
native panting and grunting brought a

sullenly

  as the patter of footsteps receded bur-
ton with a dextrous motion plunged a
hypodermic through the bars of the cage
the beast roared and lunged viciously
at his arm

snipped the hair off the base of his skull

droned like a relentless carion fly

strange awakening

leif abbot passed from one fantas-
tic dream to another in some he
was a boy on the mid-western prairies
chased by monsters foreign to all the
continents in others he wandered end-
lessly through forests and jungles alone
and hopelessly lost or accompanied by
dead friends and pursued by invisible
terrors there were periods of blankness
and periods of skyrocketing flashes at
times he was almost on the verge of


famous fantastic mysteries

knowing that he dreamed but then he
slipped away again into the phantasma-
goria of unconsciousness

  pain entered his dreams he was run-
ning running running with leaden steps
that took him forward more slowly than
the progress of tortoises balanced upon
his head was a great cube of gold that
for some reason he could neither touch
nor dislodge he was compelled to stagger
onward with that intolerable weight while
his shadowy pursuers drew nearer with
the speed of hawks knives flying in all
directions impaled him

  then the nightmare lay behind him
his head throbbed he felt stifled and
breathed unevenly but he knew that the
dream had ended he lay still his eyes
closed as he half-remembered his last
hours of consciousness buala the witch
doctor-the emerald god that had passed
from tribe to tribe and from father to son
through untold ages until it fell into
bualas custody-his days of haggling and
cajoling with buala adamant in his super-
stitious faith in the emerald gods magic
powers

  leif abbot had wanted that treasure
when he couldnt get it by more or less
legitimate -means he took it by theft
in spite of his african adventures how-
ever he had underestimated the emeralds
influence and prestige he awoke one night
to find his own carriers attacking him and
to hear the throb of drums he escaped
with the jewel but his porters and guides
deserted him taking all his supplies

  he could have followed the river which
would have taken him downstream
through hostile villages that he now could
not pass through and live he chose the
southward course toward the headwaters
and open country where he had heard
rumors about two white men whom the
natives called witch-makers then
came the nightmare of his flight through
the green hell the insect hordes fever
thirst hunger and finally delirium he
remembered nothing from that point on

  his thoughts growing clearer each mo-
ment he opened his eyes a roof lay curi-

ously near scarcely a yard above his
head he was lying on his side on the
floor bars interfered with his vision but
he saw two white men in the interior of
the tent and-lying upon an operating
table his own body

  leif abbot closed his eyes in a daze
he must be dead or in the grip of de-
lirium still an odd panic filled him a
premonition

  he forced his eyes open again and
stared at the figure on the table he was
unquestionably looking at his own emaci-
ated fever-ridden body with a metallic
gleam showing through bandages on its
head

  suddenly afraid he strove to rise un-
able to balance on his legs he toppled
crazily and fell with a jarring thud his
head throbbed a moan of pain came
from his lips-but to his ears it sounded
like the whimper of an animal

  the room reeled around in his vision
as he fell his head lowered and his
stunned gaze fastened upon the padded
paws of a beast and black-furred legs
they seemed part of him he stretched
out a hand and stared in the hypnotism
of horror as a paw scraped the floor
where his hand should have been

for a timeless drag of eternity he lay
immobile trying to figure some mean-
ing out of the strange distortion of things
he was not dead because he was not
disembodied yet he stood apart from his
rightful body which lay beyond the bars
the cage inclosed a beast and he was
the beast

  as his thoughts skittered through this
new waking nightmare he became con-
scious of a voice it sounded extraordi-
narily loud and shrill like a thunderclap
he realized vaguely that he had difficulty
understanding the words and that the
room was filled with a multitude of famil-
iar sounds magnified in volume while
other sounds of which he had never before
been aware assailed his hearing his ears
had acquired a preternatural sensitivity in
the amplified breathing of the speaker he
the witch-makers



heard the lungs expand and contract the
heart beat he heard a fly crawl on the
canvas of the tent when the second man
tilted his pipe he heard fingers rasp on
the bowl and a rustle as of raindrops
when some ashes fell to the floor

  leif abbot if you are leif abbot can
you hear me asked the booming voice

  the beast in the cage scrambled to all
fours and swayed against the bars glar-
ing sullenly out he lowered and raised
his head

  before the speaker could continue there
came a wild interruption leif abbot
looking through the bars saw his body
stiffen on the operating table the eyes
opened with an expression of animal fero-
city ropes bound the body but it burst
the ropes with a surge of strength that
leif abbot in all his life had not equaled

  the mouth parted but from that human
throat came a snarl born of the jungle
the body hurtled across the tent in the
spring of an animal teeth bared arms
outstretched like paws ready to rip and
gouge the white men scattered and for
seconds a furious battle raged the white
men won but only because leif abbots
body was too exhausted to endure the ter-
rific strain put upon it by the untamed
spirit within

  when the struggle ended the body lay
motionless under the influence of an opi-
ate the taller of the men the one with
the waving black beard painted their
scratches and wounds with iodine

  after he had finished he turned again
toward the cage i am dr burton my
colleague is dr travers a physicist and
biochemist we have been engaged in ex-
periments here for several months when
you staggered half dead into our camp
we were compelled to adopt extreme meas-
ures or you would already be dead

  do not be alarmed whatever seems
incredible to you is really very simple we
have discovered how to separate the life-
stream or consciousness or whatever you
want to call it from the body to which
it belongs and to effect an exchange with
some other body thus far we have worked

only with the lower vertebrates in your
case your chances for survival as leif
abbot were so small that we operated upon
the six layers of your cerebral cortex and
transferred your identity to the body of
a strong and healthy black panther the
panthers identity now occupies your own
sick and weakened body by this inter-
change we hope to strengthen your body
sufficiently so that your identity can later
be restored to it with better chances for
your recovery and survival

  in the meantime the door to your cage
is open behind you go into the jungle
if you like you probably will be better
off there you have all the intelligence of
man and all the senses and instincts of
the big cats you should be able to avoid
any danger and survive any attack

  leif abbot attempted to answer but
only a rumbling growl issued from his
throat his new vocal cords either were
not capable of speech or would require
long practice

  the greenish yellow eyes of the panther
glowered his mute hatred burtons glib
explanation failed to satisfy him not for
an instant did he believe blackbeard and
his companion they wanted the emerald
god for which he had risked his life what
poorly paid scientist would pass up such
an opportunity for easy wealth they
didnt have courage enough to let him die
or to kill him but it would be murder
just the same in a different form more
protracted and under the guise of science

  neither burton nor travers spoke again
they watched him in silence and he in
turn glared balefully from them to the
emerald that still lay among his effects
its glitter matched by the smoldering flame
in his eyes

  turbulent emotions swept him hatred
rankled at the back of his thoughts he
tried to adjust himself to his weird change
of state he plotted a dozen ways of
tricking them in order to regain possesion
of his treasure but he hopelessly confused
his lost resources as man and his as yet
unknown abilities as panther forgetting
his new form momentarily he tried to


famous fantastic mysteries

grasp the bars of the cage but his paws
merely slid along the bars he had no
fingers to help him now he had never
before appreciated so fully the infinite
utility of hands

  probably they were merely awaiting his
departure into the jungle before killing
the panther-spirit that now occupied his
real body and there was absolutely noth-
ing he could do for the present except
take their advice before they changed their
minds he might be doomed to die in the
jungle but while he lived he could scheme
ways of vengeance

  he stared for the last time at his captors
then turned and bounded into the dark-
ness outside

chapter iv

the black marauder

the rest of the night all the next
day and the following night the black
panther remained away burton and trav-
ers watched the body of leif abbot which
seemed to grow stronger under the drive
of the fierce animal spirit that now dwelt
within it 

  toward dawn of the second day bur-
ton awakened from a fitful sleep to hear
a weight dragging on the ground he
sprang up and flashed a light on it the
panther its right hind leg broken and
bleeding from numerous wounds dragged
itself forward it did not whimper its
glazing eyes still burned with sultry hatred
and rebellion though death fast approached
travers quick burton shouted
turn on the psychotransferometer get
out adrenalin scopolamin

  he leaped to the dying panther and
gathered it in his arms its savage heart
beat heavily he carried it to the oper-
ating table and laid it beside the shackled
body of leif abbot

  the hum of the dynamo had already
begun pale vaporous light shone in the
vacuum tube burton fastened the silver
plate in the panthers skull and the sim-
ilar plate in abbots cranium to wires con-
nected with the transference apparatus

  it was not a torrid night but sweat
glistened on his face he watched anx-
iously tugging at his beard

  travers shook his head in doubt
afraid its too late if hed only come
back an hour sooner-

  as though in mockery at his words
the gleam of animal ferocity suddenly re-
turned to the panthers eyes for a mo-
ment it snarled at them and made an
effort to attack it shuddered while its
eyes filmed more swiftly the brute thirst
faded from the eyes of leif abbot as his
human identity re-entered his body a
gleam of sanity and intelligence lingered
for seconds gradually to be replaced by
an expression of trance-like repose and sus-
pended will-power when the drugs took
effect

  burton heaved a deep sigh a close
call that a few minutes more and our
trouble would have gone for nothing too
bad the panther died but we have all the
notes we need on its behavior while it
occupied leif abbots body and now lets
see if he can or will tell us what he did
in the part of a black panther

  he bent over and looked into the sub-
jects eyes they were wide open but the
hypnotic blankness had grown complete
leif abbot can you hear me

  the lips hardly moved to give a faint
answer yes

  last night in the body of a panther
you left us you have been gone for two
nights and a day where did you go what
did you do what happened to you after
you left how did you receive the
wounds

speaking as though from a distance
his unblinking eyes exhibiting no
change of expression leif abbot said
when i crept out of the boma the
moon rode high it was a red moon it
bathed the plain in blood black shadows
and scarlet moonlight all the world was
strange i have never seen so strange a
world it was like the landscape of an-
other planet

  i heard sounds beyond the range of my
the witch-makers



normal ears the wings of night birds the
gliding of a snake an indescribable chorus
of separate sounds around me and drifting
from the distant jungle i heard grass
rustle in the faintest of winds i saw colors
that no man has ever watched they are
beyond the spectrum of his eyes but my
panther eyes saw them i cant tell what
they were like any more than you could
describe color to somebody blind from
birth you would have to see those eerie
colors for yourselves

  all my senses were immensely keener
i detected smells of hundreds of different
plants flowers animals insects decaying
matter and other things where before i
had noticed only a sort of general dank
mustiness in the air i was queerly mixed
up as a panther i noticed all these im-
pressions for what they were as a man i
couldnt identify more than a part of
them i had half-memories that didnt
quite bridge the gap between my own
knowledge and the panthers instincts and
habits certain odors made me afraid the
panther knew that they came from pois-
onous plants

  i didnt know what to do at first
for a while i strode around accustom-
ing myself to going on all fours and to
the movements of unfamiliar muscles
gradually i got a feeling of power for
there was the strength of several men in
that long sleek and ripplingly muscled
body i tried crouching and leaping and
found that pounces of twenty feet and
more came effortlessly

  i traveled northward downhill toward
the jungle i had some vague idea of hunt-
ing for buala and taking vengeance on
his tribe it was a crazy idea because if
any vengeance was to be taken it really
belonged to him at the edge of the jungle
i stopped i could see into it better than
i could in the daytime with human vision
it was filled with a kind of grayish green
light more ghostly than twilight the shad-
ows were blackly green and the patches
of moonlight a sort of ghastly red

  maybe thats the way the jungle al-
ways looks to the great cats by night i

dont know thats the way it looked to
me and it gave me the creeps my fears
as man carried over into my life as pan-
ther i shied at going into that monstrous
tangle

  besides i had an inner pull to travel
eastward i couldnt account for it un-
less some latent instinct of the panther
was asserting itself finally i began to
ramble toward the east keeping at the
fringe of the jungle in a long gliding
run that i found easy to maintain

  i put hours and miles behind me i
followed the instinct that urged me on
while doing so i became more confident
in myself and more sure of my pantherine
body

  loping through broken hilly country
that was beginning to show a sharp up-
ward rise some hours later i felt a pull
toward the northeast i turned from my
course into the hills and went back to
the tangle i found a dim spoor that
lured me on my surroundings looked as
if they ought to be familiar i almost re-
membered but not quite

  there came a turn in the faint trail
i followed i reached the base of a cluster
of rocks with no intention on my part
a kind of spitting growl broke from my
throat it was instantly answered by a
yowl from a black and cavernous open-
ing that i now noticed a panther emerged
a female with a couple of cubs at her
heels i stopped in my tracks

  for just an instant the creature was
on the verge of greeting me home and i
knew that instinct had brought me to the
mate of the black panther whose body i
had taken possession of she was deceived
only for moments by whatever subtle or
primitive sense she knew that i was an
alien presence a menace she came
through the air a snarling fury with
claws raking in an attack that caught me
by surprise

  i suppose i could have put up a battle
royal i didnt i dont know why prob-
ably some atavistic feeling of chivalry that
was a hangover from my previous life
made me turn tail and flee as if all the


famous fantastic mysteries

devils in hell were yapping at my heels
that female cat was a demon if ever
there was one she ripped a shoulder wide
open and took a chunk out of my neck
before i got away those cursed cubs
tumbled around and yowled in glee i wish
id knocked the whole litter into kingdom
come

  the sky was turning lighter i left the
denser thickets and ran toward higher
ground

  after that i decided to go very easy
about trusting instincts i sniffed the air
and got wind of a water hole

  there i drank greedily and shook my-
self in the tepid water it soothed the
wounds i couldnt reach there was a
rocky ledge beside a trail that animals
used in reaching the water hole i bounded
on top of it and lay down to await sun-
rise

  while i rested a deer came mincing
along the trail it was a beautiful crea-
ture a doe i watched it drink and ad-
mired its graceful motions as it frisked
away toward the grazing country to the
south and when it was gone i found
that i was ravenously hungry and that i
had blithely let my dinner skip off

  my human scruples did not mean a
thing inthis case a panthers body sup-
ported me and i had to support it in the
manner to which it was accustomed i
waited a half hour before i spotted a wild
boar i made short work of it eating
meat still on the hoof didnt exactly appeal
to me but my substitute palate gorged
itself

  i felt drowsy then i turned toward
the fringe of the jungle in search of a
safe nook for a nap i was looking for a
high ledge or a cave but didnt find any-
thing with suitable protection i scouted
farther away from the water hole trek-
king toward thicker jungle as i was
prowling along the trail a sudden crackle
gave me warning but not warning enough
the ground opened beneath me i made
a vain scramble but felt myself falling
when i hit bottom the wind was knocked
out of me

chapter v

the panther strikes

rphough i didnt fall a great dis-

  -i- tance i landed on my neck and
shoulders with stunning force i lay there
for perhaps a minute before i grew con-
scious of a pain in my right hind leg i
tried to get up it was torture beyond
me i squirmed around and in the dim
light saw that the bottom of the pit held
fire-hardened stakes imbedded point up
one of these had pierced the leg it was
only pure luck that others hadnt im-
paled me i had fallen into an animal
trap

  a quick careful jerk of the leg brought
agony and freedom i licked the wound
looking around then i estimated my
chances of leaping from the pit at exactly
zero the stakes had been cleverly placed
and the pit so constructed as to make
it impossible for any beast to escape yet
i escaped

  how it was absurdly simple for a
creature who could think i took a stake
between my teeth and pulled it out i
turned the sharp point toward the earth
wall and pushed it as far in as i could
with my jaws holding the blunt end in
my jaws and pushing at the same time
with two paws grasping the stake i im-
bedded it for half its length

  i removed another stake and drove it
in beside the first i continued the process
until i had formed a ladder of stakes in
pairs as high as i could reach it took
time and every second i was desperately
afraid that the hunters would come for
the kill before i got out

  my wounded leg hurt badly i fell
several times trying to climb the stakes
but on the fourth try i eased my weight
onto the top pair then i rose in a swift
half-turn on my hind legs the stakes gave
but i had my forelegs over the edge of the
pit and pulled myself out with my hind
legs shoving and digging into the wall
the pain was intolerable after i had re-
gained freedom i rested for several min-
utes my ears listening for footsteps i
the witch-makers



would have killed any human being that
came in sight if i could my rage wore
off and i forgot the wound temporarily
when i thought of a sardonic jest

  i went to work with a will and a
vengeance ten minutes later i was crouch-
ing on the limb of a tree hidden by foliage
and with the pit barely visible the jungle
steadily grew hotter as the sun mounted
higher

  i was feeling drowsy again when my
ears pricked to the sounds of a party
approaching there were seven of them
i watched intently until the first a strap-
ping young buck with chest and cheeks
cicatrised came into view carrying a long
lance the only other thing he wore besides
a loin cloth was a crude bracelet of some
sort twisted tightly around his left arm
almost at the shoulder i dont know what
it signified or why he wore it there i
noticed it because his left arm flashed up
in a signal and he let out a yell you
could have heard a mile off

  the six others gathered around him
all jabbering at once and all getting more
pop-eyed by the second i chose that in-
stant to do the best i could on a loud
laugh even to me the result was weird
they fled like so many rabibts

  they looked scared silly my jest had
been a complete success i had scraped a
patch of ground smooth upon it using
my paw as a pen i had scrawled yours
truly the king of the panthers and un-
der the signature i had drawn the rough
outline of a panthers head

  the natives probably couldnt have
read anything in any language but they
knew what writing was they recognized
the panthers head they saw that there
were no human tracks in the vicinity
except their own they saw how the
panther had escaped from the trap for
the rest of their lives theyll be talking
about the panther god or devil that left
his signature

  i drew back to a crotch in the tree
and dozed there

  the sun stood overhead when distant
reports that seemed to come from the east

wakened me they sounded like gunshots
i leaped to the ground and limbered up the
injured leg after a first sharp pain it be-
came manageable though it remained
stiff and throbbed persistently forcing
me to limp a little

  i kept to higher ground where i had
good vision in all directions from time to
time i saw small parties of natives once
i heard and saw a squadron of airplanes
to the northeast

  in a couple of hours or so i reached
a region of sheer rock escarpments hills
deep ravines and narrow passes there
were patches of dense semi-tropical jungle
around water holes elsewhere grew thick-
ets of thorn stunted trees and sometimes
sparse brown grass i heard the movements
of a considerable force ahead guided
by the sounds i struck off at a tangent
and hid in the shadow of a large boulder
atop a dolomite

  over the crest of a hill came native
scouts in advance of a detachment of
white infantry and native troops in all
the raiding party consisted of about two
hundred of whom three-fourths were na-
tive troops they looked like somalis to
me

  the white men except for the officers
werent tanned enough or lean enough to
have been hardened by long fighting in
the tropics i judged them to be fairly
recent arrivals all were heavily armed

uddenly a rifle cracked then
another intermittent shots poured
from an ambush ahead one of the white
men fell a couple of natives staggered
when they were hit the rest was merely
efficient slaughter two machine guns went
into action like magic and peppered the
hillside thicket there were a few answer-
ing shots a few of the black defenders
charged into the open mowed down by
the fusillade none of them escaped about
a dozen seemed to have been posted in
the ambush

  red rage seethed inside of me you
have to see things like that in the wild
unknown places of the world to know the


famous fantastic mysteries

seamy side of colonial wars and imperial
aggression twelve against two hundred-
twelve armed with  springfields and
muskets so ancient and rusty that they
couldnt tell whether the pin would hit
or the cartridge explode when they pulled
the trigger-twelve against modern rifles
machine guns and grenades

  it didnt make any difference that
id stolen a treasure from buala when i
couldnt get it otherwise at least i hadnt
tried to kick him off of his own land or
put a bullet through him when he couldnt
see the deal my way i was mad enough
to start a one-man or rather a one-panther
campaign against the whole detachment
idiotic sure but heres how it worked
out

  i crept down from the dolomite and
detoured ahead until i found a suitable
spot for my purposes at a v-neck that
the column must pass and where the legend
could not possibly be missed i scratched
on the ground

warning go back

the king of the panthers

  a quarter-mile beyond the v-neck i
jumped to the top of a great pile of fallen
rocks where i could easily be seen sil-
houetted against the sky i had not waited
long before the scouts found my message
and my tracks one of them ran back to the
main body in great excitement the others
noticed me and stared at me i stared at
them the moment i saw sunlight gleam
on a rifle barrel swinging up i dropped
behind the rocks bullets whined past i
took a quick peek and saw a cluster of
troops gesticulating and waving over my
message

  the native troops had obviously re-
ceived a scare and the whites were trying
to quiet their fears it seemed as though
they all saw me and turned toward me
at once there was a moments complete
silence while i looked down toward them
then i slipped away among the fallen
masses of rock and the scrub thorn as
more lead hornets buzzed

i doubled back by much the same route

until i was well behind the raiders then i
started catching up with them again

  i singled out a victim at the very tail
of the column keeping well to the rear
i took advantage of every possible conceal-
ment until the right moment came when
he was temporarily cut off from the rest
by a twist in the defile he saw me just
before i hit him his eyes popped he
didnt have time to squawk i landed on
his shoulders he slammed against rock
and when his skull hit there came the
sharp snap of a neck breaking  lifted
his rifle between my teeth and got back
in the brush then i let out a terrific
screech  watched just long enough to see
several white and native troops rush back
morale took another blow

  i had the devil of a time lugging
that rifle in a circuitous detour toward
the head of the column i had to stay well
covered and at a distance or light gleam-
ing on a barrel would have betrayed me
when i reached a vantage point my leg
was throbbing worse i was striking for
the last time in my one-panther campaign
and i determined to make it a telling shot

  beyond the v-neck stretched a valley
that lay between rock bluffs a number
of mud-holes extended along the valley like
beads on a string each surrounded by
grass dwarf palms and scrub i got wind
of a village somewhere ahead but the
tribe had either moved on or taken to the
hills for the time being i set up shop
so to speak on the highest of a series
of broken and tumbled masses from the
cliffs a couple of miles from the v-neck

  the sun was westering and the heat
had begun to abate the valley at least
to my eyes had acquired a sinister reddish
hue in the quiet air the sounds of the on-
coming force gave an effect like the mo-
tions of puppets

  i had laid the rifle between two rocks
so that no gleam would show its presence
the rifle the shadow and i blended into
one i was amused to notice the newly
acquired caution with which the raiding
party advanced i marked the figure which
i hoped was the commanding officer
the witch-makers



etting ready to fire that rifle was
one of the hardest jobs ive ever
tackled i had no finger to squeeze the
trigger i could not hold the rifle against
my shoulder i couldnt use the sights but
id thought about all the difficulties when
i was toting it and i solved them after
a sort i drew back from the rifle and
sighted along the rock groove in which
it rested then i crawled up to it shifted
its angle and drew back for another esti-
mate until i had it aimed at a spot below
a shoulder-high rock that the column would
pass i made these preparations of course
before the detachment was in range then
i lay on my side with the stock against
my chest and the nail of a paw hooked
around the trigger

  when the man i had marked stepped
into range i fired the recoil gave a wal-
lop to my ribs the officer finished his
step raised a hand toward his ribs and
collapsed i grabbed the rifle in my teeth
and stepped into full view

  the results were electrical silhouetted
against the setting sun i must have pre-
sented an awesome appearance the whole
column halted as one then pandemonium
broke out the somalis turned retreat into
rout brave as they were they couldnt face
a panther-devil that wrote warnings and
backed them up with deadly marksman-
ship

  shouted commands were ignored the
officers shot down their own men in an
effort to stop the panic they fired at where
i had been but i had ducked

  for months to come the survivors of
that raiding party will i hope break
into a cold sweat every time they hear
a panther howl

  my lone campaign struck me as a
success but i was weary my leg ached
severely and night drew near i decided
to return to camp and see what i could
do there further foraging in my present
condition would have been simple suicidal

  when the sun was ready to drop below
the horizon i had put several miles of
the return trip behind me i traveled clear
of the jungle to make better time even

so my injured leg hindered me badly i
tried to keep my weight off it by trotting
along hippity-hop in a sort of three-legged
gait

  i glanced around when i heard the
rush of hooves a one-horned rhinoceros
was charging me like a runaway express
train at the moment of impact it flung its
lowered head skyward its horn hooked
around me hurled me high in the air and
backward that terrific heave both saved
my life and lost it i went through the
air in an arc and crashed among the
branches of a low growing tree i was
knocked unconscious but out of reach

  when i opened my eyes night had
fallen i was draped over a limb the
rhino had departed its horn had opened
a gash in my side the branches had cut
and bruised me and my right hind leg
which had already taken punishment
enough was broken

  as i jumped to earth i gave a screech
that would have brought my friend the
rhino back in double-quick time if he had
heard it i couldnt help it so fierce was
the agony all the rest of the night i spent
in hopping and dragging my way back to
camp only the memory of the emerald
drove me on growing fainter with every
step and losing blood steadily it was all
 could do not to yield to the temptation
to crawl into a thicket and die

  almost any creature that walked could
have beaten me then the jungle and all
its noises its mysterious life the strange
greenish dusk within it and the scarlet
moonlight filled me with terror the way
back seemed endless the air smelled sul-
phurous i sweltered in that infernal heat
or perhaps it was only fever that crept
over me as i toiled on the long route
fever and the slow finger of death

  in the silence that ensued burton who
had taken copious notes on the story sat
brooding for the period in which a man
could smoke a pipe finally he sighed
deeply i resent it after a fashion that
he should be first to have so remarkable
an experience he murmured by rights
you or i should have been elect

and turn you loose and i wont let you do
the job on me

  im afraid you havent the true in-
stincts of the martyr travers fame ad-
venture pioneering-they mean nothing to
you if i were dependent upon your inclina-
tions doubtless we might never have
passed this milestone on the road of human
achievement it was a stroke of genius
no less the scientific genius that is today
tearing apart the secrets of life mind and
matter

  and now that the milestone has been
reached

  on to the next burton tugged at
his beard as he glanced at the sleeper his
expression was curious a mixture of envy
of regret and of inhumanly calculating in-
tent

  he rose and began to make preparations

  travers did not finish the involuntary
phrase that came to his lips you
mean-

chapter vi

the end of the emerald god

from fever and the slow finger of
death from dreams and memories and
lost realities hidden in mists afar leif
abbot slowly returned to consciousness
he was afraid to open his eyes through
fear of what he would find through fear
that it would not be what he hoped to
find

  he recalled buala the emerald flight
through jungle the recollection was mixed
up with fever and the impression of a
nightmare in which he had somehow been
imprisoned in the body of a panther it had
been a harrowing nightmare too graphic
and vivid

  among his haze of thoughts drifted the
faces of two white men who proclaimed
themselves scientists but who mastered
demoniac arts leif abbot had an uncer-
tain feeling that he had talked to them at
considerable length but he could not
imagine what he had talked to them about

it was all hopelessly involved he tried
vainly to force the pictures into a consecu-
tive sequence

  when he blinked his eyes open and
saw his own body still lying upon the
operating table he felt only the dull un-
happiness of one who has already been
shocked into numbness assailed by fore-
bodings he looked down his head moved
with singularly abrupt and sudden jerks
when he saw the talons the thin horny
legs and the feathered body of a bird of
prey he screamed his fury the result was
a croak harsh and forbidding

  travers had left the tent burton who
was taking the pulse of the body looked
around when the eagle screamed

  awake he queried his eyes alight
with excitement another triumph a
complete success leif abbot your body
is mending but it still is not out of danger
you fortunately destroyed the black
panther by putting its body to excessive
strain you have a very courageous na-
ture but you let it run away with your
better judgment we have given you a
second temporary body you have wings
you can fly the skyways are open to
you while the spirit of the eagle is earth-
bound in your body

  when you return i trust that recovery
has progressed sufficiently so that the iden-
tity of each can be restored to its rightful
abode the cage door is not locked if you
can hear me you are at liberty to open the
door and depart return when you will but
i would advise you not to remain away
for any extended period

  leif abbot had an insensate urge to
fly straight at that ruddy face hook
his talons in the bushy black beard and
peck at the mans eves but out of the
turmoil of his emotions out of the need
for radically readjusting himself to his en-
vironment one thought stood clear an
opportunity other than the one specified
had beert unintentionally given him

  with mental prayers that burton would
not divine his purpose he used his beak
to push the cage door aside he strutted
forth and stretched his wings experimen-
the witch-makers



tally to get the feel of them by the easy
response he knew that the birds natural
motions and habits had carried over

  he struck instantly a swoop brought
him over the emerald figurine that lay
among his belongings he hovered clutched
it in his talons and sailed for the tent
flap burton lunged after him shouting
come back here drop that you idiot

  his wing-tips grazed the canvas and
deflected his course burton almost caught
up with him but his outstretched hands
just missed the eagles tail feathers

  then the bird soared

  a bullet buzzed by leif abbot heard
a loud report he squinted earthward
travers had appeared from nowhere run-
ning toward the tent he whipped out his
revolver and was emptying it at the flying
target there could be no doubt of his
purpose only the emerald could have
brought such greed to his eyes he was
willing to kill the eagle and the mortal
spirit of leif abbot if necessary to prevent
the loss of that treasure

leif abbot swooped swerved darted
in erratic arcs mounted suddenly
side-slipped nose-dived and straightened
out no ordinary marksman could have
hit so crazily veering a target only a
miracle could have enabled even a superb
shot to halt the eagle travers was not the
marksman and chance did not provide
him the miracle his bullets went wide of
the bird with his last triumphant glance
and a scream of mirthless mockery abbot
saw burton struggling to wrest the pistol
from travers a useless struggle now that
the weapon was empty

  the figurine did not weigh enough to
prove a hindrance after the first thrill of
flight and escape he forgot about his
prize he felt a stronger emotion a rap-
ture gripped him an ecstasy unlike any-
thing he had yet known

  many times during his life when watch-
ing the wild ducks fly south on the mid-
western prairies in autumn while staring
at seagulls as they circled a ship or ad-
miring the lightning-like speed of hum-

mingbirds as they darted toward honey-
flowers he had envied the birds their
winged freedom he reveled in that free-
dom now he rose ever higher his strong
wings beating the way aloft it took less
effort than he had imagined for his wings
slanted automatically to receive the full
lifting power of every gust of wind and
utilize each upward eddy

  he felt like a spirit liberated from all
earthly ties the jungle became only a
dark mass below him the landscape un-
folded toward farther horizons trees
rocks and water holes lost their indi-
viduality

  the ground evolved into masses and
areas a darker carpet for the jungle a
lighter area for the plain a sun-capped
shadow-filled mass for the mountains

  he found himself flying toward those
distant peaks that rimmed the northeast-
ern horizon in the midst of his breathless
enjoyment and elation he wondered why
his course came so easily then he re-
membered a previous experience and
guessed that the nest of the eagle lay
somewhere among those towering crags
and gorges

  he was about to change his line of
flight when his far-sighting gaze was drawn
to the puzzling actions of three birds the
birds swooped to earth in single file rose
looped over and dipped again it dawned
on him that the birds were airplanes miles
distant and their maneuvers could best
be explained if they were indulging in the
luxury of ground-strafing

  fifteen minutes later drifting at an
altitude of approximately a mile he found
his surmise correct the airplanes fast
bombers equipped with machine guns had
evidently resorted to ground-strafing for
lack of any considerable target worth
bombing he estimated the region to lie
twenty miles north of where he had met
the raiding column the day before but it
was only a guess for small landmarks
could not be distinguished at all from bis
height and the large ones he viewed from
a different perspective

  gorges basaltic extrusions lava flows


famous fantastic mysteries

and jagged hills formed the terrain as
though a giant hand had built turrets and
scattered massive blocks in random forma-
tion why any nation should want that
lonely unlovely land mystified him even
from his height however he detected tiny
ants here and there on the hilltops or
crawling from bush to bush in the valley
bottoms he heard the stutter of machine
guns and saw answering wisps of smoke
puff up from the ground now and then
one of the ants stopped crawling

  he spiraled lower the peril from stray
shots forgotten in the anger that again
welled inside of him leif abbot had more
than one contradiction in his make-up
as a footloose adventurer and trader he
had always been alert to strike a shrewd
bargain when he could but he was just
as eager to leap into fray on the side of
the underdog when someone else was taking
an unfair advantage

  still circling downward he wondered if
there was anything he could do about the
one-sided battle his intentness on getting
a closer view and his preoccupation with
means of counter-attack brought him to
the danger zone before he realized it the
song of a sky-riding slug passed too close
for comfort

one of the bombers completed its
power dive and its burst of firing
it zoomed upward for position its nose
was tilted toward the eagle leif abbot
clearly saw the leather helmets of its crew
and a surprised expression behind the
pilots goggles as he noticed the eagle
leif abbot dropped the emerald figurine
it fell straight to its target

  there was a crash and a zing glitter-
ing green fragments and a flash of gold
streaked the air it was as though the
propeller had rammed a stone wall

  the bomber leaped under its own mo-
mentum lost speed and went into a tail-
spin it plunged toward the ground from
its altitude of only a few hundred feet
the pilot frantically worked the controls
and had just got the craft straightened out
when it crashed

  all its bombs must have exploded at
the instant of impact a gigantic fountain
of flame roared up grass and bushes flat-
tened as a wall of wind rushed in the
concussion numbed leif abbot even be-
fore he felt the skyward surge the air
filled with blasted objects debris shards
of metal bits of flesh the second bomber
diving to do its own ground-strafing in
the wake of the first was caught over that
inferno tossed as by invisible hands some
hurtling missile must have struck the bomb
rack for the machine disintegrated in an-
other great geyser of flame and smoke and
erupting metal

  he never knew the fate of the third
bomber tossed around in the violent cur-
rents from those blasts he fought for
control

  then the world became quiet it seemed
to reel and grow fuzzy his thoughts be-
gan to wander how had he managed to
hear at all so far as he knew birds were
not equipped with auditory apparatus akin
to mans yet he had distinctly heard bur-
ton speak

  his wings felt sticky he wanted to
fold them in and plummet to earth it
would be so easy he could straighten out
just before he crashed-but he wouldnt
straighten out any more than the bomber
he didnt even know if he was flying in
the camps direction but he kept to a
straight line the emerald was gone why
should he go on with the treasure for
which he had endured so much shattered
into a million irrecoverable bits what
insane impulse had made him throw it
away at least they wouldnt be able to
take it away from him now

leif abbot awakened from a dream
that he had been flying through the
air and sinking toward the green shadows
of the jungle he was not at all sure that
he had wakened instead of flying he
found himself in suspension he floated
not in air but amid a denser medium he
saw the shadowy green twilight but it was
the obscurity of water not of forests

  beast bird fish-what did it matter
the witch-makers



one nightmare was no worse than another
he had survived the others and he would
live through this until the delirium left
him and he opened his eyes again upon
the world as he knew it

  try as he might he could not close his
eyes now that a measure of awareness had
returned while he was brooding he was
consciousness of somber twilight as his
thoughts became coherent he was forced to
abandon evasions

  travers and burton had cheated and
betrayed him they had used their fiendish
discovery to deprive him of his rightful
body for the third time they had locked
him up in the guise of a fish

  he tried to turn his head to see what
sort of finny creature he had become but
his head would not turn a flip of the fins
and he faced the opposite direction he
rose dived circled wriggled and spun
around until he was dizzy with exaspera-
tion his eyes could see only forward and
upward he could not turn his head

  had they placed him in the headwaters
the ground springs that formed the source
of the river he had followed in his orig-
inal flight he became aware of a gentle
lazy current and allowed himself to drift
along

  the water swarmed with life he was
appalled by what his human eyes had
missed when he had drunk of necessity at
tepid pools and streams during his years
in the tropics

  a great horror of these strange depths
overcame him he could not follow the
stream to the sea he could never watch
beneath or behind he had no weapon to
fight lurking monsters he had no desire
to find out what terrifying life-forms in-
fested the deeper parts of the river or
what rotting hulks and bones littered the
sea-bottoms once he left his present posi-
tion he would never be able to find his
way back

  a flip of the tail brought him face about
a fiercer horror assailed him but he had
no voice to cry out no time to flee a sort
of dumb and paralyzing madness quaked
through him as he saw the jaws of the
crocodile close-

  burton looked worried he watched the
body of leif abbot which was twitching
grotesquely the arms and legs made
spasmodic movements the mouth gaped
like that of a fish out of water

  the body flopped weakly all at once
with a quiver and a horrible finality

  burton sprang to his kit seized drugs
and worked for an hour in sweating anx-
iety his efforts produced no results
what happened asked travers

  i dont know im afraid the vitality
of the fish was of too low an order to
direct a highly developed and complicated
organism

  travers filled his pipe irritably he
was done for no matter what why the
devil couldnt he have left the emerald

now you sec it-now you dont officer mcguiness was not a drinking man
but the vagaries of professor zapt were one too many for an honest irish cop

ight depends upon the etheric vi-
brations which we are wont to de-
nominate light said professor
xenophon xerxes zapt the eminent in-
vestigator of the unknown sometimes
called unknown quantity zapt by his
associates by reason of the double x in
his name he spoke from the reading chair
wherein he had been browsing over the
pages of a scientific journal in the living-
room of his home

  good thing it does too declared bob
sargent fiance of the professors daughter
nellie surveying the young woman in ap-
preciative fashion if it didnt i suppose
we couldnt see a thing

  exactly the professor nodded
there are times robert when you have
a gratifying manner of perceiving the main
point of a deduction to be arrived at by the

consideration of already established facts
light being the main instrument of vision
its absence from the scheme of things
would rob us of one of the five recognized
senses beyond a doubt

  and yet said bob they tell us that
black is an absence of light dont they
professor so if theyre right why is it
we can see a negro-

  wait the professor held up a slender
hand we were speaking of light not
color robert

  bob nodded well yes but if black
is an absence of color why call the negro
a colored man

  xenophon xerxes zapt indulged in a
frown displeasure shone in his spectacled
eyes there were times when he disap-
proved strongly of nellies choice of a fu-
ture husband-when he was more than a


blind mans buff



little annoyed by the particular sense of
humor possessed by the young attorney
and now that annoyance flamed if it
were not for the facetiousness you at times
exhibit robert he said with a sudden
stiffness i would be far more satisfied as
to the amount of light contained in what
you are pleased to consider your mind
there are occasions when in endeavoring
to discuss some scientific problem in your
presence i am reminded of the saying in
regard to casting pearls of price before-er
--porcine appreciation levity is the last
characteristic of personality with which we
should approach the consideration of natu-
ral problems he reached up and began
pulling at the graying mutton-chop
whiskers on either side of his cleanly
shaven chin

  nellie gave bob a warning glance
though her blue eyes were dancing

  and sargent heeded the sign well
really professor he said i had no in-
tention of acting like the proverbial swine
just whats the notion will you explain

  invisibility xerxes zapt pronounced
the word with a force hardly to be ex-
pected from a man of so slight a frame
he was a little fellow was the professor
customarily clad as now in baggy trou-
sers a loose coat and roomy slippers in
which he went puttering about the ex-
periments that had won him a certain sort
of fame

  invisibility he repeated eying sar-
gent have you any conception robert
of all that may be embraced in that term

  why-er said bob if a things in-
visible you cant see it-like a gas or-

  exactly the professor helped him out
or the workings of some peoples brains
invisibility is the state wherein a substance
defies the operation of the visible sense
what then if instead of arriving at such
a state through the vaporization process as
in the instance of a gas substances should
be rendered invisible and at the same time
their solidity were to be maintained

  it would be rather awkward wouldnt
it sargent suggested people would al-
ways be bumping into things

  eh once more xerxes zapt eyed
him in an almost suspicious manner
well perhaps-perhaps they would rob-
ert and in that fact lies the advantage to
be gained now this article on camou-
flage i have been reading would make it
appear that camouflage depends on the
ability of man to present a baffling aspect
of ordinary appearance to the perceptive
centers of the brain through the visual
function of the optic nerve am i plain
i believe that is the generally accepted
explanation sargent assented weakly

  exactly but what if instead of chang-
ing the aspect of natural objects they were
rendered incapable of being seen

  holy smoke said bob and paused in
sudden comprehension i guess i begin
to get your notion

  xenophon xerxes zapt leaned forward
it would revolutionize the entire system
of defense which might be employed by a
nation it would enable a fleet of an army
to disguise its presence completely i think
it was known to the ancients merlin
whom tennyson mentions had a cloak of
invisibility you remember robert-my
mind is made up i am going to do it
make things invisible sargent ques-
tioned

  exactly the professor rose and shook
down his baggy trousers and when it is
accomplished i am going to give it to this
nation the united states of america is
going to be rendered-

  not invisible robert interrupted
certainly not zapt gave him a with-
ering glance i was about to say that
to xenophon xerxes zapt it was reserved
to render his nation impregnable from at-
tack

  by jove professor thats a wonderful
thing if you can do it robert exclaimed

  if-if the professor bridled just
so in all ages progressive minds have had
to contend with the doubt of scoffers
having delivered that parting shot he
turned and stalked from the room

  well-sargent looked at nellie-as
long as he doesnt render you invisible
sweetness


famous fantastic mysteries

  miss zapt glanced down at fluffy the
beautiful angora cat she was holding in her
lap tweaked one pink-tipped ear with her
fingers and-flushed

  if you dont quit making him cross
hes apt to squirt some of it on you when
he gets it finished she cautioned

  bob laughed small danger hes too
wise if he did that he couldnt tell when
i was hanging around the prettiest little
brown-haired girl in town

  and after that-well quite a while after
that-he said good night

  yet late as he departed a light still
burned in the room professor xenophon
xerxes zapt had converted into a labora-
tory of sorts on the second floor of his
home

  a month went by however before any-
thing came of the professors scheme and
sargent had put the thing completely out
of his mind then on a certain evening he
mounted the steps of the zapt residence
found the door open and save for the un-
guarded condition of the house no sign
of anybody home

  with the freedom of long acquaintance
he stepped inside and glanced around

  the sound of a soft voice calling struck
his ears fluffy-fluffy-kitty-kitty-
come here-come on and get your supper
honey drat it-where has the creature
gone

  sargent grinned in pleasurable antici-
pation and followed the sound to the rear

  wont i do as well he questioned
entering the kitchen where nellie was
standing with a brimming bowl of milk in
her hands

  oh hello bob she answered turning
toward him i cant imagine where she
is its time she was fed but she doesnt
come when i call her

  oh well shell come back its a way
with cats bob told her put the milk on
the floor where she can get it when she
does ive got something for you

  what miss zapt set down the bowl
as he had suggested and came to stand be-
side him as he produced a box from his
pocket and from the box a ring

  you said you admired it the other day
when we saw it in a window

  bob miss zapt seized it and slipped
it on a different finger from the one where
her betrothal solitaire already blazed and
then she put her arm around bobs neck
and stood on tiptoe to kiss him

  sargent met her halfway lifted his head
and stiffened a trifle and stood holding her
still in his arms until at length he let out
a slow ejaculation what th deuce
whats the matter nellie raised her
eyes then turned them in the direction his
were already staring to find them resting
on the bowl she had placed on the floor

  and that was all-except that for some
unaccountable reason-the milk was dis-
appearing even as she stood as rigid now
as sargent-its blue-white level went
down

  bob she whispered in a tensely sibi-
lant fashion do-do you see it

  thats the trouble he said rather
thickly i dont see a thing and yet-
that bowl of milk is going to be empty
pretty soon

  and then as they stood arrested scarce-
ly breathing it must be confessed in the
face of the inexplicable thing occurring
before them if they were to accept the
evidence of their senses nellies ears
caught a faintly rhythmic sound

  listen her blue eyes widened her
hand crept up and laid hold of sargents
fingers

  lap lap-lap lap the milk sank
lower and lower

  fluffy sad nellie all at once
  fluf-fy bob repeated

  yes nellie set her soft pink lips to-
gether shes there-drinking that milk
ive got to catch her but-dont you let
go of my hand

  she began to tiptoe forward and sargent
followed fluffy she wheedled softly
fluffy-honey she bent her knees and
reached out groping fingers and suddenly
she tore her hand from sargents grasp and
made a swiftly clutching gesture ive got
her she announced and straightened
where said bob a trifle blankly
blind mans buff



  right here im holding her in my
hands never mind fluffy-muddys got
you

  well- sargent accepted the infor-
mation you sound like it and you look
as if you were holding something but
darned if i can see her

  of course not miss zapts tone was
one of quickening exasperation silly
dont you understand

  no i dont bob said rather shortly
hesitated briefly and wrent on again in
dawning comprehension unless its some
more of your fathers-

  it is nellie declared with convic-
tion that invisibility stuff he was talk-
ing about last month and hes-hes tried
it on fluf-fy and- her voice began to
quiver

  good lord bob gasped well never
mind sweetheart if he did it he can undo
it where is he

  i dont kno-ow said nellie in a
fashion suddenly savage but-im go-
ing to find him and make him bring back
my cat she turned and ran out of the
kitchen into the hall that led to the front
of the house

  sargent caught up with her in a stride
for a moment he had felt shaken by the
uncanny way in which the milk had van-
ished but now that he knew the explana-
tion the whole aspect of things was al-
tered he grinned as nellie raced ahead
apparently holding nothing to her bosom
and then he put out a hand and drew her
to a stand

  listen he said

  swish swi-i-ish a fresh sound
broke upon their ears

  what is it nellie questioned as the
thing continued

  bob shook his head if you ask me
somebodys washing the front of the house
with a hose

  father miss zapt emitted the one
brittle word shook off sargents detaining
hand and darted toward the swishing noise

  bob followed-just as he had been fol-
lowing nellie ever since he knew her first
side by side they reached the front door

side by side they paused and gasped as
a sweeping spray of fluid met them
swish swi-i-i-ish again the deluge
get back half-blinded bob reached
for nellie caught her and dragged her to
him get back

  as he turned to regain the protection of
the hallway he had a blurring vision of a
slender figure with mutton-chop whiskers
and spectacle-rimmed eyes playing the
drenching liquid toward them from a length
of rubber tubing then-

  swish swi-i-i-ish the stream caught
them again-this time in the back and-
he found himself apparently still holding
nellies arm but-miss zapt had disap-
peared

  nellie he faltered it was unbeliev-
able he could touch her but he couldnt
see her

 bob-oh bob-where are you he
heard her

  right here he said as a horrible
thought laid hold upon him nellie-cant
you see me-dear

  no-o-o i can feel your-fingers she
whimpered but-i-oh bob-im so wet
and-frightened you-you just faded out
-all at once after-father-

  father yes father was the answer
sargent saw the whole thing all at once
father had decided to make a practical
demonstration of his new invention or dis-
covery or whatever one wanted to call it-
and he had started spraying the infernal
stuff on the house well-it was his house
and he could do what he pleased about it
but when it came to using the thing on
human beings-

  fathers voice cut into his swirling con-
sideration robert-am i right in think-
ing i saw you and nellie on the porch just
now

  bob turned the little man had switched
the direction of his hose and was staring
toward the house with near-sighted eyes

youre dead right you saw us he
flung back a none-too-gentle answer but
you cant see us now you turned that
confounded stream into our faces and-
why bless my soul-i didnt see you


famous fantastic mysteries

said zenophon xerxes zapt not until
it was too late-that is-then i thought
i saw you-and then you disappeared
exactly bob agreed very much as
zapt himself might have done it thats
exactly what we did

  turn around then robert the pro-
fessor advised the substance only blots
out what it touches

  we did that too we turned around
and were blotted out about the time you
gave the porch its third dose bob re-
joined and paused in consternation all
at once he became aware that he couldnt
see the porch floor or the steps or nellie
or himself about all he seemed able to
see was the little man standing there on the
lawn squirting some sort of diabolical fluid
out of the hose he now perceived came
down from the laboratory window and
without the least warning he found that
the sight filled him with a sort of quickly
upflaring rage

  in a rush he was off the porch which
seemed to be there whether he could see
it or not and flinging himself toward the
source of his and its disappearance

  put down that hose

  robert to whom are you speaking
professor zapt peered toward the changing
sound of sargents voice

  im speaking to you bob told him
almost roughly put down that hose or
turn it off or-something

  remarkable-remarkable said the
professor smiling robert i cannot see
you though i hear you plainly you ap-
pear to be actually very near me if any-
thing had been needed to clearly demon-
strate the unqualified success of my recent
investigations this-

  put down that hose bob said it for
the third time and seized the rubber tubing
in his hands

  and for some reason best known to him-
self professor xenophon xerxes zapt
chose to resist he struggled to retain pos-
session of the hose exerting his frailer
strength against that of the unseen yet
stronger man who was dragging on it he
tugged and bob tugged and all at once the

professor lost his balance and sprawled
upon the ground while the nozzle released
from his controlling guidance whipped
round like a serpent striking and drenched
him to the skin

  oh i say professor i didnt mean to
do that began bob and broke off-be-
cause apparently he was speaking to noth-
ing professor xenophon xerxes zapt had
vanished

  from the porch where she had been an
unseen watcher nellie screamed the one
word father

  sargent put down the hose and groped
toward where he had last seen father on
the ground

  father once more miss zapt was
calling

  and sargents fingers made contact with
something clammily wet and very active
that bounced away from his touch and
emitted a most irascible exclamation
there now you impudent young whelp
see what you have done

  i-i cant-professor bob stammered
straightening and drawing a hand across his
seemingly useless eyes i can hear you all
right but i cant see you

  father

  yes yes zapt answered his daughters
frantic query im-im all right my
dear

  but-i cant see you-or bob-or my-
self where are you

  here sargent where are you

  here

  why bless my soul said the professor
wed better get into the house and talk
this over nellie where are you

  right here where bob left me said
nellie in a tone of incipient hysterics

  well stay there and well come to
you sargent advised her i cant see the
porch or the steps but  can make out the
door are you there professor

  of course im here zapt assured him
none too sweetly

  then come along bob began moving
toward what was still visible of the house
feeling with shuffling feet for the vanished
steps in order to ascend them to the
blind mans buff



equally vanished porch where nellie
waited to all appearances no more than a
disembodied voice

  bob that voice came to him

  here-coming he answered and
found the steps and went gropingly up
hands outstretched before him nellie
here

  beside the door he found her she gasped
as he touched her

  its all right now he said ive got
you talk about blind-mans buff
behind him came a sound of two objects
colliding and the professor cried ouch
father miss zapt stiffened inside the
arm bob had slipped about her did you
hurt yourself

  not irreparably my dear said zapt
in somewhat sarcastic fashion and i
trust i have not badly damaged the steps
where in thunder are you

  right here by the door

  huh the sound of tentative foot-
steps came nearer all right-now i touch
you

  as a matter of fact said sargent
thats my hand youre holding but its
all the same im holding nellie wed bet-
ter stick together

  the professor grunted and removed his
clutching fingers wed better get some
place where we can locate ourselves by
means of definitely known objects go into
the living-room he said

  they passed inside at least they could
now see where they were going they
gained the door of the living-room and
passed through it bob led nellie to the
couch and seated himself beside her
father where are you she inquired
here came the voice of the professor
in my usual chair my dear i presume
you can see it at least sargent what are
you doing

  im holding nellies hand bob told
him the literal truth

  xenophon xerxes zapt quite audibly
sniffed at least said he i cant see
you

  well-youve nothing on me there pro-
fessor bob retorted heres a pretty
kettle of fish

exactly complained the protessor
if you young people hadnt interfered-
thats hardly the point now sargent
interrupted the question now seems to
be how do we get rid of the stuff

  for a time xerxes zapt made no answer
and then he sighed that is the point
robert of course he assented but you
see i hadnt gone into it fully and-
father nellies voice cut into his
confession

  see here sargent half rose and sank
back as her panic-tightened fingers held
him do you mean weve-got to stay-
like this till you think up an answer
thats it robert said xenophon
xerxes zapt in a tone he plainly strove to
make soothing i think that i had-er
-that i had better try to think

  nellie began laughing there was noth-
ing of humor in the sound it was just the
cachinnation of jangled nerves and ended
in a sob

  bob put his arms about her and drew her
head against his shoulder

  dont leave me bob she murmured
promise me not to leave this house till i
see you again

  i wont said sargent i wont leave
till your father has thought of something to
get us all out of this fix he drew his
arms tightly about her shaking figure and
held her the situation was rather eerie
to say the least he could see everything
in the room quite plainly-everything but
the professor and nellie and himself

  and yet the sound of another sigh wafted
to him from the reading chair beside the
table where presumably zapt was thinking
it was followed by mumbled words milk
-no-certainly not benzine-scarcely
ether-

  ether ought to do it sargent caught
up the suggestion you said it was etheric
vibrations that were responsible for sight
the professor grunted again but made
no further comment silence came down
again dusk had fallen the sound of
shuffling footfalls struck on sargents ears
-the snap of a switch a sudden illumi-
nation filled the living-room and hallway
plainly zapt had turned on the lights bob

listened while he padded back again to his
chair and sank into it with a creaking of
springs

  and then zapt was speaking all things
considered robert i think we had best go
upstairs and change our clothes

  simple it was as simple as that bob
saw it in a flash of course he ex-
claimed as nellie stirred in his embrace
at her fathers words that will be all right
for you and nellie but i havent any extra
clothes here myself

  i can lend you a bathrobe robert
zapt replied such a step will at least give
us an opportunity to once more establish
ourselves the solution being mainly on our
clothing either their removal or their cov-
ering with an unsaturated texture will ren-
der us visible in a major extent even if it
does not restore the visibility of our faces
and hands and of course i shall think of
something in time alcohol might do it-
exactly judging by sounds the pro-
fessor rose you will come with me rob-
ert nellie will go to her room

  come dear robert prompted and
helped nellie to her feet and then as the
fall of a heavy body followed by inarticu-
late grunts and mouthings and mumbles
came from the front porch he paused

  the sounds went on they might have
been a scuffle to judge by their nature or
they might have been occasioned by some
object trying to right itself there was a
clumping reminiscent of heavily shod feet
-the rasp of stertorous breathing-then-
phwat th divil a self-interrogation
sssh one could fancy xenophon
xerxes zapt was the source of the sibilant
warning officer mcguiness hes noticed
the house confound him quick now before
he comes inside upstairs

  in his last statement professor xeno-
phon xerxes zapt had been absolutely
right danny mcguiness large florid
irish and a careful officer had noticed the
house as a matter of course-as during his
hours of duty patrolling the street on which
it stood he noticed it and half a hundred
others every time he passed and to-night
as he approached it just after dusk and

the assumption of his tour of duty he had
noticed something about it such as he
had never beheld in all of his life

  he came to a halt and stared and then
quite slowly he lifted a massive hand and
passed it across his eyes seemingly he
was gazing upon the roof and the second
story of a house without visible means of
support as the judge of the city court was
wont to say of certain individuals brought
before him the roof and the upper story
were quite familiar danny had seen them
every night for many months since the
night he saw them first but-the rest of
the picture had disappeared everything
below that strangely buoyant part of the
structure was seemingly wiped out very
much as a drawing might have been
sponged from a slate

  hence dannys instinctive gesture to his
eyes he knew he couldnt be seeing what
they said he was he had heard of such
catastrophes overtaking a man in the past
hemi-or semi-or something like that the
doctors called it anyway a man saw only
half of what he looked at and quite plainly
he was seeing-or he wasnt seeing-some-
thing like half of professor zapts house

  he put down his hand and laid hold of
the fence that ran in front of professor
zapts yard all at once regardless of the
roof and upper story of the mansion at
which he was staring danny felt a need of
support for a moment he stood clinging
to it and then-he decided on a test
slowly he turned his vision away from the
floating superstructure of a modern resi-
dence and directed it across the street

  then he let go of the fence and drew a
long breath he could see the other side of
the street all right-all of it under such
conditions his eyes did nothing by halves
he could see the houses from top to bot-
tom the boles as well as the tops of the
street-fringing trees then-what in the
name of all sense was the answer perhaps
a temporary seizure merely-something he
had eaten maybe that had caused a pass-
ing semiblindness he turned back and
once more faced in the original direction
and stiffened before the original effect
blind mans buff



  well sa-a-y said officer mcguiness
and decided that the trouble must be with
the house and not himself he decided
also to investigate

  he knew xenophon xerxes zapt sev-
eral times before he had known the pro-
fessor to produce some odd results by his
experiments-had even profited by them to
some extent when zapt had seen fit to
hand him sundry bits of neatly engraved
paper as a mark of appreciation of the
interest danny had displayed having re-
covered from his first shock of surprise
mcguiness was half-minded that he was
facing some such condition now

  funny little feller he muttered to
himself as he went up the walk from the
gate always fussin wid some sort of
contraption lookit this now wull ye-
lookit-hull bottom of th house gone
-rest of it floatin-

  abruptly he collided with something and
sprawled forward on what felt even if it
did not look like the steps of the missing
porch

  for a moment he lay with the breath
nearly shaken out of him and then he be-
gan to feel tentatively about

  theyre here-even if i cant see em
he decided at last the conviction driven
into him by his fall and the verdict of his
groping touch theyre here but-phwy
is ut i cant see em shure now im here
ill mention ut to th perfissor tis a
dangerous state of affairs indade whin an
honest man cant see where hes goin an
moighty near breaks his neck

  whereupon mcguiness got up and felt
his way with searching feet to the top of
the steps and across the equally invisible
porch to the oblong of the door beyond
which glowed the lighted hallway it was
all most peculiar to be walking on some-
thing he couldnt see and despite him it
affected danny oddly

  phwat th divil he voiced his be-
wilderment in a heavy rumble and stiffened
in his tracks at a warning sssh

  it was a sound of caution-a sibilant
plea for quiet

  danny considered quickly his official

instincts wakened he strained his ears
the rasp of whispering came to him

  sssh is ut-whisper-whisper be gob
theres somethin moighty funny goin on
about this house danny thought the
words rather than spoke them gave over
his first intention of ringing the bell if he
could find it laid hold of the screen door
and dragged it open and stepped inside

  the hall ran straight back before him
he saw the upward sweep of a flight of
stairs to the right lay an archway giving
into a lighted apartment mcguiness turned
toward it made his way into the living-
room and gazed about him so far as he
could see he stood alone in a room other-
wise deserted and yet-dimly it seemed
to him that he detected a sound of sup-
pressed breathing

  he frowned it was like being in a dark-
ened room with some unknown person-
only this room was brilliantly lighted and
still he could perceive no one a peculiar
tingling prickling sensation began to run
up and down his spine somebody had
whispered and they must have been close
indeed for him to have heard it-some-
body or something was breathing not ten
feet from him he was sure of it now

  the pad of a careful footfall he
whirled tightening his grip on his club-
to find nothing at all-or at least no one
before his starting eyes

  xnd yet that softly padding sound went
on it was as though unseen enemies were
creeping upon him tiny drops of moisture
started on his cleanly shaven upper lip he
spun about again at a rustle of movement
from a new direction his respiration
quickened a few moments ago his eyes
had tricked him and now seemingly he
couldnt believe his ears or could he
those whispers-of breathing-of unseen
footfalls were all about him surely some-
one or something was moving in the room
something mcguiness began to lose some
of his ruddy color he wasnt a coward
but this unseen this unknown this appar-
ently unknowable thing was getting on his
nerves

  father


famous fantastic mysteries

  he jerked himself up at the sound of the
articulated word-no more than another
sibilant sighing but none the less some-
thing within his comprehension

  sssh 

  there it was again-that plea for silence
-caution-from the hallway now or else
his ears had utterly failed him

  he twisted himself toward it perfissor
-are ye there perfissor he questioned
hoarsely and advanced on legs that shook
the least bit for all his dogged effort to
control them at the worst he told him-
self now he was facing something human

  and yet when he reached the hallway
and groped along it searching searching
heavily for what he couldnt see there was
no one and-a stairboard creaked he
lifted his eyes quickly he could see the
stairs and-there was nothing on them

  all at once mcguiness found himself
shaken by something like a chill and
clenched his teeth

  aw go to th divil he snarled a grit-
ting surrender shure an i wasnt hired
to go chasin after ghosts

  a giggle-an unmistakable giggle-was
wafted to him from the second story and
yet to his baffled imagination it was the
gibbering of a disembodied something
kicking open the screen door he stepped
outside removed his helmet to draw a none
too steady hand across a sweat-dampened
forehead and took a deep and somewhat
uncertain breath then very slowly he
found the steps and went down them re-
traced his way along the walk to the street
and turned to look back at what he could
see of the house

  it was just the same as it had been only
now mcguiness knew that no matter how
it appeared the bottom part was there and
-it wasnt the same after all-there was
a light upstairs

  he regarded it for several minutes be-
fore he understood when he had gone in-
side it had not been there-and there was
that creak on the stairs somebody had
whispered father and somebody had
sshed the speaker into silence and-
somebody had giggled when he said he

wasnt chasing ghosts-and the recollec-
tion of that giggle wasnt at all the same
now as it had seemed inside the house it
had been a sound of amusement with noth-
ing of menace about it the officer was
greatly puzzled

  all at once danny mcguiness set his
irish jaw in determination begob he
declared to no one but himself im go-
in to get to th botthom of this now do ye
moind i couldnt see anywan at all at
all but-by th same token  couldnt see
th steps an yit i found thim

  jerking open the gate he found the steps
again with groping feet went up them and
reached the door and let himself once more
inside

  upstairs he told himself upstairs he
would find them he would go up and this
time hed demand an explanation sshes
would not deter him any longer there was
somebody up there ghosts didnt turn on
lights hed go up and find the lighted
room and-

  something brushed against his leg

  he started checked himself and stooped
swiftly with reaching fingers they closed
on something furry-something silken soft
-something that drew back and emitted
an unmistakable hiss

  a cat said danny a kitty dye
moind now-an i cant see her-i cant
see her any more than i could thim steps-
but-i can feel her-or i could kitty-
kitty-come here kitty still bent he be-
gan feeling in all directions turning on
heavy feet as he sought to come once more
in contact with her come kitty-come
to officer mcguiness where th divil did
you go to

  why officer such language im sur-
prised

  mcguiness straightened slowly he
glanced upward quite to the head of the
stairs-and remained staring while his
heavy jaw sagged

  because something stood there-only it
was hard to say what it was-except that
it appeared like the dress of a woman-
just that-just a dress leaning a little to-
ward him across the railing or no there
blind mans buff



seemed to be a pair of feet beneath it-
a pair of feet but neither hands nor head
there was nothing at all above the neck of
the garment save a little triangular spot as
white as-as white as a virgin reputation
and that was all there wasnt anything
else there was just that tiny white tri-
angle and a pair of feet and the dress

  so much he saw and then the dress was
joined by two other garments-a jerkily
moving bathrobe and a suit of clothes
the three formed a group and began de-
scending

  whuroo danny let the sound out of
his chest in a sighing exhalation and stood
watching but it wasnt a battle-cry of
combat-it was just the last stand of con-
scious volition and after that as the three
headless figures marched down the stairs
toward him officer danny mcguiness was
volitionally paralyzed he stared with a
never-shifting vision but he neither spoke
nor moved he was past all speech or
movement until suddenly-the ladys gar-
ment laughed

  why officer it said you look as
if you were seeing a ghost

  hope waked anew in danny mcguinesss
breast he stiffened his shaking knees the
voice had nothing of whispers of sshes
about it it had a distinctly human note
it sounded suspiciously like that of pro-
fessor zapts daughter

  shure i-i dont know what im see-
in he stammered fer th lasht fifteen
minutes uts been pretty much now you
see it an now you dont wid me miss-
but mostly dont

  of course and surely that was xeno-
phon xerxes zapts voice emerging from
the suit of clothes thats the substance
on our faces mcguiness come into the
living-room and ill explain the matter to
your better understanding

  all roight perfissor danny assented
it is yersilf isnt ut perfissor

  of course said the suit of clothes
an-th-th bathrobe danny ques-
tioned

  mr sargent said the ladys garment
  av course accepted danny i moight

hov knowed it if i hadnt been so-sur-
prised

  come on in and sit down while father
explains it the bit of rayon crepe said
and danny followed while it led him in and
gave him a chair and seated itself on the
couch at the bathrobes side

  you see officer i have discovered a
substance which applied to any object
nullifies sight began the suit of clothes

  mcguiness nodded shure i dont
know phwat nullyfies means unless you put
ut on th steps an used phwat was left on
yersilves an th cat

  exactly the suit of clothes responded
i suppose you noticed the house

  i did thot-phwat there was of ut so
far as i could see said danny  twas
that made me come in to see was i goin
bloind or phwat was ut you sshed when

i	was standin on th porch

  yes the suit of clothes replied we
were just going up-stairs to get some fresh
garments so we could see ourselves at least
in a measure they went on and ex-
plained fully what had occurred

  danny grinned when the narrative was
finished dye mean said he thot you
dont know yit phwat wull take ut off
exactly the suit of clothes admitted
in a somewhat apologetic manner

  nellie seems to be coming out of it bet-
ter than the rest of us anyway the bath-
robe suggested i can see her nose

  i-i powdered it the ladys garment
giggled

  powdered ut all at once danny
chuckled that explained the white triangle
above the garments neck everything was
coming clear at last

  but see here perfissor he inquired
turning to where the suit of clothes was
sitting rather limply in the chair beside the
table wont ut wash

  wash the suit of clothes made irasci-
ble rejoinder of course it will wash it
has to wash ive been thinking about
whether it will wash best in a solution of
naphtha or gasoline i-

  but-i was speakin of wather officer
mcguiness interrupted


famous fantastic mysteries

  water the suit of clothes literally
bounded upright why-why bless my
soul i dissolved the reagents in water
water will take it off of course here-
there was a brief pause and suddenly a
neatly engraved bit of paper was seemingly
floating just below the end of a sleeve ex-
tended in dannys direction mcguiness
youre a wonder take this as a little mark
of my appreciation of your assistance i-
er-frankly mcguiness i never before
realized that you had a scientific mind
officer mcguiness took it he rose ill
be gettin back on my beat now said he

but im shure glad to have been of as-
sistance to ye perfissor an im glad i un-
derstand th sityation or i reckon id be
spendin this here now to have a doctor ex-
amine my eyes

  well-alls well that ends well re-
marked the bathrobe

  danny moving toward the hallway
paused

  thrue for ye mister sargent an if
youll accept th suggestion-maybe besides
washin yer hands an faces ut would be
as well to use a little wather on th front
of th house
