fffrey ludd rose from his chair in
the air-conditioned welfare office in
venburg the rudimentary and only city
on venus his heavy jowled face wore an
expression of sullen rage as he stared down
at welfare officer streeter lean sun-dried
thin-lipped

   youre a fool streeter snarled the big
man youre stuck on this sweltering spot
letting yourself get burned out dried up-
what for a lousy pension at the end of
your term im offering you a chance to
feather your nest while youre here and
you havent got to do a thing for me-just
turn a blind eye thats all

  get out ludd said streeter quietly

it takes a lot to rouse me to physical
actipn in this heat but youre getting close
to it on your way im expecting my new
assistant on the next spaceliner and i dont
want him to get a wrong impression of me
he might judge a man by his acquaintances

  ludds amber eyes gleamed balefully he
seemed on the verge of hurling his massive
bulk at the coldly smiling man in the chair
but instead he wheeled about and strode
from the room a blast of hot humid air
rolled in from outside as the door slid open
then it closed automatically and again kept
at bay the sodden waves of venusian heat

  streeter helped himself to an ice-cold
drink glanced at his watch then picked up
the electroculars switched them on and
peered through them and focussed them
through the clear plastic window the per-

ft e 
  jn the middle of the battle
  adventurers found it was all
  from starving 

petual mist over the venusian landscape
was pierced by the electroculars he saw
the dull gleam of metal in the air as the
spaceliner from earth dipped flattened out
and came to smooth rest at the landing
platforms

   the side airlock in the craft opened and
the passengers emerged most of them
known to streeter-staff of ludds planta-
tion a couple of members of the venusian
provincial council old dr creel and a
young stranger

   my new assistant murmured streeter
he grinned slightly noting the gestures and
movements indicative of lively excited in-
terest then the grin changed to a frown
as ludd came into focus strode up to the
young man and engaged him in smiling con-
versation for a few minutes

   streeter put down the electroculars and
left the office walking over the soggy
ground and through the vicious heat mists
which limited visibility to less than twenty
yards ludd had gone by the time he
reached the new arrival

   youre lionel bright said streeter
and introduced himself

  thats right young bright puffed

mists

slightly golly this heat-its terrific is
is always as bad as this

   to-days about normal replied streeter
taking the young mans bag and leading the
way to the welfare building sometimes
we get really hot days still he added as
he slid open the door theres no need to
get out too much the whole place here of-
fice below and quarters above are sealed
and when you do go out youll stick to
wearing your heat-resistant suit and helmet
he eyed the young man curiously what
made you apply for this job

  a change-adventure replied bright
with a little laugh ive never been off the
earth before and i thought this would be a
whole lot better than sitting in an office
feeding figures into an electronic calculator

to make earth a paradise two
they could do to keep the worli

i

  a dventure streeter fastened on to
  the word why this is just a small-
 time town with the climate of ten african
 jungles rolled into one nothing happens
 here except an occasional breach in the
 regulations in the employment conditions of
 the venusians by the way he said frown-
 ing that fellow ludd who spoke to you
 at the landing platform hes the cause of
 most of our trouble here hes not satisfied
 with grabbing the best land around venburg
 and using the venusians to work it for him
 hes trying to get around the conditions
 awarded to the natives our job - yours
 and mine - is to see that he doesnt get
 around them hes making a fortune here
 but he isnt making it quick enough to suit
 him as you know the atomic war on
 earth wiped out vast areas of food-produc-
 ing lands rendered them sterile and now
 we rely to a great extent on the green planet
 here for the essential chlorophyll which is
 infused into our artificial food tablets

   yes of course said bright if it
 hadnt been for that requirement i doubt
 whether wed have achieved space travel as
 quickly as we did

   when a mans hungry hell do anything

 by ace carter

 for a feed commented streeter and we
 cant have atomic wars and food-not oa
 the same planet he took up the electrocu-
 lars and handed them to the young man
 take a look through that window and
 youll see ludds processing plant where the
 chlorophyll is extracted from the leaves har-
 vested by the venusians

   its a huge place remarked bright
 after looking through the electroculars it
 must have cost him a fortune

   and hes trying to get back a bigger
 fortune in return said streeter grimly
 theres been rumors that an artificial sub-
 stitute for chlorophyll is being sought h
 that happens ludds schemes will crash
 badly thats why hes so keen to grab what

 
thrills incorporated

 he can and to work the simple venusians
 to death if necessary

   that place over in that direction said
 bright swinging the electroculars what
 is it theres a wall around the grounds
 and a sort of tower above the main build-
 ing 

   dr creels place said streeter he
 was supposed to be working on the artificial
 chlorophyll but no one knows much about
 him hes a sort of mystery man here sup-
 posed to have come out from earth to get
 away from it all and do some experimenting
 in peace he was on your liner by the way
 i know but he didnt speak to a soul
 sat poring over papers and books   
 gosh the young mans voice rose
 theres a man in that little tower room
 hes looking down through the metal grille
 old doc creel looking over his estate
 smiled streeter

   no it isnt the doctor said bright 
 know what he looks like

   an assistant then yawned streeter
 come and have a drink

   thanks just a moment    hes gone
 now gone from the window anyway it
 looked sort of startling to see a human face
 up in that litlte tower lionel bright took
 his drink then he was up again exploring
 with the electroculars hes there again
 he announced i wonder  

   dont said streeter have another

drink 	

  he looks worried harassed said
 bright still looking you know it-it al-
 most seems as though hes locked in up

there a prisoner	 

   streeter laughed keep going he said
 an imagination like yours should take you
 to all sorts of interesting situations

   well take a look for yourself said
   bright reddening see what you think

   streeter took the electroculars and
   focused them the mans face was
   close a stranger to him fellow about forty
   square faced suggesting a stocky body he
   was looking through the grilled window his
   brows contracted he moved away for a
   moment then came back apparently he was
   prowling around the confined space ol that

 little tower room streeter lowered the elec-
 troculars slightly taking in the high waus
 surrounding dr creels property he
 started slightly a venusian was walking up
 and downon great splayed feet outside the
 western wall like a sentry queer queerer
 still was the sight of another venusian who
 suddenly appeared at the angle of the south
 and west wall the two natives stood to-
 gether their wide lipless mouths moving m
 conversation then they separated and re-
 sumed their pacing	 

   something is going on there bright
 remarked streeter slowly whether that
 chap is a prisoner or not i cant say but
 theres a guard been placed outside the
 waus	

   isnt it our job to investigate asked
 bright eagerly

   our job replied streeter is to watch
 the venusians to see that they arent over-
 worked or their social customs interfered
 with the humans on this planet are pro-
 tected by the security council officers
 but he went on seeing the younger man s
 look of disappointment theres nothing to
 stop us from taking a walk as far as dr
 creels place if you feel like it

   do i

    all riht get into that heat-suit first
 otherwiseyoull think youve been wading
 throueh hot water after youve walked a
 few hundred yards streeter frowned
 thoughtfully put your welfare officers
 badse on the venusians have a great re-
 spect for officials and i think  take my
 laveun he pondered a moment yes and
 a length of cord wont go amiss we maj
 manage to get over that wall and cord
 always useful in a climb 	 

   you intend to climb up to that- oe-
 an briaht excitedly

  well see interrupted streeter may
 not be anything in it but no one ever e
 down through being prepared yn -
 the two men covered by theheatre-
 sistarit material left the building md m ked
 over the warm oozing ground ahead seen
 dimly through the mist was one of the
 manv fertile valleys of ludd s plantations
 where a team of venusians their scaly arms
 working rapidly were picking the vivid
 sreen crop streeter led the way skirting the
 valley picking his path over the sodden

page 
through venusian misti

 ground the softness gave way to hot black
 rocks as they drew nearer to their destina-
 tion and then with startling suddenness the
 high stone wall loomed up through the
 shifting fog

   someone coming muttered bright
 leave him to me counselled streeter
 as a bulky figure approached the venusian
 guard stopped abruptly one long arm slip-
 ping around behind his back and returning
 with a raygun gripped in the creatures two
 fingers the black lidless eyes under the
 fiat green reptilian head were menacing but
 streeter appeared undisturbed greetings
 he said in the dialect

         

 the venusian responded and as his eyes
 fell on the welfare officers badge he
 slipped the raygun back into its holster for
 a few moments streeter engaged the venu-
 sian in conversation then the latter his
 scaly face creased in a smile turned and re-
 sumed his pacing

   what did he say asked bright curi-
 ously

   all he knows is that hes to keep watch
 on the wall and to use his raygun if neces-
 sary said streeter

   but he isnt suspicious about us-wel-
 fare officers the poor devils trust us im-
 plicitly they associate this badge im wear-
 ing with their rights and privileges and
 conditions    come along this way he
 wont be back for a few minutes ill get
 on your shoulders and when i reach the
 other side ill throw the cord back over the
 wall and you can climb over after me im
 mighty curious now about our mysterious
 dr creel

   yes he struck me as a weird sort of
 chap when i saw him on the spaceliner
 said bright didnt speak to a soul glared
 around suspiciously all the time he wasnt
 buried in his papers    youre going to
 get over here

   streeter had stopped looked around
 quickly and nodded bright bent down and
 then straightened up slowly with the other
 man on his shoulders a few moments later
 he was over the wall and had sent the cord
 snaking back

   now we are in it said streeter when
 bright joined him were trespassing and
 if our friend dr creel has any lethal de-

 signs hes more or less within his rights to
 blast us with a raygun i only hope were
 not being watched through electroculars

 rfhey walked towards the house pausing
 a every now and again to peer through
 the mist they stepped from the dark blue-
 green lawn on to a vitrified surface from
 which rose the wall of the house keeping
 close to the wall and walking softly they
 reached the tower which apparently was a
 stair-well from the lower to the upper floor
 and extending above the house to form the
 little room above

   the metal grille gleamed faintly but there
 was no one now at the window

   funny if that chap was just taking a
 look-see over the grounds from above and
 is now back downstairs chatting with the
 doc murmured streeter ouch whats
 up

   hes there said bright who had
 clutched at the others arm i just saw his
 face for an instant

   well thats something admitted
 streeter come on around this way
 theres a lower roof to the left over the
 porch we can climb on to that and then
 on to the higher roof and then we should
 be able to work around the tower
 half-a-dozen steps along the path streeter
 stopped suddenly back against the wall
 he whispered someone coming-a venu-
 sian by the sound of it

   a venusian it was the heavy thudding
 steps of the flat feet told them the identity
 of the approaching figure before it appeared
 a dark shadow in the enveloping mist

    here was no possible chance of escaping
 detection the venusian must pass within a
 foot of them if he kept to the vitrified path
 around the house the flopping footsteps
 came closer streeter tensed himself and
 even as the venusian stopped and reached
 behind for his raygun streeter had leapt
 forward and the butt of his own gur caught
 the creature behind the neck he sank
 limply to the ground

 t didnt bargain for a patrol inside the
 a wall he muttered should have 
 suppose but i couldnt see this low down
 with the electroculars come on well have
 to move quickly now there may be
 others  

page 
thrills incorporated

 using bright as a ladder streeter clam-
 bered on to the low roof after which with
 the aid of the cord he helped his assistant
 up after him they reached the higher roof
 and warily made their way to the tower
 which they approached from the rear

 he worked his way around to the front of
 the tower until he was at the window hold-
 ing to the metal grille

 hullo he called softly

 a smothered exclamation came from in-
 side and a white startled face appeared at
 the window

 its all right said streeter reassuringly
 weve come to help you i take it you re
 a prisoner up here

    yes gasped the other but how-
 well go into that later the grounds
 are surrounded by venusian guards and
 there are others just below im a welfare
 officer by the way now quickly whats it
 all about for a start youre being detained

here illegally	   

     yes yes by that villain dr creel he s

 a -

    all right call him all the names you
 like when you get out this is a job for the

security officers	a

    no-not yet said the man m frightened
 tones if creel has warning of a raid he 
 finish me off hes desperate and his guards
 and spies would warn him

    hm streeter pondered it would be a
 risk anyway to try to get out of the grounds
 just stand aside he said at length  ve
 got a raygun here ill bust this grille with
 it 

 he withdrew the gun and a softly hissing
 ray sprang from its muzzle and played
 on the metal grille the bars turned blue
 but held might have guessed he mut-
 tered theyve been impregnated against
 ordinary ray-frequencies

    what about the roof it was young

briahts voice	

    an idea admitted streeter he hoisted
 himself up with the aid of the bars and
 played the gun on the reinforced plastic

 roof thats better

    in less than five minutes he had lowered
 himself through the hole in the roof and was
 in the dim hot little room where he was
 shortly joined by his assistant

    how did you manage to find me was

   page 

 the prisoners first breathless question

   my young assistant just up from earth
 happened to spot you through the electrocu-
 lars from our office its on rising ground
 and the angle is just right for a view of this
 place we also saw the venusian guard
 and that naturally made us suspicious
 so said streeter simply we called
 thank goodness said the man fer-
 vently

   why are you being kept here asked
 streeter

   the other hesitated so long that streeter
 repeated the question i- suppose  can
 trust you said the man briefly my im-
 prisonment here has to do with-with syn-
 thetic chlorophyll

   ha dr creels rumoured to be working
 on that

   no-i have been working on it dr
 creel and his partner ludd-

   partner - ludd repeated streeter in
 astonishment

   yes theyre partners in the plantations
 here but theyve kept the partnership secret

 i have the formula for synthetic chlorophyll
 and dr creel wants it hes offered me a
 big sum for all rights to it so that lie can
 either use it to recoup ludd and himself
 from any losses in their plantations or else
 to suppress the formula altogether

   i see well now its our move

   what are you going to do

   bum the lock off the door for a start
 replied streeter then downstairs and get
 the security office on the visiphone if
 creel gets in the way thats going to be
 unfortunate-for him

   but streeter had barely time to level the
 muzzle of the raygun before he was shocked
 by a wild yell from bright followed by a
 gasping curse from the other man streeter
 spun round in the far corner of the little
 room bright was reeling back his hand
 clutching the wrist of the prisoner who was
 holding a raygun

   what the devil-

   grab the gun streeter yelled bright
 dont let him point it at you

   drop it snapped streeter pointing his
 own gun at the mans hand drop it i
 say or ill blast your hand off

   the mans struggles ceased his eyes
through venusian mists

 glared hate but he opened his fingers and
 the raygun dropped to the floor where it
 was pounced on by young bright

   at the same instant the door was flung
open and an elderly dark-faced man stood
in the opening holding a raygun before
him

ont move any of you he snapped
were armed too dr creel said
streeter coolly if you use that gun on one
of us the other will blast you where you
stand id say it was a stalemate

   the doctor lowered his gun how did
you get in he demanded he looked past
streeter at the other man you -
knowles

   just what is this said streeter were
you keeping him prisoner or not

  i the doctor staggered why of
course not this is the first intimation i had
that he was here ive had guards placed
around the house to keep him and any
other of ludds criminal associates out
and youre not ludds partner in the
plantations

  are you mad snapped the doctor
ludds been trying to bribe me to keep off
my researches in synthetic chlorophyll
naturally i refused to listen to him

   im beginning to see said streeter
softly bribing is a habit with ludd he
tried to bribe me to turn a blind eye to any
breaches in the regulations of the venu-
sians working conditions he turned to
knowles and where do you come in 
dont want any more lies by the way

   oh youll get the truth now said
knowles dejectedly i was to conceal my-
self here while dr creel was away hes
been putting a guard around his house
while he was here so ludd suggested i get
in while creel was paying a visit to earth
and hide and live on synthetic tablets for a
few days until he returned he put his
guard back on this morning but of course
i was already here i was going to get down
to-night and try to force dr creel to drive
over to ludd in his aircar-which he would
have done because my raypistol would have
been in his back all die time

   you - you scoundrel burst out the
doctor

  go on commented streeter

   ludd was going to force a deal with dr
creel if the doctor refused- knowles
shrugged

t take it youre prepared to give that as
     evidence said streeter

   yes said the other man eagerly im
not taking it all ludds the boss and hes
going to get his share

youll get yours too streeter reminded
him sharply id hate to think of what
would have happened if one of us had come
here alone or if i hadnt had a raygun
the other was silent

  he intended shooting us down as it

was went on streeter grimly turning to the
doctor but he wanted to get us inside and
off our guard and dispose of us quietly
and you thought i was keeping him
prisoner said the doctor tell me how
did you discover his presence here

   i didnt it was my young assistant here
who had an enthusiastic fancy for peering
through the mists of venus streeter eyed
his assistant by the way why did you sus-
pect he wasnt a prisoner bright i take it
you knew when you gasped and i accused
you of nerves

   he told us he was locked in the room
said young bright grinning yet when i
leaned against him as you were operating
on the lock-which of course wasnt locked
-i felt the oudine of a raygun in his hip
pocket i knew then that he couldnt be a
prisoner when he had the means of blasting
his way out i was ready for him then as
soon as he made a move i pounced on him
i said you had nerves remarked
streeter dryly ill amend that to nerve
and thanks bright

short by ron conway

  times

he wheeled round and raced for the
door    there was a sudden hashing
and hissing of light and a circular
blue beam of light shot out through
the eye-like window

   add three to two gives five and when
- a further three be suddenly added the
sum is then eight but these are mathe-
matical problems and almost certainly
seem of no account to the reader at the
moment and most certainly did not to john
co on a certain night in the spring of the
year it was later that his brain began to
be plagued with such simple scientific
problems

t

but to return june the tenth a spring
night and a time when mens hearts are
said to turn to a problem of another sort a
problem that manv including john cox
later wish they had not contemplated with
the gravity they gave to it on that tateful
night

  john was a tall young fellow broad ot
brow and thoughtful of face not the sort
one would think who could contemplate
anv problem lishtly and definitely not the
sort who would throw caution to the tour
winds with the abandon we will note when
we look in on a scene on the night ot

june -	 u

  on the edse of the town close by the
radiation research laboratories stands a
quiet old house that had been in the cox
family since before the first atomic var

it was of stone and plastic in the best style
of its period with a set of steps leading up
from a aarden path to the front porch
below looking like an evil eye the round
window of the cellar blinked out toward the

front gate

  by this gate stood two people in what
particular positions it will be needless to
state in view of the conversation that

followed	 

  i have given our relationship every
possible consideration john cox was
saving with a gravity of tone which he
thought well fitted the seriousness of the
situation i have reached the con-
clusion 

  oh john broke in a soft feminine
voice with all the allure of young love
swelling through those two simple words

page 
permutation   

dont say any more just now look at
the moon i always feel so romantic on
such a night

    must say this may john said with
obvious determination

  oh very well if you must she sur-
rendered a nervous anxiousness appearing
on her face

   thank you he replied politely i find
you most co-operative now as  was
saying  oh darn ive forgotten what
 mean is   may will you marry me
now to-night  have the license do
say yes its so dreadfully lonely in this
house at nights im the last of the coxes
and im sure were right for each other
ive thought it all out    

  may was laughing as she stopped all
those words with a truly feminine answer
she was laughing because he had taken so
long to make up his mind that she was
beginning to believe that he never would

   before he could tell her all the things
he had thought of she had him in the
drivers seat of his new  rocket car
an hour and they were waking the justice
who lived just across the border sleepily
he came out opened the door beamed
when john slipped a handsome fee into his
hand and led them inside

   his scrutiny of the marriage license was
brief and then he laboriously noted down
the particulars in his register

 john barton cox    may enid doyle
   dated this th day of june all right
now folks just step in here and well see
you accommodated next to no time and
youll be married

how right he was ten minutes later
the couple came out mr and mrs
john cox john still hadnt had time to
say most of the things he had in mind to
say but he didnt seem to care anymore as
he drove his  back to the quiet house
on the edge of town once the door closed
behind them their lives are their own for a
space of three years

   it would be pointless to guess at what
went on in the cox household but it is cer-
tain enough that others considered them a
happy couple at the laboratories johns
special piece of research pushed ahead in a

way that satisfied his superiors and his ad-
vances in salary were correspondingly good

  but we look in again on the night of
june  just three years later the second
bedroom is a scene of hustle and activity
as john paces up and down anxiously while
may lies sercnly in the bed

  wheres doc garner whats keep-
ing him he kept asking in nervous jerky
tones  graphed a message out for him
half an hour ago

  do sit down john may pleaded
quietly do sit down ill be all right
after all    well this has been happen-
ing to females ever since evolution decided
on this particular mechanism of reproduc-
tion

  the door-bell tingled tunefully and john
darted forward and in a moment had
the door jerked open to admit the bustling
fat little form of doc garner who went
straight into the second bedroom and
dumped his black bag and wheeled on the
anxious john

  get out of here he commanded

   but what    john said helplessly

  get out doc snapped go down
into that crazy lab of yours in the cellar
and fool around till were through here
ive a nurse coming along in a few minutes
stay down there till  come

  with a hopeless look toward his wife
john cox turned and went down the steps
into his cellar laboratory the door shut
soundlessly behind him and he sat down
on a stool at his bench and tried to pretend
some interest in the complicated electronic
circuit he had built around the bench and
towering up toward the ceiling lying open
on the bench was a book titled some
preliminary researches into the problem
of time travel

  after some minutes of quiet straining of
his ears to try and hear what was going
on up above he shrugged his shoulders and
wiped his glasses nervously before turning
on the apparatus the giant electronic
tubes hummed into life and a faint blue
light suffused the whole lab

  for close to an hour he checked made
alterations slight adjustments increased and
decreased power and noted his results but
he was nervous careless most of his at-

paje 
thrills incorporated

 tention was directed towards the stairs
 leading down to the lab door

   suddenly he heard the doc coming and
 he wheeled round and raced for the door
 his foot caught on a trailing lead and he
 fell there was a sudden flashing and
 hissing of light and a circular blue beam
 of light was shot out through the eye-like
 window toward the front gate then with
 a sudden flashing splash of light the ap-
 paratus fused and the room was thrown
 into darkness

   its a boy doc told him as john cox
 rushed up the stairs past the practitioner to
 see his wife

	 

 and at the gate in front of the house
 stood two people in what particular
 positions it will be needless to state in view
 of the conversation that followed

   i have given our relationship every pos-
 sible consideration the tall young fellow
 was saying a gravity to his tone which made
 it obvious that he believed these momentous
 words had never been spoken before 
 have reached the conclusion  

   oh john broke in a soft feminine
 voice with all the allure of young love
 swelling through those two simple words
 dont say any more just now look at
 the moon i always feel so romantic on
 such a night

   he was broad of brow and thoughtful of
 face and made a noise in his throat that
 might have signified anything the small
 pretty girl took a natural enough interpre-
 tation of it and slipped an arm around
 johns waist and smiled up into his face as
 she lay her head against his shoulder

   he took the girl in his arms and was
 about to kiss her when doc garner came
 bustling down the path just newly out ot
 the light from within and being a little
 shortsighted he gaped for a moment
 excused himself and went past

   say the young fellow began what
 are you doing in my house 

   dont worry him dear the girl

 plescethe doc went and the young fellow
 acted with precision and alacrity then he
 cleared his throat again but perhaps we
 should leave them there to their privacy

 a few moments later the girl helped john
 behind the wheel of the rocket car
 standing at the kerb and she smiled happily

   just like you to surprise me like this
 youve sold the  and bought this new
 model she laughed

   uh yes yes stammered john too
 surprised to say anything more as he tried
 the controls on this rocket car which he had
 never seen before but with a desperate
 grin he set it in motion and they moved on
 together away from the house

   less than an hour and they were waking
 the justice who lived just across the border
 sleepily he came out opened the door
 beamed when john slipped a handsome
 fee into his hand and led them inside
 then the bald amiable justice gave them a
 toothy grin and scatched at his pate iu
 consternation

   say he asked worriedly havent i
 seen you two before got a good memory
 for faces  have

   im afraid not john told him pre-
 cisely you see im the last of the coxes
 what with all the radiation deaths these
 days it wasnt hard to be the last of a line
 he took the marriage license and read it
 laboriously noting the particulars in his
 register

   john barton cox    may enid doyle
    dated- this th day of june say
 this here is dated just three years ago
 took your time didnt you mister

   three years 

   why john laughed the girl blushing
 and youve kept me waiting all this
 time

   john made some rapid decisions he
 decided that hed best keep quiet about the
 mistaken date on the license it seemed
 to please may the way things were but
 the justice still scratching at his head and
 muttering finally decided

   just step in here and well see you
 accommodated all right now folks
 next to no time and youll be married

   ten minutes and mr and mrs john cox
 stepped through the door and headed
 toward the waiting rocket car john
 headed his car back to that house on the
 edge of town--his house the house that
 had been in his family since before the
 first atomic war and he the last of tht

coxes proudly carried his young bride
across the threshold into the privacy
he might have wished

   oh john may cried happily as he sat

	her down youve hired servants for me
i just knew you would listen to their
baby crying im sure its such a darling
what a surprise

   but may   john tried to say some-
thing

   but may being a woman didnt really
think he could have anything important to
say if it had to be said in that tone of voice
so she interrupted him with a dutiful kiss
and they were embracing in the hallway
when a white-gowned nurse hurried from
the second bedroom and stopped dead in
her tracks

   well she said her tone expressing the
whole pent up force of her indigation
mr cox well i never and with your
poor wife having just gone through agonies
for you a son a son to a man like
you

but her indignation was too great to
allow her more words and she stalked
off in the general direction of the kitchen
may looked at john for a long moment
and then laughed at his perplexed face

  she doesnt seem to approve of you
leaving me stand here she giggled
perhaps we should 

  she paused in a modest fashion and
john looked toward the main bedroom and
grinned weakly

   no he said anxiously dont sup-
ose it is very right of me you run along
n want a word with  with that woman
efore i go to bed

   silly the girl laughed let it wait
till morning

   she took his arm and together they went
intothe main bedroom and the door closed
behind them in a moment the girl gave
a squeal of delight as she opened a drawer
of her dressing table and saw the neatly
arrayed clothing

why john she cried happily rushing
to him youve thought of everything
however did you manage to buy them
i   well he stammered in amaze-
ment

  the whole situation was beyond him
he couldnt understand he made a mental
note to call and see doc garner and have
a check perhaps hed been pushing him-
self a bit too hard lately

and in the hall john cox was climbing
the stairs with a disgustd expression on
his face all that work and equipment
ruined just because he didnt watch where
he was going still he thought it could
have had serious repercussions those
circuits were tricky in the hall he met
the nurse hurrying out from the kitchen
and she stopped and stared at him with
an acccusing expression to her face

  if it werent for your wife and baby
she began id leave this house this very
minute the idea your wife giving birth
to your son in the second bedroom and
you making love to another woman in the
hall the idea

  but    but    surely   was all
the consternated john cox could gulp out
before the nurse had stalked into the second-
bedroom to attend to the wants of the
newly arrived baby

  he followed the nurse into the room and
made pleading gestures at her but she
ordered him out as she made the sleeping
woman and the baby comfortable then
she settled herself down in a chair to keep
watch through the night john cox
shrugged his shoulders and turned and left
the room he made a mental note to see
doc garner and get a new nurse this
one was most certainly mad-not someone
he wanted to trust his son with

  deciding that he couldnt sleep he went
back down to the cellar to clean up and
leave things tidy so that he could set up
some new experiments when hed decided
on a possible field of enquiry one thing
he was sure of he was finished with time
travel that fellow korenz was obviously
looking for the impossible when he sug-
gested that a way may be found to travel
through time

  next morning he climbed the steps
wearily into the hall to shower before
hurrying off to the lab as he approached
the door of the bathroom it opened and
may cox stepped through he stopped
stood there and stared in horror he
couldnt understand it last night

 and now there she was up and about and
 looking just as pretty as that first morning
 of their honeymoon suddenly his surprise
 vanished and sheer anxiety took its place

   he rushed to her side and threw an arm
 around her

   darling he said are you all right
 you shouldnt be up and about not   
 not after last night

   but john the girl said in surprise
 why ever not

   well because you shouldn t it isn t
 every day a woman has her first   

   goodness mrs cox cried the nurse
 as she rushed in upon them from the
 kitchen what are you doing out ol
 bed

   but    began the girl in startled
 wonderment

   leave her to me completely to me
 commanded the nurse as she took mrs cox
 from the man you get about your busi-
 ness

   unhappily john headed for the bath-
 room the door closed behind him as
 it did so there came a sound of boiling milk
 from the kitchen and the nurse gave a
 shriek and run

   my goodness she cried the milk
 you stay right there

   chuckling may cox went back to the
 main bedroom and slipped back into bed
 with a greater feeling of importance than
 she had ever known in her life before
 when a moment later john cox came into
 the room with a towel around him she
 giggled and hid her head beneath the bed-
 clothes

but thoueli she waited for several
minutesshe didnt find her husband
coming to her side and when at last she
peeped from the bed she was just in time
to see his figure disappear out the door
into the hall

   well she said  like that all that
 fuss and then he doesn i say a word

   but before she could be really annoyed
   her husband came through the other door
   carrying a small tray and coffee things

   hah he said inanely youre awake
   ive made cofiee on the small stove upstairs

that enormous kitchen out back scares me
got to look after you you know

but   may began but then
changed her mind and decided to humor
him he seemed upset this morning
perhaps he was worried about taking time
off from the lab something must be wrong
to explain his strange behaviour

why did he keep changing his clothes
first-that lab outfit then-well then a
towel now he looked as if he had just
climbed out of bed and slipped into a
dressing gown but may wasnt the only
worried one john was trying to work out
why his wife had been able to anticipate
hisproposal the previous night she must
have been very sure because she had gone
to the extent of hiring a servant as a sur-
prise for him but before coffee was over
they were both laughing and happy

   then perhaps a half hour later they
strolled arm in arm out the door and went
up the stairs john was proud of the house
and was showing his bride over room by
room when they came back to the foot

	of the stairs they came up against the nurse
who stopped and gaped at them

   up and down stairs of all things she
snapped angrily the morning after  
and you take her up and down stairs

   my wife is feeling perfectly well john
replied tartly and ill thank you to be
civil

   well the woman steamed as she spun
round and headed back to her second bed-
room where she gathered up her things from
the chair by the door and stalked out of the
house slamming the front door behind her
never had she been so insulted and the
tears of rage in her eyes were such that
she hadnt dared tryand look at the help-
less young baby she was deserting

   in the second bedroom john cox looked
up from his wife and son long enough to
catch a glimpse of the nurse hustling out
the door with her bag

   we seem to have lost our nurse lie
said in a relieved voice i cant say im
not glad shes been saying the strangest
things ill send a graph to doc garner
asking him to get us another

   i feel so well i think we might- save by
not having one now may replied gently

   and this john cos was telling his
wife just outside the door is the second
bedroom in this famous room have been
born a whole line of coxes since the house
was built before the first atomic war

   arm in arm the young couple strolled in
together then four people stared at each
other in shocked surprise the men looked
from the women at their sides to those
opposite and then back again then the
wives of these men were looking from man
to man in horror

   what the devil    john cox began
starting up from the bed and advancing on
this intruder but then he stopped suddenly
and his mouth fell open as he stared at
that same face hed been seeing in his
mirror every morning sincc he first started
to shave

   for more than a minute not a sound was
heard in the room then the older man
managed to ask weakly

   who are you

  john cox and who are you came
the reply

   john cox

   but you cant be snapped the younger
man stepping up beligerently toward the
other this is some fool game a prank
to ruin my honeymoon

   nothing of the sort snapped llie other
 youre an impostor

  ask my wife the younger man
snapped

   who is he demanded the older man
of the girl standing

   john barton cox she smiled happily
we were married last night

   june  the older man said slowly
so were we-three years ago

   then what the devil arc you doing in
my house demanded the younger man
angrily

   our house cried the woman in the
bed

   you keep out of this may snapped in
replv its johns house

   wait a minute the older man began
slowly you were married last night
tune  you proposed to this girl at the
front gate she is may i presume then
you drove over the border and were
married by a justice named bently wills

  yes thats true snapped the
younger man but what has that to do
with you

  lots he said thoughtfully you see
  he paused you see youre me
your wife is my wife

   ill be damned if she is snapped the
younger man stepping forward angrily

tust a minute pleaded john cox the
j elder let me explain before you
were married you were interested in the
works of korenz and his rime travel
hypothesis you intend to set up experi-
mental circuits in the lab downstairs in
three years time youll be tinkering down
there wailing for the doc to come and
say its all over youll have a son youll
trip and the circuit will go wild that
accident will produce the effects koren
dreamed of-time travel it will swing
the you of three years ago into the present
that is what happened last night

  the younger man stood silently  for 
time and then he shook his head in dis-
belief oii mean to say that im you as
you were three years ago that may and
 have been swung forward into our
future

  precisely nodded the older man
think didnt you notice anything strange
about last night

  heavens of course nodded john
cox the marriage license dated three
years ago the strange model car the
clothes for may i think    its astound-
ing

  they talked for more than an hour and
i he men settled it between themselves and
agreed that since they both had equal right
to the house they would share it and john
cox the elder agreed to see that john coxj

fags
thrills incorporated

the younger secured a position at the
laboratories there it was agreed they
would be brothers

  and it seemed that all was settled until
john cox the younger began to get the
itch to tinker in the cellar that wasnt the
beginning but it was what brought on the
crisis in the cox home for every day the
older couple had watched the younger pair
living out their past step by step and they
laughed and chuckled over their mistakes
and quarrels but with the younger man
bringing home equipment for the cellar
laboratory the aspect of the case took a
sinister turn to the older man the pros-
pect was ominous

  that night he faced his younger self over
the table after dinner and he spoke quietly
as he said

  john youve got to stop playing about
with that korenz circuit its dangerous
dont you see what youre doing dont
you understand youre like a shadow
coming three years behind doing the things
i did just as i did them dont you see
youve got to stop

  my johns no shadow and hell live his
own life not some silly way you want
to make him the younger may snapped
irritably and the older woman smiled in
understanding for she knew mays secret

though the argument went on it was
useless with john cox the younger
determined to do as he pleased without
interference at last in exasperation the
older man blurted out

  cant you sec he growled in three
years from the day i married there were
two of us and if you keep up therell be
another one of us shortly work it out
man dont be such a fool assuming no
other influences at work work it out i
have a thousand times a million two
five eight eleven    twenty-four years
and there are seven john coxes seven
and seven wives and six children work
it out man youve got to stop this
house wont hold twenty people

  youre a fool cox the younger man
snapped im living my own life if you
think im going to be fool enough to make
every stupid mistake you made you can
forget it and just remember once and
for all-it do as i damn well like

  that threw a blanket of armed truce
over the cox household until the night of
june  then for reason of the fact that
it was three years since the younger couple
had been married and six since the older
had done the same thing they were having
a private party in the cox household

  for the first time in some months things
looked as if friendship could be restored
between the men but the older man was
gloomy and every movement the younger
woman made only seemed to make him
more and more suspicious every once in
a while he would ask anxiously after her
health and when she replied each time

  im feeling wonderful john he would
relax back into his chair with a sigh per-
haps he had been wrong

  but with the hour creeping around to-
ward eight the younger woman turned pale
and her husband was at her side immedi-
ately quickly he helped her into the
second bedroom and rushed outside to
send a graph to the doc garner as he
turned away from the instrument he saw
the older man jamming his hat on his head
and stalking out the front door

  heh john he called dont walk out
on me now

  ive been through this once before
called back the man a cynical smile twisting
his lips

  in the second bedroom john cox paced
up and down anxiously while his wife lay
serenely on the bed

  wheres doc garner whats keeping
him he kept asking in nervous jerky
tones i graphed a message to him half
an hour ago

  do sit down john may pleaded
quietly do sit down shell be all right
after all    well i went through this
once you know

the door-bell tingled before johncould-
say anything and he plunged out to
open it to the doc who bustled in and went
straight to the bedroom and dumped his
black bag and then wheeled on the anxious
man who stood close beside him

  get out of here he commanded

  but what    john said helplessly

  get out doc snapped go down into
that crazy lab of yours and fool around
ill call you when im through dont make
any mistakes this time

times permutation

   with a hopeless look toward his wife
john cox turned and went down the steps
into the cellar laboratory the door shut
behind him soundlessly and he sat down on
a stool at his bench and tried to pretend
some interest in the complicated electronic
circuit he had built around the bench and
towering up toward the ceiling lying open
on the bench was a book titled some pre-
liminary researches into the problem of
time travel

   after some minutes of quiet straining of
his ears to try and hear what was going on
up above he shrugged his shoulders and
wiped his glasses nervously before turning
on the apparatus the giant electronic
tubes hummed into life and a faint blue light
suffused the whole lab

   for close to an hour he checked made
alterations slight adjustments increased
power and noted his results but he was
nervous careless most of his attention was
directed towards the stairs leading down to
the lab door

   suddenly he heard the doc coming and
he wheeled round and raced for the door
his foot caught on the trailing lead and he
fell there was a sudden flashing and
hissing of light and a circular blue beam
of light was shot out through the eye-like
window toward the front gate then with
a sudden flashing splash of light the ap-
paratus fused and the room was thrown
into darkness

   its a boy doc told him as john cox
rushed up the stairs past the practitioner to
see his wife

	 

john cox the elder had been gone
from the house for more than two
hours when he at last returned he was
grinning with a devilish sort of delight and
as he stepped from his car a further array
of cars pulled to the kerb behind his and
soon the street was busy as the workers
hustled into the house with their loads and
returned for more

   he refused to tell anyone what it was all
 about but had the soundproof doors lead-
 ing into the second bedroom securely shut
 so that no possible disturbance could be
 caused to the new mother who was proudly
 admiring her son

meanwhile other things had come
to pass as the reader will no doubt
have remembered across the border a
young couple were stepping from a justices
place and they seemed well content with
themselves

  mrs john cox she murmured hap-
pily i so want to be somewhere alone
with you

  the tall young fellow broad of brow
and thoughtful of face looked down into
the eyes of his bride and smiled

  it wont be long now may he promised
her well be back at the house in less
than an hour and then    well we can
have all the time there is alone if we
wish

  that thought seemed to please her well
enough and she became a danger to his
safe driving on the way back across the
border to that old house by the edge of
town once the door closed behind them
their lives became a bedlam

   when- john cox the eldest really deter-
mined to do something he let no expense
get in his way and the chaotic sounds of
revelry which greeted the bride and groom
was something of a surprise for them a
host greeted them in the hall and welcomed
them home and then escorted them into the
spacious living room where a table was set
for the wedding feast

  how wonderful you are may cried in
amazement such a surprise-and all your
friends here to welcome us oh john
behind his curtain john cox the eldest
cursed silently as his paid guests took their
places for the banquet when he saw the
expressions on the faces of mr and mrs
cox he began once mort computing the
sum of two plus three plus three plus three
till his brain reeled and then he silently
crept away to his attic room where he
could worry in peace over his treatise on
the inevitability of patterns  he had
some good material on hand  

	 

certain adjustments were naturally
necessary in the cox household but
altogether the young couple took it pretty
well and even john cox the eldest took
it well-until the youngest john cox began
to tinker round in the cellar

conquerors from

a great day had arrived for those
aboard the space ship hope the day
when the ship was to return to earth the
day when the chosen few were to go back
and take up life and repeopie the lands
again a day that had been looked forward
to since the ship had first soared off into
space twenty-five years before

  some sadness dwelt in the hearts of those
aboard for they remembered that professor
dale the man who had made their escape
possible had not lived to see the day he
had worked and planned for through those
five horrible years of total atomic war upon
the earth greed and lust for power had
driven the two great nations of the earth into
an all-out struggle for supremacy

  atomic bombs were dropped in thousands
and the dust and radiation were carried on
the winds lill it slowly drifted across the
lands in a creeping death that killed all
things that came in contact with it one
man had forsecn this and he alone was
ready for the day when earth would be no
longer tenable all his great wealth and col-
losal genius had been turned toward that
one task-the building of the huge ship
hope

  in his plans he had included space for
all things living that would be necessary
for the re-establishment of life on earth
for the rest the ship was almost a tiny
land in herself the great atomic jets gave
her power and the dynamos purred inces-
santly in their tasks of maintaining the in-
tricate systems by which the small colony
of people had been able to live foi- twenty-
five vears

  now the endless days of floating in space
were passed and checks had shown that the
earth was once more safe for men safe
too for plant and animal life

  perhaps its better this way elvin dale
said quietly when he had completed his
plans with his staff of advisors had the
effects of the radiation been less severe less
all-embracing men might have been able
to maintain life on earth that could have
been worse than death with mutants of a
million sorts springing up all over the earth
and no uniformity remaining among men
now we can start again start with all the
experience and knowledge of the past to

aid us we can begin life anew and grow
in the way of peace and scientific freedom
my father dredmed of

  the son of the famous professor was a
short stockily built man with a large intel-
ligent head and small eyes his face had
the peculiar tan common to all those aboard
the hope synthetic sunshine beamed from
the lighting fixtures at appropriate hours
of the day and supplied the necessary pro-
perties of the normal sunlight they had not
seen since they had been rocketed into
space from a dying earth

  what a shame your father didnt live
to see this day moreen fleming said
quietly he would have been proud when
the earth is peopled again they will reinem-
her him-always and what an earth it will
be this time with all those creatures that
were a plague on man wiped out and only
those of your fathers choice remaining
a new utopia will be born

  elvin smiled at the girl what she said
was true but he always found her en-
thusiasm amusing it was so typically a part
of the feminine world as he knew it from
his reading yet with that quality there
went a tall slim figure and laughing eyes
which could glisten mischievously as she
tossed her red hair that she was on his
special advisory council was sufficient proof
of her standing in intelligence and learning

  with elvin watching the controls care-
fully the great ship came down through the
atmosphere of the earth and scientists kept
careful check to make sure that their pre-
dictions concerning the atomic radiations
were correct as they came down slowly
closer and closer to the earth they were
jubilant for there was now no trace of the
dread scourge left

to their surprise certain forms of plant
life still survived and they began then
through powerful viewers to make a care-
ful check for signs of animal life they
could find none and by mid-afternoon they
had come to a final decision to land and
send a scout party out to check the city

  three hours later this party returned with
one member missing once in the city they
had split up and gone in various directions
according to a plan when all but the mis-

 back to rebuild the
 world came the survi-
 vors of the atomic de-
 vastation  but first
 they had to wipe out

 wanted to undermine
 civilization quicker
 than they could build

sing man had reported back the whole party
made a search for him but no trace could
be found

  we wont worry elvin dale decided
quietly from these reports he can come
to no possible harm shut the hatch for the
night and well commence landing opera-
tions at dawn

  with the dawn of the following day the
hope was a scene of unsurpassed activity
as the well-trained groups of workers went
about their tasks of getting the precious
loads of life from the ship and back to
earth with specially designed rocket cars
moving into the city with their loads the

operation went on with that smoothness of
co-operation that only long years of en-
forced living in the hope could have at-
tained

  but though the settlement was established
by night-fatl and the plans already set in
operation to bring the city back to life
there was no sign of the missing scout he
had vanished completely and without trace

  could the missing scout have returned
he might have told them more but from
the moment he had been captured and
dragged away lie was lost to the people of
theearth deep below the city there was
cxcitement almost beyond belief as the

pac 
thrills incorporated

captive was dragged into the presence of the
ruler

   for a long time the ruler stood and stared
at the shrinking prisoner and then uttering
a horrible shriek he leapt forward and up
and sank his teeth deep into the throat of
the scout shrieking dancing leaping about
the company formed into patterns and with
ritual devoutness they followed the lead of
their ruler

   before long that horrible feast was ended
and the broken bones were dropped into
the murky stream which flowed through this
central meeting place of the sewer-dwellers

  when there was more quiet the old ruler
sat apart from his fellows and seemed deep
in thought finally he announced

  we must have more of this food i find
it good we are cunning and must be care-
ful since we became cunning as we are
there have never been such times as these
such food is precious and we must act care-
fully

  the company seemed to agree but mostly
they just accepted the orders of the wise
one he was older than they and more
cunning and his memory went back a long
way his fathers fathers father had been
of the first to be born with great cunning
and always they had been rulers-the
clever ones

  so for many weeks they did nothing but
keep watch until the leader could wait no
longer and he led a party out from their
fortresses and they waited for a lone man
to come their way when at last a man
came hurrying down the street they attacked
quickly and overpowered him and vanished
down in the hidden banquet hall another
primitive ritual feast was eaten that night

  above another man was reported mis-
sing and elvin dale ordered a thorough
investigation to be made there was some
treachery in the city-something they had
not yet faced it worried him

  i wouldnt worry moreen tried to
soothe him its just that the outside is
so inviting curiosity leads them away to
investigate ive felt the urge myself

   perhaps he admitted quietly perhaps
its that

but when four others had disappeared
without trace in the next four days
elvin no longer believed moreens sugges-

tion he called a council meeting and the
matter was discussed the result was that
the edict was issued that at all times people
were to be at least two together this
seemed to be successful for now three days
passed and nothing happened no further
disappearance was reported

  but below the city another council meet-
ing was held and the cunning ruler grinned
evilly

  they move in pairs now that is more
difficult but i have plans for us ever since
the creeping death left the earth i have
thought we should leave our dwellings be-
low the city and live above one thing had
been against this-food now we must go
up and conquer these strangers and then
we can establish ourselves once more food
will no longer be a problem

  at first the ruler sent out larger parties
and in this way they brought two captives
back from each raid and many were the
savage feasts held in their banquet hall
but as time went on this new and wonder-
ful food became more difficult to get and
the old ruler himself made a spying tour
through the city and even out to the out-
skirts where the land was blossoming with
crops and the live-stock were fattening

  for two days the cunning ruler hid and
watched the activities of the men and he
saw that they worked and fed the herds and
that some of the fattest of the stock were
killed and taken away curious to discover
what happened to these he made further
searches and found where the carcasses were
cut up and taken away once more and
then at last he discovered that they were
eaten by the men who had come from the
strange ship from the sky

  slowly a plan was forming in his cunning
brain and when he returned to his people
he revealed this plan to them	n

  the numbers of these strangers are few
he began in his owti language and we are
many if we feast from them as we will
then soon there will be no more these
strangers are clever ones they grow their
food and kill only those who cannot pro-
duce others we too must learn to work
and feed our captives that they may have
off-spring which we can eat this way we
will have a stock of food for ever never
again will there be great famines during
which we are forced to turn against our-

page 
conquerors from below

selves and fight with only the strongest sur-
viving

  the plan is a most clever one a wise
old companion replied but what do these
strangers eat

  the seed of the grasses they grow and
many other things the old leader replied
nothing that will be too hard for us

so the raiders thereafter brought down
the females of the strangers and work-
ing parties brought food for the frightened
cowering captives at first they wouldnt
eat but finally hunger forced them into ac-
cepting the food their gaolers brought them

  but the old leader puzzled for no young
were born to his captives in many weeks
and he at last perceived that they were not
as his people and so he ordered that two
male prisoners be taken to place with the
females this was done two nights later and
his working parties toiled under his orders
to keep their prisoners fed

  meanwhile elvin dale was reduced to
sleepless nights for all his plans to tap some
source of information on the mysterious
disappearance of his people had failed one
third of the number of his settlement were
already vanished without a trace

  then through hours of discussions the
council of the settlement argued the ways
in which the losses they had been suffering
could be halted but despite all their sug-
gestions they left the meeting with solemn
faces and worried brows

  but arms failed to prevent the inroads
of the enemy on the numbers of the settle-
ment week by week more people vanished
panic began to seize the remainder flight
was the only course open to them now but
when the council met again and a vote was
carried to this effect elvin dale told them
quietly

  it is now too late our numbers are so
reduced that we havent sufficient to pro-
vide even an emergency crew for the hope
we have no choice but to remain

  this news was greeted with a solemn
silence from the awed gathering

  then we must move to another site
demanded one quickly

  you all know that whatever our enemy
is it is extremely intelligent dale replied
softly are we to suppose it would not
follow us

  there was a scoffing tone to his voice

which successfully silenced any further sug-
gestions from the council but none of them
fully realised just how intelligent their
enemies were

  to the cunning old leader of their
enemies it was as if a new life were suddenly
opened to him he spent much time in
and around the city spying on the settle-
ment workers using every cunning trick
he knew to remain hidden as he watched
the work going on he realised the possibil-
ities of such a way of life and he learned
much all that he learned he taught to his
chief followers

  finally the leader decided that it was
time to make an open assault on the settle-
ment and completely overpower it and begin
the life he had been planning for his people
so that when night came again his legions
crept from their haunts and into the streets

   success came easily at first as their sur-
prise attacks brought them captives as they
had done in the past but above the city
a rocket car was prowling and a beam of
light splashed down on to the streets and
elvin dale peered down through the power-
ful viewer and caught in the white patch of
light he could see his enemy dragging away
yet another victim

  good god he gasped out in horror as
he watched them scuttling away something
we didnt think of the sewers deep under
the earth and protected from the outside
once the system was stopped

  what is it moreen asked quickly
shrinking away from the horror registered
on the face of her companion

  look he said

  she hesitated for a moment and then
took one look before she turned back to
him her face pale and contorted by what
she had seen

  how horrible

  interesting though he murmured
quietly from what ive read of them they
always possessed a cunning but some freak-
ish mutation must have risen and survived
to produce the level of intelligence they
have shown weve got to act quickly this
looks like an open attack alert all patrols
signal a general warning order all women
and children fortressed in their homes
weve got to wipe these horrors out wipe
them out completely

   to think they could survive to conquer
us moreen said disbelievingly

  but by the time the orders had been
flashed through on the general network
and the patrol cars made ready the streets
were swarming with the deadly enemy
which had appeared in force from below
from the air it was easily seen that they
were functioning under a strict discipline
and leadership as they moved methodically
in to the assault on the few buildings where
the entire remaining settlement was housed

  when elvin commanded the first swoop-
ing attack on the forces in the streets the
lines broke as the deadly blast of fire-balls
crashed from the patrol cars down into
them but before any real damage was done
an order must have been given for they
broke into small parties and scuttled for
the shelter of the nearest buildings

  many were charrcd to nothing by the
fire-balls before they could reach the build-
ings but most escaped

  land elvin ordered quickly weve
got to attack on foot

  swooping down the patrol rocket cars
settled in the streets and the force of men
massed behind elvin every man holding an
atomic fire-ball gun quickly elvin split
his force into four parties and appointed
leaders then whichever way the enemy
came from they found a force advancing
toward them with those deadly balls of
flame shooting out from the guns the set-
tlers carried

   retreat the cunning old leader ordered
his army we cant get close enough to
them to fight retreat

though these words sounded like noth-
ing more than shrieks to the advancing
force of settlers the enemy army under-
stood and they began fleeing away from the
scorching blasts that were crashing among
them with a deadly precision through all
the streets of their pursuit the streets were
littered with their bodies and here and
there an occasional mangled body of a
settler told where they had fought back
for a moment

  back and down into the sewers they re-
treated and elvin sighed his relief as the
last of them vanished then suddenly he
was snarling angrily as he saw a further
party making their cscape and he saw too

why his men were not firing the horrible
foe was dragging moreen fleming with
them as they fled she was their captive

  after them screamed elvin fiercely
to -the vents well follow till theres not
a one of those swine alive

  some of the patrols were reluctant to
go down into the great system of canals and
passageways which was the deep under-
ground channels of the sewerage system of
the great city but when elvin led the way
they fought down after him and a great
beam of light splashed out ahead of them
as they blasted a path through the back-
most ranks of the enemy

  leave nothing alive came elvins
angry order

  but even in this emergency the cunning
leader of the attackers was not without a
plan and he fell back toward the huge under-
ground cavern where he had housed all
the prisoners who remained of his captives
there he decided to make a stand with
the remnants of his force

   blasted savagely by the settlers the great
hordes which had descended on the city
had been broken up into smaller groups
and less than a quarter of the survivors
managed to get to the gaol the sewer canals
ran deep in blood and carried the heavy
tang of burnt flesh where the carcases
were floating away to the outlet far out
under the sea

   at the vast cavern the forces halted and
elvin gasped in horror as he surveyed the
scene before him men women children
whom he new personally cowered back
in the clutches of the gaolers and the re-
maining force of invaders stood in tight
ranks before them for experience had al-
ready tausht the cunning leader that the
fire-balls did not blast when a captive was
near so he marshalled his forces around
the captives and waited

   he did not dare order his legions out to
attack though they outnumbered the men
from above by twenty and more to one
he began a slow retreat into the inner re-
cesses of the sewers always keeping a line of
captives close to the rear-guard so the
slow retreat went on with elvin watching
and puzzling every time he caught sight
of moreen he wanted to hurl aside his
deadly atomic fire-ball gun and rush in
and attack with his bare hands

page 
conquerors from below

  knowing however that such a move
would be futile and end in bis own capture
he had other plans and he snapped his com-
mand

   six of you return above and come back
with weapons anything knives primitive
swords anything capable of killing

   the patrolmen hurried away and the cat
and mouse game continued with the retreat-
ing horde dragging their captives with them
and the snarling angry men following as
they watched the brutal treatment being
meted out to their friends and women who
were the captives of the deadly enemy

for more than an hour this slow retreat
went on and elvin anxiously waited
for the return of his men at last they came
they carried a curious assortment of
weapons gathered mostly from the museum
of primitive arts when these had been
handed round there were still not enough
to go round and elvin commanded those
who still remained only armed with fire-
ball guns to stand guard and fire if the posi-
tion got out of hand

   then he with his primitively armed
force moved forward and the cunning old
leader of the enemy became filled with fear
and shrieked his order for a sudden swift
retreat but before the headlong flight had
gone more than a hundred yards they were
trapped in a dead-end canal and therethey
milled in a great horde for a time before
their leader could get them organized into
disciplined lines which he commanded to
 attack

   the first of them charged forward in a
vicious shrieking wave which elvin met
with a swinging sabre fiercely he slashed
back and forth as the foremost of the enemy
reached him leaping up for his throat and
snarling their rage and hatred

   blood flowed as the patrolmen fought
savagely back and enemy dead lay all
around once elvin went down and was
buried for the moment beneath the horde
of vicious creatures who dived to attack him
but swishing blades drove them off and
elvin got to his feet with blood streaming
from his wounds

   scarcely had that first wave been beaten
back than another followed the sabre
smashed in his hand as it struck against the

 floor and elvin called for an assault directly
 on the massed enemy where the prisoners
 were still being held using his fists and
 his boots now as his only weapons elvin
 led that attack in and soon they were in the
 midst of the enemy ranks and forcing cap-
 tives free of them

   one after another the prisoners got free
and fought with the patrolmen but the
numbers of the enemy were too great and
they were being pushed back in retreat now
but with them were retreating all but very
few of the former captives and these swelled
the ranks of the settler force

   soon they were back where the fire-ball
guns could be brought into action and once
these began crashing among the enemy the
cunning leader shrieked his order and his
forces melted away into the side canals and
the settlers were left alone none spoke for
a time for the shock of the battle and the
horror of what they had seen was more
than they wanted to think about

  elvin had an arm around moreen sup-
porting her and he forced his mind to prac-
tical things by a sheer feat of will

   weve got to get out of here quickly
he snapped in a gasping fashion those
fiends will attack again theyre more cun-
ning than any fighters ive read of make
it quickly	

   	some ran some had to be carried as the
force retreated back through the sewers
to a point where they could begin a climb
up to the surface half way up the wall
began to crumble away from beneath them
and to fall down toward the massed settlers
below

theyre undermining our escape route

wo men from the wall were caught and
crashed down amid boulders to a death
by crushing in the canal below but the re-
mainder made their escape back to the
crouching group of settlers then they
listened attentively to elvins next plan and
those who could raced away as fast as
possible and those who remained moved
as quickly as possible

  so far they had not seen their enemy
again since the recovery of the prisoners
but they showed the evidence of their work
in the treachery of the crashing wall and
all knew that they must be working unseen
still the fastest of the escaping settlers
reached a point where there were two out-
lets to the surface above they commenced
to climb the first and then waited

  soon the remainder of the force were
gathered as if to ascend the steps but
almost immediately an ominous crumbling
was seen where a force was at work some-
where behind the wall

  now fast yelled dale shrilly its our
only chance

  his force needed no further urging and
they poured up the other escape with the
strongest of them helping the women and
children who were too terrified to make a
sound one after another they clambered
to the safety of the street and elvin was
among the last to reach the top his foot-
hold began to crumbled away and a hand
reached out and snatched him up from the
beginning of a fall and pulled him up to
the street the two light-carriers who fol-
lowed him were not so fortunate and
crashed to their death

  angrily patrolmen blasted fire-ball after
ball down into the darkness but only angry
shrieking came in reply

  gas dale said quickly weve got
to gas the sewers call a council meeting
weve got to get production going immedi-
ately theres no time to be lost

  but the cunning leader of the underground
enemy had seen enough of the settlers
means of fighting and he decided that they
soon would be coming back again with
this in mind he ordered most entrances
undermined and then he led his force in an
escape from the sewers that brought them
out in a field beyond the outskirts of the
city

page 

   from there he retreated still further till
his force was hidden among the forests
which had survived the years of deadly
radiation scouts were sent out and they
returned mid-way through the morning that
something was being filled into the sewers
and that this stuff lolled any who breathed
it

  then well get them into the sewers
again he shrieked

  so when elvin got a flash that the enemy
force was beyond the city attacking the
live-stock he rushed his men out in rocket-
cars and they zoomed down with fire-ball
guns blasting and immediately the stricken
hordes of the enemy retreated and fled into
open sewers

  theyll be killed there quickly enough
laughed elvin relieved

but from time to time they saw the
scouts of the enemy reappear and then
vanish again sensing that there was some-
thing more to this than he could see elvin
led a force from the rocket cars to the main
opening where the last enemy scouts had
been sighted and almost immediately he
knew what it was the wall of the sewer
had been collapsed in blocking off the city
from this channel and so that was safe for
the hiding enemy

  it means going down there again he
growled angrily

  no no moreen protested desperately 
you dont know how cunning they are
thats what they want you to do get more
gas please elvin

  his small eyes gleamed as he listened
and he saw the wisdom of the move there
wasnt any sense in taking risks not now
they had rescued all the prisoners they
could a few minutes was sufficient for
rocket cars to return with a load of gas
which was speedily pumped down into the
section of the sewer

  before long the men saw the earth heavy
with the hordes of enemy which were
escaping before the deadly gas could over-
come them these were without order now
and they split into small groups raced
away singly or stood their ground and died
above them a rocket car was busy with
two fire-ball guns blazing their charges
down at the fleeing masses
conquerors from below

  no man there was prepared to show
mercy to these merciless creatures who had
survived the wrath of the atomic wars to
mutate and flourish with a gifted intelli-
gence worthy of professor dale himself
but then with the death of the cunning old
leader the force was without control and
soon disintegrated entirely with every indi-
vidual fighting his own battle and struggling
for his own survival with that primitive
instinct that even their superior intelligence
had not made of no account

  in their scattering thousands they fled
from the fury of the attack which assailed
them from all sides every possible type
of weapon was being used by the settlers
and when fire-ball guns exhausted their
charges they were used as clubs on the
fleeing and routed armies from the city
children came and they joined in the battle
when all supplies of lethal might had been
exhausted and men were forced to fall
back on those primitive weapons used by
man in any emergency since the dawn of
time

  not a single specimen must be left
alive ordered elvin coldly not a trace
of this murderous species must be left to
blight the future of the new utopia plan-
ned by my father

but one man disobeyed this order his
scientific interest was aroused and he
could not resist trapping a pair male and
female and hiding them away among the
trees of the forest such specimens had
never before occurred in the whole long
record of recorded science and to these
two creatures he determined to devote his
life of study

  when that carnage was done the settlers
returned to the city to celebrate and long
through the night they drank and sang
there was nothing now to stop them from
the achievement of their aim out of the
carnage of the past they intended to build
a future without fear and a future without
death

  scientists had long known the essentials
of decay and these theories were now to 
be put into practice in the new society
until such time as all the lands of the earth
had been reclaimed for the use and benefit
of mankind	

  but one man was prepared to spend much
more time alone in the forest and since he
was one who had suffered captivity at the
hands of the dread enemy he was thought to
be somewhat mad and elvin dale dismissed
the reports that came to him concerning his
brother scientist

  weeks slipped by until that day when
the curious scientist failed to return from
the forest a party went to search for him

  that day he had come up to his cage
to study his captives again and in his hand

was the book wherein he recorded the
history of his strange captives but shocked
he saw the two bodies lying on the floor of
the rock cave as if dead anxiously he
prodded at them but they did not move
knowing the worst he had opened the door
and went inside and stooped over his
specimens

   in a fury of movement those two creatures
came to a sudden life and sharp teeth sank
deep into the scientists throat before he
could utter a sound and before that pair
vanished into the depths of the forest they
ate well in a savage and horrible ritual
feast

  the search party headed by elvin dale
himself found the spot and he picked up
the book and slowly read the inscription

  a study of two mutant rats

  rats rats he burst out angrily
from the dawn of time they have been
a plague upon man and now these super-
intelligent-horrors are loose to breed and
flourish in a year theyll be thousands

the stowaway

the huge spaceliner glided into port her
long bulk agleam with lights the
crowd of a thousand-odd tourists back from
their weeks tour of mars poured from the
spaceship on to the elevator towers de-
scended the two hundred feet on the elevatoi
platforms and were either flown awav in
their aircars or those whose homes were
close by in their terracars

   gradually the lights of the spacelinci
were extinguished until only the crew 
quarters in the bow of the machine were
showing against the black background the
fore airlock opened allowing a glare of ligh
out to dissipate the gloom the crew emerged
and the last to leave young spacecaptain
arthur downs extinguished the iast of the
lights and sealed the airlock behind him

   spacecaptain downs was the last human
being to leave but he was not the last travel-
ler to debark from the sl venturious

   stowaways on spaceliners were rare bin
rarer still were stowaways who concealed
themselves in the atomic fuel-converfer
chamber situated between the jet vents and
the inner hull and alive with atomic energy
and heat in that tiny chamber a human be-
ing would exist for perhaps a minute yei
it was in that inhospitable spot that the un-
authorised passenger had stowed itself

   as the gyro passed over the venturious
and flew on to the next platform a dark
figure emerged from one of lie jet vents
it moved slowly jerkily at first it stag-
gered for a fewsteps then straightened up
and stood still for a moment then in the
cylindrical head a pair of green eyes glowed
electronic eyes which took in the scene-
the rows of spaceliners the platforms the
enormous administration building still with
illuminated windows-took in the scene and
recorded every detail that the electronic
eyes could pick out and the resultant pic-
ture passed along the nerve wires and was
filed away in the robot consciousness for
further use and that was experience for
the robot but unlike human experience
it was not confused by war emotion

   deep in the mechanical consciousness
were rudimentary emotions by-products of

 the electrical nerve patterns but they were
 introverted emotions which could not reach
 out and find their counterparts in humanity
 the robot was a self-centred world within
 itself everything outside itself was alien
 nd hostile

   instinctively it knew that that low-flying
 gyro was its enemy the cold green eyes
 looked upwards followed the flight of the
 little machine waited until it had moved
 some distance and then the robot stepped
 from beneath the spaceliner and on to the
 elevator platform it found the controls
 knew at once the principle of the mechan-
 ism which was after all merely an elemen-
 tary principle while the robot was a vastly
 complicated and compounded system of
 hose principles

   reaching the ground the robot paused
nce more then keeping in the shadows of
the line of spaceliner hulls it moved towards
the distant administration building the
lights suggested humans and humans were
its enemy-humans who thought themselves
masters but the humans must not be aware
of its approach the robot must destroy
the humans quickly unexpectedly before
they could turn to technical devices which
they used as weapons

   in the gyro the patrolman blinked at the
visiscreen in the floor of his craft at first
it had looked like a man prowling around
the administration building but now the
liny figure was definitely revealed as
metallic

   a robot he gasped he pressed the
radio switch and spoke to the administra-
tion building ground patrol and
when ground patrol office answered indi-
cation of a robot south side of administra-
tion building and groundpatrol after a
preliminary gasp repeated the message

   a moment later the huge spaceport was
ablaze with light

men-or robots

spacecaptain downs first call after

o	leaving the administration building
was to one of the beautiful residences
clustered around the spaceterminal the of-
ficial residence of one of spacetours dire

tors one reason for he cail was to pick
up his aircar which he always garaged foi
the week while on a trip at the spacious
garage in the house grounds another
reason and more important one was ann
morrow

  the sliding door of the house was opened
by an elderly spaceport attendant a thin
faced severe eyed woman who lived in the
official residence and did intermittent duties
both there and in administration building
the severity of her face relaxed at the sighi
of the young spacecaptain

  shes waiting for you mr downs she
remarked

  thanks miss francis grinned arthur
and a moment later ann was in his arms
good to be back from the workshop
planet to old earth said the young man
i hope you wont be djsappointed in mars
when we go there on our honeymoon
darling

  disappointed on our honeymoon ann

smiled her deep blue eyes looking into his

 certainly hope not

  its just a big workshop you know all
the overflow of the masses of industrial
plants on earth still as youve never taken
i he trip before itll be an experience

  in the living room a tall tanned faced
grey-haired man rose as they entered one-
time spacecaptain morrow a pioneer space-
pilot anns father was now as a result of
his skill unremitting labour and driving
force a director of spacetours limited and
its several subsidiary companies it was a
position to which his future son-in-law
aspired but arthur downs knew that if he
did win to a directorship it would be by his
own efforts for inflexible conscientious old
dan morrow would not lift a finger to in
lluence the board in favour of relations or
friends he had given service himself and
iie expected it from others

and arthur every bit as independent
himself would not have had it otherwise

he waited until the thing was almost on lop of him before he
attempted to fire-and with the nun directed at one glowing eye
he pulled the trigger   

pag at
thrills incorporated

he was determined to achieve his ambition
without the aid of nepotism

  how are things this end sir arthur
shook hands youve been busy on the
board lately anything new

  there is dan morrows rather hard
grey eyes were tired the company is
reaching out arthur were planning a
new type of spaceliner a super-liner to
make possible regular trips to asteroidal
belt  as you know the present ships
for that trip are too small for economic
running but the problems associated with
building a super-liner are very formidable
indeed

  i know that sir agreed arthur 
suppose the company will transfer the main
workshop for the job to mars

  no dans tones were positive abso-
lutely out of the question it would take
more than a years preliminary and un-
necessary work we have most of the
equipment already installed in our earth
workshops certain industries lend them-
selves to the conditions on mars but space-
liner construction is not one of them he
paused then went on more slowly his eyes
on the younger man there is a way to
overcome the chief difficulty that of ob-
taining sufficient skilled labour

  i think i can guess it said arthur
shortly

  perhaps you can we havent reached
a decision yet but i hope things will be
finalised at the next meeting and the board
agree to approach the central government
council for permisison to use intelligent
robots

  arthurs jaw set and hostility peered
from his eyes hostility that was immediately
reciprocated by the older man the use
of robots was the one subject on which
the two men could never agree and more
than once it had threatened a serious rup-
ture between them it was a question on
which both felt too deeply to keep a dis-
cussion down to impersonal academic level

   quits agree with the principle of using
robots said arthur but they must be
the type we are using on earth now-fixed
single-purpose robots you know my views
on that sir

  only too well said dan morrow the
board discussed the matter for three ses-
sions and the few who dissented from my

suggestion had views similar to yours they
think the present set-up that of using fixed
non-intelligent robots doing one set opera-
tion on the mass-production line to be quite
satisfactory i spoke for hours trying to con-
vince them otherwise i pointed out that the
limited use of intelligent robots on mars
which was sanctioned by the central gov-
ernment council as an experiment has
proved successful so far and by the time
i had finished the opposition was weaken-
ing

   i hope they stick out said arthur
ann interrupted well dont argue
about it you two she said hastily  well
soon know what the board decides 

   its going to decide my way said her
father ill keep at the directors till they
do

  listen mr morrow said arthur
urgently i understand and appreciate your
ideas about efficiency service and all the
rest of it but you know as well as i do
that when we build walking robots who
can perform highly skilled tasks were virtu-
ally creating a new race were certainly
creating an intelligence

  nonsense snapped dan we can
limit their intelligence

  only up to a point said arthur if
youre going to build an electronic brain
capable of performing skilful tasks work
thatrequires thought and judgment at what
point are you going to limit that thought
capacity you cant build a robot mind
with a low ceiling of intelligence and expect
it to do high grade work

   no but the intelligence can be special-
ised

  arthur laughed i dont think you be-
lieve that yourself at the back of your mind
mr morrow the robot intelligence is
specialised at the time it is built but a robot
of that kind is capable of absorbing ex-
periences and learning and its learning
capacity will increase it can in theory and
 think in practice become greater in logi-
cal and coldly thoughtful processes than
jts creator

  old dans face twisted into a scornful
grin old-fashioned frankenstein mon-
ster stuff

   nothing of the kind said arthur hotly
its you who are old-fashioned if youd

page 
rogue robot

troubled to take a course in robotology as
i have-

  all right cut in dan harshly you
neednt ram your technological achieve-
ments down my throat

  dad ann moved over to him arthur
didnt mean to do anything like that youre
unreasonable

  thats enough young lady said her
father ive reached my present position
by work-practical application of what ive
learnt and all the technical knowledge in
the universe is worth nothing if it isnt
applied to some useful end

   but this is technology gone mad said
arthur savagely the sort of thing that
wiped out millions and came within a frac-
tion of destroying every vestige of civiliza-
tion three hundred years ago in those days
it was the hydrogen-helium bomb just
look back on history - first it was hand
weapons crude mechanical things then
small explosives which grew to larger ones
then the first crude atom bomb and finally
the hydrogen-helium bomb it was just a
matter of progressive inevitable steps weve
built up something since then but well
smash everything if we start unrestricted
creation of intelligent robots well end up
enslaved to mechanical monsters

   there is no other economical substitute
for a good intelligent robot persisted dan
a man can work only eight hours a week
under present high-pressure conditions a
robot works almost continuously theres
no argument against it why robots will
cut the time for the completion of our super
spacecraft to a fraction even you should
see that

   after all arthur said ann there will
be a limit to the number of intelligent
robots being built

   of course said her father he smiled
they dont breed you know

  therell be no limit said arthur
thats the whole trouble if the cgc
allow our company to build them and use
them on earth every other company will
make an application and it couldnt be re-
fused therell be thousands and thousands
of intelligent robots on the earth and they
will be learning - learning all about us
about our weaknesses and our shortcomings
and dont forget that after the first robots
bys been built the technicians will improve

on them i tell you theres no limit to the
capacity of a robot of that kind and they
will breed

  what old dan stared are you feel-
ing all right young man

  for practical purposes they will breed
persisted arthur what is to prevent
robots from building robots

a shock

dan morrow frowned for the first
time something akin to doubt appeared
in his expression only too well he knew
that some of his future son-in-laws argu-
ments were well founded for years the
central government council had refused
applications to build intelligent robots and
its refusal had been based on similar argu-
ments to those of arthurs immovable
robots on the mass-production line yes but
not the other kind and there was no
guarantee that the cgc would permit
them now but dan-who had already
sounded out several influential members of
the council had a pretty shrewd idea that
the application coming from the huge
spacetours company would be favourably
considered

  already the cgc had weakened to the
extent of allowing twenty intelligent robots
to be built and used on mars and their
reactions studied and noted

  arthur seeing the older mans slight in-
decision pressed his advantage

  mr morrow he said deliberately its
only a matter of another six months and
we shall have the report on the mars robots
dr cardew of the scientific council-
hes another alarmist snorted dan
bristling at the name hes always been
opposed to progress

  dr cardew persisted arthur patiently
insisted that those robots must not be
brought to earth on any condition until
the trials are completed and the report
studied why not compromise and wait on
the report

  weve already had a preliminary report
theres nothing to indicate that any of the
twenty robots are exhibiting other than the
reactions expected

  another six months wont make that
much difference urged the young mao
thrills incorporated

 not when you consider the issues at stake
 six months production loss is much dif-
 ference  said dan morrow doggedly and
 the mars robots are doing highly skilful
 work at amazing speed and improving every
 month

   improving-yes learning said arthur
just wait thats all i wont be surprised
to learn any time now that one of the things
has cut loose out there on mars  only
wish lie said passionately i were a direc-
tor id fight this thing to the finish

   old dan eyed him in silence his eyes
cold his shaggy brows contracted

   if youregoing to be ruled by imagina-
tive emotionalism and by old-fashioned
prejudice he said slowly youll never be
on the board at least not while i am in
a position to oppose your nomination
father ann flared at him her blue
eyes ablaze youve no right to oppose
arthurs nomination just because you dont
see things his way

   ive a right to oppose anyone with a
retrograde outlook the board has to be
progressive

   he was interrupted by the quick squirt of
sound from the visiphone he operated the
switch and the two-way screen glowed to
life it pictured the figure of an elderly grey-
uniformed official of spacetours limited
against the background of the chief patrol-
mans office in the administration building

  what is it pearson asked dan
morrow

   i have to report the presence of one of
the mars robots at the port sir all
directors are being advised

  what dans eyes bulged he half
turned towards the staring arthur then he
turned back to the screen yes go on
he snapped

   yes sir an intruder was located by
airpatrol and identified as a mars robot
ground patrol was advised lights were
ordered but a search failed to locate the in-
truder which was in the vicinity of admin-
istration building when first seen after the
search was completed patrolman jamieson
returning to his quarters near the adminis-
tration building found that the door had
been smashed open he entered armed with
his pocket raygun and found the robot in-
side jamieson used the gun burning a
small hole in the robots left arm but the

robot turned on him and smashed him
down jamieson is in hospital with a frac-
tured skull and severe lacerations to the
head he made a statement before he was
removed

  and the robot

   no trace mr morrow it escaped 
the chief patrolmans eyes dropped it-
it escaped mr morrow he went on slowly
with-with the raygun

  what a robot-with a raygun at
large

   yes sir

   i see thank you pearson    one
moment any indication as to how the
robot got here

   no sir it must have either stowed
away on one of the ships or else was con-
cealed on one deliberately the only ship
to come in to-day from mars was sl ven-
turious

   dan morrow pressed the switch and the
screen dulled again then he turned his
eyes icy	

   you heard that downs he said the
robot came on your ship to-night a sur-
prise - or is it

fugitive

tt was not immediately that the full impli-
l cation of dan morrows words struck
the young spacecaptain when it did his
tanned cheeks flushed angrily

   are you suggesting that i brought that
robot here he demanded

   dan jerked his thumb towards the visi-
phone screen you heard pearson your
ship brought the robot with or without
your knowledge

   great scot you cant seriously believe
that id smuggle a thing like that in to
earth it doesnt make sense you know
my ideas havent i been arguing against-
yes and this could be a way of empha-
sising your argument pointed out dan
you bring one of these robots in from
mars turn him loose and prove your point
the fact that the robot might kill a few
humans-theres jamieson in hospital with
a broken skull for a start-is neither here
nor there to you so long as you prove your
point

   and you think ive done that ann

arthur turned quickly to the girl you
dont believe this

  she made no answer but there was
troubled doubt in her eyes

  ann he gripped her arm fiercely

  it-it looks queer arthur she said in
a small voice

  it looks worse than that cut in her
father if you want my opinion id say
that not only did he bring the robot here
but he made sure the things actions
wouldnt be left to chance

  what do you mean mr morrow

   i mean that i still hold to the idea that
no robot built to do technical or mechan-
ical work would become a rogue of its own
accord but if its electronic brain were
tampered with by someone with a know-
ledge of robotology    he allowed the
sentence to trail away

  your father said arthur quietly is
accusing me of what is virtually murder
hes suggesting that i gave this robots
brain a twist a criminal twist and brought
it here and turned it loose do you believe
that

  again ann hesitated im trying hard
not to believe that arthur but-but it did
come over on your ship and well every-
thing points to what father suspects

  he eyed her steadily i know exactly
what it points to your father has made
an excellent case against me now im
telling you that i know nothing about it
that the first i knew of an escaped robot
was when i heard of it on that screen i
want a straight answer from you ann do
you believe me or not

  she returned his gaze with equal steadi-
ness then the troubled cloud cleared from
her eyes

  yes i do arthur

  you little fool exploded her father
why the whole thing is crystal clear well
see what the central justice council make
of it anyway see if he can fool them as
easily as hes fooled you he moved over
to the visiphone his hand outstretched to-
wards the code buttons

  what are you going to do asked ann
alarmed

  what else can i do but bring a charge
against him its my duty

  wait a moment said arthur pearson
will have already reported to the cjc

theres no need for you to do anything in
a hurry i might be able to assist in catch-
ing up with this robot-after all i have
a pretty sound knowledge of robotology
which should be useful but if you charge
me and im locked up-

  thats exactly what you deserve
growled dan

  he pressed the code buttons and the
screen glowed but arthur did not wait for
the picture of the local cjc chargeroom
to appear he drew ann to him kissed her
and ran from the room

  hey old dans voice followed him
youre only going to make things worse
for yourself by running away

  arthur ignored him he went straight
from the house raced down the wide path

to the garages and climbed into his aircar
no sense in staying to face a charge which
would be circumstantially against him

   he gritted his teeth as he operated the
controls and the aircar after its short run
lifted and shot up into the darkened sky
no better to be a fugitive and perhaps
try to hijnt down that robot if he caught
the tiling put it out of action at least he
would be preventing more violence and
even perhaps saving the lives of the mon-
sters potential victims and there still
remained a chance that a message may come
through from mars giving details of how
the missing robot escaped a slim chance
but the only hope the young spacecaptain
could cling to at the moment

   he pressed the control lever over to its
limit and the speedy little craft rocketed
through the night its beam light cutting an
amber tunnel of light through the black-
ness

   his destination was the home of his friend
and tutor dr cardew one of the greatest
living authorities on robotology as he
flew he pressed the official news button

page 
thrills incorporated

of the radio and immediately the level im-
personal voice of the official announcer
filled the little cabin repeating the same
warning over and over again

  aircar no xba to be apprehended
spacecaptain downs required for question-
ing all airpatrol cars attention aircar
no xba

  he switched off the announcer and at
the same time he saw the familiar dis-
tinguishing purple lights of a central jus-
tice council craft

pursuit

the official craft was lower down and
as yet some distance away but un-
fortunately it was directly in his path it
would be necessary now to make a wide
detour and that meant loss of time of
greater risk of discovery for the longer he
was in the air the more chance there was
of his craft with its conspicuous large
painted number being seen in the explor-
ing beams of the official craft

  as though to emphasise that risk a great
beam suddenly shot out from the official
craft and illuminated with blinding brilli-
ance another craft almost immediately
the beam faded but other beams were shoot-
ing out from official aircars further away
picking out every flying craft

  arthurs heart sank the hunt was de-
finitely on and he was being forced to swing
away east instead of going south where dr
cardews house wa located a huge fleet
of central justice aircars were scouring the
skies above the greater city area picking
up the wavebeats of every other craft and
briefly examining each one with the power-
ful beams looking for xba and it
would be only a matter of time perhaps
minutes before his craft would be picked
up

  and below official terracars would be
out their crews vigilant ready to move to
any point at which he might land directed
by the investigating aircars better to land
now rather than wait until he was forced
down and his whereabouts radioed to those
below

  he was still considering which would be
the better course when a purple-lighted air-
car moved across in front of him barely a

mile ahead the great glaring beam shot out
and picked up a craft on the left his
turn next setting his teeth arthur made
his decision he would try to make dr
cardews at least he would get as close
to die house as possible and trust to com-
pleting the journey on foot dodging the
terracars and the patrolling officers

  he pointed the nose of his little craft
downwards and skimmed low over the tall
buildings the aircar travelling at top speed
he was heading south-east but he could
make up the detour in a matter of a few
minutes once he got a clear run

   he looked in the direction of the official
craft its beam had faded again the in-
spection of that other craft having been
accomplished but the purple lights were
now swooping down on his trail the build-
ings below were long dark blurs as the
young spacecaptain using all his skill
piloted his tearing little craft over the flat
roofs banking and twisting unexpectedly

  he shot a quick glance behind through
the transparent rear port and was surprised
to see that the official aircar had turned
away and was no longer following him he
frowned strange there was no doubt
that his aircar had been observed and no
doubt that the super speed of the official
craft could more than match his own speed
he did not slacken speed however but
pressed the little craft on gradually veering
around towards the south    and then
suddenly he understood-understood what
he should have grasped immediately
ahead three purple-lighted cars were con-
verging coming from different directions
of course the official craft were assigned
different sections of the greater city area
and the one from which he had escaped
had simply called to the others in the area
to which he was heading and here they
were waiting to intercept him

  he gasped and automatically increased
speed the official craft which had ap-
peared with such startling suddenness from
the right easily kept pace with him the
beam revealing the telltale number on the
side of his craft then the beam faded and
small alternate blue and red flashes came
from the official craft the command to
ground his aircar and the other pursuing
craft had arrived circling him hemming in
the little aircar and all flashing out that

page 
rogue robot

imperative command to return to the
ground

  arthur obeyed the command-suddenly
he dived abruptly shot towards the ground
at terrific speed and gauging the angle with
a precision bom of his years of handling
spacecraft flattened out over the little park
and at the last second reversed the jet con-
trols the craft shuddered and creaked
alarmingly under the strain and as it
touched tiie ground arthur was flung for-
ward violently only the padded safety-
bar holding him to his seat prevented his
crashing through the nose of the machine
he recovered quickly and shut off the re-
verse controls just as the machine was be-
ginning to move backwards and stepped
from the aircar

  above the official craft were circling
lower preparatory to landing in the roadway
a matter of a hundred yards distant he
raced across the grass in the general direc-
tion of dr cardews house reaching the
edge of the little park as the first of the
official craft came to rest on the road

  the brightly-lit road in front of him
would have to be crossed which meant
emerging from the comparative gloom of
the park but as he hesitated the thin pene-
trating wail of a cjc terracar decided
him he raced across the road a clear-
cut figure under the light and a shout from
the grounded official craft indicated that he
had been observed and as he reached the
other side of the road the terracar its siren
screaming came into view

  he could hear the shouts of the officer
who had first seen him and an answering
cry from the terracar and then the pound-
ing of feet behind him he ran swiftly
turning down every side street in an effort
to confuse his pursuers but it seemed im-
possible to turn them from his trail and
to make matters worse he had succeeded
in confusing himself he knew he was
heading in the general direction of dr car-
dews home but was not now sure of the
exact location

  but when he turned another comer his
heart gave a great leap there not two
hundred yards away was the big house
he was about to make the last dash when
a chilling thought struck him it would be
impossible to reach the house situated as
it was on the other side of the brilliantly

lit road unobserved by his pursuers in-
stead of making the dash he shrank back
against the shadow of the walls and as the
pursuing footsteps came closer he darted
into the blackness of a doorway

  he saw the figure of the officer pass the
doorway waited then peered out only
one officer was chasing him now proving
that his twisting and turning tactics had
been partially successful in that they had
made the pursuers split up the officer
had now come to a halt and was standing
apparently nonplussed on the edge of the
roadway his green uniform and red-trimmed
cap conspicuous in the light then he
turned and retracted his steps and arthur
his heart thudding moved further into his
retreat as the officer began moving slowly
towards him flashing his torch into the
doorway of each building

  he could hear the footsteps coming closer
and closer as the man made his inspection
the officer was at the next building when
arthur feverishly debating within himself
as to the next move tensed his muscles and
waited every nerve in his body quivering
then footsteps again and a blinding light
full in his eyes

an ally

hphe young spacecaptain sprang almost
at the instant when the light appeared
he swung his clenched fist gauging the
distance as best he could by the shadowy
figure behind the powerful torch it was
a wild swing but a successful one before
the man was fully aware of the presence of
the young man he had dropped like a log
under the impact of knuckles on his jaw
the torch went out and dropped with a
clatter to the ground

  and his primary need now was to remain
free he could hear the wailing of the terra-
cars as they swept along the roadways in
the vicinity at present at least he had no
hope of escaping from this area his only
hope was to get to dr cardews-but he
dare not risk entering that pool of light
where his spacecaptains uniform  would
mark him out to any of the officers who
might at any moment arrive

  his uniform he gave a start and his
eyes gleamed why not he bent and

page 
thrills incorporated

  dragged the unconscious officer back into
  the darkness of the doorway 

	 

   so thats- the story eh dr cardew
  bald-headed thin wrinkled but suggesting
  wiry strength of body and possessing keen
  dark restless eyes that indicated undimin-
  ished menial activity had listened without
  comment while his nocturnal visitor related
  the events preceding his arrival and now
  you want me to hide you

only for a few days doc urged arthur

    yovi can stay a few years as far as
 im concerned replied the doctor indiffer-
 ently im not worried about that per-
 sonally i believe every word youve said
 and furthermore  consider myself partly
 responsible for your predicament for it was
  who taught you robotology and pointed
 out the dangers of the use of intelligent
 robots and another point  want to
 get on to the trail of this robot myself
 catch the thing undamaged and hear from
 its own speaking-box just what its reactions
 and ideas are now that we have found
 one which has turned on its makers it will
 be a more conclusive example of what could
 happen in the future than all the argu-
 ments i could offer the doctor eyed the
 young man for a few minutes you could
 certainly assist me downs and i don t see
 why you shouldnt

    if you could persuade the cjc
 began arthur

    im not going to try put in dr cardew
  my ideas are not popular among certain
  influential persons and there would be a
  howl if the cjc allowed you to remain
  at large after your little bit of handiwork
  to-night at my request no it shouldn t be
  in the least difficult to rig you out in some
  sort of disguise-different clothes perhaps
  a bit of padding here and there and a few
  wrinkles  not difficult at all how-
  ever well discuss that in the morning

unexpected visitor

  voull do dr cardew a gleam of
   amusement in his keen eyes looked
  at that young spacccaplain or rather at
  the changeling which had been spacecap-
  tain downs only the night before arthur

 was dressed in one of the suits of brown
 overalls and the brown skull cap of a jct-
 service station technician and he looked
 considerably older and plumper the former
 effect had been achieved by a skilful touch
 of grey on the hair showing beneath the
 skull cap and on the stubble which was the
 result of his not shaving the latter by care-
 fully arranged pads about his middle a
 close scrutiny would reveal the features of
 the young spacecaptain but a casual in-
 spection would not penetrate his disguise
 youll pass said the doctor although
 you do look rather like an older relation of
 yourself

   thanks for all your trouble doc said

arthur	

   ill go now downs to see what this sum-
 mons to the cjc means im pretty sure
 that theyve called me in order to have
 me assist in locating the robot in the
 meantime you remain here in the study
 ive told my assistant that youre working
 on some jet-control calculations under my
 direction so he wont disturb you fortun-
 ately i have quite a few jetservice tech-
 nicians popping in now and again for in-
 struction so the attendant wont be in the
 least suspicious

   for some moments after the doctor left
 arthur sat frowning thinking of the space-
 port and of the small cluster of houses of
 the spaceport officials ann all alone   
 he rose impatiently and took down one of
 the doctors books on robotology and
 gradually found his thoughts absorbed in the
 work but when he came to the chapter
 headed the instability of the electronic
 brain and read graphic descriptions of the
 horrible possibilities associated with unstable
 robots his fears returned try as he would
 he could not free himself from a growing
 foreboding until it filled his mind to the
 exclusion of everything else including the
 book he held before him

   he flung the volume on to the desk he
 couldnt stand this any longer he would
 have to get in touch with ann he didnt
 want to alarm her unnecessarily but a
 warning would certainly do no harm and
 he also wanted to reassure himself of her
 safctv there was a risk in using the visi-
 plione old dan might might possibly be
 in the house as lie often slipped over dur-
 ing the day and miss francis although

 page 
 unlikely to be there at that hour being more
 often in attendance in the evening may pos-
 sibly be at home still he was reasonably
 sure of miss francis she wouldnt srive
 him away

   he pressed the selection of buttons and
presently the screen glowed and he was
looking at the image of ann in the living
room of her home

   yes the girls voice and expression
were pleasant but impersonal if you want
to speak to my father you will find him in
the directors room at administration
building the code call is  

   ann there was relief in arthurs
voice at seeing her thus safe and un-
harmed after all those crowding black
thoughts of the past few hours

   the girl frowned i beg your pardon
im afraid -oh her eyes widened
arthur i ihought there was something
familiar about that face what on earth
have you done to yourself

   just a little disguise my dear smiled
the young man youre all right

   of course-but ive been terribly wor-
ried about you dont you think it would
be wiser to give yourself up im sure youd
be cleared sooner or later arthur

  no he shook his head things
looked bad against me at the start the
case your father made out against me seemed
fairly conclusive but now things look
worse ive bolted refused to obey the com-
mands of the cjc and assaulted one of
their officers ive got to stay free until
that robot is caught if its destroyed ill
have almost no chance of proving my inno-
cence the central justice council has
to get the truth out of the robot if im
to be cleared

   yes i suppose so said ann doubtfully
but i hate to think of you being chased and
hounded down arthur

   never mind about me he said quickly
think of yourself ann i believe that
that robot wont be far away from the
spaceport i want you to be particularly
careful of your movements and warn your
father too

   i dont think- she began

   i know he interrupted ive had a
feeling of impending trouble for hours prob-
ably only imagination of course but this
is not imagination just wait a moment

rogue robot

 ann    he picked up the book from
 the desk quickly flicked over the pages
 now just settle yourself comfortably for
 a few minutes and ill read some of this
 chapter on electronic brains i dont want
 to frighten you but dr cardew who wrote
 the book and who by the way is looking
 after me for the present is an expert on
 liis subject listen   he commenced
 to read slowly and carefully pausing every
 now and again to look up into the image
 of anns interested face

   and it was during one of these interludes
 after a rather long paragraph that he looked
 past ann and his shocked eves almost
 started from their sockets

   what-what is it arthur she cried

   he could not answer for a moment the
 words choked in his throat he pointed be-
 hind her at the figure standing in the door-
 way the dully shining metallic figure with
 the cylindrical head from which glowed a
 pair of green eyes

   theres no one- began the girl turn-
 ing her voice stopped abruptly she was
 silent for an instant then a frightened
 scream came across the viviscreen as the
 robot walked deliberately towards her

the robot strikes

 th horrified eyes the young space-
 captain stood staring at the drama
 which was being enacted before him on that
 glowing square screen of the visiphonc a
 drama that was stark reality

   the robot walked up to the girl who
 her back to the screen seemed petrified
 under the cold stare of those electronic
 green eyes	

   ann arthurs voice roused her run
 -run get out into the open for heavens
 sake

   she half turned to face the screen her

page 
thrills incorporated

 face deathly white then she made a quick
 movement to one side but the powerful
 metal arms shot out swiftly and a jointed
 metal hand closed over her upper arm in
 a cruel vice-like grip she screamed and
 struggled futilely and the robot s other arm
 moving with characteristic swiftness came
 up and the hand crushed over her mouth

   the two figures the monstrous robot
 and the slim young girl in its grip were
 completely filling the screen now ann s
 agonised eyes were turned imploringly to
 the screen little spots of blood had ap-
 peared on the metal fingers crushed over

her lips	  

   my god itll kill her robot
 arthurs voice was raised in a shout robot
 listen to me

   the robot paid no attention for a mo-
 ment it was looking down at the weakly
 struggling figure of the girl crushing her
 closer and closer until it seemed that her
 body would be broken against the hard cold
 metal of its own and then suddenly the
 girls struggles ended and she was a limp
 figure in the metal arms only then did
 the robot lift its face to the screen

   if youve killed her shouted arthur
 passionately i-ill- he broke off
 choking with the intensity of his emotion 
 she breathes according to her kind
 replied the robot but i shall kill her
 you can do nothing to me it allowed the
 girls body to fall to the floor the soft
 thud coming sickeningly to arthurs ears
 over the screen see the robot held up
 its left arm which was seared and had a
 hole in it just above the elbow your
 raygun could do only this to me i am more
 powerful than you humans who made me

    if you kill that girl you will be pursued
 and you will be blasted into slag you will
 not exist any more

   i am being pursued now replied the
 robot but i shall not be blasted i have
 a raygun the hand slid into one of the
 slots in the leg designed in the building of
 the robot as a receptacle for tools and
 emerged grasping a gun i think of all
 things i am intelligent the metallic voice
 had in it a faint quiver suggesting that it
 was under the influence of some rudimen-
 tary emotion possibly that of self-satisfac-
 tion i have an aircar outside went on

 the robot the human who owned it is
 crushed and lifeless i am powerful

   the robot bent below the screen and
 when it came into view again it held the
 limp body of the girl in its arms i shall
 crush this human

   dont arthurs agonised voice ran
 out as the robot raised the girl high that
 girl she is mine

   you are illogical said the robot i
 have her therefore she is mine she is only
 human so i shall destroy her

 	but i want her listen said the young
 man desperately that girl is important
 her father is a very great man and she
 is very valuable to him you must not
 kill her if you do kill her you will be
 destroyed yourself in the end no matter
 how many humans you kill understand

   he waited in an agony of doubt and
 apprehension as the message entered the
 brain of the robot and passed from cell
 to cell in that intricate maze behind the
 circular funnels of ears and the glowing
 green eyes at length the robot its mental
 functions having arrived at a logical con-
 clusion spoke

   whether i destroy her or not every
 human will try to destroy me but i am
 greater than all humans

   i tell you- began arthur but the
 robot spoke again

   but if she is valuable and i keep her
 i cannot be harmed for to harm me the
 humans would have to harm her again
 that peculiar quiver was in the level metallic
 voice i am powerful and i can use my
 power over humans but i am intelligent
 and i use my intellect to prevent humans

 from interfering

  the robots arms were lowered it
 tossed the girl over one arm and stretched
 out the other and the screen became blank
 and dead arthur his face white and
 strained stood staring at the dull screen
 his brain numbed by what he had seen and

heard	

   ann taken away by the monstrous thing
   tossed about in unfeeling metal arms which
   would carelessly and unemotionally break
   the bones in her arms and legs and body if
   she dared to struggle ann in the power
   of a horrible creation which could not under-
   stand the meaning of pain and would not
   be merciful even if it did and worst of

page 
rogue robot

all ann used as a shield as a protection
should the occasion arise which eventually
it must

   he shuddered and the sweat stood out
in great beads on his forehead as he thought
of the possible agony mental and physical
which the unfortunate helpless girl might
have to undergo before she was rescued if
she was ever rescued

   he straightened up his mouth set in a
thin grim line there was nothing for it
now but to contact the central justicc coun-
cil on the visiphone and risk identification
he must call the council report that the
robot now had an aircar and that it had
taken with it the daughter of dan morrow
as he made this decision the door opened
and dr cardew entered the study he
looked in surprise at the young mans
strained ghastly face

   ive heard the news said the doctor
quietly i see you have too but although
its a shocking business-a man battered
beyond recognition of anything human and
the robot in possession of an aircar you
mustnt allow yourself to be-

  you havent heard everything cut
in arthur in a choking voice the robot
has ann-ann morrow

   what dr cardew stared unbelievingly

   arthur as rapidly as he could force out
the words told of what he had seen and
heard and at the end of his story he said
and now oot the cjc as quick as you
can and tell them-tell them you saw and
heard what ive just told you theyll put
every available officer on to the job the
result of an all-out chase might mean anns
death but theres nothing else to be done
the robot will have to be captured or des-
troyed and then call dan morrow at
administration building and tell him you
-youd better not mention me the young
mans face twisted into a bitter smile its
ironical he said the very man who was
championing the use of intelligent robots
has been struck at by one-struck through
the person who means everything to him
his only daughter

the wrecked aircar

dr cardews aircar stood outside the
huge administration building at the
spaceport arthur in his role of a jetservice

technician remained in the car and kept
his face concealed by bending over one of
the motors a spanner in his hand the
doctor had decided to inspect the vicinity
in which the robot had murdered the owner
of the aircar which it now possessed and
arthur rather than remain cooped up in
the doctors study had accompanied him
and he was now waiting anxiously for the
famous robotologist waiting in the hope
that the latters inspection and subsequent
deductions made from his profound know-
ledge of robot psychology would suggest
the future moves of the robot

  the doctor emerged from the wide col-
lonaded entrance and walked quickly to the
aircar his quick step indicating some sup-
pressed excitement

    well young man he said entering the
aircar and seating himself at the controls
our robot is following the behaviour pat-
tern i expected so far it did not stray far
from the spaceport-it was actually hiding
in the administration building

  the robot was made of ray-proof
material because it was designed to work
where humans could not work in atomic
furnace rooms and the like and it knows
that humans cannot go into such places
that by the way was why the raygun had
so little effect upon it actually the only
effect was from the heat of the ray which
burnt only a small hole in the arm the only
really vulnerable spots are the eyes which
are the foci of its locomotive nerves-it
sees through the eyes and its footsteps and
hand movements are guided by what it
sees one eye destroyed would destroy
the movements of one arm and one leg to
a great extent both would have to be sbpt
out with a raygun to kill movement its
difficult even after we track it down

  and that seems hopeless now groaned
arthur theres been no report of the
stolen aircar

   yes it was seen heading north

  to northfield said arthur itmight
make for the spaceport there doc

  it would not know of the existence of
northfield pointed out the doctor if
it happened to stumble on the city and find
its spaceport then it would keep in the
vicinity of the spaceport but i do not think
it will go far from here as he spoke the
doctor swung away from the city and

page 
thrills incorporated

 headed north keeping over the wide road-
 way which was divided by a ihin black line
 into two sections one for terracars and the
 other for landing aircars ive an idea he
 cnplained as he brought the aircar very close
 to the ground that the stolen aircar is
 not very far away knowing the direction
 it took was of vital importance for the
 robot mind would automatically follow a
 landmark such as the road below at least
 while it was guiding an aircar that rocky
 country to the left and right is altogether
 strange and foreign and until its brain has
 become accustomed to such a landscape
 the robot will avoid it and of course it
 knows that it must have a smooth strip of
 road on which to bring down the aircar
 thev had reached a point where the land
 dropped away sharply on each side of the
 road and the doctor circled slowly ins
 keen eves peering through the floor window
 he shook his head at last and the craft
 spiralled up and went further north and
 at every likely spot where the formation
 suggested caves he repeated his circling in-
 spection

    perhaps the cjc officers are correct
 after all he said at length disappointment
 in his voice they seem to think that it
 will keep going north and eventually reacn
 northfield weve already covered more
 than a hundred miles might as well get
  back there may be fresh developments
 which might give us a lead later on

    you dont think it might have turned
 off the main roadway to one of the smaller

    it would have been observed everyone
 has been warned and- the craft gave a
 slight lurch as the doctor broke off and gave
 a little involuntary tug at the steering control

    what is it asked arthur quickly

    it might be it dr cardews eves
  were gleaming as he swung the craft around
  arid commenced to circle lower look
  see-under those branches no no   
  not there ill point the nose directly at

itthere	

    yes yes i see it metal silver
  arthur craned forward as they approached
  the spot in a steep dive saw the glittering
  metal clearly in the rays of the afternoon
  sunshine and as he looked an icy dread

filled him	

    the stolen aircar had a silvershecn

   page 

 finish said the doctor my calculations
 that it wouldnt be taken far-

 but its crashed said arthur dully its
 smashed up amongst the rocks and trees
 and ann  

the attack

 rrtj-ie two men stepped from the aircar
  which the doctor grounded on the
 roadwav and the latter laid a restraining
 hand on arthurs shoulder as the young
 man began hastily scrambling down the
 rocky bank from the road

   not so fast cautioned dr cardew
 whatever may have happened to the girl
 the robot could still be in action our
 proper coursc would be to radio back to
 the cjc and have men out

    not yet said the young man grimly ii
 ann is-if anything has happened to her
 yes but if she is still alive and a horde of
 officers come here the robot will become
 desperate and kill her either deliberately or
 in using her to protect itself as it threatened
 to do well look around first doc

    the spot where the silver aircar was seen
 was no more than five hundred yards from
 the roadway but so dense was the green
 growth of trees and bushes that the men
 had to orient themselves by looking back
 at the place where their own aircar was
 resting and take a line from that as they
 drew nearer the doctor suddenly uttered
 an exclamation he pointed to a clump

 blsh-	 	t j

   see that young man its been pushed

aside and broken and certainly not by a

 crashing aircar

   you mean the robot it came back

 this way

   i mean something very different said
 the doctor follow me and by very care-
 ful the robot came this way dragging the
 aircar

    dragging it

   exactly dont overlook the enormous
 strength in those robots downs it s
 srounded the aircar safely on the roadway
 and brought it down here and concealed it
 under trees and bushes well see in a
 moment but go warily it may be tn
 the aircar still although i rather think it
 has sought somewhere to hide a cave from
 which it can emerge from time to time to
rogue robot

make attacks on humans that would be
its plan

  they followed the broken track through
the bushes until they came upon a dense
mass of small trees and bushes heaped high
and completely covering the stolen aircar
only a faint silver gleam revealed its
presence

  the strength of the thing muttered
arthur looking at the splintered trunks of
the small trees where the robot had torn
them down he moved closer to the
doctor let me go first he said and
give me the raygun

  well go together young man dr
cardew withdrew his pocket raygun im
quite capable of using this

  slowly they drew up to the little aircar
but no sound or sign came from within
carefully the doctor parted the branches
and peered through arthur craning after
him they looked into the interior of the
aircar which was empty arthur drew a
quick breath as his eyes looking through
the transparent window fell on a dark
sinister looking stain on the floor of the
craft

  it-its blood

  im afraid so the doctor nodded
slowly he patted the young mans shoulder
but keep a hold on yourself he led him
from the window around to the other
side weve got to have all our wits about
us if we are to catch up with-

  the rest of the doctors sentence was a
gasp as a brilliant blue-white streak cut
across the air followed immediately by a
sharp crack as a tree trunk not ten yards
away split down the middle and burst into
flames

  a raygun shouted the doctor
quick-behind those rocks he flung
himself forward as he spoke and lay flat
on the ground behind an outcrop of rock
as arthur joined him another lightning-
like streak appeared this time only a matter
of inches above their shelter struck and
split a rock just behind them and sent a
column of smoke and flame into the
bushes which flared and cracklcd fiercely
another and another shot from the raygun
followed each discharge sending out flame
which hungrily attacked the trees and
undergrowth the two men unable to
expose themselves to the murderous ray-

gun crouched behind their rock almost
stifled by the smoke and scorched by the
approaching flames

   well be cooked alive if we dont move
shouted arthur

   well be blasted if we do panted dr
cardew your handkerchief-tie it
around your mouth

  put your head down and follow me
then said the young man through
there    see he pointed as the smoke
eddied away for a few seconds revealing
a blackened strip fringed by glowing red
saplings what lay ahead was a matter
only for conjecture but there was no time
to think of anything but the immediate
emergency of the torturing scorching heat
of the leaping flickering flames even a

blast from a raygun would be a merciful
end compared with death in this inferno

  arthur led the way keeping his arms
up to shield to some extent his face he
stumbled over the hot blackened ground his
feet stirring up fresh spurts of flame in the
smouldering grass he swerved and
ducked as ruddy glowing pillars loomed
up through the smoke the slim trunks of
trees from which the branches had been
burned he could hear his companions
thudding footsteps close behind him and
from time to time he looked back to see
the dark figure of the doctor through -the
shifting haze of smoke and drifting glowing
embers but at length the sound of his
friends footsteps no longer reached-him
he stopped ahead the air was clear
the fire was in this direction at least
almost spent a fact due to the sudden
dropping away of the ground but the
thought of making that last dash to safety
without his companion did not occur to
the young man

  he turned and stumbled back whence

page 
thrills incorporated

he had come shouting wildly an answer-
ing chocking shout responded and presently
he saw the lurching figure of the doctor
and then a dense wave of smoke blotted
it out again he plunged forward grasped
the doctors arm and tugged madly

  only-a-few-yards he panted

  cant make it and as that last des-
pairing gasp was forced from his lips dr
cardews knees sagged and he would have
fallen into the hot blackened ashes under-
foot but for arthurs support as it was
the young man bent and caught the sagging
man on his shoulder straightened up and
staggered heavily forward his breath
coming in great heaving gulps his sight
almost gone in that mass of smoke his
body a great living focus of agony as he
urged his flagging limbs to obey his will

   on one of the brief shifting gaps in the
smoke he saw the clear sky ahead and
the sight acted as a spur he floundered
forward even achieving an awkward run
and the effort was the last required of him
he broke out into the cool air stood for a
moment on the crest of the rise then
dropped slowly to the ground the burden
of the doctors body rolling from him

a temporary advantage

a sudden startling thought caused
arthur to sit upright and turn to the
doctor still lying on the ground his chest
 heaving but showing signs of returning
consciousness he shook him violently
and as the other opened his streaming eyes
arthur shouted at him the raygun-
where is it

  dr cardew stared uncomprehending
then he raised himself on his elbow the
-the raygun he repeated the-oh

	he looked back into the smoking bushes
its there back at that rock when the
tree branch fell on me i let it fall he
attempted to rise but arthur pulled him
back

  -dont get up yet the robot isnt far
away it might be watching us its
probably on the other side of this valley
ia a cave were helpless without that
raygun arthur rose to his- knees and
peered cautiously across the little valley to
the rising ground on the other side

  the rise was rocky and sparsely dotted

with stunted trees it was probably honey-
combed with caves and hollows any of
which would afford a place of concealment
but lie shook his head no the robot
must be closer than that to have been in
a position to watch their movements and
get a line on them before using the raygun
he turned to the right and saw a similar
formation rising rocky ground more
promising for anyone in one of those caves
would look down on the spot where they
had been attacked he was about to
mention his suspicions of the robots
whereabouts to the doctor when the latter
silenced him with a gesture

   back he whispered urgently crouch
down-quick

  arthur obeyed and as he did so he
heard a steady succession of thudding
sounds intermingled with a grating as of
metal striking rock he lay flat in the
grass his heart thumping against the
ground as the sounds steady deliberate
came closer he lifted his head a little
looked in the direction of the approaching
sound and clenched his hands tightly
there coming through the thick bushes
was the robot bearing in its arms the
passive figure of ann morrow the girls
clothes were torn and ragged her hair wild
and one sleeve of her ripped dress stained
with blood

   the sight caused a quiver of mad rage
to surge through the young man he half
rose as though to fling himself at that soul-
less metal monster but the doctors res-
training hand was a silent reminder of the
futility of such an action instead he lay
still while the monster strode past skirting
the smouldering trees and eventually
coming to a halt on the edge of the sloping
ground to the valley

  the aircar whispered the doctor
its remembered that fire will damage the
machine my god he exclaimed its
going to walk straight through that
smouldering bush with the girl    no-
dont he gripped arthurs leg as the
young man rose wait it might not-

   anns voice raised in a scream reached
them dont take me in there ill bum
-dont you understand-ill burn

   i cant stand this any longer arthur
was on his feet shaking off the doctors
grasp

page
rogue robot

  wait a moment its hesitating

  the robot had stopped its great
cylindrical head bent down its glowing
eyes looking into the girls face

  yes came the metallic voice you
will burn you are only human  shall
not burn i am greater than fire it can-
not harm me i am a robot greater than
humans

  therell be no holding that confounded
monster now muttered dr cardew
every triumph it has over human weak-
ness aggravates its abnormal superiority

  the robot instead of walking into the
smouldering heat turned sharply arthur
with a gasp found himself looking into
those green glowing eyes at the same
instant ann saw him she uttered a cry
and struggled madly but the robots arm
held her tightly

  arthur-arthur that agonised cry
coupled with her pigmy struggles in the
cruel metal arms was too much for the
young man ignoring the doctors warn-
ing shout he rushed towards the robot

  the robot stopped dead its brain res-
ponding slowly to this amazing develop-
ment-a weak helpless human rushing
fearlessly to attack it not only did the
robot halt but it moved back several steps
as it adjusted its brain to the phenomenon
for a moment arthur thought that it would
drop the girl in order to use the raygun
which was clenched in its right hand but
the thing made no attempt to do this on
the contrary it held her tighter indicating
only too clearly that its mind was impressed
with the thought-pattern that the girl was
its protection and it proved too to the
anxiously watching dr cardew that some
element of doubt as to its invulnerability
still lingered in the recesses of the electronic
brain

  and then with amazing swiftness the
robot tossed the girl over its shoulder
gripping her with its left hand while its
right hand holding the raygun was raised
arthur had a glimpse of the deadly muzzle
as he dropped to the ground but it was not
this manoeuvre that saved his life it was
ann her body writhing her legs kicking
that did that her foot struck the metal
hand holding the gun deflecting it only
slightly but sufficient to cause the stabbing
blue-white ray to shoot past the young man

and to blast instead of a human target an
outcrop of rock

  arthur lay on the ground helpless ex-
pecting at any second the searing blast
which would end his life as swiftly and
disastrously as a flash of lightning bui
the blast did not come instead he heard
the sound of stone crashing against metal
and he looked up to see the robot its arms
outstretched staggering back under the im-
pact of a small rock which hurled with
desperate strength by the doctor had
struck the monster full in the face

  the impact caused absolutely no damage
to the robot the deep-set glowing eyes
being impervious to ordinary mechanical
damage while its toughened metal skin was
similarly immune but the fiercely hurled
rock threw the thing off its balance causing
it to stagger and as it moved back its foot
came to rest on one of the many loose rocks
which shifted under the weight the robot
swayed its huge body trying automatically
to regain its balance but failing the arms
stretched outwards allowing the struggling
ann to fall to the ground the metal hands
spread open and the raygun dropped and
then the robot itself with a heavy clanking
sound toppled over and lay sprawled on
the ground

crippled

  with a shout arthur sprang to his feet
and raced over towards the sprawling
robot his objective was the raygun a
few feet from the robots outstretched arm
but the robot although lacking the supple
agility of a human was possessed of extra-
ordinarily efficient jointing and the upper
half of its body swung up at its jointed
middle before arthur had taken more than
a few steps either divining the young
mans purpose or automatically seeking the
weapon which had proved so spectacularly
efficient the robots arm swept out in an
effort to grasp the gun but failed to reach
far enough arthur pounced on the gun
jumped back quickly as the monster rose
to its full height and made a swift move-
ment towards the young man deliberately
arthur levelled the weapon at one of the
glowing green eyes as the robot came to-
wards him

  a thrill shot through the young man as

page 
thrills incorporated

with a low hiss the gun belched forth its
blue-white streak the charge struck the
robots head sending out a spurting mass
of brilliant sparks and causing the thing to
stop in mid-stride there was a deep scar
in the side of its head and a little rivulet of
molten metal ran down its cheek and con-
gealed-but the eyes were untouched

  you cannot harm we with a raygun
came the cold metallic voice a raygun
kills men nothing can kill a robot it
moved forward again and arthur turned
and ran from it but stopped and wheeled
around suddenly he realised that the
robot convinced that it was immune from
anything but superficial damage by the
raygun would move straight towards him
and he wanted time to steady himself and
take careful aim he waited until the
thing was almost on top of him before he
attempted to fire and with the gun directed
at one glowing eye he pulled the trigger

  the flash from the raygun and the shout
of triumph from the young man were
almost simultaneous the robot stopped
swung around on one leg and staggered
drunkenly and a throbbing sound suggest-
ing an emotional current issued from its
fixed slit of a mouth and when again
it faced him arthur saw that one eye alone
glowed in the cylindrical head and where
previously the other had been was now a
blank black socket below this dark hollow
were little bubbles of congealing metal from
the effect of the superheated blast bubbles
which grotesquely suggested tears

  again arthur skipped back and levelled
the raygun at the remaining eye if he
could destroy that eye the robots nerve
centres would be destroyed-it would have
no power to move but it would still have
the power to accept messages through its
ears translate them into meaning in the
aural centres of its artificial brain and res-
pond and that meant that the thing could
be carried back and questioned as to the
manner of its escape from the neighbouring
planet could answer and in so doing re-
move the suspicion now hanging over the
young man

  carefully arthur took aim at the glowing
target but before he could press the trigger
the robot swung away and with one arm
hanging uselessly and one leg dragging it
moved across to where dr cardew sup-
porting the wild-eyed ann was anxiously

watching the duel between the man and the
monstrous machinc

  run shouted arthur get back to
the roadway-to the aircar leave the
robot to me doc get ann away

  the raygun has destroyed one arm and
one leg came the robots voice accom-
panied by a throbbing hum which made
the words difficult to understand but it
will not damage me further i have learnt
now  will destroy you and i will again
have the girl to hold before my eye

  as it spoke the robot lurched over the
ground at amazing speed considering its
crippled state one arm moving like a piston
while the other hung limp one leg shooting
outwards and jerking the body forward
the other alternately propping up the
swaying body and dragging heavily behind
grooving the ground in its progress

  dr cardew alive to the new menace
swung the girl from the path of the
approaching monster and the two ran to-
wards the still smouldering bushes stopped
and commenced to make a detour around
the blackened area arthur ran forward
his gun ready to spurt destruction to the
robots remaining eye at the same time
shouting to the others

  back to the roadway doc-to the air-
car radio the officers to come out here
ill keep the robot busy li cant get
away

  for a moment arthur considered his
chances of following the robot through the
smouldering vegetation and diverting its
attention or slowing it up by attacking it
with the raygun from the rear but after he
had taken several steps into the burnt and
still burning area he retreated quickly no
human being could get right across that
patch of heat alive

  but he might stili be able to divert the
robot by using the raygun the weapon of
which the thing was now afraid he levelled
it pulled the trigger-and nothing hap-
pened the weapon thanks to the robots
earlier prodigal use of its charges was now
empty

  fight for the aircar

ith a muttered exclamation arthur
flung the useless weapon aside and
raced in the direction taken by dr cardew

page 
rogue robot

and ann he came in sight of the roadway
as the robot reached the bank well ahead
of the other two and commenced climbing
doggedly up towards the grounded aircar
dr cardew leaving ann ran to the bank
reaching it by the lime the robot about
twenty yards to the right of him had
climbed half way

   arthur caught up with ann slipped his
arm around her waist and helped her across
the uneven ground

   lt looks hopeless he panted if only
 had a live raygun

   oh ann clutched his arm fiercely
look its fallen

   the robot hampered by its almost use-
less leg had toppled backwards the
clanking thud as it struck the ground and
rolled back heavily for a few yards was
music to their ears the doctor mean-
while spurred on afresh by this setback to
the robot was clawing his way upwards

   but the robot was again upright in a
moment and steadily and this time cau-
tiously pausing to ensure its balance
climbed to the roadway

 ann	  

   the girl intent on her efforts raised her
 head and a scream of fear issued from her
 lips as the robot taking a few stumbling
 steps down the bank grasped her arm with
 its good hand and hauled her up and
 dragged her across to the aircar

   both arthur and dr cardew stood petri-
fied with horror at this sudden unexpected
-but from the robots viewpoint-logical
move the robot wanted an aircar but it
also wanted the protection which the girl s
presence would offer and now it seemed
like achieving both those aims

   with a hoarse cry arthur ran forward
in that awful moment in which ann was
bein draeged across the roadway in the
steely grip of the mechanical monster he
did not hesitate to sum up his chances
against the giant strength of the robot
he flung himself against the metal arm and
tuoged madlv but he may as well have
attempted to wrench a steel girder from its
foundation for all the impression he made

   an aircar the doctors voice raised
in a hopeful shout reached him as he
clutched at the arm someone comma
keep at it im coming

   arthur could hear the others running

footsteps as the powerful arm swept him
up from ihe ground as if he were a baby
he felt the metal fingers gripping his
shoulder in a crushing grasp and dimly
he realised that at least the monster must
have dropped ann since only one ol its
hands was effective

   the hand released him suddenly and he
staggered back he had a fleeting glimpse
of that single glaring green eye then he saw
the metal arm its hand clenched into a fist
upraised he flung itself to one side
as tha terrible fist descends felt the im-
pact of a blow on the side of his head and
was whirled into the blackness of uncor
sciousness

the robot will come

 a nnv that was the first word that
rose to arthurs lips after he had
struggled back to painful consciousness

   shes all right it was dr cardews
voice that answered him

  arthur closed his eyes for a few
moments a blessed wave of relief and
thankfulness passed over his clouded mind
it was good to lie there-to relax and
know that ann was safe    languidly
he opened his eyes again and saw that he
was in the bedroom he had occupied the
night before in dr cardews house the
doctor was standing beside the bed a
different person from the wild-eyed
tousled man with the soot-blackened face
whom arthur last remembered as running
towards him just before the robot struck
except for a few strips of flesh-covered
dressing on his face and a singeing of his
hair the doctor seemed little worse for
the experience

arthur raised his hand to his aching

jjage 
thrills incorporated

head touched a patch of dressing and
winced

  youre lucky commented dr car-
dew if that blow had landed direct it
would have cracked your skull like an
eggshell young man but nothing that a few
days rest wont fix for the rest-a few
bums and scratches

  arthur struggled up to a sitting posture
the robot where is it

  thats what the cjc officers have
been trying to find out since yesterday
afternoon replied the doctor it got
away took off just as that private aircar
-which brought us back by the way-
landed it headed back this way but we
lost sight of it behind the clouds it must
have taken that aircar to the maximum
altitude

  and theres been no sign of it since
none whatever but said dr car-
dew positively i am quite sure that it
isnt very far away and  am equally
sure that it will again attempt to reach
ann sooner or later its mind is definitely
impressed with the thought-pattern that
that girl is essential to its protection and
yesterdays experience has made the im-
pression very deep  should say that
despite-or because of-its crippled con-
dition it is more deadly than ever ive
contacted dan morrow on the visiphonc
and warned him never to leave ann in the
house alone until that robot is caught or
destroyed

  how is she her arm was injured and
shes had a shocking experience is she-
dont worry about her she had a
nasty gash on the arm from the robots
fingers and as you say a rather severe
shock but from what i heard from her
father she is almost her own self again
you were by far the most severe casual ity
and a day or two should fix you up
and what about mr morrow asked
arthur is he still of the opinion that
im behind that robots presence here
dr cardew shrugged hes a stubborn
man dan morrow im not sure what he
thinks about that but we should know very
shortly i had a rather sharp talk with
him over the visiphone and as a result hes

coming over to see me he should be
here any minute now

  he knows im here

  of course and the fact that he hasnt
reported your whereabouts to the cjc
already is evidence that he is beginning to
doubt your guilt

  arthur sank back on to his pillow re-
lieved at the doctors words more than
anything just then he longed to hear from
old dans own lips that old dan was mis-
taken and unjust for in spite of the old
mans rather unyielding nature and at times
narrow outlook the two had got on reason-
ably well together and it would be good
to get back on to the old footing it would
certainly make things more comfortable
for ann

  he lay waiting impatiently for the ex-
pected visitor and when at length dr
cardew returned and announced his arrival
arthur sat up and greeted dan morrow
with eager friendliness a friendliness that
was not reciprocated

  ive come around to thank you sid
old dan gruffly ann has told me what
happened yesterday and what nearly hap-
pened dr cardew here had quite a lot
to say about it over the visiphone too you
risked your own life and probably saved
anns and im naturally grateful if it
wasnt for that i should have handed you
over to the central justice council as it
is i merely suggest that you obey the law
and give yourself up for questioning

  i see said arthur dully so you still
believe that im responsible for the robots
being here

  old dan did not reply at once his
cold eyes rested on the young man in the
bed his shaggy brows contracted in a frown
for a moment and arthur knew in that
moment that he was still under a definite
suspicion and knowing dan morrow he
should have known how difficult it was to
get an idea out of that stubborn mind

  we wont discuss that said dan
shortly youve had a bad time as i
said before im grateful for what you did
for ann but if anything had happened to
her    he broke off and his veined
hands knotted into hard fists and his eyes
blazed briefly he recovered quickly im

page 
rogue robot

not saying anything more just now ive
an open mind on the subject

  youve a closed mind-on most subjects
dan put in dr cardew you get an
idea into that skull of yours and it stays
locked in

  dan whirled on him savagely i know
my own mind cardew if thats what you
mean as for your ideas said dan a
sneer in his voice wed never have any
progress if we all carried on like fearful
old women as soon as anything new was
mentioned

  so in spite of whats happened you still
think that those electronic monsrous imita-
tions of man should be created in numbers
simply in order that spacetours limited
can reap greater profits and build super-
spaceliners quickly and cheaply

  you cant stop science snapped dan
that said the doctor is the whole
trouble you cant once you give
science a free hand without any regard
to the consequences on humanity it will
gallop on to destruction dragging mankind
with it science almost succeeded in des-
troying everything on this planet in the
atomic war he paused and added
that robot can profit from experience 

  i know all about your theories cardew
said dan youve been howling calamity
at the central scientific council for years
and this sort of thing must be very satis-
factory from your point of view well
it will take more than one robot-and one
thats probably had its brain tampered with
-to convince me my friend

  dr cardew sighed youll learn in
time dan i only hope youll still be alive
to profit from your experience

  what do you mean growled dan
you trying to scare me cardew

  im trying to warn you said the doctor
quietly whether you will concede that
 know anything of robotology or not-
you should admitted dan youve
been thinking and talking of nothing else
ever since ive known you

  very well i suggest then that you get
out of that house move away perhaps to
northfield until that robot is caught
dan stared are you mad

  you will be if you dont take my advice

the robot is going to pay you a visit dan
somehow it will try to get at ann shes
a fixation in its brain it will be coming
to your house dan

  the intensity of the doctors tone caused
dan morrow to stare then he laughed
but it was a feeble attempt at scornful
merriment and im to bolt like a fright-
ened kid eh run away from a machine
ive warned you dan thats all i can
do but ive never been more deadly
serious in my life

  you cant allow ann to run a risk like
that mr morrow said arthur passion-
ately

  what risk demanded dan a risk
that your friend here has thought up he
frowned i think its a lot of exaggerated
nonsense he said at length but for my
daughters sake-and for her sake only
mind-ill arrange for a guard around the
house ill feel a nervous old fool for doing
it but ill tell the cjc that its your idea
cardew

  by all means assented dr cardew
i shouldnt like the members of the cjc
to think you a nervous old fool when
actually youre just a foolhardy old idiot
good day old dan directing a
venemous look at that bland faced doctor
strode from the room

a warning to ann

jt was perhaps an hour after dan morrow
had left when arthur was roused from
an uneasy doze by dr cardew re-entering
the bedroom he sat up quickly for the
doctors expression was one of repressed
excitement

  ann said arthur quickly has any-
thing happened

  shes all right said the doctor at
least ive heard nothing about her but ive
just heard something about the robot it
came over the news a moment ago   
my stolen aircar was found right outside
the spaceport in the airpark

  great scot gasped arthur

  it was the logical place to park the
aircar pointed out dr cardew there
are hundreds of aircars there and theyre
coming and going all day no doubt the

page 
thrills incorporated

robot flew into the airpark and simply
concealed itself inside the aircar by lying
on the floor perfectly satisfied that the
craft would not be picked out amongst all
the others which in fact was correct
the aircar was there all night but of
course there were the usual odd aircars
which off and on keep the number up to
twenty or thirty all through the night

  and the robot itself said arthur
anxiously

  still missing replied the doctor but
its suspected now that it went into the
adjoining terracar park and got away in a
terracar anyway it abandoned the air-
car and a terracar has been stolen a
description of the vehicle has been broad-
cast and cjc officers are on the lookout
both the ground patrol and the gyro air-
patrol it cant get far but added dr
cardew i doubt if the robot will try to
get far it is probably obsessed with the
need to conceal itself until it can get pro-
tection

 you mean-ann

  the doctor nodded arthur flung back
the bedclothes and stepped shakily to the
floor dr cardew gently restrained him
but arthur shook the others restraining
hand from his shoulder im not going
out doc he said irritably im going
into the study to contact ann or her
attendant on the visiphone and im going
to keep in touch with her frequently during
the day i couldnt lie here in bed while
that confounded monster is at large and
its whereabouts unknown

  a good idea young man agreed the
doctor but for goodness sake relax
between calls

  somewhat to arthurs surprise it was
ann herself who answered the visiphone
she was in pyjamas and dressing gown
and the only visible effect of her terrible
encounter was a small strip of plaster on
her upper lip where the robots silencing
hand had cut her mouth but there was a
pallor on her cheeks which suggested that
the strain of the ordeal had taxed her inner
reserves

  arthur the smile that sprang to her
face at the sight of him in the screen
banished the drawn expression for a
moment her eyes became animated i
was just about to call dr cardew to learn

how you were she eyed him critically
you should be back in bed you know
you look washed out

  same to you said arthur with a faint
grin then he added on a sober note
youve heard the news about the robot
-about the aircar found not half a mile
from where you are now and when she
nodded he said dr cardew had a talk
with your father ann he suggested a
guard around the house

  i know dad came back and told me
hes going to arrange with the cjc to
place the guard here from tonight
tonight he ought to do it right away
ann theres no telling when that thing
will try to get at you

  ann smiled deprecatingly it certainly
wont come here in broad daylight arthur
if it was mad enough to try it would be
seen by someone

  im not so sure demurred the young
man the thing does the most diabolic-
ally shrewd things and yet after its done
them we realise that theyre logical whod
have thought it would have calmly driven
its aircar into the airpark and be confident
that the craft would be virtually lost
amongst all the others in any case i
want you to promise to keep the doors
and windows locked at least you will get
warning if it has to smash its way into the
house i and keep your attendant near
you

  youre giving me the creeps com
plained ann but i promised miss
francis is out just now-thats why i was
able to get out of bed and come downstairs
-but shell be back any minute    ann
stopped suddenly and half turned there
she is now by the- sound of it arthur ill
have to rush back up to bed you can
call again during the afternoon if you like
but i shant be worried until its dark and
by then well have guards with rayguns
patrolling around the house so dont
you worry theres a dear

  hastily ann switched off the visiphone
and moved quietly from the room to the
circular staircase outside the door on
the third step she paused and listened for
the sound of miss francis movements at
the rear of the house but heard nothing

  she returned to her room after all
it was bright enough in there with the huge

page 
rogue robot

sheet of one-way glass in one wall faintly
ribbed by the thin-edged louvres which
at the press of a switch would turn blot
out the window and make the room rest-
fully dark but just now she did not feel
like lying in darkness she went over to
her bed removed her dressing gown and
sat down on the edge of the bed and for
the first time she faced the way she had
entered

   and then her widely staring eyes beheld
standing against the wall beside the door
the huge figure of the robot

another visit

the single glowing green eye was fixed
on ann the robot took limping
steps forward and the silence of those steps
on the soft floor covering enhanced the
suffocating sense of horror for the unfor-
tunate girl she stared dumbly unable to
utter the scream that rose to her constricted
throat

  the robot stopped and its monstrous
cylindrical head bent down towards her
then it spoke

  i shall now take you with me in the
terracar said the robot then i shall
get another aircar and i shall conceal my-
self and i shall emerge and destroy
humans for i am stronger and more intelli-
gent than humans you shall be with me
for then none shall try to destroy me

  the monster turned and at the same
instant an earpiercing shriek filled the room
and standing in the doorway ann saw her
attendant miss francis her long thin face
white as chalk her eyes almost bubbling
from their sockets

  go cried ann desperately get
help call arthur call- a metal
hand clamped fiercely over her mouth
blocking her cries and she felt herself
being jolted violently as the robot made a
crooked leap towards the attendant

   but miss francis after that first shock
of surprise acted with amazing speed a
speed attainable only under the compulsion
of desperation with one horrified stare
she turned and sped down the stairs her
thin piercing screams testifying to the
direction she had taken her repeated
cries of help oh help were suddenly
faint as she closed a door behind her

  the robot clutching ann descended the
stairs slowly and carefully one leg stiff and
rigid as it found each lower step the
door through which miss francis had
rushed led into the living room and it was
now locked but from inside came faintly the
babble of her voice the robot stopped
doubtfully then suddenly it dropped ann
raised its fist and crashed it through the
tough plastic of the door

	 

  back at dr cardews house arthur had
remained in the study endeavouring with-
out success to smother his nagging worry-

ing thoughts beneath the printed pages of
the doctors books

  as a result of these conflicting argu-
ments which he turned over and over in
his mind arthurs nerves were in a state
of tension bordering on breaking point
and when the visiphone suddenly emitted
its buzzing spurts of sound he almost leapt
at the instrument pressed the switch and
brought into the study the image of miss
francis and brought too the piercing
chattcring cries  as the horrified woman
babbled out her story

  its here-here she screamed its
got ann its coming to get-

  a rending crash from the door behind
her caused her to turn to face the threat
of the mad monster but arthur after
catching a glimpse of a gleaming metal
fist in the shattered door waited no longer
he raced from the room to the laboratory
and burst in

   its at anns he cried ill get the
aircar out you tell her father meet me
outside

  dr cardew without a word nodded and
ran to the study spoke over the visiphone

to administration building of spacetours
and emerged hatless and still wearing his
white plastic laboratory overall and leapt
into the aircar which arthur had brought
from the garage and with a prolonged
hiss the aircar with the grim-faced young
space captain at the controls sped in the
direction of the spaceport

oneman job

 a s the aircar swooped down on the run-
way outside the house arthur set the
siren screaming a warning at the crowd
which had gathered and was spilling over
the white strip there was a scattering
and he piloted the craft skilfully over the
heads of the onlookers and almost burnt
out the jets with the suddennes of the
reverse action as he brought it to a stop
almost as it touched the ground he flung
open the door and raced towards the house
followed by the white-overalled doctor

  he saw ahead of him a thick cluster of
people apparently gathered around some-
thing or someone and with a stab of fear
n ms heart he flung himself at the group
and elbowed his way to the centre

  ann his voice choked as he looked
down at the still form clad in thin torn
pyjamas a uniformed emergency medical
officer was bending over her and as arthur
uttered her name the long eyelashes
moved and she looked up recognition
driving fear from her eyes ann he
was down beside her are you hurt
she shook her head fainted said the
medical officer rather severe shock
but shell be all right

  arthur anns eyes widened and she
struggled to sit up ignoring the restrain-
ing hand of the medical officer miss
francis she-shes in there-with that
monster

  you mean-you think  

i-i dont know whats been going on
there since  dont want to think-
d

  dan morrow pushed his way towards his
daughter his drawn face relaxed when
he saw her standing beside the young man
he grasped both her wrists and held them
tightly without uttering a word but the
unutterable relief in his eyes was eloquent
of the strain he had undergone

  i didnt get dr cardews message
immediately he said i left the adminis-
tration building to walk home slowly and
i was half-way here when the message
came the operator called my office first
and gave the message to my secretary and
then it was sent out through the address
system i came on by foot he looked
towards the house is it in there

  yes snapped dr cardew and so
is miss francis

  he clutched the others arm and pointed
the robot had appeared at the back door-
way and was limping out on to the porch
in its arm it held miss francis apparently
as yet unharmed her face a ghastly mask
of fear and in its hand the robot held
a raygun

  it has found it said arthur through
his teeth

  arthur ann was at his side theres
a terracar down in the bushes the robot
is going to make for that

  several cjc officers armed with ray- 
guns were spread out across the grounds
the robot after taking a few tentative
dragging steps stopped and a hush cam
over the crowd as the thing spoke

  i shall destroy this human if anyone
tries to destroy me it said i shall des-
troy any human who stands in my path

i found the gun i sought

  and no sooner had the words left its
slotted mouth than the raygun was lifted
a blue-white streak shot from its muzzle
and the uniformed cjc officer directly
ahead of the robot was disintegrated into
a burst of white-hot flame

  a gasp went up from the crowd and
the other officers moved back as the robot
limped forward

  theyll have to bomb the thing said
dan theres no other way

  and blow that woman to dust said
arthur no there is another way
he turned swiftly ran to the nearest officer
and before the bewildered man who was
anxiously watching the robot could com-
prehend what had happened snatched the
raygun from his hand and raced along the
grass in the direction of the clump of ttees

  what- began dan morrow hes
going to where the terracar is hidden im
going too he made a move after the
young man but dr cardew stopped hko
rogue robot

  no you dont he said shortly if
it was merely ja matter of trying to prevent
the robot from getting to the terracar the
officers could do that but fortunately
theyre not trying anything so foolhardy
they cant stop the thing-theyd be
blasted if they did and that woman is in
the line of fire young downs has some-
thing else in his mind hes probably going
to try to get a shot at it from ambush and
thats a job for one man you stay here
and leave it to him dan

final encounter

tjehind the clump of bushes towards
- which the robot was advancing
arthur found the terracar as dr cardew
had suggested he was going to try to get a
shot at the robot from ambush and he
intended using the car itself as his place
of concealment he flung open the door
and stepped into the long tube-like body
of the vehicle and through the window and
slightly moving foliage he had intermittent
glimpses of the limping robot it stopped
every now and again the raygun threatening
the officers while across its powerful arm
its human burden lay not daring to move

  arthur waited every nerve tense but
the hand that held the raygun was steady
only too well he knew that the would have
one chance-one shot only and with that
shot he must strike the glowing eye even
then there would be a terrible risk for the
robots prisoner a slight movement on
the part of the robot and the blast would
strike the metal of its body and the while
hot blast would spread over the tough
surface and miss francis would be seared
to death while a slight error on his own
part would have the same tragic effect

  but as the robot reached the shield of
low trees and bushes around the terracar
the unexpected  happened one of the
officers seeing the imminence of the
robots escape took a desperate chance and
fired the blast streaked across the inter-
vening space missed the robots head by
inches and struck the patch of trees a
white streak of flame shot upwards and
the next instant the trees and busfics were
a mass of flame and smoke

  arthur saw the robots head turn to-
wards the fire behind which rested the

terracar and then the monster raised the
raygun and bolt after bolt of blue-white
streaks were released from the gun as the
robot backed towards the terracar it
plungedstraight into the burning bushes
and the frantic woman utering a scream
of agony squirmed and struggled on its
arm and the robot preoccupied with the
operation of its raygun allowed her to fall
to the ground the woman had risen to
her feet and was running madly before the
robot gave chase it limped after its
quarry in giant strides eating up the short
distance the officers were shooting wildly
at the robot but although one of the ray
bolts struck it on the side of the body
sending out a brilliant burst of sparks it
failed to check the monsters lurching rush

  the screaming woman was running
towards the house as offering her a refuge
and then a gasp went up from the crowd
as in a whirl of flying burning branches
the terracar shot from the fire and streaked
like a rockct towards the robot

  it was over in a matter of seconds
arthur at the controls with the terracar
jets flat out directed what was virtually a
projectile at the robot he had a glimpse
of the gleaming figure of the robot as the
terracar ate up the short distance and
then a crash as the monster was tossed into
the air and he felt himself being jolted
forward against the front screen and an
excruciating pain in his right shoulder
which took the brunt of the impact

   as the terracar rolled over on its side
he shut off the controls clawed at the
uppermost door and scrambled out but
already the robot had risen to its feet and
had turned vengefully towards the cause
of its disaster arthur crouched behind
the vehicle saw the green eye glaring the
temptation to fire the raygun was almost
irresistible but he waited there could be
no mistake this time the robot came
closer and in the hush the robots voice
harsh and throbbing spoke clearly carry-
ing to the eagsr ears of all that expectant
crowd

   it is you again said the metallic voice
ever since  escaped trom vnc semination
of humans on mars you have been trying to
destroy me you have maimed me now

i	shall destroy-

page 
thrills incorporated

  the burst from arthurs raygun cut the
sentence short from past experience with
the robot he knew that a threat was no
sooner uttered than with lightning like
speed it was carried out and this time he
did not wait even as his own raygun spat
flame the robots arm had been raised but
it never completed its movement the blast
struck the green eye squarely there was a
burst of flame the blue-white tinged with
a green glow and the robot still standing
was sightless two blackened sockets were
now in the big cylindrical head there was
something almost pathetic in the way the
thing turned its head slowly from side to
side the sightless sockets seeming to be
searching for light it attempted to move
lurched and collapsed flat on to the ground

conclusion

the central justice council officer
kneeling beside the prostrate robot
rapidly wrote in his tablet as the helpless
monster spoke in the little cleared circle
of the vast crowd which was being kept
back by a ring of officers were arthur and
dan morrow and ann who was support-
ing the shocked miss francis and kneeling
alongside the cjc officer was dr car-
dew who was addressing the questions to
the robot

  well said dr cardew at length
having completed his questioning i think
that is quite conclusive the robot says
it escaped from the mars factory hid itself
in the atomic fuel-converter chamber of
the s l venturious because it knew that
no human could follow it there the whole
idea behind the escape project was simply
to get away from human domination it is
no  of the intelligent robots and there-
fore the most experienced and that was
why it was the first to attempt escape and
to resent domination

  others will escape came the robots
voice throbbingly robots are greater
than humans therefore they will destroy
humans robots will come here and they
will restore my eyes for they are skilful
and i shall walk again

  ill have the central scicntific council
send a man out to remove the head and
destroy the electronic nerves completely-
said dr cardew shortly to the officer

   on the porch dan turned to the young
man i owe you an apology he said
simply  owe you more than that in
fact more than  can ever repay you you
not only saved ann and  think miss
francis but you and you alone destroyed
she threat of that monster

  no mr morrow dr cardew-

   he did a great deal put in dan mor-
row but your efforts made all the differ-
ence arthur and i realise now that you
have been right all along the line and i
-i have been utterly wrong i have been
quick to condemn you but ill be quick to
make amends old dan paused he looked
a very old man after the stress through
which he had passed then he went on
very deliberately- when you take my
place in the near future as director-
what the exclamation came simul-
taneously from arthur and the girl

   im getting on said old dan with a
tired smile and im getting out while
theres time for me to enjoy a rest you
will be my nominee arthur

   i-i dont know what to say mr mor-
row said the young man

   you owe me nothing i owe you a lot
dan looked at his daughter then he held
out his hand and the two men exchanged
a firm grip

   dan morrow stepped from the porch out
into the open im going to see the last
of the robot he said you two wont
want to see any more of it no doubt
youve something more interesting to dis-
cuss

   we have grinned arthur
