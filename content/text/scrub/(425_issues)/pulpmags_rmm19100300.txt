watch for willets

the traveling correspondent of the railroad mans mag-
    azine once more takes the long trail prospecting for stories
    on main line and branch line north east south and west
    when you see him rolling along the rails in your direction
    put the arm against him and start in stovepiping if you can
    extend a helping hand mr willets will appreciate it the editor
    of this magazine will appreciate it and we will all be happier

-atch for willets  these three words have come to be per-
haps the most important in the railroad mans magazine

       watch for willets  has been the slogan by which the name
of this magazine has been carried from coast to coast and from
the lakes to the gulf

      willets is off again he is going to make a bigger circuit than ever and he is
going to do it just as well as ever thisjs his fourth annual tour for the railroad
mans magazine

      the stories that he has unearthed in his previous tours have carried our readers
on the tide of enthusiasm theres a reason every story has registered some throb
in the life and growth and history of some section of the country

he has grasped the railroad spirit

      it is amid surroundings such as these stories have depicted and by such inci-
dents as have been related in them that step by step the country has been built up
it is these incidents that have transformed barren deserts or luxuriant wilds into
prosperous home country where virile men and gentle women have lived and fought
and made laws for themselves

       it is these things which form the real history of our country and it is these things
that willets has repeatedly gone to find out and has related with all the vividness of
an enthusiast that is the secret he is an enthusiast

gilson willets

who is making his fourth annual visit among the railroad men
of the united states for the railroad mans magazine

when collis p huntington and his associates rushed east to meet him with the cen-
tral pacific to the time when as if by a miracle the chicago milwaukee and st
paul threw a perfect road across the continent in a two-years flash

    mr willets has a knack of interpreting all of these phases of railway history
and he has it because lie believes in the railroads and in railroad men-because he
likes them and they like him that is why he was restless to be off among them again

   that is why the railroad maxs magazine has sent him

    by the time this article gets into print willets will again be hobnobbing with
railroad men the longest and in some ways the most important stretch that he will
watch for willets



 strike over which he has not been before is the new extension of the chicago mil-
 waukee and st paul to the pacific coast called the chicago milwaukee and puget
 sound

      we expect this to be one of the most productive stretches of any of mr willetss
 trips	i	

     very few people realize the importance of this new line the country that it
 opens up is an empire compared with which many of the kingdoms of europe are
 bankrupt and barren and yet in spite of the speed with which this wonderful road
 has been constructed-and in spite of its perfection of road-bed and the ease of its
 grades-there have been difficulties to encounter

these threads of steel make history

      the stories of these difficulties are as full of thrills and have demanded as much
 courage and vigor as have many of the spectacular feats of war which go down to
 posterity as history	

     when you read these stories you will realize that the real history-makers of a
 great country with its vast untapped wealth are the slender threads of steel whose
 course is conceived in the godlike imagination of men who are too large for war
 history-makers whose track is laid by the wonderful skill and brilliant daring of men
 to whom mountains are incentives and not oppositions who throw their spidery steel
 bridges across impotent chasms and roaring rivers

     these are the men who are making history who are writing modern epics-
epics essentially american essentially progressive-and infinitely more vaulting in
the daring and ambition of the subject than the childish sword-thrustsof all other
epics it is the desire to grasp this spirit and to catch here and there a stanza from
this wonderful epic that calls mr willets from his home and people to be a part of
this railroad life 	- -

     but not only do we deal with these giants of the railway world-these creators
 and conquerors of vast territories-the switchman the brakeman the section-man
 the gang foreman the operator the engineer the mail clerk the shop worker and
 the office man-all these come into the net of our story-hungry correspondent with
 all these men he has the same bond of sympathy the same loyalty to the railroad the
 same love of railroading and his admiration for them is as keen as is his admiration
 for the more brilliant but not more useful makers of ways

his journey will take him over the new roads

      so in this new country on the new road by which he is going to travel these are
 the men that he is looking for not for the sake of how many words of space he can
 -get out of them but because he has been among them before and he is their friend
 and they are his friends

     the puget sound railroad is not the only new road over which mr willets will
 go on his story-hunting career but more of this later we will now tell you as
 nearly as we can the exact course he will pursue on leaving new york

     his first dash will be to baltimore and washington from there he will break
 away to new orleans on the queen and crescent route but it will be by no means
 a direct road

     he will zigzag among old historical roads of the south where during the tragic


the railroad mans magazine

days of the civil war railroad men carried arms in the cab and were almost as
important members of the army as were the soldiers themselves it is a fact that in
many instances in those old days a civil engineer-usually a railroad man-was of
more importance at the moment than the greatest general

    the south teems with these yarns you will probably know some of them
watch for willets

    from new orleans mr willets will work toward memphis over the yazoo and
mississippi valley and from there he will take the missouri pacific to st louis
leaving st louis he will run over the chicago and alton to kansas city a section
chock-full of railroad yarns practically untouched

     from kansas city the rock island will take him to el paso and this stretch
with the additional one from el paso to denver over the santa fe provides a field
even more unlimited than the st louis-kansas city leg

     from denver he will push over the denver and rio grande to salt lake city
making many stops on the way at salt lake he will strike the first stretch of en-
tirely new railroad the recently opened western pacific through which he will com-
plete the western loop to san francisco

     leaving san francisco he will reach out to seattle over the northern pacific
and the southern pacific  and from there to chicago he will come homeward over
the new st paul extension

 over ten thousand miles of track

     the home trip from chicago to new york will be made over the erie railroad
a road which perhaps more than any other in the country abounds in tales of old-
timers and in historical interest

     if you take a map and measure up roughly this swing around the union as we
have outlined it making calculations and allowances for sweeps in and out the circle
you will find that mr willets when he gets back to new york will have covered
over ten thousand miles of main line if he is coming your way you will want to
see him more than that he will want to see you

     thats a combination that is hard to beat

     you will hear of his approach down the line because he is welcomed everywhere
and by everybody from section-man to general manager it is hard to miss him
but at the same time

   watch for willets

by horace herr

this month we introduce a new character in a new series by horace herr
author of  being a boomer brakeman which was published in our
fall and winter numbers

      in nearly every little railroad town there is just such a character as
almost he mingles in everything-no matter what it is he is as ready
to fight as he is to laugh he knows every one and is a sort of town joke
town guide and town fool combined but generally he has the right stuff
in him anyhow heres to  almost

-the general foreman hires a clerk

there is a sudden addition to the population of hulbrook which
almost and maggie mahorney the postmistress

try to remove

hen i dropped off the
  varnished cars at hul-
  brook that morning i
  didnt know that it
  was there in fact f
  wasnt sure that any-
  thing was there except the box-car station
  for the town was so small you needed



an electric headlight and a magnifying
glass to locate it

  i believe according to the last census
there were fourteen people in hulbrook
but red hot frost told me confidentially
that the census man counted two hoboes
who had temporary quarters at the water
tank and that the mexican who took


the railroad mans magazine

care of the switch lights was counted
twice once at the east switch and once
at the west

  but i got it straight from maggie
mahorney who dished out the mail twice
a day when there was any that  onct 
there was as many as four families in
hulbrook counting jed latroupe who
had a wooden leg and a livery stable

and there was it

  i guess maggie had the real  order
on the town history all right because
she had a pleasant little way of reading
the mornings mail before she delivered
it in the afternoon and every one looked
on her as something just as good as an
evening newspaper

  but then maggie wasnt responsible for
it when i dropped off no  that-
morning i had the old mans signature
on a piece of railroad stationery which
advised the general public and other
officials of the road that  effective this
date william willard thomas is made
general foreman at hulbrook arizona
vice timothy omoran resigned

  of course having the paper didnt
do much good if there was no one around
to read it and as soon as i found my-
self before the box-car station i looked
about to find some one who would be
interested in this bit of documentary
evidence

  the station-agent read it and made a
noise like a leaky flue i felt like calk-
ing him right there but i happened to
look up and saw it holding up the left
hand corner of the station

  whats that i asked

  whats what came back from the
agent as he looked in the direction i
was pointing

almost any old thing

   that decoration at the corner of the
box car and then a smile almost the
only smile i ever caught lingering about
in the vicinity crept over the agents
face as if it had a slow order

   oh thats almost

  almost what

   almost any old thing jist almost
he replied and flagged down the smile

i looked at it it really was almost

anything it was almost the missing
link almost human almost nothing

  it must have been born in kansas dur-
ing a grasshopper year or a season of
mighty drought it was undersized to
begin with sort of a human narrow-gage
with a face like a rust-colored apple
with the rust put on in spots

  its freckles were almost as conspicu-
ous as its grin which stuck out on its
facial premises like a track at a blind
siding

  the mouth to begin with was cut on
the bias and the chin ran off toward
joness there was a lot of slack in the
joints just as if the arms and legs were
coupled on with links and pins and a
fellow kept expecting it to break in two
every time it got into motion

all right when in motion

  and that motion it was on one side
with a flat wheel when almost first
started out you would have passed him
up as a -to-l shot against a field of
snails blit when he once had the steam
working he was as easy to stop as thirty
cars of coal on a forty per cent grade
with wet rails

  but it was interesting just the same
the longer you looked at it the better
it got it was so homely it was good-
looking and then that smile well in
hulbrook arizona in that day and age
any old kind of a smile looked like ready
money

  if i had known what hulbrook was i
should not have disturbed its sand-colored
quietude but it was down on the time-
card in the same size type as the other
towns and most any place with the price
of a weeks lodging and three squares a
day looked good to me then

  about six months before i was keeping
company with a goat down in the u p
bull-ring in kansas city and being ab-
sent-minded by nature i started the goat
out at a nice easy pace with three peddlers
hooked on behind and forgot to shut off
until i had hit a visiting officials brass-
railed dog-house so hard that the burr-
head didnt stop to open the door but
came through the window bringing a
bowl of soup and a string of cuss words
along with him

i understand too that the stenograph-
the evolution of almost



er who happened to be the husband of
the officials wifes sisters second maid or
some other close kin was so flustrated
that he put in a full stop instead of a
comma and of course had to write the
letter over again as soon as he got the
omelet out of his hair

for the great wide west

  of course i got mine and never hav-
ing been outside the city limits any dis-
tance to speak of i decided to drag it
for the great wide west where dollars
grew on trees and promotion came every
other day whether you wanted it or not

  well when i folded up my service
letter and an extra suit of denim pajamas
and climbed aboard the rapid wagons i
had never met almost nor heard of hul-
brook when i reached albuquerque i
made a little personal call on the mas-
ter mechanic impressed him with the
eighteen-carat quality of my ability as an
all-around man and inside an hour had
exchanged my line of talk for the paper
which made me  general foreman at
hulbrook

where hulbrook is

  of course the next thing was to find
hulbrook if it had not been that the rail-

road led one to the town no one would
have ever been able to find the place the
second time and no one would-- have
wanted to

  its about half-way between some place
and some place else and if it ever sprink-
led three drops of rain there every man
in the town would start to build an ark
and if every real man in the town had
been building an ark the day i arrived
there would have been as many as one
ark in the course of construction

  excepting myself there was the sta-
tion - agent and excepting the station-
agent there was me and not counting us
both there was a mexican section hand

exciting as a funeral

  being a general foreman at hulbrook
was almost as exciting as being a pall-
bearer there was a rusty old  y 
traced there a pit for cleaning ash-pans
a water-tank and a spur track for coal
and water cars

  going west out of hulbrook almost
every freight had to have a helper so
a great deal of the time there was a pusher
engine which needed attention and the

the railroad mans magazine

lars of any mans money to live in the
place for a month believing that i was
earning my money by just hanging around
the place about the second week i de-
cided to hire a chief clerk

  being chief clerk to the general fore-
man at hulbrook demanded a young fel-
low with a strong back and few brains
and i had about decided that such a youth
could not be found in the town when
our little village was rudely broken in
upon by a large recl-faced gentleman of
uncertain occupation who came off the
blind just a few inches ahead of a flag-
mans number tens

the new population

  as our new population weighed all of
 pounds it made quite a commotion in
the community when it alighted the
first shoek came about  oclock in the
morning the second shock came twelve
hour- later and it almost precipitated

pit track and i walked down to look
her over and show the crew that the
general foreman was always on the job

into the trouble

  both the eagle-eye and fire-boy were go-
ing over to jed la troupes livery stable to
spend the night and i was strolling up
the plaza de sandorino toward the box-
car station where i had taken temporary
lodging when i heard a scream which
sounded like it came from the post-office
about fifty yards away

  i speeded up a little pulled alongside
then decided that the occasion demanded
that i go inside as the door was locked
i had to be a bit rude but when it flew
open with a crash the light from my lan-
tern was most-welcome to both myself
and the rest of them c they were as
badly mixed up as two baldwins after a
head-on collision

over in a far corner near the door

chief clerk at forty-five -

general foreman was supposed to keep
a weather eye on the whole works

the work wasnt considered in the pay-
check for it was worth one hundred dol-

maggie mahorney into a siege of nerv-
ous prostrations

about  that night a pusher en-
gine came in to spend the night on the

i told almost we had decided that-
the evolution of almost



which led from the post-office to the dobe
room where maggie mahorney lived was
maggie herself in one hand she held a
lamp which had been blown out and in

men came to their feet and for a mo-
ment i thought i would have to take a
hand in an ungentlemanly affair

   i never did think a great deal of fight-
ing i always had a funny way
of getting my face into the oth-
er fellows fist so that win or
lose  generally came out look-
ing like a human porous plas-
ter and just so long as both
men were on their feet i did not
care to interfere

  besides it was worth the
price of admission of course
it looked like a goat fighting a
tandem compound but at that
the goat had a way of butting
in and getting away again that
made him an even-money bet
and a couple of times i couldnt
help but give him a glad hand
when he struck a coupler into
the big fellows lights

  but the kid was giving away
a lot of weight and i felt sure
the time was approaching when
i would have to get into the
melee-and i wasnt a bit anx-
ious

  maggie however was getting
excited and she kept twisting
that cannon around in a way
that made a fellow nervous

  well the big show had been going on
for about five minutes when the new in-
habitant set out- a load of coal on the
boys eyebrows and he went to the floor
and i was just stepping in to leave the
impression of my lantern over the bullys
brain-house when almost came up from
the mat bringing the poker along and
gently tapped his nibs over the cupola

  he telescoped went down in a heap
and the boy started to put the kickers
to him when  interfered-and came near
getting thrashed

    theres no need killing him i yelled
at the boy who excepting the bloody
spots on his face was as white as a sheet

  he almost robbed the post-office
panted the belligerent in justification

maggie tells the story

  but he let up and we proceeded to
tie the fellow hand and foot and i went
over to the station told the big news of

the other she held a cannon which would
have blown the entire town of hulbrook
off the desert if it had ever decided to
explode

  in the middle of the room near the
stove which was used about twice a year
but left standing all the time almost
and our new population were so fixed up
you couldnt tell which was which

maggie holds the gun

  just as i came through the door mag-
gie turned that gun in my direction and
it looked as big as the supai tunnel then
she seemed to realize that i was one of
the regular animals and lowered the gun
 stepped farther into the room throwing
the light onto the bunch of hostility on
the floor

  hes robbin the post-office screamed
maggie

   i cant see where hes having much
luck i answered and just then the two

the railroad mans magazine

the day and sent a message down to the
next town for the united states marshal-

  when i went back to the post-office to
see that everything was all right maggie
mahorney and almost were having a
little chat i heard the boy saying 

    i reckin it wasnt just right ter drop
that poker on him that-away-but  al-
most had ter do it

   goodness but youre a brave man i
heard the woman say and then in char-
acteristic humility the war-scarred hero
piped

   brave nawthin didnt he break inter
your post-office i almost had to whip
him cause after we come in ter see what
the racket were you was startin in th
door so i couldnt git out and there i
was an there he was and some one had
ter get licked and it was almost me

honoring the hero

  the next day we had to invent some
way of doing honor to the hero we
couldnt have a parade that day for one
of those arizona sand-storms was cavort-
ing around the place so the town popu-
lation held a meeting over in the box-car
station and by a unanimous vote on the
part of the agent and myself we decided
that the hero should be rewarded

  heretofore his sole occupation seemed
to be taking care of jed latroupes livery
barn and hanging around the post-of-
fice it was easy to see that a general
foreman had to have a chief clerk-so
easy to see that they could see it clear
from albuquerque and had already pro-
vided  from the monthly revenue of
the road for the compensation

  as the station - agent had to stay in
hearing of the telegraph instrument i
was appoined a committee to call at the
post-office and inform almost that as a
reward for heroism he would be allowed
to work a month for  and after that
more months if he liked it

getting protection

  it was also agreed that for the safety
of the public maggie mahorney should
be requested to lock the cannon in the safe

every night along with the dollars worth

of postage-stamps

  it just happened that a pusher engine
came in about that time and the united
states marshal drove in to take his prison-
er home i got them all together and it
was quite a respectable committee that
waited on almost that morning

  after showing the bunch that i was
there with the genuine oratory i told
almost we had decided that he should be
general foremans chief clerk at a salary
of forty-five semolians per month we
waited to hear his eloquent reply

  he made a noise like a long silence
that side-track smile of his spread out
until it looked more like a double tracked
main line and those freckles which were
not hidden by the black and blue spots
concealed themselves behind an unnatural
red

  after the ceremony he came around
to me for -instructions i took him down
to the pusher engine introduced him to
the shaker bar clinker rake and ash hoev
showed him how to get under the fire-
pan without taking off a driving-wheel-
and he went to work

getting the grates clean

  a couple of hours later i came back to
see how he was getting along im not
sure but i think he went over those grates
with a tooth-brush and a bottle of tooth
wash you could have climbed into the
fire-box or ash-pan with a dress suit on
without getting a black mark on your
boiled shirt

  after the inspection i told him that
he would some day be president of the
road but that didnt chase the troubled
expression off his rust-colored face

   mr thomas he says as i was start-
ing away  could two folks live on
 a month-if one of em was the post-
mistress

   almost i replied for that was the
nearest to the truth i could come at that
hour of the day  but a fireman makes
as much as three times that much i
added on second thought  and youll
be a fireman some day

  and i walked away

   in the next story about almost which will appear in our april issue certain com-
plications arise whereby the general foreman quits and the chief clerk strikes
pet names for trains

the cripple special the red cross special the cheese train
the  bum two and other pet and par-
ticular appellations

railroad men on some roads have a
way of giving pet names to their
trains for example a new freight-train
was recently placed on the new york cen-
tral running between syracuse and albany
this train has been dubbed  the red
cross special or the  cripple special
because its business is lo pick up all the
crippled cars along the line and take them
to the repairing shop at albany

  it is usual to have a particular train to
haul the crippled cars for obviously it
would not do to have a fast freight or
many of the other freights do this service
it is deemed good business to have one train
attend to this matter the  red cross
hauls other cars besides the cripples

  the men on the new york central have
other names for their trains the  morn-
ing glory  is a train which leaves albany
very early in the morning the  mohawk
is a freight which runs from new york to
albany without stopping and then it be-
gins to drop cars along the mohawk valley

   moonlight  is an adirondack summer
freight running to saranac lake and lakc-
placid starting out from utica at mid-
night bum two receives its name for
two reasons the symbol of this train is

bm- besides it has a lot of shifting to
do stopping along the way and a lot of
cut-up work to do trainmen do not like
to handle it and for this reason as well
as on account of the symbol it got the name
of  bum two

  the cheese train is a freight which
leaves utica in the morning and stops along
the dairying sections of the mohawk val-
ley at herkimer and little falls collecting
the cars loaded with cheese

  the turkey special is an annual ex-
press which starts at the st lawrence riv-
er and runs down through central new
york collecting turkeys and other fowl
for the thanksgiving trade

  the midnight drop is a freight which
runs out of albany and drops cars at various
stations up the valley

   u a   is called the fancy special
because it makes a fast run from syracuse
to albany in the autumn carrying fruit
trainmen like to run this special for they
can make a good wage in a few hours and
without any shunting

  the officials know their trains by sym-
bols but the men know them by pet names
as well as by symbols and the names are
always significant-e a s

the fight at battle draw

by earle c wight

           how the heat of a smoldering bitterness
           flared into a passionate flame of revenge

  had been talking
-about murder and
sudden death per-
sonal experiences
gathered before the
kid - glove period in
the west when every man was his own
judge whether or not he was the execu-
tioner depended upon his speed in draw-
ing

   do any of you happen to know how
this branch of the c and a acquired its
name asked the general manager ad-
dressing no one in particular the rest
of the party kept quiet rather afraid of
displaying their ignorance about a matter
of which they had never thought and not
inclined to hazard a guess before so au-
gust a person

  only the division engineer ventured
the opinion that he had heard rumors
from some of the old ranchers concerning
a particularly vicious mill during the
early construction days which had re-
sulted in christening the valley through
which the branch ran battle draw then
whether because his knowledge really was
limited or because he feared to interrupt
the story he knew was coming he lapsed
into silence

   the ranchers are right agreed the
general manager  it was a particularly
vicious mill it has been a long time ago
now all of you were probably in short
trousers at the time-that is all except
byrd here who was in dresses and whit-
ley who was present and will no doubt
correct me if i make a mistake ill tell
you about it if you like we nodded
assent and he leaned back on the soap-
box resting his head on one of the rough
logs which formed part of the wall of the
cabin

  i looked at whitley curiously the man
the general manager had mentioned as
being present wondering what part this
silent taciturn man could have taken in
the story we were about to hear not a
kindly part if his face and reputation
were evidence and nothing in his conduct
since he had been among us was likely to
cause a more favorable opinion harsh
and domineering his hold over his men
was entirely through fear

  officially he was calhouns private
secretary but that was only a blind
really he was his right-hand man draw-
ing a salary in proportion i know this
because a friend of mine in the cashiers
office told me his salary was fifteen thou-
sand a year a big salary for a secretary
to a general manager but then the gen-
eral manager was no more what his title
implied than was the secretary

  it had seemed a little strange when
whitley on this rough - and - tumble in-
spection tour had guessed to a foot the
fall of battle creek and later a sudden
shower sending us to cover the manager
led with unerring steps to the tumble-
down cabin but the one we iiad credited
to a clever guess the other to a lucky
chance for which we were duly grateful

  the private secretary scowled in the
general managers direction  i wouldnt
tell that story he remarked softly  bet-
ter let sleeping dogs lie the interrup-
tion went unnoticed it is doubtful if the
general manager even heard it busily
lighting a black cigar

   it was just after i came from mex- 
ico he began  some time in the early
seventies if my memory serves me we
had completed the yucatan and guadala-
jara extension the work taking us from
an elevation of seven thousand feet to be-


the fight at battle draw



low sea-level through as dismal a swamp
as a mosquito ever called home

   the result was that after i reached
denver on my way east i was taken with
a severe attack of malaria it shook and
froze and burned me until i was little
more than a living skeleton another
man could have been tucked very com-
fortably inside my clothes without crowd-
ing me very much it was ridiculous the
way they flapped about me every time 
struck a street corner where there was a
current of air

   but that was later though for the
first two months i merely laid in bed ab-
sorbing calomel and quinin  such quan-
tities that i wont test your credulity by
stating that before it was over the doctors
gave up pleasuring the doses by grains
and went to handfuls

  how is mr calhoun to-day i
heard one of the physicians ask a nurse

    a little better i think she an-
swered   he only shook two bricks from

the left - tower chimney last night as
against five the night before

    cut the doses then directed the
doctor  make it a quart of quinin and a
pint of calomel every hour that was
the way it seemed to me anyhow

   when they did finally discharge me
cured i found myself in rather a bad
way physically weak and so poorly off
financially that it was necessary to aban-
don my trip home and find some kind of
work i found it at last in the office of
the d and r b

  hum said the chief clerk to
whom i applied for a job  you look
more fitted for a side-show than an engi-
neering corps i took a long breath and
tried to fill out my clothes but they only
bellied and happed in the draft from a
fan he had  his desk  whats the
trouble   he asked   have you stolen an-
other mans suit or are jrou half of the
siamese twins  i explained the circum-
stances and showed him my letters

-a

didnt they tell you at the office
that another man had been
sent ahead of you  
the railroad mans magazine



    we might use-you he conceded
 always provided you reach camp in one
piece i assured him i could hang to-
gether that long

    here -he went on picking up one

picking his way carefully along the top
of a narrow ridge sam the mule tugged
now and then at the lead rope tempted
from the path of duty by a patch of green
behind me lay miles of mountain and

of the letters- is one which says you are
a good transitman we happen to be in
need of such as the present one is hardly
satisfactory the position will pay ninety
a month how does that strike you  

  when do i start i said-eager to
close the bargain he led me to a map
of colorado hanging on the wall  now
here indicating with a blue pencil  is
denver this spot is pagosa springs
how long will it take you to reach it
i calculated the distance with my eye
noting the roughness of the country as
compared with my own feeble condition

    three weeks i hazarded

    good   he said   your pay starts
now to-morrow you will find a horse
and pack - mule at goodwins corral
come here at ten for your last instruc-
tions

  just twenty days later my horse was

valley just beginning to clothe them-
selves in summer attire in the heads of
the draws faint patches of damp earth
showed where winter had made a last
desperate stand

   i was beginning to get a little wor-
ried for according to my calculations i
was close to where the party should be
a preliminary survey is a difficult thing
to miss in a wooded country where the
cutting is ten feet wide but i had crossed
bare valleys and flats where the only in-
dications would be trampled grass and an
occasional stake luck was with me
however for very shortly i found it-a
wide swath cut in the brush and small
timber half-way up a heavily covered hill-
side

   my horse stumbled over a blue-
keeled stake marked  as they had
told me in denver that i should probably
the fight at

battle draw



find the camp close to the  mark i
was by now within two miles of my desti-
nation a half - hours traveling along
the line brought me to headquarters six
white tents pitched in the head of a draw
beside a small stream not a very luxu-
rious outfit but after three weeks of con-
stant riding and sleeping on the ground
they seemed the height of civilization

   the place seemed deserted only a
thin curl of smoke from the cook-shack
set a little apart indicated the presence
of men i called several times before any-
one answered  then the flap of the largest
tent was thrown aside and a tall flaj-
backed young fellow came out

    there are some people whom you dis-
like instinctively at first for no apparent
reason that you could explain to yourself
you dislike them that is enough in this
case the feeling seemed mutual for he
pulled his hat low on his head and stood
scowling at me from beneath the brim

  well what do you want he said
finally

    the tone didnt exactly suit me but
 let it pass

     im looking for the locating engi-
neer i answered mildly

     well he repeated impatiently

   so this was the man i was to work
under things looked squally for me
if he continued in this attitude i could
see where they would need another transit-
jnan very shortly i handed him the let-
ter they had armed me with before set-
ting out

    here i had the first suspicion that
everything was not as it should be in-
stead of opening it at once lie hesitated
looked at me then down at the letter in
his hand and with the air of a man who
has gone too far to draw back tore it
open he read it slowly tearing it into
small pieces which he ground into the
earth i took this for the end of the in-
terview and threw one leg over the pom-
mel preparatory to sliding from the sad-
dle

    one minute he halted me  im
sorry but youre too late

     too late for what  i asked blank-
ly-

  too late for the job its already
been filled didnt they tell you at the
office that another man had been sent
ahead of you

   they hadnt said anything about it
and i told him so frankly  moreover
i added warmly  the man who played a
trick like that deserved to herd sheep
at that time this was equivalent to a
pretty strong oath

    i suppose he said indifferently
 they wanted to be sure one of you would
reach here

    then there is nothing for me to do
but-

   to go back and  would advise
he continued looking at the sun  that
you start at once if you want to reach the
divide by sundown

   i ignored the hint and tumbled off
the disappointment was keen for i had
counted on at least five months work and
denver was barren of jobs but knock-
ing around a man gets hardened to ill
luck so i tried to take it philosophically

     with your permission then i said
 ill get a couple of good-meals and start
back in the morning

   his eyes narrowed a trifle  as far
as a meal is concerned youre welcome to
that  but we havent a spare cot in camp
it just dawned upon me that he was
trying to run me off  that for some rea-
son he was determined i should not spend
the night with the party ordinarily 
would have been only too glad to have
left a place where it had been so clearly
shown i was unwelcome  but for the sake
of three decent meals and a night under
canvas i was willing to intrude

    the cot wont matter i said cas
ually  its the breakfast that appeals to
me

     there will be no breakfast for you
he said grimly  as you seem rather hard
of comprehension ill put it frankly
you are not wanted here to-night if
youre- hungry the cook will rustle some-
thing for you though he added as if to
soften the bluntness of his refusal

   on the way to the cook-shack i tried
to make up my mind what was the best
course to pursue many things had struck
me as peculiar about my host the
hesitancy about opening my letter was
one its destruction was another and
strangest of all his ill-concealed desire
to be rid of my presence -to a few men
in a lonely place the advent of a stranger
is an occurrence and it is a very peculiar
camp that would not make him welcome


the railroad mans magazine

   either that or there was something
crooked going on it was really none of
my business if the company was being
cheated after the way it had treated me
but  was curious the experience of
being literally forced out of camp was
unique and i determined if it were pos-
sible to find out the reason with this
idea in view i ate so heartily and talked
so much that my inhospitable host-he
refused to allow me out of his sight-
began to grow restless

   on my suggesting that my animals
could stand some food and water he vol-
unteered to attend to it warning me as
he left that it was getting late when
he was well out of hearing i turned my
attention to the cook

    nice cheerful fellow that canby
i remarked

  who him that aint canby

    but thats the name they gave me in
denver i objected

     son youre in the right church but
the wrong pew canbys an oldish man
with gray whiskers do you think id
mistake them two after living with them
for two months 

     then who is lie 

   the cook lowered his voice confiden-
tially  that is the transitman and
they do say he is going to be canned

   that one sentence gave me the key to
the whole situation it was so plain now
that i wondered at not seeing it before
all the circumstances pointed to one
thing and that had such a nasty look that
it was hard to believe a white man was
capable of it the way it figured out was
this

   the transitman knew he was to be
discharged through living with the lo
catingengineer which of course he did-
that being camp etiquette-he had man-
aged to find out about the time i would
arrive the rest was easy he had only
to feign some excuse for staying in camp
and by passing himself off as the chief
turn me away with the story of a new
man who had antedated my arrival

   he was smart enough to know that
my story would never be believed at the
office they would put it down that i
had lost my way and had invented this
yarn to excuse myself the cook might
never mention the fact that he had enter-
tained a visitor or if he did i could be

passed off as a wandering prospector who
had grown tired of his own cooking

   there was one link which was not
quite connected after that was joined
the chain would be complete

    perhaps it would be a good thing
for him if he did i said replying to the
cook  a sick man has no right to be
out in the open like this he ought to see
a doctor

   the cook grunted  sick nothin he
eats like a hoss its my opinion that hes
layin down because he knows whats corn-
in

   the evidence was all in i thanked
the cook and told him id probably see
him again a wave of heat blew in my
face as i entered the largest tent the
interior was just the same as a thousand
i have seen under the same conditions
two smooth pine boards resting on tres-
tles and covered with maps instruments
sacks of tobacco and a gun in the
back corners were two cots covered with
navajo blankets a rope was stretched
under the ridge-pole from which were
suspended some blue shirts and a pair of
khaki trousers

   my host was lying on one of the cots
reading he looked up and smiled pleas-
antly when he saw me

     going  he asked

     staying i answered seating myself
on the vacant cot

   he avas on his feet in an instant
 have you so soon forgotten what i told
you no man stays here at night with-
out my permission

    i rolled a cigarette slowly before an-
swering beads of perspiration bedewed
his forehead before the last grain of to-
bacco was tucked in its place he didnt
dare say anything for fear of giving him-
self away for while he probably feared
the worst he could not tell just how much

i	had guessed

   i threw the match away and faced
him squarely  do you know i said

 ive a great desire to know whom im ad-
dressing never mind that i went on
as ire started to tell his candid opinion
of my ancestors  the question now is
what cards do you hold you are called
what have you  

     a full hand of clubs he said show-
ing he had a sense of humor  out in
front is a good place for a sliow-down
the fight at battle draw



   i was agreeable and we had the show-
down with the cook for referee when
it was over and he was able we shook
hands and patched up a story to explain
his battered face

   so that was how this came to be named
battle draw said byrd

   not a bit of it we havent come to
that part yet eh whitley 

  the private secretary shook his head
gloomily  at this rate you will have
them all thinking i was the scoundrel

from here if the rain would let up like
everything else it had its day but has
long since played out

   the man who tried to trick me was
still with us working sometimes with the
leverman helping the draftsman or with
our party as occasion arose we had
never become very friendly but thrown
together as we were at work at play
and meals we had adopted an armed
truce for the sake of the peace of the
camp

no man stays here at night without my permission

who tried to get your job my back is
flat and i was with you then

   nonsense man laughed the general
manager  this is only a story to kill time
until the rain stops but to go on a
month passed and we had worked nearly
down to the mouth of the valley perhaps
a mile from where we are now there
was a small settlement here then-a dozen
houses and a couple of saloons the one
were in now was the headquarters of the
superintendent rather larger and better
built than the others

   their excuse for being was the silver
slipper mine which could be easily seen

   	r r

   he knew and i knew that the ac-
count was not closed that something
more decisive than a rough-and-tumble
was needed to balance the books in the
meantime we waited

   at noon one day a guide rode up with
a bagful of mail we fell on it eagerly
for mail only arrived once a month

    what do you think of this asked
canby presently looking up from the let-
ter he was reading  the office writes
that sid lyons is camping on our trail
he is working for the overland you
know who likewise are thinking of build-
ing into pagosa isnt that the deuce


the railroad mans magazine

they also warn us to look out for his
crowd

    who is he  i asked for the name
had been mentioned several times in the
same tone the russians might have spoken
of napoleon

    the biggest meanest proposition in
the engineering business said canby
 he is the raven of war the harbinger
of trouble if a nice hot fight took
place without his being there hed weep
we might as well quit if it comes

   i could hardly believe my ears nine
husky young americans-nine and a
half counting the cook-afraid of a name
the others took it as a matter of course
if lyons came they quit their accept-
ance of his fighting abilities was so nat-
ural that i should have been warned
instead i rushed in

    there is one thing we might do
i suggested  we might run him off

   the boys hooted evidently i had
displayed vast ignorance which amused
my companions i could feel the color
surging into my face at their jeers one
mans the only one in the crowd whose
laughter i minded sounded a little con-
temptuous

  if he will only stay away another
month we might finish said canby

    if he comes before then i remarked
looking hard at the man whose place i
had taken  ill see that he leaves our
work alone

  no one said anything more for they
saw i was angry but there was a pleased
smile on the face of the man who had
baited me the opportunity for which he
had waited had come and he had seized it

   lyons didnt wait for us to finish a
week later on going back to check some
angles we found every stake on the line
pulled up when two surveyors are
fighting each other this is the usual
method of proclaiming war

   we had our maps of course but the
state laws say the survey must be com-
plete before they can be filed and with-
out the stakes actually in the ground the
maps were useless paralleling ours was
another line with a full party at work
it was not difficult to guess the culprits

    all off for camp sang out the chief
i looked at him in astonishment

    well he said flushing  there is no
good in fighting lyons

   i pulled his gun from his holster
mine interfered with the needle of the
transit so i didnt carry it

     youre too timid a man i said  to
carry such a dangerous weapon go on
with your work and let me attend to this
matter

   a rodman on the new line told me
their chief was at the settlement half-
way there the ex-transitman overtook me

    thought id see you through he
said briefly falling into step then and
there i buried all hard feeling what
he had done before was forgotten

   he was man enough to overlook our
personal differences in the new crisis
which confronted us also he was the
only one of the boys with courage to join
me after i saw our man i was better
able to appreciate that courage for he
wasnt walking into it blindly the way i
was

   we found lyons sitting on the steps
of one of these shanties he had taken for
an office he was the biggest fighting
man ive ever seen my heart failed me
for a moment he was so formidable

   under his shirt his chunky shoulders
-he was over six feet one so you can
guess how broad he was to make him look
that compact-were creased and ribbed
with muscles his neck was set so close
to his body that an inch ribbon would
have choked him to death

    with all his size there wasnt a pound
of fat on him when he walked it was
right on his toes as though he had springs
in his feet so i knew he was quick and
not clumsy i began to feel sorry for
myself but it was too late then

    good evening i said politely it
was easy to be polite to him

   he didnt answer me continuing to
study the profile in his hands so i sat
down and rolled a cigarette when he
had finished his calculation he looked up

    well sonny what can i do for
you 

     oh i said trying to be sarcastic

 i just came here to admire your form
dont bother to talk to me

    how are your stakes this morning 
he came back

    i dont know i answered truthful-
ly   havent seen them

   he grinned at that  is that what
you came to see me about  
 the fight at battle draw



   i said it was and added what i serve or give you a good thrashing which
thought of a man who played the game would be letting you off easy
so unfairly	  hey jack he shouted to one of a

my hand went thudding against something that crackled sharply

 what would you have me do he
 asked  put them back  

   that would be the decent thing
 i said  but i hardly expect you to do
 it

   then what do you expect 

   to keep you away from our line we
 can repair the damage you have already
 done but this is to warn you not to re-
 peat it

   and if i do  he sneered

   there are two things i might do i
 said slowly  i might shoot you as you de-

 group of miners  heres a young buck
 who wants a light they came crowding
 over laughing at the prospect

   when would you like to be spanked
 he asked  now or in a year or two when
 you are fully grown

   this evening i retorted  now

  he was a little taken back by my
 prompt acceptance even then i think
 he thought it all a bluff

   suit yourself he said  will some
 one hold my coat 

  my companion came forward taking


the railroad mans magazine

both our coats and i didnt see him again
until the trouble was over it made me a
little shaky being left alone with that
big brute and those strangers

   the feeling did not last long for im-
mediately i was kept busy trying to dodge
the vicious blows which lyons aimed at
me any one of which had it landed where
he intended would have ended the fight
he was like a cat on his feet and with
his tremendous strength was the best man
i ever met

   every time a blow landed it left the
marks of his clenched hand outlined in
red on my skin once he hit so hard
that he lifted me clear off my feet close
to two hundred pounds i weighed too

   the realization came to me very

shortly that he was more than my equal
and that only luck stood between me and
a bad beating so far it had favored me
he was unable to break through my guard
and reach my face

   by the end of five minutes he had
punched me into pretty bad shape it
was agony to breathe while my knees
felt as though they would give way every
minute he saw it and came after me
all the harder there was no time called 
it was fight fight fight with the miners
cheering us on

   i could only block and stall now
waiting and hoping for my one chance
twice it came the first time when he
tripped and nearly fell but my blow went
high nearly breaking my hand against

then-the sharp metallic
report of a pistol 
the fight at

battle draw



his head the second time he struck
too quick overreaching himself leaving a
narrow opening to his chin

   i struck with the desperate knowl-
edge that this was my last chance my
hand went thudding against some thing
that crackled sharply and lyons went
toppling over backward

   he rose before any one could help
him hoarsely demanding his coat one of
the miners handed it to him

   at the same time i felt something
thrust into my hand

    shoot quick the person behind me
whispered mechanically i raised the gun
and fired twice through the smoke i saw
lyonss gun the cylinder revolving rapid-
ly in the light of the setting sun but
no report answered mine slowly his
hand fell to his side and again he tum-
bled heavily to the ground

   that is all of the story i think we
finished our survey without interference
from the other party the miners who
had witnessed the fight gave the name
battle creek to their settlement and so
it went in on our maps

   by the way jim there is one tiling
that has always puzzled me the gen-
eral manager leaned forward his cigar
glowing redly against the grayish back-
ground

   that gun was not my own you
ought to be able to explain it you were
there

  an inarticulate sound caused him to
pause  i mean he went on hastily
 that you were with the party that
you were in probably a better position
to know the details than i

  instead of answering whitley rose
and groped his way to the door where he
stood a long time looking into the driz-
zling gloom it was one of those situations
when to speak is a mistake to keep silent
is worse only the drip of falling water
where the rain had found a hole in the
rotting roof broke the quiet

  the general managers face was a pic-
ture of regret and pain as he watched the
motionless back of his old friend when
the monotonous sound of splashing drops
threatened to become unbearable he
rose stiffly seating himself again as
whitley turned around with one hand
concealed in his pocket whitley stepped
swiftly back to his old place

   calhoun he said and there was a
note in his voice which kept us quiet
 the event you have just told took place
over thirty years ago and ive waited just
that long for you to do what you have
done when you began i warned you to
let sleeping dogs lie later i gave you
a chance to leave me out

   had you taken heed there would be
no necessity for what is going to happen
but you didnt now thanks to your
blunders all these men know it was i
who tried to save my job by lying to
you that it was i whom you thrashed
that day and they have probably guessed
likewise that i changed the guns abstract-
ing the cartridges from the wrong one 

   but jim-

  the secretarys words beat down the
protest  youve had your say its my
turn now dont you know you fool
that there could be only two reasons for
my continued service to you-love or hate
did you imagine it was the former  he
laughed wildly  over thirty years ac-
cumulation of bitterness for this one mo-
ment-but by heaven its worth it 

  then-the sharp metallic report of a
pistol like a shadow whitley slipped
past the hands reached out for him the
general managers big body seemed to
shrink the black stump of his cigar fell
from his fingers and he slid forward into
the fire

  whitley was never brought to justice
but if you ever come across a tall flat-
backed man with a face all iron and
stone eating his heart out in some god-
forsaken place you might tell him what
ive told you

a shattered hope

m very sorry sir but mr war-
  rington is engaged and can
  see no one this morning

     the private secretary of
andrew warrington the gen-
eral manager of the chicago
st louis and western railroad glanced
at a card bearing the name  frederick
erskine the visitor was a stalwart
gray-clad young fellow with dark clean-
cut features

   ive come seven hundred miles to see
him he explained

   did mr warrington askyou to
call the private secretary asked

   yes replied the other  mr war- 
rington writing to me last week told me
to call on him at my earliest convenience
the letter came to my hands two days
ago i arrived in the city this morning

  the private secretary frowned slight-
ly and hesitated

   is it a matter of importance  he
asked

   to me it is a matter of very con-
siderable importance erskine answered
with a smile

   i will take your card to mr war-
rington gerrick said

  the private secretary crossed the room
with reluctant steps and entered an inner
apartment at a large llat-topped desk
sat andrew warrington the general man-
ager of the road slightly above medium
height he was sturdily built and about
fifty-five years of age his hair and mus-

tache were gray and his neck and hands
were large and muscular

  his face was broad and resolute but
on it this morning had settled a care-
worn expression and his eyes were blood-
shot he gripped the arms of his chair
and as he glanced at gerrick he frowned
irritably

   what is it tom   he demanded
shortly a card confound it didnt
i tell you that i would see  one this
morning 

   yes sir but-

  who is it

   frederick erskine who says he came
 here at your request

  warrington scowled hesitated then
took the card which gerrick held out to
him he looked at it thoughtfully for
a moment motioning abruptly toward
a wire basket he addressed gerrick

   theres a letter there tom-a letter
 from old sam erskine one of our loco-
 motive engineers find it for me please

  gerrick found the paper tind laid it on
 the desk

   read it directed the general man-
 ager

  gerrick read

 friend andy-it aint in my mind to
 spring  new bother  you after all
 the kind things you have done for me
 and mine but four years ago when my
 boy fycd went into the altoona shops
 after you had helped me to put him
 through columbia university you made
 me promise that when he left altoona
 i would send him to you so as you could
 look him over well andy hes gone
 through the whole altoona course with
 colors flying and the folks down there




the railroad mans magazine

has writ to me that all of them is proud

  of him

    for forty years the old c s l and w
  has been good enough for me so im
  sending the boy round to you look him
  over andy and if he sizes up to you
  half as big as he looks to me like as not
  them pennsylvania fellers will have to
  snoop a little further for a future presi-
  dent of their company

    well anyhow andy its up to you
  fred is still hanging round altoona do-
  ing a special stunt or two and any time
  you want to see him all you will have
  to do is just to drop him a line the lad
  is honest and earnest and is so up in the
  higher branches of railroading that lie
  just naturally ought to be ashamed of a
  daddy that never got no further along
  than the cab of a locomotive while his
  old fireman andy warrington was get-
  ting to be the general manager of the
  road but the boy is just fool enough
  to be as proud of me as i am of him and
  it dont matter how small a berth you
  shove him into hell make his way and
  be a credit to you and

yours truly

                     sam erskine

 andrew warrington thrust the letter
back on the desk and again gripping
the arms of his chair turned thoughtfully
toward one of the windows gerrick
continued to regard him speculatively

  tell him to come in the general
manager said grumpily

 gerrick nodded and went out in a
moment the door opened again and the
visitor entered he moved a few paces
in the direction of the man he saw seated
at the desk

 it was the first time that the young
man had seen this old friend of his
fathers and it was scarcely more than
natural that he should look for some
manifestation of cordiality on the part
of one whom he long had regarded as
a benefactor strangely enough however
the general manager turning slowly to-
ward him looked at him dully and with-
out speaking

 the young man stopped bowed and
glanced inquiringly at the sturdy figure
and pale careworn face of the man at
the desk

  mr warrington i believe said
erskine smiling slightly

 the general manager passed a hand
over his eves

   yes-yes he answered absently
then after a pause he added you
are sam erskines boy

   yes sir replied the stalwart six-
footer easily  and first of all i want
to thank you for all you have done for
me

  warrington shook his head gravely
you have little to thank me for i am
afraid he said with-a sigh  the only
persons who set a price on their advice
are lawyers and physicians the rest
of us give it more cheerfully than we
accept it such financial aid as i have
given to your father was less than i of-
fered and he has repaid me dollar for
dollar my old friend would have- done
better perhaps had he refrained from
mentioning the subject to you

  the young man smiled shook his head
incredulously and advanced with his
right hand extended  permit me to
thank you now he said

  the general manager half rose from
his chair and grasped the hand that his
visitor held out to him  sit down
warrington said perfunctorily

  erskine nodded and seated himself on
a chair near the desk

   and so you are done at altoona
warrington muttered as leaning for-
ward he rested his elbows on the arms
of his chair

   yes i finished the course six weeks
ago

  the general managers lips were com-
pressed as he gazed meditatively at the
old mans letter

   your father tells me that you want
to enter the service of the c s l and
w said warrington at last

  the young man smiled  yes he an-
swered

  for a minute the general manager
gazing moodily at his desk was silent
then speaking deliberately he said

   well my boy im sorry but in the
service of this company there is no post
that i can offer you

chapter ii
working in the dark

 s the general manager spoke fred
erskine started flushed and looked
at him incredulously
without lights



  andrew warrington who had entered
the employ of the c s l- and w as a
fireman on a locomotive more than thirty
years before now was regarded as one of
the most able railroad men in the united
states he had occupied the post of gen-
eral manager for twelve years and for
several months it had been rumored that
as a result of a series of differences be-
tween him and henry burbridge the
president of the company the directors
were disposed to compel burbridge to re-
sign and to make warrington his suc-
cessor

  some of this gossip had reached the
ears of fred erskine prior to his visit to
chicago and had done much to encourage
his belief that his advancement in the
service of the company in which this old
friend of his fathers was so powerful was
likely to be much more rapid than he
would find it elsewhere

  old sam erskine had been a loyal em-
ployee of the c s l and w for forty
years and it had been his sole ambition
to give to his only son an education that
would enable him to make his way upward
as andrew warrington had done war-
rington as has been seen had afforded
material aid in this direction and it was
in accordance with the advice of the gen-
eral manager that erskine had applied
for admission to the altoona shops after
he had completed a scientific course at
columbia university

  to most persons other than railroad
men altoona is nothing more than a
smoky town in pennsylvania in which
are located the repair and construction
shops and several important offices of the
pennsylvania railroad to the railroad
man of high or low degree however it
stands for all that west point means to
the officers and enlisted men of the united
states army or all that the naval acad-
emy at annapolis represents to the navy
it is the worlds greatest training school
for railway officials and its influence is
world-wide

  in the course of the long pause that
succeeded warringtons statement the ex-
pression of incredulity that had settled
on erskines face gave place to one of
wonder and chagrin warringtons face
was pale and grim as he continued to
gaze at the letter that lay before him on
the desk

  erskine was the first to break the si
lence nodding resignedly he said
quietly

   i am very sorry to hear you say so
sir what your reasons may be for this
decision i do not know of course in
view of all that you have done for my
father and for me however i hope that
neither my father nor myself has done
anything to displease you

   on the contrary i regard my rela-
tions with your father and indirectly
with you as among the more satisfactory
of my experiences replied the general
manager moodily

  erskine was trying to formulate some
appropriate words of farewell when he
suddenly became conscious of the fact
that the general manager was eying him
with a new expression of interest after
an approving glance over the tall ath-
letic figure of his visitor warrington
critically studied the young mans face

   sit down he said for young ers-
kine had risen to go

  as erskine seated himself again the
general manager leaned back in his chair
and gazing at his desk slowly stroked
his chin the young man watched him
curiously

   fred warrington went  abruptly
after a pause  you made a pretty good
run of it through college i believe

   why yes sir-i did pretty well
faltered the young fellow

   i have been more particularly in-
formed concerning your work in altoona
and on your performances there i con-
gratulate you with all my heart war-
rington went   there is only one
thing that i hold against you

  indeed exclaimed erskine an ex-
pression of apprehension in his eyes

   yes it is that you are sam erskines
son instead of mine

  the general manager turning slowly
to and fro in his swivel - chair gazed
thoughtfully at the floor as he continued
 and yet my boy i think i can easily
forgive you that for you have in your
veins the blood of one of the bravest and
most honest men i have ever known
warrington nervously tapped  his
desk with a penholder

   when i say that in the service of
this company there is  position that f
can offer you t speak the truth at the


the railroad mans magazine

time i wrote to you asking you to come
to chicago i designed offering you a
good position much has happened since
then however and in place of the friend
who was preparing to help you you now
find a discredited man whose career is
about to end in disaster unless-

  an expression of blank astonishment
came to erskines face but in a moment it
was gone

   unless the general manager con-
tinued leaning forward  unless i can
enlist in my personal service a man whom
i can trust implicitly and who possesses
qualifications which will enable him to
pursue without exciting suspicion a cer-
tain course of inquiry that may lead him
into several departments of this railroad 

  warrington tossed the penholder back
on his desk and drummed nervously on
the arms of his chair as he went on

   until you entered this room just now
i was at a loss to know where to turn to
find a man who was capable of meeting
these requirements it now occurs to me
however that you possess the necessary
qualifications your course at altoona
has familiarized you with various kinds
of departmental work and you have the
additional advantage of being unknown
to all the employeesof this company ex-
cept your father in the course of your
quest you probably will have no occasion
to meet your father and it will be in
your interest as well as mine that you
say nothing to him concerning the task
which i am about to ask you to under-
take

   my relations with you are to be re-
garded as secret then  the young man
asked

   they must not be known to any per-
son other than ourselves

  erskine nodded and leaned back in his
chair the general manager rose and
locked the door

  as briefly as-possible i will describe
to you the situation that now confronts
me he began  eleven months ago the
dunbar construction company of den-
ver deposited in the office of the treasurer
of this company bonds valued at five hun-
dred thousand dollars which were to
guarantee the performance of that com-
panys contract to construct for us a
branch line from cardis to redmount in
the state of wyoming that work is

now almost complete and in another
month the dunbar company will as a
matter of course make a demand upon us
for the return of the bonds you will
see therefore what a predicament we are
in when  tell ypu that the bonds are no
longer in our possession

  erskine looked more intently at the
careworn face before him

   the bonds are lost he asked

   stolen replied the general manager
grimly  as nearly as can be learned
they disappeared from the vault of our
companys treasurer about five days ago

   is any one under suspicion

    yes

   some one emploved in the treasurers
office

   yes the suspect is a young man
who living beyond his salary and the
allowance made to him by his father
some months ago became involved in a
series of unfortunate speculations as a
result of these speculations his father was
compelled to pay nearly a quarter of a
million dollars to the young mans cred-
itors

   the son failed to take to heart the
lesson taught by his unfortunate experi-
ences taking advantage of his restored
credit he again plunged into debt-this
time as a common gambler on the very
day that this fact became known to his
father the bonds were missed from the
vault of the office in which he was em-
ployed and the combination which con-
trolled the lock of the vault was known
to him

  he protests that he is innocent and
thus far he has been allowed to continue
to work in the office detectives have been
put to work on the case but-

  the general manager paused and looked
meditatively out of one of the windows

    but there are certain incidents in con-
nection with the affair that have not been
brought to their knowledge lie added
 if you will undertake the task you will
be better informed

   am i to understand then that i
have to discover who it was took the miss-
ing bonds   erskine asked

   you are to find the bonds and cause
them to be returned to the vault the
general manager replied  the bonds
are all that i will require of you so far
as i am concerned you have carte blanche
without lights



to get them by fair means or by foul
and i will give you all the aid that lies
within my power to give

    if you fail it will be quite unneces-
sary for you to trouble me with any ex-
planation of your failure if you do get
them you are at perfect liberty to keep
to yourself all knowledge of the means
which you may find it necessary to employ
it is not essential that i be informed of
the name of the thief his identity will
be entirely your affair-and his is this
much clear to you 

   erskines face wore a puzzled expres-
sion but it was without hesitation that he
answered

    perfectly

   and i hope that it will be equally
clear to you that you must carefully guard
the fact that you are acting as my repre-
sentative in the matter warrington went
on  i will supply all funds that may
be necessary and if it should be found
expedient to have you represent yourself
as an employee of this company from
time to time i will find means to have
you do so but after midnight to-night
you are under no circumstances to ask
me for advice concerning the manner in
which you are to proceed

   you must map out your own cam-
paign after you hear from me an account
of those incidents concerning which the
detectives have not been informed you
must regard those detectives as working
against you for if they instead of you
recover the bonds you will have failed in
your quest in view of the fact that these
detectives report to and receive instruc-
tions from certain officials of this com-
pany we may regard them as working in
the light

   you must be the man in the dark
depending only on your own resources
and making no report to any one if you
work into an embarrassing position and
find yourself in deep water you must not
call on me to aid you you must swim or
sink-alone

  fred erskine abstractedly placed his
hat on his head  then thrusting his hands
into the pockets of his trousers he rose
and slowly paced to and fro the gen-
eral manager leaned back and clasped his
hands over one knee and surveyed his
visitor speculatively

    you are giving me a pretty big order

mr warrington said the young man
moodily

   pretty big assented the general
manager with a nod

   would it not be better to entrust a
matter of this nature to a professional
detective erskine asked

   no warrington answered shortly
 the professional detective is too well
trained in the betrayal of confidences to
have a matter of this sort entrusted to his
keeping the manner in which you have
acquitted yourself in college and at al-
toona indicates that you have more than
the average degree of intelligence in
addition to this you have the eyes and
chin of your father and these are suffi-
cient to assure me of your honesty and
grit

   moreover you will have a personal
interest in the matter that no professional
detective could feel if you succeed i
shall become president of this road and
next to your father i will prove to be the
best friend you have on earth if you
fail another month will find me a ruined
man who will be unable to offer any sort
of aid to the son of his old friend

  for some time both were silent then
erskine spoke

   you are putting it to me pretty
strongly mr warrington he said

  if you hesitate perhaps i can put it
to you still more strongly the general
manager replied

  the young man ceasing to pace the
floor stopped in front of warrington and
looked at him curiously

   who is the man who is under sus-
picion  he asked quietly

  there was a pause then in a low
hard voice the general manager an-
swered 

   joe warrington-my son 

chapter iii

fred takes a job

the color fled from fred erskines
     cheeks

   your son  he faltered

  warrington nodded and his gaze fell

   but he will clear himself-of course
the young man said

   i hope so warrington replied
 but whether he does this or not the


the railroad mans magazine

package of bonds must be obtained by
you and thirty day must suffice for the
accomplishment of the task thus far
the knowledge of their loss is supposed
to be restricted to four officials of this
road and the detectives who have been
put to work on the case

   how many detectives are engaged i
do not know but i believe there are no
more than three one of them however
is glen streyer an exceptionally success-
ful private detective who has been spe-
cially engaged by mr burbridge the
president of our company

   streyer seems to be acting independ-
ently of the others who are regular
railroad detectives working under the
direction of mr stanwood our treasurer
from whose office the bonds were taken
one other official than these- i- have
mentioned is informed concerning the
circumstances of the theft this is lewis
yarnell our vice-president with none
of these however are you to have any-
thing to do

  erskine removing his hat sank into a
chair and looked at warrington dubi-
ously

  then it is scarcely probable that i
will have access to the treasurers office 
he said

    it is unnecessary that you should pur-
sue any part of your investigation there
the general manager returned

   but-

   i have said that i would acquaint you
with certain incidents concerning which
the detectives know nothing warring-
ton explained  the facts as known to
the detectives are these the bonds were
issued by the south wendham electric
company the pan-american trading
company and the fairfield steel corpo-
ration all were contained in two black
tin boxes which were placed on one of
the- shelves of the vault

   the boxes were found on the shelf
but their contents were gone how the
bonds were taken from the vault is still
a mystery the vault combination was
known only to two men-stanwood our
treasurer and my son it was stanwood
who discovered the loss and he at once
reported the matter to president bur-
bridge

   the bonds are negotiable

    yes

   and their loss has not been reported
to the companies by which the bonds were
issued 

   no and i think it will not be diffi-
cult for you to understand why no such
report has been made only as a last
resort must publicity be given to the mat-
ter one of two men was guilty either
of deliberate theft or of almost criminal
negligence in failing to keep the vault
properly locked

    of these men one was the treasurer of
the company and the other was the son
of the companys general manager more
than this it is for many reasons desirable
that the dunbar company should not
know of the loss if it is in any way pos-
sible for us to recover them

  erskine shook his head doubtfully

   under these circumstances the detec-
tives are likely to have little outside help
in their attejnpts to discover a possible
transfer of the bonds he said

   true replied warrington  the
task will indeed be a difficult one if they
are honest enough to adhere to the letter
of their instructions glen streyer is
crafty however and i do not regard it
as at all improbable that taking the bit
between his teeth he will invoke the aid
of the companies that issued the bonds
without informing his employers of his
action

   and if streyer recovers any or all
of the bonds he-

  he will deliver them to burbridge
in whose -interests he is working this is
what we must prevent the bonds must
be returned to the safe without bur-
bridges knowledge

  again erskine rose and began to pace
the floor the expression of perplexity
on his face was momentarily growing
deeper

   it seems to me mr warrington that
you are assuming that the bonds were in-
deed taken by your son  he said thought-
fully

  the general manager cleared his throat
and hesitated

  my son denies that he took them
of course warrington answered dryly
then after another pause he added
 but if stanwood took them the result
would be the same

   the result would be the same  re-
peated erskine incredulously
without lights



    precisely- replied the general man-
ager  and now i will tell you of the
incidents which the detectives are not
taking under consideration first then
burbridge would be ousted from the presi-
dency of this road and i would be elected
as his successor at the next annual meet-
ing of the stockholders six months hence
if this unfortunate affair had not hap-
pened

    if it is proved that my son did in-
deed take the bonds  will he required
to make good their value i cannot do so
the result will be that i a discredited
man will have to sever my relations with
this company now stanwood is a mere
tool of burbridges and would fall with
burbridge it was in accordance with a
suggestion made by stanwood that my
son was made his assistant

   erskines face- brightened  then it
is possible that some sort of a job has
been put up on your son by burbridge and
stanwood  he said

    it is possible warrington assented
 but if this is so we will have to prove
it and in such a case we may be pretty
sure that the bonds still are in the pos-
session of the original thief on the other
-hand if my son took them they probably
are in the hands of some other person to
whom they have been given as security
for a loan it will be necessary there-
fore for you first to learn by whom the
bonds were taken then to find them and
return them to the vault

  erskine shook his head doubtfully
 it is difficult for me to know where to
begin he said  moreover i cant quite
see how my knowledge of railroading is
going to help me

   if the bonds were taken by stanwood
you will have to work among certain of
his fellow conspirators who are employed
in various departments of this company
the general manager explained  that
a conspiracy against me does exist there
can be no doubt if the thief was my
own son you probably will have to pursue
another line of inquiry and it is in con-
nection with this that i will now tell you
of the second phase of the affair of which
the detectives are ignorant

    then it will be- necessary for me to
work also on the theory that the bonds
were taken by your son  erskine asked

   certainly if you think that by work-

ing out such a theory you can recover the
bonds warrington replied somewhat
petulantly if you deem it expedient to
take this view it may be well for you to
know that i have some reason to believe
that a certain boon companion of my
sorcs has become aware of the fact that
the bonds have disappeared and that my
son is suspected this fellow is charles
montresor an impecunious englishman
who is a nephew and the heir of lord
mordale with whom he lias quarreled

   montresor sometimes visits my daugh-
ter louise and it was to louise that the
other evening he casually mentioned that
joe would do well to get out of the city
for a while louise asked me what it
meant i did not tell her since then all
my efforts to find montresor have been
vain though i am assured that louise
and her mother-neither of whom respects
my authority-see the man from time to
time it is through louise that you may
meet montresor

   but i-i- the young man stam-
mered

   you shall take her to the opera to-
night said warrington  i will intro-
duce you to her if you call at my house
to-night sharply at seven meantime i
will give you this

  the genera manager took from his
pocket a wallet from which he drew sev-
eral bank-notes of large denominations

   here are three thousand dollars he
said  in the course of your quest you
may spend money as freely as you like
when you require more communicate with
me at once signing the name  belleville
to your letters or telegrams but in your
communications to me be careful to make
no reference of whatever nature to the
progress you are maybe making in your
work i have told you that after to-night
i shall have no suggestions of any sort to
offer you

  with shaking fingers the young man
thrust the envelope into the inner pocket
of his coat the general manager smiled
grimly

   i am to infer then that you will un-
dertake the task  he said

  erskine looked irresolutely out of the
window and warrington leaving the
desk at which he had been seated held
out his right hand the young man
grasped it


the railroad mans magazine

   in view of all that you have said i
dont quite see how i can decline it he
answered moodily

   to-night at seven then said the
general manager

   to-night-at seven the young man
muttered

  then with bowed head and unsteady
steps he left the room the rays of a
warm june sun were shining on the city
pavements when erskine again found
himself  the street but he felt as if
the darkness of a stormy moonless night
was closing in around him

   if i should fail  he mused

chapter iv
a red signal flashes

yyhen the young man reached his
 hotel he was dominated by a feel-
ing of anger and resentment why had
warrington -committed such a task to
him he had sought no such employ-
ment as this and in his education and
training there had been nothing to fit him
for such an undertaking in a perfectly
straightforward manner he had applied
for a post in the service of the c s l
and w railroad and he had received a
commission as a spy once he put on his
hat and turned to the door resolved to
refuse the task but he thought bettsr
of it and turned back

  at length however he came to view
the situation in a different light and all
feelings of resentment left him he re-
membered that without warringtons aid
his father scarcely would have been able
to have given to him the education with
which he was now equipped and war-
ringtons present situation was desperate
surrounded by foes and deceived by his
own son the general manager knew not
whom he could trust

  for more than two hours the young
man reviewed the situation carefully at
the end of that time he inclined to the
belief that andrew warrington had mis-
judged his son and that the bonds were
taken by one of the conspirators who were
working in the interest of president bur-
bridge

  erskine was young and vigorous and
despite the mental strain to which he was
subjected by the terrible responsibility

 that had been forced upon him he ate
  hearty luncheon and in the afternoon
 he took a long stroll in lincoln park
 shortly before six oclock he donned his
 dress suit and went down to the hotl
 restaurant for dinner then he went to
 the warrington home on lake shore
 drive he was conducted to the library
 where he found the general manager
 awaiting him

    it was a warm evening but warrington
 was seated in a chair which he had drawn
 in front of the empty fireplace as ers-
 kine entered the general manager turned
 his head but did not rise

   just seven-to the minute eh he
sighed  well boy how have you been
--spending the day 

    in my room and strolling in the
 park the young man replied

   warrington nodded and leaning back
 in his chair he pressed his hands to his
 eyes

    mrs warrington and my daughter
 are still at the dinner - table he said
  when they leave it my daughter will
 meet us here

    is miss warrington willing that i
 should accompany her to the opera 
 erskine asked

    i have not spoken to her yet upon
 the subject the general manager ex-
 plained  you will be her escort how-
 ever though i told you that neither my
 daughter ror her mother respects my
 authority so far as their friendship for
 montresor is concerned i am in all
 other matters master in my own house
 i have said that louise would accompany
 you to the opera to-night she will go
 erskine quailed slightly as he heard
 the grimly spoken words of his host for
 it was apparent that for some reason
 or other the young woman was to be
 compelled to go to the opera against
 her will under the circumstances it
 was more than probable that from the
 first he would inspire her with feelings
 of dislike and distrust and yet her father
 had told him it would be through her
 that he would meet montresor the man
 who had so much influence over her aiid
 yet who was scrupulously keeping out of
 the way of warrington

    the general manager seemed to be read-
 ing the thoughts of his guest for after a
 short pause he said
without lights



   fred youve got to get close to mon-
tresor-and his friends whether the
bonds were taken by my son or by stan-
wood one thing is clear to me  montresor
knows where they are and holds the key
to the situation

  just how he figures in the matter
i do not know this is one of the things
that you must learn and in order to learn
it you may have to play the role of a
blackguard for a while go as far as you
like in your abuse of me

   you have applied for a position in
the service of the c s l and w and i
have turned you down this is your cue
you are disappointed and vindictive get
into the conspiracy against me if you can
the bigger rogue you may seem to be the
better will be your chance begin with
my daughter in her interest and mine
win her confidence and when necessary
betray that confidence in order to save
her from herself

   my flesh and blood seem to be in
league against me why it is i do not
know but for the present we must re-
gard my son and daughter as our enemies
-enemies to be taken off their guard
whenever it is possible to do so is all
this clear to you now 

  as erskine nodded gravely his lips
were compressed and every trace of color
had left his face had he permitted his
lips to open they would have given ex-
pression to his thought

   it is no mans game-this if one
must fight a woman 

  if you see montresor to-night it is
well that you should be able to recognize
him warrington went on  in order
that you may do this i will give you one
of his photographs

  as the general manager spoke he rose
and crossed the floor to a little cabinet
that stood at one end of the room open-
ing one of the drawers he took out a
photograph which he handed to erskine

  as erskine looked curiously at the pic-
ture he saw the portrait of a young man
about thirty years of age with a grave
handsome and resolute face and slightly
curling hair the mouth was shaded by
a heavy dark mustache and the broad
shoulders seemed to be indicative of ex-
traordinary physical strength

   put it into your pocket directed
warrington in low sharp accents

  scarcely had erskine done this however
when he was startled by the quiet clear
voice of a woman

    you wish to see me father  it asked

   yes louise come in warrington
replied

  erskine who had risen was now ga-
zing at a young woman who stood in the
doorway that communicated with the
hall and as he looked a feeling of unrest
that was akin to fear stole over him

  the newcomer appeared to be about
twenty-two years of age and rather above
the average height of women her fea-
tures were admirably molded but though
the dark eyes were filled with light and
her cheeks were suffused with color there
was something in her presence that was
suggestive of coldness despite the girl-
ish grace which invested her her figure
was that of a splendidly developed
woman

  the evening gown she wore left bare
her white arms and shoulders and clung
to her in a manner that revealed the lines
of her beautiful form

  her glossy luxuriant hair was black
and from its coils came the gleam of
precious stones

  as the young woman slowly advanced
into the room she turned her face toward
erskine for a moment the young man
regarded her with admiring eyes then
as he remembered the part he was to play
his gaze fell and a pallor overspread his
face

   louise i want you to meet mr ers-
kine the son of an old friend whom i
have- not seen for many years-said war-
rington  fred this is mv daughter
louise

  as erskine bowed without speaking
the young woman smiled slightly and in-
clined her head a moment later she
turned to her father

  have you ordered the carriage
she asked

   yes warrington replied  unfor-
tunately however i shall be unable to
accompany you to the opera to-night i
have asked mr erskine to take my place
and he has expressed his willingness to
do so

  starting slightly louise turned to
erskine the smile faded suddenly from
her lips and as she looked inquiringly
at the young man whom she now met for


the railroad mans magazine

the first time she paled a little and her
eyes wore a strange searching expression

    mr erskine is very kind the young
woman said coldly

   the curtain rises at eight so i have
ordered the carriage to be at the door
at half-past seven warrington said

  louise turned again to erskine  i
will be in the drawing-room at half-
past seven she said perfunctorily

  then she crossed to the door and left
the room warrington with quizzical
eyes watched his daughter until she dis-
appeared in the hall then with a slight
smile he turned to erskine

   my pretty kitten thinks she has found
a mouse he said with a dry chuckle
 now have a care my boy and keep
your eyes open for montresor some-
thing tells me that he will cross your
trail to-night meet him if you can and
win his confidence and hers

   remember that the key to the mys-
tery of the affair may be in this mans
hands and until you find that key you
will be unable to find the missing bonds
that miserable scoundrel has cast some
sort of a spell over the members of my
family whether he is working in the
interest of burbridge or in his own i
cannot tell but get the bonds lad-get
the bonds in gds name get the
bonds

  the voice of warrington broke and
sinking into his chair he hid his face in
his hands

   ill do my best sir erskine an-
swered wearily

  for several minutes the two men sat
in silence then warrington rose deliber-
ately and walking over to erskine he
laid a hand on his shoulder

   until you succeed in your quest we
must not meet again he said  after
to-night you must not visit either my house
or my office if my daughter is willing
to see you again you must meet her at
those houses which she is in the habit
of visiting i have told you that so
far as this case is concerned you must
work as a man in the dark you must
do more you must run your train with-
out lights and never allow any man or
woman to suspect that you are a friend of
mine

as erskine rose warrington grasped
his hand  the drawing-room is across

the hall he went on  go there now
and wait for louise when you return
from the opera make no attempt to see
me good-night

  they shook hands then with a heavy
heart and hesitating steps erskine made
his way to the drawing-room there
seating himself he fell prey to a series of
gloomy reflections

  how little warrington had told him
after all what was the reason for this
extraordinary lack of confidence between
this strange man and his children what
was at the bottom of the mysterious game
which this man montresor seemed to be
playing how was he to meet and win
the confidence of the englishman and
having won that confidence how was he
to recover the bonds

   i am ready mr erskine

  the young man started violently as
these words fell upon his ears and a
moment later he was looking into the
lustrous eyes of louise warrington who
stood a few paces from him and was in
the act of drawing on her gloves

   ah pardon me miss warrington
erskine stammered as he rose hastily
 i did not hear you enter and-

   the carriage is at the door i be-
lieve louise interrupted coldly as she
raised her opera cloak to her shoulders

  like a man in a dream erskine ac-
companied the beautiful young woman
to the street and helped her into the
waiting carriage as he turned to the
coachman louise said quietly

   the man has his instructions
erskine entered the carriage closed the
door and the carriage moved away for
several minutes tlje occupants of the
vehicle sat in silence erskine was the
first to speak with a little laugh he
said

   i am afraid miss warrington that
you will find me a badly informed escort
to-night for i do not even know the name
of the opera to which your father had
planned to take you

    it is  faust 

   then we are going to the audito-
rium of course

   no the young woman answered
coldly

   but i thought it was only at the
auditorium that grand opera is present-
ed in chicago
without lights



   true it is at the auditorium that
 faust  is to be presented to-night but
we are not going there

 erskine started the interior of the
 carriage was so dark that he was unable
to see the face of his companion but
into his minds eye there came a flash of
ruby light-the flash of a danger signal
swung by the hand of fate

   and why  he asked in a voice that
was almost as cold as hers had been

   because i have an appointment

   indeed  he murmured

  as he spoke he became aware of the
fact that the cab was turning sharply
to the right

  where are we going now

  the young woman did not answer and
for several minutes the silence was un-
broken the carriage shortly afterward
made another turn and erskine became
aware that it was headed for the dark
shades of lincoln park

  the young mans feeling of amazement
had given place to anger for a time and
now anger was succeeded by curiosity
what sort of an appointment might this
singular young woman be expected to
have at this hour in the park

  it was clear that miss warrington
had been right when she said that the
driver had received his instructions for he
drove in the manner of one who had
traversed this route before and was per-
fectly at home among the dark wind-
ing roadways of the great city play-
ground

  the stars were shining but there was
 moon erskine however made out
the dark outlines of the grant monument
shortly before the carriage drew up be-
side a clump of trees

   now leave me please louise said
shortly when the carriage stopped

   not here erskine replied in a tone
of decision  unwilling as i am to in-
trude upon you i must decline to leave
you until i see you to the door of your
fathers house

   i fear that i cannot longer look for

protection in my fathers house louise
retorted bitterly  when it was from that
house that my father sent me with a mis-
erable hireling spy

    a spy  erskine faltered

   yes and now that you know that i
have found you out will you be good
enough to leave this carriage 

no the young man muttered

    then i will be compelled to do so
and as she spoke louise warrington
rose thrust open the door and stepped
out erskine followed her

  scarcely had the young mans feet
touched the ground when he saw a dark
figure advancing toward him from among
the trees it was the figure of a man

   mr erskine the newcomer called

    well  erskine asked

    a word with you if you please

   erskine leaning forward tried to see
the features of the man who had accost-
ed him but he was unable to do so after
a moments hesitation he moved slowly
in the direction of the stranger who
was advancing to meet him as each
halted about five feet away from the
other the stranger spoke

    i am sorry to have to ask you to give
me the photograph which mr warring-
ton gave to you a few minutes ago he
said and erskine saw that the speaker
was himself the original of the photo-
graph-montresor

  erskine was about to speak when the
movement of carriage wheels behind him
caused him to turn his head louise
warrington had disappeared and the car-
riage that had brought her to the spot
was now moving rapidly away

  the astonished young man was on the
point of yielding to an impulse to fol-
low the departing vehicle when a heavy
blow landing behind his left ear sent
him staggering toward the clump of trees
from which montresor had emerged he
did not fall however and he was in
the act of starting toward his assailant
when a blow from behind felled him to
the ground and he lost consciousness

oxe of the busiest bureaus of a railroad system is the bureau of informa-
tion and the men who operate them must know a great deal more than
the answer to that oft-repeated query  what time does the ten
oclock train leave-

    tliej- must be able to direct a passenger from a given point to some speck
on the map where railroads appear to be unknown quantities they must be
well up in rates and they must know every point that their line touches and
the principal connecting points with other lines they are the human time-
tables and guide-books-for they are always correct

some of the queer queries hurled at the patient individual who is
supposed to reply to questions relating to railway
transit and nothing else

y he least spoken of and the
most spoken to department
of a railroad is its bureau of
information but it is a
busy place nevertheless it
opens up for business early
in the morning and keeps open until late
at night and it takes a pretty level-
headed man to deal out the information

   oh yes says the head of one of the
railroad information departments in new
york  they do ask pertinent questions
about trains but it is a perfectly fair and
honest statement vhen i say that the odd
fantastic and downright foolish questions
that are put to us in the course of a day
exceed the sane questions by a ratio of
almost three to one


information



    some days it is less than other clays
and when we are running excursions a
whole lot more

  the chief clerk of the bureau of infor-
mation of the new york central lines-
a bureau on which the company spends
many thousands of dollars a year-is ed-
ward j bradley known in railroad  in-
formation circles  as the premier rapid-
fire question answerer

  he has been serving in his present
capacity in the information-booth in the
grand central station for more than eight

years ancl during that time has come into
contact with hundreds of inquirers of all
kinds he is aided by albert jackson
whose ability to speak ten different lan-
guages is frequently useful

  a layman says mr bradley  would
hardly believe me when i say that we have
to answer-or rather are supposed to an-
swer- hundreds of the most outlandish
questions there are about a dozen per-
sons constantly at the windows on the
hunt for information and some days this
number runs as high as fifty

    in addition to this when it is remem-
bered that the number of telephone in-

quiries we answered from january  to
june   for instance was exactly
 you can get a fair idea of the tre-
mendous number of information - seekers
whom we have to accommodate

  if you think the old one asking at
what time the two oclock train leaves is
a poser continued mr bradley  listen
to some of these

   an elderly lady hurried up to the win-
dow and wanted to know if the ferry at
garrison - on - the - hudson landed at the
foot of the hill

   another lady very much younger
said she intended to leave for boston
by boat three nights later and wanted
to know whether the weather indica-
tions were good for that night ques-
tions as to weather are put to us every
day the one about moonlightnights
being the most frequent	

    do they check dogs in the parcel-
room   is another favorite as is also
the inquiry as to whether or not the
engine-bell rings loud enough to dis-
turb the slumbers of the passengers in
the sleeping-cars

   stand around for a while and
you will certainly hear one or the
other on the day i have in mind
a man rushed up to the window told
me he was going to chicago on the
wednesday following-two days later
-and asked me whether he would
surely be able to make connections
with a certain train for the west the
connecting time was twenty minutes
and i told him i thought he would be
able to  think wont do   he roared
at me  i must know positively 
and when i told him i could not tell
him positively he departed in a furor
and said he would report me for incom-
petency

   speaking of similar threats on that
very same day i was actually reported to
my superiors by a woman who wanted to
know whether there was a special service
at grace church that afternoon when
i answered that  did not know she ex-
claimed   i am a regular commuter on
this railroad and its information bureau
ought to be able to give me the informa-
tion about the city that i want

   the case of this woman is not so very
much different from that of a lot of other
persons-you would be surprised at the


the railroad mans magazine

number-who believe that the informa-
tion bureau is for information on any and
all topics

   men come up to the window ask me
for information on prize-fights or baseball
percentages and try to get me to decide
bets for them a man once asked me to
decide a bet as to the significance of the
name of the planet mars while another
wanted to know for a similar purpose
how many ties there were on the tracks be-
tween scarborough and fishkill the
parties had agreed on me as the arbiter

    in addition to inquirers such as these
every hour or so some one will come to
our booth and get very angry when we
refuse to sell him stamps one woman
who approached the window begged and
begged me to sell her a stamp because as
she said she had to mail an important
letter-on the next train

   when i told her that we did not have
any stamps to sell and could not sell them
if we did have them she left in a huff
she furthermore refused to go across the
station where i directed her to get the
stamps saying as she swished away that
she would henceforth always patronize a
railroad that did sell stamps

   once a man wanted to punch me be-
cause i would not stop to tell him in full
just how the station was heated  told
him that the heating - pipes were placed
under the benches and after he hadtailed
to locate them in their concealed position
he came back and told me i had better not
try to joke with him or hed knock my
head off another man wanted to know
how the big station clock was worked
and still another why there were not
more clocks around

    if a train is late fully a score of peo-
ple will rush up to the booth and want to
know if it will make up time and how
much every day a number of prospec-
tive travelers inquire as to whether chil-
dren can play their games in the pullman
smoking-rooms others are eager to learn
the best play to go to see when they have
arrived at their destination and there are
some who ak for a book to read

   one out of every hundred- wants to
know why it is that i cannot take care of
his parcels for him instead of sending him
to the checking-room every little while
somebody who has just arrived from out
of town asks me to call a cab for him

   one woman asked me if i would ar-
range to have a cab meet her when she
arrived in buffalo i told her that she
would have no difficulty in getting a con-
veyance  but she insisted that it might be
raining and that she did not care to take
any chances when i finally convinced
her that i could not do as she wished she
said she thought i might be obliging and
telegraph

   another woman asked me to tell her
how far it was from the union station
in cleveland to a certain house she wished
to get to in another part of that city i
estimated the distance but she was dissat-
isfied because i was not able to tell her the
exact number of blocks

  there are many seekers after informa-
tion who resort to the mails and the ques-
tions they propound are no less wonderful
than those asked at the station p v d
lockwood of the new york central lines
regularly receives these communications
each of these letters no matter how diffi-
cult the query is answered

  one writer recently asked mr lock-
wood if the railroad company could help
him locate a long-lost relative who had
been a regular patron of the road while
another inquired if he might be allowed
to buy a seat in the pullman for his dog

  a woman wrote not long ago asking
that a porter be sent with her to garden
city she said that she did not know
whether the line was a direct one or not
but if the company sent a porter along
with her to look after her luggage it
would not matter otherwise she would
travel over another road whenever she
had occasion to

  a letter received from a man asked if
the seats in the day-coaches were suffi-
ciently wide apart to allow him to stretch
his legs if his suit-case were placed in
front of him another was anxious for
information as to whether he would be
allowed to practise singing in the pullman
smoking-room during the run to chicago
he stated that he did not wish to lose a
day in his effort to cultivate his voice

  a woman wrote recently and asked
what class of people would be traveling
on a certain train to the west ina week

  another wanted to know if she would
be allowed to carry a portable bath-tub
with her and have it set up in the pullman
dressing-room
the pennsylvanias conquest
of new york

by arno dosch

when we published our first article on the pennsylvania railroad com-
panys new passenger station in new york city over three years
agothe building existed only in architects drawings and blue-prints
now the station stands in beautiful and classic outline like the embodiment
of a dream whose fulfilment has been long awaited and yet for a work of
such a stupendous nature the accomplishment has been miraculously quick
if you would realize what a stupendous task it has been and still is you can
get an idea of it from the following article

how a railroad bought twenty-eight acres of new york city bored
ten miles of tunnels and is spending  just
to run its tracks into the metropolis

assatts dream has come
true new york city is
now an asset of the penn-
sylvania railroad straight
across the most thickly pop-
ulated and most valuable
island in the world the pennsylvania has
shoved its underground tubes and in the
very middle has planted its gigantic sta-
tion capable of handling half a million
people a day

  cassatt who made the sign of the key-
stone stand for perfection in railroading
was president of the pennsylvania and
dreamed for it wonderful almost impos-
sible things he sat over in his office in
philadelphia and watched the new york
central with its great station and many
lines carry off the cream of the new
york traffic because it was easy to reach

  he saw his own lines stopped at jersey

city with the hudson river between and
nothing with which to win traffic from
manhattan island except ferry-boats
slow and uncertain devices starting from
the ends of narrow streets down which
the passengers crowded dodging the
heavy trucks of the water-front his
road was enormously handicapped no
matter what it cost he saw that he must
remove the disadvantage

a dead mans dream

  so he dreamed of eliminating the bar-
rier and making of manhattan island a
part of the mainland by sending his trains
bowling under the river into the very
heart of the city nor was that all of
the dream

  pie could see how convenient and
profitable it would be to make a great




the railroad mans magazine

seaport at montauk point the farther end
of long island dependent upon his rail-
road with no other line touching the
new port the pennsylvania could fetch
and carry for whole fleets of steamers
and keep its tracks busy with freiglit-
trains bringing the produce of the south
and west

  as to the seaport he did not look for
it immediately but he secured control of
the long island railroad which owned
the land at montauk point and he
planned four more tubes under the east
river then he set about writing an epic
in steel and stone and made possible the
greatest single project ever undertaken
by a railroad unfortunately he did not
live to see it finished but he died con-
scious that he had rounded out a full life
with a marvelous climax of achievement

comparison with panama

  it has been a surprisingly expensive
undertaking for lack of anything else
to compare it with it must rank with the
panama canal the opening of which is
expected to mark an epoch in the progress
of the world

  the canal is now more than half fin-
ished and has cost  while
the pennsylvania extension into new
york which is now about ready for use
shows on the auditors books paid bills to
the extent of  the full
force of these figures can only be realized
when it is remembered how long the na-
tion hesitated before it decided to spend
 to bring about a lasting
benefit to the whole world

  one - third of that amount was paid
out by a single corporation to secure a
few miles of track into a city

  one hundred million dollars it is
difficult to conceive such a sum baldly
stated  but if some one had stood on the
bank of the hudson with its discoverer
three hundred years ago and had thrown
a dollar into the river every minute since
that time he would still have several
decades to go before he had got rid of
such a pile of money it took the penn-
sylvania seven years

  put expensive as it was its builders
knew before they started that they would
get back all and more with it there lay
new york the most fruitful field for

transportation companies in the country
but only tapped directly by one railroad
they saw that by cutting into the up-town
district which was having the greatest
growth the pennsylvania could command
a big share of this traffic

a safe venture

  it was no experiment the railroad
was taking no chances it could not lose
every new form of locomotion which had
ever been tried in new york from horse-
cars to the subway had always found all
the patronage it could handle every ten
years the number of passengers doubled

  before taking final action however an
investigation of the density of new yorks
population was made and it was found
to be eight times as great as any other
american city and more than three times
as great as london this indicated that
future growth must be outward making
suburban traffic and that the pennsyl-
vania was counting on

  with the various census figures to go
on the pennsylvania directors forecasted
a population of  in  and
considerably over  in  it
was merely a question where these new
millions would sleep they would prac-
tically all have to seek the suburbs what
suburb they chose and by what lines they
traveled concerned the pennsylvania

  the question of freight was-also con-
sidered most of it now comes to new
york on ferry-boats and lighters the
amount which crosses water in this man-
ner is alone  tons a year
and of this the pennsylvania handles -
 bringing this directly into the
city and across to long island would
mean a saving which would in itself pay
interest on the 

realizing the dream

  cassatts dream had taken form by
  now it is realized it consists of
two single-track iron tube tunnels under
the hudson and four under the east
river forming almost a straight line
from new jersey to long island the con-
necting tubes on manhattan island trav-
ersing thirty-second and thirty-third
streets from end to end in the very cen-
ter of new york the pennsylvania depot
the pennsylvanias conquest of new york 

stands on twenty-eight acres of land the
biggest railroad station in the world

  the whole new system commences at
harrison new jersey just east of new-
ark where a large transfer station has
been built from that point a new double
track on an elevated roadway makes a
straight line across the plackensack mead-
ows and directly through bergen hill
which forms the southern end of the pali-
sades

  immediately beyond bergen hill is the
hudson where the tunnels without rising
to the surface plunge into tubes lying
seventy feet below the bottom of the river
coming up on manhattan island the
tracks multiply from two to twenty-one
for the terminal

reaching long island

  the station itself faces seventh avenue
between thirty-first and thirty-third
streets and the tracks to long island
pass out eastward under it in two twin
tunnels extending from seventh avenue
under thirty-second and thirty-third
streets to the east river gradually drop-
ping to a lower grade until they enter the
four single-track tubes at the east river
beyond first avenue going under the
river the tubes come to the surface at the
entrance to the big yard at sunnyside on
long island where connection is made
with the long island railroad

  the task of building this long subaque-
ous passageway was gigantic and could
not have been accomplished except in a
day when methods worthy of giants are
used but even with all the experience
which the engineers had had in tunneling
under rivers obstacles were constantly en-
countered which required immediate so-
lution

  the work was planned more than ten
years ago but the cost was so great that
the pennsylvania hardly considered it safe
to sink such a large sum at one timp into
an enterprise which could not be mde to
pay until it was completed there was
a movement afoot to have all the railroads
entering jersey city combine in building
tunnels under the hudson but the others
did not respond and the pennsylvania
finally decided to do it alone

  after it had all been planned two com-
panies were formed to secure the neces-

sary privileges the first of these the
pennsylvania new jersey and new york
railroad company was incorporated
february   and was empowered
to build to the new jersey line which is
half-way under the hudson

  the pennsylvania new york and long
island railroad incorporated april 
of the same year was to take up the work
at that point and carry it the rest of the
way under the river across manhattan
island and under the east river these
companies were a mere formality and the
whole task was handled by a special board
of engineers headed by c m jacobs

  the great engineering problem solved
and the spectacular feat performed by
these men was the building of the mile-
long tunnels under the hudson river
the excavations within the city while on
an enormous scale do not grip the im-
agination like the slender threads of steel
and concrete working their way foot by
foot through the soft mud until they met
within half an inch of where they expect-
ed to be

  at the time these tunnels were com-
menced in  there were no others
completed across the hudson and a long
line of unsuccessful attempts since 
made the undertaking appear doubtful
in less capable hands it might have been
but in fact it proceeded without a hitch
unexpected difficulties cropped up from
day to day but each was met and disposed
of as soon as it showed itself

an all-important choice

  there was a choice of three methods
all of which had been tried in other cities
notably london these were building
the tubes in sections and sinking them in
coffer-dams by the use of caissons or by
pushing the tubes forward from the inside
behind shields the most successful for
long stretches of tunneling under water
had been found to be the shield method
so that was adopted

  the principle behind it is the same as
that of shoving two fingers horizontally
through mud until they touch the tun-
nels start out from both shores and meet
in the middle they make their way by
pressing shields the size of the tunnel
against the soft silt of the river-bottom
and forcing it out of the way or when


the railroad mans magazine

necessary taking some of it into the tun-
nel through the traps in the shields and
carting it oft through the portion of the
tunnel already completed

care of the crew

  as the shield moves forward propelled
by hydraulic pressure iron rings the size
of the tube and from eighteen to thirty
inches wide are fastened one to another
in a string forming the body of the tun-
nels the shield progresses continually
beyond the last of these into the mud
preparing space for another always leav-
ing a space between the face of the shield
and the last of the rings liable to cave in

  this is prevented by compressed air
which offers sufficient resistance to hold
even soft mud in place the use of com-
pressed air makes the work very incon-
venient on account of the constant atten-
tion to air-locks but the danger from it to
the workmen is not great when there is
proper medical attendance rules for the
use of air and provisions for the safety
of the men were laid down by the railroad
in every contract and as the builders lived
up to them there were no deaths from the
 bends which attacks men remaining
for long watches under compressed air

  the work began with the sinking of
two shafts one on the manhattan and
one on the new jersey shore to provide
starting - places for the tubes the
manhattan shaft was excavated without
trouble but the one on the other side en-
countered difficulties which did not augur
well for the whole enterprise

breaking ground

  it was started in the fall of  and
during the winter was flooded by high
tides bursting water-mains and heavy
rains the rock was of poor quality con-
stantly collapsing and the sides caved in
if not timbered immediately but by
the expenditure of an unexpected amount
of money the shaft was in shape for work
in the spring and danger from water was
eliminated by the introduction of an elab-
orate system of drainage

  the next step was to start the tunnels
toward the river-bed far enough to admit
of the shields being erected and the com-
pressed-air being turned on as the

shields were erected a considerable dis-
tance from the river they were forced at
first through rock gravel rip-rap and
even the stone sea-wall men working
ahead of the shield clearing the space

   during this first stage of the progress
the nine trap-doors in the specially con-
structed shields were constantly open for
the passage of the men and the dirt and
rock they removed but as soon as they
reached the line of the shore it was
planned to close the doors tight and force
the shields steadily ahead pushing the
semifluid mud out of the way

   in theory this worked out splendidly
all that was necessary was to use suffi-
cient hydraulic pressure to lift the bottom
of the river slightly and give passageway
for the tubes underneath just as a finger
presses its unerring way untif it reaches
the tip of the other finger

the crawling monster

  but when it came to putting it into
practise it was found that the tube would
not go in a straight line as it should
there was no question about the power to
push it ahead the shield moved into the
mud irresistibly but it showed a constant
tendency to rise to so marked a degree
that it would not have been long before
the tunnels came up in the bottom of the
river the more it rose the greater the
tendency to rise

  the surveying crew was constantly on
hand however to detect the slightest de-
viation from the line every time a new
ring was set in place they took its position
down to the thousandth of an inch and
that is no easy task in the foggy atmos-
phere of compressed-air

   they discovered this tendency immedi-
ately and avay was found to prevent it
one of the lower doors in the shield was
opened and a certain amount of the pres-
sure from below was removed by the silt
which was taken in through it

   this became so important a part of the
work that the tubes lying side by side and
forging ahead in the same direction were
worked one at a tune the idle one being
used to carry off the refuse when this
was being done the shield of one would
be driven until it had passed the other a
short distance and then the other resumed
its activity
the pennsylvanias conquestof new york 

  this had a peculiar effect as one
passed the other it drew away and rose
above the other and it was all the engi-
neers could do to keep them in line at
such times

contortions of the tubes

  before the tubes reached the river mud
the iron rings had a tendency to flatten
making them broader than they were
high but as soon as they reached the mud
the tendency was exactly the opposite way
out in the middle however they re-
mained round

  when it came time for the tubes to
meet far out under the river the survey-
ings showed such  precise record work 
that it was decided to drive the shields
directly at each other until they touched
in the case of both tunnels the faith was
justified as the tubes had not deviated in
their course as much as half an inch

  the success of the tunneling depended
very largely upon the shields but at the
time this work was commenced none had
been designed which filled the require-
ments to provide one which would an-
swer all purposes devolved upon chief
engineer jacobs and his assistant james
forgie and they made a design which
proved so efficient that it has become a
standard in the main outlines it was
not unusual but in detail it was largely
original

  it fit into the end of the tube like a
cork in a bottle being pushed forward
by rams capable of exerting  pounds
of pressure to the square inch the power
was exerted within the shield itself which
weighed  pounds and was twenty-
three feet or the size of the tunnel in
diameter

what the shield is like

  at the face or most forward portion
of the shield was the  cutting edge
protected from above by a hood while
in rock and gravel the material through
which it was passing was attacked from
eight sliding platforms operated by hy-
draulic pressure separate from that which
moved the shield forward

  just below the platforms was a bird
fountain or water trap cut to catch
the muck if it came too quickly the

doors in the shield to permit of the pass-
age of material and men had to be so
constructed as not to hinder the work and
yet to close promptly and make the shield
 choke itself  if the men lost control
of the material which they were working
against

  as the material was removed the iron
rings were placed these came in seg-
ments and were merely bolted together
the segments making air-tight connec-
tions on the inside they were later
strengthened by a two-foot coat of con-
crete

  the provisions for the maintenance of
the compressed-air section at the shield
involved two bulkheads each ten feet
thick with heavy doors to permit passage
one of these was placed immediately be-
hind the shield and the other  feet
distant

differences of conditions

  while in the course of construction
through the rock or gravel the tubes were
well sustained but as soon as they pushed
their way into the mud there was an im-
mediate difference bringing an addition-
al strain on the tubes at the points where
the change was made this condition was
even more pronounced where the tubes
passed through the sea-wall with mud
on both sides to meet this extra strain
steel tubes were placed at these points of
danger

  the manhattan cross - town tunnels
which start from the station on seventh
avenue and end on long island en-
countered difficulties which are not of so
great importance in ordinary tunneling
the two used for west-bound traffic lie
under thirty-third street and the two
for east-bound traffic under thirty-sec-
ond and on their entire length are flanked
by many buildings some of them twenty
stories and more high

  in building them blasting powder had
to be used with great caution and where
the ground was soft the timbering neces-
sary to prevent cave-ins presented even
a more perplexing problem special de-
vices were invented on the spot to meet
contingencies as they arose and deep-sunk
building foundations were often given a
subfoundation without affecting the heavy
pile of steel and stone above


the railroad mans magazine

   in fact the tunnels did not make as
much outward impression on the life of
the city as the excavation of a founda-
tion for an ordinary building there
were occasional shafts sunk but most of
the material was removed through the
ends of the tunnels and dumped on scows
at both ends

even new york noticed

  as the tunnels approach the east
river they connect with the four tubes
crossing to long island the construc-
tion of these was not unlike those under
the hudson except that they were only
half as long

   of all this work thecity saw nothing
 at all but when it came to building the
 sunken terminal the magnitude of the
 undertaking was too obvious to escape at-
 tention even in new york where things
 are done on a huge scale and there is
 no limit to the audacity of enterprise
 the pennsylvanias operations outstripped
 anything that had ever been done

   without consideration for the value of
 the property it was decided that twenty-
 eight acres were needed for the handling
 of passengers and trains and this in a
 city eight times as densely populated as
 any other american city it meant the
 purchase and demolishing of four very
 large city blocks which had been built
 solid for years four hundred five to
 ten story structures crowded the space
 but to the railroad they represented only
 so much brick and stone which must be
 got rid of with the greatest possible speed

   treating the mass of buildings as if
they were hills which had to be cut away
shaft heads were driven straight through
them and great chunks were bitten out of
the houses cars operated by electric
cranes were always handy to dump the
chunks into and from that time the ma-
terial was not touched until it was placed
on scows

chunks of manhattan

   when the buildings were all gone the
 solid rock was excavated over the whole
 area to a depth varying from forty-five
 feet on the east end to sixty feet on the
 west end it made a hole in the ground
 bigger than anything of the kind new

york had ever seen to lay the founda-
tion for the reception of the tracks and
the station cost alone 

  the building proper which covers half
of it has cost over  as
much of it is below as above ground and
the proportions of it are so nicely bal-
anced that it does not seem overlarge
thirty-second and thirtythird streets
west of seventh avenue were vacated to
give it room

  it has a frontage of  feet with side
walls  feet long the tracks are
forty feet below the surface of the street
permitting of three levels between the
entrances and the trains

  the structure was built with one end
in view- that of handling the crowds the
railroad looks for a business which would
make even that capacious station crowded
if it had not been so arranged that the
incoming and outgoing throngs are kept
away from each other

worlds largest station

  the main entrance is on seventh av-
enue and extends across half the width of
the building but all the front entrances
lead immediately into an arcade forty-
five feet wide to give room for the com-
muters hurrying in and out during the
rush hours but the commuter who al-
lows himself only half a minute to catch
his train will have to wait for the next
as he has a thousand feet and two flights
of stairs ahead of him

  a special subway runs from the bag-
gage - room on the second level to the
tracks below and up and down this the
baggage will be hauled by power trucks
the old familiar scene of baggagemen
hauling high piles of trunks along the
platforms will be done away with and
they will be sent speeding to the baggage-
cars before the passengers are permitted
on the platform

  big elevators for the handling of
trunks have also been built and in spite
of the enormous size of the room and the
number of trunks the organization of
the baggage-room is so arranged that a
traveler can rush in with his trunk in
a taxicab with him and have it checked
on the same train even if he has only a
few minutes to spare

with the mammoth waiting and bag-
the pennsylvanias conquest of new york 

gage rooms on this level it hardly seems
as if there would be room for anything
else yet the taxicab station is at the back
and in front lies the concourse over
 feet wide and  feet long it
joins the waiting-room to the west af-
fording an easy passage to the stairs
which descend to the train platforms be-
low the concourse is also in the nature
of a broad gallery overlooking the tracks
and is roofed far above by a train-shed
of iron and glass

  in spite of the bewildering size how-
ever it will be easy to keep straight at
the head of each flight of stairs will be
signs such as are used in any railroad
station indicating the destination and
leaving time of the next train to depart
from the platform below gatemen will
of course be stationed at the head of
each flight to examine tickets

  to facilitate traffic and save time both
for trains and passengers the tracks
have been apportioned and commuters
can always tell just where they will find
their trains trains coming from the
west of the hudson will enter on the
south and leave at the center platforms
trains made up in the yards at long
island for philadelphia and the south
and west will stop to pick up passengers
on the tracks next and the northern side
will be devoted to long island traffic

  the length of time necessary to empty
and load trains has been figured down
to a nicety and no more will be allowed
for a train than necessary incoming
trains require but a minute or two but
it will take between five and ten min-
utes for out-bound trains except in the
case of some of the suburban traffic which
will fill almost as fast as they empty
main - line trains will have their own
tracks and will be given more leeway

segregated traffic

  with the same end in view special en-
trances and exits are arranged so that
long island commuters will not have
to jostle those bound for new jersey and
main-line passengers will have ample
space to finish the last necessary details
without having theij- way blocked by a
swarm of people hurrying through the
station all the stairways are so built
that they present themselves immediate-

ly before the passenger when he requires
them and even some one who has never
been in the building before can race
through it to catch a train without losing
the way

  the main entrance is not the only one
by any means at every corner and street
crossing which the building touches there
are wide entrances and exits there is
even a passageway under the street from
thirty-fourth street it is calculated
that three-quarters of a million people
could go in and out of the building every
day without crowding or delay

  carriages and motor-cars enter at the
two corners on seventh avenue and- de-
scend by easy inclines to the middle
level where passengers must alight at
the entrance to the waiting-room and
crossing the waiting-room and concourse
descend on foot bv the regular stairs to
the trains

  the exits are separate from the en-
trances and the incoming passengers will
find themselves headed down long gal-
leries which lead under the waiting-room
to special elevators and stairways

looking ten years ahead

  with such facilities for taking on and
disposing of train  loads of passengers
it is expected that the terminal will be
able to handle  trains a day there
is not enough traffic to make it necessary
yet but by  when there is that extra
four million to bring to the city and fetch
home again every night the station will
be taxed to its capacity at least that
was the theory of the board of directors
when they authorized the spending of
 on the new york connec-
tions

  when the whole system was about com-
pleted it was decided also to operate
suburban trains through the mcadoo
tunnels connecting at marion new jer-
sey with the main line of the pennsyl-
vania

  the marvel of the great station and
the thing which will be most commented
upon will be its cleanness no coal-burn-
ing engine will ever enter the station
special electric engines have been made
and they will take all trains as far as
harrison in new jersey and the sunnv-
side yards on long island train equip-

merits will be entirely new all the cars
are built of steel

  it might seem as if new york were
too large to be affected even by the
building of the biggest railroad station
in the heart of it but there will in fact
be a great deal added to the metropolitan
air of the city by its presence

  from the passengers point of view
there is just one possible drawback to
the new system and few will ever care
anything about it new york approached

by the river has had one grand aspect-
the great cluster of buildings seen from
the river

  at night the lower end of the island ap-
pears to be a mountain filled with fire
seen through many caverns and those
who come to new york over lines which
must be content to empty their passengers
into ferry-boats at jersey city can gaze
on this fascinating arabian night spec-
tacle and get what consolation they can
for the extra time it is taking them

why animals are run over

by e a spears

they seem to have a peculiar instinct that they can run faster

 than a train can travel

whex webbs road as it was locally
called now known as the adiron-
dack division of the new york cen-
tral was first built through the woods one
of its wonders was the deer that got on
the tracks and ran in front of the engines

  this happened not only at night-time but
during the day also the animals didnt
know what to make of the mass of steel
and wood thundering down upon them and
after hesitating a moment they would turn
tail and flee before the oncoming train

  it often surprised the enginemc-n how fast
these animals could cover ground fre-
quently they were overtaken and hurled to
one side by the pilot sometimes however
they cbuld jump to one side just as the
pilot was about to strike them not infre-
quently at night the great headlight would
keep a deer standing still in his tracks until
he was struck down

  it seems to be the general rule for most
animals to keep running on the track
straight ahead of the engine a fireman
tells how he was going up the rome wa-
tertown and ogdensburg line new york
during the summer when he noticed a
hound loping in front of the freight

  the train was not proceeding very fast
but it was catching up with the dog as it
came nearer the dog increased speed and
at length ran to his utmost his ears
flopped up and down his tail rose and fell
with every leap as the freight kept creeping
closer every second

  the dog kept to the track notwithstand-

ing the ringing of the bell and the tooting
of the whistle finally the engine was
right upon the dog and the last the fireman
saw of him was his bobbing head just in
front of the train in a few moments more
the dog was killed he had run along for
nearly half a mile and something or other
kept him to the rails

  birds have a like instinct for keeping in
front of a train only they seem to have a
strong desire to cross the track engineer
and firemen have noticed time and again
that when a flock of birds are flushed from
between fences they will follow parallel
with die engine at times almost for a mile
in the endeavor to cross in front of it

  if they succeed in crossing they quit fol-
lowing the train often they swoop up
over it and through the smoke when the
dash in front fails

 when the train is going too fast of
course they get left - 

 in the autumn many birds migrate in
the night and they are then attracted by
bright lights it is likely that some of them
are killed by the headlight for firemen and
engineers tell of finding blood on the heavy
glass

  insects such as moths often plaster the
headlight after an evening run ltndoubt-
edly insects are attracted to the light when
it is a long distance away and thus they
get in the pathway of the train at any
event the great headlights of locomotives
become literally smeared and plastered with
the bodies of the insects which fly at night

        sammie mcclaren did not know just how his
        ride in the lone light engine would end

ammie mcclaren said af-
  terward that he knew it was his
  off day the minute he reached
  the top of the stairs leading to
  the chief despatchers office
  and after he had walked the
  length of the gloomy hall he
  was sure of it

  so when he cautiously pushed open the
door to the chiefs little office he crossed
his fingers tentatively before venturing
into the room the inside of the office
reassured him however it was a narrow
little room with a desk in the center

   behind the desk sat the short fat little
chief despatcher and before the desk was
an empty chair

 the chief did not look up when sam-
mie entered but as sain himself would
say he was used to the bluffs of many
chiefs so he quietly took the vacant chair
and waited at last the chief raised his
head from his desk and looked vaguely at
sam or in his neighborhood sam
squirmed uneasily in his chair and cleared
his throat

   how are you fixed for operators
he asked

  but the chief continued to stare for a
few seconds then he suddenly swung
around in his chair jumped to his feet
and pattered across the floor through a
side door and out of sight into what sam
took to be the trick despatchers room

   hes batty muttered sam to him-
self  this is sure my unlucky day i
think id better put off askin for a job
till to-morrow

  but just then the chief returned with a
message in his hand which he was read-
ing with some intentness so sam re-
mained in his seat

  sam took note of the fact that the fat
little chief chewed tobacco in a manner
that reminded him comically of a goat
and that he spat about him as he walked
as if under some mental stress

   hes dutch  observed sam  and
that means hes a jonah

  at last the chief looked up at sam
with a question in his glinting spectacles

  how are you fixed for operators
sam repeated doggedly

  the chief looked surprised and pleased
which facts sam noted as more signs of
bad luck to follow for he was used to
chiefs that growl and grumble when asked
for a job and this departure from the
usual sam regarded with suspicion

   are you a telegraph operator  asked
the chief  well sir i believe that i
can give you a job if you are let me see
your service letters

  sam produced a goodly sized bundle of
letters and placed them upon the desk be-
fore the chief this showing of so many
service letters was indiscreet in sam for
but few chiefs like to hire an operator who
has moved about too much

   well well murmured the chief
opening his eyes in mild surprise  it
seems you have plenty of them a sort of
boomer eh well let us hope that you
will settle down and give good service
 its my bad luck complained sara
warming in spite of his suspicions  i
work just so long for a road then some-
thing happens and im fired

   of course i knew that it wasnt your
fault smiled the chief  you look like
an industrious conscientious young man
and i believe you intend to do right by
us

   but as the chief read letter after letter


the railroad mans magazine

lie could not help but note that  dis-
charged for sleeping on duty  appeared
in a great many of them

  so after unwinding yards of red tape
preliminary to going to work sam was
sent to a small station as night operator

  but here his bad luck as he character-
ized it still pursued him there was lit-
tle work to do at this night office and he
could not help but sleep on duty

  after bearing patiently with him for
about two weeks the trick despatcher told
the chief things and sam was called back
to the office

  disgust and resignation were written
on sams countenance as he again faced
the chief despatcher in the narrow little
office

   its  go he complained despond-
ently  ive got a hoodoo in me some
place

   the chiefs eyes glinted a little behind
his glasses as he looked up sams under-
sized person but he seemed not greatly
offended

   ill give you one more chance he
said deliberately  and well see if your
hoodoo remains with you

  sams mouth opened loosely never
before in all his experience had a second
trial been given him and this change of
procedure in the species was so startling
that he forgot to be suspicious until it
was too late

   there is a small mining town out on
the desert said the chief  in the oppo-
site direction from where i first sent you
there i have a good night job for you
theres enough work to do there to keep
you awake if youll do it and the pay is
pretty good in fact it is a good job
will you take it 

   sure said sam not considering be-
fore committing himself

    your train will leave here within five
minutes went on the chief  so youll
have to hurry to catch it heres your
pass good-by 

  sam took the pass and departed but
he was hardly started on his journey be-
fore his superstitious fears returned and
began to cause him uneasiness

   gee  he grumbled to himself as the
train left the green fertile country around
division headquarters and began to roll
out on the desert  gee i didnt even
have my fingers crossed when i accepted

  the job somethings sure to happen
wish i hadnt told him yes if i had the
iwo weeks pay thats coming to me id
keep right on going

  after two or three hours of hot riding
sam at last arrived at his station and was
left upon the platform where he gazed
about him all around the little town
there was nothing but desert and hills
and the heat of the noonday sun was blis-
tering

  not far away were the mine buildings
propped up into the hills and across the
track was the station building with a huge
black-and-white sign bearing the name of
the town  sphinx

  after perceiving enough to fill him
with disgust sam entered the small sta-
tion where he made himself acquainted
with the agent and that official explained
matters

  he said that the regular night oper-
ator had quit and that he needed another
badly he said also that there was noth-
ing to do at night but - and here he
cleared his throat and began in a sort of
singsong to name over the things there
were to do at night

  sam listened to the recital for some
time then he took the agent firmly by
the arm and shook him

  forget it he cried angrily i
didnt come down here to be the handy
man about town tell me where i can
get something to eat and then tell that
chief despatcher to wire me a pass back
to town say to him that i cant take this
snap 

  the agent pointed out a little tent
shack which he said was where they  fed
people and sam went to lunch when
he returned to the station he found the
agent busy with his reports and on him
sam gave vent to his tortured feelings

   thats a fine hotel you have over
there he said with deep scorn  i had
to go into the kitchen and wake the chink
cook before the meal was started and
then i had to worry the waitress for half
an hour before shed serve it its a funny
town where a fellow has to work for
everything he gets then pay for it too

   the chief says he wont give you a
pass said the agent with his nose in a
big book  says youve got to stay here
and take the job thinks youll like it
if you get used to it
with his fingers crossed



  the chief says-what cried sam
horrified  say old man tell me that
again

  the agent repeated

  sam kicked his battered suit-case under
a table and spat at it then he stood
and gazed abstractedly out of the window
for a few seconds

   said i had to stay here did he  lie
inquired at length  say youre not kid-
ding me said i had to stay in this
town he took a long breath the
next time i go into a chiefs office im

 say  he broke out  was that ride

i	took from town out here worth two
eighty-five they sure hang it onto a
fellow when they catch him in a god-for-
saken country dont they two eighty-
five well ill just have to bump- the
conductor of the first passenger-train to
carry me in  my face whens the first
train due  

   it is due about five oclock

  sam looked uneasily about him

 say dont you know i am very much
afraid ill get to liking it here if i stay

going to have all my fingers crossed i
knew when i got on the train something
was going to happen you tell the chief
that i wouldnt take this job if hed give
me a sworn statement that hed fire me
within the week if i took the job id
be sure to make good 

   youll have to pay your far back to
town if you go said the agent dispas-
sionately  he wont send you a pass
you know

  sam took out his money and counted
lie had about fifty cents

   whats the fare he wanted to know
   two eighty-five

  sam looked shocked

he complained   and id rather never get
another job in my life than to do that

  the agent went on with his work si-
lently

  sam spent the remainder of the after-
noon seated in a dark corner of the of-
fice with his fingers crossed a great fear
was upon him that he might become en-
amored of the place and decide to stay
and he was certain that if he did he would
never see the outside world again

  the passenger-train arrived about five
oclock stopping only long enough for the
agent to load on some express packages
which he had received from one of the
mining companies

the chief says he wont give you a pass


the railroad mans magazine

  sam buttonholed the conductor as soon
as that official had alighted from his train
and asked for a ride to headquarters
showing at the same time his service let-
ters in proof that he was a railroad man

  the conductor grinned broadly when
he saw the name on the service letters
and he brought from one of his pockets
a telegram which he handed to sam

  the message was from the chief des-
patcher to the conductor and read

 do not carry operator named s mc-
 claren from sphinx unless he pays fare

a sudden burst of hopeless anger flamed
up in him  i wont take this job  he
cried fiercely  ill walk out of town
first 

   wouldnt the conductor carry you
asked the agent as sam entered the depot

   naw the chief spiked him whens
the next freiglit-train due in here

   theres a freight due about midnight
none before i guess better take the
job -

 nope ill try to catch that freight-
train if i miss her ill walk out of
town

the conductor grinned broad-
  ly when he saw the name
  on the service letters

  sam looked up from the message hope-
lessly

   say con he wailed  dont it beat
the dickens how a streak of bad luck holds
out when a fellow just forgot to cross his
fingers once i suppose you wont carry
me in now will you  

   cant do it now grinned the con-
ductor  if i hadnt received that mes-
sage id have carried you but now id
sure lose my job

  sams face was wrinkled into a mask
of gloom as he watched the train wind
away and lose itself in the desert

  it sure do look like nature was dead
set agin me he said disconsolately as
he turned back toward the station then

  sam spent twenty cents for some food
and returned to the depot to eat it he
found the agent locking up for the night

   theres no night-man here you
know he explained to sam  so i have
to lock up we sometimes have a fellow
here at night who keeps the light engines
alive that come down here to take out ore-
trains but therell be no light engine
down here to-night so theres  watch-
man coming on duty

   ore-trains repeated sam  do you
have trains of ore out of here 

  the agent pointed to a siding full of
box cars

  you bet he said with pride  have
two out of here every week and some-
with his fingers crossed



times more when theres a train out in
the morning they send a ione engine down
the evening before and the engine-crew
ties up till the train is ready the watch-
man has to keep the engine alive during
the night hes not here to-night you
see wont be a train out in the morn-
ing usually have one out on this day of
every week i wonder if i told the des-
patcher there wouldnt be one out in the
morning yes  think  did good
night

  sam sat him down on a truck and con-
sumed his meal in silence there was a
short twilight then darkness and sam
still sat there disconsolately

  after a while he was aroused by the
sound of an approaching train

    wonder if that mut of an agent lied
to me he mused as the train approached
 its sure a train going toward town and
its no more than eight oclock well if
shes afreight ill try to hop her

  the headlight soon hove in sight
around a line of buttes and bore steadily
down toward the station it stopped at
the end of the yards however and a few
seconds later the switch-light turned
then the engine puffed slowly into the
siding and came to a stop not far from
where sam sat he saw then that it was
a lone engine without cars

  after taking off their greasy overalls
the engineer and fireman slid down from
the cab and walked toward the town pass-
ing close to sam as they went

   i suppose that watchman is around
here some place sam heard the fireman
say as they passed  i dont want the
engine to blow up

    fles likely over in town some place
answered the engineer  hes heard us
come in and will be here before long he
never did fail to show up

   sam sat quite still for a long time after
the two had disappeared in the darkness
then he slid thoughtfully to the platform

   	the agent did forget to tell the des-
patcher not to send down an engine he
soliloquized triumphantly  and theres
no watchman here to keep her alive
some ones due to get into trouble

  at first sam decided to let the engine
be and not interfere thus he would
have some revenge on the fat little chief
but a new and better plan suggested it-
self and he pondered it for a while

    r r

    ill just take the engine on into town
myself he chuckled slapping his leg
excitedly  ill show that chief whos
who  -

  he searched about the station for a
while until he found a shovel the blade
of this he worked under one of the back
windows of the office and began to pry
after a little exertion the catch that fast-
ened the window broke with a snap and
the window raised clear of the sill then
with fingers tightly crossed he crawled
into the office and took his seat at the
telegraph instrument 

  he called up the despatcher and told
him that the lone engine had arrived but
that there was no train to take out in the
morning and that the engineer wanted to
go on to headquarters at once

   after asking a few questions and ex-
pressing himself strongly on this waste of
power the despatcher issued running or-
ders for the lone engine to run extra from
sphinx to headquarters meeting two
freight-trains and a passenger on the way

   sam repeated the order then searched
diligently around on the wall till he found
a switch-key hanging by the office-door
then he crawled out of the window took
up his battered suit-case and climbed
aboard the engine

   he had ridden on an engine many times
before in his life and had once or twice
run one while switching in a station-yard 
so now he felt no fear as to his being able
to run this one although he might expe-
rience some difficulty in keeping her hot

  he climbed up on the right side and
after peering anxiously at the steam-gage
and the air-gage he released her and sent
her puffing slowly forward to the other
end of the yards

   soon he was out on the main line and
speeding down the track with the lights
of the little desert town vanishing behind

    i wonder can i keep her hot  mused
sam when after setting a lively pace he
climbed down to peer into the fire-box
 she sure will take lots of coal

   he began shoveling energetically and
kept it up for a time then he slowed
down long enough to go forward along
the running-board and raise the head-
light curtain which the fireman had low-
ered before departing

   when he returned to the cab he put on
the firemans overalls jumper and cap


the railroad mans magazine

so as to look like the real thing if im
stopped he grinned

  on he rumbled over the silent desert
through the starlit darkness he passed
two lighted telegraph offices and at both
the light in the semaphore showed white
he found a time-card in the engineers
box on which he checked off the stations
as he passed them so as to know where to
meet the opposing trains

  at the third open telegraph office how-
ever sam encountered a stop signal set
against him he whistled for a clear
board but the light remained red

   i wonder now what hell be want-
ing he grumbled as he slowed down
 be like theyve found me out and are
going to hang one on me but ill bet
theres no one save the night operator in
that office and he can do me little harm
he stopped the engine before the de-
pot slid to the platform and strode into
the office

   whats your board out for he de-
manded of the operator who hung sleep-
ily over his instrument

   freight-train in the ditch on the other
side of the next telegraph office said the
operator without looking up

   the engine and half the cars slid off
the bank no one hurt though des-
patcher wants to know if you can run
down to the second blind siding from here
and pick up corbin the general superin-
tendent parks the chief engineer of con-
struction and a couple of surveyors
theyve been out on the desert doing some
surveying and rode into the blind siding
just in time to miss the passenger-train
bound for the city so they telephoned in
from a ranch to hurry something along to
pick em up

   parks has got to reach the city in
time to-morrow morning to attend a meet-
ing of the directors or therell be the
deuce to pay

   thats quite a history commented
sam  but how do they expect me to get
them around the wreck

   i dunno reckon theyll send an en-
gine up from headquarters or unhitch
one from a freight-train and send it up
to meet you at the wreck where itll pick
up the old man despatcher wants to
know if youll pick em up

   ask him if he thinks im running this
engine for fun of course ill pick em

up if i can find them in the dark is
that all  

   yep 

  sam strode out climbed aboard his en-
gine and puffed away into the solitude

   chief engineer of construction has
got to be in the city by morning has he 
he mumbled  well hell have to do a
lot of hustling if he does wonder what
ill tell em became of my fireman 

  he kept the engine going at a good
pace passed the first blind siding marked
by a sign-board on a post on through the
darkness till the headlight revealed a
man in the center of the track frantically
waving his arms up and down sam
slowed down and stopped and four men
with their luggage and tools climbed
aboard

  whats this asked the man who
first climbed into the cab and whom sam
took to be corbin the superintendent
 where did you come from and where is
your fireman

  sam blinked owlishly in the gloom

   my fireman is sick and i left him be-
hind he lied  the despatcher sent me
down to pick you up theres been a
wreck on the other side of the next sta-
tion and im to take you down to it an
engine from the other sidell meet you
there and take you on one of you fel-
lows will have to shovel coal if you want
any speed

  sam latched out the throttle as he spoke
and the engine shot away into the gloom
the two surveyors took turns at tending
the fire while the two officials perched
themselves up on the firemans seat and
conversed together in low tones

  ive got em buffaloed grinned
sam into the darkness  gee i won-
der what ill do with the engine when i
reach the wreck 

  it was not far to the next telegraph
office and here again there was a red
light in the semaphore

   i wonder what is the matter now
grumbled corbin  another wreck or
some other delay ill be bound

  when sam stopped the engine before
the station all slid to the platform and
entered the office

   the despatcher sayshe cant get an
engine up to the wreck for about two or
three hours yet the operator informed
them  the freiglit-engine that started
with his fingers crossed



better keep an eye out for them and not
run em down

  the five left the office and took their
places in the cab again the engine start-
ed on its way and was soon roaring along
over the desert

  the wreck had occurred at a place
where the track curved around a lone
butte at the top of a grade a broken
rail had evidently been the cause of the
derailment but as the train had not been

to meet you broke down  the hill and
the despatcher had to cut off an engine
from the passenger-train thats behind the
freight and send it on for you

   hasnt the wrecker been started out
yet corbin demanded

   the wrecker left headquarters about
thirty minutes ago and is behind the pas-
senger-train

   that about settles it parks said
corbin to his chief engineer  youll not

 whats your board out for he demanded of the operator

be able to make it in time to put the propo-
sition before the board and theyll sure
call the deal oft because we have delayed
so long

  silence in the office for a few seconds
then corbin spoke again

   we might as well run down to the
wreck and see whats happening perhaps
we can get things lined up for the wrecker
when it arrives

   the section-gang left here about fif-
teen minutes ago said the operator
 they were bound for the wreck so youd

going at high speed on account of the
grade no great damage had been done

  when sam brought his engine to a stop
a short distance from the wreck all
jumped and proceeded to examine things
by the light of torches and lanterns

   it looks bad anyway was corbins
comment as he looked about

  while the others were examining the
derailed cars sam went over the dis-
placed track this took but a short time
and then he ran off in search of the sec-
tion-gang


the railroad mans magazine

  sara soon had the section foreman at
the torn-up track explaining to him what
he intended doing the foreman listened
said that he understood and forthwith
sent one of his men to the caboose of the
wrecked train to fetch a large cable that
is always carried underneath a caboose in
countries where wrecks are common

  when the cable was brought sam ran
his engine as near the torn-up track as he
dared and the cable was hooked into the
front coupling of the engine then to the
only derailed car which remained in the
road of those wishing to repair the track

  then he slowly backed the engine down
the track the cable tightened the de-
railed car faced slowly about listed to one
side and then went over on its side clear
of the twisted rails

  the crash of the falling car was the
first notice the officials had that work of
reconstruction had began and they rushed
back to the track to see what had hap-
pened but when they arrived they saw
sams engine slowly backing down the
track away from them corbin cursed
and swore the engineer had gone mad

  but sam had not gone mad he had
merely taken the section-gang and gone
to a near-by tie-pile where the men load-
ed on a few ties then back he came
and the ties were hastily unloaded

  corbin thrust his head in at the side
of the cab and demanded to know what
was going on

   im fixin to take you on to division
headquarters explained sam  so your
man can catch the flier from the other side
which will get him into the city early in
the morning now you watch me do it

  there had been perhaps fifty ties bro-
ken by the derailment and about three
rails on either side torn up two of these
rails were still serviceable but the rest
were bent and broken so that they were
useless

  under the direction of the foreman
the broken ties and rails were quickly
cleared away and new ties substituted-
the new ties being placed as far apart as
was consistent with any chance of safety
thus placed they bridged the gap in the
track

  then the men placed the two good rails
upon the ties and began driving spikes
frantically when the two rails were
spiked in place the men hurried to the

rear of the engine and began tearing up
rails from the solid track

  when a rail was loosened it was in-
stantly carried forward to be placed in
the narrowing gap and when this rather
flimsy track was complete the train-crew
of the wrecked train was aroused from
their caboose commanded to release the
brakes of the remainder of their train and
let it roll back down the hill

  the trainmen and the enginemen obeyed
when they learned whence came the or-
der and in a short time the part of the
train that had not been derailed was gli-
ding smoothly down the hill toward a lit-
tle siding not far distant

  when they were well out of the way
sam climbed into the cab of his stolen
engine and while the rest looked on
breathlessly he ran the engine slowly
onto the flimsy track at every slow turn
of the drivers the track sagged from side
to side but it held together till the en-
gine crossed to the more solid track

   good for you mr engineer  cried
corbin as the four men climbed into the
cab  now let her out at her best pace
for headquarters and we will try to keep
her hot for you

   what about that light engine thats
coming to meet you asked sam as he
opened the throttle  we may meet her
between here and the first telegraph sta-
tion

   let her out anyway if youre not
afraid to take the risk ordered corbin
 well try to keep a lookout for her
we ought to be able to see her long be-
fore we get into her on this flat country

  away they shot sam crouching among
the levers the fingers of his left hand
carefully crossed on the throttleiiis lit-
tle eyes gleaming with excitement as he
searched the path of light ahead for a
sign of obstructions

  as they shot by the unwrecked half of
the freight the crew swung their lanterns
high in air and shouted encouragement

  corbin and parks crouched on the fire-
mans seat keeping a sharp lookout for
opposing trains while the two surveyors
toiled at the furnace sam seemed to
have gone mad with excitement and he
drove the engine forward at ever-increas-
ing speed

  at last he sighted the lights of the next
station but even here he seemed reluctant
with his fingers crossed



to stop he drove down upon it at al-
most full speed and when he did put on
the air corbin and parks were tossed up
on the boiler-head and the two surveyors
groveled in the coal

  once in the telegraph office and in com-

   come up to my office to-morrow i
want to see you  and then dived into the
big station after his chief engineer

  i will-nitgrinned sam as he
watched the super go  if the company
will give me my two weeks pay ill not

munication with the despatcher corbin
ordered the track cleared for his light en-
gine soon they were all in the cab again
with the required orders and the race to
catch the overland was resumed

  that race was a masterpiece of luck
and nerve sam seemed to lose all sense
of fear or judgment as he clung to the
wide-open throttle while the engine ca-
reened dizzily around sharp curves or shot
down long grades every one hung on as
best he could but tho two amateur fire-
men had the hardest time

  with but little coal or water left sam
brought the lone engine into headquarters
a few minutes before the overland ar-
rived as corbin swung off the engine
he called back to sam

be bothering them any more im through
with this business for a while

  fie ran the engine down into the yards
and hailed a passing switchman

   fley terrier he called to the switch-
man  come take this engine into the
roundhouse  im all in and sick besides
i brought the engine most of the way
from the other end of the division with-
out a fireman

  after the usual grumble the switchman
took the engine and sam with his bat-
tered suit-case slipped away into the dark
to find a park-bench to sleep on

  the next morning sam again climbed
the stairs to the chief despatchers office
he looked a little more battered and

 s w 	-

l wont have such a man as you on
the division


the railroad mans magazine

crumpled than was his wont and his fin-
gers were a little more tightly crossed
than was usual on such occasions -

   -ie entered the chiefs office without 
knocking slumped into the chair before
the chiefs desk and stared vacantly be-
fore him

   the chief looked up and his little eyes
widened with surprise

   well he said sharply  how did you
get here 

   i came in by the air-line said sam
dispassionately  i want my time

  the chief looked thoughtful

   how would you like- he began
no  wont take any more of your
snaps  cried sam fiercely  come
through with my time and ill call it
square

  the chief sat silent as though listen-
ing for a few seconds then as he had
once before done when sam was in the
office he swung around in his chair and
pattered into the trick-mens room

   he must hear the message when its
coming in mused sam

  as before the chief came back present-
ly with a message in his hand even more
than usual the message seemed to excite
the little chief

   this blamed division of mine is go-
ing to the bad he complained  some
one went and stole an engine from sphinx
last night theyll be stealing a whole
train next

  his little eyes wandered about the room
in search of something to vent his anger
on and they fell upon sam

   youre discharged  he shrieked
waving the message in the air  i dis-
charge you now i wont have such a
man as you on the division 

  this was the way chiefs usually acted
toward sam and his superstitious feel-
ings were lulled to rest he was sure now
that he would get his time

   dont do anything rash chief he
grinned-  you give me an order for my
time and well say good-by

   youll have your time right now 

 shrilled the chief and he sat down at his
 desk drew out a form and filling it out
 handed it to sam

   sam took the paper and scrutinized it
 carefully as if looking for flaws just
 then the door opened in walked corbin

   hallo mr engineer he said to
 sam genially  telling the chief about
 our phenomenal run last night that
 was a good one you bet say chief didnt
 we break all records on this mountain
 end  

   sam slowly folded up the slip of paper
 and put it into his pocket

     have just discharged this man
 smiled the chief uncertainly  you must
 be mistaken about him mr corbin

   corbin suddenly became cool and cal-
 culating

    discharged him since when have
 you had the authority to discharge an en-
 gineer 

    engineer mr corbin i thought
 you were mistaken this fellow is an
 operator and was in our service i have
 just discharged him

   corbin looked at sam for a few sec-
 onds in silence

    for heavens sake my friend he
  said  tell me how you happened to be
 running that engine last night

   sam calculated the distance to the door
 but wavered vanity and a wish for re-
 venge on the chief caused him to say
  ill tell you if youll swear never to
 blacklist me or have me arrested

   corbin promised and sam told him the
 story

   corbin laughed shortly when sam had
 finished the little chief was very red in
 the face

    well said corbin  we still owe you
 something for getting our construction
 engineer to the overland in time do you
 want another job on this division 

   sam positively did not

    id rather go to jail he said  but
 if youll give me a pass to the city ell be
 much obliged

    he got the jass

we like to be as useful to our readers as we can but because of the great popularity

please inform me the length of the new
locomotive just built for the atchison
topeka and santa fe railway which
is supposed to be the largest passenger en-
gine in the world

 how is water taken  the fly by
locomotives-h b dotiora pennsylvania

  	you refer no doubt to engine  
recently completed at the baldwin locomo-
tive works for the road mentioned and of
which a description and illustration appears
in the january magazine it is not the lar-
gest engine in the world but as you infer
can readily be identified as the largest in-
tended solely for passenger business

  the total driving-wheel base or length
between centers of the front and rear dri-
ving wheels is thirtyfeet four inches we
have  official dimension for the total
wheel-base or the length over all of the
engine proper which latter represents the
information desired by you but from the
other dimensions which we have an esti-
mate of fifty-five feet for the length of the
engine proper would not be much in error

  for the engine and tender a total length
of about eighty feet would be indicated the
weight on drivers of this engine is 

pounds and the total tractive effort 
pounds

  it is therefore much inferior in size and
power to the monster  of the south-
ern pacific described in the lantern de-
partment of the december number this
latter however is exclusively a freight-en-
gine and does not -interfere with the claim
made for the  

  	in order to save time  fast runs
by filling the tender of the engine while
the train is in motion it is necessary to lay
down a track tank  a perfectly level
stretch of track one-half to three-quarters
of a mile long

  this tank is simply a shallow iron trough
very similar to that which is an auxiliary to
coal delivery-wagons in cities say eight
inches deep and twelve inches wide kept
supplied with water from the ordinary
water-tank one of which is usually located
at cither end of the track tank and with
automatic control to always maintain the
height of water in the latter at the desired
level

  the apparatus  the tender for scoop-
ing the water is simple consisting mere-
ly of a scoop under the center of the tender




the railroad mans magazine

to fit the track trough the end of this
scoop is continued by a pipe which turns up
behind the end of the lender and finally
empties down into its interior

  when it is desired to take water the scoop
is dropped into the tank either by a lever
or a piston operated by compressed air the
mouth of the scoop having say eight inches
vertical opening drops four inches into the
water and the speed of the train over the
trough results in the water being forced
readily into the tender

  proper signals by day and lights by night
are placed to indicate the points where the
scoop should be lowered or raised to avoid
damage

are any female engineers running engines
l in the united states and if so how
many-e m b wheeling west vir-
ginia

  none of record there is a story how-
ever current in your own section at the
time when the editor of this department
fired an engine for a living that a woman
operated the sole locomotive on the branch
from volcano junction to volcano west
virginia

  this little railroad a very few miles long
abutted from the junction mentioned about
midway of the famous old  fifth division 
of the baltimore and ohio which with its
twenty-three tunnels and seventeen bridges
or vice versa extends from grafton to
parkersburg a mosaic on the main line of
that roads st louis and cincinnati line

  there is no wilder country now in all the
expanse this side of the mississippi than this
historic section and this was twenty-five
years ago the thought was never recalled
until awakened by the receipt of your letter
but there is now a lively recollection that
a woman did have charge of this ancient
volcano engine in the dual capacity of
engineer and fireman

  perhaps some of our baltimore and ohio
friends in that section will confirm this
reminiscence we do not know even
whether the old volcano railroad has passed
away but certainly this story must have had
some foundation in fact

why is it that a locomotive or car-
wheel tire is wider than the upper
surface of the rail or vice versa
why are they not made the same width
i have noticed old wheels on old locomo-
tives and cars and there is always present
an ugly uneven groove on the tire of the
wheel would it not be better to have the
tire wear down even by having an equally as
wide rail and wheel-tire-v c y los
angeles california

  if the tires were not wider than the upper
surface of the rail the vehicle which they
were under would be derailed in rounding
curves for instance taken an engine of
but fifteen feet six inches rigid wheel-base
and although we have many examples in this
country longer than that the tires on the
two middle drivers of this engine are never-
theless nearly off the rail in rounding a
twenty-two-degree curve even though the
tires are six inches wide

  of course a twenty-two-degree curve is
exceptional in railroad construction in this
country but it is well to have exaggerated
conditions to emphasize the statement al-
ways bear in mind that the driving wheels of
a locomotive are rigidly spaced in relation to
one another and that there can be no flexi-
bility of movement between them

 the entire arrangement so far as the
total driving wheel-base is concerned moves
in a straight line no matter whether the
track over which it moves is curved or not
it merely remains for you to lay down
paper two curved lines representing a por-
tion of track and within these lines place a
straight stick or rule to appreciate what
would happen if the tires and rail-heads
were of the same width

  the groove which you mention is natural
wear it is allowed to reach certain pro-
portions say eight thirty-seconds of an inch
deep when the tires must be removed and
their tread returned in a lathe to the stand-
ard contour

                                                     

    f lansing michigan-your question
-l regarding the best practise in the
spacing of fence-posts has awakened so
much discussion among the various road-
masters to whom it has been submitted that
we cannot answer in any way which would
be of value to you would suggest that as
the peculiarity mentioned seems to be con-
fined to your section inquiry be made direct
of some roadmaster or supervisor
by the light of the lantern



  there is no doubt some good reason why
they should be spaced as closely as you say
and we would also appreciate the informa-
tion as we have a natural lively interest in
these matters

  there is nothing to be gained in lubricating
journal-boxes on cars from the locomotive
rather an endless confusion would resul
there are enough auxiliaries on a locomo-
tive now to harass a man who has about all
he wants to do to watch the water and the
signals ample provision is also in evidence
for each journal-box to be self-supporting
 the road and although the hot-box ques-
tion may still be called a problem it is really
nothing from the view-point of the vast
number of boxes which run every day with-
out heating

  the plan which you propose from your
brief description would imply the direct
application of oil to the various journal-
boxes from a reservoir on the locomotive
and when it is recalled that  a fifty-car
freight-train there are four hundred boxes
it may be imagined that the expense at-
tached to this operation even if practicable
would render the scheme prohibitive as it
is now the journals and boxes are gener-
ously proportioned to sustain their percent-
age of the total load and to provide the
proper area of lubrication for the bearing
surface

  they are surrounded practically by satu-
rated packing and capillary attraction
through the packing strands secures ade-
quate and uniform lubrication as a rule
there is only one or maybe two hot boxes

	a train at the same time and we cannot
imagine what system of piping you could
devise to enable these hot ones to be indi-
vidually treated from the locomotive with-
out deluging all the others with oil which
they do not need

what is combustion and how is it ob-
tained 

         	is a tandem-connected engine
one whose eccentrics are not on the main
axle 

  	where can i get a book  steam
heat as used in passenger-train service-
j h m marion o

  	the act of combustion as well defined
iu the instruction book issued to its firemen by
the erie railroad results  from a strong
natural tendency which oxygen and carbon
have for one another the carbon being the
fuel and the oxygen the supporter of com-
bustion but they cannot unite freely until
a certain high temperature is reached when
they combine very rapidly with violent evo-
lution of light and heat

  there are other forms of combustion be-

sides that known as burning the rusting of
iron and the explosion of gunpowder being
examples respectively of very slow and very
rapid combustion oxygen is the most
abundantly diffused element in nature

  it is never found existing in a pure state
but in combination with all other elements
except one eight-ninths of all the water on
the globe by weight is oxygen and nearly
one-fourth of the weight of the atmospheric
air is oxygen the fuel used for steam ma-
king is composed of carbon or the com-
pounds of carbon and hydrogen

  carbon is the principal element found in
trees and in all woody liber and is the
fundamental ingredient of all kinds of coal
the ordinary run of american bituminous
coal contains from  to  per cent of fixed
carbon which makes the coke and from

	to  per cent of volatile substances
which burn with a lurid flame and supply
the ingredients of coal gas

  these inflammable compounds are known
as hydrocarbons being combinations of
hydrogen and carbon anthracite coal dif-
fers from other coals in the fact that it
contains principally fixed carbon with but
little volatile matter

  good anthracite contains as high as 
per cent of pure carbon having mentioned
the leading elements which take part in
keeping a fire burning the following is the
action which takes place in the fire-box of a
locomotive

  when the air drawn violently through
the grates by the suction of the exhaust
strikes the glowing fuel the oxygen in the
air separates from the nitrogen and com-
bines with the carbon of the coal and the
hydrocarbon gases distilling from the coal
which have intense heating properties

  one pound of carbon uniting with oxygen
to form carbon dioxid generates 
units of heat or sufficient to raise eighty-
five pounds of water from the temperature
of the tender tank to the boiling-point
when a fire-box is properly fired and is
burning good coal with admixture of twenty
pounds of air to each pound of coal con-
sumed the fire-box temperature will be
about  fahrenheit

  the question of combustion is rather too
extensive to discuss within the necessary
space limitations of this department but it
is nevertheless one of supreme importance
to railroad companies and of late practically
every road is making efforts to educate its
firemen to an appreciation of the scientific
principles involved this is especially to
the point when a person stops to figure what
the outcome to the company would be if
each fireman was tosave say twenty-five
dollars monthly in coal


the railroad mans magazine

  there is no doubt but that this could be
easily done as assuming coal to cost the rail-
roads no more than one dollar per ton there
is certainly twenty-five tons wasted by a
great many indifferent firemen each and
every month on a road having  en-
gines this would amount to the comfortable
sum of  per year and may be taken
to represent the difference between success
and failure in the proper tiring of locomo-
tives

  	a tandem locomotive is essentially
one of the compound type and is so desig-
nated because cylinders are placed tandem
fashion the high-pressure cylinder ahead of
the low-pressure the position of the eccen-
trics is  different than  any other type
of engine generally  the main axle al-
though there is  reason why they should
not be located  the second axle

  	we appreciate the difficulty you have
experienced in locating a simple handbook on
the operation and care of the steam-heat line
as we have not been able to find anything of
the kind in the technical bookstores each
railroad however issues a manual on the
subject for the information of its own em-
ployees and possibly you can secure one
of these from a friend in the business

hf w minneapolis minnesota-any

	vehicle in rounding a curve whether
car locomotive or automobile tends toward
the inside or short side of the curve and if
the speed is high and the curve short this
inside becomes to all intent and purpose a
pivotal point thus inducing the liability for
the wheels  the outside to rise from the
ground or from the track a compensating
feature in the instance of railroads is af-
forded by the elevation of the outside rail
of the curve and this is equally applicable
to banking the turns on automobile speed-

in your january magazine i notice in an
article- an attempt was made to shunt
three lackawanna cars onto a trestle at
newark etc i have been railroading thir-
teen years and havent heard of  shunt 
before will you endeavor to tell me what
 shunt  means and how it is done-h n
p billings montana

   shunt  simply means to switch it used
to be a common application to this opera-
tion even in the book of rules of many
railroads up to a comparatively recent pe-
riod in england and her possessions
switching engines are shunting engines and
all switching movements as you understand
them are shunting

  this word is tabooed in american railroad
practise and the editor of this department
never employs it herein but whoever wrote
the article referred to in which you no-
ticed it was entirely within his rights as
it is permissible in story-writing and special

greater apparent distance than those on
the low or inside but it is advanced that
there is a slight drag or slip in the instance
of the wheels on the inside of the curve

  this premise and the fact of the tires
being tapered to allow the wheels  the
high side to run on their largest diameter
permits the rounding of the curve no mat-

pb a new york new york-the

	union switch and signal company
swissvale pennsylvania were practically
the pioneers in the development of the elec-
tric automatic block signal this is an
american invention but we cannot say to
what genius in the employ of that company
the idea should be credited would sug-
gest that you write them for that portion of
the literature which they issue concerning
their various outputs which deals with the
history of electric signaling

  electric block signals were installed by
the old colony railroad now a part of the
new york new haven and hartford in
 and this is the earliest application of
which we can find any record in brief
electric automatic block signals are con-
trolled by electro-magnets actuated by an
electric current flowing through the rails of
that portion of the track which constitutes
the section to be protected

  from a battery at the outgoing end of the
section the current flows through the right-
hand rail to the signal at the entering end
thence through the coils of a relay at that
signal and back through the left-hand rail
to the battery the track being free from
all vehicles the relay is energized by the
current and by means of a magnet holds
the signal in the safety or  all clear  posi-
tion

  the presence of a train or car in the
section deenergizes the relay by making a
short path for the current through wheels
and axles from one rail to another and
thus allows the signal to change by gravity
from all clear to the stop position

what part of a drive-wheel  an en-
gine does not turn when the engine
is in motion

   will an injector work with the check
 the top of the boiler-j w leaven-
worth washington

  	the exact center which position of
course would be the center of the axle on
which the driving wheel is mounted the
only movement possessed by this point is

progressive dependent upon and in the
same ratio with the speed of the vehicle or
locomotive on the rails

   the pressure opposing the working
of the instrument would be the same with
the check so arranged as though the water
entered below the water level in the boiler
but as all injector checks leak to a certain
extent which though slight with water
would be very prominent with steam the
working of the injector would be affected
with the results quite unsatisfactory

  even if this were not a consideration it
would be absurd to so arrange a check as the
effect of the relatively cold water dis-
charged into-the live-steam space of the
boiler would certainly operate against the
free steaming qualities which locomotive
boilers above all other types must undoubt-
edly possess to meet the stringent demands
upon them

please tell me the derivation and mean-
ing of  ex as used in the following
illustration   one case porcelain ex
s s china etc

  	has any attempt ever been made to
muffle or silence the exhaust of locomotives
-p j f new york new york

  	the general freight-agent of a promi-
nent railroad advises that it means  out of
or  from as  one case porcelain out of
s s china

  	it has never been really regarded as a
necessity except in the possible instance of
steam motors which are at times to be
found pulling freight-cars about cities or
in such environment where the noise of the
exhaust might prove a real objection it
would be a matter of impossibility on a mod-
ern high-speed locomotive with the draft
appliances arranged as at present to bring
about a muffled exhaust it is necessary
that the exhaust leave the stack free and un-
impeded and with considerable violence in
order that the proper vacuum be induced
in the smoke-box and flues to promote com-
bustion

  instances where exhausts have been suc-
cessfully muffled are afforded in the steam
motors which operate at night in the streets
of boston transferring freight between the
north and south terminal stations in fact
we believe that the law in some sections
makes it compulsory that whenever steam
locomotives are employed in cities the ex-
haust feature shall be so treated

jt

lj b fowler colorado-the argu-

	inent advanced as to why the wheels
of a locomotive on the low side of the curve
should slip a trifle when the entire machine


the railroad mans magazine

is rounding a curve is based largely  the
fact that the wheels  the high or outside
have a greater distance to cover than those
 the inside before the curve returns to the
tangent we know that in the instance of
any curve of high or low degree that the
outside rail is some longer between tan-
gents

  if the engine is say of seventeen feet
rigid or driving-wheel base this means that
from the center of the leading driving-wheel
to the center of the rear driving-wheel will
always measure seventeen feet for either
side of the engine  matter whether a
curve is being rounded or not

  as each pair of wheels being mounted and
keyed on same axle must revolve at the
same speed irrespective of whatever condi-
tion of track may be present it is logical
that to compensate for the apparently addi-
tional ground covered by the outside wheels
there must be a slip or drag to a small de-
gree on the part of the series of wheels on
the inside rail this does not mean that
these wheels slip in relation to those on the
opposite side but that they slide just a
trifle  the inside rail

  this is the presentation of the matter
which we can recall having heard more than
once from the lecture platform but per-
sonally we do not believe that this slip
exists it would appear properly viewed
that the progress of the locomotive around
llie curve is in an absolutely straight line
so far as its rigid wheel-base is concerned
a series of straight lines to better explain as
owing to the elevation of the outside rail
it is being continually dropped to the low
rail

  for instance it runs straight until this
movement is impeded by the contact of the
front driving-wheel flange  the high side
with that rail this contact drops it to the
low side giving it another chance to run
straight until the condition repeats and so
 until the curve is rounded

  this view we think is borne out by the
spread given the gage of the track  curves
the excessive width of the tires over that of
the rail-heads and the closer spacing of the
tires on the front and back drivers over
those on the middle drivers but we do not
insist upon it it is one of the most inter-
esting problems connected with the locomo-
tive the wheel-base of car trucks is so com-
paratively short that the question scarcely
comes up in that instance



kixdly inform me what is the best so-
lution for keeping dies cool in bolt-
threading machine

  	what is the best solution to use in
tempering dies-c h l ottawa kansas

  	lard oil is used extensively in the
larger railroad shops for this purpose and
it has many advocates but its use is ques-
tionable one particular objection which
appeals to us is its tendency not to run freely
in cold weather the end to be sought in
all lubricants for bolt-threading machines is
not so much the quality of the lubricant but
to get it where it belongs to the cutting
edges of the dies

  the editor of this department conducted
experiments covering a considerable period
to determine the best solution for this pur-
pose and could find nothing better or even
equivalent to monarch oil it was proved
during these tests that this oil not only keeps
the dies from heating but accomplishes ex-
tremely gratifying results in minimizing the
wear of the dies as well

  	there is only one proper way to do
this dip the die or tap after heating to
cherry red in w-ater and then draw the tem-
per to a straw yellow do not lose sight of
the important fact that there should be at
least one-half an inch of oil on the surface
of the water this to prevent any cracking
of the steel

  endless experiments have been made with
solutions for the purpose which you name
but it has been found in the long run that
the intelligent use of oil-covered water as
outlined here is the most effective after
all and we dont heat much of baths and
solutions these latter days

br grizzly bluff california-would

	suggest that you take up the question
of metal saws with fairbanks morse 
company chicago illinois as our sources
of information regarding the sizes and price
of these implements are somewhat unsatisfy-
ing we feel quite sure that this company
will be pleased to furnish you with full in-
formation

  in regard to the cost of new locomotives
this varies of course dependent upon what
locomotive buildershave to pay for the stuff
which enters into their composition this
is variable to a greater degree than might be
looked for iff a presumed well-regulated
business for instance we have in mind a
railroad which- one yea- paid  each
for a number of large size up-to-date pa-
cific type passenger engines and the very
next year secured several duplicates of these
engines and with some improvements added
for 

  this latter quotation however is very low
for this type of power broadly speaking
 represents the cost of all classes of
power of the present day unless some un-
usual type is under consideration such as
by the light of the lantern



an articulated compound when it may rise
to  these figures however will 
doubt serve in furnishing you with the gen-
eral information desired

on a train a mile long moving at the
rate of a mile a minute two men are
standing-one  either end the
man at the rear has a gun which can dis-
charge a bullet at the rate of a mile a min-
ute can he shoot the man on the front end
of the train-n d m butte montana

  it would be the same as though the victim
had been fired at on stationary ground and
it can be reasoned did space permit that
all features involved viz the two men the
train and the bullet bore the same relation
to one another as though the incident had
not transpired  a moving object this is
a question whether in this guise or not
which always invites the liveliest comment
and the editorial carpet and puzzle depart-
ment have frequently thrashed over the pros
and cons of it

what railroad systems in the united
states have so far installed the tele-
phone system in despatching trains
-a r florence kansas

  the low-grade division of the pennsyl-
vania between columbia and parkersburg
pennsylvania a distance of thirty-eight and
four-tenths miles has been operated by tele-
phone supplemented by block signals since
august  the average number of trains
handled daily on this section of the road is
ninety-five the lake erie alliance and
wheeling is operating its line of one hun-
dred miles of single track by telephone ex-
clusively and has been doing so for some
years

  the chicago burlington and quincy dur-
ing the early part of  installed the tele-
phone for despatching service  its main
line between aurora and mendota a dis-
tance of forty-six miles aurora and chi-
cago a distance of thirty-seven miles and
between aurora and savannah a distance
of one hundred and eight miles

  in addition to the roads mentioned the
following large roads are installing telephone

despatching systems and expect to operate
by this system exclusively the illinois cen-
tral the lake shore and michigan southern
the canadian pacific the chicago milwau-
kee and st paul the chicago and north-
western and the northern pacific other
roads among which may be mentioned the
delaware lackawanna and western the
erie the baltimore and ohio the seaboard
air line the southern the delaware and
hudson the queen and crescent the michi-
gan central and the union pacific are ma-
king investigations of telephone despatching
and may install such systems

  we regret that we are unable to advise
you definitely in regard to what the santa
fe has done along these lines as our records
unfortunately are not clear you might
take the matter up with mr l m jones
assistant superintendent telegraph tope-
ka kansas who will  doubt accommodate
you with the information desired

tic alpaugh california-we do not

	know of any what might be called
standard railroad watches anywhere in this
country that is watches which a railroad
might insist on its employees carrying
this would savor a little too strongly of
graft and railroad men are quick to appre-
ciate such things it is safe to say that any
good american movement watch certainly
one of nineteen jewels will pass the ordinary
watch inspector

  any one of the various makes which you
may have noticed advertised to pass such
inspection will as a rule do so as the claim
would not be made if they did not possess
the necessary adjustment features and jew-
els to put them through we are not in
possession of the names of the watch inspec-
tors of the two roads you mention either
at san francisco or los angeles

  as a rule these inspectors are merely
jewelers doing business in the towns along
the railroad to whom the employees must
take their watches for examination at peri-
odic intervals a certificate is then issued
covering the time to intervene before the
next inspection and this certificate is for-
warded to the division superintendent for

 going ninety miles an hour

it may be possible to make the run between new york city and
philadelphia in the near future in one hour
and forty-five minutes

there are few if any cities in the uni-
ted states which can boast of an inter-
communicative train service superior to that
maintained by the philadelphia and reading
railway and the pennsylvania railroad be-
tween new york and philadelphia the
fastest trains on both roads make the run in
two hours and as this includes the time re-
quired to ferry passengers across the hud-
son river the distance of approximately
ninety miles between jersey city and phila-
delphia must be covered in about one hour
and forty-five minutes including stops of
which at least two are always made the av-
erage speed is thus about  miles per hour

  train no  leaves philadelphia at s
am and is scheduled to stop at columbia
avenue wayne junction and elkins park
the last named a suburban station  miles
from the philadelphia terminal the sx
miles from elkins park to jersey city are
scheduled to be run in  minutes equiva-
lent to  miles an hour i the present
instance the train was composed of one com-
bination baggage and smoker one coach one
diner and two pullmans estimated to weigh
between  and  tons

  the engine was no  a three-cylinder
single-expansion atlantic type with super-
heater the cylinders are is x  inches
and the drivers so inches in diameter

slowed down several times

  previous to its arrival at elkins park the
train was slowed several times and it left
the station at  instead of at  as
per schedule the locomotive accelerated
rapidly and bethayres six miles from el-
kins park was passed at a speed of nearly
 miles per hour between this point and
the delaware river there are a number of
favorable stretches for high speed and the
maximum recorded was  seconds lo the
mile equivalent to  miles per hour

  at mile-post  speed was reduced to scoop
water and the train started up the grade of
 feet per mile east of the delaware river
at about  miles per hour

  this grade is easier toward the summit
where the slope is  feet per mile its total
length is about five miles and the summit

was passed at a speed of nearly  miles
per hour

  on the favorable stretch east of hopewell
the speed increased rapidly and at three
points reached  miles per hour  seconds
per mile near mile-post  a sharp reduc-
tion took place incident to crossing the le-
high valley tracks at grade and running
through the junction of the readings new
york branch and the central railroad of
new jersey bound brook was passed at
moderate speed and the remainder of the
run calls for no special comment jersey
city was reached in advance of schedule
time at 

this is going some

the following facts are worthy of note

  the highest speed recorded was  miles
per hour 

  the  miles from mile-post  to mile-
post  were run in  minutes  seconds
at an average speed of  miles per hour

  the  miles from mile-post  to mile-
post  were run in  minutes  seconds at
an average speed of  miles per hour

  the  miles from elkins park to mile-
post  were run in  minutes  seconds
at an average speed of  miles per hour

  the entire distance of  miles from el-
kins park to jersey city were run in 
minutes  seconds at an average speed of
 miles per hour

  if the average speed of  miles per
hour had been maintained for the last 
miles the train would have reached jersey
city at  this fact certainly suggests
the entire possibility if not the feasibility of
running from philadelphia to new york in
one hour forty-five minutes including the
ferry across the hudson

  this run was of course made without
special preparation and took place  a
snowy morning with a consequently wet rail
it is of special interest in that if was per-
formed by an experimental locomotive pos-
sessing features new to american practise
the engine accelerated the train rapidly and
appeared to handle it with great ease-

             interstate commerce and two happy
             hearts laugh at law and locksmiths

fle was beaming with the joy of
life this very pretty young
woman-who boarded no 
at eastley and the glow of
her face became a radiance
when she shook hands with
bob gurney the veteran con-
ductor on that division of the r s
and t

  she had a big bouquet of flowers for
him too which he accepted with even
more than his customary cordiality he
led her to the most comfortable spot
in the car and they chatted gaily every
moment he could spare from his duties
tih she arrived at rigdon

  i had made the trip often and knew
gurney well in fact i always looked
forward to the ride because this prince
of good fellows nearly always had a new
story and a bunch of diverting conver-
sation which beguiled away the time but
this day he looked over at me with an ex-
pression on his face which declared that
his excuse for neglecting me was evident
and sufficient

   whoses your friend i asked as
we pulled out of rigdon

  there must have been a suggestion of
impudence in my voice

   see here he said at length  i
know you and know you dont want to
get gay of course there are a great
many misguided young women who are
dazzled by the glare of a uniform and
dont seem to care much whether it is
worn by policeman fireman or soldier

  they are usually too silly to be al-
lowed to live and are an eternal nuisance
this case is different and to knock any
absurd ideas out of your head ill tell
you the whole story

   five years ago to-day i was making
this same run and at gowan station
went into the telegraph-office for orders
there wasnt any but jasp ledley the
operator said to me

    youve got a runaway couple on
board aint you 

   i didnt know and didnt care it
was not unusual for when old squire
ball was alive holdenburg indiana
just across the river from trumanville
kentucky was a regular gretna green

   eloping couples from all this part of
the country went to holdenburg and the
old squire tied the knots for them at
all hours i carried such couples nearly
every trip and they had long ceased to
be a novelty i told ledley so

    well he explained  this seems to
be a somewhat unusual pair a message
just passed over the wire to the chief of
police of trumanville telling him to
search this train and arrest agnes dow-
ney who is headed for holdenburg with
george hopple

   i went back to the train and soon
spotted the couple she was a beauty
and i rather liked his looks it was
very evident what they thought of one
another for when i stopped to talk to
them they looked decidedly bored

   i rather enjoyed the situation but

fas


the railroad mans magazine

felt sorry for them for i knew chief
phelps pricled himself on never letting
any one get away from him he would
certainly carry out his instructions

    finally i said to them in an off hand
way

    you two are running away to get
married eh  

    she flushed up in a minute and glar-
ing at me said

     why no  of course not the idea  
    he was more to the point

     id like to know what business that
is of yours was his demand

     oh nothing i replied carelessly

 maybe i am mistaken but a message
has been sent to the chief of police of
trumanville to arrest agnes downey-
thats all

  oh george what shall we do
she pleaded but george didnt seem to
know he looked worried so i let him
figure on the proposition for a while and
then told them i would do what i could
for them i wouldnt tell them what
that was but when we got to rigdon i
had a little pow-wow with ed caldwell
the operator and agent

    then i called the frightened couple
into the baggage-car and told them to
finish the ride on the trunks and boxes
and i might be able to sneak them
through they were as meek as martyrs
and obeyed me implicitly caldwell
grinning from ear to ear looked them
over made a record in his book and
handed me a couple of slips of paper

    it was only a short run from rigdon
to trumanville so i let them fret till
the town was in sight then i called the
prospective grooms attention to a little
scheme that i thought might pull them
through he almost wrung my hand off
just to assure me of his appreciation but
i told him not to do that until he was
safely past the guard at the depot and on
the ferry to holdenburg

   well chief alex phelps was on
hand all right and so was a big crowd
that had in some way got next to what
was coming off some wag saw the
shrinking couple in the baggage-car and
gave the alarm in ten seconds half the
male population of the town was crowded
around that car

   phelps plunged through the spec-
tators and peeping into the car shouted

    are you george hopple 

    yes was the unterrified response

    and is that young lady miss agnes
downey 

     yes

     well im sorry to do it but i shall
have to detain her and send her back
home on the next train

    oh i guess you wont george said
calmly

   now the chief was not in the habit
of taking any back talk and this riled
him somewhat

    ill show you whether i will or
not

   and with that he started to climb
into the car

    and ill show you george handed
him back  do you know anything about
interstate commerce

    whats that got to do with you and
the young lady 

     everything were it

     youre what 

    interstate commerce see these
tags 

   till then no one had noticed that the
youngsters had tags tied to their arms
and when george leaned over to give
the chief a closer view of his that official
discovered that the article to which it was
attached had been regularly and legally
consigned by express prepaid from the
station - agent at rigdon kentucky to
squire ball at holdenburg indiana the
young ladys tag read exactly the same
way

   the express wagon backed up to the
car

  how about it chief asked the
driver

    take em away replied the cus-
todian of the peace doffing his hat  i
really didnt want to bother em any
way

   the couple climbed into the wagon
and most of the crowd followed them
across the ferry i went too and was
the  best man there were no brides-
maids

    had forgotten the date but she
didnt they are going to celebrate to-
night and as caldwell and i cant at-
tend mrs hopple came out to see us
hopple sent us a message he said that
if they went through that way again they
would have to have four tags

  fine said riley shes a ball of
fire we came from saunders siding to
topstone with a full train last night in
twenty minutes and the pointer never left
the two-hundred mark

   thats one of punks pipe-dreams
said cyclone smith  punk knows he
couldnt keep a cook-stove hot anyway
and hes tryin to make us think hes a
crackerjack

smith ive heard when you was firm
they had to assign you to switcher service
because you kept tying up the road with
no fog if you dont believe the 
stayed hot last night ask con mccaffery
he was runnin her

   i wouldnt believe con if his mother
was dyin said the boomer  hes
worse than you are

   well then ask windy sanderson
he was braking the head-end and rode
from saunders on the engine

   windy dont know when an engines
hot anyway contemptuously comment-
ed the boomer

he dont eh well he ought to he

    i can fire anything you can anyway lired two years on the b and m and one

on the c y at least thats what he told
me though i aint succeeded in gettin
him froze onto the wooden end of the
scoop yet

   oh he fired on the b and m all
right and also on the c v  had him
the first trip he made on the c v and
he put it over me like a tent it was the
most sensible thing windy ever did when
he deserted the scoop for the side-door
pullman he does make a passable brake-
man but as a fireman he was a decided
failure

   how did he put it over you on the
c y boomer asked hash-bar

   well you see i was runnin spare out
of st albans and they called me one
tuesday morning to go to white river
with a train of wheat i had a date with
a girl in the restaurant at white river if
i could get there  and naturally i was
delighted when the white river extra
showed up was afraid id have to go
over to rouses point on the way-freight
but the extra was ordered out first

   when i got over to the engine-house
they told me i was to have the  a big
cross-compound fronr-tke grand trunk
and a new man named sanderson for a
fireman

   i got the  ready screwed down
the grease-cups where they were full
filled the empty ones filled the lubricator
oiled round pulled out to the water-plug
and still no fireman showed up

   i was about to go into the office to
tell gilbride the locomotive foreman that
i didnt -have any fireman when along
comes windy with a dinner-pail as big as
a small trunk and a pair of eyes lookin
like the relics of a swanton-drunk

    hallo matey says he  what kind
of a hog have we got here is she any
good  

     good engine said i  if you can
fire her

    well says windy  im a new man
here just finished my fire-trial trips but
ill keep her hot as i can

    thats all any one can do i said
 but i hope you keep  on
her because ive an engagement
down to white river junction
to-night that i dont want to
miss and i dont want to be
any sixteen hours on the road
either

   windy took water and we
started for italy yard after the
train i noticed then he didnt
act very green with the scoop 
and i commenced to pat myself
on the back thinking id have
plenty of steam for the 
really was a good steamer and
most any one could fire her i
did my patting a little too soon
as i found out before wed gone
very far

   we had a meet on the 
at milton four stations south
of st albans  to take the
siding- and if it hadnt been
down-hill goin into milton si-
ding wed never got there with-
out first blowin her up hot i
stopped at the switch with 
pounds of steam and just a bare
flutter of water on the bottom

gage-

   i spent most of the time at
milton while we waited for the

l spent most of the time instructing windy how
to fire the hog
neath the shade of the old water-tank 

four - eleven instructing windy how to
fire the hog so as to get the best results
he took it all in askin a few foolish
questions and looking about as intelligent
as a fat pig

   from milton to essex junction she
did a pretty good job never went be-
low  and most of the time i managed
to keep two solid gages of water in the
boiler

    was patting myself on the back
again and building more air-castles think-
ing that at last hed got the hang of her
but those air-castles tumbled about my
ears before wed passed jonesville the
 emitted a half-strangled grunt and
expired dead as a monkey-wrench about
a train-length south of the north dux-
bury station right on the steepest part of
the hill

   i said to myself  weary if you
want to keep that date in white river its

plainly up to you to fire this hog up the
hills so i shed my tailor-made raiment
and sorrowfully glued myself to the scoop

    from there to roxbury about forty
miles i shoveled coal keepin the pointer
at the two-dollar mark windy took my
seat and played engineer i looked up at
him a couple of times and caught a queer
sort of expression on his face as though
he wanted to laugh and didnt dare

    it would have made me suspicious
but  was too anxious thinking whether
or not we would get to white river in
time for me to escort that waitress to the
dance at west lebanon

    i hadnt fired an engine for a year or
more and had accumulated considerable
fat gettin ready for the cold weather they
have up there  and the way i fried out was
a fright  shed water enough to half fill
the tank from roxbury to white river
junction is forty-seven miles practically

i shed my tailor-made raiment
and sorrowfully glued
myself to the scoop


the railroad mans magazine

all down-hill and i heaved a huge sigh of
relief when we pitched over the summit

   say the way i dropped that train
down through east granville and brain-
tree resembled a kansas cyclone took
a chance on the order-board being set at
east granville and went down through
there so fast the station looked like a blur
the  had considerable lost motion in
her driving-boxes and when we went past
braintree she was rolling so much that
windy was afraid to leave the seat

   there he fairly hung with one arm
round the corner of the cab while the
other had a strangle-hold on the head
shacks neck

   i pinched her down to about twenty
miles an hour goin into randolph ex-
pectin to find orders there and sure
enough the board was out with a meet
on two extras at bethel

   we got to bethel all right and let
one of the extras go by

   but the other the  had one of
her usual balky spells and was stalled
somewhere between south royalton and
bethel with a broken intercepting valve
we waited three hours and forty - five
minutes for them to show up which put
all my hopes of meeting that waitress
plumb into clear

   maybe i wasnt some mad about all
i did from there to white river was cuss
the measly old railroad and chew my pipe-
stem by the time we got to west hart-
ford i had it chewed in two pieces

   we finally got put up about  by
which time the girl had been gone an hour
to make matters worse she went under
the escort of a woodstock brakeman

   of course there was nothing left for
me to do then but eat and go to bed i
dont like to retire just after feeding and
windy wasnt tired so we stood on the
veranda of the junction house talking to
batch the fellow running the 

   pretty soon along comes a b and m
engineer and his fireman i knew the
eagle-eye because he had shared my room
at the junction house the trip before
they both appeared to know windy

   he and the b and m smoke-agent
sauntered into the drug-store for a couple
of cigars and while they were gone i
asked the hogheacl if he knew windy very
well

    sure i know him he said  he

fired over on the b and m about four
years

    what  says i and you could have
knocked me over with a feather

    why yes he says  he fired for me
for nearly two years out of springfield
got canned for boozin

   well maybe i wasnt some crazy to
think of the way that crafty tallow-pot
had put it over me  didnt say a word
though i just bided my time and i says
to myself  youll earn your money goin
back old-timer

   we left white river the next morn-
ing with thirty-seven empties and the way
i pounded that engine was wicked didnt
hook her up over half-stroke from the
time we left till we stopped at the water-
plug at bethel and windy was kept too
busy shovelin coal to think of gettin
tired

   while he was taking water i sup-
pose he had a chance to think that keep-
in her hot didnt agree with the way he
acted going down anyway we hardly
got the tail-end over the north switch be-
fore he was apparently worrying again
and the pointer kept falling back even
with the injector shut off

  pretty soon he says say matey
shes heatin me pretty bad how i dont
know whether well get to braintree with-
out stalling or not

   we had a meet at braintree

    well says i  well go as far as we
can  and when that steams all gone well
stop and make some more

   when we passed randolph she was
pretty low on fog and was just about able
to keep going

   windy looks up at me and says
 matey if you dont take her soon well
die sure before we get to braintree

    i aint paid to fire this engine i
said

   about two miles south of braintree
south switch  heard something fall and
then an awful yell  turned my head
quickly and there was windy rolling
around on the deck throwing his arms
around and yelling like an indian

    oh my side my side  he yelled
clutchin at his overalls about where his
heart is located  i think  got appendi-
citis  

   his face was so black i couldnt see
whether he was pale or not but he acted
neath the shade of the old water-tank 

so like a balky compound that i began to
feel alarmed i hoisted him up on the
seat and fired the remaining two miles
to braintree where we headed in to the
side track all the time windy kept
moaning and groaning like an engine
with dry valves

    there is one of those third-class sa-
loons at braintree where they sell bottled
goods only and i hustled over and
bought half a pint of rum windy stowed
that liquor away without a blink  and
when we pulled out after no  had gone
-he dropped down on deck and grabbed the
shovel

    i was goin to fire her up to roxbury
but he suddenly seemed so much alive that
i concluded the liquor had cured him so i
stayed on the box

   gee the way that engine steamed

from braintree to montpelier junction
i hardly closed her stop all the way we
had to head in at montpelier junction
and do some way work and we were there
so long the effects of the liquor had
pretty well disappeared i could see when
we started out again that windy had an-
other tired streak coinin on but he didnt
complain any about his appendicitis until
i shut off for the old water-plug at mid-
dlesex

   id hardly closed the throttle before
he fell down on deck again with another
spasm

  whats the matter i said got
another attack of appendicitis

    yes he said  i guess im goin to
die this time sure maybe he groaned
 another half pint of that booze would
save my life


the railroad mans magazine

   i was good and suspicious by that
time  and though  had nearly a hundred
dollars in my pocket i said

    im sorry windy but i blew my
last thirty-five cents down at braintree

   the head man hadnt witnessed the
braintree spasm being back in the hack
at the time but he was a good-hearted
lad and he hiked off for another pint
there bein one of those third-class dumps
about a mile from the water-tank

   i took water while he was gone and
when he returned we started out with
the whole half pint distributed around
w indys interior

   the run from there to essex junction
was a repetition of the one from brain-
tree to montpelier junction couldnt
knock the fog off that engine no matter
how hard she worked

   just before we arrived at essex windy
commenced to get nervous again which i
construed as a signal that he was looking
for another  wetting  down  and sure
enough we hardly stopped for the head
man to throw the switch when he had an-
other spell

   i didnt pay any attention to him until
we had cut the crossings and stopped back
of the train-shed

     say feller says i  they have a hos-

training

the selection and training of motormen
to operate a fast and frequent servicc
such as that given by the hudson and man-
hattan railroad in the north river tubes
requires special precautions an interesting
feature of the employment methods of this
company says the electric railway journal
is the establishment of an intermediate grade
in which all candidates for the position of
motorman must serve for a considerable pe-
riod of time before being placed in charge
of regular trains

  this grade which is that of switchman
corresponds in some respects to that of fire-
man on the steam roads it provides a means
of training the men in every phase of their
future duties much more thoroughly than
would be possible by a short course of in-
struction in the shops or schoolroom and no
danger to passengers is incurred through
trusting an inexperienced man with the op-
eration of a regular train even under the
guidance of an instructor

pital in this burg im goin over to the
office to phone for the ambulance for you
what says windy as he stopped
burrowing in the coal he looked alarmed
and his lower jaw dropped till it looked
as if it was hung to his ears by a string

   i said im goin to telephone for an
ambulance for you i repeated

    i dont think i need any doctors now
said windy  i feel pretty good the
pain has suddenly stopped and  guess 
can get to st albans all right

    man said i  youre pretty sick
youre liable to die before we get to col-
chester and what would  do with a dead
fireman on my hands

    i aint goin to die matey says he
 and ill keep her red-hot all the way in
  well says i  if-

    hey boomer interrupted the call-
boy shoving his head out the office win-
dow  we want you for the wrecker the
 has a car crossways at yalesville
plugging both irons hurry up  

  all right shouted the boomer
starting for his locker on the run

  hey boomer yelled hash-bar
 howd you make st albans 

    she was the bull o the woods came
floating back over his shoulder as he dis-
appeared within the engine-house

motormen

  while serving as a switchman the new man
has an opportunity of learning first hand
the operation and construction of the equip-
ment how to locate and find trouble the
meaning of signal indications and the actual
feeling of a car or train in motion in
the meanwhile lie is earning a living-wage
and doing necessary work incident to the
operation of the regular trains

  only the best men are willing lo undertake
a switchmans work as a step toward pro-
motion to the coveted position of motorman

  another meritorious feature of the plan
is that the list of extra motormen is kept
down to a minimum since there are always
available switchmen who are qualified to
operate trains when required in emergencies

  a significant feature of this companys
employment practise is the fact that it pre-
fers to engage as motormen men who have
held similar positions on high-speed electric
railways or who have been employed

the birth of a flier

by olin crawford

a great flier is a demand satisfied ever important flier is put on
the road for the purpose of meeting the wishes of the public most
fliers are run at a loss for a considerable period after they are in-
augurated some never pay at all a flier represents the work of many men
in many different parts of the country it is one-of the finest examples of
coordination known to modern business this article will tell you how it is
brought about	

what has to be done when a train is hurriedly put on the rails to
break records in a run half-way across
the continent



difficult by the pennsylvania the dis-
tance was one hundred and sixteen miles
shorter than by way of albany and cleve-
land but the company had its heavy
grades to consider it is still an un-
settled question whether those grades do
not impose a handicap equal to that of
the roundabout course followed by the
centrals water-level lines

the cry from st louis

  still st iouis kept up its cry and at
last the railroad men began to study the
matter certainly such a train would not
pay at the beginning-not directly at
least they were sure of that

  there were however other possible
profits to think about the train would
be a big advertisement and more than
that it would stimulate the movements of
freight between the two cities

one day last october the new york
central after long consideration of the
expense of running a regular train at such


       twenty-four hours be-
tween new york and st
louis   that was a slo-
gan of st louis business
men for years they kept
dinning it into the ears of
the officers of the railroads for years
the men who rule the highways of
commerce between those points shook their
heads

    the amount of passenger traffic be-
tween the two cities doesnt justify-such
an expensive undertaking they declared

  said the men of the new york cen-
tral 

   from new york to st louis by our
lines is eleven hundred and seventy-one
miles a twenty-four-hour train would
have to be run at an average speed of
forty-eight miles an hour including all
stops two hundred and eighty - four
miles of the route are by single track and
every division for the entire distance is
already crowded with traffic

   other roads found the problem equally


the railroad mans magazine

a speed for such a distance decided to put
the twenty-four-hour flier into service a
meeting was called the president of the
company the vice - presidents and the
general managers of tire central the lake
shore and the big four were there

settling the details

  one of the first and most important
questions before them was that of the
starting and arriving times at the two
terminals what hours would interfere
the least with the rest of the traffic on
the lines what hours would be most sat-
isfactory to the business men and what
hours would meet the most important
railroad connections at the st louis ter-
minal 

  there were sure to be many differences
of opinion over each of these questions
and it took no end of discussion to decide
them and when at last starting and
arriving times of the east-bound train and
the west-bound were fixed came the diffi-
cult matterof fixing the time by divisions

  the time between the two cities must
be cut four hours and fifteen minutes and
much of that cut if the big four was to
do its share of the fast running must be
borne by that road

  already the fastest st louis train ran
close to the limit of speed for long dis-
tance over the central and the lake
shore sections of the route some reduc-
tion could be made in the time between
new york and cleveland but the big
four in spite of its long stretch of single
track must force the flier far faster than
any regular train had ever run over its
line

big fours share

  we can run the train between new
york and cleveland at the speed of our
twentieth century said c f daly the
vice-president in charge of the traffic de-
partment  the big four will have to
do the rest

  the general manager of the big four
found that he would have to attend to an
hour and thirty-five minutes of the cut
on his line extending from cleveland to
st louis it was a good deal of a prop-
osition with a single-track road all the
way from cleveland to indianapolis

crowded with passenger locals and
freights and a still heavier traffic on the
double track between indianapolis and

st louis

  the general managers returned to their
offices and each called in his division su-
perintendents to pro-rate the time on each
division

  on the hudson division between new
york and albany which is not one of the
hardest divisions of the system for speed
on account of its many curves the time
was cut twenty-one minutes for the west-
bound train from albany to syracuse
a cut of thirty-three minutes was made
and fifteen minutes from syracuse to
rochester

  from rochester to cleveland without
a single scheduled stop the time was cut
an hour and thirty-one minutes and the
big four was left with the problem of ma-
king up the remainder it was a prob-
lem worth tackling

switching the schedule

  when the running time was at last
fixed in all its details the schedules of
more than forty trains had been changed
to make room for the flier

  the news of the inauguration of a rec-
ord-breaker is sure to cause a stir from
end to end of a railroad long before
the new train was put into service it was
the main topic for gossip from the presi-
dents office to the roundhouses for days
among the high officials there was specu-
lation as to what its effect would be upon
the business of the company of what it
would cost and of how the time schedule
would suit its patrons

  among the engineers especially it was
a live subject for it would mean promo-
tion for some of them

making history

  when november  came which marked
the installation of the flier the heads of
the traffic department in new york were
all on hand to see it off on its sunday
run an electric engine drew the train
out through the yards and the tunnel to
high bridge where a quick change was
made to one of the highest type of high-
speed steam-locomotives-weighing with
its tender  pounds
the birth of a flier

g

  then up the hudson to albany flew the
train that was making railroad history
the fastest flier for the distance the world
had ever known fifty miles an hour
on an average for the entire division it
tore along and sixty miles and more 
straight runs

  less than three minutes to change en-
gines at albany then  to syracuse at
increasing speed again the same quick
change of engines and again at roches-
ter

  at buffalo there is no stop for passen-
gers but it runs around the city to buf-
falo compromise for another three-min-
ute change of engines then flies along the
straight lake shore track- to cleveland
at a speed sometimes reaching seventy
miles an hour another engine at cleve-
land and then the most doubtful part of
the journey begins

the half-way line

  almost twelve hours of the twenty-four
have passed and the train has been on
time to the minute at every point but the
two hundred and eighty-four miles of
single track between cleveland and in-
dianapolis lie ahead of it the general
manager of the big four has arranged a
schedule calling for an average speed
including stops of forty-seven miles an
hour for the entire stretch of that slender
highway

  allowing fur stops and reduced time
running through towns and around curves
an average speed of forty - seven miles
means that sixty-five and even seventy
miles an hour must be reached on straight
stretches in the open country that is
going some on a single track already heav-
ily loaded with freight and passenger
trains

  but in the dark morning hours the
record-breaker tore on through towns and
villages and farms and past long lines of
side-tracked traffic without a hitch and
still on time to the minute long before
daylight though it was sometimes the
glimmering lights of a station would show
a little crowd of people gathered to see
the train flash by

  there must have been faces peering
from the windows of many a farmhouse
in ohio and indiana that night to see the
southwestern limited make a worlds rec-

ord for it is out in the country districts
that that sort of thing is appreciated

  when the train left the grand central
station in new york nobody seemed ti
take the slightest interest outside of the
railroad officials there was no crowd at
the gate to see it start

where they notice

  in fact almost the only person there
was an employee of a rival road who had
been sent to count the passengers but
out in indiana as daylight came the
crowds grew greater

  it was a gala day in some of the little
towns where the flierroared by groups of
cheering people at indianapolis five
hundred people had gathered  the sta-
tion-platform

  the long stretch of single track had
been passed without a mishap and the
flier was still on time it was not until
the last lap of the long run had been
reached that trouble came at mattoon
where a stop was made for a change of
engines it was twenty minutes behind
time

  but there were still one hundred and
twenty-four miles ahead and it pulled in-
to st louis at  pm the exact time
the schedule called for from cleveland
five hundred and thirty-seven miles away
only three stops had been made-three
minutes at each place to change engines

beating the schedule

  that morning the east-bound twenty-
four-hour train had pulled into new york
ten minutes ahead of its schedule

  it had taken more than a month for
the railroad officials to study out the prob-
lems in the way of putting that train into
service during about the same length of
time the officials of the pennsylvania
which put a twenty-four-hour st louis
train into service on t lie-same day over its
shorter line had been studying problems
almost as difficult when a road decides
to put a record-breaker into service it
doesnt take a rival road long to get the
news

  it is sure to come to it through one
mysterious channel or another in plenty
of time for it to follow suit if it wants to
it was the same with the eighteen-hour


the railroad mans magazine

new york-chicago trains the central
and the pennsylvania started the service
on the same day yet there is no agreemnt
between the roads for the interchange of
news of such plans

rivals on the job

  seven years ago when the new york
central put on its twentieth century
train between new york and chicago
which for the first year made the nine
hundred and eighty miles in twenty hours
establishing a worlds record for the dis-
tance there was some doubt as to whether
such fast time would be possible to
convince themselves the officials ran a
test train over the road consisting of two
ordinary passenger-cars to give weight
and two private cars the test train made
the run in sixteen hours and the doubters
were satisfied

  then forty-eight trains were forced
onto new time schedules to make way for
the new flier and the record - breaking
service was inaugurated the first twen-
tieth century to chicago got into elkhart
and toledo from twenty to thirty minutes
ahead of time and the officials on board
were taken through the streets of those
two cities in automobiles which ran
through lanes of cheering people

  a year later when the time was cut to
eighteen hours the skeptics rose up in
alarm

  a menace to life was the cry
running a train at such speed is the nejst
thing to murder  

not near the limit

  but as a matter of fact eighteen hours
is far from the limit of speed at which
a regular train might be run over the
road the new york centrals officials
believe it possible to run a train from
new york to chicago in safety in four-
teen hours

  that would be at an average speed of
seventy miles an hour including stops
such an average speed would mean an
even greater speed for a good part of the
way but the company has no doubt that
it could run a train safely for many miles
at a stretch at eighty miles an hour

  a fourteen-hour new york-chicago
train however would be run at a ruinous

loss even the twentieth century has
eaten up hundreds of thousands of dollars
more than it has brought into the com-
panys coffers

   for the first two or three years it meant
a loss of probably at least one thousand
dollars a day nobody knows exactly
what the figures were

  with two twentieth centuries a day
an east-bound and a west-bound that
would have meant a loss of close to three-
quarters of a million a year so is it any
wonder that the officials ponder a long
time before they yield to the demands for
a new long-distance record-breaker

losses and rewards

  but there is some consolation for the
losses incurred through such a train it
was found in the case of the twentieth
century that there was a steady gain in
the number of passengers and that the
losses were pretty sure to be wiped out
eventually

   while at first the century carried only
from twenty to thirty passengers a day
it now carries three times as many

  then too it was observed that the new
train immediately stimulated the move-
ments of freights between the two cities
it was the natural result of putting the
business elements of the cities within easier
reach of each other

   just what it costs to run such a record-
breaker the railroads would give a good
deal to find out dozens of expert ac-
countants-the best that could be found
-have struggled with the problem in
vain

   of course it is a simple matter to reck-
on the wages of the employees on board
and the cost of fuel but they amount to
a very small part of the expenses to be
charged against the train there is the
wear and tear upon rails road-bed and
rolling-stock - an expense that grows
greater and greater with increasing speed

getting at the cost

  then there is the very important ex-
pense incurred through losses to other
trains that have been affected by the flier
and besides the train must bear its share
of the expenses of maintaining the road

  so difficult is it to reach any idea of
some famous traveling puzzles



what these expenses are that the company
is not sure whether the twentieth century
has come to be a paying investment or not

  the receipts from each of the two
daily trains the east-bound and the west-
bound are considerably more than two
thousand dollars a day or more than a
million and a half a year from both so
with the company in doubt as to whether
there is any profit left probably the ex-
pense of running the train comes not a
great way from that figure

  even the cost of the cars and equipment
of a record-breaking train amounts to a
large sum the great locomotive that
draws it costs twenty-two thousand dol-
lars and it takes nine such engines to
draw the twenty - four - hour st louis
train

  for such a train the sleeping-cars must
be of the best twenty thousand dollars
is often spent on a single one the com-

pany does not stint itself in fitting out the
pride of the road

and all the luxuries

  there must be all the luxuries there
must be a barber a ladies maid a mani-
curist and a stenographer in addition to
the usual force of enginemen baggage-
man stewards cooks waiters trainmen
conductors and porters a passenger
never travels so well as on a record-
breaker

  on one such train even the unpleasant-
ness of getting in late has its consolations
if more than fifty minutes behind time
the disgruntled passenger is cheered by
receiving his fare back at the rate of a
dollar for every hour lost there are
many more disagreeable ways of passing
time than riding on a record-breaker-
even if it does cost something

some famous traveling puzzles

the seven bridges of konigsberg and other mathematical puzzles and
chess problems which have attracted the keenest
minds for many ages

the ancient and university town of ko-
nigsberg is situated on the river pregel
which here forms an island called
krieiphof there are seven bridges over the
river live of which connect with the island
says j f springer in a recent number of
the scientific american in the earlier part
of the nineteenth century a discussion arose
as to whether it were possible for a person
to pass over all the bridges in one continu-
ous trip and without covering the same path
twice in fact this problem attracted the
attention of the celebrated mathematician
euler

  in order to understand the question clear-
ly refer to the map the start may be
made from any point the problem is really
insoluble try however you will if it be con-
sidered allowable to cross the pregel page
 by the railroad bridge below the town
the problem may readily be solved thus
beginning at apoint  d one passes over
the hob bridge then over the sclnniede
bridge to the island then back to c by the
kramer bridge one now makes a detour
passing over the pregel from c to b by

the railroad bridge then passes to the island
by the grime bridge returns over the kotte
bridge and goes over the hohe bridge from
b to d and finally completes the journey by
crossing the honig bridge onto the island
thus seven-in fact eight-bridges have
now been crossed and  part of the path
has been covered twice

  this type of problem may fittingly be
termed a traveling puzzle it is in reality a
very ancient kind of thing tims there has
come down to us from the time of pythag-
oras who flourished in the sixth century
before the present era a very simple ex-
ample in the shape of the pythagorean star
an illustration of which is annexed fig 
this figure may readily be traced by one
continuous line and without duplication of
the path

  a story is told to the general effect that a
disciple of pythagoras once fell sick at an
inn where he was cared for very kindly by
the innkeeper instead of getting better
however ik- grew worse at last with the
expectation of dying and being unable to
repay his kind host the pythagorean asked

for a board when this was brought lie
traced out the single-line star giving this
to the innkeeper he desired him to display it
outside some time after his burial a strang-
er happened along upon observing the star
he made inquiry and was informed of the
particulars related he then in order no
doubt to make the story complete handsome-
ly rewarded the innkeeper for the unselfish
care that he had bestowed on the unfortu-
nate pythagorean

  another figure of the single-line type is
that known as mohammeds signature this
is shown in the annexed
drawing fig  it is under-
stood to have been drawn by
mohammed upon the sand by
a continuous and unrepeated
movement of the point of his
simitar beginning at a and
following the course indica-
ted by the letters abc deb
fga one may see how it was
possible to accomplish this re-
sult

  an extension of the py-
thagorean star is shown in fig-  this may
be solved by following the routes indicated
by                      and
          i in these it will be no-
ticed that two or more exterior sides arc
taken consecutively if it be required that
this shall not he the case the problem is per-
haps somewhat more difficult nevertheless
it is soluble as may lie seen by following out
the order indicated by 

  we must not be deceived by the apparent
simplicity of a given case of this type of
puzzle thus fig  discloses the very simple
figure made by a circumference and two di-
ameters try as you will you cannot cover
this figure by a continuous line that nowhere
duplicates itself on the other hand figures
that are apparently very complicated fre-
quently admit of a ready solution

  thus the six-pointed star shown in fig 
may be quickly solved by the method shown
in fig  to work the puzzle given by fig

  

-that is the star of fig  with the inclu-
ding polygon-observe fig  this does not
in its present form perhaps suggest a solu-
tion for the reason that beginning and end-
ing at the point indicated we have  oppor-
tunity to draw the inclosing hexagon either
as a preliminary to starting or as a sequel to
finishing but at the moment when we have
arrived at the tip of any of the six points of
the star we may draw this hexagon and then
continue according to fig 

  refer now to fig  this is apparently a
very complicated design there is a very
simple solution h o w e v e r
which figs  ir and 
will assist in developing it
is easy to see how to draw

o a b c d if we do not start or end at
such a point we must recede from it for every
approach and conversely for every reces-
sion there must have been a previous ap-
proach approaches and departures are thus
paired off

  at a starting point however it is possible
to have a departure without a previous ap-
proach  this would occur when we begin and
only then likewise at a finishing point
we may have an approach without a follow-
ing departure this would occur at the end
and only then that is to say there cannot
be more than two points the start and
finish where an odd number of lines join
in fig  there are four such points-a b
c d this shows sufficient reason for pro-
nouncing this figure insoluble

  let us turn now to solid bodies and look
at some of the simpler cases take the tetra-
hedron shown in fig  it is certainly a
matter of indifference at which vertex we
begin so we start at a we have the choice
of three beginnings it is also evidently a
matter of indifference which of those we
follow so we pass to b here again the two
possible choices are alike so we go to c
here the two routes lead to differ-
ent results - c a completing a triangle
a b c and c d - closing  figure
first we try ca arrived at a we are com-
pelled to go to d we uave now two lines to
draw-d b and d c we may cover one but
not both so then we return to c and try
c d arrived at d we see that if we go to b
we shall be unable to go any farther so
then we go to a and thus are forced to c
here we stop with d b undrawn refer-
ring however to the discussion of fig 
we observe that the tetrahedron comes under
the head of the impossible figures as there
are four points where an odd number of
lines join viz a b c d

  fig  is likewise an insoluble case having
eight points where three lines join fig

is to keep the platform and yard cleaned up

  another variety of this same general class
of puzzle is the problem which requires the
knight to start from a position  the chess-
board and cover the whole board by a con-
tinuous scries of moves no position to be
taken more than once a convenient way
of trying this puzzle is to rule with a sharp
instrument on a slate the sixty-four squares
of the chessboard wherever you elect to
start the knight you mark  his next
position you mark  and so  the slate
enables false starts and errors to be readily
corrected this kind of puzzle has attracted
a good deal of attention and has received a
multitude of solutions thus we may in-
stance the solution given in fig  here
the lower half of the board is covered before
any beginning is made with the upper half
the two halves are precisely symmetrical
with each other as may be seen by referring
to fig  where the path of the knight
is indicated by a continuous line this di-
vision of the solution into two duplicates is
not necessary but is an added refinement in
one sense it simplifies matters as we have
but half the board actually to solve

  we are restricted however as to the point
of termination thus in the present example
the point of beginning  having been de-
termined the point -the beginning of the
second half-is thereby fixed so  must
come where it is at present or must be at
position  fig  is an illustration of a
solution where the resulting arrangement of
figures has some of the properties of a magic
square thus every column and every hori-
zontal line sums up  if the diagonals
each totaled the same number  then the
whole would form a perfect magic square

in union theres strength

rom the clock with the hard
  and judicial face perched
  high above the judicial
  bench came a sudden sin-
  gle clack like a rap of
  the judicial gavel

    half after twelve tis said officer
ahearne of the seventeenth police court
squad glancing upward  an his honor
adjourned fifteen minutes or more a
slack mornin for the old sivinteenth mr
leigh

  leigh the sole remaining representa-
tive of the press in the court-room nodded
absently he was making a rapid re-
vision of his last batch of  copy and a
messenger boy from the evening rscord
fidgeted at his elbow

  ahearne  unbuttoned his blouse and
leaned luxuriantly against the railing that
divided the law from the laity

   three plain drunks he went on
checking off on his fingers the cases that
had just been decided  wan a dis-
orderly wan in the thurrd degree wan

wid flat-irons between a brace uv laadies
over their kids a scant marning in-

  the other again nodded sealed and
handed the big  copy  envelope to the
boy stretched himself mentally and physi-
cally and gathered up pencils and notes
saying

   you ought anyhow to be glad that
the seventeenths improving pat

  the man in brass and blue eyed the
reporter in a meditative fashion

  i spose so he admitted but if
there was less morals in the old days
there was more money-fees for th clerks
an space fer ye boys an th small sarvices

  the insistent and muffled ring of the
telephone-bell came from the clerks

aliearne hastened to reply

  leigh smiled and produced a cigar
which aliearne eyed critically but accept-
ed gratefully the reporter took up the
telephone receiver

  that you billy came from the
other end

  yes whos this

   staynes of the sentinel

   hallo sam  how is it 

   good  can you drop in to see me
this evening after ive given out assign-
ments 

  certainly anything up

   tell you when we meet slong
brevity is the soul of conversation in the
newspaper world during working hours
leigh replaced the receiver returned to
the court-room and sent aliearne into the
judicial sanctum to ask his honor if there
was any late news worth the writing his
honor who in company with a cigar and
a friend was giving an hours grace to
dilatory applicants for advice or warrants
sent out word that there was nothing
doing

  the scene of these happenings is the
big sprawling and queerly circumstanced

-geographically speaking-city of mart-
port whose southern foot is bathed by the
waters of the atlantic the brineness of
which is scarcely tempered by the flood of
the adjoining great river martport as
it is now is a city of absorptions time
was when its boundaries w-ere the long
narrow queerly shaped peninsula in
which the business portion of the com-
munity is at present located

   but by reason of its situation it gradu-
ally sucked in the commerce of the coast
round about hence smaller and neigh-
boring communities found it to their ad-
vantage to permit themselves to be merged
into the larger center they lost their
individuality by the process but gained
in wealth and prestige

  so the martport of to-day consists of
five sections-that is martport proper
and north end which was ere the era
of expansion began  the consolidated com-
munities eastbay the marches high-
burg and the beaches

  each of these latter boroughs retains
its name for social and business purposes
but politically and in other ways they
are just martport-nothing more nor less

  the newspapers of martport have for
a good many years taken no cognizance
of the fact that some sections of the city
now are growing so far as the alinement
of their reportorial forces is concerned

  news-gathering is no haphazard occu-
pation as a good many people seem to
imagine without going at length into
the disposition of the working forces of a
newspaper office it is sufficient to say that
the staff reporters are divided into two
classes viz  department  or  dis-
trict and again  office  or  emer-
gency  men

  so far as the members of the first-
named class are concerned they are sta-
tioned at points or places where news nor-
mally drifts or centers such as police
headquarters courts of law precinct sta-
tion-houses river or harbor fronts city
halls etc society yacht racing sport-
ing and other  editors  are also and in
reality department reporters the emer-
gency men hunt up information relative to
any news item or  tip  that comes into
the office outside of the  department 
channels in cases too where the depart-
ment men find that they are facing a
story that they cannot handle by them-
breaking the combine



selves such as a big fire a sensational
murder or what not emergency reporters
are sent out to assist them

   in some instances where the territory
  covered -to use the technical term-
 by the reporters is thinly populated one
 man is given full charge therein and is
 supposed to look after not only the  de-
 partments but such general news as may
 accrue outside of these in almost every
 case where the hunt for news obtains in
 either department or territories the re-
 porters representing the several news-
 papers find it to their advantage to form
 a  combination

   the work is apportioned out among the
 men and then the resultant news is pooled
 and distributed each man getting the
 benefit of the labors of his colleagues and
 lie himself adding his quota to the general
 fund

   the combination system works all right
 if those taking part in it are honest but
 the contrary is the case if the parties to
 the  merger  are tempted to loaf it is
 an easy matter under such circumstances

- to do a certain amount of work-just
 enough to save the faces of the members of
 the combination-and stifle a whole lot of
 good news that normally should appear in
 print

   in other words the combination like
 the typical trust can limit the output of
 news to the detriment of the journalistic
 industry and the public as a whole

   the borough of highburg was origi-
 nally a mere hamlet by degrees it re-
 solved itself into the manufacturing sec-
 tion of the big city-a conglomeration of
 huge factories and machine-shops striped
 and dotted with streets or clusters of tall
 grimy tenements the population con-
 sists of immigrants who valuableon the
 score of their brawn and numbers are
 nevertheless undesirable in a good many
 other respects

   nevertheless highburg was reckoned
 by the newspapers as a mere district
 one reporter was deemed sufficient to
  cover  it

   appeals to the city editors for more
 help had in the past been fruitless and
 the outcome thereof was that highburg
 reporters had in self-defense formed a
 combination of a rock-ribbed sort in order
 that the territory might be compelled to
 yield a measurable supply of news

    r r 

  with the passing of time however the
combination began to develop evils
three-fourths of the happenings of the
borough that should have been put 
record never saw light being stifled at
birth

  the members of the combine were near-
ly all old hands they were hand and
glove with the local police captains
hobnobbed with magistrates and warrant-
clerks and stood in with court officers
telephone operators and district poli-
ticians

  the correct attitude of the newspaper
man in regard to public officials is ever
that of one of the parties to an armed
truce too much friendship between the
press and the other side of the house is
apt to lead to complications

  because of the chummy footing 
which the reporters stood in regard to
highburg people in authority many queer
things went on within that boroughs limits
that should have been brought to light
those who were responsible for them had
 fear of newspapers  and many of the
immune had proved their gratitude by
assisting in the process of freezing out a
new reporter who of his own volition or
acting under instructions from his paper
tried to work independently of the com-
bine

  in self-defense the city editor of the
new man would recall the latter and ap-
point a member of the combination in his
place immediately thereafter the output
of news from highburg would become
scant as to quantity and flat and alike in
quality

leigh sees staynes

teigh called on staynes that evening
- at about seven he found him sit-
ting at his desk in the sentinel building
the editor was void of collar necktie
coat and vest he was puffing at a reek-
ful brier pipe and glancing over a late
batch of the thin yellow tissue paper on
which come associated press despatches

  near him were other coatless men hard
at work writing matter for the morning
paper a dozen or two reporters were
lounging at their desks awaiting the un-
expected there was an almost incessant


the railroad mans magazine

j ingling of the telephone - bells and a
faint rumble from the presses in the base-
ment

  the two men greeted each other briefly
 billy said staynes  you are still a
fixture on the record i suppose

   i guess so said leigh  unless the
old man makes a deal with the enterprise
you know theyve been trying to rake him
in on a consolidation basis

  the  old man  was the proprietor of
the record william j bevins once
mayor of martport whose newspaper re-
sponsibilities were tempered with dab-
blings in real estate and after-dinner
speeches

   no chance of that said staynes
 bevins always did know a good thing
when he had it and knows enough to stick
to it thats why he made an iron-bound
contract with you billy

   the cigars are on me sam was the
laughing reply  but did you bring me
down here to chuck bouquets at me 
as a preliminary said staynes  im
going to spring the old one on you will
you come with the sentinel 

   cant and wont answered leigh
 and you know it

   as i expected then will you do
some work for us 

  that depends said leigh if it
doesnt interfere with the record in any
way im open to persuasion

    well said the city editor slowly  i
want you to buck that highburg combina-
tion and buck it good ridgely our
chief is mad over the way that ross was
compelled to quit highburg and has
sworn that liell bust the combine no mat-
ter what it costs hi n in time or money
leigh whistled  ridgely has taken a
pretty big contract on his hands and you
want to put it up to me but who is
ross

jtew man came on from boston

his people sort of sixth cousins of the
chief is a graduate from some college
course in journalism-a decent fellow
but a bit of a fool who had somehow or
other got it into his head that a reporter
is a journalist it was against my wishes
that he was sent to highburg

  he stood it for two or three weeks
he and the paper were treated shame-
fully

    from the little he let out to us he was

about as cleverly jollied and worried as
a college - bred journalist nose to nose
with the real thing can ever hope to be
anyhow he sailed over here about  am
one day looking white about the gills
chucked his resignation on the desk and
walked out of the ofiice ridgely is out
for blood so far as the combination is
concerned

   judging from a word or two that
ross dropped to me i fancy that the
highburg gang gave him a fake tip on
an alleged red-hot scandal the villain of
which was ridgely himself you know
that our old man is a copper-bottomed
moralist and the idea of his name being
mixed up with a yarn of the kind that
ross went out on has made him as mad as
a stump-tailed mule in fly-time

   so ridgely told me to hunt up the
best man i know to take charge of high-
burg and avenge ross and the sentinel
by squashing the combine or at all
events making it feel sort of anxious and
keep it hustling naturally billy i
plugged you for a game of this kind 
 thanks replied the other meekly-
 in a game like this though the peg is
likely to be put in a hole

   a joke by thunder but the points
denied you are to put the other fellows
in a hole

   anyhow went on leigh  i dont
see how it can be done bevins has his
own ideas about a man working for two
papers at once and im pretty sure he
wouldnt cock the kind eye at a proposi-
tion of this sort besides that-

   besides what asked staynes

   well i stand pretty well with the
highburg lot and the boys generally and
-oh hang it sam you know how it is
this business isnt what its cracked up
to be but we dont try to queer each
other unless we happen to hail from some
blooming alma mater

chapter iii
why vincent objected

teigh was voicing one of the several
- charges that reporters of the older
school are in the habit of making against
the newercomers - that the loyalty each
to each and the freemasonry that char-
acterized journalism in years that were is
breaking the combine



fast vanishing before the influx of recruits
from the  better classes

  what had at first been necessity became
habit and so the old-line reporter pos-
sessed a faithfulness to his kind that was
as unfaltering as ft was unselfish self-
sacrifice if a brother reporter was con-
cerned was the general rule

  it seemed to leigh that he was being
asked by staynes to violate one of the
fundamental ethics of his profession

  staynes understood

    look here billy he said quietly i
think you know me well enough to believe
that id be the last one to hurt any man
who deserved a show but i dont feel
any scruples about that highburg crowd
when it comes down to cases the combi-
nation is just a rum-soaked aggregation
of poker-fiends who dont attempt to earn
their salaries but hang on simply because
theyve got highburg cinched

   were just asking for what were
willing to pay for and that is the news
of the district we are being done out of
this as are all the rest of the newspapers
by a conspiracy of loafers it isnt fair-
it isnt right billy and its chaps of the
highburg kind that give the boys and
the business their bad names in certain
quarters people dont understand that
fellows like the combine men are the ex-
ceptions and not the rule

  leigh winced staynes had uninten-
tionally made a bulls-eye the reporter
and a certain miss vincent had had
an  understanding  for many months
leigh would fain have had it blossom
into an engagement proper but when he
sounded the elder vincent-an estimable
but peppery gentleman possessed of an
independence acquired through the me-
dium of a painters supply business-he
was told that no daughter of the house of
vincent should ever receive papas con-
sent to unite herself with a member of
 so demoralizing and dissolute a profes-
sion as journalism

   mr vincent in this connection recited
lurid tales of reporters doings as given
him by one of leighs rivals even the
girl herself had asked billy how he could
remain in a calling that as mr appleby
had assured her-mr appleby was the
rival-was the last resort for drunken and
dangerous characters and two days
later the show-cases outside of applebys

store-he being a prosperous retailer of
leather goods-were seized by the bureau
of encumbrances

   i have also had it pretty straight
went on staynes  that the combination
has raised the limit of its continuous per-
formance game-its a dollar ante now-
and nobody in the crowd seems to mind it
money seems easy with them since that
mainway contract deal he paused and
looked significantly at the other

  leighs lips tightened  do you be-
lieve this  he asked

   i certainly do i have my intuition
billy as well as my information but
apart from that there are joints running
wide open in highburg that would have
to close up right away if they were prop-
erly written up but theres never a cheep
about them from the combine

   why the logic of the thing is that
theres more money in it for the boys to
leave em alone than there is in going for
em only last week we offered double-
space rates to higgins of the messenger
for a story on the harrow street casino
and promptly got a hasty  no  from
him how does it look to you 

   it looks like dirty business replied
leigh slowly and frowningly  sam id
hate to think this about these fellows
but-if you-if i-could make up my
mind that it were so id go for them until
they smelled brimstone

  leigh was displaying another trait of
that complex creature the newspaper re-
porter-his professional honor

  remembering that leigh was a sturdy
example of journalistic fealty to ones
employer and ones self it is easy to un-
derstand how he was beginning to feel
toward the combine in view of stayness
conclusions regarding it

  it may be that his jealousy for the good
name of his vocation was none the less
assertive by reason of the estimate miss
vincent had placed upon it

  lastly billy resumed staynes well
make any terms in reason with you you
propose em and  think that i can safely
commit myself to declaring that well
accept em but if i were you id tackle
the job on space-

  space cried leigh why sam
if i should come with you-which t dont
say that i shall-i wont get in a couple
of columns a week after ive declared


the railroad mans magazine

myself you know that theyll head me
off everywhere and anywhere news will
be scarcer for me than chunks of radium
 precisely and youll then get your
mad up and proceed to throw things into
the combine and smite it and amass
shekels at such a rate that ill have to
cut your bills to keep you from busting
the cashier

  the reporter flushed  quit your kid-
ding sam he said  and ill think this
over i f i get my own and bevinss con-
sent to pitch in-which im not at all
sure that i shall-when do you want me
to start  

   soon as possible if not sooner and
billy im not trying to jolly you believe
me if i hadnt believed that you were
the right man for this proposition i
wouldnt have sent for you i like you
all right but not to the extent of asking
you to hold down a job that was aces too
high for you

   ridgely thinks im all to the mustard
in the matter of good judgment and id
hate to have him find out that he was
wrong thats why ive sent for you
leigh smiled the smile of a man who
wishes it to be seen that he knows that he
is being chaffed but enjoys it

  and added staynes ill do the
square thing by you you shall have a
weekly guarantee of an amount equal to
the space that im positive the district
will yield you at the end of three or four
months

  the city editor knew that to get the
best out of a man you must make him feel
that you believe in him

   thats very good of you sam said
leigh rising  and im half tempted-
no i wont say that youll get a note
from me to-morrow

  the interview ended and staynes tele-
phoned to his chiefs room that he had
secured leigh for the highburg district

  notwithstanding all this leigh was
nourishing a pet project the fulfilment of
which would mean his breaking for all
time his journalistic ties

  in a nebulous sort of way the germs of
the project had been with him many
moons and for several reasons including-
the little vincent girl

   but the idea did not take definite shape
curiously enough until the evening of his
interview with staynes the shaping came

about in this fashion after leaving the
sentinel offices leigh strolled over to the
press club there he met herrick her-
rick was a veteran in the business and
telegraph editor of the morning despatch

   pie and leigh finished their last game
of crib and the latter rose to go

    whats your hurry billy  asked the
older man

    want to grind out some of my satur-
day stuff to-night was the reply  go-
ing to the dinner of the old highburgians
to-morrow and so shall be a day shy this
week on my usual work

   herrick grunted discontentedly  same
old grind same old everlastingly turn-
ing out copy life for us just so many
sheets of copy day in and day out talk
about machine existences billy why
dont you get out of the business before
youre stuck in its mud as i am 

   how george 

   i was standing on our steps to-day
watching the procession on newspaper
row went on herrick musingly  and
about two-thirds of that procession was
made up of broken-down newspaper men
trying to borrow quarters the business
had sucked the youth and vigor and brains
out of em and then-like the bloated old
spider that it is-it had chucked their
empty useless carcasses out of its web so
that fresh victims could take their places

    not so bad as that cried leigh with
a laugh  not quite so bad as that
surely 

    but it is returned herrick  i saw
dozens of em-dozens men who in the
old days were splendid fellows-star re-
porters who earned just as much as they
chose and whose expense bills were al-
ways okd without a kick high-rollers
good fellows and now billy that hope-
less gray-liaired shabby unshaven line
of ghosts of the men who were ought to
be a warning to you-im too old to take
it-to get out and-get out quickly

    but said leigh gently  dont you
think that the men rather than the busi-
ness are to blame geerge 

    not entirely let people say what they
please replied herrick with a sigh
 when you subject a man to an abnormal
strain for twelve hours or so at a stretch
hes likely to look for some sort of abnor-
mal relief

    you get your midday assignment and
breaking the combine



you sweat blood over it for three or four
hours then you hustle back -to the office
and proceed to turn out a column or so
of copy at a  gait doing your work
amid sounds and under conditions that
would send the average citizen dippy
tis a joyous life billy and-cut it as
quickly as you can

  leigh didnt smile but again asked
 how george 

  how its a curious thing billy
replied herrick  that we can always find
out and look after and chase to a finish
everybodys business but our own give
us something to do that really doesnt con-
cern us but concerns somebody else and
were happy and will serve it up to the
queens taste

   but give one of the boys an assign-
ment to look after his own interests and
see what a condemned hash hell make
of it yet theres no class of men in the
world that ought to do better for them-
selves than we and none that do so badly
by themselves by the same token

   admitted said leigh  but again
how 

  herrick droned on we meet every-
body and talk to everybody and if we
chose could make friends of everybody
but do we no our cards admit us
everywhere and anywhere from the cell
of the burglar to the sanctum of the presi-
dent but do we ever realize our oppor-
tunities

   nope heaps of people-politicians
folks with schemes men with ideas-
would give their eye-teeth to have the
open door that we own but we just roll
along content like the chumps that we
are to barter our best-our years health
work and chances-for that measly little
slip of paper that the auditor shoves at
us on pay-days

  leigh with a shrug of his shoulders
rose to gcr

    stop a minute billy said the other
laying a detaining hand on the reporters
arm  i know i havent answered your
question yet but-but when i get to
thinking i get to prosing and-regret-
ting now listen youre young and
have an education that hasnt got frills
on it but is all to the good as far as the
essentials are concerned

   youve what in our police-court so-
ciety persiflagewould be called a  pleas-

ing personality you have a gift of gab
and a way of making friends you are a
somewhat crude but fairly close student
of human nature you know a whole lot
of people and you are familiar with the
machinery and procedure of the courts
you must have picked up more or less
points about the law in a layman sort of
way

   embarrassing things for a modest
fellow to hear about himself laughed
leigh  but admitting them for the
sake of argument what then 

  the answers obvious

   then i must be a dense one for i
cant grasp it

   its-cut the copy grind and go in
for the law half of the things that i
have named as possessed by you are those
that full-fledged lawyers labor for years
to acquire-a big acquaintance access to
influential people

   you have these ready to hand

   the boys would as you know boom
you along from the start the average
young lawyer has to learn lots about peo-
ple and piles of humans and all manner
of conditions of life and the qualities
billy that make a good reporter have
much in common with those from which
a successful lawyer is shapen

  as herrick ceased speaking leigh felt
vague promptings and desires to cut adrift
from the reportorial life herrick seemed
to have furnished the needed touch leigh
began to wonder that he had never recog-
nized his possibilities in the same distinct
fashion and on the same lines that his
companion had done a rush of convic-
tion came upon him

   old man said he holding out an
impulsive hand  ill do it ill do it i
promise you and thank you for this-
this advice

  herrick took the proffered hand and
held it looking at him searchinglv  i
think you will leigh he said at length
 and  think too that youll do it prop-
erly at that good night

       chapter iv
       meeting the enemy

teigh sat up late thinking planning
and-dreaming the acceptance of
the sentinels offer would more than


the railroad mans magazine

double the amount of his present income
if the district panned out even moderately
well

  with care-he was an orphan with no
one dependent upon him-he could save
all these added earnings which allied to
the sum that he already put by would at
the end of a year or so put him in posses-
sion of two or three thousand dollars

  having this money in hand he would
chuck the sentinel and attend evening
sessions of the martjnort law school re-
taining his position on the record how-
ever and doing his utmost in the mean-
time to increase and reenforce his friends
especially those who might be useful to
hun when he was admitted to the bar

  this last event he determined should
take place in about four years by that
time he would be thirty and while he
was building up his practise he would
have his nest-egg to rely on

  and mildred-she being miss vincent
-would surely wait for him so with this
last blessed conviction strong upon him
likewise the resolve to speak to mr bevins
in the morning leigh went to bed

  the proprietor of the record gave con-
sent to leigh more readily than the latter
had anticipated

   i think leigh said mr bevins
 that the record wont suffer by this and
so-go ahead and my boy im not going
to sermonize but id just like to remark
that the great majority of young men who
are otherwise sincere in their hunt for
success overlook the fact that honesty-
honesty of purpose of intention and ac-
tion-is just as tangible an asset as a
certified check

   heres a case in point im going to
let you do the sentinel work because i
know youre honest the sentinel job
will net you more per week than youre
getting here so you tell me there you
are i wont enlarge  the moral wish
you all kinds of good luck leigh but
dont overdo it you know if you begin
to feel the strain drop the work like a
hot potato

  leigh telephoned to staynes and two
nights later entered on his task of combi-
nation-breaking

  the meeting- place of the highburg
was a small room at the rear of the big
 reading-room  of the municipal hotel
once upon a time the reading-room was

the scene of nightly dances when the
hotel was known as  brannigans and
what were now the reporters quarters
then being the wine-room

   even highburg couldnt stand branni-
gans after a coupleof years or so of its
malodorous existence

   so the place changed hands and as the
 municipal was later  backed  by assem-
 blyman and local boss james p burke
 it became the semiofficial rendezvous of
 the majority of those politicians of the
 borough who were affiliated with the party
 to which burke gave allegiance

   it was a rather imposing-looking estab-
 lishment with mirrors mahogany and
 electric lights there were three floors
 over the cafe in the lower of which lived
 jjie manager of the hotel while those
 above were allegedly rented for pool-
 rooms

   access to the reporters room could be
 obtained either from a private hall that
 ran parallel with the cafe or through the
 reading-room but as the combine had a
 game of its own going-as staynes had
 said-the doors opening into both read-
 ing-room and hall were usually locked

   men brought news to the combination
at the same time that they brought thirsts
to the adjoining bar the quarters them-
selves were as scantily furnished as such
retreats usually are dusr litter and
furniture-creaky and disreputable-are
somehow or other the invariable accom-
paniments of the-sedentary phase of the
reportorial life there were seven totter-
ing desks that when in use had to be
coaxed into steadiness with slips of wood
and chunks of paper a dozen chairs of
all shapes sizes and stages of decay a
fire-alarm with clock register and gong 
a telephone and the inevitable files of
tattered newspapers

   leigh reached the place at about g
pm and rapped  the door leading from
the reading-room bronson of the call
replied by opening a peep-hole in the
door and surveying the visitor through it
the  peep  was a survival of the bran-
nigan days but was nevertheless found
useful in more ways than one by the
combine chiefly as an entrance and exit
for glasses

    hallo leigh said bronson then
he added with some touch of hesitancy
 will you come in
breaking the combine



  the other accepted the invitation and
plunged into a blue haze of tobacco
smoke four of the reporters were hard
at work at poker jimmie allen of the
clarion with his legs comfortably ele-
vated on a desk was puffing furiously at
his brier and reading snatches from a
sporting paper while griggs of the ex-
aminer his head resting on his desk
snored in staccato spasms

  leigh noting these things experienced
a hash of anger and disgust the delib-
erate disregard of duty made manifest by
the combine exasperated him

   well said leigh after some small
talk  im coming among you boys if
youll have me

   sure billy cried allen  glad to
hear it sentinel i suppose

   yes was the reply  side issues
though im still with the record
space asked ely of the super-
visor

  leigh nodded

  ely smiled  then i dont think this
will be a paying proposition

 why

   well youre to work in with the com-
bine i suppose queried ely evading
the reply direct

to be c

    if i can

  ely looked at him something in the
others tone was significant

    of course you can billy said allen
heartily youre just as welcome here
as if youd been born into the  push 

   allen was a huge bluff good-natured
fellow who was affiliated with the others
simply because he hated to be on un-
friendly terms with his fellows

   thanks jimmie said leigh  i
hope the others will second your resolu-
tion

  join us invited bronson as he
riffled the cards preparatory to a fresh
deal  yes sit in added halstead of
the free press pulling a chair over to the
table

    ill have to pass this timeboys re-
plied leigh  as im going to take a walk
round the district presently and make my-
self known to folks however ill watch
the game a bit

  bronson laughed and glanced wofully
at his scanty collection of chips  it
doesnt look as if i were prospering by
my phony work anyhow he said  im
trying to get back a bit of last weeks
salary that allen and ely got their hooks
on on tuesday

boiling the steam

before entering into a discussion of the
advantages resulting from the use of
superheated steam it is first necessary to
define it	

  superheated steam is nothing more nor
less than very hot steam it is steam of
a higher temperature than that which it
attains in the boiler in coming to boiler
pressure

 this higher temperature cannot be ob-
tained by adding heat to the boiler when the
steam is in contact with the water from
which it is made but the additional heat
will merely serve to make more steam

  if however the steam is separated from
the water and passed over very hot surfaces
it will receive additional heat and will then
become superheated this is what is done
in a locomotive the steam on its way to the
cylinders being made to pass through the
superheater apparatus in which the tempera-
ture is higher than that of the steam and in
which it thus receives additional heat

  what advantage is there in using this
very hot steam

  when steam enters a locomotive cylinder
it becomes cooled by coming in contact with
the cylinder walls and it becomes further
cooled by performing work in the cylinder
if the steam is of ordinary temperature a
large amount of it is turned into water be-
cause of this cooling process

  as this water has no power and does no
work all the steam from which it is made
is wasted furthermore this water in the
cylinders is dangerous because as we all
know if not released it causes broken cylin-
der-heads pistons bent piston rpds etc

  if superheated steam is used all the heat
that has been added to it may be given up
before it is cooled down to the point of be-
coming water by adding sufficient heat to
the steam therefore all the loss of power
which otherwise occurs can be prevented and
a great saving in coal and water is thus
effected
letters of an old railroad
man and his son

by herman da costa

no -a fifteen-million-dollar puzzle

jim being in a private earthquake of his own misplaces his
note-book but finds that the g m is
onto his job

jim to the old man

ear dad for -the last
month ive been attending
banquets and feasting like
a lord sounds queer for
a hard - working railroad
stenographer doesnt it
but bigbys been ill again and i had to
take his place

  at this time the annual inspection of
the road took place and so i had to go
along with t f again on his private
car all the big bugs on the road were
on board and i got so that i could look
the president in the face without wonder-
ing if he saw me vice-presidents were
as common as blossoms in spring any
one below that grade i hardly noticed

  of course you know how popular t
f is from one end of the line to the
other whenever we stopped at a town the

sries began id december  railroad

mayor usually came out with speeches
and a band and at night everybody at-
tended a big banquet t f made me
go along with him

  at the big cities there was usually
a delegation from the railway club on
hand and at night more speeches and
more banqueting t f made me go to
those also

  i have finally got so that i can tell
what the little fork with the long handle
at my place is for and whether i should
wait for the waiter to bring a new plate
or eat out of the old one the proudest
moment of all however was when the
superintendent of the momongah division
while i was at one of the banquets copied
everything i did i know he did because
several times i picked up the wrong
things and watched him out of the cor-
ner of my eye

  there has been just one thing thats

maai magatine single copies  ccati


letters of an old railroad man and his son 

bothered me at fhese banquets at the
opening they have a cocktail for the sec-
ond course theyve some kind of wine
for the third they have something else
to drink and right down the line it
goes that way at the finish they top
off with some more wine

a knotty problem

  now i dont drink-not because im
against it but because i never thought
about it everybody else drinks at these
banquets and i always feel a little silly
about acting the goody-goody boy by
passing up the drinks when they come
along

  the first night i did it i saw t f
grinning like an ape and i got red all-
over i knew at once what he thought
he thought i was trying to show off to
him that i was an upright virtuous young
lady so when the next banquet came
along i tackled the cocktail

   i know now why its called a cocktail
it tickled my throat so much that i had
a fit of coughing then t f grinned
more than ever fortunately the super-
intendent of the momongah division
wasnt there or id have lost caste but
i was determined to show t f that he
was mistaken so i drank everything that
came along

  just as we got down to the cigars an
earthquake shook the town i started
to jump up but nobody seemed to notice
it i said something to my next door
neighbor but it wasnt what i intended
to say i dont know what it was just
now the words got mixed up on the way
out luckily he wasnt listening to me

a private earthquake

  i shut my mouth then and held it
closed although i did long to open it and
say something not anything in particu-
lar just words when the earthquake
came the third time i knew right away
what had happened i guess you know
too dad

   i sat still and closed my eyes but there
was a canary swinging on its perch in-
side my head and it shook everything up
so that i didnt know whether i was
coining or going those fellows began
talking just then

  i was supposed to report the speeches
that canary kept on swinging however
and when i looked at my note-book next
morning the only thing i could read was
 gentlemen i threw it out of the win-
dow and told t f it had been mislaid

  when- the next banquet came- along i
balked at the drinks t f had been
watching me and i saw him grin again
so i got red again but i stuck it out
and the next morning when t f asked
me if i had again mislaid my book i
handed him the speeches written out

  then he grinned again and i got red
again one would think we were a couple
of lovers from the way we kept that up

  i let two more feeds pass up with-
out drinking but you know dad i have
always had a weakness for cherries so
when the next cocktail came i had to
have the cherry and the only way i could
get it was by drinking the cocktail
whereupon the same performance was re-
peated by t f and myself

when asked to drink

  the floor didnt rock that night
though although i did have a little head-
ache-no doubt the result of an earth-
quake in some other town but i fin-
ished my notes early in the morning
laid them on t fs desk and scooted
out of the car before he could ask me
about them

  seriously though dad this business of
drinking at a banquet is puzzling me
there are a lot of big men assembled
together and they always notice it if i
dont drink then the majority of them
try to get patronizing and that makes
me hot

  i can stand almost anything but a fel-
low who thinks you are i milksop and
treats you like it just because you dont
drink the way he does then when i
do drink there are some who think i am
trying to be fresh and i hate that almost
as much as the other

  i dont want to be a spoil-sport and
i have enough common sense to know
that too much drinking is going to hurt
a man i never formed any ideas on it
before because i never had thought of it

  i cant see how itd hurt me to drink
at a banquet and yet i can understand
that a good many people would think i


the railroad mans magazine

 turn out with flags and cannons and
 speeches and pink lemonade and pretty
 girls to welcome us as the only fine crowd
 who ever came down the pike

                 ive lost about ten pounds
               since i came here but i go
              to the y m c a gymna-
              sium regularly we have a
              big swimming pool there
              and almost every night when
              im not on the road i go
              in for a little while as
              soon as i get some pictures
              taken ill mail you one

             give miss pesnelle my
           regards and tell her you bet
           i like pumpkin-pie when
           i come home on my vacation
           next year im going to bring
           a silk muffler for her and a
           pipe for uncle hinckley

              i wrote mother yester-
            day  give her my love and
            dont forget to write soon
            affectionately jim

the

there are some who think i
am trying to be fresh

was a sport if i did it drink doesnt
hurt me at all i dont care much for it
and i know i can stop it when i like

  i dont want to say that ill never drink
for that would merely be stating that
i was afraid id become a drunkard
which would be simply cowardice on my
part t f and all these others may
drink and yet they dont become drunk-
ards and theyre widely respected

cheers and pink lemonade

  its one on me dad i dont know
exactly what i ought to do of course
i feel its better for me not to drink
but at the same time i dont want to be
known as a crank i have simply got to
be a mixer in this railroad business if
i want to become anything at all i know
t f doesnt look at it the way many
men do-think that because i take a drink
i am a booze fighter

  ive enjoyed our trips immensely of
course t f has been the attraction
everywhere we went but there is some-
thing mighty fine in having a whole town

to

old man
jim

  dear jim you must be
getting to be a mighty im-
portant person when you travel around in
private cars with the general manager a
good many men who have been with the
road ten to fifteen years cant say that
much one or two fellows i know right
now attach more importance to themselves
because they go out on trips with the g
m than because of the work they do
i dont reckon you will go that way
though

  when i read to your mother your
description of a banquet you attended
she held up her hands in surprise it
was the drink part that got her you
know shes a member of the w c t
u and i could see your finish the minute
i began reading it

  at last however she admitted that be-
ing as you were her son you wouldjill go
to the bad its queer about these wom-
en  they lay down the law for other wom-
ens sons fearin that they will go to the
dogs if they dont while their own sons
are always sproutin wings right behind
their shoulders and wearin a halo on
every day of the week

  while we are on the drink question i
letters of an old railroad man and his son 

  he had a son named tom and like
most fathers he thought tom was the
finest young fellow that ever trod shoe
leather the old man went up to new
york and for about six months had con-
fidential dickering with the president of
the little line that ran from new york
to trenton new jersey

  this little road was in pretty bad con-
dition and when the old man came up
for a dicker they were quite willing to
sell out to him-if he had the price

  it was a mighty big price for those
days-somethin like thirty million dol-
lars but the owners of it saw what old
barrett saw-that it would be a traffic-
maker equal in time to all the traffic
of the b and d the dickering was car-
ried on so secretly that not a soul got any
wind of it

  finally the old man got matters fixed
so that they agreed to let him have the
road for fifteen million cash and fifteen
million in stock they didnt close with
him however until they had gone to the
p f r and been turned down

the p f r was in good shape but
thirty millions was a very big sum and
they laughed when the new york road
told them that old man barrett was goin
to raise it  couldnt bluff them no
sirree the b and d didnt have thirty

want to tell you a little incident that
happened way back in the eighties ahou
twenty years after i went with the road
old john barrett was president of the
road then he had pulled it out of one
of the biggest holes it had ever been in
cleaned the rust off the engines borrowed
money enough to buy new rails and had
finally gotten it so that the dividends
were coming in regularly-

a road for sale

  the old man was one of those aggres-
sive deep - eyed fellows always livin
twenty years in the future the p f
r was a big competitor of the b and d
but the b and d had the right of way
the old man saw that new york was
goin to be the biggest traffic-producing
place in the country so he began to lay
his lines to push the road through to new
york then it stopped at baltimore

i could see your finish
the minute i began
reading it


the railroad mans magazine

millions to its name whats more they you get there and he will give you all
couldnt get it	the papers in exchange for this they are

                                         drawn up and waiting for you get your
           toms big task	hat and grip and start out right away

old man barrett sent for his son tom
one day tom was a fine-looking young
man and the old mans heart swelled
with pride as he stood before his desk

  tom said the old man  ive got
 a little work on hand for you to do do

when they saw the check for fifteen millions
they gasped

you reckon you can start for new york

 this noon  

 yes sir says tom

  i want you to go up there says the

old man call on jim bland of the n

y and n j and hand him this check

 for fifteen millions and this certificate for

stock in the b and d we have bought

 this road

 

toms eyes opened and his jaw fell
 gee whiz dad bought his road 
whered you get the money

the old man grinned  never mind
where i got the money son i got it all
right thats a certified check jim
blands directors will be in session when

a fateful stop

  it was the biggest job tom had ever
done in his life and when he swung on
board the train he felt as proud as punch
he got into philadelphia on time and
as he had about four hours
to wait for the new york
connection he went up to
the hotel to get a drink

  it was somethin he had
never told his father about
he drank like a fish at
times when he had put
his glass down on the bar
in strolled one of the p
f rs traffic men he
knew tom pretty well so
they had another drink
then tom treated him and
about that time in came
another p f r man from
the operating department
lie knew tom also so they
took another round of
drinks

   whatre you doing in
philadelphia tom asked
the traffic man

   no you dont said
tom  you cant pump
me youll be sick enough
about it to-morrow
though

   maybe hes goin to
buy philadelphia sug-
gested the operating man  looks like
hed like to buy the earth

  tom grinned  youre near it he
said  but not near enough he mo-
tioned to the bar-tender arid another
round of drinks came out the traffic
man winked at the operating man over
toms shoulder

pride of possession

  they had been out with tom before
and knew his failings tom was search-
ing in his pockets for change to pay for
the drinks when the operating man threw
out a ten dollar bill on the bar
letters of an old railroad man and his son 

   dont worry about money tom  he
said  borrow from me if you need it

   huh says tom  ive got more
money in that grip over there than you
ever saw in all your life

  been robbing a bank have you
says the traffic man

   nope answered tom  but were
goin to rob a railroad youll find out-
lay to-morrow all right all right he
reached for another drink

   the traffic man knew about the n y
road being in the market but he didnt
think for a moment that the b and d
was goin to buy it for curiositys sake
however and thinking that tom might
have some big traffic deal up his sleeve he
began to buy tom drinks pretty soon
the boy was just about able to walk by
holding on to chairs

   wherere you goin to stay to-night
tom asked the traffic man

   goin to new york says tom

   hes going to jump off the brooklyn
bridge  suggested the operating man

   you fellows can talk all you want
to says tom but to-morrow youre
goin to find that ive pretty nearly bought
new york

   oh stop your bluffing spoke the
operating man pretending he was dis-
gusted  you havent got money enough
to buy a house there

cat out of the bag

   i havent havent i   exclaimed
tom angrily  ive fifteen million dol-
lars right in that grip there

  the two men looked at each other then
laughed

   come on tom says the traffic man

 have another drink you dont know
what youre talking about

  tom was so full of whisky that be for-
got all his father had told him  so
you dont believe i have fifteen millions
eh he stammered well ill show-
you 

  he rushed over to his grip and with
some trouble managed to open it by this
time his two railroad friends were wildly

to be c c

 excited when they saw the certified
 check for fifteen millions with john bar-
 retts name scrawled across the bottom
 they gasped the traffic man realizing
 what it meant whispered to the operating
 man to make tom dead drunk and put
 jiim to bed then got away on some ex-
 cuse and rushed to headquarters

   inside of twenty minutes he had ex-
 plained matters to the president of the
 p f r and that gentleman sent out a
 hurry call for his directors in another
 twenty minutes they had a quorum and
 one hour after the meeting had taken
 place the p f r had been formally
 directed to purchase the n y and n j
 for twenty millions cash and ten millions
 in stock

euchred

   how they got the money nobody ever
 knew but it was whispered in phila-
 delphia that if there had been a run on
 half a dozen banks there they would
 have failed at eight oclock that night
 the b and ds option  the new york
 road expired and at nine oclock the
 directors of the new york road had sold
 their line to the p f r

   tom barrett was never heard from
 tigain they found out that inthe morn-
 ing when he heard the news he mailed
 the check and stock back to his father
 and took a ship to south america old
 john barrett died of a broken heart so
 the papers said

   this is actual history to-day the

 b	and d pays the p f r four hundred
 thousand dollars a year to run over their
 line into new york besides a percentage
 on all traffic hauled and the p f rs
 last report that i remember showed it
 was making six millions a year over the
 new york division

this is an extraordinary case i admit
but i always thought that if drink was
 going to make an ass of a man he might
as well quit it and there are lots of
men it does affect that way

    be a good boy and work like the deuce

your affectionate father

          he just kept the trombone snore turned on
          while the texan related this thrilling tale

he green conductor sat in the
old car that had been con-
verted into a lounge and
lunch room at the blue
point terminal tie lis-
tened to the stories of men
wearing numerous bands of gold braid on
their sleeves who spoke regretfully of the
old times and shook their heads over pres-
ent-day methods and administration

   goober  browne was telling of the
big loads that he carried down to coney
in the old days and  goobers  imagi-
nation was juggling with figures in a way
that would make a wall street tipster
green with envy when the new conductor
shifted his position and jerked an inter-
ruption into the ancients romance

   i carried a load in a hprse-car down
in texas once and it put your bi bunches
into shadowland for keeps he said
dreamily

   goober  swung a glance of wither-
ing contempt on the interrupter

  horse-car he snorted say
theres a guy of your breed running a pill-
box on wheels made out of trouser but-
tons over at hoboken 

  the new man joined in the ripple of
laughter while the indignant  goober 
folded his arms pulled his sunburnt cap
down over his eyes and gave other visible
signs to show that he had no further inter-
est in the past doings of the disputant

  what part of texas was that in
questioned a freckle-faced motorman who
was attempting to eat two crullers while
figuring on his run-card  i railroaded
down there

  not on the circuit i mean said the
green conductor  there were only two
men  that road from the time it opened
to the day it closed i was one of em



 and -he glanced for a moment at the
 rather plain face of the  mote - the
 other was nearly as handsome

   the motorman choked from the com-
 bined effects of cruller and indignation
 but the man from texas gave no heed to
 his muttering

   he industriously corraled the frag-
 ments of his own biscuit aviped his mouth
 with an expired transfer and leaning
 back calmly surveyed the group as
 tobey graham expressed it  he didnt
 look a very green man and the rail-
 roader who covers up his past with a ve-
 neer of verdancy is to be respected

    how many did you carry bo asked
 a gray-headed nickel-gatherer

    something between three and four
 hundred answered the greeny but as
 there were  fares collected  the trip
 i cant be sure of the exact figures all
 i know is that ive got the old guys rec-
 ords skewered down to the rear platform
 with the tombstone of little happenings
 piled on top of them

   a grunt of disgust came from the
 hunched-up figure of  goober  browne
 but the man from texas calmly turned
 up one end of the seat cushion converted
 it into a rest for his head and without
 further invitation started to tell his story

    it was down in a little hole called
 loopdog and some of the citizens of the
 place thought a lot of things like friendly
 feeling communal interests and civiliza-
 tion would be boomed hurriedly by run-
 ning a horse-car between that burg and
 a one - eared place called cactus camp
 about four miles away

    the cactus camp cluster wasnt the
 sort of place a tired hobo would want to
 connect with but the advance texas
 bug had got the loopdoggers on the get-
and goober browne slept



busy quarter and they advanced to meet
cactus with a horse-car on which i was
the junk-snatcher

   it wasnt a wealthy corporation that
loopdog and cactus camp transit com-
pany but they were sports they had
one car six horses and two employees
and they had more hopes than the penn-
sylvania railroad company i got the
conductors job because i was the only
man in the place who wasnt too tired to
walk after a nickel and the driver took
the steering occupation because his girl
lived half-way between the two camps
and no other job in the union could give
him the privilege of seeing her eight times
a day

   say you in the last-century overcoat
dont throw your crumbs  me 

   cactus camp was started by a saloon-
keeper he knew a litfle and so that
every one who visited the place would
have a good thirst when they arrived he
put his beer ranch on the top of the high-
est hill he could find and all the shacks
grew up in its shelter

   the hill was awkward for the l and

c	c transit company it wanted
horses with hind legs two feet longer than
the front ones to pull die truck up that
mountain and a team with opposite leg
measurements to drag it down again

  it made us take pity on the mules
on hot days when we had  passengers


the railroad mans magazine

for cactus wed wait at he bottom of the
slope till we were sure that there was a
return fare if he was a husky guy wed
entice him down the hill by telling him
one of the mules had the measles but if
it was a lady wed perform the ascent
the driver being in love was the most
chivalrous horse-steerer in texas

 we had been running the shay about
six weeks when a circus wandered up the

a look at the show and then drag the
headquarters mob back to their roosts

   goober  browne was snoring dis-
mally and when the texan stopped for a
moment to stare in his direction  goo-
ber  rushed the nasal music onto a top
note that was so shrill it seemed to sting
the silence like the crack of a whip

   it was a pretty ordinary circ con-
tinued the new man  but the last stunt

 mountain to cac-
 tus and we had a
 busy day pulling
 sportive loopdog-
 gers over to have a
 look at the outfit

   i remember
that day well it
was blazing hot
and when we got
over to cactus
round about seven
oclock in the eve-
ning we decided
to stay there have

jvfi

those who missed

on the program
stirred the mob
a fellow was
booked for an eve-
ning call on a lion
but the lion looked
as if he wasnt in
the humor to re-
ceive visitors

    he had tooth-
 ache or indigestion
 or something and
 when the guy saw
 the way in which
 the animal was do-
and goober browne slept	

 ing a carpet-beating act by banging his
 tail against his ribs he thought it advi-
 sable to postpone the visit

    that didnt suit the loopdoggers and
 cactus campites they cut loose all their
 cold-feet terms and sent them against the
 reputation of the lion-man and things got
 merry the mob reckoned the lion was
 a toothless arrangement who dated from
 the mastodon period they told him that
 they had doubts about it being a lion and
 the saloon-keeper offered to put up a hun-
 dred that his bulldog would worry it to the
 graveyard inside ten minutes the circus
 boss was a frenchman who couldnt swap
  compliments slung at him in plain ameri-
 canese so he turned out the lights and let
 us find our way out in the dark

    abig yellow moon was climbing up
out of the sand when we got to the om-
nibus and you could see the car rails 
stretching away to loopdog like a pair of
silver tongs we started off with about
thirty in the caboose every one of them
jabbering about the cowardice of the lion-
tamer  and i was just wading in to collect

didnt provide against continued the
texan  the circus tent had been
pitched a little way out of the burg and
all along the road in front of the car were
cactus camp folk and when they heard
the first yell and the
repeat edition of it
from the mob  the
car they took a big
interest in safe
places

 the horse jigger
came into demand
and if the circus boss
was after acrobats he
could have- gathered
in a few if he had
been on the trail of
the lion they didnt
wait for us to slow
down they took us
on the  loop and
those w h o missed
their footing did

their footing did not stay long in the du-

 the junk when a yell came from the cir-
 cus tent

    when i revolved my head i got a
fifteen-hundred-volt shock bout a hun-
dred yards behind us and streaking along
on five-point speed was the old toothachy
lion that had nearly caused the riot fley
you with the snore trombone  wake up 
im going to tell about that record load

    goober  kicked viciously at the boot
 of a motorman that disturbed his rest
 and turning hishead away from the story-
 teller put more vim into his snoring

    that lion started a boom in rapid
transit that the l and c c company
 r r

not stay too long
in the dust eith-
er

they gath-
ered themselves
out of the sand
and made for
the nearest tele-
graph-poles but
the lion took no
interest in their
movements he was attracted by the
rolling - stock of the company and the
fellows shinning up the bean-poles were
 use to him he just streamed after the
car and that love-sick driver let the mules
know that they were to beat lou dillons
record if they didnt wish to be the piece
de resistance for the lions supper

   when we got to the place where the
down grade began to be pretty noticeable
we had close on four hundred aboard that


the railroad mans magazine

car what they were three tier deep
on the roof the inside was fuller than a
coffee cup thats running over and the
human salvage that was hanging to the
platforms and cursing because the fellows
wouldnt give it room to roost on was
turning the main parade of cactus camp
into a dust-storin with its trailing foot-
gear

   coney shucks i know the coney
loads  why if i wanted the fares on that
run i couldnt have got one per cent
only the guys on the rim of the jam could
get at their pockets and they wouldnt let
go to put their hands into them for all the
transit companies between duluth and
galveston no sir

   coney these ancient guys that gal-
lop up and down one track for the whole
period between cradle and coffin think
their old route is the greatest passenger
drawcard in the union

   the lion had been gaining up to the
time we struck the slope butwhen we got
there he began to see he would have to do
the marathon of his life to make a con-
nection the fall was about one in five
and that car gobbled up the rails like the
twentieth century

    didnt we rub-a-dub-dub down that
mountain what the mules didnt
bother to gallop they skated  the mo-
ment they felt that the car was traveling
faster than they were they sat down on
their hindquarters and slid fact they
took a rail apiece and the weight of that
car behind them never gave them a chance
to slide off

  say that lion was no quitter the
mob in the car changed their opinions
about him going down that slope when
he saw us mopping up the iron he did a
honk-honk in the double bass and took
up the challenge it was the weight of
the crowd that kept that box on the rail
she bucked and rocked till half the mob
were seasick we went first on one wheel
a-  then on the other but the mules kept
in the lead they knew the kind of insect
that wanted to board us and they took no
chances

   four of the mob on the roof sub-
scribed a hand apiece toward the job of
keeping  nosey  peters with the outfit
while  nosey  unbuckled his gatling gun
on the pursuer but whether it was because
his nerves were out of gear or because

the old box was bucking too much the
shots didnt seem to trouble the king of
beasts

   he thought it a come-on signal and
he responded with another honk-honk in
the low bass to let us know he wasnt
skying the sponge all the time that load
was squirming and cussin and yelling fit
to beat the band they were standing on
each others toes and fingers and faces

  if it hadnt been moonlight that lion
could have trailed us anywhere by the
noise that came out of the caboose

   but didnt that car do the bucking
bronco act she capered and kicked and
lurched and rolled till we were fair stupid
from the tossing coney why all this
talk about the excitement of railroading
in thickly populated places makes me
tired ive listened to a score of yarns to-
day and im feeling as gay as a guy that
has toppled out of the empire state when
shes sprinting

   half-way down the hill i worked my
way through the car to see what the driver
thought of it besides i didnt like to be
the leading one in the deputation of wel-
come on the rear platform when the lion
would come aboard

   i told the driver he ought to write a
message to his girl on one of the run-
slips and paste it to the window or
some other part of the cap that the lion
wouldnt be likely to eat and he got
mad

     is he gaining  he gasped his face
white as a sheet

    hell lap us when we start to climb
that little rise at the bottom i answered

 hes got a burst of speed tucked away
for the finish and liell give us the hus-
tle act when the old box stops buck-
jumping

   he stooped down and whispered in
my ear and that fellows stock went up
twenty points in my estimation

    keep near me an be ready when i
give the word he said and you can bet a
bunch of transfers to a brass button that

i	waited they reckon a guy in love
hasnt got much spare time for anything
else but that mule-steerer wasnt thinking
of his girl at that moment

   when we struck the level at the bot-
tom of the hill every one saw that it was
twenty to one on the lion those mules
didnt have a hope of running away with
and goober browne slept

four hundred full-sized men aboard the
impetus that we got from the rush down
the mountain sent us at a good bat along
the level placeand rushed us a little way
up the slope but then the mules had to
tug in good earnest

   the lion started to overhaul us as if
we were standing still the mob on the
rear platform was debating about throw-
ing old pinto nicholls over the dash
so that we could gain a little time while
the lion was interviewing him when joe
the driver kicked me in the shins and we
gave the whole gang a scare

   both of us went over the front dash
together straddled a mule apiece and
before the crowd knew what we were up
to we had cut the traces and they were
running down hill to meet old woolly
head who was charging up the middle of
the track	

   say you ought to have heard the yell
that bunch set up when they found they
were going to meet him

   did they scream if that lion-tamer
had been there he would have been pleased
after the remarks they had made about
his pet a few minutes previous

   i was on for galloping right away
but joe pulled me up and there we wait-
ed in the middle of the track to see what
would happen

  and what did happen asked the
freckle-faced motorman

   why that little sclieme of the drivers
was only part of a big scheme that provi-
dence was working out to rescue the
bunch answered the texan when
the lion saw the car coming back to him
the old fool didnt have sense enough to
get out of the way but he sat in the mid-
dle of the track and made a grab at the
leg of a drunken loopdogger that was
hanging over the rear dash

   that was the lions last grab the
fender of the car smacked him hard in
the ribs and he went backward he tried
to get on his feet but the wheel got his
neck between it and the rail  the weight
of that four hundred soon did the rest

   when joe the driver saw how things
had panned out he grabbed me by the arm
and whispered into my ear  stand by
me lie said and then he galloped back to
the truck the crowd was swarming out
of it like bees and joe started to pull the
glory roll his way by telling them that he

planned the thing because he knew the
car would run backward and because he
knew the lion would stand in the middle
of the track and get run over that was
joes story

 but joe didnt sum up that bunch of
frightened guys they pulled the two of

and what did happen asked the
freckle-faced motorman

us off the mules and tlung us into a mud-
liole and took good care we didnt get
out till we were too tired to flounder any
more after that they took the car on to
loopdog and we set out to walk to the
nearest railway depot we had sense
enough to know that we wouldnt be wel-
come in either of those burgs after the
incident

moving a mountain

a two-million-ton hill is being
moved three miles in cincinnati and
dumped into an immense hollow which the
chicago cincinnati and louisville railroad
is filling for a road-bed into cincinnati from
chicago says popular mechanics to do
this work quickly huge panama canal dig-
gers are at work eating out the hill and
loading it onto pneumatic dumping trains of
seven cars each

  as fast as one of these trains is loaded
it hurries away to the dumping-grounds and
an empty train of cars takes its place

  as soon as the freshly-dumped earth is
left by the dumping trains along comes a
big spreader which saves the work of hun-
dreds of laborers it is pushed along by a
locomotive and plows through the soft earth
like a snow-plow and levels off the earth
even with the tracks when this is finished
a temporary siding track is laid upon the
newly finished embankment and in this way
the dumping cars keep moving close to the
edge of the hill

  so far about a half million cubic yards
of earth have been dumped into the bottoms

special traveling correspondent of the railroad mans magazine

these stories told by the boys of the espee form the concluding in-
stalment of a series that has brought more than its expected quota of
pleasure to the vast army of readers who look to the railroad mans
magazine for their literary divertisement this is the thirteenth consecutive
month of their appearance and in all that time we have never had a dissenting
voice as to their authenticity or interest

     in the final stage of his journey mr willets talked with the officers and
employees of all the far-west divisions of the espee clean around the gigantic
horseshoe that begins at salt lake and ogden and swings westward to port-
land and san francisco thence down the coast to los angeles thence east to
el paso a big territory to cover inorder to get some stories perhaps but
it was worth the trouble

    we will all say  good-by  with a tinge of sorrow to  riding the rail
from coast to oast but-

    look out for the new series by gilson willets

no -the boys of the espee

a cluster of first-hand yarns full of excitement which prove
why some men are heroes and
some are not

karry an espee operator at
  los angeles was playing his
  trick alone he was mad
  clean through barry could
  not raise beaumont eighty
  miles east on the pacific
  division this happened late one night
  in may 

  barry called up ontario and colton
and other places west of beaumont and
asked each operator in turn whether busi-
ness was doing with beaumont but each
answer came back  nothing doing

series began in match  railroad m

   had beaumont been cut off by a quake
of its own barr-y determined to find out
at any cost quakes were all the rage in
california just then although they had
not become the vogue in the southern
part of the golden state

   but maybe beaumonts got hers
right now barry said to himself  and
heres for getting news if i have to raise
that place via new york

   he didnt have to go quite so far east
however for he managed to get into com-
munication with beaumont via chicago

the railroad mans magazine

   a luny man is wiping us slowly but
surely off the map was the substance
of the last word received via some four
thousand miles of wire from the station
only eight miles away  and we are cut
off from all communication west

  details were given barry rushed to

batting out each switch-
 light and each safety-
 signal that he passed
 on his riotous way

  evening eastward toward beaumont but
then  one did see him and thats how
lie got the chance to begin proceedings
by batting out each switch-light and each
danger or safety-signal that he passed on
his riotous way one biff with the base-
ball bat and each such light or signal
was smashed into smithereens

this was the  luny man hancock
was his name he was from san fran-
cisco and his mind had been rent asunder
by his personal experiences after the
quake at the golden gate

luny is revenged

when he reached beaumont he batted
out the last switch-light just by the
roundhouse and then looked about for
other things to annihilate there was
the roundhouse standing before him like
a -monstrous helpless enemy
away with it and hancock
forthwith set fire to it

   flames rolled heavenward
and ignited two loaded box
cars and the adjacent tele-
graph-poles presently these
enemies of hancock were in
ashes

   the interior of the round-
 house was burned out the
 box cars were left with only
 their metal parts and the
 telegraph-wires in the vicin-
 ity were out of business
 thats why barry the espee
 operator at los angeles
 could not raise beaunioiit

  into beaumont toward
dawn rolled a special train
from los angeles bearing
a relief expedition and man-
acles for the wild-man who
was captuied and taken back
to los angeles

    but what gets us an espee man said
 when i came through there on the gold-
 en state limited  is the way that barry
 went up to chicago and thence got in
 on us with a flank movement from the
 east via el paso

    i believe barry would have persisted
 in his effort to get us even though lie
 had found it necessary to cable to lon-
 don and thence around the globe and

the despatcher and the despatcher went
still higher up and shortly a special
train sped out of los angeles bound for
the town that the luny man was threat-
ening with extinction

  what was happening down there at
beaumont

  in the first place a gentleman with
a baseball bat in his hand might have
been seen walking the ties early that
riding the rail from coast to coast	

 come at us iiy the back door that luny
 man cost e h harriman a whole lot
 of money but i guess he didnt weep 
 more than the lunatic did over the losses

mcdonald guessed right

    they told me the following at that sanu
 town beaumont the tragedy occurred
 on the morning of december  
 only a few days before my own train was
 held up there because of an accident to a
 freight in the yards

   the espee engineer who plays a part
 in this tale was dave mcdonald who
 lived in los angeles and was beloved
 of all railroaders on his division be-
 cause of his sociable ways

   a few days before the tragedy dave
 mcdonald met master mechanic kellogg
 and boiler foreman reichert and said

    i see you have given me number
  shes just out of the shops from
 repairs aint she  well i  reckon you
 think you are favorin me but i want
 to remark just the same that ive noticed
 that when boiler bustin time comes round
 its usually an engine fresh from a shop
 that gets the notoriety

    oh nonsense  answered kellogg
  boiler bustin is a thing of the past
 dave-at least it is on the espee

     youre just superstitious dave said
 reichert  and superstition is also a back
 number among espee boys

 on the morning of december  dave
 pulled into the yards at beaumont on
 the  and was ordered on a siding
 to let a train pass his was a long heavy
 freight but the mastodonic  didnt
 groan once under the weight when the
 time came to go back on the main dave
 -said to conductor guy brockman

    guy get up in the cab here with me
 -i want to talk with you some then
 to the head brakeman he said 

     williams you ride  the pilot -till
 we get away from these yards

four men were now aboard the engine

 -the fourth being fireman roy rey-
 nolds-when without warning there was
 a terrific explosion and the boiler went
 hurtling through the air it alighted on
 an oil-car then springing up again and
 falling  its head turned over on its back
 anil rolled a distance of  feet ahead
 of the engine

  twenty-five feet from the engine lay
the three men who had been in the cab
and the one who had been riding on the
pilot conductor brockman was dead
fireman reynolds was dead brakeman
williams was seriously injured and en-
gineer mcdonald was dying

  jack baile and other firemen and wi-
pers from the roundhouse knelt over
dave and heard him say

   if only the others are all right i
go content boys

   oh i guess they are all right said
daves friends

   because you see boys it was i who
insisted that brockman ride in the cab
and williams on the pilot tell em
good-by fori me and tell em i said-
shoot any man dead-who says-boiler
bustin is out of date-and superstition is
a back number

  such was the end of dave mcdonald
-beloved for his sociable ways

feeding the hungry

  now let me tell of a truly remark-
able stunt performed by the boys of the
espe commissary department at los
angeles in those terrible days immediate-
ly following the san francisco disaster
and they did it in the name of humanity
and without price

  those espee commissary boys down
there knew that thousands of persons
in san francisco had to be fed they
planned to help feed those people and
then they went to the powers for permis-
sion to carry out their plan

  the whole espee force at los angeles
took off its bridle to the commissary boys
and within forty-eight hours from the
time the germ idea got into the head of
baldwin commissary chief the biggest
rolling-kitchen known to railroad history
pulled out of los angeles bound for the
golden gate

   aint she the whole cheese and the
whole bakery exulted chief baldwin
as his dream rolled northward

  that train consisted of thirty cars all
turned into kitchens and bakeries one
hundred and twenty cooks and bakers
were busy therein making soups and stews
and coffee and bread from these thirty
cars the commissary boys fed more than
twenty-five thousand persons each day


the railroad mans magazine

which means that a total of some seven-
ty-five thousand meals a day were served
from that colossal mess-train

  and the espee boy who was the front
of the whole big stunt commissary chief
baldwin directed operations like a major-
general and set the pace for the boys to
an end that meant shelter and raiment as
well as food when the order came from
mr harriman to pay off all the boys in
san francisco at once so as to get half
a million dollars into immediate circu-
lation baldwin hurried to the head of the
line to get his pay in order that he might
all the sooner hand over half of it to the
relief committee

ate himself to death

  while telling of the espee eating de-
partment i must not forget those who are
the most useful while being the most or-
namental these espee boys are an in-
stitution in themselves and many a good
wife of an espee boy has come from their
ranks for these boys are the lunch-
counter girls at the stations

  the particular  counter girl  now in
my mind is mistress anne terry the one
with the pompadour of raven tresses in
the  restauraw  at the benson arizona
who told a tenderfoot about that man at
bisbee  feedin himself to death

   yes he ate himself into another

world he did said mistress anne  he
was bill rand that prospector thats been
coming round here as long as i can re-
member-and for thirty years more after
long prospects in the hills hereabouts mr
rand used to cbme into this lunch-room
and bolt more food at one settin than a
whole train-crew would consume in three
meals

 and that habit of his led to his mor-
tal end it wasnt ten days ago when he
showed up at the lunch counter at the el
paso and southwestern station at bisbee
where a nice mex girl friend of mine
tends counter she tells me that rand
had been lost for days in the hills and
that he staggered into bisbee about all in
and at starvation point

   it seems that rand didnt wait for
my mex girl friend to wait on him but
that he rushed up and seized a pie some
crullers a sandwich and a pot of beans
he bolted all of those things at once-
and fell off the stool dead he just ate
himself to death

getting a house moved

  the espee has its own uniformed spe-
cial police at midnight november 
 a policeman started out on a case
in plain clothes as such he is referred
to as  secret service but when he shows
up in uniform as he did on that novem-
ber night at redding california then he
is spoken of as  a policeman

  the man i write about is jim horgan
his is on the shasta division with two
hundred and seventy miles of mountain
track to police going wherever he is most
needed but having his headquarters at
dunsmuir the boss of the division is
superintendent whelan who issued the
orders that obliged jim horgan to get
into action at midnight

horgan was ordered to take a gang of

he just ate himself to death
riding the rail from coast to coast



thirty section-men and proceed to red-
ding the first important station south of
dunsmuir and there move a house bodily
from certain espee property into the
street-and get the whole job done before
daylight

  accordingly at three in the morning
a gang of thirty huskies under the leader-
ship of horgan dropped from a train at
redding station and made their way
across the track to the espee lot they
were armed with axes crowbars picks
and shovels and horgan was armed with
a club a badge and a whole lot of au-
thority

    sh  horgan warned his men  the
boy tom gilltnan is asleep within
dont wake him up move the house
noiselessly 

  and with that the section-men took
thirty whacks at that house making a
noise that would wake the dead shov-
els and picks cleared away the dirt from
the foundation axes cut away the sup-
porting beams and crowbars were the
levers that got action into the dwelling
at the rate of about a foot every half
minute

  meantime came wails from the interior
 what you doin to this house let me
out i say it was tom gillman who
had been placed on guard in the house
by its owner

horgan stands pat

  by five oclock the house stood in the
street  now build a fence clean round

  i wear a red sweater when
hunting so as to be sure that
none op our party will mis-
take me for a deer
 

the railroad mans magazine

this lot ordered horgan and the sec-
tion-raen put up a fence so quickly that
by six oclock horgan opened the front
door of the house called out tom gill-
inan and said to him

   now tom you go tell frank bucher
what weve done and tell him i say you
are a boy not shirkin your duty but

and his police when street superintend-
ent adams arrived

  take your house off my street or-
dered adams addressing mr bucher

    didnt put the house in the street
bucher replied  tell this railroad irfan
this horgan who put the house where it
is to put it back where he found it

the arms of the law let fly a fusillade of shots in his direction

guarding property as well as you know
how frank bucher was the owner
the land in question was in litigation

  by this time half a dozen uniformed
espee policemen had come down from
dunsmuir and these horgan now sta-
tioned at intervals along the fence givr
ing orders at the same time that the place
was to be thus policed till further notice

  at seven oclock mr bucher was on the
spot warring good and hard with horgan

  but just then up came fire chief
poole  i dont care whose house this is
or who put it where it isr he said  its
within the fire limits and its impedin
traffic and its got to go

   let it go  cried policeman horgan
gleefully  i dont care where it goes
so long as it goes away from here i
reckon me and my men have given this
town a white elephant all right but or-
ders is orders and superintendent whe-
riding the rail from coast to coast



lan cant say no grass grew under my
feet

made of the real stuff

  one of the predecessors of superin-
tendent whelan mentioned in the fore-
going story was j j lindberg who for
some years was division superintendent of
that same shasta division he was one
of the best-known railroad men  the
pacific coast and a personal friend of
julius kruttschnitt vice-president of the
espee

  mr lindberg worked so hard so fast
and so conscientiously at the task of ma-
king his division the best ever that he put
himself in a premature grave

  during the winter of - snow-
fell on the shasta division as it had not
fallen for years one storm after an-
other piled the snow up on the right of
way and all hands worked day and night
to keep the track open in january when
firings were at their worst on that moun-
tain division superintendent lindberg
announced that he would go out on the
line himself and direct the work

  for weeks mr lindberg was seen
along tliefline giving directions and lend-
ing a hand wherever needed thus encour-
aging the men by his own example of en-
durance and persistence when he fin-
ished clearing one section another would
become blocked with still another heavy
fall of snow it was hopeless work

  when vice-president kruttschnitt went
through there mr lindberg said to him
 i never knew before that snow was
like a flea just when i think ive got it
lashed to the mast it eludes me and falls
on the track up ahead or down below

   you better take a rest said mr
kruttschnitt  for you look all in

   not me replied mr lindberg  i
mean to keep this division clear of snow
if i have to shovel it off myself

  the next day the snow fighters found
their division superintendent lying help-
less on the battle-ground he had fallen
a prey to a paralytic stroke brought on
from exposure they took him to his
home in jjerkeley california and there
just before he dicd january  he
said to some of the officials of the espee
who called on him 

   thank god i was taken with my
boots on it isnt the approach of the

reaper that hurts its this confounded
inactivity while waiting the summons
that gets me a railroad man is a sol-
dier and the one who perishes on the
field of battle is to be envied

 smoke ups  gallantry

  the section that  smoke up  moores
bossed was some south of bakersfield
california one day in november 
 smoke up  might have been seen run-
ning at breakneck speed down the track
toward a train that was standing still
the train was standing at a place on his
section where trains are supposed to keep
moving and he wanted to know why

  before i proceed let me state that
 smoke-up  moores is renowned along
his section for gallantry emphatic and
persistent where ladies are concerned

  when  smoke up  reached the head
of the train he confronted some half
dozen young men and women unknown
to him and a train-crew whom he knew as
brothers

  even the ladies he ignored in the first
minute of his arrival while sweeping the
track with the trained eye of the born sec-
tion-man

   a broken rail eh and a rail twist-
ed out of shape at that eh well how-
ever am i to congratulate you -address-
ing the train-crew- on this narrow and
miraculous escape from sure death 

   weve got yonder gent to thank said
the engineer  i was poundin along as
usual when of a sudden i beholds this
gent standin in the middle of the track
wavin that red sweater which you now
see adornin the person of the ladv yon-
der

   yes hes roy gilchrist put in the
train conductor  hes a newspaper
man of bakersfield he with his party
here had been hunting he spies this
broken rail and at once he fairly tears
that red sweater from the ladys hack and
stops the train in the nick of time

  roy gilchrist here stepped forward
and introduced all hands to the lady who
wore the garment that had been the means
of saving life and property

   im very glad i happened to be wear-
ing this sweater said the fair lady sweet-
ly speaking in particular to  smoke up 
moores  i wear a red sweater wliva


the railroad mans magazine



hunting so as to make sure that none of
our party will mistake me for a deer and
shoot

  and now here was the main chance for
the gallant section-boss  mistake you
lady for a dear why miss whether in
red sweater or blue sweater or white
sweater i should at all times not make
any mistake in taking you for a dear

   here here smoke up old  smoke
up    cried the crew  light your pipe
and forget it

an indian did it

  there is harrow of the limited east
out-of los angeles who in november of
 ran down and captured a desperate
bandit-by proxy

  the limited just east of beaumont and
near banning was running fifty miles an
hour and considering the speed it seemed
impossible that a human being could
jump from the train and live yet while
harrow train was racing along at nearly
a mile a minute two limbs of the law
from kansas and i think also constable
de crevecouer of san berdoo shouted to
conductor harrow saying

  the prisoner has escaped - jumped
from this flying rocket 

  harrow proniptly backed the train
up some three-quarters of a mile to the
scene of the escape

  the arms of the law jumped from the
train while it was still in motion and
espied their prisoner in the act of strug-
gling to his feet that bold train-jumper
had been hurled eighty feet against a rock
embankment and now as he started on
a run the arms of the law let fly a fusil-
lade in his direction-but did not hit him

  northward the fugitive fled with the
officers after him and to conductor har-
row who was watching it seemed a dead
sure thing that he would make a clean
getaway

   ill get him though announced
harrow and he rushed through his
train till he came to a half-breed indian
named matthews famous in that region
as a runner  get after that runaway
henry said harrow to the indian  and
see that i dont have to hold this train
longer than-

  but before harrow could complete his
sentence the indian was on the trail

  he caught his man too and brought
him back to the train

   ive had to hold the train only forty-
five minutes for the whole job said har-
row  it sure does take a train conductor
to capture fleeting convicts im going to
suggest to headquarters that i be allowed
to carry that indian on all my trips be-
cause criminals that are being taken from
california back east are almost sure to
make a break for liberty  that indian
would earn his keep ten times over by
saving the road expensive train delays
caused by officers that cant shoot or run
station - agent jeroloman at duns-
muir arrived at his station early one
morning in august  in time for the
coming of the south-bound from port-
land the train pulled out leaving a
young woman weeping and in dire dis-
tress

an inexpensive honeymoon

   ive lost my hand-bag she wailed
 and my jewels-and our money-and
my husband

  your husband ejaculated jerolo-
man

   yes sir he jumped out of the car-
window after my hand-bag it contained
my diamonds and our cash

   where was that jump 

   on what you call your siskiyou
grade

   that means train was going up-and
slowly i reckon your husband lady
werent hurt much

  an hour later sure enough the hus-
band arrived at dunsmuir footsore and
weary after walking the ties for miles

   i found everything all right he an-
nounced displaying a bag and a lot of
jeweled baubles and a roll that looked like
a bundle of smyrna rugs

   you see he explained  were re-
turning from our honeymoon and my
wife dropped this bag out of the window
of the pullman some time before day-
light and i dressed and jumped out of
the window-and here i am

   and do you mean to say expostu-
lated the agent  that you are actually re-
turning from a honeymoon with a roll
like that well you sure do deserve to
lose it

roadmaster samuels and a number of
riding the rail from coast to coast



section-hands were inspecting track on
san gorgonio pass one of the steepest
grades on the los angeles-tucson divi-
sion of the espee where trains rush down
toward the desert at speed terrific they
came to a trestle samuels said 

   i smell smoke dont you boys 
  on examination they found a pile of

  if we dont get this bridge well get
 the second or third one

  a threat  exclaimed samuels and
 he sped away and notified the authorities

 the result was that some hours later
 constable de crevecouer came into san
 berdoo with two youthful prisoners

  these prisoners he said  are char-

y  he jumped out of the car-
window after my hand-bag

brush under the trestle burning and
threatening to set fire to the structure

  roadmaster samuels and his men were
in the nick of time and by their watchful-
ness the east-bound limited that morning
was saved from terrible disaster

   and whats this  said samuels in-
dicating some writing in the sand under
the trestle the writing stated 

lie reatz and abe parker who were
thrown off the sunset express by a
brakeman perhaps they thought to
get square with the railroad men for
serving them like that when they were
attempting to beat their way per-
haps they tried to burn that trestle
and perhaps they wrote that letter on
the sands but the espee trains are
safe from these fellows now and
he locked his prisoners in the cala-
boose

  two days after the foregoing events
brakeman ratigan was performing his
duties on a very long and heavy east-
bound freight as they rolled down the
san gorgonio pass ratigan said to sam
hayes a fellow brakeman 

   they couldnt find enough evidence
that those two kids tried to set fire to the
trestle the other day so they held them on
the gauzy charge of vagrancy


the railroad mans magazine

the trunk was tied up with yards and yards of cord

   well so long as they hold them on
any old charge replied hayes  i reckon
things will run smoother and more com-
fortable on this grade

  he had hardly spoken when the train
struck an obstruction half the cars were
jammed with terrific force and nine oil-
cars lay ditched ratigan unhurt saw
his friend hayes flung to instant death

  the shock affected ratigan seriously
and when he got back to los angeles the
next day he laid ott

   seein hayes go like that has locoed
me said ratigan he was suffering
from a high fever and wasnt just sure of
what he was doing or saying that night
he was wandering round the streets acting
in an erratic manner he stepped into a
drug-store and asked the proprietor to

telephone for a hack
saying that he couldnt
walk another step

  that druggist had
been held up by foot-
pads only a few nights
before and he was sus-
picious of the stranger
who acted so queerly
so the druggist prompt-
ly called a policeman
and made him arrest
ratigan as a  suspect-
ed highwayman

  the patrolman took
ratigan to the police
station where a sur-
geon examined him
his temperature was
 and his pulse 

   i aint a highway-
man no moren you
are said ratigan in a
weak voice

   thats dead right
said the police surgeon
 youre a sick man
you are whats your
trade

   my trade said
ratigan  is that of
watchin brakemen get
killed and thentrvin
to figger up how it is
that the police here-
abouts hold kid train-
wreckers on the mere
charge of vagrancy
while they hold innocent-brakemen on the
charge of being highwaymen

  to the police it was evident that rati-
gan had reached the raving stage in his
fever  but say honest captain rati-
gan went on  what beats me is how did
those kids do the trick they being in jail
at the time as vagrants 

  such was the tragedy growing out of
the fact that a sunset express brakeman
threw two young men off his train

jack middaughs death

  when a fireman in the very act of
shoveling coal into his fire-box is mor-
tally hurt through a hazard that has noth-
ing at all to do with the railroad few
will believe it such in fact was the ex-
riding the rail from coast to coast



perience of fireman jack middaugh of
the espees nevada division

  middaughs division was that one that
begins at reno with the shops and yards
hard by in sparks it is in sparks that
the boss of the division superintendent
manson has his headquarters and it is
in sparks that the  boys  are proud of
their southern pacific library associa-
tion where they have a building that is
equipped with bath-tubs as well as books
and magazines

  on a december evening in  at
six oclock fireman middaugh and engi-
neer christensen started from reno
where they had been doing switching
work all day to take their switch-engine
to the roundhouse at sparks on the way
middaugh said

   soons we get there christensen im
going to get one of those bang-up baths
for which we pay fifty cents a month

  like a stone fireman middaugh
dropped to the floor of the cab he was
stooping over in front of his fire - box
when he collapsed

   he lay on the floor of the cab bleeding

  christensen was terribly frightened
he put on all speed for sparks when
he arrived there he was reminded that
reno not sparks was the place for his
wounded comrade because the nurses
hospital was located in reno

  so back to reno christensen hustled
his engine and poor middaugh was car-
ried off to the hospital

rubbing it in

  until this time engineer christensen
had spoken scarcely a word but now he
said

   whatever has happened to middaugh
anyway we didnt hit nothing we
werent wrecked a little bit there was
no collision nor ditching nor derailing nor
running off track from a broken rail nor
boiler explosion nor nothing atall so
what i want to know is why did mid-
daugh cave in and go to bleeding like he
did

   hes shot said one of the boys
 the bullet hit-him in the shoulder and
ranged down through his left lung the
wound is mortal

   shot  cried christensen  show

the

me the man that did the shooting and
ill- as if we hadnt enough dangers as
it is without adding to them

   it werent a man it were a boy with
a rifle careless handling you were just
passing state park when the shot took
middaugh some boys were playing with
firearms and in the fortunes of war mid-
daugh was struck down

   well all ive got to opine is said
christensen  that on top of all the other
things we risk this is certainly rubbing
it in

shingles hypnotic power

  baggageman shingle at berkeley cal-
ifornia is a firm believer in the power of
hypnotism or auto-suggestion and noth-
ing can shake his faith therein

  one day a young woman a nurse
alighted at shingles station shingle
took the ladys trunk-check and found her
trunk for her the trunk was tied up
with yards and yards of cord

   youve got enough cord on that
trunk said shingle innocently enough
 to hang yourself with

  only a few days after that a doctor
from the nurses training-school came
down to the station and said to shingle

   did you hear that weve had a suicide
at the training-school  one of the nurses
hung herself with a trunk cord

   was she light complexioned   asked
shingle excitedly  with plenty of gold
fillin tucked away in her front teeth and
a whole lot of molars showin when she
laughed  

   yes thats the one her name was
ethel buttimer

   it was was it well doc say do
you believe in this here hypnotism at long-
distance range this here auto-sugges-
tion  

  yes why

   oh nothing at all - except to say
doc that this here auto-suggestion busi-
ness is downright dangerous i never
thought an ordinary baggage-smash could
have that much influence with a female
well if that dont beat all

  and he told the doctor of the remark
he made to the young nurse about her
trunk cord-and shingle has been telling
that story at least once a day ever since

nutley the stickler

by robert fulkerson hoffman

            a plausible but defective theory
            fares badly in the final proving

es a stickler for points

    he will put in twen-
   tyeight straight minutes
   saying nothing in par-
   ticular and whetting the
   edge of his wrangle knife
   on the bootleg of his bullheadedness-eh

    yes he will and then hop in and grab
the last two minutes of a half-hours
friendly chat and skin them alive while
he splits an imaginary hair on air imagi-
nary mole on the face of somebody elses
opinion but i like him

   oh you dont have to laugh  an-
nounced startzel in conclusion as a
stifled and uncertain sound came from the
direction of the big leather couch in the
far corner  that was no joke that i
shoved off onto your mental platform
that is information properly sorted tied
and routed

  he shook himself out of the depths
and tatters of a once luxuriously uphol-
stered lounging ciiair by the window and
drew the shade against the city lights
that were momentarily springing up more
numerously in the early darkness he
closed and set aside the dummy distribu-
ting case into the diminutive pigeon-
holes of which during most of the after-
noon he had silently and patiently
thrown one by one the name cards of a
new and complicated route

  in this first hour of the evening he
had been sitting almost under the frown-
ing overhang of a grand and gloomy
marble mantel that mutely told of the
neighborhoods departed social greatness
wrhile he quite audibly told his room-
mate what he thought of the meritsof
some recently designed safety appliances
for mail-cars

finally he had busied himself at



leisurely gathering from his possessions
what was needed for use on his night-mail
run and started toward the door

    no dont strain yourself wally he
counseled complacently while ambling
across the room

    i know  disinal  nutley and if-
startzel broke off abruptly as he
reached the door of the kansas city
boarding-house room which he shared
with wally of the persimmon routes
car department lie was first of all a
methodical man and having fixed upon
an idea or practise startzel followed it
almost automatically

  this simple fact was destined to tip
the wavering balance between life and
quick destruction for him before the
coining midnight hour should strike but
just now he had merely discovered that
his crumpled gray hat was on his head
wrong end to

  he set his little battered gripsack
carefully on the floor while he made the
desired reversal then picking up the
gripsack and standing with his free hand
upon the door-knob he completed his in
terrupted farewell

    if you can get that great truth right-
ly into the midst of your understanding
wally it will save you having a whole
bunch of jolts while you work this busi-
ness out with nutley

    nutleys a good inspector and i like
him in a way but hes a stickler for
points and hell give you the fantods
if you dont watch out i had em when
he first came on our route

   you keep right on voting for the
hand-rails will you

    gby 

  startzel may have  had em as a
result of his wearing experience with the

tip your car he

suddenly broke in

  in the following customary minute of
hoping for the best and fearing the worst
he passed with others aboard the car
safely down the foolhardy grade and
sweeping around within the wide curve
of the covered station-shed was presently
swallowed up among the trim lines of
outgoing passenger and mail trains in
the complex orderly confusion of the
union station

  meanwhile wally wise in the annals
of car lore of the persimmon route had
yawned and turned with increasing com-
fort upon the broad and ancient leather-
covered couch where startzel had left
him he reached out lazily and aimless-
ly once or twice before he succeeded in
fixing his burned-out pipe satisfactorily
upon the chair at his side he closed
his eyes determined upon a nap that
should be free of all care and cars

  just when he had reached the border-
land wherein carking care rides prisoner
in the distant roads to peace startzels
lurid sketch of  dismal  nutley grew
before wallys drowsing mental eye un- 
til in a clearing instant he saw nutley
in the graphic pantomime of startzels
making

governments inspector in charge of safe-
ty devices but he appeared none the
worse for it as he swung his broad
shoulders along under the street-lamps
and reaching the brow of the high bluff
stood looking down upon the wide cluster
of gay-seeming colored railroad-yard
lights far below him in the midst of the
citys yellow night-glow

  there was in startzel a certain fine-
ness of sentiment that bade him always
to allow himself this mute farewell of
the city before entering upon the perils
of a night-mail run through missouri-
the same lovable quality of mind that
appears to the chance observer only in
little surface gleams in the swift-moving
life of almost every man who has the
mental and physical strength to survive
in the railway mail service

  so startzel stood looking down into
the night dreaming his dream whatever
it may have been only for a moment be-
fore stepping aboard a passing street-car
that was heading for die giddy descent
to the yards


the railroad mans magazine

  that ended the nap but half begun
he snorted laughed helplessly for a mo-
ment and was wide-awake

   guess im feeling too well to sleep
he confided smilingly to his pipe as he
sat up and refilled it  well take an-
other look at the drawings

  shortly he was seated with blue-prints
spread upon the table under the light of
one lonely gas - jet burning above the
ghostly mantel there came a rap at the
door and he turned the prints face down-
ward upon the table before bidding the
caller enter

  oh you nutley he said in sur-
prise as the door swung inward to ad-
mit the inspector  thought it was one
of the boys along the hall i should
have opened for you have a seat 

  no-no i think not thank you
hardly have the time

   i was intending to go down to the
train with stsrtzel i wanted some fur-
ther expression from him on the new safe-
ty hangers he has strong opinions and
a good deal of insight

   has he gone 

   he has replied wally briefly cov-
ering both question and comment

   you should have been here a few
minutes earlier he added with difficulty
preventing his smile of genuine welcome
from degenerating into unrestrained
laughter

   startzel goes to the train earlier on
monday night because of heavier assort-
ment at the start

   going on the run with him to-night
the car is all fitted up for trial you
know

   yes i intended to and must be go-
ing replied nutley

  jplenty of time said wally consult-
ing his watch sit down and have an-
other look at the drawings while you
are here

   theres a point or two-

  nutley sat down and in a moment
wally was deep in the discussion of the
respective merits of hand-rails bracketed
the full length of the car at the base
of the clearstory transoms and of short
pendant iron rods hung vertically at in-
tervals from free swivel joints fastened
in the top of the hood so that men might
leap from their working positions and
hang to the hand-rails or the rods free

of the floor and its encumbrances when
extreme need arose

  the plain question was this

  in the brief time that is given a mail
clerk after he knows trouble is close at
hand which could he reach and grasp
most surely-which most quickly-the
long fixed hand-rails above and to the
sides or the dangling rods which were
free to follow any angle of the cars ca-
reening and almost within his reach di-
rectly over the central aisle

  each device had its claim to excellence
but only one could be had somebody had
fixed upon a cost limit and somebody else
had agreed

  one must be chosen

  wally was for the hand-rails and he
marshaled his arguments skilfully while
nutley listened-and  whetted the edge
of his wrangle knife

  the swiveled rod was a pet idea of
nutleys adoption it seemed to hold
him with a sort of fascination like that
which a clawing kitten finds in the pur-
suit of an apple hung upon a string

   tip your car  tip your car   he
suddenly broke in upon wallys discourse

  of what use are the fixed hand-rails
when you tip your car in a wreck

   where would a mans feet be

   where would his head be

   how would he get over there in time
anyway 

   but here look at the swiveled rods
central over the car aisle always with-
in reach but never in the way

   always pointing downward no mat-
ter at what angle the car may be canted
always reaching down a helping hand
to the man below 

   all he needs to do is reach up and
leap for it it is a godsend to the serv-
ice wally and i think you should cast
your vote with your people for its use
upon the persimmon

   as matters stand their report to the
government will weigh against mine we
should not show up in a deadlock of that
kind

   we will try this car out to-night and
further it is true but lacking an actual
proof it will still remain a matter of
opinion

  if we could have a proof of the
actual result in practise i have no doubt
what it would be
nutley the stickler



  nutley had grown fervid enthusiastic
even regretful as he proceeded not quite
realizing at the moment what the desired
proof might cost that it could be had in
nothing short of splintering and crushing
wreck

  before the fixed leaving-time he had
arrived at the union station inspected
the safety hangers and was seated out of
the way in startzels mail-car

  startzel had grasped the last sack of
mondays heavy mail unlocked it and
was shaking out its gorge of mail upon
the broad wooden tray before him in-
stinctively and from long habit he and
the others within the car were listening
subconsciously while they worked be-
tween trays and cases to the sharp clang
of hammers upon the wheels of the train

  the wheel-tonkers made their way slow-
ly from the rear testing and inspecting at
either side and the brief bell-like clang-
ing came close under the mail-car and
passed on toward the front of it

  at the forward wheel on startzels side
the hammer rang dully upon the flange
startzel instantly straightened from his
distributing and with his hands filled
with mail stood listening intently

  the man below searched the flange with
his torch and struck again harder the
wheel rang a fuller note not quite true
and clear but yet not the dead flat note
that would tell uncompromisingly of a
bad fracture

  once more the man searched and struck
getting a fairly vibrant sound he called
to his mate who stood listening on the
opposite side of the car

   what do you say to that joe 

   stopped on a clot of sand maybe
came the answer  dont see anything
do vou 

  no

   thats good shes all right get a
move on you  well remember her when
she comes back on wednesday

  they passed on toward the front and a
little later hays on the big engine of the
mail was whirling it out through the
night over thp red clay banks and down
among the swelling buttes looming big
and spectral upon the fringe of the head-
lights wavering bar of light

  nutley meanwhile- sat watching the
furious battle with the deluge of mail that
fell in upon startzel and his mates at

every big station and rained upon them
in an intermittent stream from the mail
cranes which gave up their shadowy bur-
dens along the more open places

  he noted with some surprise the extent
of the circles in which the rod swung
irregularly while the car dipped and ca-
re eited

  instinctively his eyes went in turn to
the stanch hand - rails stretching away
along the lower edges of the clearstory

  while he sat thus debating the matter
in his mind hays on the engine blew
the long signals for the approach to the
bridge over big babbler river and the
train swung sharply into the long curve
that ends just short of the bridge

  down under the forward end of the car
there came a sharp spang of metal broken
at high tension the sound was lost in
the roll and rumble of the flying train and
in the light grinding of the brakes with
which hays was steadying her upon the
curve

  the flange that had rung false in kan-
sas city and then again and again had
seemed to ring safely true had broken
free from the tread of the wheel and for
a hazardous moment or two it was swept
along with the axle rolling and clashing
beside the wheel then it caught and
was crushed and broken into irregular seg-
ments and nutley received his proof

  a hurtling tumbling piece of the steel
fell and hooked upon the rail in front of
the rolling rimless tread the wheel
leaped instantly and the truck followed
there came a grinding and splintering
crash from beloav and then the scene that
every mail clerk pictures only in his darker
hours was enacted to the full

  at the first jolt and crash from the
truck startzel leaped upward scattering
his handfuls of mail wide upon the car
floor his alert methodical mind had in-
stantly connected and put a right value
upon four things

  the dull stroke of the hammer at kan-
sas city the whistle signal for big bab-
bler curve the crash from below and the
hand-rails above him

  with instantaneous reasoning he backed
his belief with his life and chose the hand-
rail his fellow workers hesitated only
for a glance then followed startzels lead

  not a word was spoken not a cry
was uttered they were veterans facing


the railroad mans magazine

the death that they had been wordlessly
trained to meet

  the splintered car floor gave upward
before the thrust of broken car-sills that
broke above the battering of the leaping
truck the truck up-ended reared and
plunged in the midst of the flying debris

  heavy laden wooden trays filled with
loose mail shot forward upon their slen-
der iron racks shearing and crushing all
that stood between

  towering piles of loaded mail-sacks
fell crushingly over all and many-holed

  they found nutley there when the
ruck of it was being straightened out of
the ditch very small and white he looked
pinned spitted through and through be-
tween the interlocked and jagged ends of
the broken car-sills with his hands pin-
ioned together high above his head and
the safety - rod swaying and dangling
mockingly to one side just a little higher
than his stiffened finger-tips

  poor nutley it was the proof

  that was a terrible  proof said
wally sadly when startzel was again sit-

cases were torn from their wall fastenings
and hurled their contents upon the ruin

  all this in the draft of a breath and
when the commotion had made itself felt
in the engine and the brakes bore down
harder upon the wheels the vagrant truck
was making its final writhing upward
turn under the plowing and leaning car

  the gaslights burned steadily on
through it all and startzel hanging by
his hands from the hand-rail with his feet
drawn safely above the shearing and
crushing mass below saw nutley rise and
spring wildly clutching at the swaying
rod above his head-saw it swing abrupt-
ly beyond his straining reach and saw him
fall back into the massive wreck of things
heaving and splintering below him

ting in the frayed lounging chair by the
window and wally was idling the evening
hour upon the leather-covered couch in
the far corner

   yes poor nutley  said startzel

   i liked nutley he was a good in-
spector even if he was a st-

  it caught in startzels throat - just
there-and he finished by drawing the
shade against the city lights which were
again showing numerously in the dark-
ness and by lighting the lone gas - jet
above the once grand marble mantel

   yes said wally very gravely  poor
nutley 

  then he reached aimlessly once or twice
before he recovered his neglected pipe
from the chair that stood close beside him

startzel saw nutley rise and spring wildly clutching at the swaying rod
told in the smoker

the american drummer what would the smoker be without him his
cheery face his glad hand his never-ending string of stories-they are
as much a part of our great railway systems as the rolling-stock he
travels over miles of country spreading the latest wares of commerce the
pullman is his home his friends are legion and live in every city town and
hamlet

    here is a bunch of the latest drummer yarns that we have collected if
any drummer who reads them can send us in any that are as good we will
gladly print them wewill publish told in the smoker from time to
time-whenever we have a sufficient number of good stories if the knights
of the grip come to our aid it should appear regularly

the most humorous of the latest yarns of that cheerful traveler
and indefatigable produce pusher-the
american drummer

e round merry face of jl
fisher pushed into the smo-
king - compartment as the
train pulled out from roch-
ester going east and found
what it was looking for-
good company the smoker was already
crowded and the round sleek figure of
j l f seemed to be pushing all the other
occupants against the walls but some-
how a seat was found for him there is
always a seat for him anywhere for lie
has a story to tell

  by occupation j l f takes out a line
of samples of what the chicago milliners
think will go best in the way of trimmed
and untrimmed hats and sells them up
and down the land  but by preference he
seeks out his brothers of the grip and re-

gales them with the latest twist he has
been able to see in something that just-
happened to him

  on this occasion he fell in with a good
crowd coming home off the road for the
holidays and making the lat jump into
new york most of them had swung
around the continent hitting big towns
sleeping twenty-nine out of thirty nights
on the move

   say i got such a cold i can hardly
talk fisher began before he dropped
his satchel  but hear this from buffalo
you know the way the street fakers get
the gawks piling around them down by
the union station one of them had a
bunch of longshoremen from the lake-
front standing shivering in a zero zephyr
last night while he told them all about


the railroad mans magazine

greens medicated cough-drops he said
it could wrestle a cold and get both shoul
ders to the mat in one throw but his own
voice was worse than mine is now he
was just whispering and tearing his throat
all to pieces to reach the fringe of the
crowd

   it was his voice that got me you
know i used to do a little of that myself
and i watched to see his game

cured his own throat

    makes no difference if youre so
hoarse you cant hear yourself whisper
he croaked like a man with a harelip
trying to shout  just slip one down
easy and itll clear your throat in ten
seconds its the greatest remedy ever
discovered for the cause of suffering-

   he couldnt get any farther and be-
gan to cough as if he were going to lose a
lung

    say some one called out  why
dont you try it yourself 

    thanks friend he croaked back 
 thats a good idea

   then as the crowd stopped gaping
and shivering he took one of the cough-
drops looked relieved and began to talk
in his natural voice

    funny but here i am selling these
priceless cough-drops at a quarter a bot-
tle and i havent got enough sense to try
one myself

   they all bit anything goes on a
crowd but im not the fellow to laugh
at them i thought i had something
smooth myself once but it turned out raw
there is a joke in what i just said-you
may catch it by and by i went broke in
scranton and got on the tail end of a
wagon with a gross of little beauty safe-
ty razors

   the streets were full of miners and
all you had to do was to show them some-
thing and they had their dollars ready
before they knew if they wanted it

    come on up  i called out  ill
shave any man in the crowd and ill give
a dollar to every one i cut 

   they came up trusting as calves and
before i got through with the first one
they were packed around so thick that the
driver didnt have to worry about his
horse so he came back and wanted to
take a hand

   he said hed been in the army and
knew all about shaving i tried to keep
him off but hed put up the money for
the razors and was feeling toplofty

   before he broke in i had shaved ten
slick and clean and they were pushing
in closer yammering to give up a dollar
per

   i was figuring on what i could do
with the hundred dollars  could almost
see in my hand but i wanted to wait un-
til some fellow insisted on buying right
away and then it would be a regular stam-
pede but all the time there was a little
miner down in front trying to get me
to shave a chin covered thick with steel
wires

   i knew the little beauty couldnt
stand up against it and every time he
tried to catch my eye i was busy picking
out fellows with easy whiskers

   finally i had to move to the other
end of the tailpiece to get away from
him without attracting notice and while
i was giving a practical demonstration
over there he got hold of my driver and
financial backer and first thing i knew
they were at it

   it was all off right then his whis-
kers wouldnt cut and couldnt be nicked
off they had to be pulled out by the
roots and my partner did that all right
everywhere lie went on that doormat he
left blood

   my demonstration wouldnt take at
all they were all watching that bleed-
ing face it was no use i just jumped
off the tailpiece and left the razors to the
driver they were his anyway and it
was his fault

   wait till i get my drinking-cup i
want to wet my throat

measuring the sheet

   heres one said bob lahrn who
specializes on suits and overcoats  what
is the matter with this one by the ice-
water youre getting particular hav-
ing your own drinking-cup

   thought i was in kansas or wher-
ever it is where they have the law against
drinking-cups take your own little cup
when you go out there none furnished
anywhere and no one will lend you his
unless youre a pretty girl

 all the wise boys have little folding-
told in the smoker



cups handy no use for them as far as
their own thirst is concerned but when-
ever a pretty girl walks to the end of the
car they strain their ears to hear her say
 oh dear i forgot my cup  then up
they jump each with his little cup in
hand and trample on each other in the
aisle to get there first you know how it
is in day-coaches-how the old travelers
always go for the middle of the car where
the-riding is easiest now you find them
all over the trucks near the water-coolers

   theyve got another law somewheres
that sheets must be nine feet long some
of the trains that pass through the state
had to have new sets of linen for the
sleepers the first night they outfitted
the kitty flier out of st louis the por-
ter in my car was measuring to see if they
hadnt forgot an inch or two he was
holding up a sheet by one end with the
other end trailing for a couple of feet
when all at once it began to rise until
the lower hem was just touching the
floor

   i could see his fingers at the top but
i knew he was not standing on the seat
the sheet was between us though and i
could not make out how he was able to
reach so high

  whos levitating you i asked

    whas dat

    how can you reach so high 

    ahs standin on mah toes 

  fisher stopped to take the drink lahm
offered him but he went right on as soon
as he had gulped it down

a bath and a brush

  too clean for me he said ive
been down in the mississippi valley for a
month and im not used to this bleached
water i like mine brunette you know
how dirty the water is down that way
the worst ive seen was in nashville
theyre proud of it there you know
they say you need the grit in your crop
if you go so far as to drink it but wash-
ing is where it shines you makes you
clean without soap just rub the water
on the skin and the sand takes off the
dirt they dont like to have you get
funny about it in your remarks

   while i was there sol metzger with
a line of leather goods came along and
signed up for three-fifty a day american

plan bath thrown in sol went up-stairs
td get all he could for his three-filty

   pretty soon he telephoned down

    dots a nice mud-bat i got here
but vill you send up some clean water so
i git a wash-off wen im through

   george youngerman is chief clerk
there now and he got the call

   that isnt the way we do it here mr
metzger he replied  ring me up
when youre dry and ill send a bell-boy
up to brush you off 

   nice people down south comment-
ed andy crothers  but too pious mostly
for my business i handle feathers ex-
clusively and some of the churches ob-
ject to them there are whole sections
where i cant sell even a robbins wing
about the only chance the women have to
show off their clothes is at church and
every time a woman shows up with a
feather in her hat the preacher begins to
make remarks at her

   there are a few towns however right
in the middle of the religious section
where the women want the longest and
fluffiest feathers i carry if il were not
for them id have to cut out the whole
section

   one day i was in a pretty lively town
in kentucky where half the women go
regularly to meeting with flowers in their
hats and the other half dont go at all
and wear feathers while i was talking
to a customer in came one of the flower
kind and a new clerk not knowing the
difference began to show her some of the
latest hats all fussed over the top with
feathers

   my customer saw the womans sour
look so she called the girl over and said

    show her something cheap and vir-
tuous

in stop-over towns

   i showed my samples in a queer place
in a little iowa town broke in emil
holden who handles extiles  i ar-
rived late in the afternoon and the hotel
was full of traveling men there wasnt
a bed or a sample room to be had and
the only place to show my line was in the
street but one of my customers came
down to the depot and i opened a trunk
for him in the baggage-room

   he asked for goods i had in another
and in five minutes i had my samples all


the railroad mans magazine

over the baggage-room i slipped the
baggageman a couple of dollars and sent
word up-town that i could only keep my
trunks open an hour so they all came
down and made the fellows in the hotel
wait after i had finished i packed up
and ate supper in the next town

   i can beat that said george hard-
ing who goes on the road for half a
dozen manufacturers of brass novelties
 i have a customer in a jerk-water town
in kentucky who isnt quite worth a stop-
over because there is only one train a day
and there are more important towns on
the road

   on this last trip i wrote him to meet
me at the station and ride on to the next
town with me but when we pulled in he
wasnt there i had five minutes and i
used it to sprint a block and a half to his
store he said he was loaded up but i
told him that was  answer and he
promised to be on hand two days later
on my return trip

   coming back one of the pullmans
was empty i tipped the porter a dollar
he brought in a few trays of my best
stuff and i arranged it on the seats of
the whole car my customer was there
made his selections bought a bunch of
stuff and the whole deal was closed in
five minutes

  no one could match that but mort
goodkind had a story of two irish high-
graders from goldfield who went down
to san francisco in the same sleeper with
him they had a section between them
and when it came time to go to bed the
fellow who drew the upper merely
slipped off his shoes and rolled in the
one in the lower seemed to be encounter-
ing difficulties finally the one up above
called down

  whats the matter mike dont
you like your bunk every time i fall
asleep you give a bump and i wake up
  its this harmnick i have tried three
times to git into it and every time i fall
out

a tough hide

   who do you think is con in there 
asked fisher as he returned from the
diner  my old rubber jim miles you
know i used to be in the physical culture
business fie rubbed them down when i
got through he has only a thumb and

one finger on each hand but he can rub
with those he lost all the others bra-
king and i have often heard my cus-
tomers grunt out between groans  wish
the wreck had taken the other fingers too
he was too much for them-all except
the game old fellow who couldnt stand
punishment enough

  he was a withered specimen so i
took forty off him before i would begin
then i made him stand straight and
throw back his arms it nearly killed
him i thought his backbone would break
but i made him go through the regular
exercise and he kept up as best he could
when i got through i turned him over to
jim and whispered  go easy but jim
smiled and began to pound his tough old
hide

    you need a good rub to wake you
up jim said and the old fellow smiled
feebly then jim slapped him a few
times and rolling him over on his back
grabbed at his solar plexus to ease up the
stomach muscles the old man grinned
and said he liked it jim couldnt pum-
mel him more than he liked not him
he was a fiend for punishment

   finally jim gave him a couple that
made him wince and he looked down to
see if he wasnt bleeding he turned the
old fellow over and then it seemed as if
he was scraping the old mans backbone
all at once the old codger saw jims
thumb and forefinger and thats all he
could see the others he felt pulling his
insides loose he just fainted

how culley got even

   so this is albany said harry cul-
ley a clothing salesman as they pulled
into the station  im even with this
town now but it took me four years i
came in worn out one afternoon and fell
into the first barbers chair i saw i said
i wanted a shave and went right off to
sleep a long time afterward i woke up
and learned i had had a shave hair-cut
shampoo singe face massage scalp mas-
sage two or three kinds of rubs and the
check was two dollars and ten cents

   i laid down a quarter and started in
to clean out the place but they were pre-
pared for it and had me arrested for dis-
turbing the peace the fine was twenty-
five dollars and i didnt have but ten
told in the smoker



dollars after sleeping in jail all night
i had to wire my house and they never
quit thinking about the time i got drunk
in albany  remembered the face on
that barber i went back to albany later
to lick him and with plenty of money to
pay my fine but he was gone

   i was afraid i would never see him
again but i walked into a car down in
ohio last week and there he was i
could see he did not recognize me so i
sat down and made out that i was glad
to see him i told him i was an old cus-
tomer and he became quite friendly all
the time i was thinking how i could pay
him off

   we got off two or three times to-
gether at stations and at a long stop i
induced him to walk away from the train
he was nervous and looking back but i
told him we had plenty of time until the
train actually started then wre both ran
for it i kept ahead and jumped on the
last platform turning on the lower step
so he couldnt get a foothold the train
was going faster and faster and he was
getting red in the face but i stood there
he looked up to see why  didnt get out
of the way and i was grinning

    do you remember the time you had
me put in jail because you charged me two
dollars and ten cents for a shave 

   it came back to him in a flash but he
made a last effort to get aboard it was
almost too easy but  did it i put my
foot on his chesj and sent him sprawling

  were even i cried exultinglv
and he heard me even while his vest was
scraping the cinders

saved by his wife

   i was going to have a scrap with a
customer this trip you make me think
of it said alfred ringgold a clothing
salesman  nothing but his pretty fool
wife saved him

   maybe some of you remember louis
stern who was cutting prices on lower
state street in chicago a few years ago
it was him he thought he could do the
same kind of business in a country town
and failed what made me maddest was
that it was a good town and i had lost
money there in the same way they cut
prjces so low they spoiled their market
both of them i told stern to be careful

but he was a smart aleck and he said he
knew his own business

   when i was in omaha three weeks
ago the house wired me that he failed
and i went over to see what we could
save i found it in a bad way the stock
was all gone and the money with it i
was hot and  said what i thought

   you know what  told you i said
 but youre one of these fellows who
cant learn you knew abe harris failed
for thirty cents on the dollar with that
same kind of funny business but of course
you were so smart and you had to see if
you couldnt do worse

  his wife was standing right there

    oh but we dont fail so bad as that
she said  what was that you was say-
ing louis-we will fail for only ten cents
on the dollar 

down-east arithmetic

   that sounds like down-east arith-
metic laxighed harry culley  those
old fellows down there know how to fig-
ure everything to their advantage when
i was a youngster i traveled the coast
towns for a grocery house and made
every lobster-pot village on the map
most of them were ten to twenty miles off
the railroad and i had to hire a sort of
liuckboard they call a barge mostly i
went alone but now and then i found
some one to split the expense with me

   there was one little town out on a
point of land and going down there once
i picked up with the captain of a little
lobster-smack whod been in the interior
with his wife and kid

   we all drove down together and
when we arrived my customer was out to
meet us and i could tell by his manner
that the captain was a sort of local lion
and-he wanted to do him the honors we
began to unpack our stuff from the wagon
and the captain discovered the handle of
his umbrella had been broken

    what - broken  exclaimed my
customer and then turning on the boy
who drove us down he began now
look here youll hev to pay fer that you
caint drive the capll down here and
smash his umbrelly without payin fer it
how muchd this leetle shower-stick cost
you capn 

    lesse said the captain   bought


the railroad mans magazine

 that in boston a year and a half ago and
 i paid a dollar seventy-five cents fer it
   yes and you paid seventy-five cents
 to have it recovered last winter chirped
 his wife

      ysee said my customer  thats two
 and a half youll have to pay my boy

 and i laughed so i almost lost him

afraid it would go stale

    say what you like about the jie
 sighed mort goodkind  but i wished
 they learned how to make good yankee
 pie at the lunch-counters along the west-
 ern roads

     theres a town in colorado where the
 same pie stood on the lower shelf while
 i made two trips it looked so unwhole-
 some nobody coukl eat it i wish i had
 seen the fellow they tell about in nebras-
 ka who gave the lunch-counter a new start
 in life

     he came through on a train that was
 stalled a few stations above grand is-
 land and began looking around for en-
 tertainment the only thing worth no-
 ticing was the lunch-counter so he sized
 it up and the further he went the more
 interesting it became to him there was
 one pile of sandwiches he eyed so long
 that the girl behind the counter said -
   well ye goin to give yer mouth a
 chanct after a while

      gently now little girl he replied
  mustnt speak up in the presence of
 your elders i was just renewing the ac-
 quaintance of some of these old friends
 i saw when i passed through here with
 the grading crew of the union pacific

      and i was considering something
 he went on while the girl was thinking of
 a sharp answer  gimme two or three
 cups of coffee right away quick maybe
 i wont have time if you dont hurry

    then he began to stow away every-
 thing in sight starting on one end of the
 shelf and eating each thing as he came to
 it as fast as he could wash it down

     the girl stood there fascinated hard-
 ly able to keep count while he went

through sickly pie shriveled cake curled-
up sandwiches pickles boiled eggs char-
lotte-russe one after the other

   he kept the girl on the hotfoot after
coffee it got to be a pretty fierce con-
test between him and what was left on
the counter but he put it all away

    nine dollars and eighty cents the
girl said when he finished

    you neednt take so much satisfac-
tion out of it he remarked as he paid

 it was worth it to me when i come
along here in another thirty or forty years
therell be something fresh on the coun-
ter   

when maudie spoke

   i know a girl who would have had an
answer for him all right said fisher
getting back into the conversation  fler
name is maudie and she is down in the
hard coal section of pennsylvania some-
thing like a thousand times a year she
throws a hot platter at a bunch of miners
and in fifteen minutes she has the table
cleared and set for the next meal

   no monkey business about the way
those fellows eat and she was used to
their ways but along came t arthur
chauncey he used to be on the road
with textiles before he got his bit from
home dont you know he was one of
these neat and careful fellows-always
chewed his-food well he was held up
in the town where maudie worked and
had-to eat there maudie served him

   he took what was set down in front
of him without saying anything eating off
the edges but when she brought him a 
thick cup slopping over with coffee and
milk he said to her mildly

    i say dont you know i like mine
black my fine girl and hot very hot and
have it made strong quite strong

   maudie listened to all this and then
she sung out to the colored cook through
the hole in the wall

    oh percy make a fresh pot and
make it hot blamed hot and strong
blamed strong for a blamed particular

observations of a country
station-agent

no  - the trials and tribulations of captain fish who had that
suffering air of martyrdom and all other natural heritages
that make the ideal claim-agent

apt ain fish over on the

  h b and m was designed
by nature to be a claim-
agent for a railroad fie
goes about with a shrink-
ing suffering air of martyr-
dom he talks with soft and apologetic
voice fi is meekness and sufferance and
sadness and wo all natural heritages
serve to put the claimant in the attitude
of robbing the lowly and deserving and
keeps the settling figures down to the
point which human sympathy indicates

  there are claim-agents who are bold
and combative who aim rigidly at the
strictly legal aspect of affairs and to
whom a fellow feeling is unknown they
harvest lawsuits and ill will

  not so with captain fish neither
judge nor jury for him i-ie sees nothing
but the good intent and poverty of his
road and the compassion of the people
on these human lines he settles every-
thing

  when he draws his pay it pains him
to tears of commiseration that he has to
take the money from the company

  so his life is sad for he is compelled
t allow a little here and a little there
vouchers will always follow vouchers

  when the seasons are dry and the loco-
niotive-spark leaves its trail of desolation
along the adjoining meadows and wood
the captain enters upon a period of ad-
justment

  then he is in a state of mind that makes
 the melancholy days are here  appear
like the visit of a three-ring circus in a
coon town

  all in all the captain saves his road a
great deal of money keeps litigation down
to near zero and does it all with that dis-
mal wobegone cast of countenance and
that doleful voice-all bequeathed him by
the creator

  far be it for me to indicate that these
sepulchral qualities constitute the cap-
tains entire repertoire he has in addi-
tion the fine art of judging human na-
ture accurately and turning to advantage
the qualities he finds in his fellow man

  delay conciliation and compromise
are the weapons used by the captain to
meet the complaints that come to him

  i am indebted to the captain for the
tales that follow

  one dismal day we fell to talking
about the railroads and the  peeple

  the captain bewailed with a sort of
dyspeptic sorrow the lack of honesty and

series began la the july  railroad mans magazine single copies  cents

perspicacity in the common run ofhuman
kind

    if saicl he  we kill a cow it is al-
ways a pedigreed holstein and the most
valuable animal on the farm if we burn
a meadow the timothy runs three tons to
the acre no train ever killed an elm-
peeler hog when we deal out death and
destruction we invariably hit the finest
and most highly prized things the earth
produces

   dont the claimants ever volunteer
the correct value information i asked
innocently

     never had that experience but one
time replied the captain dryly  may-
be you have been on your back with a
fever you have well you will recall
how your mind went whirling around
with all kinds of crazy and exaggerated
ideas and images and most of them re-
lated to your business

   when i was down with the typhoid
my distorted fancy was all the time ad-
justing claims one day i thought we
had killed a horse and i went over to the
owner we walked down on the railroad
together and sat down on the grassy
bank

    captain said the owner  that
horse was the worst old crow-bait on the
farm he was twenty-seven years old
this summer he hasnt done a lick of
work for three years only to eat up my
good corn and hay but hes always been
in the family and we had sentimental-
reasons for not turning him out to die

i calculate youve saved me twenty dol-
lars a year and i will be glad to present
the company with ten dollars as a mark
of appreciation for what they have done
for me oh no he didnt get onto the
track through a defective fence he got
on at the public highway any one can
see that-

    my pulse let out a few extra kicks
and my fever went up a few notches i
have a hazy remembrance of the old doc-
tor  hes taken a turn for the worse
said he youd better notify his folks

    it came pretty near putting the finish-
ing touches to me it takes a good con-
stitution to get over a shock like that

   a railroad is always on the defen-
sive continued the captain  no mat-
ter which direction we take or which way
we turn or what we propose we are held

up harassed enjoined and blackmailed
we are the legitimate prey of all the
unscrupulous gorillas and rapacious free-
booters that infest this fair land and con-
stitute we will say continued the cap-
tain reflectively  about eighty or ninety
per cent of the population

   you and i captain said i by way
of cheer  are trailing along in a hope-
less minority

   i am retorted the captain  that
much is sure i know i am

  the captain went solemnly into a near-
by cafe and under the genial inspiration
of a glass of cold water and a bowl of
chopped elm shavings with blue milk
narrated some of the experiences of a
man whose duty it is to investigate the
petty claims that come from the people
along his railway

  one day the captain found a letter on
his desk  respectfully referred it was
addressed to the president of the road
but by the  respectfully referred  route
it reached the captains desk in due time
it read	r

               grafthurst ind aug 
   dear sir  honored
   your trane kilt  of my best hogs fri-
   day night i showd your sec foreman
   where they got under the fence but he
   gif me no satisfaction i want pay for
   them hogs and darn quick

                           cris baily

   it is a curious fact and but little known
outside how large a proportion of the
letters of complaint that come to a rail-
road office make summary demands and
convey a threat or intimation indicating
the pugnacious attitude of the writer the
first crude thought of the unsophisticated
mind is that a show of belligerency will
frighten the officials into immediate set-
tlement

  many a letter has contained this omi-
nous ultimatum  ill give you just five
days to pay for that spotted calf

   it gratifies the writer for his unbaked
fancy sees the claim - agent making the
double hump and taking the hurdles to
keep within the limit

  but here are the cold facts regardless
of the time limit set by the claimant and
the dire consequences to follow spotted
calves are never settled for in five days
the claim-agent doggedly faces the perils
observations of a country station-agent 

it pajns him to tears of commiseration that he
has to take the money from the company

of delay and goes about the neces-
sary investigation in the usual way

if a voucher comes to the claimant
it comes along with the same old
circumlocution that all vouchers
take

  so it is noted of the captain
when he read cris bailys closing
sentence  i want pay for them
hogs and darn quick he neither
batted an eye nor drew an extra
breath

  in a general way a claim-agent
after a number of years on a road
learns to know fairly well a ma-
jority of the farmers owning land
adjoining the railroad

  in this instance cris baily was
an unknown quantity to the cap-
tain he was a recent arrival and
only a small portion of his farm
containing a wood pasture
touched the right of way this
was the first matter that had come
up between baily and the railroad
and the captain thought it wise to
reconnoiter about the neighbor-
hood and learn what he could and
to inspect the fences before ap-
proaching baily direct

  in common law a man is held
innocent until proven guilty in railroad
law a claim is fraudulent until proven
valid

  the captain visited the spot where the
eight porkers came to iheir tragic end
he examined the fences and found where
they had crawled under and onto the
right of way

  a railroad company builds and main-
tains all fences and they must be hog-
proof-even to barring out the little curly
tailed piglets granger legislation has
seen to all of that failing to have them
so puts the liability on the company

  the captain convinced himself that in
this particular case the companys de-
fense was weak but he wanted to know
more he wanted further information
about hogs in general and about the
claimant in particular and this he pro-
ceeded to get

  he drove out to the neighborhood
where baily lived and in an aimless sort
of way drove into the barn-yard of a
neighboring farmer to water his horse

   this has been a pretty good year for

farmers hasnt it asked the captain in
friendly conversational venture

   well i dont know so much about
that responded the farmer  suppose
we ortnt complain but wheat aint turn
ing out anything extra it didnt fill as
well as i thought it would

   fine weather were having said the
captain

   not as fine as it might be corn
needs rain purty bad right now i reckon
if it dont rain inside o ten days we
wont have much moren nubbins

   spose you raise a good many cattle
and hogs i see hogs quoted at eight
dollars and thirty cents yesterday thats
about the fanciest price i ever knew hogs
to be

   flub the year after the war they
wus twelve dollars they wus worth
raisin in them days aint been nothing
like it since for a farmer

   still there ought to be good money
in hogs at eight dollars persisted the
captain

   they ort to be but they aint always


the railroad mans magazine

replied the farmer with a look of disgust
on his face people think a fanners
always makin so much money they
dont know what hes up agin all the
time

   now take hogs for instant that you

  about ten replied the farmer
 your neighbor baily- has he lost

 any  

  cris had a bunch bout to die i
 dont know just how many he keeps his
 pigs in the wood pasture down on the

wus just talking about if a farmer feeds
seventy-five-eent corn into a parcel of
shoats until they get to weighn two or
three hundred then in one week the chol-
era comes along and lays out the whole
bunch you wouldnt think that wus such
a durned money-makin scheme would
you heh even if they are eight dol-
lars a hundred

   i didnt know there was any such
thing as hog cholera any more said the
captain  i thought medical science had
done away with all those anthrax dis-
orders

   you must be a stranger in these parts
why sir there havn right here now
the worst siege of hog cholera ive ever
knowd

   indeed  is that so  exclaimed the
captain in surprise  have vou lost
any  

railroad a hired hand who was workin
for me happed down there and told me
he counted eight dead ons the next day
i heard eight of em had been killed on
the railroad that aint quite as lingerin
as cholera and it pays better to have em
go that way but aint all of us got a
railroad handy that we can drag the car-
casses onto 

    where is this hired hand  asked the
captain somewhat eagerly

   dont have any idea replied the
farmer  he tramped in just stayed
with me during harvest and slid out
dont even know his name - only joe
youll never see him agin hes just one
of them floaters that dont stay long any
place hes a hundred miles from here
by this time and i dont even know what
direction he took

   is baily a pretty square sort of a

so much money

observations of a country station-agent 

man  asked the captain  does he bear
a good reputation

   well i cant say much about that
replied the farmer  he come here
from tennessee two years ago its been
whispered around that he was moon-
shinin down there and was run out by
government men its been said be run
away with another mans wife and come
up here i dont know if all thats so or
not but i aint surprised eny

   tell you the truth stranger i dont
take no stock in him as for them hogs
bein killed by a train- i got my own
opinion - but what eny of us thinks
wouldnt go in court

  it looks more like rain to-day than it
did yesterday wouldnt be surprised if
we didnt have a plenty before the weeks
out wont you unhitch and eat a bite
oh well- good day good day 
the captain had the facts

  cris bailys hogs had died of cholera
and he had placed them on the track ex-
pecting to collect from the railroad

  when it comes to fighting and rebut-
ting an unjust claim the captain was tire-
less and resourceful in this case there
seemed but one way open in the absence
of proof confront baily boldly accuse
him and bluff him into acknowledgment
and withdrawal

  but could a tennessee ex-moonshiner
be bluffed if not what next let him
sue stand trial tell a jury of farm-
ers our suspicions  nix thought the cap-
tain proof must be found

  the captain headed for cris bailys
before him there was a turn of the road
and in the angle was an open piece of
ground with a clump of trees

  under their shading hospitality some
gipsies had camped with the usual as-
sortment of broken-down horses rickety
wagons dogs swarthy sanyoras and
ragged children

  the captain stopped

  he was in sight of cris bailys house
and he could plainly see baily out near
the barn doing some work

jnoeman bmo

you puta pigs on the track


the railroad mans magazine

  two of the vagabond queens rushed
out to the captain one reached for his
hand

  tell a fortune she cried impor-
tuninglv  tell a fortune-the past and
the future - only ten a centa  good
luck good luck all about

  the captain instinctively drew back his
hand

  hold on said the captain not
so fast my tawny skinned sorceress most
of us would give you something not to
tell the past and the future be hanged
but say do you see that man up yonder
near the barn  

  they nodded an affirmative

    if youll go up there and tell his for-
tune-handing him some of the past and
laying it heavy on the future-ill give
you a dollar

  the swarthy mendicants jumped at the
chance for sudden wealth

  the captain held a rehearsal he jug-
gled cris bailys past went into his fu-
ture and made the fortune-tellers under-
stand

  cris baily was grinding a scythe un-
conscious of revelations when suddenly
confronted by the two dark-eyed tur-
baned revealers of the hidden

  one of them grabbed his hand

   telia your fortune  she cried
 tena cent i read it in a hand the
lines they tell-

   clear out  yelled cris getting his
wind  off with you git 

  you maka whisky one time per-
sisted the woman unblinkingly  they
liunta you long time-police-in a south
-mountains - and a woods - you geta
away 

   hold on  what are you giving me 
cried cris

   i reada your hand the lines they
tell i know alia the past i tella the
fute everything i gotta the power 
cris held out his hand

 go on go   he cried eagerly
 is there anything else heres a dime
she bent over the palm of his hand

   you gotta away you taka a wom-
an--another woman nota your wife
no  no  an you cornea here 

  thats enough cried cris stand-
ing up stiff and pale  i dont want any
more 

  the woman held on doggedly

  the future it all lieie the woman
went on  it looka dark penetentiare
prison  prison  they send a you up 
it looka dark i see all everything
you puta pigs on the track railroad
engine cornea along i know i see
soon they cornea along and get you for
that soon ver soon they locka
you up long long time i tell it you et
all true some one knows and railroad
finda et all out all ver soon

  cris jerked his hand away and started
for the house but he stopped turned
and called after the witches

  when they returned to camp they had
from cris baily all the chickens corn
and farm produce they coufd lug the
patient waiting captain knew all this
plunder was the sign and seal of secrecy
and he drove away in triumphant satis-
faction

  in the course of a few days by the
 respectfully referred  route another
letter found its way to the captains desk
it read

               grafthurst ind aug -
  pkest of r r

    i wrote you two weeks ago about my
  clame for ate  hogs which was killed
  on your track i find i am to blame for
  them hogs gittin  the track as i made
  a bad place in the fence and i forgot to
  fix it up i want to do whats fare and
  wright between man and man and i
  withdraw my clame-i remane

          very truly yours cris baily

    p s-there aint nothing for the rail-
  road to pay everything is now square-
  right is right

  the captain let out that jubilant
chuckle of conquest known only to pluto
and the railroad claim-agent

  it pains the writer after showing the
cleverness of the captain in the above
story to be compelled to narrate another
wherein he emerges with less distinction
but railroad experiences must be given as
they occur and without regard to the
merit praise or humiliation of the ones
involved

  the poet who sings paeans of praise to
womankind extolling her beauty and gen-
tleness evidently never met ann hamer-
walt or he would have found the need of
a discordant line in the chorus

  architecturally ann is a sky-scraper
without ornaments
observations of a country station-agent 

  she owns a piece of land touching the
railroad and she rules over it like a pagan
queen she lives alone and defies man-
kind in all the courts

  when a trespasser or a luckless hunter
or a mendicant pedler or any other of the
itinerary gentry encroaches upon her pre-
serves ann delivers a  move on   com-
mand that makes her easily the military
figure of the district

  there is no open-hearted hospitality
for the neighborhood at anns and no

 is this mrs hamerwalt asked the
 captain with ingratiating suavity

  yes sir  came the tart reply

  i am captain fish the railroad claim-
 agent

  come in set down right there 

 it wasnt an invitation it was a com-
 mand  and the captain like a true sol-
 dier obeyed

 when the captain was seated ann
 arose to her full six feet of regal majesty
 -to her full queenly stature she was

convinced himself that in this particular case the companys
defense was weak

 welcome  motto hangs over the door
for the wayfaring stranger

  one day a vagrant spark from a pass-
ing locomotive touched off some dry
grass and when the smoke had cleared
away a number of rods of rail fence run-
ning up toward anns house were de-
stroyed

  the section foreman with the instinct
of a true fireman arrived too late and
ann turned on him with ribald abuse

  the section foreman said he would re-
port it at once and that the claim-agent
would be along to settle the damage

  after a number of days the captain ap-
peared at ann hamerwalts door

    r r

somewhat bent and brown and unkempt
and not so regal or queenly that you would
notice it

 ann assumed the aggressive

 you know that your engine set that
fence afire dont you 

 from what evidence we have we
think-

  there aint any think about it you
 know it 

 well we havent-

 yes you have snapped ann  you
know it you aint a fool you know you
burned my fence maybe you think just
because im a woman youll fool me or
bluff me


the railroad mans magazine

  ann gave a whistle and instantly a
bulldog appeared with his front feet on
the door-step and cast a red suspicious
eye on the captain  lay down bull 
the dog occupied the doorway and
kept the captain under a cold unblinking
surveillance

   it is this way mrs hamerwalt said
the captain feigning an easy indifference
 well say that our engine set the fence
afire but we must know just how many
rods and how many rails and how old
the fence was and what condition the ma-
terial was-

  youll pay me just fifteen dollars
said ann briskly

   that seems somewhat excessive i-
no use to argue about it thats it
fifteen dollars i know what a fences
worth and i know what you burned 

    very well said the captain  i will
put it up to the company that way and
well see what they think of it

   what they think  shrieked ann
 its what i think i chink fifteen dol-
lars  and thats all there is to it 

   oh very well replied the captain
assuringly  the company may think
that is a reasonable figure it will take
a little time

    its fifteen dollars and its goin to be
paid and its goin to be paid right now  
right now exclaimed the aston-
ished captain  why madam thats im-
possible the matter must be referred
and approved

   the captain arose as if to exit but the
dog with a projecting jaw let out an
ominous signal that effectually flagged
the captain who at once resumed his seat
and assumed a humble conciliatory tone

    well make it fifteen dollars mrs
hamerwalt he said  we want to deal
fairly with you ill see that you get your
money you see mrs hamerwalt when
a claim is paid the papers must pass
through a number of departments and
the treasurer of the road finally draws a
voucher for the amount

   that may be your way but my ways
different retorted ann  you burned
the fence its fifteen dollars and youre
goin to pay-and before you leave this
house youve got the money and youre
goin to fork it over right here and now 
ann gave the table an emphatic thump
 why really mrs hamerwalt pro-

tested the captain  this is extraordinary
this is a most unusual and high-handed
proceeding i must say mrs hamer-
walt-

   there aint any use havn any more
words you heard what i said thats
all there is to it 

  now the woman had a double-barreled
shotgun in the corner and a brute of a
bulldog in the door a braver man than
the captain would have reckoned twice or
thrice before going against this combina-
tion

  the captain did not have the courage to
make a break for liberty the captain
had always found this a world of sorrow
and injustice but he was taking no
chances on any unexpected exit from it
so he went deep down in his pocket and
extracted the last farthing and alto-
gether it totaled ten dollars and forty
cents then he offered to add his watch
but ann observed dryly that  purty
good-looking watches are sold for a dol-
lar and maybe thats one of them

  at length when the captain with one
keen jump cleared the barbed-wire fence
from the domain of ann hamerwalt and
lit on the right of way of the railroad he
was moneyless watchless and coatless

  then the captain went up and bor-
rowed five dollars of the station-agent
and got the section foreman to go over
to ann hamerwalts with it and rescue
the watch and coat

  it was one of the neatest and quickest
settlements ever effected the captain
acknowledged that

  some time ago an old man who lost a
cow on a certain road received a voucher
for forty dollars and cashed it on his
way home he lost his pocketbook and
this misfortune moved him to write the
following letter to the railroad

  dear sir 

  i am an old man and me and the old
  woman live alone we havent but a
  little of this worlds goods and we
  have a hard time getting along we go
  to church regular i am an old soldier

  i was with rosencrans at corinth and
  murfreesboro and stone river i al-
  ways vote the republican ticket you
  are a great corporation and have got
  lots of money because the countrys
  what it is and i helpt make it that way
  what is forty dollars to you you
  would never miss it i lost that 
observations of a country station-agent 

dollars that you paid me for my cow
i thought if i explained it to you and
all about myself maybe you would pay
it again think it over with the great-
est respect and well wishes  am yours
very truly	uriah h small

  this appeal has a touch of piety and
patriotism and being of a sentimental
turn it pains me to add that the railroad

seeing by wire has long been the dream
ofmost inventors and not a few in the
past have wasted both time and energy in
attempting to solve the mystery

  it has however fallen to the lot of two
danes brothers named andersen says rail-
road men to be the first to invent an appa-
ratus by which can be seen what is going
on at the other end of a telephone wire

  the details of the invention are naturally
kept secret but there appears to be no doubt
as to its genuineness an engineer of high
repute has just tested the claims of the an-
dersens and the expert declared the claim
to be entirely justified

  the process is described as entirely new
and very simple it differs from the korn
and other systems of phototelegraphy inas-
much as it makes no use of photography but
transmits light and colors directly any
person speaking at a telephone fitted with
the apparatus can be readily seen from the
other end of the wire and he likewise can
show anything he desires to exhibit across

  the andersens have taken eight years to
probe the mystery they arc of humble par-

urged the brakeman

   all right show us the car come
on freddie

  the brakeman led the way to a box
car half filled with coal  get in here
an keep back out of sight

  eldon-climbed in after the lad and the
two crawled far back into a corner

  this kind of travel was a new experi-
ence for john eldon however when
ones boy has a cough that the doctor
says will develop into consumption unless
he is taken to a better climate and when
the mill in which a man labors is shut
down there is not much choice

  although the roofs of the passenger-
coaches offered a much swifter mode of
travel he had decided to make his way
more slowly by freight-train on account
of freddie he believed that with the
few dollars he had he could pay the
brakemen and have a little left at the
journeys end

  from various bits of misinformation
he had formed the erroneous if popular
idea that all trainmen are dishonest col-
lecting money from tramps whenever the

opportunity offers having fallen in
with such a one although they are as
numerous as white crows at the outset of
his journey his original opinion was con-
firmed

   gee im glad were started  whis-
pered the boy as the car jerked forward

   heaven knows i wish it was over
muttered his father grimly

  presently the lad huddled down on the
coal and fell asleep the man after cov-
ering the small form with his coat crept
forward to the door and gazed at the
moonlit waste as it passed in his slow
way john eldon was worried since the
death of his wife his whole interest cen-
tered on the child now if not success-
ful in making his way south or on ar-
riving if he could not secure proper care
for the little fellow-he was likely to be
left alone

   come out of that what you doin
in there  it was another brakeman who
clambered in at the door  you better
drop off right here we dont carry boes
on this train

   i paid one of you fellers to take me
to woodville replied eldon sullenly

  said hed take you did he well
he cant take you on this train and the
sooner you grasp that the better itll be
for you

  knowing that the brakeman could en-
force his command eldon aroused fred-
die whom the other now observed for the
first time

   hold on there that boy cant walk
anywhere this time of night i guess you
can stay on till we reach woodville
were nearly there now thats as far
as we go so you want to be careful you
dont get pinched


when the devil drives



   much obliged responded eldon

  when he heard the whistle of the en-
gine he prepared to leave the train

   think youre good for the rest of the
night on the rods freddie 

   yes  think so

   thats what well have to do if they
wont let us go in the cars but itll not
be many days till were there then well
get you cured of that cough he spoke
almost tenderly

  as the train slackened speed eldon
watched for a favorable moment and



   this is luck said the man halting
beside the water-tank  now if we can
find an open car well be all right you
stay here while i look for one

  he left freddie in the shadow and hur-

with the boy dropped to the ground
stealthily making their way along the
lines of cars they came to the other end
of the yards where they found another
train on the side-track ready to pull out

harrison bathed the grimy
little face until it was
whiter than his own

ried down the length of the train looking
for an open door concealing himself
whenever he saw a lantern approaching
he was determined to have no more deal-
ings with brakemen unsuccessful in his
quest he returned to the tank

 i guess itll be the rods sure enough
he whispered seeing a lantern station-
ary a few feet on the opposite side of the
tank he added be quiet until that
feller moves on if we can git in on the
rods without them seein us i think well


the railroad mans magazine

be safe well have to wait till she starts
though

   with the creak of loosening brakes the
long train began to move eldon selected
a huge furniture-car with low-hanging
rods and helped the boy under

   now lay cross-ways an dont go
to sleep he admonished  if you git
too tired wait till we come to a grade
an crawl out ill be on the rods next
car back

    all right dad freddie answered
wearily

   funny thing nobody saw us re-
flected eldon taking his place under the
car he had chosen for himself

  for some time he watched the ties
flickering swiftly beneath him and the
rails like ribbons running smoothly from
under the wheels then the train started
up a long grade the ties passed less and
less rapidly until they seemed to move
but little faster than a man could walk
eldon had fallen into a half-doze

   from somewhere in front came a hol-
low thump repeated several times at short
intervals

    sounds like some ones poundin on
the cars observed eldon drowsily so
in fact they were but he little suspected
for what purpose

  any hobo could have explained the
sounds had he been told that  stoney 
harrison was on this train he never
took money from any one whom he caught
stealing a ride instead lie seemed to
encourage the practise by pretending not
to see the culprits until they reached
the clark mountain grade when he
would jump to the ground and run along
beside the cars pelting the unfortunates
on the rods with rocks by this playful
habit he had almost stopped the liobo-
travel on that division

   because eldon knew nothing of this
he paid little attention to the sounds the
loud roar of escaping steam from the
engine was almost deafening but had
he listened closely he might have heard
a faint shrill cry soon he noted that
more dust than usual was in the air
something was being dragged lay the for-
ward trucks the moment he saw it
the thing worked free it came toward
him with trembling hand he seized the
limp shape raised it and looked into the
bruised bloody face of his boy

  stoney harrison muttered to himself as
he gathered another armful of rocks  i
bet them boes  wish theyd forgot to
come on this train before im through
with em

  turning he saw a huge dusty figure
stagger from the shadow of the train
bearing a bundle hi its arms with a
gasp of comprehension the brakeman
started forward

   why its a kid  my god  whatve
i done whatve i done put im down
you fool such a little feller an i done
it-i knocked im off oh i cant stand
it 

  harrison was sobbing brokenly as he
worked over the boy listening for the
feeble heart-beats

  eldon had stood aside momentarily
awed by the others emotion

   you killed him and im agoin to
kill you goin to mash you he said
calmly beginning to remove his coat
the mad gleam in his eyes was all that
betrayed his fur

  with an effort the brakeman con-
trolled his voice  he aint dead you
big mutt you go over by them bushes
an git some water in your hat now
hurry

  when the water was brought harrison
bathed the grimy little face until it was
whiter than his own and with his fingers
brushed the cinders out of the matted
hair eldon dumbly chafed the boys
hands after weary hours of suspense
freddie opened his eyes seemingly awa-
kened by the far-off shriek of a locomo-
tive that echoed among the hills

   harrison arose stiffly to his feet

   thats the south-bound passenger
im goin to flag er you an the kid
can get on an stay on till you get to
where youre goin heres some money

i	got my pay yesterday so you can buy
the little feller somethin to eat

  as eldon hesitated he continued bit-
terly  you dont need to worry about
gettin even just tell the people on that
train what i done an theyll see that you
git satisfaction the boys re all down
on me anyway

  eldons face lighted with a sudden re-
solve  not by a jugful ill tell em
-you saved my boy-that youre white
clear through

the jarrett  palmer special

by fred w saward

the account of this record trip of thirty-four years ago we are sure will
prove as interesting to the younger men of the railway world of to-day
as to their elders who are furnishing the stories for this department
it was something to have taken a train clear across the united states in those
days-it was an achievement worth recording in these pages and we are glad
to have the opportunity

    think of spinning down the steep grades of the rockies under hand-
brakes think of one engine running the entire distance from ogden utah
to oakland california those were some of the interesting features of the
run of this famous trip

with the crudities of early - day facilities the time made by this
train for  miles- hours  minutes-was the estab-
lished record for  years

ihe railroad man lives much	witnessed some achievements of notable

in the present and yet he	consequence

finds interest in the achieve- while the pyramids and other vast ac-

ments of the past there-	complishments of early days might be

fore let us look back at	and probably were put together rather

in those days  is an old assertion and	the same narrow wheelway of iron and

the railroad mans magazine

  with all the crudities of early-day fa-
cilities there was accomplished in the
centennial year a transcontinental trip
from jersey city new jersey to san
francisco california which established
a record that was not excelled for nearly
thirty years

   it is true that over certain portions of
the route in the intervening years various
trains from time to time made greater
speed but such limited feats are more
easily accomplished of course than is one
great through run from ocean to ocean
therefore it was in every way remarkable
that the jarrett  palmer special train
of june -  established a record of
eighty-three hours and thirty-seven min-
utes for the trip to the golden gate-
a record that was not equaled until the
late e h harriman hurrying back from
his activities in stricken san francisco
achieved in may  the wonderful
transcontinental time of seventy-one hours
and twenty - seven minutes-just thirty-
three minutes less than three days the
best schedule time of to-day is one hun-
dred hours and fifty-eight minutes

object of the train

  the jarrett  palmer train made a
specially arranged trip to transport the
leading members of a theatrical company
across the country it was as will be re-
called the centennial year every one
was thinking of our nations century of
progress the rail route to the pacific was
almost a novelty-only seven years old-
and so it seemed most opportune for the
theatrical people in question to secure
good press-agent stuff at that particular
time by making a record run such as had
never been accomplished before

  moreover the- pennsylvania railroad
people were then getting their road in ex-
cellent condition according to the mod-
erate standards of that day and having
already made certain experiments of their
own in fast running from jersey city to
pittsburgh and even to chicago the man-
agement fell in very readily with the
proposition to start a fast special train
on its way to the pacific coast

  it was at  am on the morning of
june   that the record - making
train left jersey city and oakland cali-
fornia from whence the ferry to san

francisco was taken was reached june

	at  pm new york time or 
am san francisco time san francisco
itself was reached by boat at  am
local time this made an actual record
from ferry to ferry jersey city to oak-
land of eighty - three hours and thirty-
seven minutes-just a little less than three
and a half days

a notable achievement

  when we consider that the scheduled
running time of the period averaged seven
and a half to eight days it will be realized
how notable was the achievement of the
jarrett  palmer special and partic-
ularly it is to be noted that the period avas
not far removed from the days of lewis
and clark and the pioneers of the over-
land route being in fact less than thirty
years after the gold-seekers rush to cali-
fornia in 

  a paragraph of contemporaneous com-
ment states that no unpleasant experiences
marred the trip but it is quite probable
that the passengers had a bit of shaking
up and were often unsteady on their feet
if they wished to stroll about for un-
doubtedly it was not all smooth sailing
over the long route in those early days
despite all efforts made to have the lines
as clear as possible there were of course
innumerable slow-ups and minor delays
incidental toso long a trip

the make-up

  the train consisted of a baggage-car
a coach designated as a smoking and com-
missary car and one pullman sleeper
the baggage-car served the very practical
purpose of carrying an additional supply
of coal as well as the luggage of the
travelers and this was an important de-
tail for be it known the entire distance
from jersey city to pittsburgh was run
without a stop

  while it was an easy matter to take
water from the track tanks of the penn-
sylvania railroad it was necessary to re-
plenish the supply of coal on the tender
from bags of fuel carried in the forward
part of the baggage-car eight bags of
first-class mail were also carried by re-
quest of the post-office department

the route was over six different rail-
the jarrett  palmer special



road lines for in those days the pennsyl-
vania route to chicago was operated as
three separate roads - the united rail-
road of new jersey jersey city to phil-
adelphia the pennsylvania railroad
philadelphia to pittsburgh and the
pittsburgh fort wayne and chicago
from there on to the lakeside city

  from chicago the route westward was
over the chicago and northwestern to
council bluffs the union pacific from
council bluffs to ogden and the central
pacific from ogden to san francisco
california

  the total distance was three thousand
three hundred and sixteen miles and the
weight of the train was one hundred and
twenty-six tons the rate of speed in-
cluding stops for the whole distance was
equivalent to forty miles an hour what
might be termed sectional details of the
trip were as follows 

  jersey city to pittsburgh  miles-

	hours  minutes

  pittsburgh to chicago  miles-
hours  minutes

  chicago to council bluffs s miles-

	hours  minutes

  council bluffs to ogden  miles-
 hours  minutes

  ogden to san francisco  miles-
 hours  minutes

  these time-figures aggregate  hours
 minutes so that apparently  hours
 minutes were involved in what might
be termed division terminal delays

  it will be noticed that only in the in-
stances of the chicago eighteen  hour
trains is the distance between jersey city
chicago or any of the farther points
noted above covered in any better time
by regular trains to  day - thirty - three
years after the above recorded feat

some of the passengers

  the passengers on the record-breaking
train of the centennial year included the
prominent members of the jarrett 
palmer theatrical company a few men
identified with transportation interests
and several representatives of the foreign
and american press in all perhaps thir-
ty persons covered more or less of the dis-
tance and the rate of fare to the through
passengers was said to be five hundred
dollars each

   a j cassatt the late president of the
pennsylvania railroad company was
then a young man of thirty-seven but had
already attained the rank of third vice-
president of the road and was becoming
known as a capitalist he took a deep
interest in the speed accomplishments of
the day and made the trip to chicago on
the train

  another very prominent passenger was
general horace porter then fresh from
his interesting career with general grant
in the field and in the white house hold-
ing at the time the vice-presidency of the
pullman palace car company he was
a passenger as far as chicago and some
time ago while ambassador to france
wrote from paris in answer to a request
for his recollections of the trip explain-
ing that among other details

   as many engineers accompanied the
train as there were divisions on the route
between stops so that the engine could be
run over each section by an engineer fa-
miliar with that run

    the train was greeted by brass bands
and fireworks at several points and the
passengers returned the compliments in a
measure by setting off fireworks from the
rear platform of the last car when pass-
ing large towns

  lawrence barrett was the leading man
of the j arrett  palmer company and his
managers as general porter recalls the
circumstances were desirous of opening
in san francisco prior to the opening of
a theatrical season by an english actor in
similar repertoire

it appeared reckless

   as one looks back it must appear that
it was a reckless enterprise - rushing
across the continent at such speed under
the prevailing conditions railroad sig-
naling had not reached anything like the
present system of automatic blocks and
power interlocking installations air-
brakes were new and far from their pres-
ent degree of perfection rails were light
and ballasting excepting on the pennsyl-
vania itself was of nothing like the pres-
ent standard

  it is only when we look back at the
many changes in construction the reduc-
tion in grades and the elimination of
curves that have been achieved in recent
-

the railroad mans magazine

years when we consider the heavier rails
now in use the amount of second track
that has been put in place and the devel-
opment of motive power that we realize
what was accomplished in spite of the
crudities of the period

   in is there were no vestibule cars
the pullman sleepers were far from the
standard of the present type and dining-
cars were primitive in arrangement in
fact it might be -saicl that all cars of the
present day are larger heavier and safer
than those of a generation ago with bet-
ter equipment in every degree

  the trip over the pennsylvania pre-
sented no notable physical difficulties
aside from the crossing of the alleghany
mountains at an elevation of two thou-
sand two hundred and fifty feet above the
sea from pittsburgh to chicago and the
missouri river the line is as a rule level
but there were in those days innumerable
grade crossings of railroads and high
ways requiring caution beyond omaha
the country becomes steadily more rugged
the rocky mountains were crossed at an
elevation of eight thousand two hundred
and forty-two feet and the sierra neva-
das at seven thousand and forty-two feet

one engines run

   naturally the greatest degree of inter-
est attached to the trip over the central
pacific the line built during the civil
war days in the face of great financial
technical and commercial difficulties

  over this rugged route only a little
better than thirty-six miles an hour could
be accomplished in the absence of track
tanks time was required to take water
and as one locomotive was run through
the entire distance from ogden to oak-
land wharf it was necessary to stop for
coal as well

  so long a run by one engine was one
of the most notable features of the trip
the locomotive was one of the products
of the schenectady locomotive works
and would be accounted small indeed to-
day weighing only sixty-five thousand
four hundred and fifty pounds as a re-
sult of the fast trip across the continent
with many cautionary slow - downs the
brake-shoes on the cars were badly worn
on arrival at ogden and the central pa-
cific people not having any of the same

pattern to replace them the train was run
by hand - brakes only from ogden to
t ruckee

   the speed was materially lessened on
the heavy descending grades as the men
feared losing control of the train

   on arrival at truckee nevada a cen-
tral pacific car with air-brakes in good
order was coupled onto the train in order
that the trip down the mountain might be
made safely and at the next station be-
yond summit a second additional car
was coupled in as a further precautionary
measure

   when the obstacles in the way of heavy
grades and curves of which the line from
ogden to oakland wharf consists are
taken into consideration it will be seen
that pretty fast running was indulged in

through the sierras

   from ogden to wells  miles the
line is broken much of it curved with
maximum grades of  feet per mile the
sum of the ascending grades between these
two points being then  feet from
wells to wadsworth  miles the grade
is generally descending with a great many
sharp curves in the canon of the hum-
boldt river which of course are not con-
ducive to fast running from wadsworth
to the summit of the sierra nevadas 
miles is a continuous ascending grade
maximum being  feet per mile and
difference in elevation to be overcome
 feet whence there is a steady drop
for a distance of  miles with a maxi-
mum grade of  feet per mile from
wadsworth to rocklin  miles the
line is very crooked the maximum curve
being  degrees

   about midway between sacramento and
oakland wharf trains are ferried over
the straits of carquinez-one mile across
-and of course this materially retards
the making of average fast time between
those two points it usually requiring
twenty minutes to take a train- across

   as to the personnel of those who had
to do with the success of the trip the fol-
lowing officials might be mentioned  uni-

mccrea it might be said in passing was
at that time only twenty-eight years of
age but we were then not far from the
civil war period when colonels aged
twenty - five and generals aged thirty
showed they could bear responsibilities

   turning from consideration of the op-
 erating men of that day to those of the
 present time it is indeed notable to what
 an extent the active men of the present
 time were either just commencing their
 railroad careers or were mere youngsters
 at school

   william lee park now general super-
intendent of the union pacific was a
seventeen-year-old brakeman on that road
and j o brinkerhoff a division superin-
tendent was a conductor of the present
southern pacific operating staff practi-
cally only h j small has official railroad
experience dating back to the centennial
year mr small now general superin-
tendent of motive power was then general
foreman for the international and great
northern in texas being a young man
of twenty-seven years

   the pennsylvania staff is notably per-
 manent but even  this system we find
 that but four of the fort wayne men can
 date back thirty-three years or more-
 j j turner now third vice-president in
 charge of the transportation department
 was a telegraph operator aged twenty-
 three  george l peck general manager
 was a train despatcher a mere boy of
 eighteen  charles watts general superin-
 tendent of passenger transportation was a
 passenger trainmaster at logansport in-
 diana  and a m schoyer general su-

love leads john wentworth over a thorny
path until he encounters a big black bear

it

was a trying day for john
wentworth the new school
principal in the little moun-
tain town beyond the rockies
a big unruly nineteen-year-
old youth who had been sent
up for punishment by the lady teacher of
the primary school had been soundly raw-
hided and sent home by him a few min-
utes had elapsed since the incident and
the school was recovering its normal air
when two harsh irregular knocks on the
door made every pupil glance toward it
with a look of expectancy

   come in said the principal as he
continued the rehearsal of his class in
physiology no one entered and the
knocks were repeated in a way that made
the door fairly shake on its hinges with
an air of impatience he walked to the
door and opened it tall rugged and
angry the father of the boy whom he had
whipped stood on the threshold with his
right hand on his hip-pocket

  why haf you mine boy whipped
he growled

   continue your studies and preserve
order until i return said the principal to
his pupils as he went out and closed the
door after him

   this is neither the time nor the way
to see me on this matter mr rhiner he
began with dignity eying his visitor fear-
lessly  in half an hour i shall be at
your service he continued as he walked
through the lobby toward the entrance
followed by rhiner

   i musuhaf it now explained and no
more time-losing was the reply with a
nervous move of the hand in the hip-

pocket

  wentworth

who coolly watched every

move of the enraged man stopped ab-
ruptly thus bringing him within easy
reach

  take your hand from your pocket
mr rhiner i warn you he said sharply

   i vill  was the snapping rejoinder

  wentworths left shot out quickly and
rhiners right arm fell helpless by his
side while an old single-barreled percus-
sion pistol clattered on the floor

  picking it up with a quick movement
wentworth surveyed his would-be slayer
with a gaze that had in it both reproach
and compassion but not a sign of resent-
ment the face of the other fell as it
became tinged with a flush of shame

   come back in half an hour mr
rhiner said wentworth  it is of the
utmost importance that your sons career
should not be endangered by any misun-
derstanding between us at this time take
this with you he added handing the old-
fashioned weapon to the astonished man 
 we shall talk the matter over just as if
nothing had happened

  school was dismissed and rhiner true
to his better nature had a heart-to-heart
talk with the principal on learning that
his boy william had lit a cigarette and
smoked it in the schoolroom in the pres-
ence of the teacher and her eighty pupils
that he had deliberately puffed a cloud of
smoke in her eyes when she attempted to
take it away from him that he was not as
far advanced in his studies as children of
ten and twelve years old and that he was
absolutely without desire to do better the
wrath of the father knew no bounds

  indeed it was only by strong persua-
sion that wentworth prevented him from
returning home forthwith to administer a
sound horsewhipping to his son when




the railroad mans magazine

  it was understood that the principal had
  decided on taking william into his own
  schoolroom the face of the elder rhiner
  fairly beamed with satisfaction

     your own schoolroom  ach i thank
  you meesther ventvorth that iss it-
  your own schoolroom  lash der books in
  at school und i vill lash der bad out at
  home a goot joke on villiam  

     he caught one of the principals hands
  in both of his as he delivered himself of
  these abrupt sentences and laughed till
  the tears ran down his cheeks as he pic-
  tured to himself the dilemma of the scape-
  grace william

     it was about three weeks before this in-
  cident that john wentworth had arrived
  in the town of oval so-called from the
  shape of the mountain basin in which it
  lay that was a critical time in the school
  history of the place as the former prin-
  cipal had resigned in sheer despair in the
  middle of the spring term because of his 
  failure to preserve order as there were 
  r young men of twenty and young women
  as old as twenty-five among the pupils
  discipline was not an easy matter

    wentworth who graduated from an
  eastern university was looking for a suit-
  able town in which to settle and practise
  law saw- in the position an opportunity
  to replenish his funds which were run-
  ning low he had paid his expenses at
  college with money earned by teaching
  and so had a special fitness for the posi-
  tion

     he was about twenty-five years old of
  compact frame muscular and athletic
  his face showed keen intelligence strong
  will power and determination

    when he appeared before the school
  trustees of oval as a candidate they eyed
  him approvingly before they examined
  his testimonials and when they read a
  few- of the latter they were highly pleased
  it was not however until they read a pas-
  sage referring to his prowess as a member
  of the football eleven in the testimonial
  from the president of his college that they
  nudged one another with positive delight
  and flashed to one another in unmistakable
  eye language  hes just our man

    half an hour after the last word was
  spoken to the elder rhiner wentworth
  was climbing the steep hillside overlook-
  ing the town clad in sw-eater and heavy
  walking shoes he had already become a

familiar figure to many who lived miles
from oval at the little cabins of the
miners set in an opening in the forest or
perched high up at the head of a gulch
thousands of feet from the depths below
he loved to call his cheery manner and
unaffected ways won a welcome that was
as refreshing to him as the mountain air

  he took off his cap reverently when he
gained the summit stretching far away
ridge after ridge rose until the last one
faded in cloud and sky-looking like great
inert billows on a vast ocean then a
race down hill on the other side jumpi
ing over fallen trees and mountain streams
as they came in his path

  a deer sprang out of a thicket near
him looked with startled gaze-then
dashed through the chaparral then the
sound of a mans voice fell on his ears
increasing his pace he soon came in sight
of the road leading to blankton which
wound round the hill in corkscrew fash-
ion to overcome the heavy grade

  he heard the voice crying whoa
whoa whoa then after a short in-
terval in alarmed tdnes  look out
trixey  gip will be on top of you whoa
there gip 

  the road directly in front was hidden
by chaparral and while wentworth was
forcing his way through it he heard the
unknown exclaim

   dang the tarnation critter that
jumped into this mess if i could only
git down from here but i dassent leave
the brake whoa jess 

  when wentworth came on the scene
the-odd-looking vehicle-a cross between
a stage-coach and a circus wagon-drawn
by two horses was in imminent danger of
toppling over into the ravine the off
horse was lying on the edge of the slope
and in his efforts to rise he was dragging
his mate nearer the danger-line

  a girl was at the head of the fallen
animal endeavoring to release him from
the harness while a middle-aged woman
stood looking on in helpless fear in the
drivers seat sat a bronzed typical west-
erner holding the brake fast with his leg
while he pulled the rein on the near ani-
mal of the team with a death-grip

  in an instant wentworth was beside
the fallen horse and with a few dexter-
ous slashes from his knife cut him clear
of the harness then by a skilful and
in the grip



muscular effort he succeeded in assisting
the animal to the roadway

  -good boy well done i swan i i
cudnt a done it bettern that myself
stranger was the greeting of the driver
as he shook wentworths hand warmly
 i thank ye kindly for if ye hadnt come
when ye did wagon plates and all would
a been at the bottom of the gulch

   this is my wife and daughter he
said by way of introduction  an if
youll excuse me ill jest go an try to
splice things up a bit

   we are on our way to oval ex-
plained the elder woman after she and
her daughter had in turn thanked went-
worth

   yes and should have been obliged to
walk the remainder of the way had it not
been for your timely service added the
younger  besides we should have lost
our valuable art gallery she added play-
fully

  then seeing the mystified look on
wentworths face she enlightened him
by telling that they were itinerant pho-
tographers on their spring tour of the
mining region with much of their world-
ly goods in the wagon

   papa was thinking more about the
loss of his plates and other effects than of
himself or of us when you caught us in
our predicament she concluded with a
humorously wry countenance

   i fear that i dont merit your thanks
after all said wentworth to the young
lady who was now his only listener her
mother having gone to assist in mending
the broken traces  if i guess aright the
horses were frightened by a deer that i
unfortunately startled

   yes the deer was the cause of it all
but i dont know which was the more
frighteneolthe deer or the horses he
lit in the center of the road a few yards
ahead of them and after mama and i
scrambled out of the wagon i remember
that he still stood trembling as if rooted
to the spot when i rushed to the head
of jess he dashed down the road like a
streak 

   poor fellow i am thankful for your
sakes that he wrought  worse mischief
there is only one thing that i have against
him his lack of good taste in fleeing at
sight of you

  the young lady evidently thought that

the stranger was presuming too much in
paying the compliment on such slight ac-
quaintance for she made  direct reply

    let us see how papa is getting on with
the harness  she said in a matter-of-fact
way as she walked toward the wagon

  wentworth felt the rebuff but did not
show it he quickly replied  it looks
as if lie were ready to start again then
he said earnestly  i must express my
admiration of the coolness you displayed
at the head of that horse jess-miss-
here he stopped for the expected infor-
mation

   our name is thorpe excuse our
rough western ways for overlooking
so necessary an item of introduction
she spoke with perceptibly heightened
color ignoring the tribute paid to her
courage

  but she had met a man who was a mas-
ter of calmness and in her heart she con-
fessed much to herself as he replied with
grace and candor

   our introduction-at the head of that
kicking maddened horse-i shall always
remember miss thorpe the name in
this case was immaterial without the
name of thorpe i should always have re-
membered you as a girl of nerve and cool-
ness in danger my name is wentworth
i am school-principal at oval

  they had reached the wagon by this
time

   papa this gentleman is mr went-
worth school-principal at oval she said

   well if you can handle the young-
sters as well as you do a horse hang me
if they wont turn out to be wonders

   thank heaven i have no desperate
cases mr thorpe he laughingly re-
plied  but now that you are ready for
the road again i shall say good after-
noon here he assisted the ladies into
the vehicle  i am out for my daily
spin he explained as thorpe offered
him a seat in front beside himself

   well oval aint a big place and
youll easily find us mr wentworth he
said as he mounted the box

   do not forget to call  us called
out mrs thorpe as they drove off

   never a word from trixey he said
to himself as he left the highway to
plunge once more into- his beloved for-
ests she had smiled at him as she held
her dainty head out of the window and


the railroad mans magazine

echoed his own  good afternoon but his
heart had a little gnawing pain in it be-
cause she had not joined in her mothers
invitation

  the wild beauty of the mountain sce-
nery appealed in vain to wentworth the
remainder of that afternoon every-
where he looked he seemed to see the face
of the girl whom he had met so strangely
the soft hazel eyes the rich auburn hair
the arch look followed by the bewitching
smile the saucy half-defiant poise of the
head-all came back to him like the inci-
dents of a delightful dream

   trixey - trixey he repeated to
himself  an unworthy name for so fair
an owner must be an outlandish abbre-
viation of beatrice i suppose trixey by
any other name could look no sweeter
bah i really must be getting senti-
mental he said as he abruptly ended the
soliloquy

  next daj his quick-eyed pupils no-
ticed that he indulged in unusual fits of
abstraction that were followed immediate-
ly by enthusiastic work that stirred them
all to better effort even the dullard
william rhiner who required the special
attention of the principal-as he formed
a class in himself-was roused to use his
faculties and lost all sense of time by the
interest he took in the tasks set him in-
deed he went home from school that day
as if he were in a new world - he had
found a pleasure in study and the prin-
cipal had praised his work

  it was not until a week or two had
elapsed that wentworth called on the
thorpes he knew that they had rented
a vacant building which they used both as
art gallery and dwelling and that they
were kept busy attending to a business
that grew larger every day

  it was in the afternoon just after
school dismissed and mr thorpe at the
time was busy in the  dark  room with
his negatives while mrs thorpe was en-
gaged in household duties

  inquiring for miss thorpe he was di-
rected to a room where that young lady
was deftly handling prints in shallow hat
trays she received him with a warmth
of welcome that atoned he thought for
her coldness at their first meeting and ex-
pressed her regret at being obliged to di-
vide her attention between him and her
work

  he noticed with a feeling akin to sor-
row that the tips of the nimble slender
fingers were stained with acid but not a
thought did she bestow on them as she
rinsed this print here or examined that
proof there all the while keeping up a
running conversation in which good sense
and humor prevailed

   i should like to become your pupil
he ventured during a lull occasioned by
her nimble examination of a fresh proof

   i have no doubt you would be an apt
one if the teacher would prove compe-
tent she replied

   there is no doubt whatever on the
latter point miss thorpe the incentive
created by having you for a teacher would
be sufficient alone to make the pupil a
success

   do pupils usually pay compliments
to their teacher  she answered with gen-
tle irony

   they would if they felt the same re-
gard for their teacher that i would have
for mine he said evasively

   which means that the pupil would
establish rules for himself i fear i
should scarcely prove equal to the task of
maintaining discipline and she laughed
while she looked at him with a peculiar
smile

   the teachers word would be law
was the answer in a tone of humility

   that would follow only when the
teacher was firm dont you think this
is a pretty baby she quickly asked by
way of diversion as she held toward him
a print ready for mounting

   yes just like his father he answered
absent-mindedly and her merry laughter
was increased by his own as the ludicrous-
ness of his reply struck him

   by the way miss thorpe there will
be a  sheet and pillow-case ball  at mrs
randalls next week and she sends by me
an invitation to mr and mrs thorpe and
you i hope you will be able to come he
said eagerly  mrs randall lives in
oval about five miles from here and the
drive will be splendid as we have beaxi-
tiful moonlight nights 

   this is so kind of mrs randall-
and of you she said simply with a lin-
gering tone on the  you  that made his
heart beat faster  i shall speak to papa
and mama and have no doubt we can ar-
range to go
in the grip



   your own sheets and pilloav-cases
you know i have never been at a ball of
this kind and expect it will be jolly

   i have never been at one either she
replied  but some of my friends have
and they say it is just immense the
dancers wear their sheets and cases for
a short time only and then appear in
usual dress

   well i shall take it for granted that
you will come and shall arrange ahead
for a good driving team i should like
to staylonger but i feel that  am inter-
fering with your work

   please let me speak for myself mr
wentworth she answered with a pretty
toss of the head  you have not inter-
fered with my work i never allow any
one jo do so consider yourself not
guilty

   thanks then i may come again
with an easier mind  

   with a perfectly easy mind on that
score i am afraid you will soon grow
tired of such dull company

  you shall be the judge was his re-
ply as he pressed her hand before leaving

  trixey often thought of the young man
and honestly liked him she had never
analyzed her feelings toward him in her
heart she stood a little in awe of him al-
though she would never admit it there
was a hidden reserve force about him that
somehow impelled her to treat him differ-
ently from any other man she had met

  the randall ball came off and was
pronounced the most successful socij
event that oval had seen for a long time

  wentworth found himself in a heaven
of delight as he drove miss thorpe to
the randall residence mr and mrs
thorpe having decided not to go at the
last moment if the young lady had only
guessed at wentworths regard for her
before the drive began she was made
fully aware of the depth and intensity of
his love before the journey ended

  the glorious moonlight the giant trees
that threw their soft shadows now and
then across the face of the woman he
loved the great sigh of the mountain
breeze as it swept up from the deep
gulches and played with stray tresses of
her hqir the overpowering sense of lone-
liness without her to fill the void in his
heart and life-all were zealous ministers
in urging him to make a declaration of
 r r

the love that made his unbending will as
subservient as that of a childs

  the horses were walking slowly up the
heavy slope that led to the brow of little
summit when he changed the light com-
monplace conversation with a suddenness
that almost startled his companion

   miss thorpe were you ever in sight
of a great happiness-so close that you
could almost grasp it-and yet felt that
it was so far away you might never gain
it  he asked

   i cannot say that i have she an-
swered musingly not divining his mean-
ing  any great happiness that i have
looked forward to has generally been re-
alized seeing papa and mama again
after a years separation has been the
greatest that i have known

   the saddest thing about the happi-
ness i speak of miss thorpe is that the
hand which alone can bestow it is some-
times powerless to give it

   what an enigma mr wentworth
the hand able to bestow and yet power-
less 

   yes and the owner of the hand in
this case is the dearest best and fairest
on earth to him who humbly craves the
happiness

  as he spoke his eyes glowed and his
face grew pale and showed his strong
emotion her eyes met his and all was
revealed to her in an instant then a
frightened look stole over her face and
she breathed nervously as she leaned back

   i know now what you mean mr
wentworth she said slowly  i am
sorry i never thought that you cared
-that way please do not say any more
it hurts me

  he could see that the drooping lashes
were moist with tears

   and i am a brute dear to think only
of myself rather than have you suffer a
single pang on my account i am willing
to bear the pain alone i have loved you
ever since i first met you and could bear
it no longer and i shall just keep on
loving with the hope that some day-
some day-

  the conversation turned into lighter
channels so skilfully that before they
drove up to the randall farmhouse he had
succeeded in a great measure in restoring
their former relations

  there was however a perceptible re-

                                        i

serve in her manner that did not escape
his keen eyes and he fondly hoped that
the sign was in his favor and not against
him

  when wentworth and miss thorpe ar-
rived they found the farmhouse turned
into a series of dressing-rooms numer-
ous guests awaited their turn to don their
simple garb of white while a constant
stream of white-robed figures passed from
the house to the large barn which had
been turned into a ballroom mrs ran-
dall and a crowd of merry girls at once
seized miss thorpe and bore her away
while wentworth was taken in hand by
several of his friends from oval who had
found the kitchen an excellent retreat in
which to obliterate traces of their iden-
tity

  there he saw william rhiner and oth-
ers of his growing pupils for each of
whom he had a pleasant greeting to
william especially he showed marked
cordiality and that individual looked as
if he felt proud of the distinction

  word was passed that the opening
dance was about to begin and off they
trooped to the barn as he passed through
the door wentworth felt a hand touch
him on the back twice first between the
shoulders downward and then across but
he attached no meaning to the act other
than a frolic of one of the merrymakers

  each masquerader had cut loose holes
for eyes and mouth in the pillow-cases
and the scene in the spacious barn had
a weird unearthly aspect to wentworths
eyes the light from a row of lamps
fixed high on the walls shed a ghostly
glare on the figures the muffled laugh-
ter was the only sound that broke the
almost oppressive silence the stalk-
ing fantoms expressed themselves to one
another wholly in pantomime evidently
fearing that a tone would betray them

  the latter would mean forfeiting the
evenings pleasure in the opinion of a
masker

   then the band-two horns two violins
and a bass viol-struck up and the sten-
torian voice of the caller rang through the
spacious building  take your partners
for the lancers  

  within half a minute the bewildering
mass of over two hundred figures had
paired off and were gliding to the music

  loud above the noise made by the

band the cries of the caller guided many
who were unfamiliar with the dance and
they were especially enthusiastic when he
yelled  swing your partners 

   several times during the masked period
of the ball wentworth thought he had
singled out his sweetheart but always de-
tected some movement or action that
showed he was mistaken then he gave
up the task as hopeless and entered into
the spirit of the occasion with a zest that
was infectious

   just before the last dance was called
he was approached by two figures-they
were girls he was sure-who beckoned
him to follow them as he did so a
masked figure swiftly passed him and
whispered so that he could hear distinct-
ly  be careful and dont sit down

   this appeared very mysterious to went-
worth who continued to follow the pair
to a corner of the room where they sat
down one on each side leaving the angle
vacant for him they motioned him to
the seat and he was about to sit down
when the whispered warning flashed on
him he declined the honor with panto-
mimic gesture he noticed thatan un-
usual number of figures were collected
in the vicinity all standing except the two
who were importuning him to sit down

   at this juncture a tall figure came up
from a distant jart of the room and no-
ticing what he thought to be ungallant
conduct on the part of wentworth took
the vacant seat with abound

  the barn resounded with the wildest
and most surprised yell ever emitted from
mortal throat the victim found himself
in a monster tub of ice-cold water what
looked to be a seat was a trap in the form
of a large tubful of water thin boards
being laid  top and the whole covered
with a liorse-blanket

   the victim of this joke turned out to
be a chicago drummer who had been
invited to the ball by a friend of mrs
randall a business man in oval

  wentworth felt indignant that he
should have been selected for the geat
and was at a loss at first to account for
the ease with which he had been picked
out in the crowd of maskers

   then he recalled the peculiar sensation
experienced as he passed into the build-
ing and at once concluded that the sheet
worn by him had been marked by some
in the grip



one connected with the plot even then
he laughed to himself at the discomfiture
erf the jokers and engaged in the final
mask number on the program with his
former good humor

  at its close after he had conducted his
partner to a seat he immediately left the
barn for the kitchen to satisfy himself
by an inspection of the sheet he removed
it and the pillow-case on his way carry-
ing them over his arm

  a hasty examination in the hallway
showed that the sheet was marked with a
large black cross he heard an angry
voice in the kitchen say

   you spoiled the fun you cur take
that  then the sound of a smacking
blow followed by a cry of rage

  as he gained the threshold of the kitch-
en he saw a crowd of young men most
of them residents of the valley standing
around william rhiner and a big burly
young farmer the latter was pale with
anger and the former held his face in
his hands as if in pain

   what is the matter william  went-
worth asked sharply

   the big coward hit me he landed
on me hard  

   yes and ill hit you again said the
bull as he rushed to make good his
threat but wentworth was between them
in an instant

   not while i am here he said quietly
and firmly

   get out of my way or ill spoil yer
face  and he rushed with bull force at
wentworth who quickly sidestepped and
tripped him up

   remember we are guests of the own-
er of this house there must be no dis-
turbance here wentworth said as the
other regained his feet

   then well have it out in the field
you miserable eastern carpetbagger
ill teach you for puttin in yer nose
where yer not ast

   you are resolved on that was the
reply

  if yer dont ill followyer to the
town and thrash you before yer sleep

    am sorry to do it but  must save
you the trip to town wentworth replied
 not a word to the women about this
he requested as he went out at the heels
of his challenger followed by all in the
room

  the battle was short and bloodless

  the young farmer was as strong as an
ox but ignorant of the rudiments of self-
defense wentworth had been champion
heavy-weight of his college the larger
man rushed and was met by a stiff left
jab on the chin that stopped him and
jarred him to the toes

  wentworth feinted for his adversarys
eye with his left hand his antagonist
threw both hands high up to ward off the
expected blow and the teachers right
delivered with great force a solar plexus
the result furnished wentworth and sev-
eral others ten minutes of hard labor be-
fore the bully was restored to conscious-
ness

  returning to the barn wentworth
found that refreshments were being
served and that no knowledge of the un-
pleasant occurrence in which he had fig-
ured was yet in the possession of the
guests he claimed the honor of a waltz
with his hostess and then sought miss
thorpe whom he found surrounded by a
knot of admirers

  to his mortification she laughingly ac-
knowledged that all the  round  dances
had been promised to others but that the
first square dance would be his just
then the caller announced a quadrille
and wentworth led her off to their place
his face showing happiness at being
granted even this favor while his heart
reproached her for what to him appeared
unkindness if not indifference

  she listened with much amusement as
he told of his fruitless efforts to pick
her out from the crowd of maskers and
his hopes would have risen a hundred-
fold could he have known that her heart
throbbed quicker when she learned that
amid all the gaiety he had not forgotten
her

  it was the only opportunity he had
during the evening to be near her and
he was not at all happy in consequence
but he did net overlook a small feat in
diplomacy that he believed would meet
with her approval he invited two young
ladies of oval to join her and himself
on the homeward trip

  this was the most enjoyable feature of
the evening to him miss thorpe whether
or not to show her appreciation of his
thoughtfulness abandoned herself to the
enjoyment of the hour rare snatches


the railroad mans magazine

of song- rollicking choruses in which
all joined laughter and a rapid fire of
mirthful small talk ended the journey
all too soon

  when he bade her good-night he took
her hand in both of his then yielding
to an overmastering impulse he kissed
her on the mouth

   good night dearest he said with
the boldness of honest love and was gone

  trixey thorpe was too much surprised
to say anything

  she closed the door and went to her
room then she lit the lamp and re-
moved her hat and wrap in a tempest
of emotion her growing indignation
finally found vent in the murmured ex-
clamation 

   how dare he  how dare he  

  after a while she prepared for bed
just before putting out the light she
took up a small mirror and surveyed her
face in it she suddenly touched the
mirror with her lips then kissed the spot
passionately turned out the light and
got into bed

  wentworth whose mind was in a fever
of hope and fear over the parting kiss of
the night before made his customary af-
ternoon call on the thorpes the follow-
ing day mrs thorpe informed him
that trixey had gone out to make a busi-
ness call on one of their patrons the
news made him heartsick again the
second day afterward when he presented
himself at the house he was given a simi-
lar explanation only that it was accom-
panied by regrets from mrs thorpe that
her daughter should have been called
away

  he was now convinced that miss
thorpe avoided him and he discontinued
his visits altogether seeking diversion
from the thoughts that consumed him
by taking longer trips than ever into the
woods and mountains the solitude of
these increased his woes and he tried
study instead

  several times he had been on the verge
of writing and imploring her pardon for
the liberty he had taken but his pride
and the failing that the man who truly
loves a woman can never insult her for-
bade him moreover his loyalty to her
was unshaken and hope-though it was
hope deferred still pictured a rift in the
clouds

  several weeks had elapsed when he re-
ceived an invitation to join a berrying
party that was to make the expedition
into the mountains twelve miles away
the day selected was a school holiday
and he immediately accepted he learned
that miss thorpe was to be one of the
party

  he knew by hearsay that the thorpes
would leave oval in a few days and he
rejoiced that he was given this oppor-
tunity of seeing her once more before bid-
ding her a formal good-by

  he was not fortunate enough to be
one of those who were assigned to the
coaching wagon in which she rode but
he was in the one immediately behind
she smiled kindly at him he thought
as she returned his morning salutation
and once or twice on the journey when
she turned to answer a remark made by
one of his fellow passengers she had
lowered her eyes on encountering his

  on arriving- at the destination lunch-
eon was spread and wentworth contrived
to include miss thorpe among the ladies
on whom he waited his manner was
as cool and buoyant as ever

  the repast finished the members of
the party scattered in little detachments
wentworth attached himself to a party of
five made up by miss thorpe two other
ladies a younger man and himself

  there were several berry - patches in
the vicinity and they chose one that was
high up on the slope where the surface
was rugged berrying is a pastime in
which it is difficult to keep together for
any length of time especially when each
is trying to outdo his neighbor in the ex-
ploration of new treasures

  only once after they had reached the
zone of individual effort did wentworth
come within talking distance of miss
thorpe and then when he attempted
to diminish that distance by a forced
roundabout route she was nowhere in
sight

  he heard the voices of the others be-
low him but failed to find the object
of his search he did not trouble him-
self any further in berrying he was in-
tent on finding this girl with the unim-
pressionable heart and once more trying
to win her

  her course led him higher up thei
mountain and gaining the crest of a
in the grip	

 high cliff he eagerly looked around in
 the hope of catching a glimpse of her
 nothing met his gaze but a waving sea
 of shrubs and clumps of undergrowth
 with here and there a giantfir or pine
 he felt that she was eluding him with a
 purpose he was all the more determined
 to find her

   instinctively he kept working his way
 toward the summit although his judg-
 ment questioned the probability of a
 woman attempting the rigors of a climb
 over the broken and difficult surface
  but she is inscrutable to me in many
 ways and why not in this  he reasoned

-	so lie climbed and zigzagged and wound
 his way until he reached a point which
 showed him that his path was leading
 him into a cul-de-sac a great wall of
 rock rising sheer one hundred feet barred
 all progress in front while the sides
 sloped at a gradient that defied foothold

   he was inwardly blaming himself for
 silencing his better judgment in the selec-
 tion of a course when he was startled
 into violent action by the piercing scream
 of a woman it came from the blind
 gorge his trained ear told him and he
 started for that point at a pace that-
 showed  care for bones

   he had jumped scrambled and rolled
 about half the distance when he heard
 the rushing of some creature through the
 low brush as it approached him

   the next moment a huge black bear
 appeared speeding toward him in a frenzy
 of fear the animal came right in his
 path and wentworth hastily climbed a
 ledge of rock near by knowing that this
 species will not attack a man if free
 course is given him

   the bear rushed past in increasing
 panic and he continued his race in the
 opposite direction

   breathless he reached a point where
 lie could see miss thorpe her dress had
 caught in a bramble she could not get
 herself free she saw the bear coming
 at her and in her terrible fright she
 picked up a stick that was at her feet
 and began to flourish it at the animal

   the bear thought that the girl was
 trying to block his progress as he ap-
 proached her lie rose on his hind legs
 and emitted a growl that pierced went-
 worths heart

   wentworth quickly camc up behind

  the bear stood poised pie seemed to
be calculating with his animal instinct
the real motive of the frightened girl
he approached her with more speed than
seemed possible in such a ponderous ani-
mal  as she fainted he caught her in
his mighty fore legs wentwprth was now
in front of the beast a well directed
blow with a sharp stone either frightened
or stunned him he dropped his beau-
tiful victim and tore on into the under-
brush

  the girl dropped in a heap her life
seemed to have left her only the faint-
est quiver of her lips showed that the
breath was still in her body her lips
turned ashen

  wentworth leaned over her he took
her in his arms he called her name-
he called it again

  she made no reply

  would she never come back to him
there was a tremor of the body the ashy
pallor of the face was changing slowly to
the most delicate pink  the quiver of the
delicate nostrils could barely be detected
as the breath of life was taken in  the
transparent eyelids moved tremulously
the parted lips were ripening with a ruby
glow every sign that harbingered her
coming back to him was hungrily seized
upon by the eyes of the man who loved
her better than his life

  she moaned and he pressed her closer
to his heart the eyelids were raised
with an effort then closed again as if
their burden were too heavy there was
a movement of the arms and again the
eyes opened there was intelligence in
them this time and they rested on john
wentworths face at first in wonderment
then with a winning tenderness she said
with an effort

   i am so glad you found me-john

   trixey dearest i must never never
lose you again it would kill me   the
tension of the arms that held her was in-
creased

   never again john dear never
again she said softly with a sigh of
happy resignation

  then a pair of arms were twined around
his neck hesitatingly as though the ven-
ture were fraught with uncertainty

  the kiss that john wentworth stole
was rapturously seized again by the right-
ful owner
 recent railroad patents

by forrest g smith

the vast network of railroad efficiency and railroad equipment has
been built up by eighty years of such
efforts as these

   we have decided to slightly change the form of our monthly article on railroad
patents and to add another feature for a long time we have been receiving queries from
readers seeking advice about patent procedure and heretofore mr smith has answered these
queries by mail in future we shall run these queries and the answers to them as an appendix to
the monthly article every reader who has a problem of this nature is welcome to the services
of the department and a letter addressed to mr forrest g smith or to the editor will re-
ceive attention as early as possible

noiseless crossing-noise-
less railway crossings are as a rule rather
complicated structures but a decidedly sim-
ple crossing of this class is disclosed in a
patent no  december   issued
to william c peters of harrisburg penn-
sylvania of course the only crossing which
can really be considered as noiseless is one
in which a continuous or unbroken rail sur-
face is provided to the wheels of a train
passing over either track of the crossing

  mr peters has solved the problem of pro-
viding such a rail surface in a crossing and
has embodied his ideas in such a simple de-
vice that it is a wonder that others have not
thought of the same thing before

  his device is something on the order of
the ordinary switch inasmuch as it em-
bodies a short section of rail which is to
be swung from side to side in the frog of
the crossing so as to aline with one rail or
another this rail section is automatically
actuated by the pressure of the car-wheels
as they approach the crossing regardless of
the direction in which the car is traveling
and is so perfect in its action that the only
perceptible sound of car-wheels passing over

it is the usual sound made as they pass over
the meeting ends of two rails

refrigeration-the problem of

preserving fruits and vegetables when
shipped for a long distance is a serious one
and cities distant from our fruit-growing
states can at best have over-ripened or
home fruit and vegetables the quantity of
ice necessary to transport a train-load of
fruit so that it may reach the distant con-
sumer in proper condition is enormous as
compared to the actual cost of the fruit
itself

  to economize in the use of ice and other
refrigerants it has been proposed to pre-
cool the cars after they have been packed
this is usually done by withdrawing air
from one end of the car and replacing it by
air at an appropriate temperature introduced
at the other end of the car

  this system is objectionable in that it does
not replace all of the air in the car promptly
and also because the change of temperature
effected is not gradual or uniform through-
out the car goods of this character are


recent railroad patents



injured by sudden reduction in temperature
and in a car-load are naturally unevenly
subjected to the change	

  to overcome the objectionable features of
such a system of precooling arthur faget
of san francisco california has secured
a patent no  november  
his method while similar in general prin-
ciples contemplates that air be not only in-
troduced at points distant from that at which
it is withdrawn but at various other points
more or less nearer he point of exhaust
and that the pipes for admitting the cooling-
air be directed at various angles so as to
equally treat the cargo

  by this method the entire car-load of
goods upon arriving at its destination will
have an even market value as all portions
of it will be in the same condition

automatic stop-a device for

automatically stopping trains when they are
run past a danger signal which differs ma-
terially from those heretofore considered is
disclosed in patent no  december
  issued to william j sosecne of
emeryville cal ordinarily such stopping
systems are so arranged that air-brake set-
ting devices within the engine cab are actu-
ated by a trip arranged beside the track

  locating thejxip in this position however
renders it liable to be disturbed or tampered
with furthermore in such systems as
previously constructed the air-brakes have
been applied not only fully but suddenly
which is decidedly disadvantageous

  in the system disclosed by mr soseene
the trip for actuating the mechanism on the
engine is in the nature of an arm which is
mounted out of reach upon the usual sema-
phore pole and is connected directly with
the semaphore further the air-brake set-
ting means upon the engine is so arranged
that the brakes will be gradually applied



double controller-it has

long been customary to attach to a  motor-
car  a  trailer  that is not equipped with
motors in this arrangement the motor-car
must be equipped with motors of sufficient
power or number to propel both cars thus
more or less unfitting the motor-car for use
as a single unit

  in modern systems however conditions
arise that render it advantageous to operate
cars as either single or double units for
example during the  rush  hours or in
times of great temporary increase of passen-
ger traffic it becomes necessary to substan-
tially increase the carrying capacity although
it may not be possible to correspondingly in-
crease the working force

   this result could be secured if two ordi-
nary motor-cars could be coupled together
and operated from a single controller this
is exactly what is contemplated in patent
no  november   issued o
arthur b stitzer of philadelphia penn-
sylvania

   in this system of control each of the two
cars to be coupled is provided with a special-
ly constructed controller either at one end
or at both ends the controllers are so
connected in the same circuit that any one
of them may be used to control the motors
of both cars

   as a result the propelling force applied
to the cars may be varied at the will of the
motorman according to traffic conditions
another advantage of this system lies in
the fact that should one of the motors burn
out another may be thrown into use in-
stantly without the necessity of waiting for
aid from another car- as is now customary

a new spike -it is seldom that
patents  railroad spikes attract interest
but one covered by patent no  de-
cember   issued to james t nulty of
philadelphia pennsylvania is so novel and
possesses such advantages that it cannot pass
without notice and commendation it is a
spike which serves two purposes and serves
them both well instead of locating the head
of the spike at the upper end of the shank
mr nulty forms it at the middle of the
shank

   the head is similar to the ordinary spike
head and when the lower portion of the
shank is driven into a tie the head will
engage and hold the base flange of a rail as
does the ordinary spike head the  upper
story  of the spike so to speak now per-
forms its function by being bent or driven
in toward the rail until its upper end bears
against the underside of the rail tread

   thus the spike not only serves to hold the
rail in place upon the tie but also serves to
brace the rail against turning over such a
spike will be decidedly advantageous 
curves and at other danger points

controlled car-doors

-in that class of railway cars of the  easy
access type considerable confusion occurs
if the passengers themselves have to open
the doors to place the doors under the
control of a guard or conductor and to per-
mit all of the doors being opened simul-
taneously is the aim of an invention shown
in patent no  december   is-
sued to peter m kling of pittsburgh penn-
sylvania


the railroad mans magazine

  the car devised by mr kling is of the
usual type mentioned above but the doors of
his car arc connected at their upper and
lower edges by bars which cause them to
move in unison an arm is connected to
one of the doors and is actuated from the
piston of an air-cylinder

  by the slight movement of a lever in one
direction or the other the guard can admit
air to either end of the cylinder and simul-
taneously open or close both doors

novel street-car-a novel

construction of street railway car is shown
in patent no  october   issued
to edward a barber of york pennsylvania
mr barber aims to provide a closed com-
partment for the motorman of the car which
will not interfere with the entrance and exit
of passengers and to so arrange the doors
closing this compartment and the entrance
to the car proper that neither door will
interfere with the other

  the compartment for the motorman is to
the right when facing the front of the car
and is divided from the platform proper
by a short partition and a door which latter
is hinged at one side of the doorway or
entrance to the car proper

  the door which closes the entrance to
the car proper is hinged at the same side of
the said doorway and while the doors may
be independently swung upon their hinges
means is provided for automatically connect-
ing them so that they may be swung to-
gether to open or close either doorway while
they may be independently swung to close
or open either or botli doorways

  as a result in the summer months the
motormans door may be left open as well
as the doorway to the car proper whereas
in the winter months the motorman-s door
may remain closed while passengers enter or

leave the car this construction will pro-
tect the motormen and provide comfortable
temperature conditions within the car

none killed in ten years

george a cullen g p a of the

delaware lackawanna and western
railroad sent the following communication
to the new york times recently we gladly
reprint it in the railroad mans maga-
zine and as the times suggests we will
gladly publish any record that matches it
mr cullen writes

   from time to time recently you have re-
ferred to the published statements of certain
railroad companies with respect to their en-
viable records of safety during the last fiscal
year

  your readers will be interested to learn

that during the entire decade jan  
to jan   not one passenger has been
killed as the result of a train accident on the
lackawanna railroad during this period
of ten years this road has transported -
 passengers each passenger has been
transported an average of  miles

   the number of miles run by passenger
trains during this time amounts to s
which is equal to operating  separate
trains all the way from new york to san
francisco or a daily train service across the
continent continuously for over fifty-four
years
millions for railroad trifles

by t s dayt on 

when  companys money  is a vague and boundless something to be
squandered in careless extravagance supplies are ordered chiefly on
the theory that it is good for trade when business was booming
and prosperity stalked through the land all the railroads were lavish in their
purchasing departments but when the panic of  came the railroads felt
that this generous policy could not be a running mate with solvency a care-
ful and exhaustive system sprang up among them as a result of this warning
and now railroad housekeeping is one of the highest developed branches of
the science of railroading

anybody can see the big leaks but it takes an expenditure com-
mittee to discover the little ones for -it is through
them the profits disappear

                   	miles of lead-
pencils  boxes of
pens  barrels of ink
hi m  pounds of pins-
these are what the em-
ployees of the average
-mile railroad use in a twelve-
month the railroads keep a strict guard
nowadays on the consumption of even
these trifling articles they are econo-
mizing in everything especially by stop-
ping the numberless tiny leaks in their
expenditures that in the aggregate mount
up into millions

  the pennsylvania railroad for in-
stance spent  in  for rubber
bands-just the ordinary kind that you
slip around folded sheets of paper in
 the pennsylvania employees had all
the rubber bands they needed but the

supply cost about  less largely
because they were used more carefully

  the greatest businesses in america-
the railroads-are to-day realizing more
than ever that their profits lie to a great
extent in their economies anybody can
see the big leaks it is the little ones that
the expenditure committees are now re-
lentlessly hunting out

  nearly every large line in the country
now has such a committee generally con-
sisting of several of the high executive
officers whose task it is to see that ex-
penses are kept down to the lowest notch
without impairing efficiency in the mat-
ter of supplies of all sorts their instruc-
tions to the department heads run sub-
stantially like this  you can have what-
ever you need but you must see that it is
used economically




the railroad mans magazine

  in no better way could the enormous
possibilities of waste and consequent loss
on the railroads be better shown than by
telling the amount of material and sup-
plies that they buy each year there are
several roads that consume more than
 worth annually

a ten-million cut

  there are at least nine railways that
buy from  to 
twenty-nine roads buy from  to
 each and more than a hun-
dred railroads purchase from  to
 worth of material and sup-
plies every twelvemonth

  the aggregate spent annually in this
way does not fall far short of the stupen-
dous total of  from this
it will be seen what this great movement
toward the economical utilization of ma-
terial is likely to mean

waste with prosperity

  during the past few prosperous years
when the roads had all and sometimes
more business than they could handle
they were lavish in their purchases of
everything from stationery to steam-en-
gines business was booming and the
requisitions on the storekeeper were often
generously large owing principally to
every one being too busy to give them
careful and judicious scrutiny and to the
human failing that goes with a full
pocket

  every one was so rushed with work that
there was not time to fix up tools or sup-
plies when they got the least bit out of
order into the scrap-heap they went

  now every requisition is having the
acid test applied to it by numerous emi-
nent experts before it gets to the expen-
diture committee and after the goods are
bought and issued they do not get into
the scrap-dock until they are absolutely
used up beyond repair and cannot be uti-
lized for any other purpose

a sure welcome

  on a big system the penny wastings
run into thousands of dollars every year
the present movement inaugurated by
the executive heads runs down through

every department until even the humblest
employee is enthusiastically doing his best
to help

  there is no more welcome caller in the
office of any head of department-or even
in that of the president himself-than the
man who has a new and practical idea of
how the road can save money

  one of the principal tasks of the ex-
penditure committee is the scrutiny of
requisitions for supplies the lists of
requisitionscome in from the purchasing-
agent showing the number and kind of
each article wanted the price and the
name of the firm from whom it will be
purchased

  the statistics on file as to the quantity
of each item in stock and its monthly or
annual consumption in the past are con-
sulted as well as the prices hitherto paid
for it if everything is o k it goes
through the comlnittees every doubt
however has to be cleared away before
it is passed

  the necessity of using the utmost care
and judgment is so strictly impressed on
every one from the bottom to the top now- 
adays however that most of the paring
down of requirements is done before the
requisition is finally submitted to the com-
mittee

 microscope for the president

  another part of their work is the thor-
ough and searching scrutiny of all ac-
counts covering expenditures outside of
the purchase of supplies these accounts
are carefully analyzed before being pre-
sented and comparisons are made so that
their  true inwardness  may be seen at a
glance

  not even the presidents expense ac-
count escapes the most rigid examination
and the corijimissary account of the presi-
dents private car is no less submitted to
the deadly parallel of comparison than
that of any of his subordinates

  nothing is too small to escape one
big trunk line spent some time making ex-
haustive experiments with pencil - sharp-
eners in order to find out which was the
best and most economical

  the way these little things are wasted
is not so strange when one comes to look
closely into it take rubber bands for
instance some roads used to buy these in
millions for railroad trifles



pound boxes and issue them in that way
to the various departments

  when a clerk wanted any he would
grab a handful and put them in the
drawer of his desk some to be used and
the rest to gradually get mixed up with
papers and slip out of sight or into the
waste-basket shortly necessitating an-
other trip andanother handful

  other roads supplied each size in a
separate  box which resulted in nearly
every clerk who used rubber bands hav-
ing a number of boxes in his desk at the
same time now the practise is to fur-
nish them in ounce boxes of assorted sizes
and to keep watch that no undue accumu-
lation ensues throughout the office

leaking millions in cents

  it used to be the case that any one
could get from the clerk in charge of the
supplies in each office half a dozen lead-
pencils at a time if he wished  and if his
fancy required a particular kind of pencil
it was forthcoming now the clerks get
their pencils one at a time and have to be
careful of them a still greater economy
-a saving of from  to  a
year on a good-sized road-is now effected
by every one using the same kind and
grade of american pencil

   pens are also dealt out just as carefully
-one or two at a time instead of by the
box-and these too have been standard-
ized and their cost cut in half the pins
the big railroads are using now are made
of steel instead of brass and cost but
one-quarter of what they used to

   vast quantities of letter-heads are used
by a big railroad for there is a lot of cor-
respondence passing to and fro contin-
ually the day of the engraved letter-
head and of bond paper has practically
passed since these economies have been
instituted that kind of stationery is still
supplied to some of the high executives
but they restrict its use to letters ad-
dressed to people outside the company

  the cheapest serviceable paper is what
is used in company correspondence most
roads are also vigorously urging the cur-
tailing of letter-writing and urging the
asking of as many questions as possible
verbally

   this is to eliminate the writing of let-
ters to the man at the next desk  in order

to get a record of it as used to be the
custom a hundred thousand dollars a
year is a moderate estimate of the saving
in this item alone aside from the time
taken in dictating reading and signing
letters

clipping the station-agent

  station-agents used to have generous
supplies of stationery enough to last them
two or three years in some cases now
there are several men who travel over each
road checking up and shipping back any
surplus stock a thirty-days supply is
now the maximum allowed on some roads

  on a big system made up of a num-
ber of different lines there has been a
vigorous movement to standardize all sup-
plies and to bulk the purchases take the
item of way-bills for example such a
system uses perhaps twenty million way-
bills a year

  they are now printed on paper of a
uniform quality and ordered through one
purchasing-agent thus saving from -

	to  a year over what they cost
when each line used a different form and
had them printed separately by stand-
ardizing railroad tickets and mileage
books one eastern trunk line is now sav-
ing over  a year in its printing
bills

  as an example of how much can be
saved in the supplies furnished to gen-
eral offices alone it will be only necessary
to cite the case of the pennsylvania in
 that roads general office expenses
were  economy and care cut
this about  during 

  ninety per cent of the operating mate-
rial and supplies that a railroad purchases
finally reaches the scrap-bins that
means that material originally costing
 when it is more orjess worn
out is  scrapped that is where one of
the greatest wastes or the greatest econo-
mies of a railroad lies lately nothing
has been more closely watched

reducing the scrap-heap

   into the scrap-heap at last goes every
bit of metal from lanterns to locomotives
one of the big eastern trunk lines re-
ceives about  a year from the
sale of this scrap metal in the old days


the railroad mans magazine

it -was customary to offer it to buyers as so
many ton of  miscellaneous scrap

  the dealers bought and sorted it them-
selves frequently realizing enormous
profits from so doing they speculated
on the quantity of each kind of the va-
rious materials each lot would contain
now the speculative element is eliminated
for the railroads do their own sorting

  it will surprise most people to learn
that there are ninety-eight different kinds
of scrap according to the classification
the railroads adopted in  and each
kind takes a different price it is in the
rigidness of the inspection however that
the railroads have been saving money of
late

   before the scrap is offered for sale now
it is inspected by no less than four differ-
ent mechanical experts everything that
it is possible to utilize either by repairing
or in some other way is picked out

  twisted or bent rods are straightened
so that they can be used again if they
are broken they are cut up into bolts
even the old bolts themselves are re-
threaded

  nothing that can be used over again by
repairing without decreasing its effi-
ciency or taking up too much time is al-
lowed to go into the scrap to be sold
the result is that while the amount of
scrap disposed of is less in tonnage it
brings in the aggregate more than it did
owing to its being so carefully sorted into
the many different classes

  further the material reclaimed owing
to the rigid inspection and used over
again on a big road runs into ah enor-
mous value-how much of a saving none
of the roads have been able to figure accu-
rately owing to the lack of any standard
of prices for seqond-hand material but on
a large system it must be several millions
a year

from brooms to locomotives

  even bridge-stringers and cross-ties
are turned to account after their original
usefulness lias passed the former are
now used for crossing-planks and all
kinds of repairing purposes and the lat-
ter are sold for firewood

  another paring down in expense is be-
ing made by standardizing everything
from lead-pencils to locomotives stand-

  ardizing which means using the same
type or pattern of each article throughout
an entire system is not a new thing by
any means  but it has never been carried
to such an extent as it has during the past
two years

  take it in the unconsidered item of
tools for cleaning cars stations and of-
fices the santa fe system recently an-
nounced that it uses annually about -

	brooms  hand-mops 
scrubbing-brushes and  boxes of
soap

  the brooms mops and scrubbing-
brushes are each of the same type and kind
all over the line and the soap is all of
one quality this is true of nearly every
other large railroad in the united states

  the economical principle is obvious

	brooms of the same pattern cost
less than that number in six different de-
signs

comparisons of cost

  in brooms and scrubbing-brushes as
well as in the vaster items of consump-
tion the standard has not been decided
upon until after long and exhaustive
tests have been made statistics are be-
ing amplified to show what ties have the
longest life and give the least trouble
from spiking

   from the records of the spikes the de-
sign requiring the least renewals and
working the least injury to the ties is de-
termined from the records of fire-boxes
the designs and character of sheets giving
longest life and best service per unit of
first cost and repairs are learned

   from the fuel records the value of dif-
ferent kinds of coal are known and a rec-
ord of performance as to tonnage and
mileage is at hand as between various
classes of engines and enginc-crews and
so it goes all through the list every-
thing is being most carefully supervised
and watched in the most systematic way
that can be devised

   of course the vast masses of compara-
tive statistics necessary for these economy
committees cost a great deal of money
also the army of supervisors whose duty
it is to be continually on the watch against
waste but it is already apparent that the
cost of saving these millions is infinitesi-
mal compared with the huge result
watch for the gleaming eye

by al herron
detective for the wabash railroad

various schemes are used by railroad detectives in landing a quarry
frequently the man who is being hunted is either so heavily disguised
or so elusive in his habits that he can make a get-away without any
trouble it takes some particular personal fault or trait of his to finally get
him in the meshes of the law al herron generlly manages to land his
man by the eyes but he had several very remarkable encounters while look-
ing for eyes	

the unique method used by an old wabash detective in success-
fully running down some of the men who
attacked the road

etective work has been
  reduced to such a system
  these days that the old
  maxim  it takes a thief
  to catch a thief has no
  place in our category

  the chief requisite is honesty next
persistence watchfulness patience last-
ly and always courage nerve nerve

  there isnt so much romance in real
detective work as is generally supposed
candidly i was attracted by this alleged
romance i didnt find out my mistake
until i had learned a new profession

  although a railroad detectives life is
mostly occupied with the serious problem
of criminology he frequently runs across
many humorous incidents

  all detectives have met with their fail-
ure cases if a detective has not-well
he isnt a detective a detective denying
that truth is an utter stranger to veracity

  i have met and overtaken a lot of
crooked people during my thirty - odd
years of duty as a detective-private and
professional railroad and otherwise-yet
i do not claim to be a great criminal-
hunter

  i	have been successful because ive
made a study of crime and have not trust-

  ed so much to luck as some detectives
notwithstanding luck does indeed play an
important part in a detectives life any
good detective who has made a study of
criminal types cannot only recognize the
traits of the type but he can if the
chances are not altogether unfavorable
catch his man and prove him a criminal

  i	always remember a man by his eyes
if i once get a square look at a mans
eyes i would recognize him if i met him
anywhere the face is always changing
the eyes never change

  a man without strongly marked fea-
tures can deceive the shrewdest detectives
if the latter have not made a study of the
eyes there are men whose faces are
completely changed by shaving off a mus-
tache  even a weeks growth of beard
and a change of clothing will disguise
some men

  there are other men who look like
tramps with a three days stubble on their
faces a change from a stiff hat to a
soft hat completely alters some but if
you have noted their eyes you cannot
mistake them

  every profession stamps its imprint
on the eyes if you notice closely you
will observe that the eyes of the merchant




the railroad mans magazine

differ from those of the lawyer the eyes
of the day laborer from those of the
skilled railroad mechanic

  next to the eyes i note the walk of
men a criminal cannot walk like an
honest man indeed i can almost tell
a thief by listening to his footsteps

  perhaps my quickest deduction in ap-

this time a chicago man was appointed
superintendent of a branch of the wabash
that had suffered a recent attack pre-
sumably by this same train-agent and i
too began my connection with the same
railroad

it was only a few days after our ap-
pointment we were at headquarters in

prehending a thief was in the case of one
throxton durgan who had dropped into
the habit of robbing trains on several of
the roads running into st louis this
was many years ago it appeared that
one man was doing it all in his very
boldness lay the secret of his success

  it was his custom to get on a train con-
duct himself in a modest almost chester-
fieldian manner and when the proper
time came jump up with a pistol and
demand money the detectives were
baffled the sheriff went after the fellow
and came home with two ounces of lead
in his system

  an old man who had been known as
the leader of a ku-klux band went into
the swamp after the train-robber and
since then one  of his eyes has been per-
manently closed

  things went on until the governor of
missouri desired to be showrn he issued
a proclamation offering a reward but
the robber was not caught just about

st louis when a man called upon the
superintendent

   my dear sir he said  i owe your
road ninety-eight cents

twas an odd debt

   i dont know about that replied the
superintendent while we both looked at
the stranger rather sharply  but if
you do nows the time to pay what is
it for 

  its an odd debt i agree but im
honest i am and therefore must pay i
came in on your road this morning from

l- i dropped off to sleep a few

minutes after boarding the train and the
conductor neglected to collect my fare
so you see i decided to come here and
pay off heres a dollar

  i	was struck by the mans eyes i
said nothing but began to make my sher-
lockholmesian deductions

 what  exclaimed the superintend-

in his very boldness lay the secret of his success
watch for the gleaming eye



ent  you had a chance to beat a railroad
company and didnt do it

  the man started to reply but i inter-
rupted by accusing him of being too hon-
est gently informed him that he was
throxton durgan the train bandit and
placed him under arrest

  the same day when confronted with
evidence he confessed he was the robber
wanted

  a peculiar incident happened to a
brother detective brock wilson and my-
self just five weeks prior to my con-
nection with the wabash

  it was when the notorious winthrop
weston the kansas city train robber
made his escape and was presumed to
have flown to st louis receiving word
that weston was hiding in a barn in the
outskirts of the city we started for the
place and were informed that he could
be found in the hay-loft wilson who
was a single man volunteered to go up
first

the eyes in the loft

   you stay down there he said to
mfe  because you have a family and i
have not

  wilson made his way to the hay-loft
and in the darkness caught the sight
of two eyes which he supposed were
the train robbers

   winthrop weston   he yelled  i
dont want to take any chances with you
give vourself up or ill shoot-shoot
to kill

  the eyes stared at wilson for a few
seconds then suddenly he saw them
move and they appeared at another cor-
ner but weston did not open his mouth
there was the same stare and the gleam-
ing eyes but not a sound

  wilson again asked for a surrender
and receiving no reply fired to his
surprise the eyes disappeared but there
was no cry of pain wilson made his
way slowly up to the place where he had
seen the eyes gleam and struck a match

  imagine his surprise when instead of
the train robber he found a cat in the
last throes of death he had hit the
animal square below the eyes i came
up just as he pulled the cat out of the
hay

  while i was associated with brock
wilson we succeeded in capturing for

the wabash railroad a pass forger
named burns whose operations involved
railroads all over the country

  he had been systematically securing
passes from railroads by means of forged
requests purporting to have been issued
by the officials of various roads

  the applications were always filled
out on blanks which appeared to be
regular and stamps and signatures were
well counterfeited transportation would
invariably be issued and sent to burns
various aliases were used but he always
received the passes which it is alleged
he sold to ticket brokers

  they were altered before they were
used and when taken up their owner-
ship could not be traced by the railroads

  burnss arrest was partly the result of
information sent to the chief of the
western passenger association he said
that a man giving his name as o h
morton and giving his address on west
monroe street chicago had been using
letters of recommendation on the rail-
road company which he had sent to the
general superintendent of the wabash
asking for transportation

  these he said purported to bear the
superintendents signature which was a
forgery the association instructed the
chief to take extreme measures to arrest
the man wilson and i were detailed on
the case with promise of an additional
reward outside of our regular salary if
we succeeded in landing the crook

  we learned that morton whose cor-
rect name was burns had been receiving
his mail at the monroe street address
there burns met a young woman who
wanted to return to her home in fort
wayne indiana but did not have suffi-
cient money she added that she desired
to go via logansport and thence on the
wabash to fort wayne

just ask me

   oh i can pass you over any line
you wish said burns

  you can said the woman she
was somewhat surprised that he did not
present the appearance of a prosperous
railroad man

   why lie assured her  if you want
a pass just ask me i can get it for you
ary time


the railroad mans magazine

instead of a train robber he found a cat

   burns asked her to hold any mail that
 might come addressed to o h morton
 and one day he called to see if there
 were any letters for him

  we traced him to twenty-second and
state streets where he was reported
to be living at twenty-second street
and wabash avenue we were told that a
man answering burnss description was
in a house in the next block we went
there and arrested burns

caught with the goods

  in his room was a satchel containing
the papers used by various railroad com-
panies in official correspondence dies
stamps inks and all the necessary ma-
terials to forge railroad tickets

  there was also a supply of blank
traveling cards issued by the american
railway union and by almost every
other railroad labor organization in the
country

  burnss operations were found to be
more extensive than at first supposed the
die-maker and the printer who bad fur-
nished burns with the letter - heads and
stamps found in his possession were lo-
cated but they had ne knowledge of
the purposes to which they were put

  the imitations -of the letter-heacfs
stamps and membership cards were ex-
ceptionally good he was tried con-
victed and sentenced

the limits of engine building

the past year has shown continued increase beyond what was
the supposed size

the most surprising fact in railroad de-
velopment during  was the con-
tinued and very considerable increase in the
size of passenger and freight locomotives
so marked has this been that we have ceased
to hear anything of late about the  limits
of size having been surely reached

  the adoption of the mallet articulated sys-
tem has made this increase possible two
locomotives built by the baldwin company
may be quoted as instances of this construc-
tion a freight locomotive for the moun-
tain division of the southern pacific rail-
way built a few months ago has  square
feet of heating surface the engine weighs
 tons and the engine and tender together
weigh just under  tons

  toward the close of the year the same
company built for the atchison topeka and

santa fe railway a still larger locomotive
with  square feet of heating surface and
 square feet of superheating and reheat-
ing surface the engine alone weighs t
tons engine and tender together  tons

  the most novel and important departure
in the new passenger engines of the year is
a huge mallet -wheel locomotive with
two high-pressure -inch cylinders driving
six coupled -inch wheels and two -inch
low-pressure cylinders driving four coupled
-inch wheels

  the total heating surface is  square
feet and there are  square feet of super-
heatingand reheating surface the engine
weighs s tons and the engine and tender
together  tons such an engine will be
able to haul the exceedingly heavy express
trains at a high rate of speed

          there was real trouble when dutchy damrosch
          got the lunch-counter rights at dry notch

e was known as dutchy but
his name was damrosch
he started railroading as
cooks helper on a con-
struction-gang that was
laying track across the
prairie as the mileage grew so dutchy
grew at first lank and lean he took on
little by little the appearance of being
comfortably nourished until by the time
they hit the rockies dutchys gait had
become a waddle and his innocent blue
eyes were almost hidden by the great rolls
of fat that puffed out his face like a toy
balloon

  then dutchy slow ofbody and like-
wise of brain and yearning for a quiet
and peaceful existence secured the lunch-
counter rights for dry notch now dry
notch half-way across the prairie con-
sisted of a water-tank a small roundhouse
a smaller station and a diminutive general
store but because of its geographical po-
sition it was headquarters for the mid-
plains division

 rr

  brett was superintendent in those days
thornley was master mechanic and
macdonald chief despatcher with the
railroad hands and train-crews they com-
prised the population of dry notch un-
less there might be added a few ranchers
somewhere in the neighborhood the
staff bunked in a room over the station
and the men had their quarters in the
roundhouse but one and all they ate at
dutchys counter sinkers and coffee
apple pie and sandwiches they stood as a
steady diet for a month after he had ap-
peared upon the scene and then a delega-
tion waited upon him and demanded dish-
es more substantial

   you can make meat pies and chicken
stew and all that sort of thing cant
you they demanded

   sure  said dutchy  but dot iss
oxpensive

  money was no object they assured him
and thereupon proceeded to fix a schedule
of prices-fifteen cents for a meat pie
twenty cents for a dhicken stew-with


the railroad mans magazine

two slices of bread and butter thrown in
for good measure

veil said dutchy  so iss it

  and a few nights later true to his
promise they got out their chicken stew-
canned chicken stew

  the huge pot full to the brim had
been emptied and dutchy his face beam-
ing with smiles had bustled into the back
room for a further supply when mac-
donalds voice rose plaintively

   its-its chicken isnt it 

  the crowd looked inquiringly at the
despatcher

   because went on macdonald soft-
ly  i-i never heard of any chickens in
dry notch

  and then amid the laughter that en-
sued thornley rose dramatically from
his seat and picking up a bone from his
plate waved it aloft

   gentlemen this is no time for
mirth  he cried  we are the victims
of a swindle we are in the clutch of an
octopus-that is to say a food trust com-
posed of dutchy and the dining-car con-
ductors of nos  and  it is my pain-
ful duty to assert that i recognize this
bone as the identical bone on which i fed
two nights ago coming up the line on
no 

  dutchy entered staggering under the
load of the replenished pot when thorn-
ley solemnly demanded a rebate on the
spot

   vat iss it  said dutchy halting and
peering anxiously into the pot then evi-
dently reassured that no essential ingre-
dient had been forgotten he looked up at
the ring of faces that were regarding him
with grave inquiry  vat iss a repate 
he demanded  it something iss mit der
bread und butter for twenty cents to go
yess 

  the crowd roared and up and down
the division train - crews engine - crews
and section-gangs got the joke and passed
it on until the lunch-counter became
known to every man on the system as
the rebate

  they did not explain the joke to
dutchy and for days he endured the chaff
stolidly though with much bewilderment
until one afternoon macdonald patient-
ly and ploddingly acquainted him with
the unhallowed baseness of one thornley
-helping himself by way of compensa-

tion to the heap of doughnuts under the
glass cover

  dutchy listened his cheeks getting red
der and redder as macdonald exagger-
ating some hundredfold suavely rubbed
it in

   dot thornley iss-iss a pig  shout-
ed dutchy suddenly as the light burst in
upon him

  macdonald nodded assent his mouth
too full of doughnut to speak

  und i a fool iss yess continued
the proprietor pounding a fat fist on the
counter

  again macdonald nodded smiling
sweetly-and reached for another doughs
nut

  but this time dutcliys fingers were
firmly clasped around the cover and he
peered suspiciously through the glass at
the number of doughnuts remaining then
glared at the despatcher

you-you git out from here he
said slowly but with rising emphasis 

  and macdonald chuckling went

  it was not until after supper that same
evening when no  pulled in that
dutchy made any move toward retribu-
tion-then dutchy cut loose it was tag-
gart who got it-little shorty taggart
the driver of no  who was red-haired
and an inveterate joker and likewise a
great crony with thornley

  the first intimation -macdonald had
that anything was up was an enraged
howl that rising above the tumult of the
station reached him where he sat in the
despatchers office there was no mis-
taking that voice-it was dutchys he
stuck his head hastily out of the window
while thornley who was in the room
leaned over his shoulder

  dutchy was bellowing like a mad bull

 say it slnisht say it oh py gollv 

  here followed a volcanic eruption of
guttural german with one or two words
common to all languages intermingled

  then flying through the doorway of
the luncli-room dashing down the plat-
form scattering loungers passengers and
car-tinks in all directions in a mad rush
for the engine end of the train tore a
short figure in tight-fitting bandy-legged
overalls whose flaming red hair present-
ed a shining mark for the plate that
whizzed past his ear aud smashed into a
hundred pieces against a baggage-truck
the rebate



  and dutchy blowing hard his sleeves
rolled up over the fat of his arms wad-
dled to the center of the platform and
shook a frantic fist after the retreating
engineer

   la fool iss no longer yet clond it 
he screamed and puffing his cheeks in
alid out like a wheezy injector he re-
turned reentered the restaurant and the
door closed behind him with a resounding
bang

   you bet  said macdonald elo-
quently when he could get his breath

   the door opened and brett the super
came in

   dye see taggart and dutchy
brett cried thornley

-v-



presented a shining mark for
the plate that whizzed
past his ear

 yes said brett laughing then
more seriously  look here youd bet-
ter patch it up with dutchy theres no
use rubbing it in too hard macdonald
tell blaney to put my car on no  when
she comes in im going east to-night

the patching however was quite a
different matter than talking about it

the next morning the lunch-room door
was ominously closed-and the staff went
breakfastless by listening at the keyhole
and from an occasional glimpse through
the window they knew that dutchy was
inside

   rut to pleadings threats and door-
kickings the occupant was to all intents
and purposes oblivious things began to

 macdonald drew in his head and the
tears were running down his cheeks as he
held his sides

  thornley groped for a chair

   guess taggart was asking for a re-
bate he gasped  it was worth pay to
see him run


the railroad mans magazine

look serious for the staff station and
shop hands who were wont to depend on
dutchy for their grub-stakes

  thornley whistled softly and pulled
at his pipe his feet on the despatchers
desk

   hell have to open up when no 
pulls in thornley was saying more by
way of reassuring himself than of pre-
senting any new view of the case to mac-
donald  the company wont stand for
any inconvenience to the passengers-that
is he hastened to amend  not of this
kind what theyve got a sort of lien
on that joint and if he waits for them to
get after him hell get into trouble wish
brett were back-hed make him open up
quick i guess whats the matter with
no  anyhow thought you said she
was on time  

   so she is said macdonald grin-
ning  hear her 

  from the eastward came the hoarse
shriek from the whistle of a five-hundred
class

   guess ill go down said thornley
 coming 

  macdonald nodded and got up from
his chair the two men reached the plat-
form in time to acknowledge a flirt of the
hand from sanders in the cab as the big
machine wheel-tires sparking from the
tight-set brakes rolled slowly past them
coining to a halt farther on

  simultaneously the door of the lunch-
room swung wide open and on the
threshold completely filling the opening
with liis bulk stood dutchy in his left
hand he held his bell which he began to
ring clamorously in-his right hand al-
most but not quite concealed behind his
apron was no less a weapon than a sub-
stantial-looking rolling-pin a crowd of
passengers began to surge toward the res-
taurant and among them mingled the
hungry railroad men of dry notch

   come on  shouted thornley exult-
antly  i knew hed have to open up
heres where we feed-hm 

  vait cried dutchy imperiously as
the head of the column reached him
 you yess you no vat iss it  he
was sorting the sheep from the goats al-
lowing the passengers to enter pushing
the railroaders ruthlessly to one side

  you yess ou no you yess you
-oh  py golly 

  he had caught sight of thornley and
swinging suddenly struck out viciously in
that direction with the rolling-pin being
obliged to maintain his position in the
doorway the strategic key to the situation
the jab fell short by two or three inches
barely missing thornleys nose

  thornley fell back instinctively

  look here you old ass lie yelled
angrily  weve had about enough of this
its past a joke the companys got a
lien on that joint of yours and well close
it up so tight youll never open it again-
dye hear 

  dutchy stopped short in the monoto-
nous  you yess you no on which he
had recommenced and his paunch began
to shake  yah   he cried  dot iss
a joke oh py golly lean dot iss ven
you starving get yah  ho ho  ha ha i 

  in dutchys burst of merriment first
one and then another joined until een
thornley his good nature getting the bet-
ter of him roared with the rest at his own
expense

  but if this apparent return to good hu-
mor on dutchys part inspired any hope
in the minds of the railroad men that lie
had relented and that former friendly re-
lations were to be resumed they were
doomed to disappointment for dutchy
stolidly continued to allow the passengers
to go in and as stolidly barred the en-
trance to the others

  then they gave it up and bought out
the slender stock of canned goods and
biscuits from the shelves of the general
store

  they messed in the baggage-room and
they swallowed their scanty portions to
the tune of  die wacht am rliein bel-
lowed out by a strong and sonorous voice
through the partition on the other side of
which laid out in tempting confusion
as they were painfully aware was plenty

  what they had however did little more
than whet their appetites and by three
oclock some of the men were talking of
carrying the position by storm helping
themselves and doing a few fancy stunts
with dutchy

   we cant have any row said thorn-
ley pulling at his mustache and staring
at macdonald  what had we better
do the boysll be pulling the old shack
down around his ears hell fight like
blazes and some onell get hurt and
the rebate	

 then the companyll want to know whats
 what say the old dutchman has got us
 where he wants us sure-eh what 

   macdonald nodded

    ill tell you what it is thornley
 went on impressively  theres
 some one besides dutchy in
 this theyve been giving him
 a steer-and id give a few to
 know who it is its mighty
 queer dutchy ud wake up so
 suddenly to the fact that he
 was a joke then there isnt
 enough to that rebate josh to
 make him so sore some ones
 been stringing him good and
 plentv what had we bet-
 ter do 

    i dont know macdon-
 ald answered  lets go and
 see if we cant talk him over

   at the sight of the master
 mechanic and the despatcher
 heading for the lunch-room the trainmen
 and station-hands fell in behind them

   macdonald halted a few paces from
 the door you boys stay here he
 directed  let me see what i can do
 thornley and the men halted obedient-
 ly while macdonald went on and knocked
 at the door there was no response

    dut-mr damrosch   he called

  its macdonald i want to talk to
 you

   this time his knock was answered and
 so suddenly as to cause him to jump back
 in surprise

    veil vat iss it  demanded dutch
 scowling belligerently

   were - were -  stammered mac-
 donald his confidence a little shaken at
 the proprietors attitude then desper-
 ately oh i say confound it all
 dutchy were hungry

    so   dutchys exclamation was a
 world of innocent astonishment and kind-
 ly interest

    yes went on macdonald diplo-
 matically  you bet we are its been a
 good joke but youve had the best end of
 it lets call it quits theres a good
 fellow and-and give us all a hand-out
 dutchy listened attentively to the ap-
 peal  i a fool iss  longer yet dont
 it   he queried softly

    you most decidedly are not mac-
 donald assured him

     you vill for repates no longer ask
 yet persisted mr damrosch

    not on your life replied the de-
 spatcher earnestly beginning to see day-
 light  thats all off well apologize

peered suspiciously through the glass at
the number of doughnuts remaining

 too if you like i promise you we are
 quite willing to apologize

     veil den announced mr damrosch
  ve vill aggravate and he slammed the
 door in macdonalds face

     oh hold on dutchy  cried mac-
 donald piteously for he was very hungry
  what did you say 

  vat i said iss dot ve vill aggravate 
 shouted dutchy from the other side of the
 door dot iss english dont it ag-
 gravate  

  he means arbitrate prompted thorn-
 ley from the platform

 oh all right said macdonald
  well agree to that dutchy come 
 -open up  

  i vill not mit you aggra-arra-do it


the railroad mans magazine

-hang dot vord  dutchy asserted de-
cisively but again opening the door
 but mit mister brett i vill do it

  	but mr brett isnt here you know
that retorted macdonald beginning to
get exasperated  and whats more he
wont be back until the day after to-
morrow  guess you know that too
dont you 

  dutchy smiled a patient chiding smile
 dot iss too bad he remarked regret-
fully  but dot thornley a pig iss und
you-oh py golly you-i could not you
pelief ve vill vait for mister brett

  he was closing the door again when
macdonald put his foot against the jam

and leaning toward dutchy said quickly
in an undertone

   look here dutchy youre going too
far if i couldnt see any farther than
you id wear glasses nows the time to
nuke your deal ill help you-see you
can get anything out of the boys now
but you push them too far and theyll
pull the whole outfit down over your ears
you say what you want and ill get it
for vou

  dutchy looked meditatively into mac-
donalds face and shook his head with
a sad smile of wisdom  i vould nor in
you pelief he repeated

   you dont have to you dont have
to believe anybody whatever you want
us to do well do before you let us in to
eat you cant lose what do you say 
mr damroscli scratched his head pen-
sively without taking his eyes off the
despatcher after a minute he tapped
macdonald on the shoulder  veil he
announced  i vill tell you listen
macdonald listened - incredulously
then he whistled a low long drawn-out
note of consternation

   wellyouve got a nerve
he gasped  what do you
think eh the boysll
never- he stopped sud-
denly a smile came over his
face and he chuckled softly
to himself  dutchy youre
great itll be meat for the
boys to make thornley stand
for it thats what you want
to do-make thornley stand
for it will the boys make
him oh will they give
them the chance thats the
way to handle it i told you
id help you now make
your spiel

  macdonald turned to the
group on the platform
 dutchyll arbitrate he
cried

  at this the men began to
push forward but dutchy
stopped them  vait as you
iss ven der-der-hang dot
word-iss den iss it vait 
they waited and dutchy
began to count on his fingers
 dere iss sixteen dot break-
fasted didnd   he began
 dot-iss-iss-

    average em up at a quarter apiece
prompted macdonald in a whisper
 that makes four dollars

   iss four dollars-yess went on
dutchy veil i vant dot

even dutchy was a little shaken

yess veil i vant dot dot iss four
und two und four dot iss ten dollars-
dond it veil i vant dot und den you
come in-yess one py one-j-for a quarter

  then amid the storm of abuse and
jeers that greeted dutchys ultimatum
macdonald with a final injunction to the
proprietor to stand by his guns turned
and joined thornley and the men and on
his face was the expression of one who
has fought in vain for his friends

  veil py golly screamed dutchy
above the din vat iss it who vas
der commencer of dot joke dot isg ten
dollars to pay it iss dot thornley 

   why you wretched old thief yelled
thornley  do you think were going to
pay you for grub we didnt get because
you wouldnt let us have it and then pay
you for it again when you do dole it out
well see you further first

   it vas agreed in front of der-hang

dollars iss dere iss no repate oh py
golly mister thornley dot vas an oxpen-
sive joke-yess dot vas your joke und
i shusht thought me dot i hope you vill
pay dot yourself

  thornley paid with no good grace
but because as macdonald had said they
would the men made him disgruntled
and angry he led the file into the res-
taurant placing  in dutchys hand
before he crossed the threshold

  behind him followed macdonald and
the grinning line of men eaeli contribu-
ting their quarters-in advance-for the
first square meal they had had that day

   eat vat you like said dutchy-
thornley glared  eat vat you like 
lie mimicked savagely  i like your co-
lossal generosity at my expense  

  for a long time there was  other
noise save the rattle of dishes and the
busy clatter of knives forks and spoons
then thornley beckoned to dutchy

  veil vat iss it inquired the pro-
prietor from behind the counter

   who put you on to this  demanded
thornley  ive had to stand for it and
id like to know i would that 

  macdonald sitting beside thornley
noticed with some misgivings a peculiar
expression sweep over dutchys face but
to his relief the proprietors only reply
was a grunt as he answered the call for
more coffee

   by the hokey ill bet it was that red-
haired taggart  exclaimed thornley
suddenly turning to the despatcher

  macdonald buried his face in his cup
ostensibly to drain the last drop then he
set i down quickly and jerked his watch
from his pocket holy moses he
ejaculated and fied from the room

  an hour later dutchy stuck in his head
and beckoned to the despatcher mac-
donald walked across the floor and joined
him dutchy pu-hed him out of the room
and closed the door

   dere iss one thing dot i forgotted

did announced mr damrosch

  whats that inquired macdonald
 dere iss five doughnuts dot iss paid
for not

   oh   said macdonald

   dot vas der time you told dot it vas
thornley-yes dot vas von dollar py
each veil i vant dot-yess 
really laughed macdonald well
i guess not

   dot-vas-der-time -dutchy was
raising his voice each word growing
louder and more distinct than the pre-
ceding one thornleys chair inside
creaked ominously macdonald glanced
furtively toward the door and his face
grew red- you-told-dot- 

  with a hasty movement macdonald
clapped one hand over dutchys mouth
and with the other thrust a five-dollar bill
into his fingers  get out  he choked
and shoved dutchy violently toward the
stairs

  what did the old fool want de-
manded thornley as macdonald stepped
back into the room

  the despatcher made  answer busy-
ing himself over the key

   mac said thornley after a minute
 you wait till i get hold of that red-
haired taggart and see-

   oh shut up  said macdonald

baggage-car

if the casual reader thinks that a baggage-agents life is a weary dreary
shifting of trunks from day to day he must not miss this story for it
tells of a life that is filled with excitement and intense with odd happen-
ings there is no such thing as monotony connected with the baggage
hustlers happy lot

    little wonder then that a man close to his ninetieth year and in good
health and spirits who has spent sixty years in railroading and forty-three of
those years in a baggage-car should be able to spin such a yarn as this and
little wonder too that he would rather sit on a trunk than in the finest arm-
chair ever made

an old agent who had an encounter with a corpse chased trunk-
charmers by night traveled with dickens and spencer and fre-
quently carried as much as  on his person

                                            from the window and with a far-away
                                            look in his eyes seated himself on his
                                            trunk-an ancient ponderous piece of fur-
                                            niture that occupied a large share of the
                                            room

                                             his name was paintedon it-andrew
                                           r leport  dont bother about giving
                                           me the chair he protested  i usually
                                           sit here chairs dont agree with me
                                           ive been too long in a baggage-car id
                                           be there yet if it wasnt for a little run-in

                                                  i had with a conductor a year and a half
                                                  ago

                                                      after that an officer of the company
                                                   came to me and said theyd discovered i
                                                   was pretty near eighty-six years old and
                                                   it was about time i quit running on trains
                                                   so now theyve got me over there in the
                                                   baggage-room though there isnt any rea--
                                                   son for it except this new-fangled idea
                                                   that a man isnt worth much when he gets
                                                   along toward ninety

                                                    sixty years but it dont seem that
                                              long sometimes its hard to realize that
                                              its more than a few months since jim
                                              

trunks trunks its al-
ways the trunks

the old man stood in
the window of his little
room in a west street
hotel and looked over to
the chambers street station of the erie
from which load after load of baggage
was leing wheeled across the wide stretch
of asphalt

 sixty years ive been on the railroad
and forty-three of em ive spent with the
trunks im eighty-seven years old now
and im still handling em and i guess
ill die with em you see im never
more than a stones throw away from em

 in working hours im over there in
the baggage-room and the rest of the
time you can always find me here in this
hotel where ive been living off and 
since before most of the people around
here were born id feel kind of lost if
i ever got out of sight or hearing of the
baggage end of the railroad

 sixty years  he turned slowly
fortyithree years in the baggage-car	

fisk used to come strutting around with
his big cane bossing everybody

   yet do you know sir of all the men
i worked and chummed with back in the
fifties and sixties theres not one living
to-day theyve all gone into the ghost
country there was one who hung on
for a long long time he was pretty
near as old as i was though he wouldnt
admit it

the little coffins

   considering all ive been through
its a wonder im not dead too ive
been in wrecks and ive been snowed up
for days in blizzards and ive risked my
life in a dozen different ways we were
running round a curve between deposit
and hancock one night at something
like seventy miles an hour when six cars
were thrown from the track and went
rolling down into the frozen delaware
river - all but my baggage-
car and the engine

  how it ever came about
so luckily i never could un-
derstand there wasnt one
of all the passengers killed
or badly hurt but i must
have gone up to the roof of
the car and back again two or
three times before i stopped

it was the worst shaking up
i ever got

    but i dont figure that as
the closest shave  ever had
by a good deal i guess the
biggest risk i ever took was
with four coffins and i
didnt have to take it either

i did it just because i couldnt
bear to see a woman cry

  it was back in the early
seventies at binghamton a
young couple met the train
and they had with them four
pine boxes which they wanted
to put on the baggage-car

i knew what was inside of
em at a glance-coffins lit-
tle childrens coffins

   just then somebody came
out of the station and said to
me  these children died up
in massachusetts of scarlet-
fever and the coroner has

ordered them to be buried at once you
take them on this train at your peril i
warn you youll be liable to arrest

   i took a look at the mother she was
young and pretty the tears were roll-
ing down her cheeks and she began to
wring her hands and tell me she didnt
want her children buried among stran-
gers-that shed set her heart on having
them put in the family plot near her old
home in attica

   that was too much for me i said
 arrest or no arrest those coffin will go
on the baggage-car  

   and they did but maybe i wasnt
a scared man between there and attica
scarlet-fever was killing off people by
scores in those days and a mans hair
would pretty near stand on end at the
mere mention of it

   i shoved those boxes as far as i
could get em to one end and i squeezed
up as far as i could get in the other end

chairs dont agree with me ive been too long
in a baggage-car


the railroad mans magazine

and all the way to attica i imagined i
could feel the symptoms coming on

   if id had any money to leave id
have made my will right then and there
but i guess there were some others scared
besides me that whole train-crew
turned mad as wet hens when they found
out what was aboard though they didnt
dare come within swearing range of me
or the baggage-car for a week

   thats a thing a man couldnt do in
these days but i was glad i wasable
to do it then at least i was glad after
all the danger was over manys the time
ive thought of that little woman with
the tears in her eyes and wringing her
hands and pleading with me to help her
have her children buried at home

the sleeping corpse

   it doesnt take a baggageman long to
get used to having coffins around him
manys the night ive slept on one with-
out a quiver but there was one night
that i got a scare and a bad one

   i was alone as usual and the car was
closed tight as a drum for it was snowing
outside and very cold

   about ten oclock i stretched out on
a coffin and pretty soon was asleep how
longi slept i dont know but id come
out into a sort of a half doze when i
heard the most awful ghastly groan you
can imagine

  it seemed to come from right under
me and if my hair ever rose on end i
guess it did then i was too petrified to
move any minute i expected to feel the
corpse banging the boards under me try-
ing to get out

    id heard of supposed dead people in
trances coming to life and  was sure this
was one of those cases but by thunder
if he was coming to life i didnt want to
be with him not alone in that baggage-
car im not superstitious and ive got
an ordinarily good nerve but that was too
much for me

   i managed to get enough of a grip on
myself to jump up then i made a dive
for the door but stopped i knew the
boys would have the laugh  me and
that i wouldnt hear the last of it for a
year- if i ran out to them with my story
so i waited a while

   i knew that the man couldnt get out

of that pine box even if he managed to
break through the coffin for the boards
were thick and were screwed down fast
my nerve began to come back to me and
 stepped up to it and listened

   i heard the groan again and i made
a spring for the trunk that was just be-
hind it between that and the wall
wedged in tight was an old tramp sound
asleep when nobody was looking he
had squeezed his way into the car

meeting a maniac

   that brings back to me another night
when there was a man behind the trunks
and a good deal more dangerous one than
that tramp we had a party of very rich
passengers- aboard who had just returned
from europe and they had a lot of swell-
looking trunks with em

   there must have been a good many
very costly things inside of em and there
were no end of thieves in those days who
were looking for just such trunks bag-
gage - charmers these men were called
they made a lot of trouble for the rail-
roads

   about midnight we were running
through a very lonely country of thick
woods outside it was as black as your
hat no moon no stars just the dark
line of trees was all that was in sight i
was fussing around with the baggage
looking it over and studying the pasters
on the trunks from europe some funny
foreign label caught my eye and i
stooped quickly over to one side to look
at it just as i stooped-bang a big
piece of timber had shot past my head
grazed my arm and splintered on the
floor

   i turned around in a flash not five
feet away from me was a regular giant
with as bad a face as i ever saw he was
just raising his club for another whack at
me and if he had ever landed it would
have been the last id ever have seen of
this world

   turn me loose

   i jumped back and pulled out my re-
volver i always traveled armed in those
days and so did the rest of the baggage-
agents for a man never knew just what
was going to happen on a night run i
fortyathree years in the baggage-car



had him covered before he could make a
move and then i backed away to a trunk
and kept the gun on him for at least half
an hour till we got to the next town

   all the way he was begging and
pleading for me to turn him loose and
telling me about his wife and children
wliod die of starvation if he went to
prison but i said  you didnt think
about my wife and children when you
tried to brain me and i guess i wont
think about yours

   not that ive ever had children or a
wife either but neither had he as it
turned out we turned him over to the
police when we ran into the station and
they were glad to get him for he had a
record

   those baggage-charmers got away
with goods worth a good many thousands
of dollars their favorite scheme was to
steal passengers checks and claim their
trunks at the other end

   one day there were two girls on the
train and two baggage thieves got into
conversation with them they induced
the girls to let them carry their checks
and when i saw what was going on i
stepped up and said  ladies those men
you are with are thieves

    it didnt take a minute for those lads

to disappear but they had the girls checks
with em we blocked their game by wir-
ing on to the other end those checks
never were presented but we arranged it
so that the girls got their trunks

the baggage-charmers

   one gang used to break into the
freight-cars and when they reached a fa-
vorable spot on the line they would throw
off whatever they wanted in bingham-
ton they had two women confederates
who ran a store for the sale of the stolen
goods they made a barrel of money be-
fore detective brown who was famous on
the erie at that time rounded them all up
and sent them to prison

   i used to meet a good many famous
men in those old days i remember
charles dickens once took a look in at
the baggage-car he traveled with a lot
of baggage too herbert spencer was
another englishman i met i knew hen-
ry ward beecher well he used to like
nothing better than riding in the baggage-
car

   but it was long before my baggage-
car days that i began life on the railroad
in  i left the farm in sussex coun-
ty new jersey where i was born and

she didnt want her children buried among strangers


the railroad mans magazine

started in on the erie as a bridge-builder

i was at that about a year and then i
turned to car-repairing in  they
made me station-agent at bergen new
jersey and that is where i spent two of
the most interesting years of my life ber-
gen was the terminal for all the cattle-
trains and i used to meet many of the
biggest cattlemen of the country

a human bank

   i had to collecf the money for their
freight and that was the hardest part of
the work in those two years i took in
more than  and almost all of
it was in money i didnt often take
checks it was too risky i took a check
for  once even though i was sus-
picious of it at the time  hurried over

to our assistant treasurer with it and told
him to get it into the new york bank the
very first thing in the morning i was
afraid the man would get his cattle away
and that the check would turn out to be
worthless

   the next day i was sent up to twen-
ty-third street to settle with a man whose
hogs had been lost overboard and i
didnt get back to the assistant treasurer
until evening

    did you present that check   i said

   he jumped up about two feet he
had forgotten all about it

  well i said your forgetfulness
has cost the road just five thousand
dollars if theres anything in my suspi-
cions for  had already learned that
the man had got his cattle away and had
sold em in the market

 sure enough the check came
back from the bank unpaid then
i hurried up to the bank myself
and saw the president he said

 that man has some money here
but not enough to meet all the
checks that have come in how-
ever theres  to his account
and i think well stretch a point
in your favor and cash the check

cuntfon

i had him covered before he could make a move
fortysthree years in the baggage-car



   but i went out of that bank swear-
ing id never take another check from a
cattleman

   that job at bergen was the most wor-
risome one i ever had there were all
kinds of money in circulation it was be-
fore the days when the federal govern-
ment stood behind a banks greenbacks
there was a lot of counterfeit money too
the man who preceded me as station-
agent there had been stuck with  in
worthless currency and no matter how
careful i couldnt help taking in a little
bad money now and then

   sometimes i would take in 
in a day and i could have gone three or
four days without turning in a cent and
the road wouldnt have said a word if
i had chosen to be dishonest i could have
got away with  very easily often
i used to go to the hotel where i lived
and spend the night with thousands of
dollars in my coat-pocket

   one particularly busy day a gang of
thieves hung around the station watching
me i knew some of them by reputation
and i knew they were men who would stop
at nothing when evening came i had
 in my clothes and there was a
lonely mile between the station and my
hotel i was alone and the thieves were
hovering around pretty close i expected
any minute that they would come for me

and i think they were getting ready when
i heard the cincinnati express coming
down the track

   i ran out flagged it and jumped
aboard before the thieves could make up
their minds what to do

   but the job was too risky for me i
quit in  and went to owego to take
charge of the car-repairers and later of
the wrecking-crew

   when the civil war broke out with
a lot of other railroad men i went to the
front with the eighty-second new york
volunteers we were at antietam and
at gettysburg we were in the left center
where none but the veterans were placed

   we were with the men who withstood
picketts famous charge only eighty-
two of the three hundred and eighty-four
men in our regiment came out alive

   after the war i came back to the erie
as baggage-agent that was in  at
first i ran between new york and buf-
falo then between new york and dun-
kirk and later between new york and
salamanca it was most all night-work
and i was glad of it the nights suit me
better than the days

  well im here-at last in this little
room and all the others are dead some-
times i wish id married and settled down
and had some children around me but
i guess i was always too busy for that

 water-power in europe

their figures small compared with our estimates but they know

what they have

at this time when engineers are just

-	beginning to awake to the possibilities
of power provided for them by a prodigal
nature by the simple law that causes water
to run dovvn-liill statistics of water-power
are of peculiar interest in no country in
the world has nature been so generous in
this matter as in our own land

  the vast resources of the country in this
field have been only approximately estimated
but even our scant knowledge of them runs
into more  horse-power  figures than the
mind can grasp in europe however wheth-
er because of the comparative smallness of
the task or because of their further develop-

ment along lines of conservation the water-
power  available is pretty accurately tabu-
lated

 according to herr koehn says the elec-
trical engineer of london england the
available hydraulic power of europe is dis-
tributed as follows austria 
horse-power france  germany
 great britain  italy
 norway  sweden -
 switzerland  russia and the
balkan slates which are among the districts
left out of the above list also possess great
possibilities which are as yet unknown and
consequently undeveloped

also some headache cure in the form of solutions
to previous problems

              the engine-whistle puzzle we published in the october number
              reminded r de s b of roseburg oregon of a good one

                      there are four queries in it to how many of them can you
               give the right answer 

                   smith who is a good jumper is braking on a freight-train run-
               ning thirty miles an hour or forty-four feet a second he stands upon
               a flat car and for exercise leaps vertically into the air his feet leaving
               the car-deck for say one second does the car slide from under him
               while lie is in the air or does he alight on the spot from which he
               took off

                   -if	the latter why

                    -if	the former how much behind the  take off  does he alight

                    -does	the speed of the train make any difference 

                   -would	it make any difference if smith performed his stunt in
               the aisle of a closed passenger-coach 

                    the answer to this puzzle will appear in our april issue

answers to previous brain teasers

                    the puzzles that we have been publishing from time to time dur-
                ing the past four or five months have been attracting so nxich attention
                that we have decided to publish the answers to them in as many cases
                as possible we are using the solutions given by the propounders of the
                puzzles but in some cases the replies are sent in by our readers

                  to the problem in the october number there were many lengthy


the railroad mans brain teasers



scientific solutions but the gist of the thing is briefly expressed by the
reader who claims that ten seconds are lost by sound-waves  packing
up  in approaching and  stretching out  in receding in no case
does the listener hear the true tone of the whistle

the answer to mr j r conways puzzles given in the novem-
ber number are as follows no -engines move on table with noses
together turn table one-half east-bound engine backs off table
and caboose of east - bound train is drawn on west - bound engine
moving over to the other side of the table turn table one-half turn
west-bound engine and east-bound caboose move off table east-
bound engine and west-bound caboose move on turn table one-half
turn east-bound engine moves oft table and east-bound caboose is
pushed on table west-bound caboose moving over to the other side
turn table one-half turn run engines back couple up and proceed

    the answer to problem  of mr conways is no  meets four-
teen no s

    in the december number there were three puzzles the answer
to no  is if the wheels are on the rail and rotate as a rolling body
the upper portion moves faster than the part which touches the rail
any point in the driver will describe a cycloid curve as the driver rolls
on a plane surface if the drivers are rotated without touching the
rail all parts of the periphery will move around their axes with the
same velocity

    the propounder of no  gives as the solution that the link will
stand the strain of two engines of equal power pulling it in opposite
directions each to the limit of the links capacity

    the answer to the first problem in the january number is

    the man rode four miles and walked one mile

    the answer to no  in the february number is

    the spot on the driver does not travel any farther than the spot
on the pony truck-wheel

    answer to no   the drivers made  revolutions in ten miles

    answer to no  the conductor had fifteen cars eight cars
which is one-half and half a car over of the total he put on track 
four cars which is one-half and half a car over the remainder he put
on track  two cars which is one half and half a car over of the
remainder he put on track  one car he put on track

daughter of the idol

by john mack stone

                   ruth turns a good trick but
                   welch turns a better one

synopsis of previous chapters

roland burke is a young boy sight-seeing in san francisco during a visit to his
uncle richard engle a famous explorer while standing on the dock he is
alarmed by a crowd of struggling men rushing down the street evidently pursued by the
police and in his astonishment is hustled into the boat for which they are making one
of the men who is struggling with the others is kidnaped onto a vessel and roland
though unobserved is also unable to escape the ship puts out defying the forts on
the boat lie is discovered by ruth holland whp also appears to be there against her will
and who seems quite familiar with richard engle though there is some misunderstanding
between them in her cabin ruth is annoyed by a mdn named welch who seems to have
some power among the cutthroats engle interposes

    captain hawson interferes against the persecution of engle by welch and welch
shows his power by deposing the captain and making him a prisoner the captain joins
forces with engle the boy and miss holland they attempt to recover the ship

    they are captured again but the captain manages to communicate with a united
states cruiser by means of a wireless apparatus in a secret alcove in his cabin he then
puzzles the mutineers by hiding miss holland in the alcove

    during various attempts to capture them on the part of welch and attempts to get
possession of the ship by the captain they near the island

      chapter xix
      we reach the island

ot a man stood on the for-
  ward deck many of the
  crew were aft however
  huddled at the head of the
  companionway welch and
  uncle dick and the
  spokesman in the midst of them

   theyll not harm your uncle ro-
land the captain told me  he is
doomed to die a certain sort of death for
having stolen the great aitu and it is as
much as the lives of these men are worth
not to deliver him to the island safe and
sound in body but we want to tr-y to
get him with us so we can put up a fight
when the island is reached every hour
we delay them increases our chances of
rescue for every hour the cruiser is rush-
ing toward the island at top speed

   what can we do  ruth asked dry-
ing her eyes

   if nothing else we can wait for the
night and make an attempt to rescue
him captain hawson replied

  it was past noon then with the ex-
ception that all the men remained aft
there was nothing about the ship to de-
note anything unusual she continued
plowing her way through the sea making
good time

  now and then welch appeared 
deck aft to issue orders he was almost
on the point of collapse the spokes-
man was the real skipper of the steamer

  uncle dick was taken below and we
supposed placed in a cabin under heavy
guard the afternoon passed slowly but
finally the sun neared the horizon

  we had not been molested and had
molested no one ruth spoke of uncle
dick continually anxious to have him
rescued before we reached the island she

began in the november  railroad mans magazine single copies  cents

es
the daughter of the idol



made no secret of her love for him the
tropical night came quickly as tropical
nights always do but it was bright moon-
light and we could see easily every square
foot of space  the forward deck there
was little danger of the men creeping up
on us-unawares

  the hours passed and still we hud-
dled together up near the bowsprit
no one came near us but we knew that
from aft there were keen eyes watching
carefully to see that we did not make
an attempt at leaving our place of
security

   we can never rescue him ruth
holland said a hundred times

   not in this bright moonlight the
captain replied  it would be folly to
make the attempt we should get sep-
arated and would then be entirely at their
mercy

   are we going to give him up to
death without making an attempt to save
him  she asked

   there is always a chance to make an
attempt the captain said if not to-
night then in the morning we can per-
haps save him even after the island is
reached when they start to take him
from the ship there will be a chance

  the morning broke bright and clear
and away to starboard was an island out-
lined against the sky

   that is the island the captain said

 i saw ruth shudder perhaps at
thought of what she had already witnessed
there the men swarmed to the deck
and watched the distant land some of
them were chanting all jabbering to each
other in their peculiar tongue

  welch was on deck early two of the
men supporting him while we watched
the crew carried bolts of cloth from be-
low and began decorating the ship

  great golden streamers were thrown
from the rigging and hung over the sides
gigantic devices emblematic of the great
aitu were fastened in conspicuous places
an awning was spread aft and three
large chairs fastened to the deck beneath
it and a carpet of gold cloth spread from
the chairs to the side of the ship

  we could see the land plainly now
could see a tiny harbor directly before
us the steamers siren began screech-
ing and on shore a great column of
smoke shot into the air

     r r

  ruth was staring at the land as one
dazed i was wondering what the fu-
ture held in store for us captain haw-
son had his eyes upon the deck watching
everything that was done he was wait-
ing for a chance to attempt a rescue of
uncle dick

  when we entered the mouth of the har-
bor a fleet of small boats put out from the
shore and made their way swiftly toward
us their occupants cheering and waving
their arms the town was of white huts
against a background of tropical green
and in the center was a building larger
than the rest

   that is their temple ruth said to
me  it is a temple of horrors

  the steamers siren was still screech-
ing anchor was dropped a short dis-
tance from the shore and the crew al-
though remaining aft crowded to the rail
and answered the cheers of those in the
small boats

  then a barge gaily decorated put out
from the shore and the small boats made
way for it as it slowly approached the
steamer in it were men dressed in gold-
en robes

   the high priest and the others from
the temple ruth said

  the greetings were profuse as the
barge reached the steamers side and the
priests came on deck they walked
majestically across the golden carpet to
the chairs beneath the awning and while
three of them sat down in the chairs
the others grouped themselves behind
them

  the one in the center whom ruth had
designated as the high priest said some-
thing to one of the others and after a
time welch was led up from below where
he had gone when the barge set out from
the shore he too was dressed in a
golden robe and was still supported by
two of the men although the conversa-
tion from this time was carried on in the
language of the islanders  received the
gist of it from captain iiawson and
uncle dick who understood it perfectly
the wind carried their words to us

   you have succeeded noble one  the
high priest demanded

   the great god aitu whom we all wor-
ship has been regained for his people
welch -replied

  the other priests began a chant and


the railroad mans magazine

when it had been ended the high priest
spoke again

   and the man who defiled the god
and the temple what of him 

   we have him in our custody

   and the woman decreed to become
your wife

   she is also aboard ship

   where is the ships commander we
must thank him for aiding in this great
work

  welch tottered and would wave fallen
had not the men held him up

  what is your malady noble one
the high priest asked

   most high priest of the temple
welch said  i am suffering from a gun-
shot wound when we were a few days
from the land where the aitu was found
i scented treachery

   the commander of this ship was
listening to the words of the man doomed
to death for stealing the aitu he was
about to allow the doomed one to es-
cape and for such an act was to receive
much money

   i overheard their conversation and
rebuked the commander of the ship he
attempted to thwart me i was obliged
to take charge of the vessel and to make
her commander a prisoner

   he then began a warfare many of
our men have been shot by the captain
and the others time after time we out-
witted them and time after time they
outwitted us

   but you have conquered in the end 
 the man engle is below a prisoner
in a cabin the captain the woman
and a boy who smuggled aboard are en-
trenched forward and will have to be dis-
lodged the boy is under sentence for
he has touched the aitu  

   he has touched the aitu  the priest
thundered

   it was impossible to prevent it
worthy master but he shall pay with
his life

   aye he shall that  the high priest
answered  you have done well noble
one and honors await you but the
woman-what of her

   she began the betrothal ceremony and
would not finish it

   then she too must die

   she has another chance under the
law

   yes one more chance

   what are your commands worthy
master  welch asked

   you are sorely wounded you must
be taken ashore with all honor and re-
ceive medical attention the aitu must
be returned to the temple with all cere-
monies the condemned ones must be
taken there for judgment i have spoken
the high priest arose the others
grouped themselves behind him and with
the spokesman and welch leading the
way they went below to the aitu soon
we heard them chanting and after a time
the priests came on deck again carrying
the great aitu with much difficulty

  it took half an hour to lower it into
the barge for none could touch it except
the priests then the barge started for
the shore and the people in the small
boats and on the beach screamed in ap-
plause while weird music drifted to us
across the water of the harbor

  we saw the barge landed saw the
crowd driven back saw the great aitu
taken ashore and placed on a pedestal
there with priests to guard it then
half a dozen barges put out toward the
ship again filled with armed men

   they are coming to take us the
captain said

  when the barges reached the ship
half of them were unloaded and the fa-
natics swarmed to the deck aft and stood
there waiting for orders the high priest
sat in the chair beneath the awning again
uncle dick was brought up from below
and stood before him

   defiler of the temple- the high
priest began

   i defiled no temple  said uncle
dick  i did not touch your aitu look
nearer your throne for the one who de-
spoiled you 

   silence  the high priest cried
 these things are to be decided anew
before final judgment is passed

   i bent over to the captain

    shoot their high priest i said  and
in the excitement uncle dick may be able
to reach us

   shoot their high priest and we are
dead people in a minute  ruth said
quickly  there is no way to rescue
him now perhaps-on the shore-

  she stopped speaking and we looked
aft again uncle dick was taken over
the daughter of the idol



the side and placed in one of the barges
and it went some distance from the ship
and remained there a boat-load of armed
men guarding it

   seize the others  we heard the high
priest command

  i thought i saw a smile on welchs
pale face as he looked toward us and
then went to the side and was lowered
into another barge

   i wish i dared put another bullet in
him captain hawson exclaimed

   are they coming for us   asked

   yes he answered   and theyll get
us too there is no hope of escaping
them they will not harm us for it is
against the law they will rush upon us
and make us prisoners and bind us we
may be able to kill a few but it will make
no difference they are fanatics cow-
ardly enough at times but frenzied de-
mons when their high priest has his eyes
upon them

   give me one of the revolvers ruth
said

   you need not fire at them the cap-
tain replied

   i do not wish to fire upon them she
said  i want the weapon there may
come a time when death will be welcome

  we made no reply and the captain
handed her one of his revolvers she hid
itaway beneath her dress then we filled
our two remaining weapons

  we were none too soon for they rushed
us immediately and we stood up to de-
fend our position better sending a hail of
lead down into the midst of them man
after man fell but the others came on
screeching and screaming like wild beings
not a weapon in their hands for at the
high priests command they had left their
weapons behind

  we fought until our revolvers were
empty and then they swarmed upon us
from front and rear and seized us and
bound our arms the captain fought with
all his strength but it availed him noth-
ing-

  i could not fight after my revolver was
empty because my wounded arm prevent-
ed it as for ruth they treated her ten-
derly and with awe and when we were
secure they led her down to the deck first
in all honor took me second and then
forced the captain to follow us we were
led before the high priest

  i felt his cold gray eyes upon me saw
him look at ruth and at captain hawson
his face growing sterner

   i like people who have the courage to
fight he said   but there is only one
end for those who fight against the great
aitu and its priests 

      chapter xx
      how ruth saved us

f n time we reached the shore each of
a us in a separate barge closely guard-
ed by a score of armed men then the
procession was formed while we were
hedged in by rows of fanatics who ap-
proached within twenty feet of us and
there stopped as though afraid we might
contaminate them if they came nearer

  at the head was the high priest the
other priests behind him the great aitu
carried on a raised platform borne on
mens shoulders

  then followed a srfuad of men and
then welch reclining in a litter his face
pale so weak that he could scarcely raise
his head to respond to the plaudits of the
mob for they did applaud him as a god

  ruth followed armed men before her
and behind her dressed in her golden
robes her hands bound behind her back
she walked with her head held down and
her face was pale too

  then came uncle dick guarded most
heavily of all  and when the people saw
him their faces grew dark and they ut-
tered loud cries of rage i followed un-
cle dick

  they seemed surprised to see me and
i thought many of their faces expressed
pity the captain came behind me still
wrestling with his guards there was a
lot of fight left in the captain and he
seemed determined to cause the fanatics
all the trouble he could before being hur-
ried to death

  we went up the broad avenue that led
through the heart of the village and to the
temple in the open space before the
temple there was another crowd of
screeching people as we approached the
temple the priests began their chant again
and the crowd parted and made way for
them

  straight into the temple we went and
into a great room with a high dome the


the railroad mans magazine

walls were covered with peculiar devices
and there were candles everywhere at
one end was a great throne with draperies
of gold on every side of it and while we
watched the aitu was carried forward and
placed in its old place on the throne

  the guards ranged themselves against
the walls and the people crowded in be-
hind through the doors as many as could
find place and then while we stood in
the open space in the center of the room
before the aitu the religious ceremony
began and endured for about three hours
it was the most weird thing i have ever
seen

  we were so exhausted that we could
scarcely stand when it was concluded and
i marveled at the people who had stood
silently through it all and who even now
did not appear anxious to go

  i soon found why-we were to be tried
for our lives the high priest addressed
the others then turned toward us

    richard engle he said  step for-
ward  

  uncle dick went up and stood before
him

   you are now returned to the temple
you desecrated the high priest said  it
is decreed by our laws that he who touches
the great aitu unless he lie a priest of the
temple dies you were once condemned
for that offense

   while awaiting execution you man-
aged to make your escape from the tem-
ple  it was through your commands that
our city was looted that things sacred to
us were stolen and removed and that the
great aitu was taken by soiled hands from
his throne to a foreign land

    for this offense the law says you are
to die the most terrible of all deaths
what have you to say richard engle
before the great aitu commands your exe-
cution  

  uncle dick faced him bravely

   only this he replied  that i
touched the aitu on my other visit here
through the treachery of a man that i
never took the aitu from its throne nor
had it removed from this island  that i
respect your religion and all other relig-
ions and would desecrate no temple
whether it be one of christianity or idol-
atry

   you deny your guilt the priest
demanded

   i declare that i am inuocent of the
theft of the aitu  said uncle dick

   you were carried away in the ship
which carried away the god so i am
told

   by whom  

    by a priest of the temple

    welch  

   he was so called among people of
your kind before he became one of us

   suppose i declare that he knows more
concerning the theft of vour -aitu than
do i

   such a thing is beyond belief the
high priest declared  you will gain
nothing by trying to throw your guilt on
the shoulders of another

   i have spoken the truth i am done
said uncle dick

  the priest addressed the aitu then
faced uncle dick again

    you die at rise of sun he said  you
die the most terrible of deaths i too
have spoken and am done

  the guards led uncle dick back to us
and the priest then called for captain
hawson

   you engaged in an enterprise for
money the priest said  you promised
to carry out our orders faithfully now
it appears that you attempted to thwart
us by rescuing the man you held as pris-
oner because he offered you more money
than you were to receive from us for an
opposite service and now what have
you to say 

    i have this to say the captain cried
 the man who told you that lied and
i have this to say too-that i started 
this trip with the best intentions in the
world but that the scoundrel you have
taken into your priesthood convinced me
he was dealing double and i turned
against him

   when i start a thing i generally
finish it i stand by my friends here even
if it costs me my life and you can bet ill
fight every minute of the time between
now and when i become a corpse

   and before i die ill tell you
what  think of this blamed island and
its people and its freak of an idol and
its foolish laws all i want before i die
is a chance to get this man welch by the
throat and choke the life out of him 

   he is a wounded man  he says you
shot him the priest answered  you
the daughter of the idol



are therefore also accused of offering
violence to a priest of the aitu

   i did shoot him and my only regret
is that the bullet didnt strike him in a vi-
tal spot the captain said and as far as
offering violence to a priest is concerned
let me tell you this i am a seafaring man
and i have no liking for pirates

   when this man welch cooked up his
story and took command of my ship
against my wish he became a pirate i
had the right to shoot and to shoot to
kill the law gives me the right

   not the law we know the high priest
said  you offered violence to a priest
-you have admitted it 

   then ill offer more violence to an-
other priest  the captain cried

  before the guards could stop him he
had the high priest by the throat and was
choking the life out of him then the
guards rushed in and i beheld captain
hawson in the midst of them his great
arms swinging his lists landing like
sledges and men scattered all about him

  but it could not last long soon they
had him conquered the high priest arose
and straightened his robes and rubbed his
sore neck there was menace in his eyes
and in his voice

   there is  need for further consid-
eration of your case he said  you too
die at rise of sun 

  then the guards forced the captain
back against the wall the high priest
beckoned me and i stepped forward

   you are but a boy he said not un-
kindly  yet the aitu is angry at you you
touched the idol unknowingly perhaps
but nevertheless the aitu will not be sa-
cred again until your life has paid the
forfeit for its desecration i am empow
ered to order for you a deatli more merci-
ful but the end is the same you too
die at rise of sun 

  i was taken back by the guards with-
out having had a chance to speak a word
then he led ruth forward

    you have been selected as a daughter
of the temple the priest said to her
 you are to become the bride of one of
our order i am told that aboard ship
before the great aitu you began the cere-
mony of betrothal and did not complete
it such an act means death unless you
agree to continue the ceremony now and
to atone by fasting for your reluctance

before what have you to say speak
at once 

  ruth raised her pretty head and looked
him straight in the eyes

   when  visited your land before she
said  i learned your laws and your re-
ligion i am surprised to find that the
high priest of the aitu himself wishes to
desecrate his temple

   woman what clo you mean the
priest cried

   you ask why i did not complete a
ceremony once started did not you your-
self a few minutes ago say the aitu would
not be sacred again until those who had
desecrated it had paid the penalty with
their lives then the aitu was not sa-
cred aboard ship for those who had dese-
crated it still lived did i do right or
wrong to refuse to conclude a ceremony
before an aitu not sacred-to refuse to
make a mockery of your sacred laws

   what is this  the priest cried

   had  concluded the ceremony before
the aitu when it was not sacred before you
had purified it again it would have been
a desecration would it not would you
want for a daughter of the temple a
woman who had desecrated the temples
aitu 

   woman you speak with wisdom the
priest said  you have honored the tem-
ple by your forethought

  he turned to one of the other priests
and gave some orders and the priest went
out presently he returned leading the
way for those who bore the litter holding
welch the high priest told welch all
that had transpired welchs face wore
the evil smile again

 it is a trick he said  but one which
will not serve the aitu is sacred in part
because it has been placed on its throne
 that is true  the high priest said

   and all that remains to make it sacred
wholly is the execution of the two men
and the boy  

    that too is true 

   then if they are executed at rise of
sun to-morrow the aitu will be sacred
again the ceremony of betrothal may be
held immediately after the execution

   so be it  the high priest ordered

   you see welch said to ruth  this
trick will not serve you either it only
makes more sure the death of your
friends	-


the railroad mans magazine

    lead the prisoners to the room of the
condemned to await execution the high
priest commanded  take the woman in
all state to an apartment let women wait
upon her see that she has every comfort
she has wisdom beyond her years

  ruth holland stepped toward him
again

   stop  she commanded  would
you again desecrate the aitu  

   what does the daughter mean now 
the high priest asked with fear in his
eyes

   a person may not be condemned ex-
cept before the sacred aitu and cannot
be executed unless so condemned

    that is true

    then these men cannot die

   why the high priest demanded

   they have not been condemned be-
fore a sacred aitu

   i do not understand

    the aitu is not sacred until they are
executed and they cannot be executed
unless condemned before the sacred aitu
how can you then condemn them 
dont you see your aitu will never be
sacred again

  never be sacred again the priest

cried  

    it can never be ruth said  it can-
not be sacred unless these men die and
they cannot die because there is no sacred
aitu before which to condemn them 
some of the priests began to screech at
one another  others to explain the mean-
ing of the scene to the people welch
half arose from the litter to expostulate
but fell back weak and senseless they
carried him out to give him attention

   the high priest demanded silence

   daughter he said  your words
trouble me it is necessary that i consult
the laws regarding this peculiar state of
affairs i may require your wisdom in
the council-chamber and if such is the
case you will be sent for meanwhile the
prisoners are not condemned and must be
treated with courtesy guards remove
them to apartments guard them well
but see well to their comfort also

  in the excitement of the moment as
they were preparing to move us ruth
holland passed within a few feet of
where we three were standing

    perhaps i have gained a little time
she said

  her words held meaning for none but
we three who knew of the cruisers com-
ing her eyes held meaning for none
save uncle dick

      chapter xxi
      captured by the mob

t n one corner of the temple was a high
a tower and in a room at the top of
the tower uncle dick captain hawson
and myself were placed as soon as the
crowd had been driven from the temple
by the priests and the guards

   the people crowded the open space be-
fore the temple refusing to go to their
homes they were talking angrily among
themselves

   there may be trouble the captain
said  they have got it into their heads
that the aitu can never be sacred again
that they are doomed to eternal unrest
and that we are in some manner responsi-
ble for the state of affairs

    it makes little difference to us my
uncle replied  only one of two things
can happen-either well die or the
cruiser will arrive in time to rescue us
if we die it matters little whether it be
at the hands of the priests or the people

  the afternoon passed swiftly in the
evening food was carried to us by the
guard the men looked at us angrily as
they passed it to us and muttered to each
other but neither the captain nor uncle
dick could-catch the meaning of their
words

  the night came-a beautiful tropical
night with the bright moon shining
through the palms and making the white
huts of the fanatics look like silver pal-
aces

   and with the night came trouble

   in the square before the temple the na-
tives had been gathering from all parts of
the island since early afternoon now
several thousand were grouped there in
the bright moonlight jabbering to each
other screaming and screeching once
or twice the priests went out and ad-
dressed them trying to get them to dis-
perse  but to no avail

   as the hours passed their frenzy in-
creased their shouts became deafening
from the tower window we watched them
wondering how it would end somewhere
the daughter of the idol



in the temple below us the high priest and
his assistants were trying to straighten
out the tangle ruth had caused by her
reasoning

   the people evidently awaited only the
verdict of the priests if it was against
us all would be well as far as the people
were concerned if it was reported that
the aitu could never be sacred again our
lives would not be worth much if we fell
into the hands of that mob of frenzied
fanatics

  it was midnight perhaps when a man
in the golden robe of priesthood left the
temple and stood high upon the pedestal
of a monument in the square with the
crowd surging about him he waved his
hand for silence then turned half-way 
toward the temple that the crowd could
see him and his words be better heard

  we saw him too it was welch

   hes going to make an attempt to
make them disperse the captain said

 now well see how much influence he
has with this crowd

   they are almost worshiping him to-
night because he returned the aitu to
them said uncle dick  theyll prob-
ably do anything he tells them to do

    listen  the captain demanded

   the great crowd had become silent and
welch began to speak in the native
longue captain hawson translated for
me

    children of the aitu he said  i
come before you now in an attempt to
show what love i have for you in my
heart some time since  made the journey
to a foreign land and after suffering
hardships untold i rescued from the hands
of unbelievers the great aitu your ruler
and mine for the aitu is indeed the
ruler and none of its priests the great
aitu has been returnedand now sits upon
his throne he is as sacred now as ever

   the people began cheering like mad be-
ings but again he silenced them with a
wave of his hand

   i say it is as sacred now as ever
without a sacred aitu my children we
are all lost because a woman with a
smooth tongue has twisted words shall 
we believe the great aitu is not sacred
she has done this thing to confound your
priests and to save from death the men
who have desecrated the temple and de-
filed the god

   the high priest listens to her words
he is almost ready to announce to you
that the aitu is not sacred that these
men must go free and can never be pun-
ished for their desecration  say to you
my children that i have just left the
council-chamber because the high priest
and his assistants are trying to take from
you your one great belief  what can we
do without a sacred aitu

   i take my life in my hands to tell
you this for the other priests will be angry
at my words i have done much for you
my children will you do something for
me

   will you stand behind me and say
that these men must die that the aitu is
sacred and that no womans word can
make it otherwise will you go with me-
into the temple and stop the desecration
that the high priest and his brethren would
work 

  he would have said more but they
stopped him shrieks and cries rang out
-a bedlam of voices

  to the temple to the temple
they cried  kill the unbelievers we
will have a new high priest 

  they surged around the monument upon
which he stood trying to kiss the hem
of his robe praising him in their cries
some of them tried to lift him upon their
shoulders but he stopped them and raised
his hand for silence again

    am weak because of my wound he
told them  lead the way into the tem-
ple my children work your own will
with the priests and the prisoners spare
the woman for it is my wish

   spare the woman  they cried to
each other

   let some of you stand by me for
there are those who seek my life he said

 remember the unbelievers in the tower
must die and your untruthful priests must

die

   when that work is done gather here
again in quiet and we will praise the aitu

   give us the word master-give us
the word   they cried

   into the temple welch screamed

  have given you the word 

  then the bedlam broke out again and
the thousands surged toward the temple
entrance their cries filling the night 

it is a matter of a short time now
uncle dick said  there is no escape


the railroad mans magazine

from the tower even if we could get out
of the apartment

  captain hawson ran to the door and
tried it but found it fastened securely
he called to the guard but there was no
response it was evident that the guard
had grown frightened and had fled leav-
ing us to face death

  while the captain and uncle dick
worked at the door trying to force it
open i ran back to the window the
cries of the mob were deafening they
were crowding into the temple as many
as possible welch still stood upon the
pedestal half a hundred men surround-
ing him

  had any of us in the tower possessed
a revolver it is certain that he would not
have lived long

  i thought of the weapon ruth had
hidden in her dress before we left the
ship and wished it were in my possession

  we could hear the screeching inside the
temple now above the din rose the voice
of the high priest shrill and clear he
was trying to stop them and then the
voice was lost in a tempest of cries and
we heard it no more but in a few min-
utes we saw through the window that the
high priest and all his brethren had been
carried out as prisoners and were being
held before welch under strong guard

   what shall we do with them mas-
ter   the crowd demanded

   as you will  welch cried

  again the tempests of shrieks greeted
his speech and the priests were hurried
away in the midst of the crowd and taken
toward the water-front

  but the great majority remained in the
temple and in the square before it and
their shrieks and cries came nearer they
were searching all the rooms for us
searching them one by one evidently de-
termined that no chance of escape should
be given us

  again we heard their loud cries and
this time ruth was taken from the temple
and carried before welch

   spare the woman  he cried  hold
her herebefore me and let her not be
harmed 

  and so some score of them guarded her
but treated her with deep courtesy and
the others rejoined the mob inside the
temple and renewed the search for us
and soon tliev had reached the tower and

were coming up we looked at each other
hopelessly

  we had no weapons it would be but
the work of half a minute for that mob
to enter the apartment and seize us the
work of a couple of minutes to carry us
down and place us before welch and
then-

  they were outside in the corridor now
breaking in the doors we huddled to-
gether near the window waiting

  then our door came in with a great
crash and the fanatics poured into the
room uttering their weird cries when
they saw us captain hawson sprang
into the midst of them striking right and
left with his great fists but his resist-
ance was useless and it was the last ex-
pression of violence he could make

  he was seized and bound and uncle
dick and i were taken easily and then
they started to lead us down the corridor
down the long winding stairs and to the
square in a few minutes we stood be-
fore welch the center of a mass of
screeching fanatics welch demanded si-
lence and got it

   desecraters of the temple he said
 there is no room for argument in your
case death is the only thing we can
grant you and it must be a swift death
for the great aitu demands it

  ruth ran forward to the foot of the
pedestal

   let me die with them she implored

  the evil smile came into welchs face
again 

   death is not for you he said  it
is my wish that you live to be my bride 

   let me die with them she asked
again

  no you must live the betrothal
ceremony takes place as soon as these men
have met death

   a woman cannot go into a betrothal
ceremony with a dead man   she cried

   what do you mean  he asked

  her hand went into her robe quickly
and when it came out something bright
flashed in the moonlight-the revolver
she had hidden away before we left the
ship

   dont ruth   uncle dick screamed
he knew what would happen if she fired
upon welch-the people would tear her
to pieces

  but she did not heed his crv
the daughter of the idol



    i mean this she said in answer to
welchs question

   and then she fired

chapter xxii

i am chosen to live

cor an instant the wild clamor of the
mob ceased the smoke drifted to
one side and we saw welch standing
against the base of the monument alive

  ruth raised the revolver again the
gleam of determination in her eyes but
before she could fire the shrieks of the
angry mob rang out and the guards
rushed in and seized her and tore the
weapon from her grasp

  then they stood back holding her by
the arms and looked up at welch he
raised his hand and the mob was still

   the woman is crazed by the excite-
ment and by her long journey on the sea
he said  she did not realize what she
was doing you see her bullet did not
wound me the great aitu is merciful to
me and guards me because i have de-
clared him sacred

  he could turn even such an event as
this then to his own credit

    the great aitu has saved the master
the aitu has saved the new high priest 
they cried

  again they surged toward the base of
the monument praising the hypocrite be-
fore them again he waved them back

    you must think no ill of the woman
he said  she did not know what she
was doing she is possessed and will be
until these defilers of the aitu are slain
she must be placed in her apartment and
allowed to rest see that it is done as
for these others-it is within half an hour
of rise of sun and they must die then
take them to the execution-ground 

  the guards closed in upon us again
and again ruth holland ran forward and
faced welch

    wait  she cried

   what does the daughter of the aitu
wish now he asked

   is it true that i am to become the-
bride of a priest and a daughter of the
aitu  she asked

    that is true it has been decreed

   then i demand the rights which are
mine under the law she said

   what rights daughter

   the law says that a woman about to
become a daughter of the aitu may spare
the lift of one condemned man is that
not so 

  welch could not deny it it was a law-
well known to all the people for the cere-
mony was always observed at betrothal
he did not dare risk the anger of the
populace by refusing

   you have spoken truly daughter he
replied

   then i demand the life of one of
these prisoners

   according to the law you may save
the life of one but the one you save must
be exiled from the island after having
had his cheek branded

   such is the law she said

   then i grant you your rights daugh-
ter he answered  one shall be saved
he shall have his cheek branded and
shall be sent away from the island on the
ship which brought us here it is for you
to say daughter which one shall be
saved

  she turned and looked toward us then
hesitated welch was looking at uncle
dick and his face still wore the evil
smile he thought that of course she
would save uncle dick

  and i knew as i watched his face what
he was thinking-that uncle dick might
sail away from the island alive in the ship
but would never reach a foreign port
alive there were too many ready to do
welchs bidding especially if he told
them they would please the great aitu in
so doing

   which one daughter  he demand-
ed  it is almost time for the execution

   it is written in the law ruth said
 that it is my privilege to save the man
on the ground of execution at the last
minute when the sudden respite from
death will make him praise me and thus
bless my marriage

  welchs face clouded but he could not
deny the law

   that is true he said

   i demand that right also

   you wish to witness the execution
daughter are you strong enough to do
so 

   i may return from the execution-
ground as soon as i have made my
lioice she said


the railroad mans magazine

   then let us go to the ground of ex-
ecution welch ordered

  the crowd began to screech again and
a procession was formed a litter was
taken forward and welch reclined in it
and was carried ahead on mens shoul-
ders then the guard formed and we
were placed in the center and urged for-
ward

  ruth was carried  another litter be-
hind us and behind her came the thou-
sands of maddened people cheering and
chanting uttering their weird cries on
and on we marched half a mile or more

  after a time we reached a large clear-
ing in the midst of the jungle there was
an altar in the center of it draped in
yellow cloth a circle of sea-shells was
around the altar at a radius of twenty
feet

  the people formed in columns at the
edge of the clearing and the guard led
us forward toward the altar but outside
the circle of shells they stopped welchs
litter was carried forward and placed
upon the ground and he was helped to
his feet

  then ruth followed and stood close
beside us there were tears in her eyes

  welch walked inside the circle of shells
and approached the altar he removed
the golden cloth and threw it to one
side we saw a flat bed of stone large
enough for a man to lie upon i expected
to see blood upon it for i thought the
mob had executed the priests there but
there was no blood the stone was clean

  welch seemed to be thinking the same
thing he turned to the guards

   what did you do with the former
priests he demanded there has
been no execution here for some time

   master one of them said  we dared
not enter the circle of shells to execute
them for there was no loyal priest among
us the priests were made prisoners back
in the village and their guards told to
bring them out after these prisoners had
been executed they should be here
now	-

   it is well welch said  when they
are brought i shall appoint priests to do
the work

  he left the altar and came back to us

  it is time for you to denote the man
you avish to save daughter he said

to be co

   i may speak to the men alone first 
  she asked

  yes he agreed and stepped back
 and motioned for the guards to do the
 same ruth walked nearer us

  i do not know what to do now she
 said  this was a trick to save all the
 time possible

     it is the end said the captain  no
  one can save us now

   at least i can save one of you she
  said  but i cannot save myself for i
  shall take my own life at the first oppor-
  tunity

  ruth  uncle dick implored

   there is  other way she said

  hurry daughter said welch

   i do not know what to do she said
  to us

  do not let me concern you count
 me out captain hawson said  i have
 lived my life i am not afraid to die
 either of the others is worth more to the
 world than i

   you are a brave man ruth said

  it lies between mr engle and ro-
 land the captain responded

 ruth looked uncle dick in the eyes
 and for a moment they stood thus trying
 to read each others thoughts then she
 looked at me and her eyes filled

   the boy my uncle whispered to her

  she stepped nearer him

   death must claim me soon she said
   perhaps if you love me it is better we
  leave the world together

   i love you enough to die with you
  my uncle said

   then you believe in me at last 

   yes he whispered

   i can die happy now she said  just
  when i could live most happily

  she took another step toward him and
  in an instant they were in each others
  arms and their lips met welch uttered
  a cry and staggered toward them the
  guards made no move not knowing what
  to do

 but before welch reached them they
 had separated and ruth had staggered
 away from him

 which one daughter welch de-
 manded  is it to be this man 

 he pointed at uncle dick

   no  ruth cried  i save the boy

on the editorial carpet

      side-talks with the man who sits in the cab of
      the magazine and is commonly called an editor

this month we are bringing out of the
construction shop a fine piece of roll-
ing stock which we have been promising for
some time past it is a serial by j aubrey
tyson you are quite used to seeing this
designers work on our main line and judg-
ing by the letters we received when we sent
 the man of straw  and others over the
track you will be getting something that you
like in without lights the present story

 we are now confronted with the most
pleasant task of the month talking about
next months lay-out its a peculiar thing
in human nature this thing of talking about
what you are going to do

  it seems as if everybody carrying a pound
of steam has to work it off or blow it off
every bod j with an ambition or a hope or
an idea enjoys talking about it theres
something inspiring about it

  we enjoy talking about next months lay-
out because it indicates two things-a work
well done in the number we are closing and
the pleasure of good work to be done in
the number we are promising we are not
however of the kind that has to blow off
steam to prevent it from blowing the boiler-
tubes through the sand-dome the pleasure
we take in talking is the pleasure that men
take when they have something to say that
somebody else wants to hear

  some people shoot off their exhaust for
the pleasure of making a noise like a con-
sumptive rhinoceros regardless  the fact
that their drivers are slipping four revolu-
tions for every inch they make they need
a pusher but they dont know it

 when you see the april number youll
realize that we are not talking without sayr
ing something we are pulling a fine string
of fiction we shall possibly switch in a
new railroad serial by a man whose work
in this magazine has proved second to none
in pleasing either the readers or the editors

  we dont want to be too specific about this
because there are so many exigencies in the
making up of a magazine-train that when
we promise you something as good as this
we like to be certain that all our couplings
are made and in order its too good to
cause disappointment

  in the matter of short stories we shall
probably run seven cars and there wont
be a flat car nor a flat wheel in the whole
bunch three such names as robert fulker-
son hoffman j r stafford and augustus
wittfeld can be trusted to carry any issue
up the steepest grades you can mention and
the other stories will not put all the pull on
these three either

  besides stories by these authors there will
be as well-told a story as we have run in
many a day by a new author mr william
d ball it is called  how komo bill went
east  at the present time but before the fine-
toothed comb is passed through it for the
last time it may emerge with some other title
anyhow look for william d ball

  donnellys hunch by h h giebler is
just as good in a slightly different way it
is a railroad story and we guess we know
a thing or two about railroad stories

  then there is a story of a million dollars
on exhibition better read up on that so
that if ever you come across a stray million
dollars either on exhibition or not you will
know it when you see it our true story

 old dutch cheese is very funny

  but in spite of the fact that this is one
of the best fiction numbers we have ever put
out we think the fiction will have to take
second place to the special articles

  the star feature of these will be the first
of a new series by r h rogers especially
intended for young men who want to learn
practical railroading the first subject is the
work of  the railroad apprentice

  very few writers enjoy the confidence of
their editors as mr rogers enjoys ours he
has to a greater degree than any man we
know the knowledge of the operating end 
of a railroad combined with the ability to
tell others what he knows in such a manner
as will interest them and instruct them as
a railroad man of high standing he speaks
with the authority which few writers no
matter how familiar with the subject can
speak

  his knowledge of his subjects is only
equaled by his modest and sympathetic atti-
tude and this with his able pen forms a
combination of rare effectiveness


	the railroad mans magazine

  we regard this series by mr rogers as
one of the most important we have ever put
on the line

 arno dosch will have something to say
about the progress that is being made in
railroad signaling and willard d eakin
about the hardships of the railway mail
service

  for the old-timers there will be the ro-
mantic history of that one-famous engine
the new york centrals no 

  j e smith contributes the twenty-third
observation of a country station-agent-an
observer who is never tiresome this time
it is the lonely crossing watchman whom
brother smith writes about there are some
human phases to the humblest job

 do you know why every railroad has a
trade-mark and the story behind that trade-
mark if not you will know when you
read our april number

spark-arresters

we have found ourselves out on
looking through the february maga-
zine we find ourselves making a weird state-
ment which we know will cause all good
railroad men to think we ought to be drawn
in little bits through the exhaust of a mallet
articulated compound-gently of course so
as not to hurt us in any way

  in the  recent railroad patents  article
questions and answers department a reader
asks if spark-arresters are in general use
by a slip in the composing room mr smith
was quoted as replying that there were few
spark-arresters in use

  of course mr smith knew and we knew
and the compositor knew and the proof-
reader knew and probably the news-dealer
knew that every locomotive in new york
state and -most likely in nearly every state
in the union must to conform with the law
be fitted with a spark-arrester by some slip
the word patented was left out and the
answer should have indicated that few  pat-
ented spark-arresters  are in use

  it seems like a very small thing but the
leaving out of a word resulted in a perfectly
sensible answer being converted into one that
made us feel as if we had been arresting
sparks and other things all night



among the singers

we have three inquiries for songs one
gentleman writing from fruitvale
california says one or two very nice things
about us then asks us if we can give him

the words of the song  from the cradle
to the grave

  another gentleman living at obrien flor-
ida sends with a subscription to the maga-
zine the following request  please ask
some violinist of the railroad army to send
me the song of  sherum 

  another reader from anniston alabama
quotes the first line of a song  yonder
comes old f  b the fastest  the line
and asks us if we can supply the rest of the
song

  will gentlemen with tuneful natures and
long memories see if they can help us and
our friends in these matters

perpetual motion claims

as we anticipated we have received quite

-	a number of letters discussing our
recent articles on perpetual motion we
called the theory  the greatest of delu-
sions and much as we sympathize with the
people who have worked patiently for many
years  this problem we fear that we have
as yet found no reason to change our opinion

 all the letters we have received that
have made any claim have stated merely
that the writer has solved the problem of
course it could hardly be expected that such
a badly stated claim would convince u of
its own accuracy

  therefore if we seem skeptical and still
persist in calling this search  the greatest
of delusions we trust that our correspond-
ents will realize that while we have every
sympathy with their ambitions a statement
is not a proof and that we cannot give
space to letters making such large claims
 such small grounds

  frankly we do not believe that the secret
of perpetual motion has been discovered we
are in grave doubt whether such a secret
exists or not perpetual motion would be a
contradiction of all present known natural
laws of which the key-note is action and
reaction

  if we thought that this statement would
discourage any of our friends from follow-
ing what we feel to be a will-o-the-wisp
we should make it gladly but as it is we
make it rather sadly for we fear that peo-
ple will still continue to hunt for this elu-
sive jack-o-lantern and will still be dis-
appointed

  one reader suggests that some millionaire
become interested in his invention to the
extent of ten thousand dollars he says that
a millionaire would not feel this any more
than he himself would feel the cost of a
postage-stamp

we fear that our friend is confronted
on the editorial carpet

with another delusion even as hard to over-
come as that of perpetual motion ten
thousand dollars is a large sum of money
to any but the most profligate and extrava-
gant

    millionaires are usually millionaires be-
cause they have accurately gaged the real
value of money their attitude toward ten
thousand dollars is probably one of much
greater respect than that of the irresponsi-
ble people who let the figures roll off their
tongues with even greater ease than they
ask for a postage-stamp

the face on the barroom
floor

to the many readers of the railroad
mans magazine who in response
to w h k of oakland california in our
january issue sent us the words of this fa-
mous poem we extend our sincere thanks
we are very glad to give it a place in the
cluster of classics which the readers of the
carpet find so popular open her up

   the face on the barroom floor

by h antoine darcy

t was a balmy summer evening and a
   goodly crowd was there

which wellnigh filled joes barroom on the
    corner of the square

and as songs and witty stories came through
    the open door

a vagabond crept slowly in and posed upon
    the floor

where did it come from some one said

     the wind has blown it in

 what does it want   another cried  some
    whisky rum or gin

here toby sick him if your stomachs
    equal to the work	

i wouldnt touch him with a fork lies as
    filthy as a turk

this badinage the poor wretch took with
    stoical good grace

in fact he smiled as though he thought hed
    struck the proper place

 come boys i know theres kindly hearts
    among so good a crowd

to be in such good company would make a
    deacon proud

 give me a drink-thats what i want-im
    out of funds you know

when i had cash to treat the gang this
    hand was never slow

what you laugh as though you thought
   this pocket never held a sou

 once was fixed as well my boys as any
    one of you



there thanks thats braced me nicely

    god bless you one and all

next time i pass this good saloon ill make
    another call

give you a song no i cant do that my
    singing days are past

my voice is cracked my throats worn out
    and my lungs are going fast

 say give me another whiskv and ill tel

    you what ill do-

iii	tell you a funny story and a fact 
    promise too

that  was ever a decent man not one of
    you would think 

but i was some four or five vears back
    say give me another drink

 fill her up joe  want to put some life
    into my frame-

such little drinks to a bum like me are
    miserably tame

five fingers-there thats the scheme-and
    corking whisky too

well heres luck boys and landlord my
    best regards to you

 youve treated me pretty kindly and id
like to tell you how
i came to be the dirty sot you see before
you now

as i told you once i was a man with muscle
    frame and health

and but for a blunder ought to have made
    considerable wealth

 i was a painter-not one that daubed on
    bricks and wood-

but an artist and for my age was rated
    pretty good

i worked hard at my canvas and was bid-
    ding fair to rise

for gradually i saw the star of fame before
    my eyes

 i made a picture perhaps youve seen tis
    called the  chase of fame

it brought me fifteen hundred pounds and
    added to my name

and then i met a woman-now comes the
   funny part-

with eyes that petrified my brain and sunk
    into my heart

why dont you laugh tis funny that the
vagabond you see
could ever love a woman and expect her
love for me

but tvvas- so and for a month or two her
    smiles were freely given

and when her loving lips touched mine it
    carried me to heaven

 did you ever see a woman for whom your
    soul youd give

with a form like the milo venus too beau-
    tiful to live

with eyes that would beat the kohinoor and
    a wealth of chestnut hair

if so twas she for there never was another
    half so fair
	the railroad mans magazine

 i was working on a portrait one afternoon
    iirmay

of a fair-haired boy a friend of mine who
    lived across the way

and madeline admired it and much to my

     surprise

said that shed like to know the man that
    had such dreamy eyes

 it didnt take long to know him and before
    the month had flown

my friend had stolen my darling and  was
    left alone

and ere a year of misery had passed above
    my head

the jewel i had treasured so had tarnished
    and was dead

 thats why  took to drink boys why i
    never saw you smile

i thought youd be amused and laughing all
    the while

why whats the matter friend theres a
    teardrop in your eye

come laugh like me tis only babes and
    women that should cry

 say boys if you give me jiist another
    whisky ill be glad

and ill draw right here a picture of the face
    that drove me mad

give me a piece of chalk with which you
    mark the baseball score-

you shall see the lovely madeline upon the
    barroom floor

another drink and with chalk in hand the
vagabond began
to sketch a face that well might buy the
soul of any man

then as he placed another lock upon the
    shapely head

with a fearful shriek he leaped and fell
    across the picture-dead

a newspaper runaway

as a further illustration of what one of
our readers wrote to us about some
time ago apropos of the wonderful feats
performed on railroads-according to the
newspapers-we would like to call attention
to the following	v

    a sunday newspaper desirous of running
a good railroad story hit upon an incident
on the lehigh valley and it hit upon it
with great effect yardmaster thomas nor-
mile and engineer tiill burke of sayre
pennsylvania were the heroes of the feat
and they had every athlete aeroplanist and
japanese tumbler up in the air and gasping
for breath

   an engine xo  by some means got
under way and went out of the yards at
sayre without control then mr nor-

mile began to use wild-west oratory and per-
form marvels of daring and agility-accord-
ing to the newspaper

  to quote one or two of the realistic sen-
tences 

  toms vocabulary was limited but his
resources-where the rolling stock of the
lehigh was concerned-were practically
boundless tom flew back to the station
and phoned to the train despatcher to stop
the fast freight at milan if not already too
late

  it was but tom had not waited even a
second for a reply he rounded up the
crew of one of the switch-engines who were
taking their night lunch-hour  the plat-
form and said to the engineer bill burke
as they leaped aboard

  we must catch  before she meets
the fast freight coming this way lickety-split
or therell be something doing  can tell
you		

    well catch her or bust answered
burke as he jerked the lever weve got to
catch her  

  then began the chase we wish we could
take our readers with us on that chase we
are quite sure they never went on one any-
thing like it

  at last having got both engines going at
the speed requisite for the performance of a
great brave feat fifty miles an hour-no feat
is ever performed in any newspaper at less
than fifty miles an hour and it ought to
be sixty-engineer burke as his engine
came alongside  mounted the tender and
carefully calculating iris flying leap sprang
and lauded in the tender of the runaway

  the story  continues 

   that was an anxious moment for nor-
mile in which he watched eagerly to note
whether the feat had really succeeded the
jumper might have fallen and be lying un-
conscious in the tender if so a disaster
infant his death also presently-it was only
the work of a few seconds-there was a
grunt at the levers of the runaway

   the reverse had been applied by the
rescuing hand the madcap  came to a
stop only a few feet away from jb- whose
headlight glared upon her rear as if in re-
proach and indignation

  then follows a touching dialogue between
the yardmaster and the engineer and the
newspaper account closes with the comment
 but it was normiles generalship all the
same

  when we saw this fearful and wonder-
ful story we were curious whenever we
are curious we have to satisfy ourselves or
smash a side-rod we quote a letter from
the general manager of the company satis-
fying our curiosity
on the editorial carpet



    it appears that the throttle on this engine
had been left open while making repairs aft-
er the fire had been dumped and after firing
it up and it gained sufficient steam to move
it started backward the reverse-lever being
in the back motion

   the switches were all set so that the
engine moved back onto the west-bound
track east of backer avenue bridge and at
the time it left the switches on to the west-
bound track was moving about twelve or
fifteen miles per hour

  our yardmaster mr normile stood near
the switches east of packer avenue bridge
and noticed the engine moving backward zyid
at once came to the conclusion that there was
 man in charge one of the switch-en-
gines in charge of engineman burke was
switching in the east end of the auburn di-
vision yard under packer avenue bridge
and normile at once ran over cut the engine
off and started east  the east-bound track

   they overtook engine  before it
rounded the curve west of athens and as
the speed of the engine was reduced to about
ten miles per hour engineman burke stepped
from the side of his engine  to the 
while the engines were alongside of each
other moving

   lie at once stopped the engine and ran
same back to sayre the engine was caught
and brought back to sayre before jb- ar-
rived the men  jb- not knowing anything
of the occurrence until it was talked of
later



thanks for both

you

mr thomas h dickson jr of
st paul minnesota took the trou-
ble to clip the little poem  the right
track from the st paul pioneer-press
and appended it to a letter to us in which
he says  as one who for some years en-
gaged in railroad service  would express
my commendation and appreciation of your
effort to make a thoroughly worth-while
magazine for the railroad boys thanks
and we gladly print the poem 

the right track

are you upon the right track my friend

  are you running upon the right rail

the way is long and the pace is swift

  and you want to be sure of the trail

dont open the throttle and give her steam
through the day so bright and night so
black

unless you are sure your way is secure
unless youre upon the right track

the track that is right is the track thats
      clear

  be sure it is the one you choose

no head- collision to throw you off

   and no signal-liglits to confuse

      will have up-grade and down-grade
      my friend

   through ledges and tunnels so black

but you can just fly like a bird a-sky

   if you are upon the right track

the rails of life they are right and left

  and they lead you to right and wrong
they are up and down they are in and out

   and the run is hard and long

the station reward is the terminal
for the engine that never turns back
there is joy for you when your train is due
if youve made it upon the right track

  from a traveling salesman

      r albert l terstegge a trav-
el mg salesman of richmond ken-
tucky sends us the following letter which
we publish with the most becoming modesty
known to us which is to turn as red as the
crown sheet of a mogul at the saip time
we thank mr terstegge for his kindness and
his sentiment

  i	have read the railroad mans maga-
zine from the very lirst and consider it one
of the best magazines  the market there
is always lots of information in each num-
ber-information that a person may and
very likely will have use for if hehas to
travel to any great extent as i do

   then again the stories while fiction seem
to me so much more possible-that is more
likely to happen in actual life-than the sto-
ries in other magazines even in these
stories you find out something you didnt
know before as well as in the regular in-
structive articles

  a salesman is out on the road most of
the time and unlike the railroader rarely
has a home i his work he needs cheer
brotherhood and good-fellowship and if
any man dont possess more of these quali-
ties after reading the railroad maxs
magazine he  sure aint much of a man

  it puts you right next to the boys who
have to do with your tourist book and to
whom you are very often tempted to quote
the bible when you miss a connection or
something but after reading the rail-
road mans magazine you begin to see
that maybe the trainmen dont deserve
 cussin  any more than you think you de-
served the last calling down you got from
the house

  keep the good work up



imitating hoboes

it is of course quite impossible for any
magazine to be responsible for all the
impressions and ideas conveyed between its
covers different minds interpret them in


the railroad mans magazine

different ways and the editor who could
know exactly what effect every line would
have upon every reader would be one of
those perfect beings who do not belong on
this earth

  at the same time a letter we have just
received from a reader is responsible for a
feeling within us that we ought to utter a
grave warning

  he says   am a railroad man and have
known this fellow welch or  penn as he
calls himself for a long time his poetry
and other matters he gives out cause many
boys to leave their homes

  my brother after reading his poem in
the railroad mans magazine issue of
january  remarked   will try and do
just as he does it and sure enough the
kid was practising cutting conductor punch-
marks an hour afterward making him liable
to arrest for forgery

  we dont often get solemn in this depart-
ment but we would like to say a few things
to boys whose ambition may lead them in the
direction of imitating hoboes

  there is more in life than a picturesque
and romantic atmosphere remember that
behind the romance is the dirt the wasted
opportunity the wasted life and the dissatis-
faction that you are quite unable to under-
stand at this time

 the sly or shrewd tricks of men whose
sole pride is how much and how often they
can beat a railroad or a citizen are quite
unworthy of anybodys imitation what
the reasons of these men are whether they
are real or imaginary why they are at war
with all that is legal and orderly and self-
respecting we do not know

  some of them doubtless feel that they have
bitter cause to be at war with everybody
probably they are mistaken

  blit one thing is certain that  boy with
a good home-or even a bad one-with a
clean mind strong body and clear intelli-
gence will find anything in their conduct or
means of living that he ought to imitate
he is far and away above them in all the
better and happier things of life and if he
imitates them he must of necessity go down-
ward and not upward to do so

  we do not mean to imply by all this that
the ordinary bright happy boy should de-
spise the unfortunate man who is or feels
himself to be forced to these tactics but
there is not the  slightest reason in this
world why any boy should of his own de-
liberate free will become what these men
have degenerated into through misfortune
of one kind or another and through a bitter-
ness which only years can understand

  perhaps our readers will retort by asking
us why we print stories and poems repre-

senting the tramp in more or less attractive
guise if our real attitude to him is what
we have just stated our answer is that the
tramp has become a necessary feature in
railroad literature he has become a part of
the romance of the railroad his pictur-
esqueness there is  possibility of denying
any more than one can deny the picturesque-
ness of certain rovers of the sea but at the
same time no sensible boy is anxious to
merely make  copy  for picturesque litera-
ture

the sunny south

we dont like to say  i told youso -
at least we say we dont-but we can-
not help once more calling the attention of
our readers to a matter  which we have
previously held forth with what we call
wisdom

  on various occasions we have advised our
friends against seeking employment in the
southern republics and even in mexico we
are reminded of this by reading the follow-
ing letter which we take from the locomo-
tive firemen and enginemens magazine

   should any more firemen ask you about
the ways and means of this country just ask
them if they are making their board if
the answer is no then tell them that they are
one hundred per cent better off there than
here anyway

   here is a little dope and if any of em
are equal to the game tell em to come 
last week oiie fellow got off the track twen-
ty-one times in sixty-two kilometers we
make bets as to whether we are  or off
the track i was in the worst wreck of the
season so far-two rail lengths of track
washed -away it was all of an undermine na-
ture-couldnt tell it till things began to pile
up it has rained for nearly two months
and as i am on the road every night you
may know that i am just like a drowned rat
at times you cant see ten feet ahead of the
engine with an electric light it rains so
heavy will not endeavor to give you all
risks assumed by men  the engine here
but i assure you that any of em that think
theyre lip against grief in the railroad line
in the u s a dont know the meaning
of the word in comparison with this neck o
the woods

   ive drank water here that was too dirty
to bathe in was  one four  hours
days trip and got seven hours sleep and not
any eating to amount to anything the pay
is nothing  hours per day  mexican
 cents per hour overtime engineers 
mexican money with same hours  cents
overtime  hour and  minutes constitutes
one hour in fact  hour and  minutes
for every hour

still it is an easy matter
when the new

philo

system

is adopted

the philo system is unlike all other
ways of keeping poultry

and in many respects just the reverse accomplishing things in poul-
try work that have always been considered impossible and getting
unheard-of results that are hard to believe without seeing

the new system covers all branches
of the work necessary for success

from selecting the breeders to marketing the product it tells how
to get eggs that will hatch how to hatch nearly every egg and how
to raise nearly all the chicks hatched it gives complete plans in
detail how to make everything necessary to run the business and at
less than half the cost required to handle the poultry business in any
other manner

two pound broilers in eight weeks

are raised in a space of less than a square foot to the broiler almost
without any loss and the broilers are of the very best quality bring-
ing here three cents per pound above the highest market price

our six-months-old pullets are laying
at the rate of  eggs each per month

in a space of two square feet for each bird no green cut bone of
any description is fed and the food used is inexpensive as compared
with food others are using

  our new book the philo system of poultry keeping gives
full particulars regarding these wonderful discoveries with simple
easy-to-understand directions ihat are right to the point and  pages
of illustrations showing all branches of the work from start to finish

dont let the chicks die in the shell

  one of our secrets of success is to save all the chickens that are
fully developed al hatching time whether they can crack the shell
or not it is a simple trick and believed to be the secret of the
ancient egyptians and chinese which enabled them to sell the
clucks at  cents a dozen

chicken feed at  cents a bushel

  our book tells how to make the best green food with but little
trouble and have a good supply any day in the year winter or sum-
mer it is just as impossible to set a large egg yield without green
food as it is to keep a cow without hay or fodder

our new brooder saves  cents on
each chicken

  no lamp required no danger of chilling overheating or burn-
ing up the chickens as with brooders using lamps or any kind of
fire they also keep all the lice off the chickens automatically or
kill any that may be on them when placed in the brooder our
book gives full plans and the right to make and use them one
can easily be made in an hour at a cost of  to  cents

 success if there can be any improvement on nature your brooder is it the first
 experience i had with your system was last december i hatched  chicks under
 two hens put them as soon as hatched in one of your brooders out of doors and at
 the age of three months i sold them at c a pound they then averaged  - lbs
