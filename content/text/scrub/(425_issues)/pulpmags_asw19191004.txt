vilos holbrook

kid you ring sir

 vilos holbrook poised his ciga-
 rette and regarded its glowing tip
 reflectively

  no i did not ring he said

  very well sir

  gallagher

 yes sir

  wait

  waiting sir

  gallagher how long have you been in
 my service

  habout height months sir going on
 nine

  and in that time you have asked me
 about a mythical bell at least one hundred
 times

  very sorry sir you see-

  gallagher

   yes sir

  call up the primrose club and ask the
 secretary if major garrick is in the card-
 room

  very well sir

	a-s	

   vilos leaned back from a library table
 and touched his shoulders against a wall
 his head dropped into his hands after he
 had tossed his cigarette into a fireplace
 he pressed his eyelids as he waited for the
 valet to return from the hall telephone

   he lifted his glance finally his was a
 norman face - as clean-cut as a cameo
 the nostrils were slender the nose was
 slightly arched without being in the least
 semetic he might have been a cardinals
 secretary set down iff a cloister but for the
 fixed strength of a doer and never a dream-
 er which showed in his chin and the straight
 lines of his mouth

   the valet returned and rustled the por-
 tieres

    the secretary says sir  es very
 sorry sir  but the major just stepped hout
 -hout hinto the night sir

    he said that eh well that was just
 like the major

     yes sir

    gallagher 

    yes sir

    did you ever happen to run across the
 heart of this town during your festive in-


all-story weekly

tervals-which are as frequent i presume
as your purse allows i believe they are
that frequent

   no sir i-

   a place gallagher where gentlemen
go to look for their wayward sons and the
sons go to search for erring fathers a
place to vivisect and analyze

   bless me sir hif i ave as a gentle-
mans gentleman hit would be no place for
me

   gallagher im getting bored ive an
income but its small ive this flat here
and its too large i want to discard elec-
trical engineering and take up balzac i
want to see life as it really is

   beggin your pardon sir but the very
same thing appened to me lud stephney
hin hengland e said e wanted to put
new wine in an old bottle e wasnt ex-
actly tired of life but e was a bit bored
y know e wasnt a young man like you
sir even if your air is turnin a bit gray
e an me does the alls and ratcliffe road
an one or two places on the surrey side
of the river e was a liberal e was no
end of a swell but a liberal an now
sir lady stephney is the same as whot
was once evie shannon of the alhambra-
a very improper place sir

   the heart of london town then-
 hit aint st pauls sir its some-
where else for me lud stephney it was
a music all

   and the heart of this town

   on a night like this sir i would say
the opera the peoplg over here beggin
your pardon sir avent the families back
of them sir and one place his about like
another sir

   gallagher

    yes sir

   where is the true heart of this city-
the place where people are natural where
they live an breathe and drink and die in
the good old way

   theres thieves dens sir and theres
orrible dives-just the same as seven dials
and whitechapel like as not theres
plenty to see in those places sir partic-
ularly hif you know the right door to knock
hupon hits hall on knowin the right
door sir

   what i want gallagher is a cross-
road where the underworld meets the poli-
ticians while the police watch on

    i ave it sir the jail

  vilos showed an even row of well-shaped
teeth without smiling he stared at the
valet with a quizzical frown he brushed
back his hair from his forehead and rose
from the chair he had been sitting upon

    gallagher he said  as a servant you
are passable as a wit you are immense
the jail exactly fits my hypothetical ques-
tion but i do not want to go to the jail
ill have to break a law to do that the
poor wretches in there are guilty of some
crime

   theres more outside lookin hin than
theres inside lookin hout sir at least
ive erd that sir

    very true but the ones outside havent
been caught i want to meet them before
they are caught cant you suggest a place
of that kind

    a dance sir

   do you know of one

   hi do and beggin your pardon sir
for not mentioning hit sooner theres the
cooks and ousemaids union at the an-
derson music ah hits two bobs with a
lady sir

   two bobs with a lady

    two shillin sir beggin your pardon
sir

    gallagher i cant very well go to that
you see im neither a cook nor a house-
maid suppose you call up the secretary
at the primrose club and ask him to tell
you what is going on at the music halls or
the west end tell him-

   the west end sir

  yes the west end

   oh sir hif that is what you want
theres a students ball there to-night i
put the card on your table in the smoking-
room hits hunder the paper-cutter hits
a card with a chorus lady kickin an old
coves at hoff sir but you aint going to
that sir hit isnt respectable

   sounds interesting said vilos  i
think i shall go if colonel bishop calls
tell him that i am out for the evening
make him comfortable the port is in the
decanter there are some cigars in that
where dead men walk



package i brought home this afternoon
place the colonel entirely at ease but under
no circumstances tell him i went to the
west end

   hi wouldnt tell hanybody youd go to
a place like that sir

   its just what i want gallagher
quick lay out my clothes and call a taxi
you can wait till the colonel comes-then
you can go to the housemaids and cooks
union at the anderson if you still feel
inclined

  thats why i asked did you ring sir
beggin your pardon sir

chapter ii

 gipsy cragen

gipsy cragen was dancing at the
three students ball she held the
eyes of a thousand votaries of bac-
chus the hour was late the night from
arts view-point was early

  above the gipsy tier after tier of boxes
lifted they were filled with bediamoned
women champagne in silver buckets and
solemn-looking ravens whose youthful faces
were said to be the oldest things in the
city

  fringing the gleaming wax-polished
arena of the hall other ravens phalanxed
to fan-fare or applaud the gipsy who pi-
rouetted in their midst with light feet dark-
blue eyes and parted hair

  as the toast of the evening she held
aloft a brimming glass of champagne her
round brown arm which might have been
chiseled by praxiteles swung in a slow cir-
cle and reflected a myriad rays of light
from the tinsel of her garish gown

  it was her night and her hour her
olive-tinted face was lighted by a fire in-
ternal-an abandon and a blending of all
the passions she was salome reincarnated
to turn instead of take mens heads

  the witchery of wings was imparted to
her slender figure and her tapping high-
heeled slippers she glided she poised she
lifted with the side sweep of the muse

  the ravens clapped their white-gloved
hands as she passed in stately measure
she tantalizingly held the glass from them

she stood finally in the center of the
hall and called in the clear voice of pan

  the grape is such a trouble dont you
     know

its full of wit and bubbles dont you know
you sip it and youre dry

you pour it and you sigh

you drink it and you cry dont you know

   it makes you awfully bored dont you
     know

  and youre glad when you are floored dont
      you know

for you only close one eye
when the others they will cry

   youre too full to drink but you can buy

         dont you know

  the gipsy touched the rim of the glass
with her lips the band struck up a french
march the dancers linked and skirled
over the floor in the intoxication of wine
music and loud laughter

  goose-girls with lucifers gretchens with
alphonsos airy lillians and dark spanish
grandees old men and young women
roses that bloomed to bud again-all joined
in the kaleidoscope of riot and boisterous
color

  the occupants in the upper boxes leaned
and hurled confetti and long ribbons of
bright paper they twined the feet of the
dancers the floor rocked with the mad-
dening march of six hundred couples the
air was filled with perfume and scent from
shaken laces old boys succeeded in loop-
ing light loves neck waiters hurried
throughout the throng their shrill cries
resembled reed-notes among dervishes

  standing within the press of anxious ra-
vens was vilos holbrook he had heard
the gipsys pagan toast he had seen her
touch her lips to the glass he had caught
her glance over a beaded rim

  he took a step forward at that moment
he thought better of this action the girl
vanished the band struck up madeloti

  he turned away from the saragossa of
swirling forms and walked to a tinsel-
wrapped post where he again sought for a
second glimpse of the blue-eyed pagan who
had toasted wine and bubbles

  his glance lifted to long rows of boxes
each was crammed with women with red
lips nd men in dark garments the tables


all-story weekly

in these boxes were piled high with empty
champagne bottles

  dropping his glance he yawned and
pressed his gloved right hand to his mouth
he decided to go down-stairs and look for
the bar

  he descended a thronged staircase and
glanced around a bovine individual whose
stout arms were laden with coats and cloaks
ran into him

  it was major garrick of the primrose
club

   holbrook by corks its vilos hol-
brook said the major  pon my word
it is come help me with these wraps
im up-stairs with gipsy cragen and her
father theyre my guests she dances-
gipsy cragen repeated vilos  was
she the one who gave the toast before they
played madelon

   sure she was know her

   no id like to

   how you down

   taxi i told the driver to wait

   we can use it take some of these
wraps and follow me were a popular
bunch up-stairs join us in another bot-
tle its here first and elbertas afterwards
know elbertas

   cant say that i do

   its a place down on johnson street
come on and ill show you some real life
in the raw

  vilos took a portion of the majors bur-
den on his own arm he followed the nod-
ding portly figure through the throng of
students and waiters

  airy fairy forms in gossomer gowns
tugged at the majors whiskers or struck
him on the back he chuckled in broad
good- humor he stopped once shifted his
burden and helped drink a risque toast

  vilos was forced to admit that there was
no better cicerone than the major his
good nature changed the entire evening
the women seemed lovely the lights
were brighter the dancers on the rock-
ing floor had all the graces of terpsichore

  mounting the broad staircase the two
men stood before the curtains of a box
the major reached out and slyly parted
these curtains he glanced inside then
said

   ah gipsy gipsy meet a frien of
mine-mr holbrook he came to the
west end for a little fun he saw you
dancing and-this is mr cragen mr
holbrook

  vilos touched the gipsys fingers bowed
over the table and offered to shake hands
hands with a man who was crouched be-
hind a rampart of bottles like a soldier in
a trench

  cragen clasped finally after an awk-
ward silence he presented a grimy palm
in the grip of which vilos winced he was
a big man in ill-fitting black clothes a
great livid scar ran from the lobe of his
right ear around and under a square-set
chin

  vilos sat down after the scrutiny he
leaned toward the gipsys bare right shoul-
der he heard cragen say to the major
 mike was here he got fresh with
the gipsy i dont like him a damn bit
when he acts that way he aint got any
business making eyes at my girl 

   easy whispered the major  go
easy ill see mike dugan he hasnt
anything on us

   im not so sure of that

  i am buck up get in the party
and well wait till he comes

  vilos noticed that the major had raised
his voice part of the conversation might
have been directed for the gipsys benefit
the two men started drinking

  leaning further forward and resting one
hand on the rail of the box without being
in the least familiar vilos studied the
gipsys three-quarter profile

  no single regularity marred her fea-
tures her mouth was full-formed heavy
warm her teeth were small there was
the suggestion of a past sorrow in the tiny
lines which spread from her lower lip

  he glanced at the dancers and then
moved nearer her chair she turned under
his scrutiny she flashed him a smile which
rippled through the dark blue of her eyes
like golden sunlight

  vilos lowered his stare and studied her
wrists and fingers all were slender-ele-
gant over-colored jewels crusted her
bracelets and rings they were not gen-
uine their barbaric shapes reminded him
where dead men walk



of a pagan goddess or an empress to aleric
at the sacking of rome

  he made a mental note and drew a con-
trast the gipsy was far and above her
worthy parent who had been so solicitous
as to her welfare in the matter of one
dugan

  turning with his eyes still lowered vi-
los glanced at the bottles on the table and
then up into the majors ruddy face gar-
rick stopped whispering to gragen and
sprang to his feet he dashed the curtain
aside and succeeded in catching the eye of
a passing waiter

   bring a magnum of sec i he ordered
 have it colder than that last bottle
quick now my good fellow

  vilos twisted in his chair leaned his
elbows on the table and peered over the
gipsys shoulder toward the rocking floor
whereon were the swirling dancers

   do you want to go down he asked
she turned and smiled  no mr hol-
brook i promised this dance to some one
else i didnt want to give it to him so
ill have to stay here you dont mind
 not at all id like to talk with you
some time

   some day you may come up to our
flat father and i live alone i keep
house

  the gipsy spread out her hands she
laid her fingers upon the table the mag-
num arrived the waiter drew the cork
with a towel and arranged clean glasses

  vilos lifted his glass and touched the
brim

   some night  bleated the major
 everybody and their skeletons are out
this is what mike dugan would call a
reunion and a renunciation

   who is mike dugan vilos asked

   mikes the whole show hes the
power behind the throne hes got all
the political graft he dont drink hes
said to own three saloons hell be over in
a few minutes he likes the gipsy

  vilos -leaned back from the table he
stared at the girls hair her head dropped
slightly she moved her chair to the edge
of the box she glanced down at the
dancers a step sounded near the cur-
tains were swept aside a man strode in

  mike dugan loomed crude and impos-
ing with a triple-chin a terrible jaw and
slate-gray eyes he swept the box com-
prehensively he moved a chair and sat
between the gipsy and vilos

  hello everybody he said hello
gipsy what not drinking

  the major rose

   this is mr holbrook he said  meet
mr holbrook mr dugan he and i play
bridge at the primrose he dropped in
for a fling of night life

  dugan turned and laid a hand on vi-
loss knee

   glad to know you friend of the
majors is a friend of mine

  vilos moved his knee and twisted in the
chair

   know any of these people asked the
politician

  vilos followed the hand which was lifted
from his knee and thrust in the direction
of the opposite boxes and the dancers

   i cant say that i do

   its just as well you dont of course
theres a few exceptions but many of them
are deep-sea men and con men and crooks
few of them work

  thats right exclaimed the major
theyre a study half of our literature is
woven around crime and the consequences
of crime i came very near being robbed
in chicago once

  vilos leaned behind dugan and said to
the gipsy

   theyre starting another dance

  she glanced knowingly at mike dugan
the big boss shelved down his brows and
coughed behind a hairy hand he crossed
his legs and uncrossed them he reached
out and wound his fingers around the stem
of a champagne glass

   go on he said

  she rose and took viloss arm as he
hastily got out of his chair a minute
later hecaught the fragrance of a warm
close head on his shoulder he felt a sup-
ple body sway and move with his own
they reached a position far from the box
where dugan leaned with pasty face show-
ing white against the tinseled curtain

   you must leave me she said  get
your coat and go home dont associate


all-story weekly

with major garrick keep away from
him 

   why ive known him for years

   he lives two lives you should not
associate with him

   but i can see you let me have your
address before i go

  she gripped his arm her hair brushed
his ear

   its in the telephone book call me
up some time take me back make your
excuses this is no place for you

   but you

   im different i was brought up this
way ive never known any other life

  vilos was silent until he had seated the
gipsy in her old chair he stepped from
her and pulled out his watch he stared
at major garrick

   im going he said  i had a corking
time good-by mr dugan and mr cra-
gen good-by miss cragen

   good-by said the gipsy without
turning

  vilos paused between the curtains he
glanced across the table the gross red
hand of mike dugan was reaching the
magnum toward the gipsy sparkling
liquid filled her glass to the brim a smile
passed between major garrick and the
boss the father frowned and made a
protest mike dugan finished pouring the
wine in the other glasses he set the mag-
num down and torched the gipsy on her
bare shoulder

  drink up exclaimed garrick

  vilos let the curtains swing he went
down-stairs where he secured his hat and
coat after a wait he found his taxi

  the ride up-town to his apartment was
not a long one it occurred to him that
he had been rude in the manner of getting
away from the box-party vague state-
ments concerning the genial major flooded
over him the man might be a rogue after
all

  he dismissed the taxi and woke the ele-
vator-boy he was lifted to the eighth
floor

  entering his own private hallway he saw
a light burning in the library he opened
his coat and stepped in through the por-
tieres

  an empty decanter and the butts of three
cigars were upon a table near the fireplace

  the air of the close room reeked from
port wine

  vilos called for gallagher he received
no response he strode back through the
curtains and softly opened the door of a
spare room adjoining his own chamber

  a polished stick a fur overcoat and a
badly soiled hat lay upon the dresser
clothes were scattered about the room
the faint light from the air-shaft revealed
a ruddy face and a long red nose pressed
within the cove of a white pillow

  hello uncle bishop said vilos
hello hello

  the old guardian did not move he
breathed with slow intakes his face
seemed strained and puffed there were
pouches under his eyes that vilos had not
seen there before

  softly closing the door vilos went to
the hall-tree and hung up his coat and hat
he glanced at his watch he yawned and
pressed his hand over his mouth

  it was time for all honest people to be
in bed he went the rounds of the apart-
ment opened the library window and then
undressed beside a narrow brass bedstead

  his drowsing thoughts were on the party
and the gipsy she seemed to have the
grace of a professional dancer he won-
dered if the wine he had drunk had not
warped his judgment perhaps after all
she would not be so charming in the cold
light of day

  he sank into sleep with his mind vain-
ly trying to fathom the reason for colonel
bishops alcoholic condition a cataclysm
of some kind might have happened in the
old mans affairs he was the sole trustee
of the holbrook fortune this fortune
although not large was viloss sole de-
pendence

chapter iii

 a vanished fortune

vilos awoke with the dawn creeping
down the air-shaft

he yawned then threw the cov-
erlet off his bed and sat erect he dropped
where dead men walk



his head in his hands he reviewed the
events of the night which had passed

  jerking his chin upward he stared around
the room the neat arrangement of his
clothes and the cuff-links and cigarette-
case on the stand showed that he had gone
to bed fairly sober

  he sprang from the bed and stepped
into a bath-room he lathed himself under
the flow of icy water he rubbed-down
with a coarse towel and started dressing
himself

  he wondered if the valet had come back
from the cooks and housemaids ball
he thrust his arms through the sleeves of
a lounging robe and started through the
hallway in the direction of the library

  parting the portieres he saw the evi-
dence that gallagher had returned to the
apartment the decanter and the cigar
butts had been removed a cheery fire
burned in the porcelain grate the table
had been polished and the rugs swept clean
of cigar ashes there were sounds from
the direction of the kitchenette that de-
noted preparations for breakfast the
dumb-waiters door opened and then was
slammed shut ice was thrust into the box
a milk-bottle clicked against another

  vilos pressed a button on the wall near
the fireplace

  gallagher appeared

   morning sir said the alert valet

   good morning you enjoyed yourself
i suppose

   yes sir i ad a good time sir

   what hour did colonel bishop ar-
rive

   hit was about eleven oclock sir i
waited for im i told im to make imself
at ome e was a bit tired sir yes sir
e was a bit tired

   did he say anything

   e did not sir e sat down in the
big chair there and started drinking ed
been aving an awful time with is ead
by the way e acted sir
falos glanced at the windows he
heard the rattle of the ash carts and the
early morning traffic it was the first
movement of a city turning over awaken-
ing and rising -

   you may bring the coffee and rolls

he said  serve them in here dont go
to the colonels room until i tell you

  the valet disappeared in the direction
of the kitchen vilos glanced around the
library he allowed his eyes to swing
from the bookcases to the ornaments in
the glass cabinets he studied each face
of the pictures on the wall they were
his ancestors who had helped settle mis-
souri and kentucky

  the coffee and rolls with a small ome-
let were brought in as he stood beneath his
fathers portrait he turned and sat down
when the valet drew up a chair before a
small table near a window -

  finishing the meal he rose bunched
his napkin lighted a cigarette and started
for the hall-room where the colonel slept
there was a small silk-shaded pilot-light
glowing in the foyer entrance near the bed-
room

  the door to this room was closed vilos
pressed it open and stepped inside the
morning light streamed through a narrow
window and brought oflt the details of the
colonels features

  the guardian of the holbrook fortune
had never been rated a handsome man
he appeared like a wreck on a pale shore
his nose was pressed deep within a fold
of the pillow his tiny spiked beard and
mustache was yellow-tinted and somewhat
awry

  there was a stale odor in the room of
alcohol and wine vilos stepped to the
window and threw up the sash he wait-
ed for the crisp fresh air to awaken the
colonel

  a slight movement under the covers was
followed by a wide yawn a choaking
sounded the old man hinged erect and
stared about the room

   wake up said vilos  get up and
take a shower colonel what in thunder
happened to you test night

   last night good god last night
yesterday

   come on get up 

  colonel bishop closed his pouch-hung
eyes he opened them to narrow burning
slits 

   that you vilos he asked

   yes its me




all-story weekly

   i need a bracer boy a tumbler of
whisky something has happened to me
its unbelievable it concerns the fortune
your dear father left to me in trust for
you

  vilos stared at the old man

   get up from that bed he command-
ed  get up and explain what you just
said have you been speculating

  vilos crammed his hands into the pock-
ets of his lounging-robe and braced him-
self

   all your money and all my money is
gone said the colonel as he swung his
legs from under the coverlet and sat on
the edge of the bed  its gone boy

   what do you mean

  colonel bishop passed his hand over
his eyes

  oh dear oh dear he said i
wish i had a drink 

  vilos frowned  see here he said
you must explain yourself i cant take
your word that all of my money is gone
how did it go what have got to show
for it

  the aged guardian rose and held him-
self erect by grasping the brass rail at the
foot of the bed he stared about the un-
familiar surroundings he dropped his
eyes to his spatted shoes under a chair he
raised his glance and steadied it upon
vilos

   i met a stranger he said slowly
 his name was robert bowdich he
seemed very pleasant

   how long ago was this

   three months ago i invited him to
my club he was at a red cross dinner
when i met him he came down to my
office soon afterward and we went out to
lunch together he had an automobile
at least i suppose it was his

   go on go on 

   we got acquainted he knew some
people that i did he told me one day
that he was looking for an engineer who
had come on from utah this engineer
had been given considerable stock for ser-
vices rendered to the small hopes mining
and milling co he made some kind of a
report for the company

   are you sure it was the small hopes

   it was the small hopes of utah that
i investigated it was all right the
brokers offered to buy it in at two dollars
a share

   and you invested all my money in
small hopes of utah

 no

  what did you do be clear

  colonel bishop reached and lifted his
trousers he drew these on as he swayed
back and forth he glanced about for his
shoes

   come now said vilos  i want to
hear more of what happened

   i bought the stock from the sick en-
gineer he was living at the hotel ald-
wich i happened to meet him accidently
he had his daughter with him they sold
the stock for a dollar a share ninety
thousand shares of it i held it for a few
days and then went down to the brokers
they told me-they told me there that i
had small hopes stock of arizona instead
of utah the certificates looked the same
 and small hopes of arizona

   isnt worth more than three cents a
share i was swindled

  vilos crammed his hands into the side
pockets of his lounging-robe and paced
the floor of the tiny room he wheeled
upon the old man and grasped him by the
shoulder

  it served you right he exclaimed
 but i dont see why you used my money
you tried to rob a mythical engineer with
a mythical daughter i suppose you fell
in with a shrewd gang what do you think
father would say if he were living
colortel bishop had no answer for this
question he succeeded in getting into his
clothes he attempted to brush his hair
and comb his mustache by aid of the half-
light in the room he turned with a weak
effort to hold himself erect

   youve notified the police asked
vilos

  yes i talked with two detectivesai
didnt tell them i had lost your money i
thought maybe they might arrest me if i
did

   they might have this is an awkward
situation for me sir

  colonel bishop reached upward and
f

where dead men walk



clutched viloss hand  youll have to
forgive me boy he said  im not my-
self this morning i think one drink would
steady my nerves then we can talk things
over

  vilos led the way into the library he
rang the bell for gallagher to the valet
he said

   bring a small drink of bourbon for
colonel bishop after that bring in some
strong coffee and an omelet and some grape-
fruit

  the aged guardian of the family sat
down heavily and reached his hand toward
the fireplace he dropped his face in his
palms

  vilos strode over the rugs he came
back and stared at the colonel there was
little pity in his straightforward glance

   have you got the stock he asked

    i left it with a detective

   what did the man look like who first
got you into this thing

   he looked like a prosperous merchant
he had been to utah he told me that the
mine was very rich it was-but the sick
engineer sold me the wrong shares

   its a new game you tried to double
your money and mine by tricking an ap-
parently sick man who was this man
who was his daughter

   the mans name at the hotel aldwich
was findelason his daughters name was
clarice she was his nurse i really
thought the engineer was dying

  vilos brushed back his prematurely gray
hair and bunched his fists a sickening
languor crept up his frame he steadied
himself with an effort

   was that the reason you tried to buy
his stock cheaply

  the colonel winced he raised his head
and dragged at the points of his mustache
he turned as gallagher came into the
library with a tray upon which was a single
glass of whisky and a small chaser

  gulping the drink in one swallow he
braced back his shoulders and handed the
servant the empty glass

   water sir asked the valet

   no no take it away

  vilos frowned

   boy said the colonel  ive been

through hell i went to atlantic city with
robert bowdich that was right after i
bought the stock from the engineer i sup-
pose i was lured away so that they could
cash my checks i drank more than i
ought to bowdich insisted on my being
his guest i realize the reason now

   did the detectives recognize any of the
men from descriptions

   no they said it was the work of an
organized gang it seems that other people
have been fleeced by the same group of
swindlers

  vilos stepped aside as the valet appeared
with the omelet coffee and grape-fruit on a
tray

   ill telephone detective headquarters
he said

  colonel bishop fumbled with a white
napkin  youre not going to tell them
that it was your money i used

   no ill just tell them to send up
their best detective there must be some
way to ran down this gang why theyve
ruined us

  the old man lifted a spoon and listened
as vilos raised the hook of the telephone
and asked for police headquarters the
curtain between the library and the hall did
not muffle the sound

  vilos came back to the library

   theyre sending a man up he said
 hes the same man you turned the stock
over to sweeney is his name

   yes thats the one hes red headed
and i think hes looking out for himself
he intimated that he might do something
for me if it was worth his while

  vilos suddenly thought of major gar-
rick

   i got tlo man he exclaimed  gar-
rick knows most of the people who live by
their wits in this town ill send for him
and have the two men meet perhaps the
major can suggest who robbed you i dont
believe that there are many men who would
answer the description you can give of
bowdich perhaps the major will know
it was a half-hour later when the detec-
tive from police headquarters arrived he
was shown to the library door by gallagher

   how about major garrick asked
vilos


all-story weekly

  gallagher shook his head as he stepped
into the room	v

   sorry sir he said  but the major
as a very important appointment e said
e would come any other time sir e says
es with a banker friend of is sir theyre
breakfasting at the club

   did you tell him that colonel bishop
was swindled

   hi did sir e seemed very much sur-
prised e said that e would like to see
you in private about the matter gal-
lagher glanced at the colonel as if the major
had said more over the phone than could
be repeated

   that  do said vilos turning toward
sweeney  come in he added  i
thought insomuch as i was concerned in the
swindle or my entire fortune was that i
had better have an understanding with you
i want you to get those swindlers and
bring them to justice what right had they
to escape so easily what has the detec-
tive department done in the matter

   say exclaimed the detective  say
young fellow i dont know who you are
and i dont care this man here comes to
us with a long tale of gettin trimmed by a
beautiful nurse a sick engineer and an old
boy with pink whiskers now that might
all be true we looked up the hotel ald-
wichs register the man and nurse or
daughter have gone the atlantic city
police wired that bowdich was there he
paid his bill and left thats all we have
got to go on what do you expect us to do
with that information

   you have the stock said vilos hotly
 you can find out where the checks were
cashed

   the stock can be bovc  from any
curb-stone broker for two clj a share
there were three million shares issued of
small hopes of arizona

   then the checks

   the checks were indorsed on the back
by colonel bishop all the crooks did was
to present them and walk away with the
money

  vilos turned toward the colonel

   did you indorse them

   i think i did i was drinking and
didnt remember

   how did it happen that you had all
that cash in one bank

   i sold the mortgages and bonds so that
i would be ready with the cash in case the
engineer would part with his shares
sweeney grinned and threw down both
hands

  hell he exclaimed theres one
like the colonel bom every minute you
havent got a chance to get that money
back i bet it went twenty ways those
mobs are made up of all kinds of actors

   what would you advise then asked
vilos

   forget it

   ill see the commissioner first you
people are supposed to protect the public
 the public be-

  vilos glanced at the detective he ap-
peared to be a very assured individual who
had gained his experience in a city where
competition is keenest his eyes had al-
ready taken in the details of the apartment
he had mentally weighed and appraised
every piece of furniture and bric-a-brac

  the colonel rose from the table where he
had been eating and advanced toward
sweeney

   youd help an old man out he asked
 that money was placed with me in trust
by my dearest friend this boy hasnt a
cent left in the world

  sweeney glanced at viloss gray-sprinkled
head  he looks as if he can take
care of himself he said  ill give you
some good advice it may lead to the re-
covery of some of the money offer a big
reward the reward will be conditional on
you getting back some of the stolen cash
then we can all get busy

   wont the detectives work without a
reward asked vilos

   sure theyll work were working all
the time but a personal ad in a paper has
done wonders in cases like this suppose
the mob fall out suppose theres a
squealer in the bunch suppose somebody
in the gang figures they didnt get a big
enough bit out of the swag

   yes well offer a reward said colonel
bishop

   now youre talking said sweeney
 how much
where dead men walk



   five thousand suggested vilos

   better make it ten

   well consult on the matter when you
are gone

  sweeney drew down his hat and turned
toward the curtains he hesitated for a
brief second

   ill give you another good tip he said
as his eyes ranged over the hall and the
portieres  this is a sure-fire one

   and what is it asked vilos leaning
toward the detective

   let the colonel stroll around the caba-
ret and sporting section of town have
him watch everybody ill hand in my
badge if he dont see one of the gang that
trimmed him in that time they cant keep
away from this city

  sweeney nodded his head he stepped
through the curtains and let them fall

   show him out said vilos to gal-
lagher  his last suggestion was a good
one well remember it sweeney

   it never failed chuckled the detec-
tive

chapter iv

 the finger of guilt

colonel bishop left the flat at
 pm he had sobered up and pre-
sented a respectable exterior to the
world he was about to face

  sweeneys suggestion concerning laying
in wait for the men who had stolen the
fortune was worth adopting vilos had
telephoned a lawyer who promised to use
whatever influence he could in the matter
of rounding up the swindlers

  nights shades came down the air-shaft
and through the windows before vilos had
gained complete control of himself the
colonels repeated statements concerning
the robbery furnished scant clues to work
upon the band of swindlers had prob-
ably scattered over the country there
was the first chance that one of their num-
ber might stroll through the cabaret dis-
trict in this event the colonel would be
on hand to notify the detective department

  vilos made an inventory of his assets
they were scant enough the money

which the colonel held in trust had van-
ished there was a small bank account of
a few hundred dollars and the furnishings
of the flat to fall back upon

  he studied these furnishings and grew
blue with the thought of parting from the
old things which had really made life worth
while the bay of the front room con-
tained the heterogeneous luxuries of the
orient he had traveled over the old
routes and had gathered numerous things
which matched his tastes and inclinations

  the rugs had been bought at agua and
benares there was one from daghestan
the portieres and curtains had enriched a
peers yacht who had been sold out at
christies in london five paintings by
gerome and scherer represented scenes
from the desert odd objects of ivory and
white jade were scattered about the front
room and the library there was an onyx
paper-cutter on a mound of envelopes
there was a dragon carved from a tusk
over the bookcase ran a row of tankards-
like german soldiers-fat and thirsty
around about on tables and stands were
limp-leather portfolios filled with music and
poems

  vilos knew that many of these objects
would not bring their worth at auction
he called gallagher and instructed him to
pack everything portable inside of three
days the books and personal objects were
to go in boxes the whole apartment was
to be made ready for the ruthless hand of
an auctioneer

  gallagher stared at his master and
gulped he brushed a genuine tear from
his eye he went back to the kitchen and
pulled a cork from a bottle he sat down
and forget the cares of this life in an alco-
holic dream that lasted out the night

  vilos stopped wandering about the
apartment-stopped fingering objects that
had taken him so many years to accumu-
late he squared his somewhat narrow
shoulders and glided through to the front
windows he glanced out

  the night view was of the best a shim- 
mering road ran below him streaked with
auto lights and a long line of flaming arcs

a belt of green marked a park which
sloped like an emerald field down to the


all-story weekly

 river north over the house-tops a monu-
 ment loomed in white purity south
 towered row on row of apartment buildings
 with turrets and towers clear-cut against
 the velvet of the night sky

   he turned away he glanced helplessly
 toward the narrow vista of the apartment
 a few silk-shaded lights were lit he
 studied these his eyes dropped to the
 rugs they swung along the line of book-
 cases and the morocco-bound volumes

   he crammed his hands in the pockets of
 his lounging robe and strode to his room

    there he dressed carefully in a dark suit
 he found an overcoat on the hall-tree
 putting this on and selecting a soft hat he
 went out and down the elevator

   major garrick was in the primrose club
 when he entered after a long walk down-
 town

   hello said the beaming major over
 his shoulder as he folded up the cards he
 held and indicated that he would pass the
 hand  hello holbrook sorry i wasnt
 able to come over when your man called
 whats that he was telling me about colonel
 bishop nothing serious i hope

     id like to see you said vilos

     i cant very well leave the game now
 suppose you wait in the reading-room

   vilos nodded bowed to the men about
 the table and made his way to the reading-
 room he sat down and looked over the
 current magazines he glanced at his
 watch now and then eleven oclock
 chimed in the little gold time-piece over the
 mantle

   a thought struck him that he no longer
 heard voices from the direction of the card-
 room he rose and glanced through the
  doorway the swift blood surged through
 his veins major garrick a lifelong friend
 had hastened from the club and had avoid-
 ed the appointment

    vilos took the matter as an indication of
 other insults to follow the major had
 heard or surmised that his fortune had
 been lost other men would shun him for

	the same reason

    striding swiftly from the club he spent
 the evening wandering through the park
 he finally crossed the town and entered a
 hotel near his apartment

  the bartender nodded and passed out
the old bottle of private-stock vilos
glanced at it and took a stiff drink he
tossed down the exact change and went out

  his thoughts cleared there was little
to do save to sell the contents of the flat
pack the rest away send gallagher off with
good references and then seek more modest
lodgings in a cheaper quarter

  it was possible that the detective depart-
ment would run down the swindlers it
was hardly possible however that they
would succeed in getting back much of the
money as sweeney had said it had prob-
ably gone many ways

  vilos went home and to bed he woke
refreshed from a deep twelve-hour sleep
he found gallagher in the midst of pack-
ing he passed the morning making ar-
rangements with moving people storage
warehouses and an auctioneer who prom-
ised to send an appraiser up as soon as one
came in

  leaving everything to gallaghers judg-
ment vilos dressed and started out the
thought had gripped him that there might
be something gained by paying a visit to
the gipsy she had intimated that she
knew more of the major than she dared
repeat she had a speaking acquaintance
with many of the members of the flash
underworld she might know who had
robbed colonel bishop of the money

  he entered a telephone-booth he found
her address by deduction there were
three cragens in the book one was a
merchant one was an auto dealer the
others address was given as on the east
side of the town

  vilos took a street-car and finished the
journey on foot he found the address
which was an ancient brown-stone tene-
ment

  it was commonly known in the city as
a  walk-up he searched the mail-boxes
and found one marked  cragen

  climbing three flights of gas-illuminated
stairs he came to a fourth landing upon
which were two doors he knocked at one
then tried the other a silence was fol-
lowed by footsteps a key turned the
gipsy appeared she stared through the
half-opened door at vilos
where dead men walk



 hello he said how do you do
 miss cragen

  oh it is you i wondered if i ever
 would see you

  i never forgot that dance and the warn-
 ing you gave me at the three students
 ball

 she smiled id ask you in she said

  but i think it would be better if we went
 for a walk will you wait until i get my
 coat

 vilos nodded a minute passed the
 gipsy appeared in a long tan coat and a
 blue hat

  lets go down-stairs she said

  father is not well you dont mind going
 outdoors do jou

 her eyes made a rapid inventory of his
 dark overcoat and well-cut clothes she
 glanced up then bent her head toward the
 stairway

  oh all right vilos said  id rather
 walk it isnt too cold for a long one
 either

 she led the way down the three flights
 of steps and out upon the street she turned
 and hooked her right arm in his as he
 hesitated and glanced east and west

  lets go where the lights are she
 urged  i hate this neighborhood

 he reviewed what he wanted to say to
 her as they crossed the avenues and ap-
 proached a secluded park

  i called he finally said  just be-
 cause i couldnt quite forget you or what
 you told me when we had that dance at
 the three students ball

  what did i tell you

  to keep away from major garrick

  is he your friend

  he was but now since i lost my money 
 i dont believe he is

 she drew her arm from his and walked
 along in silence until they had reached
 an avenue she turned and faced him on
 the corner

  lets go to some restaurant or tea-
 room she suggested  i want to know
 about you losing your money it must have
 been sudden the major said after you
 left that you had an independent income

  would it make any difference to you

  to me no everybody i know is

poor ive worked and even danced for a
living i keep the flat for father

   is he your only relative

   yes-mother is dead father earns
enough to make ends meet-sometimes a
little more

  vilos caught a slight note of hardness
in the girls voice he glanced at her the
lines of her mouth were drawn down the
lips were straight with thought

   well go to the old bombay tea-
room he said  we can talk things over
there i dont think we exactly understand
each other i have a premonition it is go-
ing to be awfully hard for us to get ac-
quainted our worlds are not the same

  she laughed and flashed him a sudden
glance  oh if youre broke she said

 and want a friend to take around now
and then and a pal im willing theres
only one man in this town i despise i hate
him because i do you know whom i
mean

   mike dugan 

  she nodded and led the way across the
avenue she stood on the curb and glanced
swiftly at the throng of pedestrians that
surged about the trolley stations there
was a haunting fear in her eyes

  they walked to the tea-room he held
her chair and took her coat he ordered
some waffles and a large pot of tea

   now tell me he asked as the waitress
disappeared  tell me why you are afraid
of mike dugan and of major garrick
have they any hold on you or your father

   they have more than a hold-they own
him body and soul

   but what is his business what does
your father work at

  she toyed with her napkin  he never
worked she said flushing  hes an in-
strument in the hands of a master i cant
tell you anything more except that i have
tried desperately hard to reform him ive
tried to be a lady how can i i havent
the education i was sent after a growler
of beer before i knew the alphabet i still
go after growlers of beer  high hats
father calls them

  vilos leaned back he too toyed with 
his napkin their glances met and locked
his was the first to drop


all-story weekly

   youre frank he said staring at the
white damask  i thought when i heard
you give that toast to bubbles that there
was something more to you than the other
girls ive met

 and now youve changed your mind
 yes for the better you seem to be
too sincere i suppose you wouldnt have
told me about the high hats if you werent
 suppose i told you i was a thief

  vilos dropped his napkin she had
brought out the word with direct emphasis
he glanced over the tea-room before meet-
ing her eyes

   youre not that he said trying to
fathom the depths of her earnestness
youd never be one unless you were forced
to it

    suppose i was forced to it

   you dont mean that your father-
she turned her head she exposed an
olive-shaded wealth of skin which disap-
peared beneath a collar of white lace

    heres the tea she said

  you havent answered-my question
he said as the waitress vanished

  a vmitre santay she mispronounced
as she lifted a glass of water  i learned
that from a french chauffeur he used to
come and take me riding thats all the
french i know i was eleven years old
then im overtwenty now

  vilos sipped his tea and wondered at her
frankness

   i didnt think you were more than
eighteen

  her blush was genuine she shaded her
lashes over her deep-blue eyes she smiled
faintly she lowered her glance to his right
hand which lay upon the damask she
watched him tapping the edge of the table
with his polished finger-nails

   what are you looking at he asked
conscious of her stare

    your fingers

   why

   she closed her lips a reflective expres-
sion crept over her face

   why he repeated

   oh because

   because why

   ive seen professionals with hands ex-
actly like yours

   pianists

   no

   what sort of professionals

   card-sharpers and-

   thanks said vilos dryly  im not a
card-sharper or a-what else were you going
to suggest

   to be frank she said as she glanced
at his hand  i have seen pickpockets who
had shorter fingers than you have

   good lord pickpockets

   yes they are wonderfully gifted they
can lift a poke or weed a leather or steal a
watch without anybody feeling anything
vilos did not know whether she had com-
plimented him or not he drew his hands
from view he leaned over the table

   ill remember that he said  i have
got a chance to make money after all i
thought my talents were limited to electrical
engineering i have got to go to work at
something

   you mustnt think i was in earnest
i dont believe that you would steal

  vilos shook his head he leaned back as
the waitress arrived with the waffles he
poured out more tea and caught the girls
glance upon his fingers

   you flatter me he said passing over
her cup  you really do i was never
cut out for a pickpocket

   we never know what we are cut out
for i should have been an actress i
was always crazy to go on the stage then
i thought of the movies but theres
father and the flat i just drift along

  he stared at her face it had become
wistful the pucker at her mouth was
very inviting

   im going to call on you often he
said  ill get a job as soon as i sell the
things at the apartment some of them
ill pack and place in a storage-warehouse
i can make thirty or thirty-five a week
at engineering

   how did you lose your money she
broke off a piece of waffle and lifted it be-
tween her fingers

   i lost it in a swindle you see i have
an uncle who is too easy for this world
he is my guardian id always drawn
checks on him and had them honored the
other night he came in and waited for me
where dead men walk



it was the same night or morning that
i met you at the three students ball he
explained how he had got mixed up with
a gang who fleeced him out of all his and
all my money their game was simple
do you want to hear about it

  she paled slightly he noticed her pallor
as she leaned into an alcove

   yes she whispered  im always in-
terested in those things

  vilos hesitated the air of the tiny
tea-room had suddenly grown tense he
had called upon the gipsy to ask her
opinion concerning the swindle he hardly
knew how to approach the subject

   you see he said  there were three
in it as far as i can find out one was
a sick engineer who was registered at the
hotel aldwich as a mr findelason from
utah the other was his nurse or daughter
the third was named robert bowdich
uncle met mr bowdich at a red cross
dinner why whats the matter

  vilos rose he almost upset his chair
as the girl clapped her handkerchief to her
lips and stared across the table at him
as if he had accused her of the crime

   i- he started to say

   oh this is awful are you colonel
bishops heir

   hes my guardian stammered vilos
 what do you know about the swindle
the girl lowered her napkin there was
a scarlet stain which showed double upon
the white surface she straightened her
chair she reached a wavering hand for
her coat  please pay the check and lets
go out she said  i cant stand it in here
any longer please please

  vilos glanced about the room he helped
the gipsy on with her coat he found his
own and his hat he left a two-dollar bill
for the waitress

  the crisp night air cleared his brain
he linked arms and turned toward the
lights of the town

   what do you know about the swindle
he repeated

   nothing nothing take me home
   but-

   take me home take me to the cross-
town car leave me and never try to see
me again you must you must

    but i dont understand what hap-
pened

    nothing happened mr holbrook i
 must go home thats all now leave
 me

   they reached the intersection of two
 thoroughfares a surface car clanged over
 the switch-points and stopped to discharge
 passengers the gipsy drew her arm away
 from vilos flashed him a final startled
 glance and then ran for the rear platform
 of the car she climbed aboard

   vilos stood still he watched the cross-
 town car going toward the east he turned
 a man hurried up to his side

    what were you doing with that wo-
 man asked an accusing voice  that
  girl-that thief

    what exclaimed vilos as he wheeled
 upon colonel bishop

    the lady you were with queried the
 aged guardian  why ive been watching
 for her all day shes the one that played
 the part of the nurse to the sick engineer
 in the hotel aldwich she helped rob us

    impossible

    id know that pretty face of hers in
 a million declared the colonel shes
 the queen of swindlers

chapter v

babes of grace

vilos reached out his hand and laid
it on colonel bishops excited shoul-
der

    you are mistaken he said  that
 young lady i just left is the very soul of
 honor she couldnt be the one who acted
 as a nurse to the sick engineer who robbed
 you youre entirely wrong

   colonel bishop stared at the lights of
 the vanishing car he took one step in its
 direction then hesitated some of his as-
 surance vanished as he noted viloss steady
 poise

    she was the one he said  that was
 in the engineers room at the hotel ald-
 wich why boy id know her in the
 dark 

   vilos shook his head he felt the colonels
 fingers on his arm


all-story weekly

   lets go and tell the detective sug-
gested the old man  he will be under that
arc-light

  vilos followed his uncle through the
traffic to where detective-sergeant sweeney
stood

  the detective was intently watching the
row of faces which flowed down a brightly
lighted avenue

  the colonel grasped his arm he swung
him partly around sweeneys eyes swept
from the old mans form to vilos

  hello holbrook he said whats
cornin off

 i just left a young lady whom the
colonel accuses of being one of the gang
who stole our money im sure she wasnt 
sweeney eyed the colonel he thrust his
thumbs into the holes of his vest

   he ought to know he said  hol-
brook ought to know the kind of company
he keeps colonel

  i say it was the nurse in the hotel ald-
wich said the colonel  i repeat that it
wasthe same woman

   and i say the girl i was with is the soul
of honor insisted vilos

   youre a hell o a help to us if she was
the same woman the detective stared
keenly at vilos  which way did she go
where does she live are you trying to
cover up something

  vilos saw the glint of steel in the man-
hunters eyes they flashed a momentary
suggestion of savagery the great red
brows shelved down the thumbs came
away from the vest holes

   where does this woman live he re-
peated

  a few rounders and theater-ticket specu-
lators edged toward the group of men
some of them knew sweeney they be-
lieved that an arrest was about to be made

  vilos twisted away from the detectives
grip he doubled his fists

  see here he said see here im
perfectly sure of my own business i met
that girl at a-at a tea-room i dont know
who she was or where she lives she got
on the cross-town car thats all there is
to it the colonel was mistaken hes
near-sighted

   you better beat it growled sweeney

 you want me to help you and you block
the trail at the first chance i got other
people to look after

  the colonel cursed helplessly he fol-
lowed vilos they stood before the lights
of a motion-picture theater

   you had better quit watching said
vilos  go to your club and forget the
matter im going home and help gallagher
pack up my things

   but that girl

   she wasnt the one you met in the hotel
aldwich ill answer for her colonel now
think are you sure

   she had the same face-the same walk
-the same tan coat i saw it in the sick
engineers room she is the same woman
vilos had pressed the point in order to
determine how much the colonel remem-
bered about the matter he gripped the
old mans hand and said earnestly

   dont drink too much ill come down
to your office to-morrow forget the girl
good-by

  he turned as he saw the colonel tug at
his mustache then moisten dry lips and
start for the garish lights of a saloon

   just a second uncle  he said hurrying
across the sidewalk  what description did
you give sweeney of the sick engineer
what did findelason look like did he
have a scar on his cheek was he a big
man with a heavy face and deep blue eyes
 no boy he was thin-faced and black-
eyed he hadnt been shaved for weeks
he had a terrible cough i was certain he
was dying

  good-by said vilos ill call you
up at your office to-morrow

  the colonel stared a tier the vanishing
form of his ward

   he was with the woman all right he
said  now why did he deny it

  vilos had asked concerning the sick engi-
neer on the chance that the description
might fit the gipsys father it did not
cragen was probably not involved in the
swindling of the colonel

  the walk up-town settled a number of
things in his mind he had struck an un-
expected clue which was both sweet and
bitter the gipsy had played the part of
the nurse in the hotel aldwich her com-
where dead men walk



panion in the swindle was unknown the
genial individual who had lured the colonel
to atlantic city was still to be discovered
he decided to hurry with the packing of his
things sell the furniture settle down in a
quiet boarding-house and ferret out the
affair so that he could recover a part of the
stolen fortune

  he made swift work of the packing
gallagher shed a few tears over the objects
of art as they were wrapped up and placed
in trunks and cases the auctioneer ar-
rived and with him came three appraisers
the figure they offered was one-fifth what
vilos had paid for the furnishings of the
flat he accepted it and received a check

  moving swiftly he sent gallagher off
with the trunks and boxes he bade good-
by to the superintendent and paid the one
months rent which was due on the lease
he went through the old rooms called up
the telephone company ordered the tele-
phone discontinued then went down the
elevator and left the keys with the girl at
the switchboard

  that evening he crawled into a narrow
bed of a select boarding-house which was
sandwiched between a theaters side door
and a ladys tailoring establishment of the
superior order the die was cast he had
come down from plenty to the bare neces-
sities of life the transformation had taken
place in brief time the city roared on as
if the event was not worth recording vilos
drowsed and slept through a night of use-
less memories

  the problem he faced in the morning was
the old old one of a man taking stock of
himself he sat on the edge of the bed and
had it out with his conscience he could
go to work at electrical engineering and
earn at the most thirty-five dollars a week
there were a number of firms in the city
who would be glad to employ him

  on the other hand he had a little money
and a wide assurance that he would be able
to force the gipsy to give the names of her
confederates or assist him in the partial
recovery of the holbrook fortune

  he decided on this line of action gal-
lagher had been taken care of with a very
good reference the colonel had a small
office in a down-town building where he

    	a-s

specialized in stocks and bonds and finan-
cial advice to investors it was not much
but the colonels expenses were small

  vilos rose from the bed and dressed he
decided to start the investigation by going
to the primrose club and waiting for major
garrick the major had a working knowl-
edge of the police their methods and he
also was on speaking-terms with many deni-
zens of the higher underworld he would
be able to tell more about the gipsy

  the doorman of the club nodded to vilos
and bowed him in the footman took his
coat hat and stick he hurried through
the card-room and the reading-room no
one was about that part of the club he
passed through to the elevator and was
lifted to the second floor where a number
of breakfasters were sitting with their news-
papers propped over their grape-fruit

  major garrick resplendent in a shepherd-
plaid suit and a red tie glanced across a
tiny table which was set well in an alcove
by the front windows

   good morning he said as vilos stared
at him  come sit down and join me
i hate to eat alone

  vilos stood erect until a waiter drew up
a chair he sat down and indicated to the
servant that he had breakfasted

   hows tricks asked the major poising
a fork  what did happen to your uncle
lets see his name was bishop-wasnt it
i think you told me about him once

   thats what i came about said vilos
 thats what i wanted to see you about
the other night he was robbed and i
thought you might know who did it

   i

   yes it was the work of a clever gang
they had a sick engineer and a nurse and
a steerer who took my uncle to atlantic
city

  the major flushed beneath his pink skin
he crossed his legs and touched a napkin
to his mouth his fingers trembled slightly
as he laid the napkin down  how much
did they get from your uncle he asked

   seventy thousand dollars almost all
of it was mine my uncle was the guardian
of my fathers estate

   and the old man fell for the sick
engineers game


all-story weekly

   he didv said vilos

   its a wonder to me holbrook they
dont appoint guardians for guardians these
days i dont know any quicker way of
losing money i suppose he bought stock
which was worthless i presume he tried
to do somebody else and got done himself
i always did like to see a sucker trimmed
vilos glanced around the room he had
detected a quizzical note in the majors
voice

   do you happen to know any gang
operating that swindle he asked  can
you give me any clue by which i can re-
cover the money

  the major reached and lifted a glass of
ice water he gulped twice before he set
it down and leaned forward

   have you a good description of the men
in the swindle

   fairly good said vilos  the girl
was blue-eyed and had dark hair the man
who lured my uncle to atlantic city was a
genial stout gray-haired individual with a
ready smile

   that would fit my description said
the major  but then there are many men
besides myself whom it would also fit

  the major smiled genially he beamed
and stroked his whiskers  i think i can
help you he said with a hearty voice
 ill see a certain party who knows every-
body in the swindling line hes a wonder
he goes deep-sea on the boats and they let
him in on all their games hes a sort of
dilettante on international swindling you
give me your address and ill send you a
list of probable suspects

  vilos wrote the address of his boarding-
house on a card and passed it to the major

   youre a very determined young man
said major garrick  i think you are up
against a hard problem though this is a
large town the world is so wide why
ive heard that the very best place to look
for swindlers and green-goods men and con-
men and deep-sea greeks and wire-tappers
is the lobby of about ten good hotels
stretching from here to cairo and tokyo
and frisco they are babes of grace and
migrate with astonishing rapidity

   babes of grace major

  yes occasional offenders who are in

the crime-game for the sport that is in it
now for instance what did that sick engi-
neer look like id like to make a bet hes
an actor

   he was dark-bearded and slim- vilos
started to say when the major was inter-
rupted by the arrival of a page with a card

  show him up he said tell mr
hickson im holding a place for him

  vilos rose hurriedly

   sit right down said the major  i
want you to meet mr hickson handles
stocks and bonds he is a bit of a sports-
man-but a good sort you know

  vilos turned he saw a loud-vested man
swing into the breakfast-room a cream-
colored pair of spats matched a hat of the
same shade a dainty bamboo cane was
hooked over an arm a black mustache of
two-weeks growth shaded a thick upper
lip beaded eyes as bright as a serpents
glided and darted from table to table they
swept the majors portly form as he rose and
said

   mr hickson meet mr holbrook-an
old club friend of mine mr holbrook was
just telling me that his uncle was robbed
by a clever band of swindlers you should
hear the details

  the dark eyes rested upon vilos they
bored through and through him

   glad to know you said hickson
thrusting out a cool slim-fingered hand
 frien of the majors is a frien o mine
aint many like the major hes a filly for
looks and as steady as a deacon

  vilos bowed slightly he felt somewhat
out of his element the two men had
that hardness which repulses with its very
brilliancy

   this swindle asked hickson as he
handed his cane and hat to the waiter
 how did it come off

   his uncle said the major  got mixed
up with a mob who sold him some bogus
mining stock not the kind you handle
you know but cat-and-dog stuff

   what was his uncles name

   bishop said major garrick solemnly
 mr bishop if you please

  ill remember that hickson said sit-
ting down very suddenly  in the mean
time major we might have a cocktail
where dead men walk



  vilos waited until three drinks were
brought to the table then he rose

  you send the information to the ad-
dress i gave you he said leaning over
the table  perhaps mr hickson can help
you out in that matter

  the major almost choked he stared at
the face of his companion then up at vilos

   what dyou mean he asked

  what i said exclaimed vilos as he
moved away from the table and started
blindly for the door he found the elevator
and descended to the main floor of the club
he was handed his stick coat and hat he
plunged through the doorway and started
walking rapidly toward the north

  the truth or a glimmering of the truth
had come home to him he followed the
natural sequence and found no flaw in his
reasoning the colonel had been robbed by
men who had decided he was a mark the
work savored of major garrick the genial
major had posed as mr robert bowdich
he had told the gullible colonel of the sick
engineer somewhere in the town mr hick-
son who answered the engineers descrip-
tion had played his role with the help of
the gipsy the entire swindle dovetailed
the meeting with hickson had started the
train of deduction in viloss mind

  he reached a park and sat down on a
bench his stick lay between his custom-
made shoes his eyes were on the trees
and the sky there was an open space
there as if some giant monarch had fallen
this space represented his faith in man
the double-dealing of the major had proved
the last straw

  there seemed no way to wrest the money
from the gang its one weak spot was the
gipsy she would not talk

  he lifted his cane and swung it idly back
and forth women in green suits and
broad black hats galloped by on well-
groomed horses autos honked beyond the
fringe of shrubbery the suns rays slanted
through the shrubbery and cast shadows
over the cement walk

  vilos steadied his cane he rose with
sudden resolve there was nothing to be
gained by guesswork there was a way to
prove if hickson and the major were con-
cerned in the swindle

  he had thought of telephoning colonel
bishop and having the old man come to the
club in order to identify the two men he
realized that if the police were brought in
on the matter there would be a scandal
which would involve the gipsy

  his decision was to go to the tenement
and lay the matter before her she could
advise him he held certain cards which
might force her to tell the truth

  he walked rapidly through the park and
crossed the town he sprang on the rear
end of a street-car which would fake him
south he got off the car and walked west

  through screaming children and red-
faced women he threaded until he stood in
the entrance to the brown-stone tenement
cragens box was filled with circulars
vilos pressed the bell and waited he saw
dirt-streaked urchins peering through the
entrance at him they eyed his cane as if
they had never seen one

  a burly man came down the steps and
opened the door he had a can under his
coat

   is cragen in asked vilos  i want
to see miss cragen

   cragens gone the man said thickly
 he moved away last night the daughter
went with him

   where did they go asked vilos
blankly

   you can search me-i dont know
down-town i guess was youse a friend
of theirs

   yes yes

   well then youse oughta know where
they went i wasnt a friend of any of them
queer people i say

  vilos followed the man out into the street
he glanced up at the rows of broken win-
dows he counted until he had reached
the fourth floor there was a series of three
empty windows there the curtains had
been removed

   would the agent know vilos asked
the man

   im the agent i tended to the taking
out of their telephone i dont know where
they went i dont care 

  vilos tucked his cane under his arm he
started westward he entered a slot-booth
and called up colonel bishop the old man


all-story weekly

promised to be at the primrose club within
fifty minutes his voice shook as he at-
tempted to hang up the receiver

  it was exactly fifty-five minutes when the
colonel sprang out of a taxi and came across
the sidewalk to the place where vilos was
waiting on the corner nearest the club

   are you certain they are the men who
swindled me asked the old man excitedly
 suppose they are not

   ill introduce you said vilos  that
will prove the matter

   hadnt we better telephone for sweeney
and have him waiting outside in case of
trouble

  no come on in they were in the
breakfast-room they ought to be in the
library now come on uncle 

  vilos led the way into the club he
stopped and peered into the card-room he
grasped the colonels arm and urged him to
the library no one save a bald-headed
reader was in sight

  vilos frowned and stepped to the waiting
elevator-boy

   did you see major garrick and a friend
come down he asked

   yes sir i did mr holbrook they
came down about an hour ago sir they
talked with the secretary sir then they
went out sir

   and where is the secretary

   hes not around sir he went out
sir

   with major garrick

   oh no sir he went afterward sir
i heard him say that the major was leaving
for asia or some place like that the
porter brought down the majors bags and
golf-sticks and things sir

   and he left in a taxi

   he did sir

  vilos stared at colonel bishop he drew
out a quarter and handed it to the boy
he led the way to the street where he
said bitterly

   i frightened them away

   then they were the men who swindled
me

   their flight proves it declared vilos
 i suppose the money will be all spent by
the time they return ill have to go to
work-or-

   or what boy

  vilos glanced at his right hand

   or hunt up the gipsy he said

chapter vi

 flannagans flats

vilos fell into the idle life of a
dreamer and a wanderer he browsed
through book stores and spent his
evenings strolling within the congested
canons of the city

  the boarding-house with its score or
more of tenants was a hive of loud laugh-
ter cabbage smells and white-faced women
who flitted through the halls in the morn-
ing with their beauty strangely gone over
the night

  vilos had a speaking acquaintance with a
few of the steady boarders they belonged
to the  trolley-circuit which consisted of
a number of vaudeville houses scattered
conveniently near the trolley lines

  he gravely listened to them and caught
a new note in the heart of the city they
were courageous and enterprising they
had traveled everywhere in the united
states the city was considered a godsend
compared to one-night stands at sage-brush
hotels

  their high good-nature and care-free life
caused him to take stock of his own some-
what narrow existence he went out more
often he visited the primrose club at
stated evenings his return to the board-
ing-house in full dress and crush-opera hat
a trifle out of fashion was usually heralded
by a voice from somewhere over the banis-
ter and an invitation to come up and have
some beer

  once a chalk-pale youth who had clois-
tered himself in a third-floor back room was
brought down between two heavy-set men
and was seen no more at the boarding-
house the jimmy-jawed landlady said that
he never had to worry any more about
board bills

  vilos found it necessary to first call upon
colonel bishop for money and then short-
ly afterward he had the trunks and boxes
brought from the storage warehouse and
their contents sold at auction
where dead men walk



  the jade and jasper and ivory had de-
preciated some of the cherished objects
of art brought less than he had paid for
duty on them it ras a frugal period where
luxuries were a drug on the market he
kept the portraits and paintings these
would not sell and they were the last of
his blue-china as he phrased it

  he found in his wanderings a little cafe
and restaurant which suited him in cuisine
and price it was managed by a father a
mother and a pretty daughter who waited
on the tables there was a bar in the front
but this did not prevent the place from
being both respectable and popular it had
not been spoiled by sightseers

  a night came when he sat in this little
cafe and stared over the tables toward the
heavy slate-gray face and eyes of mike
dugan there could be no doubt that it
was the boss

  vilos drew back against a wall he
partly hid his form by interposing a pillar
between himself and dugan who was dining
with a henchman of swarthy features and
oily black hair

  the boss was drinking lithia water he
was eating spaghetti with an awkward fork
he had evidently dropped into the cafe on
a ward tour

  the gipsys name and features flashed
through viloss mind he had given up the
quest for her the sight of dugan brought
back the picture of the girl dancing at the
three students ball it stirred the old
memories and the haunting sweetness of
their last parting

  he wondered if it were only yesterday or
six months ago when he had visited the
tenement he had idled the time and got
nowhere the major and his unsavory
friend mr hickson had not been seen
around the primrose club sweeney still
stood at the intersection of the thorough-
fares

   vilos finished his small bottle of red wine
he ordered a stronger drink he had taken
to drinking as a means to pass the nights
and days whisky he found let the brakes
off in a remarkable manner and whisky
was cheap in the city

  he watched dugan and the black-haired
henchman they rose before he had finished

the whisky he hastily gulped the re-
mainder paid the waiter and started to-
ward the front of the cafe

  dugan stopped and talked with the
pretty daughter - he was approached by a
youth in velveteen jacket who attempted to
sell him some  soul candy the big boss
roared an indignant protest which set the
gay spot of bohemia into laughter he
glanced around leered at the pretty daugh-
ter then passed out through the door

  vilos leaned over the bar and ordered a
drink he gulped this threw down a quar-
ter and braced his shoulders as he trailed
dugan and his companion under a narrow
elevated

  the way led southward to harmine
street dugan stopped and started whisper-
ing instructions to the italian the two
men stood blurred against the lights from a
saloon they separated as dugan pushed
open the doors and stepped inside

  vilos crossed the street and rounded the
comer he entered a back room and peered
over the low door which separated the room
from the bar dugan stood before a table
he was glancing at a man whose face was
scarred and whose black clothes were shiny
it was a full minute before vilos realized
that the man to whom the boss was talking
was james cragen-the gipsys father

  vilos stepped out of the saloon he took
up a position on the opposite side of the
street he turned his coat collar up to his
chin and drew down his soft hat

  children stared at him and went on
women passed with fetching coughs which
were meant to be invitations the city
roared with the passage of huge trucks
garish lights shone from pawn-shops and
second-hand clothiers push-carts lined the
thoroughfare further to the southward

  vilos caught a reflection of himself in a
glass as he turned and stared at the window
behind him he had not improved in the
six months which had ensued since the loss
of his fortune there was a slight run-
down appearance to his clothes and shoes
and hat there was a gnawing in his body
which was not there before  this desire
came from whiskyand cheap wines beer
had only added an occasional green-head-
ache


all-story weekly

  the wait for cragen to come out of the
saloon seemed endless vilos acted like an
amateur sleuth his hat was drawn down
too far his manner was furtive he went
back to the room and peered over the little
door at least three times each time he
saw the big boss and cragen deep in earnest
conversation

  and because dugan ruled the ward he
had a glass of vichy in front of him while
cragens great scar was livid from many
gulps of the strongest rye that big men
drink

  cragen was the clue to the gipsy vilos
remembered this fact and fortified himself
for a long wait he paced back and forth
he crouched into a hallway he studied
the time as shown by his watch

  it was eleven oclock when the big boss
strode from the saloon glanced up and
down then started walking rapidly east-
ward vilos watched him disappear

  cragen came out and lurched along har-
mine street vilos became a close shadow
behind him the work was amateurish
once the man turned and peered backward
he reeled and went on until he came to the
broken steps and narrow entrance of a tene-
ment

  he vanished-a deeper shadow within a
shadow a door closed vilos crossed the
street and leaned against an ash-can he
stared up at the row of poorly-lighted
windows

  then fittingly a form emerged from the
tenement and glided northward a feather
drooped from a wide hat it was the gipsy

  vilos followed her he saw her enter the
door to the side entrance of the saloon
where he had seen mike dugan and cragen
talking and drinking

  he opened this door and stepped into the
back room the gipsy stood by a small
slide through which a view of the bar could
be seen

   you she exclaimed wheeling and
staring at him  you here

   yes its i said vilos turning down
his coat collar and lifting his soft hat
 ive finally found you 

  the gipsys face blanched her hands
raised and pressed against her breast she
glanced toward the door

   i suppose you have people witk you
she asked

vilos shook his head and reached for her
hand  come let us get a drink  he sug-
gested  i want to tell you what has hap-
pened to me im down and out almost
she eyed him nervously

   you get a bottle of light port wine she
said  and well sit down ive got to go
in five minutes father just came home
and theres a man talking to him now
vilos shoved a dollar-bill through the
slide and received a quart-bottle wrapped
up he set this on the table drew up two
chairs and motioned for the gipsy to take a
seat

   what will you have to drink he asked
as the bartender came in

   something soft a ginger-ale

  vilos ordered the same he waited until
the bartender had disappeared in the direc-
tion of the bar

   i looked everywhere for you he said
 i went around to the old address and you
were gone i searched thetelephone book
and the new directory why did you try to
break the trail

  again she glanced over his form her
elbows rested upon the table she narrowed
her eyes and smiled with tiny wrinkles
forming from the corners of her mouth

   why because i was afraid you would
guess who i was i saw you talking to
colonel bishop when i caught that cross-
town car i felt that your uncle had recog-
nized me

   he did i told him he was wrong i
wanted to find out for myself though

   are you determined on getting back the
money your uncle lost

   ive forgotten about it

  she traced a circle with her finger on the
table

   that was well you did she said
loosening her tan coat and exposing her
neck  you see that kind of money has
wings its been spent long ago

   how much did you get out of it

  the gipsy traced more circles  so
little she said  that it wouldnt have
bought a decent gown you know there
are people hired for certain swindling opera-
tions like actors for their parts
where dead men walk



   gipsy youre too bright to be a tool
i found out that the sick engineer was mr
hickson and that the one who steered my
uncle into the thing was major garrick of
the primrose club but finding out wont
help matters i just wanted to see you and
get your advice about going to work at
something

  she glanced around as the bartender ap-
peared with the two ginger-ales

 a voutre saritay she said touching the
glass with her lips  well drink a toast
i dont think a woman is bad who steals
vilos drank one-half of his ginger-ale

   thats a queer code he said  who
taught you that

   father

   then your father is living by his wits
h yes he is well known in certain cir-
cles he would kill me if i went wrong
but he taught me to steal

  vilos saw her glance toward the side door
as a woman glided in with a can

   weve both come down he said  im
living in a theatrical boarding-house and
youre living in-

   flannagans flats or tenements rent
paid by the week in advance a fence in
the basement buys anything you bring to
him it dont make a particle of difference
what it is

   id like to move down here said vilos
she glanced at his hands in close-lidded
calculation

   theres nothing to stop you she said
 i think i shall ive been wandering
all over this town for the last five or six
months i havent met anybody who was
the least interesting the more i met the
more i thought of you

   youve been drinking

   yes

   was it on account of losing your
fortune

   well that started me but i wasnt get-
ting anywhere

  she studied his hands for a second time
she started as theside door banged her
face was white as she rose

   i must take back that wine she said
 im awfully afraid of somebody coming
in here and finding us together

   your father

  no

   the man who is up with your father

now

  no thats a man you know its
mr hjpkson a friend of the majors im
too frank but the man i fear is bigger than
any of them he has threatened to have
me arrested unless im more friendly to him
he and father are on the outs father says
that he will kill mike dugan if he keeps
running after me

  vilos pushed back his chair  why he
said  your father was with dugan to-
night	s

   yes i know he was with him theyre
always together but father has a reason for
that father is queer some day you may
know him and like him he thinks the
world of me

 but he lets you act as a confederate in
the majors swindles he lets you live
down here in this out-of-the-way place
you should be in a girls boarding-school
the gipsys eyes widened

    youre no one to tell me that she said
vilos followed her through the door and
out into the side street they turned the
corner together and started walking south
along harmine street a clock in a church
struck twelve slow strokes

  hurry she whispered as she thrust
her arm through the cover of his elbow and
dragged him over the sidewalk  father
will be furious

  her back glance as they reached flan-
nagans flats brought out the cords of her
neck her eyes were haunting

   looking for dugan asked vilos
yes if he came you would have to
get out of the way he is terrible he
holds father and almost everybody in the
hollow of his hand he knows too much
he is dangerous because he thinks while
other men are drinking

  i wouldnt get out of his way said
vilos

  you she exclaimed you - well
you dont know him as we do you dont
know him-

her voice trailed into a poignant silence
she lifted the bottle of wine and stared at it

 im afraid this is not the right brand
she said glancing up the street  i wonder


all-story weekly

if i better go back and ask the bartender
what kind father usually drinks

   let me take it back

   no i must hurry father and his
friend will be wonderingwhere i went im
afraid father will come down-stairs and look
for me good night mr holbrook you
can call some time when father is not at
home good night 

  vilos blocked the way

   why cant i come up and meet your
father he asked  i know him he
knows me we were introduced at the
three students ball by major garrick

   i dont think you had better come up
hes busy with a visitor

   ive met the other man too the major
and mr hickson were at the club one
morning

  her brow puckered

   they might think you were after in-
formation she said  you know you were
the one who was robbed-months ago

   ive given that up gipsy i realize that
the money was spent-that it went many
ways perhaps dugan got some of it i
just want to talk to you a while if your
father is willing ill go after another bottle
she hesitated and held out her hand

   promise me that youll not use any in-
formation against me and mr hickson
promise me that you will forget the part i
played as nurse in the hotel aldwich

   i promise said vilos  i never want
to hear ofit again its done i just want
to sit and talk with you i want to tell you
what ive been doing since i left my flat

   come on  she said

  vilos followed her through the door and
up the flights of gas-lighted staircases whose
worn carpets were dangerous to tread upon

  the gipsy pushed open a door without
knocking she entered and beckoned for
vilos to follow her he groped within the
narrow walls of a hallway and emerged injo
a room where cragen was lounging upon a
chair opposite cragen sat hickson-
debonair and cool

   ive met a friend said the gipsy

 hes an old friend she added as she
smiled knowingly at her father

 to be continued next week don
 that you will get the continuation ol

   cragen removed a cord-wrapped pipe
 from his mouth and rose with a muttered
 oath what thell he said what
 did you bring him here for

    he wanted to see you i met him on
 the corner explained the gipsy as she re-
 moved her coat  you know mr hol-
 brook mr hickson

   hickson bobbed his head  hello old
 pal he said  no hard feelings i hope
  none at all said vilos  i happened
 to meet the gipsy as she said and asked
 her to bring me up sometimes i find it
 lonely here in town

   hickson glanced at cragen he swung
 and studied vilos from the toes of his half-
 polished shoes to the prematurely gray hair
 that lay over his temples

   he shook his head  you used to be a
 regular collar-and-necktie boy he said
  now i dont know what to think are
 you looking for a little work in our line

    what is your line asked vilos

   both men laughed

    you know said cragen  you know
 he repeated heavily  hickson here could
 use a good man in some little work which is
 coming off pretty soon we need a man
 who has never been shown up and who
 hasnt been  mugged are you on hol-
 brook

     i might be arrested said vilos

    you cant be arrested were under
 protection you get ten per cent and pro-
 tection

    vilos turned to the gipsy

    l are you in it he asked

     ill go into it if you do she said  ill
 teach you everything i know she mo-
 tioned toward his fingers cragen and
 hickson leaned forward

  a swell bunch of mitts said hickson
  little nollie matches had the same kind
 he was the fastest pickpocket in the west
 cragen stroked the scar on his right
 cheek his eyes bored through vilos

     cornin in boy he asked

    in what

     a little speculation in pink pearls
    vilos felt the gipsys urging glance

ladies first

it is only fair to say right now that
catherine accepted mr brett with a
distinct condition she was to be merely
a companion to him in his last days he
cheerfully agreed to the arrangement know-
ing better than to expect anything more
at the time he was just four times her age

   but its worth it my dear just to have
you to look at he often assured her and
he meant it he made her his sole heir

  so as might be expected catherine soon
turned her attention to making use of the
million he had left her she found of
course that the particular strata of society
for which she longed rather frowned down
upon her she had been the millionaires
stenographer previous to their marriage

  whereupon she deliberately set to work
to win a man of her own age a man al-
ready within the charmed circle she had
brains as well as youth and beauty and she
proposed to spare neither

  she went about it very energetically tak-
ing prominent parts in several social-wel-
fare enterprises thereby coming in contact
with the people she sought to know but
she failed to make a hit with the younger
men had she been as well informed in
athletics or politics as she was in business
she would have have done infinitely better
and as soon as she realized this she pro-
ceeded to have a good cry changed her
mind entirely and began to look over the
field of confirmed bachelors

it was about this time that john bates
of bates  foster constructing engineers
decided to run for governor immediately
his opponents searched for facts with which
to discredit him and that is the reason wthy
philip foster his partner was thrust into
the public eye and before catherine bretts
notice

  philip had been the silent and incidental-
ly the thinking partner of the firm it
seemed his contact with the world had
been almost entirely through bates now
people learned that philip wras really the
brains of the pair

  of course it was the san francisco-to-
chicago tunnel which put bates  foster
on the world map before that they had
done everything in the engineering line
from installing the new pacific coast wave-
motor system to building the detroit air-
plane-starter tower they had nothing to
do with such propositions as the san fran-
cisco bay bridge they specialized on diffi-
cult work which other concerns were afraid
to handle

  that is where philip fosters brains came
in quiet retiring sort of chap though he
was he had a most astonishing imagina-
tion coupled with a truly remorseless logic
he could devise ways and means where all
other experts failed

  not to go into details but who except
philip foster would have had the nerve to
adapt the screw-tube principle to so huge
a project as the tunnel yet to-day when
folks on the pacific coast receive a ship-
ment of freight which left chicago just

toi


all-story weekly

twenty-four hours ago we may possibly
think of bates  foster and that will re-
mind us of bates but never of foster

  the bates  foster suite occupied the
entire ninth floor of the ballou building
on market street not far from the ferry
altogether it amounted to nearly thirty
rooms fully a third of which were given
over to laboratories for philip often had a
score of experiments chemical electrical or
physical under way at one time as for
the other rooms most of them were oc-
cupied by the small regiment of draftsmen
the firm required while the partners had
each a private office opening off a single
reception-room the knob on batess door
was worn smooth philips still looked new
the one was opened fifty times to the
others once

  catherine found these details immensely
interesting she learned that philip could
claim membership in the coveted set and
she quickly made up her mind that this
hitherto unsought because unknown bache-
lor must be won if she was to prove that
she was  qualified

  she did not believe that true love was
blind on the contrary catherine was
firmly convinced that the only genuine love
is that which develops between those who
have shown mutual fitness she believed
in love after a year or two of married life
during which both parties had proved that
they were worthy according to her theory
she couldnt possibly have fallen in love
with mr brett it was out of the question
for her to prove herself worthy of a man
old enough to be her grandfather

  so her apparently cold-blooded designs
upon philip foster were not so cold-
blooded after all catherine fully expected
that the affair would become quite ardent
enough in due time

  she learned that philip rarely left his
club appearing in society only when his
aunt gave some sort of an affair for a certain
orphanage by means of the most intricate
maneuverings which need not be gone into
here catherine contrived to attend these
affairs succeeded in getting an introduction
and even managed to hold philips atten-
tion

  she did it by talking business it re-

lieved him immensely to get away from the
small-talk people he had never mastered
the art of saying much about nothing while
seeming to mean it all and even though
catherines stock exchange chatter was
quite out of his line it was infinitely pre-
ferable to the other kind of embarrassment

  he studied her carelessly she was be-
tween twenty-five and thirty slightly stoop-
shouldered from her early life in mr bretts
office and singularly languid in her move-
ments this however was rather decep-
tive in actual fact catherine brett covered
a great deal tf ground in the apparently
lackadaisical fashion of hers whether she
were walking or talking she made every
move every word count heavily

  also she was really beautiful in a som-
ber wistful sort of a way a closer look at
her dark brown eyes might have revealed a
very slight tightening at the outer ends of
the lids and the deep indentations at the
corners of her mouth argued a strength in
reserve that one might mistake for secre-
tiveness her nose was very slightly arched
thin and yet not prominent probably be-
cause her chin was straight and sharply
pointed there was a single deep line be-
tween her eyes

  now philip foster was no adonis of
medium height and chunkily built he
showed many signs of too much indoor life
his face was pink as a babys his hands
as soft in fact he was dangerously close
to being plain out-and-out fat and for the
past fifteen of his thirty-five years he had
assiduously watched the scales keeping
within a five-pound margin which he felt
he must never exceed

  his whole manner was exceedingly gentle
and diffident  as modest and bashful as
a young girl the newspapers had said
and catherine found it quite true

  he had large blue timid and unasser-
tive eyes tucked away beneath a bulging
forehead his nose was really large like-
wise his mouth why use more delicate
terms the only thing about his face
which ever worried him was its lack of a
healthy tan he wasnt bad looking at all
catherine decided

  catherine also knew from the news-
papers that  the other half of philip fos-
the man in the moon



ter is his office it was an extraordinarily
complete thing it seems containing every
conceivable publication on every branch of
engineering the man was a human index
to all known data about the profession
principles he knew by heart while he kept
facts and figures at his fingers ends in
his office he was invincible away from it-
catherine would see

  they had not met many times before he
began to prefer her company she had the
tact not to compliment him in any way
upon his success had she done so he would
have been acutely miserable and all this
explains why since neither of them cared
to dance they often wandered into his
aunts conservatory

  on the night things began to happen it
was full moon philip himself picked out
a seat in the most secluded spot in the
place he expected to just sit and listen to
her talk as usual saying  yes and  of
course  now and then meanwhile thinking
of something really important he took
the place beside her quite without noticing
that they had to sit pretty close together in
order to fit the seat

  said catherine brett to philip foster

   isnt the moon beautiful to-night

chapter ii

as for the moon

philip stirred uncertainly and cleared
his throat  very handsome moon
beyond a doubt although he could
not help but add  theres one of jupiters
moons which i happen to admire a good
deal more

  catherine noted that his eyes were now-
fixed upon the big yellow disk with which
we are all so familiar summer time-con-
servatory-moon at least three conditions
for romance were fulfilled catherine low-
ered her voice

   what a soft light it is now once i
saw it from lick observatory and then it
had a cold hard look i didnt like she
shivered almost pitifully

   it is due to our atmosphere declared
the engineer thinking only of the softness
of the moonlight not of catherines chilli-

ness  up at the observatory the air is
much clearer than here

   dont you think it has something to
do with the warmth of the season sugi
gested the woman softly

   only in this sense he answered  that
theres more dust in the air during the dry
months

   she let silence prevail for a little while
then shyly  it always makes me feel
confidential somehow to watch the full
moon this way

  he looked at her blankly  confiden-
tial

   yes -moving a tiny bit closer to the
man  the moon seems so big and-
near i feel as though i could reach up
and whisper secrets in her ear

  the scientist gave a dry chuckle youd
have to reach about a quarter of a million
miles then said he adding regretfully
 i havent the exact figures with me just
now

  but - she looks so big protested
catherine provolcingly 

   very deceiving said philip referring
only to the apparent size of the satellite not
to catherines manner  shes less than
half the diameter of the earth so that her
actual area is only about one fifth he
added that he would look the matter up
the next day and mail her the data in more
precise terms

  she sighed in a manner which would
have opened most mens eyes  you sci-
entific people are always trying to see the
mathematical side of things she com-
plained prettily in a fashion calculated to
bring contrition at once  isnt there
something about the mellowness of that
light which - well which stirs thoughts
other than - other than everyday
thoughts

  he longed for a telescope  looks nor-
mal enough to me he admitted sorry he
could not see what she saw he never liked
to disagree with people  as for her light
-it isnt hers at all of course

  catherine pretended ignorance  whose
light is it then

    the suns reflected said the scientist
 thats why it doesnt amount to much
why it would take half a million such


all-story weekly

moons to equal the sunlight at least
something very close to that figure he
added uncomfortably

  catherine sighed again and philip real-
ized that he had not said the right thing
he was used to that feeling however and
simply waited for the next test of his pain-
fully limited conversational powers

  catherine had a notion to change the
subject entirely then thought better of it
 i wonder why poets often rave about the
 cold beauty of the moon  she mused
 theres nothing cold about her appear-
ance now she settled herself more com-
fortably in the narrow settee so that philip
was made freshly aware of her nearness

   nor is she cold he declared  the
moon is always a pretty warm place wher-
ever the sun shines on her no wonder
her day is fourteen times as long as ours
he reminded catherine that the moon al-
ways kept the same face toward the earth
and added that this peculiarity was due to
the great gravitational pull of the bigger
globe

  catherine opened her eyes wide then
closed them swiftly as she saw her chance
 she has nights fourteen days long what
a pity she has no moon 

   oh but she has returned the agree-
able man of science  the earth is the
moons moon mrs brett and a mighty
efficient one four or five times as big you
know

   then she went on with studied art-
lessness  it would be perfectly grand to
sit in a conservatory like this somewhere
on the moon just think of a night as long
as that and watching the moon with-
with- she stopped as though in great
embarrassment

  philip looked at her in perplexity not
once did it occur to him that anybody could
desire his company any longer than half an
hour he thought of something quite dif-
ferent

   a conservatory like this on the moon
he chided gently  my dear mrs brett
there can be no plant life of any kind there
no air or water besides the temperature
drops down to the absolute zero during
the long night he was on the point of
telling her just how cold the nights became

but could not trust his memory for the
figure

  once more catherine let silence have its
way for a whik and philip had just about
brought his mind back to the electrical
problem he had been trying to solve when
she broke in with

   just the same i think the moon has a
wonderful influence i know i simply can-
not watch her without feeling-oh differ-
ent i want to do unconventional things 
she finished daringly

   eh the engineers mind collected
what she had said  oh i dont see why
you should be so affected mrs brett this
astrological nonsense has no basis in fact
the only influence the moon has upon the
earth is in causing our tides

   tieds wondered catherine as though
shocked but philip did not sense the pun
he gave a short and to him wofully inac-
curate explanation of the tidal action

  this time catherine did not let so much
time elapse  i wonder why the ancients
used to call the moon  luna  she mur-
mured pensively

   why i cant say he said regretfully
  luna -latin word i suppose he
frowned  maybe its from the same root
as  lunatic guess it is

  she clapped her hands lightly  and
yet you say that the moon can have no
effect upon us she laughed delightedly
tantalizingly  although the ancients must
have considered that the moon was to blame
for everything foolish that happened

  he pondered this seriously so seriously
that catherine said as lightly as she could
 hasnt the moon ever inspired you to
recklessness mr foster

  instantly his face lighted up  oh my
yes ive had any number of ideas about
the moon for instance- he stopped
remembering that he was not talking to
bates but catherine taking care not to
appear too eager urged him to go on

   well this is it go to the moon and
build a large air-tight hotel nothing like
this conservatory more like an office build-
ing would have to carry all the water
from the earth but that is only a detail
oh yes answering catherines questioning
look  theres more than one way to travel
the man in the moon



to the moon merely a question of controll-
ing the right kind of power

   having the hotel id advertise a novel-
ty such as the world couldnt resist  go
to the moon and view the full earth
ought to make a hit with some of these
wealthy time-killers

  he kept right on forgetting that the
woman at his side was herself one of the
despised  time-killers  but the main at-
traction would be the difference in gravity
he briefly explained how the moons smaller
mass produced only one-sixth the gravita-
tional force of the earth  fancy advertis-
ing an indoor derby  come and see joe
dillon trot a mile in thirty seconds or
 watch annie kellerman dive five hundred
feet into six feet of water all quite feasi-
ble you know mrs brett

  id charge ten thousand dollars for the
trip including forty-eight hours accommo-
dations and get rich in a year

  catherine had all she could do to resist
his enthusiasm instead she commented
 you must be pretty anxious to get rich
he became acutely self-conscious he
made some lame reply and catherine brett
came to a conclusion which was not at all
unwarranted under the circumstances

  as she rose to her feet she took his arm
and gave it a friendly squeeze glancing up
at him in a knowing way which left him
badly puzzled for this is what she was
thinking

   he wants to get rich so that he can
match my million

chapter iii

wanted-a monument

among the late mr bretts business
associates was one who easily out-
classed all the rest he was a tan-
ner the leader of the western world in his
line and the practical dictator of the pacific
hide trade he became enormously rich
during the war through combining with
other tanners to secure hides at rock-bot-
tom prices on the one hand and selling
the product at utterly unreasonable prices
on the other

so it is not really necessary to tell a

name so well known david sulzman is
not likely to be forgotten in a hurry

  and catherine thought of him the very
next day after as she thought she had
divined philips ambition she recalled cer-
tain things she had heard mr brett say
of the aged tanner and she lost no time

  as a consequence david sulzman came
to san francisco one morning stepping
from the san jose train just like some com-
muter he was entirely without attendants
which was his invariable custom and most
people would have taken him for some high-
ly respectable but not very successful law-
yer of the old school

  for david sulzman then in his eighties
was not like other men of great wealth
he never even indulged in an automobile
although such a machine would often have
been of the greatest service to him  cant
afford it he would say in his low pleas-
ant perfectly steady voice

  but this does not mean that david sulz-
man was stingy whatever he had was of
the best his thirty-dollar shoes were made
especially to fit a pair of oddly shaped feet
he wore nothing but the finest of black
broadcloth

  yet his shoes were repaired with the
utmost care as long as they would hold
together his broadcloth was worn until
it shone as brightly as his shoes he did
not believe in using anything cheap but
neither did he spend five cents without
getting full value as to his generosity in
matters of charity and other qualities of
a more intimate nature they must be left
to others to describe we are concerned
here with the man the world knew

  he did not take a surface-car much
less call a taxi he walked from choice
preferring to spend several dollars worth
of time in an exercise he valued very highly
this despite the fact that he required a
cane and could move no faster than a
one-year-old child when he reached the
ballou building he was tired out and glad
enough to resort to the elevator

   mr foster does not see callers except
by appointment he was told in the en-
gineers reception-room  mr bates will
doubtless be glad to see you however

  he did not offer a card he secretly hoped


all-story weekly

he might be recognized but the people
in the outer office were all of a younger
set and none knew the rather striking face
of the old man although his white chin-
whiskers short stubby and  dutchy
ought to have stirred their memories he
shook his head about bates

   i know the custom he said in his
peculiarly soft voice  however it will
be necessary for me to see mr foster i
did not viake an appointment but merely
telephoned before i left san jose to make
sure that he would be here to-day

  so the old fellow was certain that foster
would see him mused a stenographer then
the word  san jose  did the rest  youre
david sulzman she said with genuine
pleasure and the old man was satisfied

  as he expected philip was willing to see
him the old man faced the younger
across a low clay-filled modeling-table at
which philip had been working when the
millionaire entered  a relief map of the
mount lassen reservoir system explained
philip  which we have just finished for
the volcanic steam power people

   you seem to specialize on big things
remarked david sulzman then as philip
made no comment  i have come to the
right man

   the right firm protested the engi-
neer with a smile  bates is the man you
should talk to really although i am more
than glad to have met you his eyes went
back to the clay

  david sulzman merely made himself a
little more comfortable in his chair  mr
bates may be a very clever man and no
doubt is said he with his deliberate gen-
tleness  but the thing i have in mind
requires something more than executive
ability it will take originality of the high-
est possible order

  philip waved a hand  bates will tackle
anything under the sun he declared  he
tells me what is wanted and i figure it out
which was a good deal for philip to ad-
mit to a stranger

   then what is the use of talking to bates
first the millionaire wanted to know not
a change coming to his voice  besides
in one sense this is a rather personal mat-
ter

   i have come to you because catherine
brett requested me to do so

  philip foster forgot all about his model-
ing he flushed deeply sensitive fellow
that he was and david sulzman judged
that he might give catherine an encouraging
word when he next saw her

   to begin with mr foster said the
old man not letting the engineer collect
words enough for a protest-to begin with

i must bother you by explaining my own
view-point otherwise you cannot be of
much help to me

   you know of course that i have a
good deal of money you ought to know
too that whatever truth there may be in
some of these magazine attacks on my busi-
ness methods the fact remains that the
world has had a great deal more leather
because of what i have done than it would
have had otherwise

   i understand that philip hurried to
comment  no thinking person underesti-
mates men of your stamp mr sulzman
but the millionaire was not looking for
appreciation  at the same time he went
on  i am not blind i realize that the day 
of the millionaire is almost past what
with income and other forms of taxation it
is not the game it once was moreover
and no socialist could have stated this with
more conviction than the aged capitalist

 from now on mr foster the world in-
tends to encourage the majority not the
minority

  now he became even more earnest

 many men of my station realize this as
fully as i do they know that the future is
to see the rise of the working classes they
know that progress must go on and on until
people will one day positively forbid the
accumulation of large fortunes for fear that
the welfare of the majority will be crippled
thereby

   and most of my associates have given
in with as good grace as they possessed
and to-day are helping in the education
drive as well as other ways to help lift
up the very class of people which they were
trying to keep down only a few years ago
yes he said very surely as philip
made as though to protest  it is true i
know-i tried to keep them down myself
the man in the moon



   but to-day it is different as i say
most of my class have turned to helping
the progressive movement hoping in that
way to win the good opinion of the people
a few of us are still bitter about it you
can still read a few reactionary journals
which even go so far as to urge slavery as
a solution of the labor problem

    personally said the millionaire a little
sadly  i cannot look at the matter either
way i am no longer young i lack the
kind of fighting spirit that would be re-
quired to stop this new progress besides
i cannot bring myself to it i-

  he stopped and philip gathered that it
was only the old mans pride that had pre-
vented him from taking part in the great
interwelfare movement

  he paused as though resting and after
a while went on  and yet like any other
man of ambition i am anxious to leave be-
hind me a name which will live as long as
possible i cannot depend upon my chil-
dren to perpetuate my memory the strain
may die out in another generation neither
can i expect my business to do it the gov-
ernment will take it over sooner or later
and change the plants name into a mere
number

  he said this with no bitterness

   now mr foster other men of wealth
have sought to immortalize themselves by
building libraries founding colleges and so
forth they do not seem to realize that
a democracy can do anything it chooses
with such things and if the people ever
come to believe that these millionaires did
more harm than good their names will be
wiped out overnight

  philip said  if all saw this matter as
clearly as i do mr sulzman you would
need have no uneasiness

   that is precisely what i mean de-
clared the tanner  it is because i have
so little faith in the good sense of the people
that i have come to you

   i want his voice rose for the first
time so that philip clearly saw what a
dominating figure david sulzman must
have been when younger- i want you
foster to devise something which will re-
sist stupidity which will guarantee that i
shall not be forgotten come what may

   i want you to do something which can-
not be undone something which will for-
ever remind the world that david sulzman
once lived in it i give you carte blanche
you shall have every cent i own if need
be the only thing i require of you is that
your work shall benefit the people either
directly or indirectly otherwise the sky
is the limit

   you mean -philips breath came fast
and his eyes flashed- you mean sulz-
man that i am to go as far as i like to
invent anything i choose build what i think
best so long as it works for the interests
of the people in general and at the same
time guarantee that they  shall not forget
who did it 

  as suddenly as it had come the old
mans earnestness disappeared leaving him
a little tired and almost cross his voice
became the same as it had been when he
entered

   you can do anything you damned
please foster within the law or outside it
so long as you make the name of sulzman
live

chapter iv

starting something

philip jumped to his feet and went to
his drawing-table where he leaned
over the board and began to kick the
legs of the table-his invariable habit when
anything especially interesting was on his
mind he had forgotten that the million-
aires call was due to catherine brett for-
gotten the understanding with bates he
subconsciously realized that sulzmans gi-
gantic proposition was over batess head
anyhow

   youre just the man ive been wanting
to get in touch with he said suddenly and
with the bashful smile which only came
to his face when he felt thoroughly at home
with the smile  fact is sulzman al-
though bates and i have pulled off some
pretty unusual stunts weve never been able
to take hold of my really big ideas and i
think ive got the one that  fill your quali-
fications 

 could you make it clear to me now


all-story weekly

or would you rather wait until you have
turned the matter over in your mind a
while the aged millionaire might have
been referring to the purchase of a pair of
socks for all the concern he showed the
world will some day be told how david
sulzman once cleared a hundred thousand
in ten minutes through his masterful ability
to handle large affairs in an unconcerned
manner

   but philip foster was immensely excited
 i think i could do it right now -coming
back to his chair sliding half-down into
the seat stopping in this position for five
seconds and then hopping back to the
drawing-table  that is in general terms
the details probably wouldnt interest you
anyway

   and within the next quarter-hour philip
foster had unfolded a scheme which sent
david sulzman out of the office in such a
nonchalant confident jaunty mood that
any one who knew him intimately would
have declared  hes just found out some-
thing that pleases him immensely but
those who sat in the train with him never
guessed that the old man with the quaint
goatee was already anticipating a dream
come true a scheme which would immortal-
ize him and by so doing influence the life
of every man woman and child on the

 	earth

   as for philip he went at once to his
partner it will be remembered that batess
campaign was a failure probably this tem-
pered his egotism for instead of disputing
philips action he meekly agreed that the
hitherto silent partner had best handle the
whole thing alone

   within a week a new organization known
as the foster construction company was
well under way arrangements were made
for receiving the products of nearly twenty
factories products of a rather curious na-
ture handled in such a way as to insure
very little talk and mean time superin-
tendents and foremen of exceptional ability
were secured by the offer of extraordinary
salaries while a veritable army of skilled
laborers was recruited in the same way

   philip went to see catherine a few days
after david sulzmans call he thanked
her formally for what she had done

   you will have to take the credit or
the blame he said with his diffident smile
 for whatever we do sulzman and i
youve thrown two men together who have
the same potential ability for getting re-
sults as nitric acid and glycerin 

  she realized that this was quite a speech
for philip and more than half suspected
that it was rehearsed-which happened to
be true but she said with just the right
amount of shyness

   i couldnt forget what you told me the
other night when we were talking about
the moon about-about your wanting to
get rich you know

  philip looked up startled ever since
sulzmans advent philip had given no
thought to the other ambition

   youre wonderfully- he stammered
at a loss whether to say thoughtful  or
 solicitous

  catherines face became radiant and she
swayed nearer to him

   why shouldnt  be she murmured
her eyes fixed on his next instant she
turned away as though aghast at her dar-
ing so she never saw the bewilderment on
philips face a moment later greatly to
her disappointment he said he would have
to say good-by

   going to be an outside man now for a
few months he told her his enthusiasm
mounted rapidly and he smiled almost con-
tinually as he spoke of the trip he expected
to make-an airplane flight to ecuador
to begin the next morning  expect to
reach quito at twelve thirty-five the next
afternoon said he happily  send you
some photos

  she held his gaze for a second before re-
marking very quietly  arent you going to
leave one of yourself

   why -a little flattered-if you like
ill put it in the mail as soon as i get back
to my quarters he moved toward the
door then his laggard memory finally
wrenching an item from his unused stock
of small talk he stopped short  have
you a picture of yourself which i might
have unconsciously he made the request
seem urgent

  catherine kept her face averted for fear
it might give her away she found a small
the man in the moon



 semiformal photo which emphasized the ap-
 peal in her eyes rather than the beauty of
 her face he took it from her with ex-
 travagant thanks

   and it was in just this mood that philip
 went to the door catherine accompanied
 him thoughtfully and as he looked back
 at her for what he knew would be the last
 time in several months there came over
 him exactly the same feeling he would have
 known if after several weeks of helpless-
 ness in a hospital he were told that he
 would get well

   in his joy and excitement he would feel
 like hugging the nurse in whose company
 he had been fearfully embarrassed before
 and to-night he was jubilant jubilant as a
 boy on fourth of july morning the fact
 that the  nurse  was a beautiful young
 woman of great wealth did not alter the
 case just as the man who is usually at
 ease becomes agitated when a real crisis
 arises philip foster ordinarily as shy and
  awkward - as an adolescent girl became
 perfectly at ease when the great moment
 came 

   and yet if catherine had taken leave
 of him in a sad or pensive mood he would
 not have done it it was largely because
 she smiled up brightly at him in her effort
 to hid her feelings that his exuberance
 reached the overflowing point

   well-see you in october then he
 exclaimed as they clasped hands and then
 to her utter amazement he swept her into
 his arms and gave her a boisterous kiss

chapter v

the moon backslides

 of course philip was thunderstruck at
 his presumption as soon as he had
 left the house he wrote a very
 contrite note to accompany the photo he
 had promised adding  i hope you do not
 consign this to the ash-barrel because of
 my folly last night then confident that
 he had dealt with the case in the most ap-
 proved manner he completely forgot about
 it

   two days later found him as he had said
 to catherine descending from the inter-

    	a-s

continental aerial stage landing at quito
he spent several days in this place getting
in touch with the various factors of his
enterprise

  before he left for the interior the first
shipment of supplies still m their original
cars arrived via the pacific submarine
freight companys service and the quito-
to-the-sea tunnel

  philip and his associates at once pro-
ceeded with the construction of a railroad
using the most up-to-date apparatus in the
work and employing a gang to every half-
mile with the result that two months after
the first shovelful was scooped a complete
equipment of rolling stock was plying over
the three-hundred-mile stretch of line which
lay roughly southeast of the capital

  meanwhile buildings had been put up for
men and machines and by that time philip
was hard at work in peru putting the fin-
ishing-touches on a huge electric power
plant high in the andes in all of this the
vast wealth of david sulzman figured con-
spicuously breaking down all governmental
interference and securing real cooperation
there were no serious delays

  philip had been away just five months
when a peculiar thing happened or rather
began to happen the general public was
the last to notice it the astronomers were
the first followed closely by the navigators
surveyors and others who had occasion to
watch the heavens with any degree of ac-
curacy it is said that some of the old
seafaring men along the water-fronts
watching the tides noticed it before any-
body else but that is unlikely what hap-
pened is this

  the moon began to slow up the month
began to lengthen the almanacs all fell
into disrepute for instead of rising fifty-
one minutes later each night as had been
the satellites average she now lagged be-
hind this figure until after a week her
average was over fifty-two minutes

  a small matter apparently but to any
one who knows how mathematically precise
are all the movements of the heavenly bod-
ies the thing was simply terrific in every
observatory all other investigations were
dropped entirely in order that the whole
staff might observe the new phenomenon


all-story weekly

the moon which for untold ages and with
unfailing regularity had circled the earth
once every twenty-seven days was actually
slowing down before their eyes

  the public had scarcely done with dis-
cussing this mystery before there came an
announcement which almost eclipsed the
first one it ran

   it has been observed in all parts of the
world that the daily revolution of the earth
itself is changing instead of twenty-four
hours our day is now twenty-three hours
fifty-nine minutes and fifty-eight seconds
long

  this did not seem possible could it be
that mother earth who had not been
known to vary the thousandth part of a
second in the regularity of her spinning had
really begun to speed up a bit in her old
days it took a long time for most people
to accept this until in fact a few depend-
able citizens had had a chance to watch
a few dependable clocks it was true
the day was shortening

  but the next thing -to attract attention
was noticed first of all by a class of people
who seldom pay much attention to scientific
affairs the folks here meant usually go
by the name of  spooners

   honey-how big the moon seems to-
night was the way the convention had
started among these people for ages and
ages now it came to have a new meaning
the moon certainly did look big

   its due to an optical illusion deary
was the usual explanation such as had been
given from all time  if there were no
objects on the earth between the moon
and you sweetheart it wouldnt look so
big

  but as night after night passed and the
satellite seemed to grow very slightly larger
each time there came a time when every-
body on the earth was aware of the new
marvel shortly there came a third an-
nouncement from the authorities an an-
nouncement somewhat delayed as a matter
of policy

   let no one be alarmed was this state-
ment  but the fact is that while the
moons speed has been decreasing her dis-
tance from the earth has also been reduced

   she is now twenty thousand miles

nearer the earth than she has ever been be-
fore she is falling toward us at the rate
of a thousand miles a day

chapter vi

the world awakes

the next three months were the most
extraordinary since the deluge never
before had the world been threat-
ened as it was now threatened for un-
less something happened to stop the moon
before she fell the rest of the way to the
earth most certainly the entire globe to-
gether with every living thing upon it was
doomed to absolute annihilation

  do not get excited the authorities
cautioned again and again as soon as the
announcement had been made  we will
soon discover the cause of this mystery and
then doubtless be able to remedy matters
keep cool

  but it did no good wherever there was
a mind with imagination enough to see
what this thing really meant there also was
fear it was impossible to keep up courage
in the face of that ever-nearing satellite
unless one had an especially strong mind
and those whose minds were strong did
their best to forget their own fears by try-
ing to quiet those of others

  the only thing had helped was religion
everywhere the churches were crowded to
the doors services were held every day
all day long vast crowds gathered on the
mountain-tops like the worshipers of old
and madly prayed to god to prevent the
disaster every soul on earth was searched
to its depths by the approaching catas-
trophe

  out of all that wild period there emerge
two facts which need to be recorded one is
the second ark a tremendous antigravita-
tional machine built by a syrian named
ben malik

  this is the end of the worldben
malik proclaimed like noah had done thou-
sands of years before the syrian went to
prodigious expense to get publicity  out
of the earths billions i shall be able to save
one hundred a hundred no more may
escape the anger of god let the devout
the man in the moon



assemble and examine themselves that the
fittest of them all may survive to start life
again on some other world

   people flocked to this call for weeks
the self-examination went on until nearly
half a billion of the less intelligent peoples
of the globe had gone through a winnowing
process which left just a thousand-half
men and half women-who were adjudged
equally competent to represent the human
race

  ben malik himself was not among them
he was a cripple and for lack of any bet-
ter method of picking the final hundred
the syrian decided to leave it to chance
 the lottery of the lord it was called

  but ben malik wanted to make sure
his was one soul in millions not only
was he willing to stay behind in order that
a better man might take his place but he
felt constrained to give his ark a trial trij
before the great event took place

   the trial failed the ark a hastily con-
structed affair rose to a height of fifty miles
and then broke under the strain of its own
machinery it and ben malik were totally
destroyed

   the other great result of that wonderful
period was the political revival obviously
the swift approach of the moon meant that
in a few weeks there would be no such
thing as political parties no such thing as
social caste no such thing as capital and
labor on friday the  th of october ig-
norance and wisdom alike were to perish
culture and rudeness were to be no more
poverty and wealth to come to an eternal
end

  and it did not take the world long to
see this as always the people of the
thinking middle classes were the first to
state the situation

    let us forget our differences was the
upshot of what they said  there is noth-
ing to be gained by contention now the
th of october will reduce us to a com-
mon level

   let us make the remaining days as
agreeable as possible

  of course there were many who took
this as a license among this class the
last few weeks were spent in rioting and
licentiousness which went past anything the

world had ever known before no attempt
was made to stop these persons law and
order were enforced only when the safety
of other people was endangered

   but the great majority of folks saw the
thing more seriously they saw that not
one of them could escape the calamity in
those days there was but one known method
of getting away from the earth and that
was the method used by ben malik who
had scoured the globe to get enough of a
certain element to make his single ill-fated
attempt

  and so it came about that because it
did no good whatever to think of self first
men began to think of others only a few
weeks till the end of all things very well
why not make those few weeks devoid of
misery why not fill them with happiness
so that when the end should come it would
find men with at least some agreeable
memories to take with them

 it was a marvelous thought partly it
originated in the churches partly with the
socialists and before long mankind was
gazing upon itself in amazement

  for the earth was transformed where
before there had been terrible poverty even
in the most enlightened countries now
every effort was made to relieve all suffer-
ing great hoards of foodstuffs held for
speculation by profiteers were distributed
overnight to the needy the same with
clothing building materials fuel and final-
ly luxuries if all was to be destroyed
why not make use of it first

   for the first time in history thrift did
not pay no one could gain by  putting
something by the aim now was to spend
spend for the good and the wholesome
spend for experiences which would leave
pleasant memories memories that was
what was wanted memories which would
make the next world worth while

  couples who had been postponing mar-
riage  until theres money in the bank
got married at once finding an infinite sat-
isfaction in knowing that the next world
would not be a lonesome place

   people of wealth who formerly had kept
aloof from those less fortunate who had
been enjoying their station in life as selfishly
as they knew how-such people suddenly


all-story weekly

found themselves longing for something
more substantial than memories of extrava-
gance instead-

  they began to find rare pleasure in help-
ing those who needed help they became
eager in their efforts to give happiness
shortly men and women of vast wealth
turned their magnificent homes over to
those who because of misfortune and weak-
ness had known nothing better than tene-
ments

  and a time came when people who had
previously thought nothing of keeping half
a hundred people from useful industry in
order that their mansions might be  proper-
ly served -a time came when these mil-
lionaires fought hysterically among them-
selves for the privilege of service for the
chance to make some one happy for a few
hours

  and another class of people who before
had gone aobut their work in a sullen spirit
convinced that their employers were rob-
bers were amazed to find a wonderful satis
faction in working as they had never worked
before they took vast pride in careful
workmanship got vast satisfaction from a
consciousness of service rendered well the
end should find them on the job

  memories memories of work well done
of something accomplished for the welfare
of others memories of the blissful look
that came to the face of one who had been
presented with a right long withheld above
all the knowledge of having done some-
thing at last to right the fearful injustice
of the world

chapter vii

made in america

philip foster had been away about
eight months when quite unexpected-
ly he returned he brought with him
certain intercontinental officials whose
names need not enter this account officials
who had been invited to the plant in ecua-
dor philip did not go home at all he
merely sent catherine an aerogram and
proceeded straight to washington

  on the same day and for the first time
newspapermen were permitted on the

grounds of the foster construction com-
panys plant they found that the word
 grounds  scarcely did the place justice

 tract  would have been more accurate
for there were about fifty square miles of
the wildest mountain territory all carefully
guarded by several companies of aerial and
ground patrols

  these reporters immediately transmitted
their negatives by the pacific wireless
photography service to the league of na-
tions daily screen news who distributed
the films to all parts of the earth by plane
so that philips little speech was flashed
before the public in several million talking-
picture theaters at the same time the re-
porters material was released

   friends and fellow citizens of the
earth began the engineer using the en-
glish language at that time the nearest ap-
proach to a universal tongue  in behalf
of my associate david sulzman i wish to
explain the thing that has worried us so
long and then get your judgment as to our
future course of action

    as i need not tell you the moon which
has been dropping toward the earth for the
past three months came to a halt night
before last and has since showed no mo-
tion whatever we seem to be in no dan-
ger now of that collision

   at the same time -and here a photo
of the moon took the speakers place on
the screen while his voice went on- at
the same time the moon has entirely ceased
her former monthly trips around the earth
and our day has been decreased to some-
thing like twenty-two hours

   now be patient with me but ive got
to remind you that the moon when she
finally did come to a stop did so on the
side of the earth opposite from the sun
that is to say we now see the moon each
and every night she rises when the sun
goes down and does not set till the sun rises
again eleven hours later

  philip need not have apologized people
never grew tired of hearing this incredible
fact put into words he hurried on

   as a result the whole world now en-
joys full moon every night only com-
pared to what we used to call full moon
shes a supermoon now
the man in the moon



   to-night the moon is only a tenth as
far away as she used to be and the screen
showed a small landscape of a part of the
earth with the satellite in the background
a hundred times the size she had been three
months before the moon was now an enor-
mous shining globe of tremendous bril-
liance and beauty seemingly near enough
to be touched with the fingers she occu-
pied a space larger than the bowl of the
great dipper

   if it were not for the fear she has
aroused continued the man of science
 wed appreciate her more the moon now
lights our nights for us as theyve never
been lit before we dont need artificial
lights now except for very special purposes
our country roads are as bright as our
streets ever were our streets brighter than
any cafe

   at the same time the moon has caused
our tides to become immensely higher and
our ocean waves much greater this has
compelled some of our seacoast towns to
rebuild extensively on the other hand it
has enormously increased the output of our
wave-motor system so that we are now able
to dispense with wood coal and petroleum
entirely in short the moon has made us
a present of enough power to turn every
wheel in existence and for all practical pur-
poses she has abolished night

  he made only brief mention of the great
religious and social revivals and their con-
sequences not that philip foster was out
of sympathy instead he was tremendously
glad to see justice brought about as it had
been he was before the people merely
as an engineer and as an engineer he talked
on

  then came the sensation the films
which had been sent from ecuador were
shown and for the first time the world
learned what the secrecy-shrouded enter-
prise had been

  the most important of the great group of
buildings which comprised the companys
plant was a giant dome-shaped structure
exactly like an observatory on a mammoth
scale within it and visible through an
open slot stood a colossal telescope that
is it appeared to be a telescope until its
nature was revealed

   this it was explained  is a device for
projecting large quantities of radioactive
elements to a distance it is operated by
means of electrical current taken from a hy-
draulic plant in peru and is capable of
exerting terrific force

  as this was said the  telescope  was
slowly brought to the horizontal and
trained upon a range of peaks several miles
away the scene was next shifted to this
range

   a small amount of power will now be
released went on the explanation

 watch closely the rocks on the top of the
nearest peak this was about a quarter
of a mile away

  next moment a wonderful thing occurred

a very large boulder apparently of granite
and weighing many hundreds of tons was
slowly toppled over by some invisible force
so that in a moment it was rolling and
tumbling end over end down the side of
the peak

   the power-plant is located opposite the
camera asthis was said more boulders
were dislodged and sent flying down-hill
until the air was thick with rock-dust
there was a slight wait till this had set-
tled then came the finishing touch

   watch the entire peak this time

  at first nothing could be seen nothing
appeared to be happening then very
slowly indeed a change occurred in the out-
line of the mountain another moment
and one could see that its upper half was
shifting before two minutes were up the 
entire top of the peak had moved out of
place among its fellows so that it finally
stood with one edge overhanging a deep
chasm

  and then while millions of people gasped
in amazement that whole vast mass of gran-
ite was tipped up up and over until it
toppled inertly into what had been the
canon at the same time there was a
sharp earthquake which was noted by seis-
mographs in all part of the globe

  then came a quick  flash  back to the
ray-projector where a streak of blinding
white light about two hundred yards long
was now being emitted from its orifice as
the picture came to an end the light began
to subside very slowly

  the voice and figure of philip foster
came back to the screen  i suppose
youve guessed it now said he with a re-
turn of his diffident smile  the foster
construction company is responsible for the
moons backsliding

   every day for the past several months
when the moon had passed the meridian
we have been playing these rays upon her
western or left-hand edge you will un-
derstand that the left edge of the moon is
her  front with respect to her motion in
space well for six hours daily that  tele-
scope  has been pushing with all its might

   thats why the moon has come to a
stop and why the earth has come to revolve
faster by turning on this power very grad-
ually each day and turning it off just as
slowly when the moon had set weve been
able to use ecuador as a fulcrum without
the knowledge of any one else on the earth
it was not until then that the supreme
audacity of the thing seemed to dawn upon
the scientist his face changed and a cer-
tain amount of determination came into it
as he finished

   ever since the moon fell to its present
distance of twenty-four thousand miles the
projector has been trained upon the center
of her disk instead of upon her western
edge in this way the moon has been pre-
vented from falling any nearer-the whole
matter has been calculated with extreme
care of course-and so long as our supply
of certain chemicals holds out we can keep
the moon just where she is i may add
that we have a duplicate equipment to
guard against accident

   now the future is up to you people
the company can keep the moon in its pres-
ent position for a year or it can proceed
to undo what has been done and restore
the moon to exactly its former position and
speed in either case the worlds entire
supply of the necessary materials will be
used up in the process

  he waited a moment before going on
in the mean time the feelings of those who
were watching and listening can best be
imagined what a choice he was offering

   however he continued now smiling
broadly  there is a third alternative it
is this

   that suitable sky-cars already com-
pleted and thoroughly tried out be sent
with men and materials at once to the
moons surface and once there this
equipment would proceed to make the
moons present position permanent

   it would be done by means of miniature
projectors using- however these details
are a little intricate you will find them
discussed in a pamphlet the company is
issuing you may take my word for it that
the method will succeed

   so there you are either we i keep
the moon on the job as a curiosity for
about a year and then let the smash come
or  we push her back where she used
to be right away or  make a real job of
it and keep her where she is as long as
shell stay

   take your choice i thank you

chapter viii

the man-

catherine had had plenty of time
to think it over philips lack of re-
sponse to her letters bore out her sus-
picions first aroused by his note apologizing
for having kissed her by the time cather-
ine had recovered from the astonishment
of philips announcement to the world she
had resolved to match boldness with bold-
ness she would demonstrate her worthi-
ness by being as audacious in her own
sphere as he had been in the realm of
science

  once more the considerate reader must
remember her theory of love and marriage
she was confident that ardor would come
out of such a rationally made union and
she made her plans in all sincerity sure
that nothing but good would come from it
all

  when philip reached california he pro-
ceeded to call at once upon all whom he
felt he should see he made out a list in
his methodical way mapping his route so
as to make every minute count his one
idea was to get it over so that his time
might afterward be occupied with some-
thing more valuable than social obligations

  he had figured that eight minutes pos-
the man in the moon



sibly seven and a half would elapse be-
tween leaving and reentering his plane at
the brett home as he ran up the steps he
was already estimating the amount of time
probably necessary for the next call in
each case he had taken pains to make sure
that the person he wished to see would
be at home at that particular hour

  but he suspected nothing whatever when
as he was announced at the brett drawing-
room he found the place already nearly
filled with callers he never did know that
an impromptu tea had been hastily ar-
ranged he only wondered that catherine
should have so many callers so early in the
afternoon

  he stood embarrassed as usual looking
over the people before him there was a
small knot of women in the further corner
the butler spoke his name and with re-
markable speed the knot untangled reveal-
ing catherine herself at the center of the
snarl

  she gazed at the returned hero as though
she were entranced she stood there for
exactly the right length of time to get every-
bodys attention then her face changed
she gave an enraptured gasp and in half
a second had crossed that room as it
seemed on wings

  just in front of philip she paused for
the briefest possible instant peering at him
as though to make sure her eyes were not
deceiving her then she gave a tiny happy
hysterical laugh and swayed suddenly
toward him he involuntarily thrust out
his arms the fixed smile was still on his
face

  and then her arms were about his neck
and his about her shoulders the scientist
had no time no warning no chance

   phil my dear  cried catherine brett

  of course it is all old news now but its
a bona fide part of this account and there-
fore must be mentioned by this is meant
the remarkable end of the whole foster-
sulzman scheme

  in one way or another the people of the
world managed to express their choice of the
three alternatives philip had named in
the more advanced countries the thing was
done by direct vote of the citizens them-

  selves in others where the majority were
not capable of forming an opinion it was
done for them by their representatives
whether political or ecclesiastical

  and when it is remembered that the
moons previous position and motions had
had a very definite influence upon religious
history in some lands it is really remark-
able that there was not more opposition
than did develop however even the
brahmans finally came to see that the
masses would be greatly benefited by the
electrical power which the moons new loca-
tion would insure practically the whole
world agreed to making the  new moon
as it was called a permanent institution

  consequently philip and his associates
after remaining in the united states about
two weeks returned to their plant with the
league of nations itself backing their work
however those two weeks were extremely
significant ones

  philip was daily in catherines company
he had of course felt obliged to go through
with the thing according to catherines lead
his disposition would not allow anything
else

  she had explained her theory he had
been unwilling to argue about it and one
day he found himself asking her to fix the
day quite without knowing that she had
manipulated the conversation so as to make
him do it

  they were to be married as soon as he
came back from the moon this was set-
tled a week before he started and during
that last week the scientist looked at the
matter just as cold-bloodedly as catherine
had looked at it some time before
v he saw that catherine brett was as un-
like himself as any one could possibly be
at first he argued that  opposites attract 
then he began to look for some one point
on which they could agree a sort of home
base to which they could fly in case of
differences

  there didnt seem to be any neither
he nor catherine was in love with any one
thing even in love of country they dif-
fered for while catherine was an orthodox
american philip was an internationalist as
might be expected in a man of his type of
mind


all-story weekly

  as for simple elemental animal attrac-
tion-even catherine was obliged to admit
that as yet she didnt care for philips em-
braces more than say her brothers she
may have been right in insisting that all
this would come in time but philip con-
tinued to look for  something to hitch to
and he couldnt find it

  on the other hand he found plenty of
real obstacles catherine liked poodles he
philip loved children also he was pas-
sionately addicted to trap-shooting and
very apt to get up at two oclock in the
morning during the winter in order to slay
ducks and for this kind of insanity cath-
erine had an absolute horror she had had
a relative hurt in a hunting accident and
she would certainly worry every minute

  in petty matters-which often loom pret-
ty large-there were more objections philip
was inclined to be stout and liked to have
the house warmed to precisely sixty-eight
degrees or lower catherine being slender
required a temperature about six degrees
higher moreover-dont laugh this is
deadly serious-philip was a great lover of
the photoplay which catherine simply
could not tolerate

  of course they respected one another
philip stood in awe of catherines social
prestige and business acumen while she
fairly worshiped his profession but philip
did not agree that catherine in throwing
herself into his arms had thereby matched
his own boldness

   what you did was old old stuff he
might have told her had he been conceited
enough which he wasnt  what i did
was absolutely new

  but philip never realized what a terrific
effort it cost catherine to make her actions
appear natural on that occasion only a
woman could appreciate that supreme play

  and only a man could comprehend to the
full the mental and moral agony the man
went through before he finally began the
moons transfer

  so neither understood the other and
the great difference between them can best
be stated by simply remarking this that
whereas catherine was not aware that she
did not fully appreciate philips feat yet
he plainly saw that he could never properly

  value hers it was the old old distinction
between the mind that has ceased to expand
and the mind that is ever expanding

chapter ix

-in the moon

it was done nearly half the moon was
gone-the half the world had never seen
and now was never to see it was blown
into space by the steady pressure of what
are now known as  fosters rays at
times the cloud of powdered rock-dust was
clearly visible from the earth as the mate-
rial was ejected from the surface

  tt is only necessary here to add that the
insignificant gravitation of the moon was
not enough to pull any of this dust back
to the surface it was hurtled into the
void never to return

  in this way just as philip had outlined
the mass of the moon was decreased to the
exact point where the suns pull added to
that of the earth amounted to just enough
to keep the moon in place as we look up
at the immense disk above us to-night-al-
ways there night after night turning what
once was blackness into continuous twilight
-as we look up at her we take it for
granted that she will always look just like
that that she will forever continue to circle
the sun instead of the earth the younger
generation will find it hard to believe that
she was once a pitifully small object giving
only a hundredth part of the light she now
gives

  of course she is only half a moon now
as a result of what philip and his associates
accomplished but the half that is left is
the half which people have always seen

  perhaps it should be mentioned that mini-
ature projectors were used to propel the
heat-and-cold-proof sky-cars through space
buoyed up on those irresistible rays of in-
visible force the vast loads of men ma-
chines and materials necessary for the work
were transported quite without difficulty
in fact up to the very last day the whole
enterprise was carried off without any loss
of life and with only a few trifling acci-
dents that made the last days record
even more of a shock to the world
the man in the moon



  for upon the return of the last sky-car
to the earth people were startled beyond
measure to learn that philip foster himself
had lost his life just as the work was being
completed

   he left the sky-car dressed as usual
in a protective insulated suit taking
enough oxygen to last over an hour so
ran the official report of the superintendent
who immediately wired a copy to catherine
 he said he intended to take pictures of
a near-by crater before its destruction

   no one saw fit to watch his actions he
was out of sight for perhaps half an hour
then some one saw him on the edge of the
crater taking photos he again disap-
peared it was thought that he was return-
ing to the sky-car as he knew that the crater
was next in line for the projecting crew

   but just as the men were sweeping the
rays in that direction three men in the sky-
car plainly saw mr foster standing mo-
tionless half-way down the inner slope of
the crater out of sight of the workers there
was no mistaking his suit it was different
from the others and before the three men
could warn the crew the crater was wiped
off the moon

   mr foster probably did not suffer for
the reason that the shock of the rays would
certainly have caused concussion of the
brain a thorough search of the locality
was made as soon as the rays were stopped
but quite without results at this moment
the unfortunate mans remains are now fly-
ing through space in the direction of the
constellation hercules

  and yet before the last of the sky-cars
had put a thousand miles between itself
and the moon a strange sight would have
met the eyes of any person who might have
been left behind there were no telescopes
aboard the car which would have shown the
thing neither was any one on the lookout

  directly beneath the sky-car on the
patch of the moons surface which the ma-
chine had just quit there was a stir and a
movement in the soil presently a large
square section of the sun-lit material was
in actual motion and before the eyes of
the mythical beholder a cavern was re-
yealed in the solid rock of the satellite

  a minute passed and then a figure clad

in a suit the exact duplicate of the one the
three observers had seen destroyed clam-
bered lightly to the surface and turned the
big glass eyes of its helmet up toward the
fast-disappearing sky-car it was the figure
of a man of medium height inclined to be
stout who slouched somewhat even as he
sat on the edge of the pit

  no one needs to be told that it was philip
foster and a glance into the cavern would
have told the whole story the place was
stocked with enough supplies of all sorts
very scientifically selected to last one man
a lifetime

  presently the engineer disappeared to re-
turn with the framework ef a small hemi-
spherical building which he at once pro-
ceeded to set up over his cavern when
finished some time later it provided him
with a neat little combined observatory
drawing-room wireless-station and living-
room all incased in glass

  to-day an unusually fine and powerful
wireless tower stands in the mountains of
california and under the direction of john
bates sworn to secrecy the news of the
world is daily transmitted into space on
the moon a former fellow citizen hears
what earths billions are doing

  all about him is desolate wilderness the
sun shines continually just above the east-
ern horizon there is neither day nor night
always the dark side of the earth is toward
him he sees very little of the globe he re-
nounced he never talks to a living soul
although he makes a great many talking-
machine records why we need not try to
tell

  but he has a great deal to be thankful
for he has plenty to eat and to drink the
air he breathes is chemically pure he al-
ways has the great black above him every
star shining with vast greater brilliance than
we on earth ever know and beside him
at all times is his beloved library the con-
densed compendium of all the information
that is worth while to him

  and back in batess office in his safe is
a sealed document which is to be opened
only in a certain contingency in the vaults
of a well-known bank rests a large chest
in which among other things is a duplicate
of this document


all-story weekly

  and-mark this-so far as any one on
earth knows there are not enough of the
required chemicals in existence to produce
the  foster rays  once more the moon
will never be visited again

  as we enjoy our satellite this evening if
we happen to possess extra keen eyes we
can detect a short dark streak across the
face of our moon a streak which no as-
tronomer ever saw in the old days and
if we use a small opera-glass we can see
just what it is

  for the foster construction company
made a thorough job of the moons trans-
formation all the while that the crews
were blasting on the other side another

the

crew of chemists was at work on the earth-
ward face look closely through that glass
and this it what you will read

gift of david sulzman

  but although many of us will utter the
old guess about  the man in the moon
and many will recall the supposedly cragic
fate of the californian engineer only a very
very few will know that there is now an
actual bona-fide flesh-and-blood being on
its surface that an american citizen now
lives there its sole inhabitant and the only
genuinely independent man in all creation

   for he of all men is absolutely safe from
the other sex

 clancy

george plummer was the day
clerk of the towaco house george
was also the night clerk the boss
fixed it that way himself without consulting
george about it the boss figured that
with afternoon naps up-stairs and uninter-
rupted dozing while at the desk george
could accomplish continuous clerking with-
out injuring his health or efficiency and
with much comfort to the bosss bank-roll
the boss was right

  there never was much doing at the to-
waco house anyway you see towaco is
a no-mans-land somewhere on the erie
only traveling men stopped off there and
they didnt stop to sell goods they stopped

for a rest before going on or back stop-
ping at towaco was just a bad habit

  george plummer napped and dozed for
six months then one afternoon something
happened a splendid touring-car thun-
dered up to the towaco house and a big
forceful-looking middle-aged man jumped
out and strode into tire size-two lobby a
glance showed that he was not a traveling
man in fact he had all the atmosphere
of being somebody-the big boss of great
enterprise

  george snatched his undersized body
from the chair rumpled his mop of tow
hair and stood blinking at the big man
with his peculiar blue-green eyes
out of his head



   do you want a room sir he asked

   do i look as if i did the big man
came back with a broad grin  i want
some lunch young man ham and eggs
pie and coffee-quick this shack looked
like regular ham and eggs so i stopped
got to bust into the sky-line again in half
an hour get a move on-stagger

  george staggered

  the big man was very red in the face
it was evident that despite the dryness of
the country he had found some hard stuff
somewhere he insisted that george come
into the dining-room with him and sit op-
posite while he punished the ham and eggs

  as many men will under such circum-
stances he talked at great length he used
george as a kind of peg on which to hang
his loquacity and without any particular
reason he told george all about himself
it seemed that the big man really was
some peanuts in this world and was taking
a motor trip through unexplored parts of
the country to rest his mind

   i judge that you are a self-made man
sir george ventured to remark

   self-made and hand-made replied the
ham-and-egger as he rose and lit a fifty-
cent cigar  sure you bet thirty
years ago i hit new york without the price
of a shave-and now look at me kid i
had an idea and i took a gamble with my-
self any man can do the same look at
napoleon lincoln j caesar all did the
same thats the dope kid its up to
you you got a damn funny face but
youll get over it au resseyvar

  george plummer stood on the porch and
watched the car until it disappeared then
he went and sat behind the desk but he
no longer dozed for some reason george
was now very wide awake what was that
the big man had said and hinted at was
it possible that george plummer and op-
portunity could have a date after supper
that evening he asked the boss to hold
down the desk while he went out for a
while

  george went straight to the towaco
public library-open evenings and pre-
sided over by myrtle wild yes that was
her very own name and myrtle wasnt at
all wild she was a nice little scout with

only one bad habit-she wore her hair ac-
cording to the movies and as the style
changed with every picture her pretty
brown hair had a rather tired look from
being mussed up and rearranged so often
besides this bad habit she had a failing-
she seemed to like george plummer

  myrtle was the only girl in towaco who
considered george as a possibility  all of
which george was totally unaware george
was the kind of male person who is dread-
fully formal polite and impersonal with
girls

   good evening miss wild said george
 i have here a small list of books which i
should like to obtain

  myrtle gave him the double-up-and-
down-and-back again she sighed there
was no gleam of special admiration in his
eyes the effect of the latest style was quite
lost on him she looked at the list it
contained these items   the life of na-
poleon  the life of lincoln  the
story of a self-made man  how to
succeed

  why george plummer myrtle ex-
claimed  you sure have laid out some
reading for yourself-and never been in
here before well we have them all
 say why dont you come to some of our
parties

   ill be delighted to some time miss
wild replied george  but im very
busy just now ill take those books and
rim along

  thus it happened that for the following
six weeks the boss found george with his
nose eternally buried in a book

   hes got the book bug-gone on a regu-
lar litry jag said the boss to the trav-
eling men  seems to have some idea but
wont loosen up about it

  george napoleoned during the morning
lincolned in the afternoon self-maded and
succeeded in the evening at last he came
up for air and one evening took the books
back to myrtle

  but the next morning mr plummer de-
veloped a new phase of himself he in-
dulged in deep thought the boss found
him wandering all over the place in a
trancelike condition then a few days
later he took to writing hour after hour


all-story weekly

   ive got it  said the boss to the travel-
ing men  hes writin a book-the story
of his life guess he wanted to see how
them other guys did it

  george continued to write each evening
in his small office back of the desk he
tore up a lot and rewrote but hour after
hour he wrote on in his round careful pen-
manship at last he seemed satisfied with
what he had written and one day he packed
the dozen or so sheets of mysterious dope
into a large envelope and mailed it a
week passed and another during which
time george presided over the desk with
the abstracted air of a man who waits on
great events

  monday morning a letter addressed to
mr george plummer arrived from new
york it was brief

dear mr plummer

  we have been greatly impressed by your re-
markable letter we shall be glad to see you if
you can come to new york

very truly yours

bender  warren

  george read this note with a calm serious
expression for just a moment there was
a gleam of triumph in his blue-green eyes
but that was all he sought the boss

   mr thompson he said  i am sorry
to leave you but i have been called to
new york i shall take the noon train

  the boss stared at his clerk

   what the h- then he paused as if
a sudden light of understanding had come
to him much to georges surprise he
shook hands with him effusively

   so you made a go of it eh and none
of us ever suspected that we had one of em
right here in towaco regular litry guy
eh well george im sorry to lose you
but maybe a whirl in them litry high spots
will do you good

  then the boss rushed off to confide in a
traveling man

   george did it he said  some pub-
lisher guy in new york has bought his life
wow

   where do you get that junk asked
the traveling man disgustedly  youre no
fool thompson whats the real an-
swer

but the boss turned away without re-

plying and went up to his own room
there behind closed doors he spread out
on the table numerous torn and discarded
sheets of foolscap which at various times he
had abstracted from george plummers
waste-basket

  what george had written in his round
careful- hand seemed to cause his boss much
unholy joy

   some document he remarked  the
league of nations aint got anything on
this 

ii

  about seven oclock the following eve-
ning a serious-faced slightly undersized
young man wearing a free-and-easy suit a
soft hat of no particular shape and car-
rying a shiny new suit-case walked into the
lobby of the big hotel mammoth on
broadway manhattan being used to all
sorts of things the mammoth did not
shudder or grab for an ammonia sundae
beyond giving him an oh-look-at-it smile
the mammoth plainly was not interested in
him and showed no wild desire to welcome
him eventhe bell-boys failed to plunge
forward and take his bag they strove to
please but there were limits besides the
young mans appearance did not suggest
large tips

   a hick from hickville said one youth
nudging a companion

  get onto them pants said another
 seagoing-an aint been pressed since
never

  meanwhile the hick from hickville
without any sign of being flustered pushed
his way through the crowded lobby to the
desk

  a polite but cynical-eyed clerk felt com-
pelled to notice him

   what can i do for you sir he in-
quired

   a room and bath-not too expensive
said the hick

   didnt you put in a reservation the
clerk asked in such a tone that he might as
well have said right out you certainly
are a hick

  no i didnt think it would be neces-
sary here said george quite unaware
that he wore a hickville label
out of his head



  the clerk considered him for a moment

   well he said finally  i can let you
have a small room five dollars a day
he swung the register around and offered
george a pen

   havent you anything cheaper than
that george asked

   our cheaper rooms are all full let
me suggest sir that you try some smaller
hotel

   ill take that five-dollar room said
george as he meekly signed the register

  one of the boys now felt constrained to
pick up the shiny bag and escort its owner
into the elevator--hurriedly george was
shot to the top floor in the room he
handed the boy a dime

  the youth stood and stared at him

   isnt it enough george asked

   well said the boy  i could use a
quarter-if you could spare it boss

  george removed the dime and replaced
it with the desired quarter as soon as the
boy was gone george sat down on the bed
and took out a note-book and pencil he
made a note of the dime-quarter trans-
action also a note of the fact that he
should have made a reservation

  fifteen minutes later the hick from hick-
ville stepped out of the elevator into the
lobby he still wore the free-and-easy suit
but was minus the hat he wore no vest
but displayed a pink shirt a soft collar and
a black string tie he stood for a moment
rumpling his tow hair his blue-green eyes
roving the lobby with an oddly intense
purposeful light in them half the lobby
bumped into him and a girl waiting to
keep a date with her reporter friend tried
to vamp him just to see what would hap-
pen but being bumped and vamped evi-
dently went over georges head

  he strolled up to the desk and spoke to
an assistant clerk

   are all those people occupying the
lounges and chairs registered here he
asked

  the clerk accustomed to all kinds of
cock-eyed questions sighed deeply

   i really dont know sir he answered
feelingly  but ill have them all paged and
find out if you like

   thank you but never mind said

george taking out his note-book and jotting
a jot

   whats the big idea asked the amazed
clerk

  but george had strolled on

  a rattle of jazz from the far corner drew
him he had a hunch that the violent mu-
sic came from the dining-room and he was
hungry he made for the entrance then
found himself halted by a red-plush cord
stretched across the doorway several men
and women were standing there awaiting
admittance

  on the other side stood the captain with
his hands behind his back calmly inspecting
the group-and mentally figuring how much
each would cough up

  george waited two or three minutes as if
to see whether anything was likely to hap-
pen as nothing did happen quietly he
unhooked one end of the cord and was
about to ease himself in

  then something did happen the cap-
tain pounced on george while lesser captains
hovered close the captain gently but firm-
ly pushed george through the ropes and
back where he belonged

  perhaps you have a reservation sir
he remarked in a tone which plainly asked
 can such things be

   no said george  but i should like
to have dinner right away im stopping
here you know

  the captains eyes said  is it possible
but he unbent slightly and said aloud
 let me suggest that you try the gentle-
mans grill down-stairs

   thank you-i guess i will said george
meekly-but out popped the note-book
again and right under the captains puzzled
nose george jotted himself half a dozen
lines

  he went down to the grill here he
found no cord the grill captain just hid
him away in a far comer without any de-
lay and kindly began to compose a dinner
for him

  but george suddenly inspired by a
memory stopped him

   look here  he said  ham and eggs
pie and coffee-quick get a move on-
stagger 

  the waiter a red-eyed jugo-checko


all-story weekly

gasped for a moment it looked as if he
were going to bust george plummer in the
eye but he regained control and with
many long hot speeches to himself went
for the towaco feed

  when it was all over in the grill george
strolled up to the lobby again and ap-
proached the cigar-counter where he bought
a pack of cigarettes

   but this brand doesnt cost this much
miss he said to the girl who drew trade
there

  she eyed him pityingly but condescend-
ed to explain

   youre paying hotel prices-five cents
more on everything say aint you never
been in a hotel before

   certainly george answered  ive
worked in one

   mills asked the girl

   no replied george  i have never
worked in a mill-i said i have worked in
a hotel-

   oh wait-let me get my handkerchief
i gotter cry-i gotter-oh gawdj 

  george stared at her solemnly then
out came the little old note-book having
jotted he turned away while the girl looked
after him in pop-eyed wonder

  strange to say in spite of the fact that
they continued to treat him as the original
hick from hickville george stayed on at
the mammoth for a week he never went
out but was a species of indoor pest-he
and his jot-book the bell-boys made bets
as to where george would next appear-in
the cellar on the roof or standing star-
eyed in the lobby

  however on the morning of the eighth
day of his stay george showed an unex-
pected but welcome intention of at last
taking the air he telephoned then actual-
ly he went out half an hour later george
plummer presented himself in the offices
of the law firm of bender  warren

                      

iii

  george was ushered into a private office
and found himself facing a tall lean man
of about sixty-five-a man with worried
eyes nervous scattered hair and a twitch-
ing gray mustache jim bender famous

in the yale club and elsewhere as  ball-
em-out bender glared at george and
motioned to a chair opposite the big desk

  sit down mr plummer sit down
he said then after another glare jim
bender leaned back in his clair snatched
a handkerchief from a pocket and furiously
mopped his brow as he muttered  i
thought as much 

   i beg your pardon mr bender re-
marked george politely

  i said it is a rotten hot day said
bender his mustache twitching

   it certainly is a little warm mr-

   and i say its rotten hot roared ben-
der clutching the handkerchief very much
as if he wished it was somebodys neck
 now mr plummer listen to me in
the first place i want you-and everybody
else for that matter-to understand dis-
tinctly that i am only an agent in this
business you are here according to the
positive orders of my client orders which
those who know him know better than to
question he is johnny archman-maybe
you have heard of him or read of some of
his doings in the newspapers

  george suddenly sat up his chest
swelled

   you-you mean john j archman the
millionaire he gasped

  i do jim bender snapped again
mopping his brow  johnny archman
known as the eccentric millionaire-blast
him he leaves all his affairs in our hands
and if it wasnt for the fact that we need
his account here and that i have an af-
fection for the old hound id like nothing
better than never to hear of him again
well recently johnny got the controlling
interest in the mammoth-and unloads the
direction of the place on me i know
nothing of hotels-and archman knows
less but what does the old fool do but
suddenly pulls one of his wild stunts gets
aboard and rides it full tilt and when
archman gets going like that no one can
stop him or talk to him until hes had his
fling no matter what it costs him

  bender paused to mop and glare then
he roared on

   some idiot gave johnny a book about
efficiency ideas new-fangled business no-
out of his head



tions and such things he went crazy
over it and without ever having been in
the place suddenly decided that his new
toy the mammoth was horribly misman-
aged and could be made twice as profitable
as it is

   he rushed in here one morning and
ordered me to find a new man to take
charge of it for a month-a man with new
ideas and not a new yorker told me to
scour the country well young man it
happened that very morning your letter was
lying on my desk i gave it to archman
he read it through-then he slammed his
fist on it jumped up and yelled  heres
the man-the very man we want get
him-put him in charge at once 

  george swelled some more he made a
sweeping gesture and rumpled his hair he
breathed hard

   then i suppose mr bender he said
solemnly  that you-you will arrange an
appointment for me with mr archman

   i would like to-i most certainly would
like to replied jim bender again clutch-
ing the handkerchief  but i cant the
day after he read your letter johnny sailed
for south america

  georges face fell  then i am to un-
derstand-

   you are to understand that according
to my clients orders i am putting you in
charge of the mammoth for a month it
was an explosion rather than a statement
he jabbed at a button and a stenographer
came in he dictated a memorandum
there he said tossing it to george
 thats your authority ill write to mr
marshall the manager to-day

  george clutched the memorandum

  the stenographer deftly concealing her
thoughts went out

   now how about salary bender
asked

  george considered

   well he said  i-i think i shall ask
for-for fifty dollars a week-until i make
good

  bender choked

   all right he said finally  i think
mr archman would approve of that
suddenly he opened a drawer and took
out the document that had been mailed

in towaco he glanced through it the
first page was a letter to the management
the second page was headed  how a
big hotel should be conducted new
ideas in management

  bender put down the screed and gazed at
george

   where did you get this dope mr
plummer he asked

   i worked it out myself said george
modestly  i-er-i devoted a lot of
study to my theories and have every con-
fidence in them i might add mr bender
that i have spent the past week at the
mammoth-observing i have here a little
book of notes which i should like to read to
you

    lets have it said bender

  out came the jot-book it was pretty
full by this time george read his notes
and comments he read for a few minutes
then paused as if for encouragement

  jim bender was looking at him with
something like awe in his worried eyes

   remarkable insight mr plummer he
said as he rose and held out his hand  i
see you are already on the job well go
to it and do your damnedest

  there was real feeling and pathos in
his voice as he shook georges hand and
conducted him to the door

iv

  reaching the street george plummer
did something that never in his life
had he done before he hailed a taxi
jumping in he instructed that he be driven
to the hotel mammoth with all possible
speed the driver seemed to have his
doubts but remarking to himself that you
never can tell from the looks of a man
he whirled george up-town at a good clip
reaching the hotel and flinging the man a
dollar and ten cents george hurried
through the lobby and up to the balcony
floor where he stepped briskly into the
private office of tom marshall the man-
ager

  but here his briskness blew up for the
time being-the manager had gone out on
business and no one knew when he would
be back george frowned then retired to


all-story weekly

his room requesting to be informed the
moment mr marshall returned

  in reality marshall had gone to the
races but his secretary did not consider
that it was any of george plummers busi-
ness

  tom had had a bad day at the track
the last race was his meat according to
the dope he put ten yellow ones on an
alleged horse but it was not a horse the
animal whatever it was looked like a
horse and made a pretense of running like
a horse but the result was too pathetic
even for cuss-words tom felt so sad that
he stayed out on long island for supper
and did not get back to the mammoth until
after eight in the evening

  he was in a bad humor entering his
office he was startled and annoyed to find
sitting there a tow-headed hicklike person
whom he recalled having seen around the
hotel recently before he could speak the
hicklike person rose and addressed him
briskly meanwhile offering him a folded
paper

   good evening mr marshall said
george  ive been waiting for you all
afternoon i must ask you to kindly read
this memorandum

  wondering what sort of crank stunt he
was up against tom took the paper and
read slowly like a man in a trance he
put the paper down on the desk and stared
at george then suddenly his eyes fell on
a letter lying on his desk he snatched it
up tore it open and read

dear tom

  the thing has happened as you probably know
by now the man plummer has arrived and
weve got to go through with it-you know arch-
man so this is merely to confirm by order of
john j archman george plummer is to have
charge of the mammoth for a month you will
continue as manager but you are to put in force
recommendations or suggestions that he makes
i feel for you tom may heaven protect you

bender

  tom marshall reached for a cigarette lit
it and sank weakly into his desk-chair his
fine handsome face was a study it was
hard to say whether he wanted to swear or
laugh or do both in a moment how-
ever his expression cleared he stood up
and offered george his hand

   well mr plummer he said  this is
rather a surprise i dont suppose that you
will want to-to start anything to-night

   no replied george with evident re-
luctance  but if you will be kind enough
to order a desk put in here for me first thing
in the morning we can have a conference
then good night mr marshall and
george strode from the office briskly-with
a step of dignified authority and a smile to
assure mr marshall that all would be well
in denmark

  and sure enough early the next morning
the plummer regime went into effect in the
hotel mammoth as the morning hours
wore on the news penetrated to all parts
of the hotel that the mussy little pest the
awful hick from hickville was some kind
of special investigator and supervisor ex-
traordinary-even tom marshall had to
take orders from him

  in the  conference  george outlined his
ideas and gave marshall some instructions
tom said nothing he was very pale but
his pulse was good and he was able to sit
up and smoke a cigarette then george
summoned various employees of the hotel
his first interview was with armand the
chef

  the result was startling armand in-
dignant at the summons walked straight
from the kitchen wearing his white cap
and twirling his mustache he listened to
george for a while then suddenly armand
flung up his arms wildly and laid down a
terrible barrage of vivid french and his
own english

   jamb on jamb on haash i shall not
non it is insult-madness himself my
temperament is bust-i go pig that you
are 

  and thats just what armand did-he
went at once waving his arms and talking
to himself he rushed from the office down
through the amazed lobby and clad as he
was jumped into a taxi and ordered the
astonished driver who knew him to take
him to his apartment at once-where he
announced his intention of staying until
such time as the mammoth came to its
senses

  george appointed a deputy chef and con-
tinued his interviewing the chief clerk
out of his head



received the shock of his life and went out
reeling and jibbering all single rooms
were to be at a uniform price of three dol-
lars all suites four and no rooms whatever
reserved in advance

  the maitre dhotel got his no tables in
the dining-room to be reserved first come
first served it happened that the hat-
checking privilege had expired and was up
for renewal george abolished the insti-
tution

  the housekeeper- but about that time
tom marshall grabbed his hat and went to
the races

  george spent the rest of the day going
about giving personal instructions to bell-
hops chambermaids taxi-starters waiters
and the girl at the cigar-counter somehow
the hotel mammoth survived that day and
night

  the next morning it found its new bosss
ideas crystallized in a large electric sign over
the desk

  it flashed this to the world

  this is your hotel just sign the book 
  and let us take care of you no rooms
  or tables reserved in advance uniform
  reasonable rate for everything

welcome

  added to this the clerks received a bun-
dle of printed cards which they were to
hand each person who registered and dis-
tribute to those already in the hotel the
cards read

dear guest

  if you are not comfortable if you are not
  receiving proper service apply to me per-
  sonally

george plummer boniface

  before the luncheon hour men appeared
with movable hatracks which they placed
beside the center-tables in the dining-room
they screwed small racks over the side ta-
bles along the walls then instead of the
usual elaborate mammoth menu small
cards announcing  simple wholesome dish-
es were placed on each table

  having accomplished all the above and
put in force numerous other innovations
yet to bear fruit george placed his hands
in the pockets of his free-and-easy suit and

     	a-s

strolled with an air of authority and pos-
sessiveness up and down the lobby occa-
sionally rumpling his mop of tow hair his
blue-green orbs roving about to spot slack-
ers to the new regime

  the luncheon crowd never being very
large at the mammoth there was only
desultory trouble during the afternoon buls
as the dinner hour approached the mam-
moth began to exhibit all the signs of
earthquakes revolutions and declarations
of war people who had wired innocently
for rooms were arriving in shoals they
gnashed their teeth and swore some took
the rooms offered them others promptly
shook the mammoth dust from their feet

  one gentleman from the west however
demanded an explanation  whats come
over this outfit he roared  you got
my wire didnt you

  politely the clerk pointed to the electric
sign at the same time handing the irate
one a card

   what the hell do i care for your fool
signs the gentleman yelled and what
are you giving me this for-here show
me this boniface guy

  george stepped forward  the clerk is
correct sir he said  we are under a
new management we do not reserve
rooms but i can show you the best in the
house-

  the gentleman exploded again  so
youre this plummer guy eh plummer
it ought to be spelled with a b say ive
been stopping here for years-before you
or any one like you was born but im
through-im damned if i stay in any ho-
tel run by a plumber boy take my bag
out to the cab and shaking his fist in
georges face the gentleman went

  about this time guests began telephon-
ing for the boniface a nervous lady from
vermont on the ninth floor said she
smelled smoke and would mr plummer in-
vestigate at once george promised to do
so a pair of sports on the sixth floor
wanted to know if mr plummer would
like to join them in a little stud game in
their room george thanked them but
said he was too busy just then there
were half a dozen other calls for mr plum-
mer three of which necessitated his taking


all-story weekly

the elevator and answering in person by
the time he stepped into the lobby again
there was a slight perspiration on georges
brow but hastily he wiped it off and re-
sumed his boniface smile

  he walked toward the dining-room
where the red-plush cord was no more
there was quite a mussy scrimmage going
on at the entrance patrons who had tried
to reserve tables were milling back and
forth fighting each other and swearing at
the helpless captain who was doing the
best he could considering the obvious fact
that he could do nothing

   at the sight the perspiration came out
on georges brow again but again he wiped
it off pie seemed about to say something
but instead he trotted around the edge of
the mob and slid himself into the dining-
room it was pretty well filled but
strange to say a lot of people seemed to
be going out hastily after a glance at the
new menu card and words with the waiters
wearing his boniface smile george strolled

	up to a young man and girl in evening
dress at a side table  i trust you are
quite comfortable sir he said

  the young man looked up in amaze-
ment  and who are you he asked

   george proffered one of his cards the
girl giggled before the young man could
speak a waiter hurried up to george
 the gentleman at my table wants to see
you at once mr plummer he said

   giving the young couple a parting smile
george turned and followed the waiter to a
center table where a large man was seated
with three elaborately gowned women
the large man was excitedly waving the
menu look here he exclaimed to
george  where is your regular card-do
you mean to tell me that all we can get is
this camp junk and why cant these
ladies check their wraps-whats the mean-
ing of this clothes-line here

  george bowed and smiled  we are
now serving plain wholesome-

    well ill be damned roared the large
man  i didnt believe it-the mammoth
turned into a lunch-counter come on-
lets get out and out they went while
george stood there a puzzled slightly wor-
ried look on his face

  at that precise moment and unknown
to george a reporter was in a mammoth
telephone booth speaking rapidly to a city
editor down on park row the city edi-
tor clutched the phone a gleam in his eye
 great stuff he yelled  go to it-two
columns front page get his picture-
well run it with archmans get it
other reporters were doing the same and
other city editors were yelling  great
stuff

  thus it happened that when george
again wearing his boniface smile strolled
back to the lobby immediately he was sur-
rounded by half a dozen eager young men
with pads and pencils  we want your
story for the papers mr plummer said
their spokesman  tell us about yourself
and your remarkable plans for the mam-
moth 

  george smiled he swelled and rumpled
his hair he smiled as would napoleon or
csesar he had arrived carefully and
with easy modesty he told them about him-
self and answered their questions while
the pencils of the serious-faced young men
flew then they photographed him

  a dozen or so calls for mr plummer
had accumulated while the interview was
going on but now george did not feel equal
to answering them he felt a little ex-
hausted leaving instructions to say that
he was busy he went up to the office he
had a great desire to see tom marshall
but tom had not returned in fact he
had telephoned in to say that he had been
called out of town for a few days

  toms secretary dumped a mountain of
miscellaneous papers in front of george
he looked at them a few minutes and
again the perspiration stood out on his
brow  please take care of these he
said getting to his feet  i-im going
to get a bite to eat he went down to
the grill consumed a pair of chops and
some coffee-and then george went right
up to his room and to bed

  however he was up very early the
first thing george did was to get all the
newspapers yes there was his picture
together with that of john j archman
but as he read the stories he frowned it
seemed to him that they were just a bit too
out of his head



flippant-but the papers he reflected were
always taking liberties with prominent
people

  that was a red-letter day in the history
of the hotel mammoth a riot in a mad-
house might describe it having read the
morning papers it looked as if all new
york had managed to take an hour off to
come in and see for itself personally
george was kept rushing all over the hotel
it seemed to him that the whole world
was doing nothing but call for mr plum-
mer mr plummer mr plummer he
was the busiest boniface on record by
noon he ceased to wipe his brow-he just
let the perspiration trickle down into his
eyes-eyes that were beginning to have a
wild glare in them

  at two oclock he went up-stairs for a
nap it was after eight when he awoke
he felt better now and phoned down to
ask if everything was all right

  sure answered toms secretary
 going fine but i hope you will come
down at once mr plummer-we need
you

  george shaved himself straightened his
string tie and went down immediately
he was summoned to the desk a delega-
tion of fifty business men from the south
who had wired for rooms were telling the
world what they thought of things when
they found out who george was they fell
on him en masse they passed him around
among themselves when that was over
and george was gasping for breath the
telephone calls for the boniface began
again only now the whole hotel seemed
calling him at once much as if the thing
had been planned wildly george rushed
up and down and around

  then on one of his flying trips through
the lobby a bellhop carrying a large pitcher
suddenly stepped out and confronted
george  mr plummer said the boy
 colonel daingerfield up in  wants
his iced tea

   well said george mopping his brow
 why dont you take it to him

   i thought you knew about it sir the
boy replied  you see the colonel is our
oldest guest as a special favor mr mar-
shall always takes the colonels iced tea up

himself and as mr marshall aint here
maybe youd better do it sir and seiz-
ing the psychological moment suddenly
the youth thrust the pitcher into georges
hands

  george stood there clutching the pitcher
 i see he said a little thickly  of
course-ill take it myself holding the
thing tight george entered an elevator and
was whizzed up to the tenth floor

  he knocked at the door of no 
receiving no answer he knocked again
there was the sound of some one getting
out of bed and swearing then the door
flew open and a tall gray-haired man with
a ferocious mustache and clad in pajamas
stood there glaring what the devil
he exclaimed yes the colonel was from
kentucky sir

  george smiled his boniface smile  ive
brought your iced tea colonel he said
genially

   youve brought what demanded the
colonel actually turning pale  look
here young man are you trying to get
funny with me what the devil do you
mean

   in the absence of mr marshall said
george  i brought this-

  suddenly the colonel snatched the pitcher
and held it up to his nose  by the old
harry he yelled  it is tea well see
how you like it and instantly the colo-
nel raised the pitcher poured the contents
over georges head and flung the pitcher
itself into the hall then the colonel
slammed the door and went back to bed

  in stepping back george tripped and
fell sprawling the tenth-floor telephone
girl came to his rescue  oh mr plum-
mer she said as she helped him up
 youre wanted down-stairs at once

  george swayed a moment wiping the
tea from his face the wild glare in his
eyes was now very pronounced he tot-
tered into an elevator reaching the
lobby he found himself in the midst of a
howling mob crowds were surging
around demanding that some one point out
to them mr george plummer

  the house detective hurried up to
george  mr plummer he said  this
crowd is beyond our control - ive just


all-story weekly

phoned for the police reserves you better
go up-stairs or well never get this bunch
out

  george tottered back into the elevator
 up-up to-to my room he stuttered
reaching the top floor he swayed and tot-
tered to his room and flung himself on his
back on the bed queer noises came from
georges throat and there was that wild
glare in his eyes

  it chanced that the housekeeper a
motherly soul was on the top floor at the
moment she saw george enter his room
she hurried to the door and looked in
 the poor man she murmured she sat
on the side of the bed and put a hand on
georges fevered brow  its been too
much for you mr plummer she said
 just lie here and take a rest

  somehow the touch of that motherly
hand brought george a sudden vision he
saw the peaceful old desk of the towaco
house he saw his old suspender-clad boss
genially dozing in the little back office
towaco-peace and quiet

  and suddenly to the astonishment of
the housekeeper george jumped from the
bed with feverish haste he flung his be-
longings into the shiny suit-case and
snapped it shut

  why mr plummer the housekeeper
exclaimed  what-

  im going away from here george
yelled now-forever

  grabbing up the suit-case he rushed
from the room and flung himself into an
elevator as he sprang into the lobby the
police were busy clearing out the mob and
there was the dang of fire engines outside
for in the general excitement some one had
called out the fire department

  but george heeded not like a man
with one overpowering purpose in life he
plunged through the battle hatless clutch-
ing the shiny suit-case out on the street
he jumped into a taxi  hudson tube-
quick he yelled meanwhile tom mar-
shalls secretary was telephoning the yale
club its all right tom he said
 george has beat it

  george rushed into the erie station only
to find that it was too late for a train to
towaco trainmen looked him over in

wonderment-george was the wildest speci-
men ever seen in the station  whats
the matter kid one of them asked
 somebody dead say the western flier
is just leaving-she stops at junction city
an you can get a local from there in the
morning

  george grabbed a ticket for the flier
the train was actually moving when they
let him through the gate he dropped the
shiny suit-case on the platform and hurled
himself aboard the suit-case bumped and
fell under the flying wheels-and was no
more

  he sat bolt upright in the smoker he
seemed to be urging the flier to still greater
speed

    clean bugs said the conductor to him-
self as he took georges ticket

  george did not sleep and when he got
off at junction city he sat glassy-eyed on
a bench for two hours waiting for the to-
waco local

  it was nine oclock in the morning when
a disheveled glassy-eyed tow-headed and
hatless figure presented itself in the quiet
lobby of the towaco house the boss
gave a startled look then he came forward
chuckling and shook georges hand
well well he exclaimed if it aint
george plummer why youre the most
famous man in towaco george we read
all about it in the papers just dropped
in to look us over eh

   i-i would like my job back mr
thompson said george his eyes roving
to the comfortable chair behind the little
desk

  the boss chuckled  surest thing you
know george he said your job is
right here waiting for you-but i think
youd better get something to eat and go
right to bed just now george myrtle
wild has been sorter helpin me out while
you-while you were showin em a few in
new york

  just then myrtle herself-with it done
in the very newest style-appeared from
the back office  why george you poor
dear she exclaimed you come right
into the dining-room and ill rustle you
something to eat at once

  and meekly totteringly george obeyed

preceding chapters briefly retold

norman storm moving in good society and holding a position in a large trust company
but almost at the end of his financial resources saw his wife leila in the business section
of the city one afternoon but she did not see him yet at dinner that night in their sub-
urban home in greenlea with storms closest friend george holworthy she told them that she
had not been in town  for ages later storm heard her talking over the telephone to soipe
one she called  dear and later she went out the next day a chance remark made storm think
that his wife was involved in an affair with dick brewster a neighbor who was estranged from his
wife and when he returned home that night earlier than he was expected and found brewster
kissing leilas hand and thanking her for  the happiest hour of his life he was sure of her guilt
as a matter of fact brewster was thanking leila for her efforts in bringing his wife and him
together again

    neither leila nor brewster knew that storm was in the house and after brewster had left
storm went into the den where leila was sitting and accused her of unfaithfulness there was a
stormy scene during which storm struck leila with a golf club the blow killed her

    he felt no grief nor remorse-she had deceived him storm destroyed every evidence of the
crime arranged the body as if she had fallen and struck her head against the fender in front of
the fireplace and went to his room next morning the body was found by a servant and storm
called acting the part of a grief-stricken husband storm sent for dr carr who in turn sent
for the county medical authorities storm also sent for holworthy who arrived in deep sorrow
at the death of leila

     after an examination that brought out the fact that lelia had been subject to fainting spells
the authorities decided -that she had died by accident no suspicion had attached to storm-he
had won

the letter

despite his sense of victory the day
was a long-drawn-out period of tor-
ture for storm

  upon the departure of dr carr and the
officials george holworthy had to be told
in detail the story of the nights tragic
event and its reiteration drew heavily upon
the store of self-control which was left to
his companion after the ordeal through
which he had passed but storm narrated it
carefully with a critical consciousness of
every effect

   i dont know what is the matter with
me he cried dramatically in conclusion
 i cant break down i cant seem to feel
george i saw her as she lay there i tell
myself that this ghastly unbelievable thing
is true and yet it has no meaning for me
i catch myself listening for her step wait-
ing to hear her voice am i going mad
 its the shock george said quietly
 the stark horror of the thing has stunned
you norman you cant feel it yet you
are numb i suppose

  he looked curiously shrunken and with-
ered and years older as he sat hunched there
in his chair his faded red-rimmed eyes

patience almost of repugnance as he re-
garded him his evident sorrow was a
subtle reproach before which the other
writhed could he endure his presence in
the days which must decently elapse before
the funeral george would be useful how-
ever in the interim and when it was all
over he could shut himself away from
every one

   thats why i sent for you he ob-
served  i cant seem to get a grip on
things and i thought you would take charge
for me and keep off the mob of sympa-
thizers-

    i will ill attend to everything old
man theres bound to be a certain amount
of publicity you know but ill see the re-
porters myself and fend off the neighbors
carr will send in the undertaker and ill
phone foulkes is there any one else you
want me to notify

   george did indeed prove invaluable for
millard had spread the tidings and soon the
house was besieged by horror-stricken
friends of the dead woman they came
from all walks of life from the humblest
country-folk about to the most arrogant
of the aristocratic colony in mute testimony
to the breadth of her kindliness and the
affection she had inspired from earliest
afternoon too reporters began filtering in
on every train but george held them off
with surprising tact and diplomacy and by
nightfall a semblance of peace had fallen
upon the bereft household

   the den was restored to its normal state
the door locked and in the dainty drawing-
room across the hall from the library leila
lay as if asleep her golden hair falling low
to hide the cruel wound and all about her
the early spring flowers she had loved

  now- that they were alone together
georges presence proved insufferable and
storm professing complete nervous exhaus-
tion suggested that they retire early

   george worn out with his own emotions
and the strain of the day acquiesced in evi-
dent relief he had dreaded a night-long
vigil with his bereaved friend and rejoiced
that the strange seemingly dazed apathy
which had held him in its grip was giving
way to the demands of overtaxed nature

  sleep however was furthest from storms
intentions there was work still to be done
and in secret foulkes had rnified his
intention of coming out on the first train in
the morning and it was possible that he
might suggest going over leilas papers if
that letter which she had tried to conceal
the day before were found or any other
correspondence from brewster it might pre-
cipitate the rise of a suspicion which other-
wise seemed now to be eliminated

  leilas desk was down in the library and
waiting only until he felt assured that the
occupant of the guest chamber across the
hall had fallen asleep storm put on soft
felt slippers drew his dressing gown about
him and descended

  how still the house was still yet vi-
brant with something unseen but palpitat-
ing as though the spirit had not wholly de-
parted from that immobile form lying amid
the blossoms whose fragrance stole out with
cloying sinister sweetness upon the air

  storm closed the library door noiselessly
behind him switched on the light and
crossing to the little desk stood transfixed

  a book lay upon it and from between its
leaves protruded as if carelessly or hastily
thrust there what appeared to be the very
letter he sought  leicester building
the engraved letters stood out as he drew
the envelope forth but above them was a
line which made him start

   national tool and implement com-
pany

  but brewster was an insurance broker
the name had an oddly familiar ring too
what could it mean

  with shaking fingers he drew the en-
closure from the envelope and read

mrs norman storm

  dear madam i have reconsidered my decision
of this morning and am willing to sell to you
the strip of land adjoining your property at the
price you named on condition that the deal be
consummated with you personally i will enter
into no negotiations with your husband if you
will call at my office to-morrow the ninth inst
with your check i will have the deed and bill of
sale ready

your obedient servant

alphetjs jaffray

  storm crushed the letter in his hands
the trout-stream leila had bearded their
ashes to ashes



irascible neighbor in his town office and in-
duced him to sell her the property which he
himself had been unable to force or cajole
the old scoundrel to relinquish

  but why had she been so secretive about
it why had she lied about her presence
in town sought to conceal the letter striven
to make a mystery where no cause for one
existed

  the queries which hammered at his brain
were swiftly swept aside by the one domi-
nating fact her visit had not concerned
brewster her lie had concealed no act of
guilt or even indiscretion what if- great
god if he had made a hideous mistake

  but no he had seen them together she
and her lover in that very room not twenty-
four hours before had heard brewsters
impassioned words witnessed his act of de-
votion whatever motive had prompted
her secret purchase of the trout-stream it
was beside the point at issue there must
be proof in her desk proof to augment and
support the evidence of his own eyes

  he tore the drawers open one after an-
other scattering the neat piles of correspon-
dence social notes cards of invitation re-
ceipted bills memoranda and household ac-
counts-his feverish fingers sought in vain
among them for a single line of an intimate
or sentimental nature but then leila
would scarcely have kept secret love letters
in an open desk somewhere in her apart-
ments up-stairs perhaps she had arranged
a hiding place for them

  then a swift rememberance came to him
the secret compartment back of the
small drawer between the pigeonholes on
the desk top was a small space to which ac-
cess could be had only by pressing a hidden
knob leila had found it by accident one
day and been almost childishly delighted
with her discovery	

  storm removed the drawer pressed the
spring and the false back slid aside re-
vealing two packets of letters one was
bound by a bit of white satin ribbon yel-
lowing now and slightly frayed the other
encircled merely with a rubber band

  the sight of them brought a grimace of
triumph to storms lips but it changed
quickly a  he tore the ribbon from the first
packet the letters were all postmarked

prior to ten years ago and were in his hand-
writing-his own love letters written duriag
the period of their engagement and before
one end of the ribbon was knotted about
a dried-flower an orange blossom it
must have been from her wedding bouquet

   a strange tightness constricted his throat
and he thrust the packet hastily aside he
did not want to be reminded at this hour
of the happiness the fools paradise in
which he had lived before enlightenment
came no sentimentality must be permitted
to weaken his self-control now

  but the second packet too contained
only his letters those written since their
marriage mere notes of a most prosaic sort
some of them sent to her during his infre-
quent absences from home and reminding
her of trivial every-day matters which re-
quired attention the last dated only a
month before concerned the reinstatement
of macwhirter their antebellum gardener
why had leila kept every scrap of his
handwriting as though she treasured it as
though it were precious to her

  for a long time he sat there staring at
the scattered envelopes the first vague ter-
rible stirring of doubt which had come when
he read jaffrays letter returning again to
torture his spirit then once more the
scene of the previous night in that room
arose in reassuring condemnation and with
a smothered oath he seized the letters and
tore them viciously the older packet with
the rest until nothing remained but a heap
of infinitesimal scraps and the bit of yel-
lowed ribbon

  he wanted them out of his sight de-
stroyed utterly but where- the fire in
the kitchen range would have been banked
for the night but he could rake the coals
aside sweeping the torn letters into a
newspaper together with the ribbon he made
his way quietly to the kitchen

  the range balked him at first and he
strove vainly to coax a blaze from the livid
coals but with the aid of kindling wood and
after much manipulation of the dampers
he succeeded in producing a tiny wavering
fork of flame upon this he thrust hand-
fuls of the paper scraps and when they
caught and blazed up he thrust the ribbon
deep among them


all-story weekly

  how slowly they burned the edges of
the ribbon charred and it curled up writh-
ing like a living thing in agony the flame
was dying down and storm had turned
frantically to the wood-box to pile on more
fuel when suddenly there came a grayish
puff a leaping tongue of fire and the ribbon
vanished leaving only a heap of pale flakes
against the darker coarser ashes

  storm scattered them and was placing an
extra stick of wood upon the glowing coals
to make sure that the evidences of his work
would be wholly obliterated when the ut-
terance of his name in surprised accents
made him wheel as though a blow had been
dealt to him from behind

chapter xiv

his birthday

x i orman i thought you were in
i bed george his short obese fig-
ure grotesque in an ugly striped
bathrobe stood blinking in the doorway
 what on earth are you doing down here
and whats burning theres a funny
odor-

   wretched green wood no wonder the
cook grumbles about this range i thought
i should never get it going storm inter-
rupted hastily  i couldnt sleep and
wanted a cup of coffee there was no use
in disturbing the servants

 why didnt you call me demanded
the other  i could have made it for you
you look all done up norman did you
take that sleeping stuff carr left for you
storm shook his head

   it would take more than that to bring
sleep to me to-night he said

   well anyway i dont know what you
are poking about in here for objected
george  youre a chump to try t get
the range going at this hour when youve
got that electric percolator in the dining-
room heres the coffee come on in there
and ill have it ready for you in no time
storm followed him in silence only too
glad to get him away from the kitchen and
watched him as in deft bachelor-fashion he
manipulated the percolator

storm drank the coffee when it was made

and then dragged george off to the library
where the latter at length fell asleep upon
the couch but storm sat huddled in his
chair dry-eyed and brooding until the
dawn

  wendle foulkes appeared at nine oclock
his keen old face very solemn and almost
his first words when his condolences were
made set at rest a question which daly
had raised on the previous day

   you know of course that leila left
no will he began  at least none to my
knowledge and i am certain she would
have consulted me had she entertained any
thought of making one death was far-
thest from her imagining poor child what
she left is yours of course but we will have
to comply with the law and advertise for
heirs

  storm made a gesture of wearied impa-
tience and the attorney went on

   there is something i must tell you
norman  you were not my first visitor
on monday morning leila had been be-
fore you she left only a few minutes before
your arrival but she had requested me to
say nothing to you of her coming

   but why storm stared

   she came to consult me about a piece
of property which she wanted to buy that
strip of land next your place here over
which you and alpheus jaffray have hag-
gled and fought for years she had got in
the old mans good graces somehow and
she believed that she could persuade him
to sell it to her even though he was so
violently antagonistic to you i dont mind
telling you frankly that i advised against
it norman it would have taken all that
she had left of her original capital and i
knew how yours was dwindling but she
won me over

  he paused and wiped his eyeglasses
clearing his throat suspiciously meanwhile
 she ordered me to keep the proposed
transaction a secret from you and i prom-
ised but now it is only right that you should
know she left to go to jaffrays office
over in the leicester building

george holworthy who was hovering in
the background drew in his breath sharply
but storm repeated with dogged insistence
 why should my wife have wanted to
ashes to ashes



keep such a secret from me i cannot un-
derstand it she told me everything-
he paused involuntarily biting his lip
there was one other thing she had not told
him one that she had not confessed even at
the last

   you would not have been kept in igno-
rance long the attorneys tone was pity-
ing  have you forgotten what day to-
morrow is

  to-morrow storm repeated blankly

   your birthday

  god the exclamation came from
george   and the funeral 

  storm sat as if turned to stone it had
been for him her secret trip to town her
innocent pitiful subterfuges her joy over
the letter which had told her that the sur-
prise she had planned was within her grasp
all for him

  then a swift revulsion of feelirfg came
bah it may have been to throw more dust
in his eyes to render his confidence in her
doubly assured a sop to her own consci-
ence perhaps the infinite reproach in her
eyes when he had accused her there in the
den her air of conscious righteousness when
she had said  you will regret that ac-
cusation bitterly when you learn the
truth what a consummate actress she
had become

  fate had played into his hands though
he had witnessed her perfidy with his own
eyes had it not been for his opportune
return that night how easily his suspicions
would have been allayed how contrite
he would have been at his doubt of her and
how she and her lover would have gloated
over the ease with which he had been de-
ceived

  but the others were looking at him
amazed at his silence and with an effort
he pulled himself together

  her last thought was for me his
voice shook with the irony of it but to the
two men it was an evidence of purely na-
tural emotion the thought of it only
makes what has come harder for me to
bear her unselfishness her devotion-

   i know boy i know foulkes laid
his hand for a moment on storms shoulder
 you must try to remember that you have
been far luckier than most men you have

had ten years of such perfect happiness as
falls to the lot of few of us

   that is true storm bowed his head
to conceal the sneer of bitterness which rose
unbidden to his lips  i cannot realize that
it has come so suddenly so horribly to an
end

  a brief discussion of business affairs en-
sued and then wendle foulkes took his de-
parture a silence had fallen between the
other two which was broken at last by
george

   so that was it he murmured as if to
himself  that was why she invented that
luncheon at the ferndale inn-

   what demanded storm aghast how
much did george know  invented what
luncheon

   dont you remember when i dined here
with you-god was it only last monday
night-and leila told us she had lunched
that day at the ferndale inn when in re-
ality she had been to the city i repeated
the remark because i could scarcely believe
my ears but she stuck to her little fib i
did wonder at your surprise for i had seen
you both in town at noon

   you had-seen us both storm re-
peated

   yes i was going through cortlandt
street when just across the way i saw leila
coming out of the leicester building and
you standing there staring after her as
though you had seen a ghost george ex-
plained innocently  i started to hail you
and tried to cross but a line of traffic got
in the way and when the street was clear
you had disappeared i meant to tell you
that night but i didnt

   why thats so it must have been
leila after all whom i saw storm
weighed each word carefully  i wasnt
sure you know she passed me so quickly
and when she spoke that night of having
been to the ferndale inn i naturally con-
cluded that i must have been mistaken it
couldnt have been she whom i saw it did
not occur to me for a moment that she was
telling even a little white lie for leila has
never kept anything from me in all her life
george

  he spoke with deliberate emphasis triv-
ing desperately to eradicate from the others


all-story weekly

mind the thought that he had been aware
of her deception confound the fellow
why had he out of all in the city been the
one to witness that unexpected meeting
his silence later was significant too had
he an inkling of storms state of mind that
night

   i see couldnt imagine why she should
have kept her little expedition to herself
but it wasnt any affair of mine of course
george spoke with an elaborate carelessness
which did not seem wholly convincing to
the critical ears of the other man  funny
it should have deceived you for she didnt
take me in for a minute she fibbed so-so
clumsily bless her

   i thought it probably some little joke
she was planning but your approaching
birthday never occurred to me it is odd
isnt it that we should have talked of old
jaffray and that trout-stream when you
walked to the station with me later

   leila knew how i had set my heart
upon it storm returned it would do no
good to revert to the topic of the lie re-
iterated explanation of his attitude would
only deepen any suspicion which george
might still entertain to ignore it to pass
it by as a thing of no moment was the
only course  do you remember that she
complained of feeling ill that night

  george nodded

   that was the first thing i thought of
when millard broke the news to me after
i could begin to think at all he observed-
 she must have had a warning that one of
those attacks was coming on i spoke of
it to her as you may recall but she denied
it afraid of worrying you i suppose to
think that it should have come the very
next night when she was alone and help-
less 

  storm drew a deep breath at least
george had no shadow of a suspicion as to
the real cause of her death

  dont talk about it he implored
 ive reproached myself a hundred times
with not being at hand but how could i
know

   forgive me you couldnt of course
no one could have anticipated it it was
to be thats all one can say though god
only knows why you were not to blame

  he threw his arm across the others
shoulders in an affectionate consoling clasp
and in his mild candid eyes storm read
only pity sorrow and an abiding trustful-
ness

chapter xv

the brewsters call

 i am the resurrection and the life-
the white-frocked ministers voice
rose solemnly above the subdued
rustfings and sighing whispers in the little
vine-wreathed church and the stirring
ceased a robin peered in at one of the
open windows from his perch on a maple
bough and chirped inquiringly and the
scent of lilacs was wafted in from the rec-
tors garden to mingle with the heavier
fragrance of lilies and white roses heaped
about the casket at the altar steps

  it was such a small casket almost like
that of a child and fairly buried beneath
the weight of the floral offerings which
banked it a varied collection of offerings
for the costliest of hothouse set pieces min-
gled with sheaves of home-grown blossoms
and rare orchids nestled beside humble wild
violets but each had their place

  the congregation too was a hetero-
geneous one rich and poor smart and
shabby the country club colony and the
villagers met in a common democracy to
do honor to their dead friend

   the lord gave and the lord has taken
away- the minister went on to the end
and then the voices of a hidden choir
chanted softly	

   lord thou hast been our refuge from one
generation to another

  in the front pew norman storm rested
his sleek head upon his black-gloved hand
and george holworthy beside him cleared
his throat huskily in the moment of still-
ness which followed the psalm a womans
sob rose from somewhere back in the
church the sound jangling in storms ears
like a tpuch upon naked nerves

  the last act of the farce and then peace
peace in which to plan for the future to
gain strength with which to shut out vain
ashes to ashes

-

maddening memories to meet and cope with
the change which his own act had wrought
in his life but would peace come

  everything had gone smoothly his
scheme to evade justice and preserve him-
self from danger had been crowned with
success but in fortifying himself against
suspicion and accusation from outside he
had not thought that a more subtle enemy
might arise to be faced and vanquished or
forever hold him in miserable thrall

  his love for leila had not died with her
despite her unfaithfulness to the thought
of which he clung doggedly he could not
exorcise her gentle influence everything
in the house spoke mutely to him of her
everywhere he turned were evidences of her
care and thoughtfulness and charm

  in vain he reminded himself that it was
over and done with a closed chapter never
to be recalled he was beginning to fear
himself to dread the hours of solitude ahead
as much as he looked forward to them
the voice of his conscience was whispering
threatening and he must silence it or know
no peace

  george glanced furtively at him now and
then as the service went on but he gave no
sign it drew to a close at last and still he
sat there immersed in his own thoughts
until a touch upon his arm roused him to a
consciousness of the present

  half-way down the aisle richard and
julie brewster with exalted faces and hands
clasped like children stood aside to let him
pass but he did not even see them and
those who pressed forward and would have
spoken paused at sight of his face pitying
shocked murmurs followed him as he and
george stepped into the car but he did not
heed them and the long ride to the cemetery
progressed in silence

  the brief simple service of committal
the clods of earth falling dully heavily into
the grave and then came the interminable
drive home georges glances were less fur-
tive now more openly charged with amaze-
ment

  storm had not shed a tear had not
vouchsafed an utterance of emotion
throughout those solemn hours his friend
wondered how great the reaction would be
from such long-pent-up grief and as they

swept into the driveway before the silent
empty house which awaited them he ven-
tured a suggestion

   norman dont you want to pack up
and come and stay in town with me for a
few days the change will do you good
and give you time to - to get used to
things

  storm stifled the exasperated rejoinder
which rose to his lips and replied quietly

   thanks old man but i want to be here
alone ive got to face facts sooner or
later to bring myself to a realization that
she has gone and im better off here

   well maybe thats so george con-
ceded  country airs the best and ill
run out now and then to cheer you up
youll take to playing golf again after a
bit-

 dont the cry was wrung from
storms very soul never again would he
hold a golf-stick in his hands he could
see now before him that driver with the
dark stains spattered upon it and he re-
coiled shuddering from the apparition
while george inwardly cursed his own tact-
lessness the while wholly ignorant of how
his clumsy well-meant effort at consolation
had pierced the armor of the other mans
self-control

  the fickle may sunshine vanished and
before the coming of twilight a bank of
heavy gray clouds formed in the west pre-
saging a storm they made a pretense of
dining while the rising wind swept gustily
about the house and moaned in the chim-
neys like a thing in pain

  storm still preserved his stoic calm and
georges perturbation grew it wasnt na-
tural wasnt like the norman he had known
from college days the younger man had
always been outwardly reserved but such
stern almost deliberate self-repression was
new to him and filled his friend with vague
alarm

   you didnt close your eyes during the
night before last and you couldnt have
slept much last night norman for i heard
you walking the floor at all hours he re-
marked  dont you think it would be
well to call in carr and have him look you
over and give you something quieting
youll be ill if you keep this up


all-story weekly

   im all right storm responded with a
touch of impatience  dont worry about
me george ill turn in early and by to-
morrow ill get a fresh grip on myself-
 i think youve got too tight a grip on
yourself as it is george interrupted

   what do you mean storm shot the
question at him almost fiercely was he
under surveillance his every mood and gesr
ture subject to analysis why couldnt the
other let him alone

   youre not meeting this normally re-
plied george in all seriousness  hang it
all id rather see you violent than like this
theres something horrible about your
calmness the way you are clamping down
your feelings if you would just give
way-

   i cant storm protested in the first
wholly honest speech which had passed his
lips  im all frozen up for gods sake
dont nag me george im about all in
the other subsided but storm could feel
his eyes upon him and their mute solicitude
drove him to an inward frenzy at all
costs he must get away from that insistent
scrutiny he would lock himself in his
room feign sleep iilness anything george
had served his turn and storm thanked for-
tune that business would of necessity de-
mand the fussy faithful little mans pres-
ence in town the next day
x he was casting about for an excuse as
they rose from the table when all at once
the front-door knocker sounded faintly al-
most apologetically

  i cant see any one i wont the
haggard lines deepened about storms
mouth  in heavens name cant they re-
spect my-my grief im going up-stairs
george you get rid of them send them
away whoever they are 

  but george did not send them away
listening from above storm heard the front
door open and close heard georges low
rumble and a reply in higher but softly
modulated feminine tones then came a
masculine voice which made him grip the
stair-rail in sudden fury not unmixed with
consternation

  richard brewster it couldnt be the
fellow would not dare intrude his presence
here even though he fancied his secret un-

shared by any living soul but that was
unmistakably julies voice raised in almost
tearful pleading and then brewster spoke
again

  what had brought them here why
didnt george get rid of them as he had
been told to do could it be that julie had
discovered the truth of her husbands un-
faithfulness and with a womans hysterical
notion of justice had brought brewster here
to force his confession to the man he had
wronged

  it was evident from the sound that
reached his ears that george was showing
them into the library was taking it upon
himself to disregard storms express com-
mands damn them all why couldnt
they let him alone a brief colloquy en-
sued and then george mounted the stairs

  look here he began in a sepulchral
whisper  its the brewsters norman
and i think you ought to see them for a
minute theres something they want to
tell you-

  i dont want to hear it interrupted
stqrm fiercely  good god man cant
you see im in no condition to listen to
a lot of vapid condolences i told you to
send them away

   i would have done so but i think you
ought to let them tell you george in-
sisted with the meek unyielding tenacity
which the other man had always found
exasperating  julie brewster is terribly
wrought up she says that in justice to
-to leilas memory you must hear what
she has to say

chapter xvi

the truth

in justice to leilas memory storm gave
a sudden involuntary start there
could be no ambiguity about that phrase
with a feeling as if the world were crash-
ing down about his ears he thrust george
unceremoniously aside and descended the
stairs

  they were standing side by side on the
hearthrug awaiting him julie in tears but
with her face bravely lifted to his brewster
meeting his eyes without a tremor
ashes to ashes



   it is good of you to see us mr storm
julie was making an obvious effort to con-
trol her emotion  we wouldnt have in-
truded but i wanted you to know the
truth i couldnt bear the thought that the
shadow of even the slightest misunderstand-
ing should rest between you and-and
leilas memory now especially when it
was all my fault

    your fault  storm repeated  sit
down please i dont understand-

   we wont detain you long old man
it was brewster who spoke but his words
failed to pierce the tumult in the others
brain  we felt it would comfort you as
much as anything could to know that al-
most her last thought on earth had been
for the happiness of others

  storms eyes had never left the womans
face and to their mute command she re-
sponded 

  im not going to try your patience with
a long story of my own foolishness but
i did a wicked selfish thing in dragging
poor leila into my troubles just to save
myself she was so generous so self-sac-
rificing that she did not murmur at the
risk to herself and i never realized until
she-she was dead that i might have been
the cause of a misunderstanding between
you at the very last it has almost killed
me to think of it and i simply had to
come and tell you the truth about the
whole affair

  storm tried to collect his reeling senses
but only one clear thought came to his
rescue these people must never know
never suspect that any trouble had arisen
between him and leila he steadied his
voice with an effort at composure

   i dont know what you mean mrs
brewster if my poor wife was able to
help you out of any difficulty-i am glad
but i know nothing of it you speak of a
risk-

   yes i have been very foolish-wil-
fully blindly foolish-in the way ive acted
for weeks past she paused and then
hurried on shamefacedly  you see i
thought dick was neglecting me and to
pay him out ive been flirting outrageously
with ted mattison leila tried to influence
me but i wouldnt listen to her and when



dick woke up to what was going on and
ordered me to not even speak to ted again
i-i resented it and defied him

   last monday i motored out to the
ferndale inn for lunch alone with ted
and some horrid gossipy people were there
who knew how id been trotting about i
didnt think they had caught a glimpse of
ted then but i was sure that if they had
recognized me they would put two and
two together and tell dick and i was
afraid terribly afraid for dick had
threatened to leave me if i disobeyed him

   as soon as i reached home that after-
noon i rushed to leila told her the whole
thing and made her promise to say that
she had been to the inn with me it
never occurred to me that that promise
would make her tell you a lie im afraid
i didnt think about anything except the
trouble i was in and how to get out of it

  so that was it they had come to ex-
plain about that paltry lie brewster
dared to stand there while his wife made
her trivial confession while all the time--
a turbulent flame of rage arose in storms
heart but he quelled it rigorously cau-
tion now brewster must not suspect

   i knew that my wife had not been with
you could that be his own voice speak-
ing with such quiet restraint  in fact
i had seen her myself in town at noon
although she did not know it please dont
distress yourself further mrs brewster i
knew what her errand was in town and
why she wished to keep it from me

   oh  julie stared for a moment and
then added miserably  leila was sure
that you guessed she had fibbed to you
the very next day-the last day of her
life-she begged me to absolve her from
her promise for she said you had seemed
so strange and cold to her that morning
she was afraid you suspected and it was
the first time she had ever told you an
untruth

   she must have imagined a change in
my attitude storm said hastily  i was
preoccupied and in a hurry to get to town
but that little white lie never gave me a
moments uneasiness i would have chaffed
her about it only i did not want to spoil
her surprise


all-story weekly

  surprise julie echoed

   yes when i had seen her in town
the day before she was just coming out of
alpheus jaffrays office in the leicester
building he felt a measure of grim sat-
isfaction at brewsters uncontrollable start
 she had been there to arrange to purchase
from him the trout-stream which adjoins the
property here and which he had refused to
sell me you know as well as all the rest
of the crowd what a veritable feud has
existed between the old fellow and me
i learned the truth from my attorney
whom leila had consulted previously about
the transaction my poor wife intended
it as a birthday surprise for me  my birth-
day is to-day-to-day 

  he turned away to hide the rage which
was fast getting beyond his control at the
smug hypocritical presence of that other
man but his emotion was misread by both
his companions

   to-day how terrible for you storm
began brewster but his wife sobbed

   if leila had only guessed but that
untruth made her positively wretched
why when i telephoned to her late that
night and she came out to meet me-

   you telephoned to her she met
you- the room whirled and grew black
before storms eyes and the womans voice
although clear and distinct seemed to
come from far away

   yes id had a terrible row with dick
when he came home that night and i knew
he had heard something more about ted
though i didnt -know what i was nearly
crazy mr storm and when he rushed out
of the house in anger i phoned leila and
begged her to meet me and help me tell
me what to do

   she had promised that afternoon to
come to me if i needed her you had
gone to the station with mr holworthy
when i called up and leila did meet me
at the edge of the golf course

   she urged me to tell dick everything
but i wouldnt i might just as well have
done so though for those horrid people
had seen ted with me at the inn after
all and they went straight to dick the
next day if only i hadnt persuaded leila
to lie for me it wasnt any use and it

made some of her last hours unhappy i
shall never forgive myself-never oh
dont look at me like that mr storm

i cant bear it

  storm had slowly risen from his chair
one hand clutching the table edge as though
for support his eyes fixed in an unwavering
gaze of horror at the one thing visible in
the whirling vortex about him the white
face of julie in his dazed brain a hideous
fact was taking shape and form and his
soul cowered before it

  he essayed to speak but no sound issued
from his dry lips and brewster stepped
forward

   try not to blame julie too much old
man he begged  you see the poor little
girl was desperate i was as much at fault
in the situation between us as she was your
dear wife showed me that and brought me
to reason the last act of her life was to
save me from wrecking both mine and
julies and we can never be grateful enough
to her memory that is why we had to
come here to-night to tell you

  slowly storms gaze shifted to the other
mans face and the inexorable truth of
brewsters sincerity was forced upon his
wretched consciousness still he could find
no words and the other continued

   when i confronted julie and she stuck
to her story i came here to your wife
to confirm the truth of what i had heard
she was loyal to julie she tried to make
me believe that she had accompanied her
to the inn but she was too inherently
honest to brave it out and i practically
tricked her into admitting the truth

   i was going to rush home then in my
jealous rage and break with julie forever
but your wife restrained me storm she
convinced me that julie hadnt done any-
thing really wrong anything that i could
not forgive and showed me where i too
had been at fault in neglecting her for my
business even though it was for her that i
wanted to succeed she made me see that
we could begin all over again on a firmer
basis even than before just when i thought
everything was ended and the future held
nothing but separation and despair

   i cant tell you what it meant to me
that quiet talk with your wife here in
ashes to ashes



this very room it was tuesday night you
know and death must have come to her
shortly after i cant realize it even now
she seemed so radiant so splendidly alive
ill never forget what she did for me and
if i thought that-that the excitement of
our interview- im afraid i made rather
a scene if it hurt her brought on that
stroke or fainting spell-

   no it was a form of catalepsy you
know a totally strange voice was speak-
ing in a monotonous dragging undertone
storm did not recognize it as his own
blind instinct alone braced him to a last
effort to dissemble  no one could pre-
dict when it was coming on or what caused
it no one to blame

  the lie died in his throat and all at
once he began to tremble violently as if
the chill of the grave itself were upon
him he caught at the table again his
whole body shaking collapsing and with
a harsh strangling cry the floodgates were
opened at last sinking to his knees he
buried his face in his arms lest the guilt
which consumed him be revealed and
sobbed out his anguish unrestrained

  he did not feel julies arms about him
her tears against his cheek nor know when
her husband led her gently away he
was face to face with the warped and
blackened thing which was his soul and
with that vision he descended to the nether-
most depths

chapter xvii

back in harness

when storm came to himself he was
lying on the library couch with the
gray dawn seeping in at the cur-
tained windows and georges rotund figure
in the hideous striped bathrobe looming up
grotesquely from an improvised bed formed
of two armchairs

  storm felt a vague sense of irritation
what was he doing there dressed save for
his shoes and collar instead of being in
pajamas in his own bed and why was
george hanging around

  then the mists of sleep cleared from his
brain and remembrance came

  leila was innocent and he had killed
her true to him in every act and word
and thought yet he had flung a monstrous
accusation at her and struck her down
his leila he saw her again as she lay
huddled at his feet and could have cried
aloud in his anguish

  if he could but take back that blow

if only it were given him to live over once
more the time which had passed since he
saw her on that crowded street and doubt
first entered his mind if he could only
speak to her tell her-

  then a measure of sanity returned to
him she was dead he had killed her
nothing could alter that nothing could
bring her back no reparation no expi-
ation would undo his mad act and restore
the life that he had taken

  if he himself were to live to go on
he must put behind him all thought of
the past crush back this creeping menace
of remorse which threatened to overwhelm
him regret would avail him nothing now
he had loved the woman who had shared
his life for ten years but she was gone and
the future was before him long years in
which since he could not atone he must
school himself to forget

  at least no one would ever suspect the
secret which he carried in his heart the
worst was over he had fooled them all
but with the thought a new terror gripped
him by the throat what had he done
what had he said when the revelation of
leilas innocence swept him from his moor-
ings of self-control

  the brewsters had been there both of
them staring at him as though the ghost
of leila herself had risen to accuse him
george must have been hovering about
somewhere too must have taken care of
him helped him to the couch watched
over him throughout those hours of uncon-
sciousness and listened great god had
he betrayed himself what might he not
have said

  the light was growing brighter now 
bringing out the familiar shapes of the
furniture against the gloom and revealing
in startling clarity the tired lines in the
relaxed face of his self-appointed nurse
storm sat up and scrutinized it half-fear-


all-story weekly

fully could george sleep like that ex-
hausted though he might well be if he had
gained an inkling of the truth

    it seemed impossible and yet storm felt
  that he must know the worst a direct
  accusation even would be better than this
  suspense the first look would tell the
  first glance that passed between them

    storm coughed and georges eyes opened
 sleepily wandered vaguely about and then
 as they came to bear on the upright figure
 on the couch warmed with a sudden clear
 light of affectionate compassion

    norman old boy how do you feel
 can i get you anything

    storm sank back with a sigh of relief

    no i-a drink of water- he
 mumbled and closed his eyes as george
 rose and padded off in his flapping slippers
 down the hall there still remained the
 brewsters and his sudden collapse in their
 presence was enough of itself to arouse their
 suspicion aside from the wild words which
 might have issued unbidden from his lips
 he must learn what had taken place

   when george returned with the glass
 storm drained it and then asked weakly
  went to pieces didnt i

    you sure did but it was coming to
 you george affirmed  youre all right
 now though so just rest and try not to
 think of anything carr fixed you up in
 good shape-

   oh lord groaned storm carr
 i didnt even know he was here how did
 you get rid of the brewsters

   well it wasnt easy a faint smile
 lighted georges tired face  dicks got
 sense enough but that little scatter-brained
 wife of his wanted to stay and take care
 of you it was all i could do to per-
 suade her to go home

    and all that while i was making an
 exhibition of myself before them storm
 exclaimed bitterly

     you were not retorted george  you
  broke down of course just as i knew you

	must sooner or later i hadnt been easy
 in my mind about you all day and i didnt
 like the look on your face when you went
 down to the library to see them so i stuck
 around not eavesdropping old boy but to
 be at hand in case you needed me i could

hear your voices and then you gave a kind
of a cry and i butted in

   i found julie fussing over you and i
motioned to her husband to get her away
into the drawing-room he came back and
we put you on the couch and thats all
there is to it i told them to stop in at
carrs and send him here on their way
home

   what did i say i mean storm has-
tily amended  i dont remember anything
julie and dick came to tell me how leila
had brought them together again when they
were on the point of a separation you
remember when she told us that she had
been out to the ferndale inn with julie
that wasnt only to keep her visit to old
jaffrays office secret but because she had
promised julie to lie for her

   they thought i might have misunder-
stood and that it would comfort me to
know she had made peace between them
but instead it-it broke me up the full
realization came over me of all i had lost
and i went off my head i guess tell ie
what i said george

   why nothing you just-hang it all
man you gave way to your feelings thats
all you didnt say anything george
replied uncomfortably  when the doc-
tor came he gave you a good stiff hypo-
dermic and you dropped off to sleep like
a baby youre bound to feel rocky you
know but youre over the worst of it

   poor old george with renewed con-
fidence there came to storm a twinge of
compunction  you loo as though you
needed the doctor yourself you must
have had a rotten night

   never you mind about me returned
george gruffly  here carr said you
were to take this when you woke up and
not to talk too much

  obediently storm took the medicine and
almost immediately drifted off into troubled
sleep

  it was broad noon when he awakened
once more with the fragrant odor of coffee
in the air and george standing before him
dressed for departure

   sorry old boy but ive got to run up
to town you know youll be all right
for a few hours and ill be back before
ashes to ashes



night drink your coffee take a cold bath
and get out on the veranda in the sun
nobody  bother you ive seen to that

  storm tried faintly to protest against
georges return he didnt need any care
he would be better off alone and the
other mustnt neglect his business affairs
any longer but george was not to be
swerved from his purpose and after a few
hours of solitude storm was in a mood
to welcome his return in his weakened
state he did not find it easy to keep his
truant thoughts from straying to the past
and a horror which he was unable to
combat made him shun his own society

  for the next few days while the flood of
condolences still poured in he clung to
george as to an anchor but when the
last dismal conventions had been observed
and the household had settled down to
something like order his old feeling of irri-
tation against his friend returned georges
eternal pussy-footing about the house as
though death yet lingered there his lugubri-
ous face and labored attempts at cheer and
consolation became insupportable and his
host breathed a sigh of relief when he ulti-
mately departed

  spring advanced and with returning
strength storms nerves steadied and secure
in the knowledge that his guilt was buried
forever he took up the daily round once
more

  a week after the funeral he returned
to his sinecure at the offices of the mam-
moth trust company the neighbors
possibly because of georges forewarning
had left him considerately alone in the in-
terim but now as he stood on the station
platform awaiting his customary train for
the city the ubiquitous millard advanced
beaming

   by jove this is good old chap glad
you are getting back into harness again
best thing for you he exclaimed  fine
weather were having now and the course
is in wonderful condition never better
im in topping form if i do say it havent
missed a day

  despite his volubility there was an odd
constraint in his manner and storm eyed
him curiously could it be a latent sus-
picion

    	a-s

   youll be going in for the tournament
he inquired briefly

  surest thing you know too bad
you- millard caught himself up  i
say though why dont you get up early
now and then and play a round or two
with me before breakfast nobody else out
then and it would do you no end of good
how about to-morrow

  storm shook his head checking the
shudder which came involuntarily at the
suggestion

   thanks but im not quite up to it
i think ill let golf alone for a while he
replied adding hastily as he saw signs of
remonstrance in the others face  ive
got too much to do reinvestments to make
and that sort of thing

   of course millard nodded  youll
have your hands full but you would find
that an occasional round would set you
up wonderfully nothing like it to
straighten you out and take your mind off
things just phone me if you feel like it
any day old chap and ill join you

chapter xviii

escape

the appearance of several belated fel-
low-commuters saved storm from the
necessity of a reply and as they came
up to greet him he eyed each in turn fur-
tively

  they were cordial enough but none al-
luded directly to his bereavement and the
same constraint was evident in their bear-
ing that millard had manifested he con-
tinued to study them on the train from
behind the shelter of his newspaper un-
mistakable relief had registered itself on
their faces when the train came and now
a few of them were ostentatiously buried
in the market reports but for the most part
in groups of two and three they were dis-
cussing their business affairs and to the
listener their tones seemed unnecessarily
raised not one had ventured to take the
vacant seat beside him

  had the brewsters spread broadcast the
story of his emotional outburst in their pres-
ence and could it have occasioned remark


all-story weekly

started vague rumor and conjecture which
might yet lead to the discovery of the
truth in vain he told himself that he
was overanalytical that these old friends
shrank not from him but from dilating
upon his tragic loss to his apprehensive
imagination their manner held a deeper
significance than that of mere masculine
inability to voice their sympathy and with
gnawing persistency the menacing possi-
bilities rankled in his brain

  at the office after the formal condo-
lences of his associates storm slipped me-
chanically into the old well-ordered routine
but here too he fancied that he was being
eyed askance he could at least avoid
running the gantlet of his clubs for a time
without occasioning any remark but the
thought of greenlea itself and all that it
held for him had become obnoxious
hideous the return to that empty house
day after day could he endure it without
going mad

  he caught the club-car in a mood of surly
defiance but he had scarcely taken his
accustomed place when richard brewster
appeared and without waiting for an invi-
tation seated himself beside him

   awfully glad to see you on the job
again he spoke heartily and his beaming
face corroborated his words  we were
worried about you you know the other
night julie wanted to stay and take care
of you but holworthy wouldnt hear of it
i hope youve forgiven us for intruding
storm eyed him watchfully but the guile-
less friendliness of the younger man was
patent and the other sighed in relief

   i understand your motive and i thank
you both for coming he said after a mo-
ments pause  sorry i lost control of my-
self but id been keeping up for so long-
 it was only natural brewster inter-
rupted  youll be leaving us i suppose
for a time anyway as soon as youve got
the estate settled well miss you-

   leaving- storm stared

   youll go away for a-a rest wont
you new scenes and all that sort of thing
it will be hard for you to go on here-
the younger man broke off adding hastily
 julie was saying only this morning at
breakfast that if you decided to keep the

house open you would need a housekeeper
and she knows of a splendid woman an
elderly widow in reduced circumstances-

  storm halted him with an abrupt gesture
of negation

  i havent made any plans yet brewster
the maids ive got are used to my ways
and capable of running things temporarily
although it will be necessary to make other
arrangements of course if i decide to re-
main in greenlea the reply was mechan-
ical for his thoughts were busied with the
new vista which the others assumption had
opened before his mental vision  i am
grateful to mrs brewster for her interest
and if i need the woman of whom she spoke
i will let her know just now i am drift-
ing i havent looked ahead

  barker met him as usual at the station
and during the short drive home he glanced
about him at the smug familiar scene with
a buoyant sense of coming escape to get
away to cut loose now at once from all
these prying people the petty social inter-
course the thousand and one things which
reminded him of leila and of what he had
done

  the revulsion of feeling from the content-
ment of past years which had swept over
him that day culminated with a sudden rush
of hatred for it all the house loomed be-
fore him a veritable nightmare and the
coming days had appeared each a separate
ordeal from the prospect of which he shrank
with unutterable loathing

  he had felt chained to the old order of
things by the fear of arousing suspicion if
he ran away precipitately but the one man
of whose opinion he had been most appre-
hensive had himself suggested the way out
as the most natural course in the world

  storm could have laughed at his uneasi-
ness of the morning the other fellows had
been merely embarrassed that was all re-
luctant to mention his tragic bereavement
and trying with awkward constraint to
bridge over the chasm if they took it for
granted as brewster did that he would
sesk a temporary change of scene the main
obstacle was removed from his path it
would be a simple matter to sell the house
and then the world would be before him

  on the hall table he found a letter from
ashes to ashes



george holworthy and tore it open with an
absent-minded smile he would soon be
free even from old george he read

dear norman 

  tried to get out to see you to-night but must
meet abbott had a talk with jim potter yes-
terday the firm has ordered him to the coast
immediately and he is winding up his affairs
here and wants to get rid of his apartment
willing to rent furnished just as it stands cheap
until his lease is up in october it is a bully little
place up on the drive and the stuff he has there
is all a fellow would want to keep bachelors hall
why dont you take it off his hands and close up
the house out there jim will take his man
with him but you can get another and new
york is the best little old summer resort in the
world take my advice and get out of that
place for a while anyway i told jim id write
you but youve got to speak quick if you want
to take him up on it think it over

                                  yours

george

  storm folded the letter slowly he knew
potter knew the comfortable even luxuri-
ous sort of place his ease-loving soul would
have demanded yet he had wished to go
farther afield the first thought of escape
had entailed a vague dream of other coun-
tries south america perhaps or the far
east but now he forced himself sternly back
to the realities of the situation

  such an adventure would mean money
more ready cash than he could command at
the moment it would mean waiting until
the house was sold and burning his bridges
as far as the trust company was concerned
moreover the few thousands the house
would bring would not last long and unless
he connected with new business wherever
he went he had nothing to fall back upon
but the beggarly three thousand a year
which was left from his share of his fathers
estate he must convert the capital into
cash and foulkes had warned him that
that would take time could he wait there
within those four walls which had witnessed
what he had done

  he dined in a meditative silence oblivious
to the anxious ministrations of agnes the
empty place opposite the chair in its new
unaccustomed position against the wall the
silence and shadows all worked upon his
mood

  potters quarters in town would at least

bear no reminders to mock and accuse him
at every turn and drag his treacherous
thoughts back to a past which must be
buried he would be free too from brew-
ster and millard and the rest of them but
on the other hand george would be con-
stantly thrusting his society upon him

  undecided he wandered out to the ve-
randa but the vines which leila had tended
peered at him over the rail and whispered
together in the library her books her desk
the foolish impractical reading-lamp she
had bought for him all mutely recalled her
vanished presence there remained only
the drawing-room where her body had lain
the den

  with a shudder he turned and mounted
the stairs the blank closed door of her
room stared at him and within his own were
evidences on every hand of feminine
thoughtfulness and care her influence
vibrated like a living thing all about him
clutching him by the throat smothering
him anything anywhere would be prefer-
able to this

  it was only half past nine he could not
go to the country club he shrank from the
society of any of his neighbors he could
neither sleep nor read nor find a corner
which did not cry aloud of leila leila
there would be other nights like this weeks
of them

  in swift rebellion he descended to the
library seized the telephone and asked for
a number

   mr holworthy please that you
george yes norman ive got your let-
ter and youre right i cant stand it out
here ill take potters rooms at his own
price and i want possession by monday
all right fix it will you no but its got
on my nerves i cant go on i-its hell

chapter xix

change of scene

  old you youd like it here george
holworthy crossed one pudgy knee
over the other and eyed his friends
back at the window with immense satisfac-
tion old jim certainly knows how to live
doesnt he from percolators to night-lights


all-story weekly

youll be mighty comfortable here nor-
man

  storm turned slowly from his contempla-
tion of the shadowed park below the broad
sweep of river and twinkle of the palisades
beyond

   its great  he declared briefly but
with a ringing buoyant note which had
long been absent from his tones  i tell
you george old boy i feel like a new man
already i never knew until now how stag-
nant a backwater like greenlea can make a
fellow become same old trains same old
country club same old crowd of petty-
minded busybodies lord i dont see how
i stood it all these years

  the outburst was spontaneous and not
until he saw the look of reproachful amaze-
ment which crossed georges face did he
realize that he had lowered his guard

   you were happy ventured george

   of course storm hastened to ac-
quiesce  that made all the difference
but alone-

  he shrugged and turned away lest the
other read too clearly the change which had
come with his escape from the scene of his
crime significant of that change was the
fact that he could think of his deed as a
crime now without shrinking after the
first shock of horror and remorse had passed
together with the fear of detection a sense
of triumph began to dominate him a sort
of pride in himself and his achievement

  he had hoodwinked them all he who
had fancied himself a weakling merely be-
cause luck had been against him in the past
had proved his strength his invincibility
now old george sitting there so placidly
blinking at him with those good-natured
near-sighted eyes of his how little he sus-
pected how little he could ever suspect of
the truth the rest of them with their
smug condolences and pity gad how easy
it had been

   what do you think of homachi
georges question broke in upon his self-
congratulation

   the jap you got for me hes an im-
provement on agnes i can tell you storm
opened the bronze humidor and offered it
 smoke youve no idea how that girls
sniffling got on my nerves of course i

appreciated her feelings but hang it all a
man cant buck up and carry on with other
people constantly thrusting his own sorrow
at him

   homachi is a cheerful grinning little
cuss and he certainly can make an omelet
come up and have breakfast some sunday
morning and youll see

   thanks george spoke a trifle dryly
 glad you like him have you made any
plans yet about the disposition of the green-
lea house

  the constraint in his tone warned storm
that for the second time he had shown his
hand too plainly and he forced a look of
pained surprise

   disposition of the house he echoed
 heavens no its closed up of course
and ive left macwhirter there as care-
taker it was one of leilas last wishes
you know to give him employment when he
came out of the base hospital i hadnt
dreamed of disposing of it i couldnt bear
to think of strangers in her garden under
her roof in the home she so loved

    if im glad to be out of it its not that
i am callous but that everything about it
affects me too much george you ought to
be able to understand if i hug my grief
ill just simply go under and leila herself
wouldnt want that

   i do understand old man georges
voice trembled now with quick sympathy
and storm hid a smile of relief  youre
trying to be brave for her sake and it is
fine of you stay away from the place by
all means while it makes you feel that way
you could do worse than take a lease here
for yourself next year when jims expires
storm shook his head

  ive been thinking that id like to take
a trip somewhere later on he said slowly
watching the others face through narrowed
lids  a long trip china or south amer-
ica or away up north i could come back
and start all over again

   but your position with the trust com-
pany george sputtered  they couldnt
put a man in your place and then oust him
for you when you came back

   i wouldnt expect them to storm re-
sponded  to tell you the truth i feel that
ive been stagnating there too its a sine-
ashes to ashes



cure and ive been content to drift along
sure of the income and not taking chances
but im responsible for no one else now and
i can afford a risk

  george rose

   dont do anything rash he advised
 fifteen thousand a year is a mighty safe
little bet in these uncertain times and
youve never known what it is to get out
for yourself you know youve got the
habit of luxury-

  and no business head thanks
drawled his host pleasantly  im not
going to make a fool of myself and kill the
goose until i find golden eggs elsewhere
that notion of a trip was just an impulse
i may get over this restless fit and settle
down here permanently after all i like
these rooms of jims and town looks good
to me

  nevertheless the next day found him in
wendle foulkess office facing the keen old
attorney with an air of quiet command
which brooked no expostulation

   how long will it take you to convert
my securities into cash he demanded
 when we talked about it a fortnight ago i
listened to you because of my wife but now
ive only myself to consider and i have a
right to take a risk if i feel inclined with my
own

   of course you have my boy foulkes
returned slowly  i have gone beyond my
province perhaps in trying to influence
you but i promised your father-however
ive nothing more to say i will have the
cash for you in ten days you have exactly
fifty thousand dollars on which youve been
getting six per cent i hope youll be able
to better it

   thanks storm was conscious of an
air of defeat in the old mans manner and
he resented it vaguely then shrugged what
did it matter anyway he would be free
from this pettifogging nuisance soon enough
 about the other matter-

   you mean leilas estate foulkess
tone softened  i have the papers all here
for you to look over we must advertise
for claims for six months of course a mere
formality in this case and then what she
left can be turned over to you

   she had just fourteen thousand when

she married you and spent eleven of it
here are the accounts it was a matter of
pride with her to buy your christmas and
birthday presents with her own money
norman and i couldnt gainsay her two
thousand went for that black pearl scarf-
pin three thousand-

   dont storm cried sharply  i dont
want to hear all that you can send the
papers up to my rooms cant you see-

  he stopped with a gesture of repugnance
and the attorney ignorant of the source
of his emotion nodded compassionately

   i know my boy but i want you to see
how matters stand there are three thou-
sand left of the principal which were to
have been paid to jaffray for that land
adjoining yours and accrued interest on the
constantly depleted original capital which
aggregates almost as much again her
estate roughly speaking will amount to
between five and six thousand dollars ill
send you the exact figures

  i dont care about them im not
thinking of what she left it isnt that
storm rose unable to meet the kindly gaze
of the older man  i only want to get the
whole thing settled and done with i cant
bear to discuss it these details are horrible
impossible for me to contemplate sanely just
yet

   i quite understand norman but they
must be attended to you know foulkes
rose and held out his hand  ill render
you an accounting in six months and then
it will be over

   about your own affairs you have
never taken the advice i volunteered with
very good grace and i shall not offer any
now i am getting old and you are no
longer a boy you know your own mind
however if in the future you feel the need
of disinterested counsel or help you know
where to come for it

   thank you sir storm felt an odd
sense of contrition im not going into
that south american scheme i shall look
around before deciding definitely on what i
have in mind and im sorry if i have
seemed to resent your interest in the past
a man cant be in leading strings all his
life you know and i have a good conserva-
tive proposition now


all-story weekly

  he had storm chuckled grimly to him-
self as he departed fifty thousand would
carry him far away give him a year or two
of utterly care-free existence and leave a
respectable sum to start in some fresh ven-
ture the european countries were practi-
cally bankrupt a little cash would bring
monumental returns and in some conti-
nental capital he would start a new life

  just as the thought of escape from green-
lea had made his surroundings there sud-
denly intolerable so now the contemplation
of utter freedom and a wider vista brought
with it an impatience a longing for instant
action the lease on potters rooms the
trumpery five thousand from leilas estate
-these details need not deter or delay him

  another thought did however it was
one thing and a perfectly natural one
under the circumstances for him to have
closed the house and moved to town it
would be quite another question were he to
throw up a fifteen-thousand-a-year job
seize all the cash he could lay his hands
upon and rush out of the country no man
in his sane senses would take such a step
unless some more urgent and sinister motive
actuated him than a mere desire for forget-
fulness of grief in strange scenes and a new
environment

  forcing himself to regard it from a de-
tached point of view he saw the madness of
that course his imagination conjured up
the blank amazement which would ensue
not only among the greenlea people but
in his town clubs in the trust company
there would be hints that grief had un-
settled his reason then darker whispers
still whispers which would grow in volume
until the echo of them reached him wherever
he might be at the uttermost ends of the
earth

  he must not spoil it all now by a precipi-
tate move he must possess his soul in
patience until a favorable opportunity pre-
sented itself he had inserted an opening
wedge in mentioning his tentative intention
to george in a few weeks he would refer
to it again speaking of it casually but
frequent as a trip with definitely planned
limitations and hinting at a sound business
proposition which awaited his return the
idea must filter through the clubs and out

to greenlea must have become an old story
before he finally acted upon it so that his
going would occasion no remark

  once away it would be simple enough to
cable his instructions regarding the sale of
the house and postpone his return from time
to time until the old crowd had practically
forgotten him george would remember
but old george wouldnt suspect the truth if
he vanished to-morrow

  with the onus of fear lifted from him
storm still shrank from solitude decency
and convention precluded an immediate
return to his clubs and he desired above
all things to avoid the society of those who
knew him and the details of the recent
tragedy

  he took to satisfying his gregarious need
by seeking out-of-the-way hotels and res-
taurants frequented for the most part by
the visiting foreigners who thronged the
city where sitting long over his coffee he
could lose himself in the study of his
neighbors

  on an evening a few days after his inter-
view with foulkes he was seated at a table
in an old-fashioned french hostelry far
downtown listening to the snatches of stac-
cato conversation which rose above the sub-
dued cadences of the orchestra and watching
the scene brilliant with the uniforms of half
a dozen nations when to his annoyance he
heard his name uttered in accents of cheery
surprise

  turning swiftly he beheld millard
flushed and evidently slightly exhilarated
rising from the corner table where he had
been seated with a sallow-faced distin-
guished-looking stranger in mufti

chapter xx

a chance meeting

he bowed coldly and returned with
ostentatious deliberation to his en-
tree hoping to discourage the others
advance but millard was in no mood to
comprehend atebuff

   by jove old chap delighted to find
you here he shook storms reluctant
hand and without invitation pulled out the
opposite chair and seated himself  thats
ashes to ashes



the boy get around a bit and work up an
interest in life no use moping we miss
you out home but as i told dick brewster
change is the thing for you change-

   what are you doing here storm in-
terrupted him bruskly  thought you were
wedded to the three forty its been a bully
afternoon for golf

  business millard waved a pompous
hand toward the table he had just quitted
 golfs not in it with high finance and
this is the greatest proposition you ever
heard of hundred per cent profit in three
months and safe as a church good deal
safer than the churches on the other side
have been

  he grinned expansively at his own wit-
ticism then his face clouded dismally

   cant go into it though wife wont
hear of it and you know what it is storm
when a woman holds the purse strings
you know how im situated

  storm nodded every one in greenlea
knew that millard had married a rich wo-
man and suffered the pangs of hope deferred
ever since then he glanced up and frowned

   your friend is coming over he re-
marked in bored impatience  when you
gestured toward him he must have taken it
for an invitation

   sail right millard responded easily
 wonderful chap du chainat wonderful
proposition look here you spoke of
making some reinvestments heres chance
of a lifetime never heard of anything
like it gilt-edged-

  the stranger had halted by the table
and millard made as if to rise and then
thought better of it

   storm let me present m maurice du
chainat my old pal and neighbor mr
norman storm

 the frenchman bowed with courtly
suavity and storm could do no less than
proffer him a chair and beckon to a waiter

   mentioned your little proposition old
chap the irrepressible millard continued
adding airily as a shade of protestation
passed over m du chainats mobile coun-
tenance  oh i know its confidential but
storms all right he wants to make some
reinvestments and nows his golden oppor-
tunity

   mr millard has told me nothing of the
nature of your proposition monsieur
storm hastened to reassure the frenchman
 he merely mentioned it in passing

  for a long minute m du chainat re-
garded him in courteous but unmistakable
appraisal then a genial smile lifted the
ends of his small black mustache

   it is a confidential matter as m mil-
lard says but there is nothing-how do you
say-equivocal concerning it we of
france do not make our transactions ordi-
narily as you do in america we discuss
we deliberate we wait and yet in this
affair which i have undertaken haste is-
alas-of the utmost need time is of
value such value that i will pay twice over
for three hundred thousand francs

   you see its a factory in one of the
devastated towns millard interjected
eagerly  old feud trying to get ahead of
the other fellow it means sixty thousand
in our money and the french governments
giving him a grant of a hundred and twenty
thousand in three months but it means ruin
to wait other mans got his capital now-

   but my friend m storm is perhaps
not interested we bore him m du chai-
nat interrupted  the letter which our
consul here has given me to your great
banker m whitmarsh has interested him
to such an extent that the affair is all but
closed

  whitmarsh storm pricked up his ears
the proposition must be good if that most
astute of international financiers considered
it

   but yes the frenchman shrugged
deprecatingly  it is of course a trifling
matter to engage his attention but i am to
have a second interview with him to-morrow
a three i shall be happy to conclude my
mission for there is attached to it the senti-
ment as well as what you call business

  a second interview whitmarsh wasted
no time and this must mean a deal sixty
thousand dollars and doubled in three
months storm leaned impulsively across
the table

   what is your proposition monsieur if
i may ask it sounds a trifle-er-un-
usual

   it is the frenchman smiled again
	all-story

                                          -

 you will understand m storm that in
france it is not the custom to develop a
manufacturing concern until it grows too
big for us and then sell out to a corporation
with us the business descends from genera-
tion to generation it becomes at once the
idol and life of the family

   my father-in-law henri peronneau of
lille has a soap factory established by his
grandfather twenty years ago a dishonest
chemist in his employ stole the formula
which rendered the peronneau soap famous
and set up a rival factory both of course
were dismantled during the german occu-
pation

   m peronneau has been granted a loan
of six hundred thousand francs from the
government but it cannot be obtained for
three months yet meanwhile our rival has
acquired more than that sum from an en-
glish house and if his factory is the first in
operation it will steal all our old trade and
m peronneau who is already ruined will
have no opportunity to recoup

   he is in frail health from the slavery
of the invasion and his heart will be broken
three hundred thousand francs now will
enable him to compete with his rival for
his factory is in far better condition and for
that he is willing to pay the entire sum
which the government will lend him

   i admit that i have tried to obtain the
amount at a sacrifice less great but there
is no time for lengthy investigation and i
have found that people even in your gener-
ous america are afraid to trust to my cre-
dentials and the sponsorship of our consul
only a man of m whitmarshs experience
and caliber could comprehend that the
affair is bona fide that he takes no risk
voyez here is the personal letter which i
have received from him

  storm glanced over the single sheet of
terse typed sentences ending in the well-
crabbed signature and returned it to the
frenchman

   i congratulate you monsieur i know
whitmarshs methods and this looks as if
he intended to take you up on it

  m du chainat flushed with pleasure

   it is of great happiness to me he said
simply  almost  have despaired of my
mission at the hotel belterre where i am

weekly

staying there are so many of my compa-
triots here also to try to borrow that they
may rehabilitate themselves and with so
little success that i too feared failure but
m whitmarsh is shrewd he knows-what
you say- a good thing and he makes no
mistakes

  the conversation drifted into desultory
topics and after a half-hour m du chainat
took his leave dragging the reluctant mil-
lard with him as for storm he sat long
over his cooling coffee and until far into
the night he pondered the possibilities which
this chance meeting opened before him

  the difference between sixty thousand
dollars and a hundred and twenty meant
the difference between luxurious living and
the petty economies which would try his
soul between independence for years of
travel and care-free pleasure and the neces-
sity of knuckling down after a brief respite
to uncongenial money-grubbing it must
be all right if whitmarsh were going into
it and his letter left no room for doubt on
that score if he storm had only met the
frenchman first

  in the morning he tried to concentrate on
the affairs of the trust company but it was
of no avail the glittering opportunity
aroused all his gambling instinct and seemed
all the more alluring in that it was out of
his reach but was it perhaps whitmarsh
would fail for some reason to accept the
proposition not from lack of faith in jts
genuineness for he must have looked into
it with his usual caution before going so far
in the negotiations but he had been known
to turn down deals of much greater magni-
tude through sheer eccentricity

  if du chainat could offer bona fide
securities and he himself could obtain a
mortgage of ten thousand on the greenlea
house he could add that to his capital and
take the plunge

  at noon storm telephoned to the belterre
and asked for m du chainat

   this is storm talking millards friend
he answered  i called up monsieur to
tell you that if by any chance the whit-
marsh deal falls through i might consider
your proposition myself yes call me at
my rooms  riverside at six good-
by
environment



  he hung up the receiver slowly sup-
pose after all the man should be an im-
postor he would be risking all he had
in the world in the event that whitmarsh
did not take the proposition all that stood
between him and the accursed treadmill of
existence here within reach of the memories
which thrust out their tentacles to crush
him if that lille soap factory were a
myth-

  he reached for the receiver once more
and called the french consulate yes m
henri peronneau of lille was well known

to them his son-in-law m maurice du
chainat was now in this country negotiat-
ing a loan to reconstruct the peronneau
factory if mr storm were sufficiently
interested a meeting could without diffi-
culty be arranged

  storm turned away from the booth with
sparkling eyes if whitmarsh refused the
loan he would take a chance luck must
be with him still that marvelous luck
which had enabled him to elude the conse-
quences of his crime was yet running strong
at six oclock he would know

is man really civilized or is his ap-
parent civilization but an artificial cloak
that hides the primitive savage under-
neath and which in time of stress he
flings aside

  dillon weston who had soulful blue
eyes and hair of the exact shade of gold
which most women rave over always an-
swered the first question with a positive
affirmative these declarations were gen-
erally made while sipping tea amid a group
of feminine admirers of all ages from debu-
tantes to bachelor girls and were invari-
ably received with rapturous applause
there is nothing the average woman likes
better than to be assured of her absolute
divorce from the primitive

  and then fate shuffled the cards of life
anew and rang in on dillon weston what

can only be described as a cold deck of the
very coldest kind the eastern college
in which he held an assistant professorship
of geology organized an expedition to make
certain scientific investigations in the
northern section of the hudson bay re-
gion he was chosen to play an impor-
tant part in the work which included a
study of glacial action in the north in
those far-off days when labrador and the
new england states groaned under the
weight of an ice-cap more than a mile high
and to his credit be it said that he per-
formed his duties well enough to melt the
stony heart of fate had that organ been
susceptible to emotion

  but fate was ready just then to deal
from the aforesaid cold deck exactly ten
days before the expedition was scheduled


all-story weekly

to sail for home dillon westsn received
his new hand

  they were examining the northwestern
slopes of hudson bay in that far region
where the northern section of the barren
grounds begins to stretch an arm through
unbroken desolation across the northwest
passage to the pole trees even the stunt-
ed willows that cling to lowlands had van-
ished some distance farther south and the
tundra the gray-brown of its rocky surface
flecked with light-green lichens and the
faded remnants of red and blue summer
flowers stretched forbiddingly before them
everywhere was evidence of glacial action
in the denuded slopes of hills and in the
chiseled scorings of rocks

  during the preliminary examination the
members of the expedition were accus-
tomed to scatter in order to obtain a gen-
eral outline of their surroundings as speed-
ily as possible so it came about one
morning that dillon weston found him-
self alone at the half-concealed entrance
of a cave where the strata he had been
observing were more than usually interest-
ing

  he was in the presence of an appalling
ancient catastrophe at some time in the
far past a folding of the hills that could
only be described as tremendous had taken
place mighty mountain masses seemed
actually to have buckled together and in
the throes of settling down to have flung
huge masses of stone about like feathers
this had evidently occurred at the end of
the glacial period for parts of the up-
heaved strata bore no trace of the action
of ice

  within the cave his powerful electric
flash-light showed a wide lofty chamber
winding indefinitely into the semi-dark-
ness and displaying on its rocky sides
some unusual geological  faults he
took a few steps toward the rear then a
few more presently growing interested in
his work he found himself descending the
sandy floor of a wide cavern which ran
steadily but gently downward and which
was dimly lit as he afterwards discovered
through crevices high up on the mountain-
side

  the temperature was below freezing

which was only to be expected in a cavern
in that region of the world but it was so
far below freezing as to cause him to re-
sume his heavy gloves rather hastily from
the walls his flash-light struck vivid gleams
from crystalline schists he was some
yards below the surface and an eighth of a
mile from the entrance when the cavern
ended in a solid wall of ice the remnant
evidently of an ancient glacier

  there could not be the slightest doubt
about it caught and imprisoned between
folds of the rocks weighed down by mil-
lions of tons of dead weight the ice had
been preserved in that arctic climate until
his coming and would doubtless last while
the world stood

  it was all a fascinating spectacle for a
geologist yet dillon weston paid it scant
attention for there plainly visible in the
encircling ice natural as they had been in
that far-off day when they had fallen to
their death upon the glacier were the
bodies of two gigantic maned and shaggy
elephants which he knew to be not ele-
phants but mammoths

  for a moment he was too dazed to do
more than gaze at the extraordinary spec-
tacle the bones of the mammoth the
enormous prehistoric ancestor of the mod-
ern elephant are to be found in almost
every great museum the dullest school-
boy would recognize those mighty curved
tusks which could toss a present-day cow
as easily as the cow takes vengeance on a
troublesome dog but the mammoth him-
self in all the glory of his flesh and blood
has been found once only by man in 
in the frozen soil of siberia and here was
he dillon wteston gazing at two abso-
lutely perfect specimens through a thin
wall of ice

  for a moment his breath came in gasps
and his face paled he had won one of
the greatest prizes in his chosen profession
presently he knew his name would run
like wildfire around the world and he
would become famous beyond the average
scientists wildest dream which means
though dillon weston did not realize it
that if you canvassed a crowded meeting
in madison square garden you would find
at least two men who could recall his name
environment	

i he enjoyed the little walk back to his
chief more than any other walk he had
ever taken and then fate judging the
moment propitious dealt him a hand right
from the bottom of the pack that made
him gasp

  the work of removing the mammoths
from the cave involved the widening of it
at certain places and the installing of pow-
erful hoisting apparatus it would prob-
ably require two months at least working
in shifts-and navigation was even then
closing

    youll have to stay all winter dillon
to see that nobody-none of those eski-
mos i mean-destroy your find declared
professor smithers the head of the expe-
dition with an air from which there was
no appeal  its by long odds the biggest
thing the old college has ever done and we
cant afford to take chances well build
you a cozy cabin and leave you plenty of
coal for your stove and ill have the car-
penter double sash your windows and as
soon as the ice goes out of hudson bay
next spring well be back he thought
an instant  the men have all shipped
for the voyage so i cant leave one of
them and the rest of us are all married
so i suppose youll have to make out alone
dont mind that do you

   not the least bit in the world lied
weston cheerfully  ive always thought
it must be pleasant to try a bit of primi-
tive life

   dont try too much of it dillon ad-
vised professor smithers with ponderous
jocularity then he smiled assistant
professor weston with his soulful blue
eyes his clerical father and grandfather
and his eminently decorous outlook upon
life was not apt to become very primitive
and dillon weston smiled in return not
in the least because he felt like smiling
but because it was so eminently the proper
decorous thing to do considering that the
head of the expedition was making the
joke

  and then the vessel containing his col-
leagues steamed away and he was left
alone in a comfortable cabin with a good
stove and enough coal to last two winters
if necessary he had also a very satisfac-

tory supply of provisions and an excellent
working library on a shelf above the
stove he ranged the portraits of his father
mother and grandfather the two men in
clerical garb his mother wearing the black
silk he associated with meetings of the dor-
cas society while on the wall he tacked up
a program of geological investigation to be
pursued before winter settled down in
earnest

  the first night loneliness bit deep
then too he had trouble with the hang-
ing lamp which swung from the rooftree
when it had been put in order and he had
washed his blackened hands he looked out
upon the vastness of the starry night lis-
tened to the wind amid the boulders and
realized for the first time the desolation
that lay about him

  he was alone in a gameless wilderness
which had lain empty and sullen beneath
the sky since the dawn of time that he
could ever make friends with the monster
seemed preposterous but whatever hap-
pened he must not allow it to master him
that meant despair madness death the
commonplace trio of arctic winters

  september was a very pleasant month
frost was comparatively light and the
snow confined to one or two scanty falls
so that he was enabled to do some valuable
work in his special department the long
walks across the tundra gave him a tre-
mendous appetite and began to broaden his
shoulders and put muscle everywhere upon
his tall body

  in october snow interfered with his geo-
logical work but not in the least with his
outings he began to go about on snow-
shoes and in order to save the battery
supply of the powerful electric flash-lights
-specially constructed for the expedition
-of which he had several he installed in
the cave a complete lantern service with a
plentiful reserve of oil for of course it
goes without saying that he visited the
cave each day to gloat over his wonderful
discovery

  there was something fascinating about
these daily visits the gigantic forms of
the slain mammoths-killed evidently by
a fall from a cliff while fighting and buried
in the slowly forming glacier-awed him


all-story weekly

by their very vastness they had been
subjected to immense pressure as was evi-
denced by the clearness of the ice and in
the remote past had probably traveled
many miles from the scene of their fatal
quarrel ere the mountains had imprisoned
their section of the glacier forever

  their huge tusks were fortunately unin-
jured so that he was able to admire their
tremendous sweep at his leisure those of
one of the animals were bloodstained evi-
dently from clotted blood which soiled the
others shaggy mane mute evidence of the
ancient battle so much the perfect out-
line of the massive bodies and tusks was
plainly visible but even the powerful
flash-light was unable to bring out the de-
tails of the picture it was as though
these monsters of the prehistoric world
were still shrouded in the gloom of un-
numbed centuries

  with the coming of november the cold
grew more intense and the grip of winter
was unrelaxing the days were growing
very short now so that most of his time
was spent indoors where he busied him-
self with the writing of articles for scien-
tific magazines and with a serious attempt
at a book

  the wilderness now began to exercise
insensibly upon him that dangerous charm
which to so many lonely men has spelled
madness the stars blazed with strange
brilliance until the aurora dimmed them
with its vivid coloring when weston spent
hours watching the play of the mystic
lights then there were the unaccountable
optical illusions of the north the apparent
movement of rocks that he knew to be
solid as the rock of gibraltar and which
presently he knew would settle into their
places again the stars that seemed to fall
with a hissing noise into the frozen mass
of hudson bay the animation which at
times appeared to possess the most fixed
objects of the landscape causing them to
circle about the cabin with a movement
full of threatening meaning

  in this time of stress it was the practi-
cal undoubted fact of his discovery that
held him to the line of safety each day
he paid a visit to the cavern and each day
came away with a firmer resolve that the

world should not be deprived of these
strange treasures even if he had to spend
two winters in the north instead of one
and then one morning in february when
he least expected it the door of his cabin
was opened from without as he sat writing
and a tall fur-clad figure followed by a
shorter very broad-shouldered one ap-
peared upon the threshold

  well im damned cried the taller
of the two with a quick stare about him
 double-sashed windows some joint
this

  dillon weston welcomed them with a
puzzled air the nearest white men as he
well knew were hundreds of miles to the
south yet here were two calling on him
in the most casual manner in the world
 come in and shut the door he said hos-
pitably

  the shorter of the two a dark man
with a black ice-crusted beard closed the
door and came forward to the stove where
he stood combing the ice from his beard
with mittened fingers

   you probably heard of me before he
began  im sam powers the fur-trader
that owns the schooner lucy and this is
my first cousin pete ryan who sails the
lucy for me

  the tall man ryan who had now un-
covered a hard-bitten blond face marred
by an ugly scar diagonally across its right
side nodded confirmation

   the indians know us from the little
whale river on the labrador side down
through james bay and round to the nel-
son we have the best outlaw trade in the
bay but now- he shrugged his shoul-
ders expressively-oh hell

   stayed too late for once powers ex-
plained  got caught in a storm driven
over to this side and frozen in about thirty
miles to the south

  the eminently proper professor of ge-
ology who was listening with eager in-
terest formed a striking contrast to his
rough and ready visitors owing to the
heat of the room he had pushed back the
capote of the single-piece fur garment that
enveloped him from head to foot the
capote made a strange pendulous excres-
ence across his broad shoulders above
environment



which his neatly brushed hair gleamed like
the yellow nimbus of some missaled saint

   crew still on board weston asked
quickly

   three men and the grub-slinger an-
swered powers   filled in as mate and
took one watch and ryan here the other
shes pretty small you see and its a busi-
ness where too many cooks spoil the broth

  into westons mind as he listened came
some stray scraps of information regard-
ing the lucy and her unsavory reputation
when the indians go into the bush in the
fall to set their traps they take with them
a winters provisions for their family to be
paid to the hudson bay company in the
spring in the shape of furs the business
of the lucy it was to anchor in a conve-
nient harbor and buy from the indian hun-
ter for cash or provisions the very furs he
owed to the great company it was an un-
pleasant business based on the red mans
broken pledges and as such properly
looked down upon

  ryan meanwhile was gazing about him
at the large microscope which stood upon
the table beside a portable typewriter and
a pile of books at the little slabs of rough-
ly polished rocks mounted upon tiny
wooden bases and ranged upon a shelf at
the pasteboard drawings of strange strata
that lined the walls some joint he
said emphatically

  weston smiled as he began to prepare
his midday meal now that the surprise
was passing away he was conscious of a
feeling of profound content at once more
hearing the sound of a human voice what
he was not conscious of was the sharp
glances which the newcomers fastened
upon his store-closet when his back was
turned and the curious gleams of satis-
faction that appeared in their keen eyes

  half an hour later as they sat over
mugs of almost boiling tea powers hinted
the real object of their visit on the table
was a tin of snow water which weston
had melted that morning but which at a
distance of ten feet from the red-hot stove
was slowly turning into a solid block of
ice the fur-trader tapped it roughly
with his knife  rotten climate to be liv-
ing in isnt it

  weston nodded  i had seventy below
for three days straight last week he re-
marked  i had lots of coal and i kept
the stove blazing to the limit all day and
all night but things froze as soon as i
took them off the fire

   got lots of grub too havent you
asked powers

  weston shook his head  i took more
than i thought to need by a good deal
but looking it over yesterday v found
enough until june and maybe a little over
i suppose i have about eight hundred
pounds thats all

   on the lucy said powers curtly
 we havent any at all

  weston laid down his fork  havent
any he cried  do you mean-

   mean  interrupted the fur-trader
roughly  i mean we are starving do
you get that starving

  oh cried dillon weston greatly
shocked thats terrible

  he was silent an instant his blue eyes
clouded the thought of starvation in
that iron wilderness was too awful for
words and the worst of it all was that
he could not help

   what are you going to do he stam-
mered

  the black eyes of the fur-trader which
in their day had looked over many a tricky
bit of fur now bored into westons face
as though in search of a hidden weakness
he knew must be there

   its what you are going to do that
counts isnt it im waiting on you

   ill give you what i can spare cried
dillon weston hastily  but that isnt
much he thought an instant estimating
how he could curtail his daily allowance
in order to help and realizing the hopeless
inadequacy of his assistance  ill give
every ounce i can spare he added turn-
ing toward the store-closet

   spare broke in ryan with a laugh
 spare hear him say it hell

   there are six of us on the lucy
snarled the fur-trader  do you think we
want any of your damned charity you
havent been long in the north stranger
or youd talk different up here its man
to man and no favors and the weak go to

the wall dye get that the weak go
to the wall he turned to his friend and
barked a command  watch that side
pete

  ten minutes later the host of the small
dinner-party awoke from what seemed ages
of slumber there was a lump on his head
where he had fallen on the edge of his
bunk and a generally bruised feeling
throughout his body from a cut on his
forehead a tiny stream of blood ran saltly
into his mouth his visitors were engaged
in making two huge packs of the choicest
of his provisions

   why look whos here cried the fur-
trader pleasantly  hanged if our little
friend aint woke up to say  good-by i
call that a classy high-brow thing to do
dillon weston lifted his aching head and
stared earnestly at the speaker  where
are you going with my stuff he asked
hoarsely

   aint teaching grammar in the college
you was telling us about remarked ryan
plaintively  else youd say  going with
your stuff seeing that this chow has
changed hands

   as to our sailing directions remarked
powers  you can be sure were not head-
ing for the lucy there isnt enough chow
for all so wed only be waiting round
watching each other die were going to
make a sled out of some of your gear and
then beat it down south on snow-shoes
about seven hundred miles to an indian
camp we know

  he bent over to his work then suddenly
straightened up at the crunching sound of
snow-shoes on the frozen snow without
his face had grown pallid  god petey
its the boys he whispered

  ryan sprang toward the door hesitated
and turned backward as it was flung open
in his face and four fur-clad figures hurled
themselves helter-skelter into the room a
huge red-bearded fellow with a yellow
woolen scarf about his fleck in the van

  not a word was exchanged silently
with a savage malignity that was all the
more impressive from its entire absence of
speech the newcomers leaped upon the
owner and captain of the lucy and as
silently the others fought back

  looking on weston could see a blur of
surging forms that swept across the over-
turned table and battled savagely fero-
ciously up and down the interior of the
cabin the large miscroscope with which
he did so much of his work was flung on
the floor beside his shattered typewriter
the shelf of mounted specimens was tom
from its place and his trophies hurled hel-
ter-skelter on the floor and still the fight
raged on as though some savage animals
had been struggling for supremacy in the
heart of the jungle

  presently however there came a lull
powers and ryan bleeding from a dozen
cuts stood together beneath the window
one grasping the broken leg of the table
the other swinging aloft the arm of a shat-
tered chair while facing them were their
assailants leaning forward ready to spring

   suppose we talk this thing over boys
said powers and even in the midst of his
losing battle weston noted the ring of
courage in the mans voice whatever else
he might be the fur-trader was evidently
no coward  i got something to say if
twasnt for me you fellers wouldnt be here
at all

  ah hell said the red-bearded sailor
shortly  we know you met some eski-
mos that was going south because the wal-
rus had quit on them and they told about
the collidge feller being here thats all
right and then you up and says th ony
thing to do is to come up here and git
grub all right too but what aint all
right is fer you and pete to beat it up
here alone and grab it fer yourselves

  k its this way boys went on powers
earnestly  i figured the young feller
wouldnt have enough for the bunch so i
put it up to petey that him and me would
get chow enough to last us down the coast
till we struck white bears tribe you
remember white bear that give us those
black-fox skins last summer well i cal-
ate we could git grub and dogs there and
come up for you whilst if we all tried to
make it wed die in our tracks thats the
truth selp me

  truth hell cried the red-bearded
one i see ye going but not a coming
back
environment

  aw shucks cried powers indifferent-
ly weston watching could see him wet-
ting his dry lip with his tongue as he
played his last card  wouldnt we have
to come back before the ice took the lucy
out in th spring say wouldnt we

   thats gospel truth jack one of the
newcomers cried and weston could see
that the trader had made an impression
 it sounds good to me declared a second

   what  say is this ryan broke in
 lets cut out all this funny business and
draw lots whos to go south two has got
to go sam and me  stand aside and let
you boys choose among yerselves if ye want
it that way then the rest stays here till
help comes

  some shack cried one of the four
looking about him  it listens good
jack added another  anyway weve
got sam where wc want him said a third

  the red-bearded giant nodded agree-
ment  all right sam he said gruffly
 chuck down your club and cooky you
get busy and lets have the best you got
rustle some bacon first thing

   righto was the answer of the dirtiest
and most villainous of the four as he
stepped forward  got th best uv every-
thing boys was his awed remark as he
surveyed the packs which powers and
ryan had shoved in the corner at the ap-
proach of danger  some chow believe
me 

  as dillon weston stood beside the stove
the whole affair seemed both real and un-
real like one of those strange dreams in
which the dreamer appears to awaken
even while the dream runs on the sun-
light streaming through the window threw
the interior of the cabin and its occupants
into relief with the clearness of a stere-
opticon surely this could not be the
peaceful room in which two hours before
he had been writing up his journal the
thing was incredible in a sudden gust of
anger he stepped forward

   where do i come in he demanded
 nowheres answered the red-bearded
man sharply  and if ye give any talk 
-he lifted a huge fist- ill show ye what
oclock it is he laughed quietly  ye
dont come in anywheres we aint got

enough to go round as tis he turned to
the others  what  we do with him
boys

  dillon weston to do him justice was
no coward when the fur-trader and his
ally had attacked him he had been too
dazed to do more than gaze at the astound-
ing spectacle of their treachery now he
had recovered his self-possession more-
over he was angry in a cold-blooded way
that made him dangerous he struck him
of the red beard a blow that echoed through
the room

  dillon weston was a man of unusual
physical strength in addition he had as
gymnasium work taken lessons in boxing
not many years before so that the con-
test should have been fairly equal but
fighting as practised in the rough corners
of the world is a very different thing from
what the prize-ring knows as fighting as
john morrissey once had the misfortune to
prove

  as a boxer red-beard would probably
have made a wise audience laugh itself to
death as a rough and tumble fighter in a
cabin in the arctic he proceeded to prove
in a class by himself as weston bleed-
ing and defeated lay upon the floor of the
cabin he felt an odd feeling of admiration
for the man who had beaten him an un-
willing tribute to an enemy but still a
tribute

  game enough was red-beards ver-
dict as he stanched his bleeding face
 question is what to do with th fool
theres not enough grub to go round i
say croak him

   an have the college people come back
next summer and raise the whole country
up protested powers im fer giving
him a mite of grub and turning him out
doors say he dies somebodys got to die
afore spring maybe more than one he
ended darkly

   and if he dies its only starvation
cried another  we can say he got dippy
and wandered away lots gets batty up
here everybody knows that

  so it came about half an hour later that
dillon weston went into exile from the
cabin in which he had fought his losing
fight went into exile with his furs and


all-story weekly

clothes some cooking utensils a small bag
of flour a few beans and some pilot bis-
cuit he had plenty of tea an article
which the sailors despised but not a trace
of meat or fat one of the men had pro-
posed allowing him a tin of lard but the
suggestion had been frowned upon lard
being recognized as too great a delicacy to
be lightly parted with

  that night he sat in the shelter of the
cave thinking over his misfortunes above
him suspended from a jutting rock was
the lantern he had kept in the cave to
save his flashlight in a hollow below him
was a small stove originally intended for
the cabin but discarded as too small which
the rascals had allowed him to take in a
pile beside him was a supply of coal which
he intended to increase next day an agree-
ment having been reached by which the
overabundant store of fuel should be di-
vided in equal shares the lantern swung
fitfully in the gusts that drove in from the
desolate tundra and the stove smoked

  that afternoon he had found a crevice
in the rock that apparently led through a
tiny hole to the outside world for watching
closely it was possible to detect a faint
glow of daylight with a little work he
would be able to make an excellent chim-
ney of it meantime his stovepipe was
not long enough to reach into the crevice
and the stove smoked persistently

  these however were minor discomforts
what mattered really was the unpleasant
fact that he was now face to face with
starvation as it is known in the north

  in that wide desolate land he was quite
alone no animal life existed on the frozen
wastes of the tundra no bird crossed the
gray sky not even a walrus lifted a tusk
in that awful stillness wherever he looked
a white death seemed to wait mockingly
both for himself and the men of the lucy
left to himself he would have passed safe-
ly through the winter the advent even of
one more would have spelled disaster
while the intrusion of the six meant a quick
death for all concerned

  had the fur-trader and his companion
escaped southward with the bulk of the
provisions it was barely possible that they
two might have won to safety that they

would have been able to bring back aid
even had they been so minded he did not
in the least believe as the situation now
presented itself there was nothing to look
forward to but death by starvation

  the provisions he had lost would not
keep the crew of the lucy alive much more
than a month at most after that-dillon
weston shrugged his shoulders with su-
preme indifference he would not be there
to see so what matter

  next morning he awoke at daylight and
began the tiresome task of removing the
rest of his coal supply to the cave powers
who stood beside the cabin watched him
carelessly as though he had other things to
think of from the interior of the cabin
came the sound of loud voices that of the
red-bearded man more strident than the
rest evidently the inmates were not quite
satisfied with the situation

  later in the day when he had packed
the remainder of his coal to the cave he
set to work to make the place more habit-
able the entrance was fairly narrow
now he built a snow rampart in front of
it with a tortuous winding passage lead-
ing by a narrow doorway into the cave it-
self the twistings in the passage would
break the force of the wind and help to
make the cavern warmer

  with snow and water he fashioned a
long tube that acted as an excellent con-
tinuation of his stove pipe and did away
with the smoking that had annoyed him
and having thus put his house in order
dillon weston sat down to wait for death

  he did not blink the fact it was some-
thing to be faced neither did he blame
the men of the lucy after all life was a
struggle in which the weak went to the wall
all right he could do it without useless
whining and as a preliminary he de-
cided not to go near the cabin no matter
what happened if he had to die he would
die by himself as the old cavemen crawled
off tc their dens when their time came

  a couple of weeks passed and despite
the strict limits he imposed upon himself
his supplies were practically at an end
hunger was gnawing at him as in violation
of his resolve he walked slowly across the
tundra toward the cabin
environment



  suppose it were possible to regain pos-
session of his stores the idea startled
him then he put it aside as absurd one
man does not overcome six except by a
miracle from the cabin as he approached
came a faint far-away odor of frying ba-
con infinitely enticing his body was
trembling as he walked away with the
effort it had cost him not to abandon his
last shred of self-respect and beg its in-
mates for food

  to change the current of his thoughts
he returned to the cave and taking up the
lantern went into the recesses of the cav-
ern to gloat over the huge bulk of the
mammoths which he hoped would become
known to posterity as the  dillon weston
discovery so much had happened since
the arrival of the fur-trader that he had
not once visited his prize now as he
stood before the strange monsters coeval
as he knew with primitive man he be-
came slowly conscious of a change

  the gigantic shaggy-maned animals
were no different from what they had been
when his startled eyes first fell upon them
wonderful scientific treasures at which the
scholastic world would wonder

  the change was in himself his sense
of values was different the bitter arctic
waste the barren tundra upon which wind
blew the snow in huge drifts that were full
of strange runic lines the long nights
when the walls of the cabin cracked from
frost with the report of a rifle the slow
starvation which was weakening him each
day-all had combined to give him a new-
er more primitive view-point

  far off in the old life he had left so long
behind the mammoths had a scientific and
educational value now as he stood in
front of them he was conscious of them
only as a cave-man would have been-as
food for the animals killed by their fall
upon the ice and buried under snow and
ice in the unbelievable cold of the glacial
age represented thousands upon thou-
sands of pounds of fresh meat and the
man muffled in furs to the eyebrows who
gloated over the sight could have told you
that meat was more than raiment and a
good deal more than all the colleges in the
world

      a-s

  he was staggering from weakness as he
returned to his quarters for an ax the
fore-shoulder of one of the animals was
within a few inches of the surface a few
minutes labor freed it from ice after which
came the difficult work of cutting through
the tough hide to the frozen flesh beneath
nearly half an hours exertion was required
before a huge piece of meat dark as that
of the walrus lay in his hands two
hours later dillon weston could have told
you that mammoth steak was the finest
eating in the world and what is more he
would have believed it

  two weeks went by in storm and tem-
pest snow drifted into the pathway to
the cave until it was entirely covered and
he was compelled to keep the lantern burn-
ing continuously until he hit upon the ex-
pedient of making candles out of the tal-
low of the mammoth meat

  thereafter he reserved the lantern for
his visits to the far end of the cave and
did his cooking by the light of a pair of
the strangest candles in use since time be-
gan then the storm ceased and he dug
his way out of the cave to the light of a
perfect winter day

  but for his snow-glasses the glare from
the white surface of the tundra would have
been blinding far and wide endless
slopes of dazzling snow reflected the light
from a myriad crystals the frozen surface
beneath him creaked under his snow-shoes
as he walked toward the cabin he was con-
scious more than ever in his life of the
joy of living

  a silence brooded over his old home
that was not dispelled as he drew near
pushing open the door he found the owner
and crew of the lucy huddled around the
fire evidently they had been unable to
spare food to send two men south pow-
ers looked up stared in surprise as though
he had seen a ghost swore softly under his
breath and was silent the red-bearded
sailor who sat on the edge of westons
bunk spat savagely upon the stove as he
growled an oath but no one offered a re-
mark

   ive finished all that stuff i took away
weston began  can you let me have a
little more


all-story weekly

   more hell exclaimed red-beard
  theres one pilot biscuit left and were
 going to draw lots fer that

     say divide it said ryan huskily
  then every man  git a taste

   ah whats a taste scoffed powers
  lets draw then the one as wins gets
 a couple of real mouthfuls before he cashes
 in

    there was a little murmur of assent and
 xed-beard began assorting several slivers
 of wood weston stepped forward  im
 in on this he said sharply  it was my
 biscuit in the first place

   red-beard looked at him out of inscru-
 table eyes  i told the boys you were a
 game bird he said slowly  now youre
 showing it he stroked his flaming beard
 with a monstrous hand  when a man
 has a charce to live he went on  he
 sometimes has ter be hard but when hes
 going ter cash in-hell whats th use
 im willin ef th boys is

   all right barked powers and the
 rest nodded assent  give the guy a
 chanct fer a last bite advised the cook

 and the drawing began

    a minute later red-beard handed to dil-
 lon weston the prize he had won then
 he leaned back against the bunk and spat
 upon the stove  ye won it fair young
 feller said he briefly  now git tell
 with it

   as weston walked rapidly homeward
 the pilot biscuit in his hand he recalled
 the scene in the cabin not a hand had
 been raised to stay his departure though
 he had noticed more than one pair of shoul-
 ders quiver rough hardened as the men
 were they had stood true to their code-
 which is all that can be said of any man
 two hours later he staggered into the

cabin again and flung a heavy burden on
the table and that night six men beyond
the pale of law and one erstwhile decorus
member of a college faculty ate fresh meat
in a cabin where a red-hot stove was un-
able to keep water liquid five feet away
and found the room too warm while the
arctic atmosphere vibrated with the mel-
ancholy roaring of ancient chanteys and
in this manner did the wilderness take dil-
lon weston to itself

  even the complete loss of the mammoths
did not upset him two tons of meat and
fat had been removed and stored in the
cave when the ice split asunder and the
animals vanished beneath a projecting
ledge taking with them a funeral mound of
thousands of tons of ice but there was
food enough to keep the little group from
starving and that and not curio seeking
was the essential thing as weston could
have told you

  professor smithers on his return in
june accepted the disappointment with
scientific self-possession  youre looking
well dillon he remarked pleasantly
 and i hope you didnt get too near the
primitive when i was away

  thinking of the six rascals gone three
weeks before for whom he would ahvays
have a warm spot in his heart dillon
weston shook his head he had of course
no intention of mentioning his visitors
 maybe im not of primitive type
professor smithers looked down at his
own neat rubbers  of course not dil-
lon you and i have left the primitive
stage of evolution thousands of years be-
hind we could not possibly return to it
dillon weston gazed across the grav-
green surface of the tundra and smiled an
inscrutable smile

 the time approaches

bryce lighted a cigar  that wo-
mans got all the moral qualities of
a high-class vamp he remarked as
we spun away down the drive  consid-
erin her friends i bet there was some
strong stuff pulled at those entertainments
of hers

   and yet i said recalling the faces
of more than one of the attendants at the
mallory service the day before  she ap-
pears to be well received

   by society you mean

  i nodded

  jim grunted  th only difference be-
tween what i said an a certain class of
society m son is that one hasnt been
found out an th other has

   well i changed the topic of conversa-
tion  we appear to have drawn another
blank no matter what the ladys stand-
ing is

  bryce removed his cigar and blew a
cloud of smoke  hell yes he agreed
without any special emotion  but we
been doin that for days we go back now
and tell dual weve drawn it i suppose
i agreed by another nod there really
seemed nothing else to do this was the
fourth day we had been at work and
thus far we had little enough to show
semi-dual and semi-dual alone as it
seemed to me had been able up ta now

to gain any really definite conception of
the matter his positive statement that
in his opinion the murder of peaches had
been something unintended his warning
against the attempt on gladyss life how-
ever would surely seem to indicate that
he had at least a theoretical knowledge of
some of the hidden moves that were taking
place anyway he had told us to see mrs
lee and that was as good as a definite
order to report all things considered it
seemed best to visit next one possessed of
his peculiar ability to learn the truth by
reading the stars themselves before seeking
to establish it by facts

  but though i assented and we left the
cab in front of the urania doors we ere
destined to meet an interruption to our
purpose at least for edwards was waiting
in front of the building

   been waiting for you he began as
i turned from paying the driver  i dont
know if its important or not but gregson
drove up in a tearing hurry and went into
pallss office just about an hour after you
left i went up to your place but they
told me you were out so i came down
here to slip you the information and now
im off to the jail i guess

   all right much obliged old chap
i accepted  of course palls may have
called him over or not but the things
of interest at least i told miss vance
you were coming over so you better keep
my word

this story began in the all-story weekly for september 




all-story weekly

  he hurried off and i glanced at jim he
shook his head like myself i suppose he
was wondering just then whether greg-
sons visit to the broker had anything to
do with our call about the card he made
no audible comment however and we en-
tered the ingoing stream of traffic to catch
an upgoing cage

  one might have sensed that dual had
been doing some of that reading i had
thought of as we entered the room where
he was sitting at his desk it was cov-
ered by a mass of papers bearing circle
and symbol and sign the characters of
astrological figures  had come to know so
well as the sign manuals of his work

  he motioned us to chairs

   you come at a good time my friends
he greeted  i trust you have seen the
woman of the sables and the exceedingly
light blond hair

   blond hair said jim sitting down
 oh yes weve seen her shes some jane
when you get right up against her that
hair of hers makes you think of a circassian
side-show freak i wouldnt have been sur-
prised to see her reach into a basket and
pull out a snake

   a charmer may not always confine
her ability to reptiles semi-dual made
answer  but i have reasons of my own
at this time for hearing without delay what
your efforts may have produced

  i told him when he spoke like that
as i very well knew there was no time for
discussion and even as i sank down into
my accustomed chair at the end of the desk
i felt that surely in my absence he had been
reading-learning things i knew not of
yet hinted at by the urge in his words and
manner things veiled to the comprehension
of all save one who like himself could in-
terpret those strange charts of astral mean-
ing before him on which as we entered he
had been engaged

  i told him all the story of the day of
our visit to palls of our call on gladys
vance of our interview with the eccentric
mrs lee in the wvndham house our re-
cent meeting with edwards

  and as before  found a tiny spark
shining in the depths of the gray eyes he
unveiled when i had closed

   your information fits in admirably with
my own investigations he said  little
by little the veil is being torn asunder-
things tend to grow clear at last

   well my iord jim said  im glad
to hear it even if i cant see it myself
up to now there aint a thing been clear
to me except that this jane knew mallory
and gregson and palls an that them two
no matter what they say are somehow
mixed up in this case palls made a
pretty good bluff when we saw him this
mornin ill admit but-it wasnt quite
good enough

  dual turned toward him as he answered
 in telling you what he did this morning
mr bryce it is my opinion that mr palls
told you absolutely the truth

  what bryce sat up sharply his
voice rose in the involuntary accents of
amazed surprise for a moment he sat
staring back at dual in a fashion almost
unconsciously antagonistic then he re-
covered himself in a measure  howt do
you make that out he asked

   by means of my computations dual
gestured slightly to the mass of papers be-
fore him  you yourself obtained the re-
corded birthdates of the two men palls
and gregson for me if you remember
from the figures i have erected upon those
dates as a basis i am led to the positive
belief that neither man had more than
an incidental connection either with the
death of noriene mallory or the attempt
on miss vances life

  he spoke clearly calmly as one might
state a wholly abstruse fact conviction
a definite positive quality of absolute be-
lief inspired his voice and after that for
a time silence came down in the room save
that as semi-dual paused jim took a
single rasping breath expressive more of
complete futility i think than of anything
else

  i couldnt blame him either considering
what had just been said if gregson and
palls were innocent of guilty knowledge
i couldnt really see just where semis pro-
nouncement of the fact left us myself
and now-now when suddenly they were
withdrawn from the equation as they had
been since it did not occur to me to doubt
the ivory pipe





duals conclusions i found that almost
without knowing i had been rather count-
ing upon one or both of the men in ques-
tion as at least a possible means to the
solution of the mystery from the first

  indeed as it seemed to me now they
had constituted the only real leading we
had encountered besides that things had
kept coming up to support the theory that
they did know something-things such as
edwards had expressed last night when
he had pointed out that palls had known
he was sending flowers to the jail had been
in a position to make use of the knowledge
had he wished consequently upon me
as well as on jim semis positive asser-
tion had a disconcerting effect which for
the time being well nigh robbed me of the
capacity for lucid speech

   but semi i did manage what sounded
rather like an appeal at last

  he smiled there could be no doubt
but that he understood that he knew just
how completely his words had upset us
both and the reason for it his smile
showed that understanding and his voice
when it came

   let not anything i may have said dis-
turb you my friends remembering as you
must remember that up until this time
those things those facts and findings with
which we have dealt have been unavoid-
ably obscure-that i told you in the be-
ginning that we must work and wait to-
gether the effects brought about by the
causes set into motion that in my opinion
the matter on which we have been engaged
would run a cumulative course and the
course of cumulation is like that of the
sand bar in the river which through the
carrying to it of the particles out of which
it is built slowly enlarges and grows each
bit of which amounts to little in itself
save that it is an integral portion of the
mass

   you mean i said  or i hope you
mean that we have contributed in a
measure to the sum total of knowledge that
is beginning to make things clear as you
say at last

  he inclined his head  and in no small
measure either since though each grain
of sand in the river bar while no more

than a sand grain really may by its posi-
tion in the integral whole assume an im-
portance entirely unsuspected as for in-
stance the color of the flowers sent by mrs
lee to grace the funeral of her friend
which as it appears from your account of
your conversation this afternoon she was
at more or less trouble to explain

   huh suddenly bryce came out of
the abstraction that had held him since
semi had pronounced his dictum regard-
ing gregson and palls  what about th
color whats it got to do with sand
 with sand nothing said semi-dual
excusing that inability of jims to under-
stand the forms of symbolism he was so
wont to use as his means of expression
 but there is truth now as always in the
saying that  eyes have they and they see
not ears and they hear not since we
who denominate ourselves men and women
are prone to permit the eyes and ears of the
spirit to be blinded and numbed by the
physical eyes of the mind yet the eyes
of the spirit exist and he who knows the
means of their employment will find that
he can read let me ask if you have ever
associated the color red with mourning
mr bryce

   with mourning jim repeated while
i experienced a sudden sensation best
described by a tightening of the nerves
 why no ive always associated it with
something more like a celebration-fourth
of july and chinese new year

   exactly said semi-dual  and yet
red is also used largely in their burials by
the chinese

   the chinks jim burst jut in visible
excitement  that womans got one for
a butler an mallory had that pipe in her
rooms an lee sends red roses to her fun-
eral an- say-

   the sand bar in the rivers course
said semi-dual  grows with the addition
of each grain of sand

  the sand-bar grows were the pipe
the color of the funeral flowers the friend-
ship between the two women the fact that
the lessee of the wyndham house employed
an oriental servant grains of sand was
that what dual meant and was the sand-
bar in the course of the river something


all-story weekly

which should some day bar its further
progress or check it at least-a something
growing stronger a more definite barrier
approaching nearer and nearer to the time
when it should block the swirling force of
the very current that had built it with each
added bit of evidence was that it

  had dual by his means of learning the
unknowable as it seemed at times been as
it were the initial bar to the dark course
of the flood of human passions and sordid
material purpose let loose by whoever was
responsible for what had occurred and
had each fact each item of knowledge
bryce and i had brought to him been built
into the fabric he had been slowly erecting
for the staying of that course for days
all at once it seemed to me that this and
this only could be the true interpretation
of his strangely cryptic words and if so
then too i could understand his welcoming
remark that we came at a good time his
urge that i tell my story without delay

  his work had been well-nigh complete
he had only needed for its completion a
few-perhaps a very few-additional
 grains of sand had we furnished them
i wondered was the barrier in the path
of the guilty now complete had it been
built up through our joint efforts had
we without knowing so far as bryce and
i were concerned succeeded

  suddenly it seemed to me that we must
at least be on the verge of success since
semi had said all things were becoming
clear at last-semi-dual-my inscrutable
wonderful friend-this modern mystic-so
practical in his mysticism after all who
had said that we three were seekers after
truth all at once as the thought gripped
me with the force of a conviction i lifted
my head and met his watching eyes

  they were on me i knew he had been
watching me all along that they under-
stood what had been going on in my
puzzling brain and now they smiled back
at me wtith perfect understanding

   patience he spoke softly including
both jim and me in his further words
 not yet is the time of justice my friends
but it approacheth with the slow march
of the judge when wtith dignity he gathers
his robes about him and takes his place

even now the court of high justice is
sitting in judgment on the guilty cause
and effect are the accusers and the jurors
are the stars justice shall be done at the
appointed time and shall prove but a carry-
ing out of that verdict which is theirs but
for the present let the trial proceed in good
faith of the final findings since there re-
mains another element as yet to enter
the case

  and as before he spoke with a positive
conviction with the air of one with un-
shaken faith in his words i believed
strangely enough as i sat there and lis-
tened all doubt of the results to be achieved
died out of my heart that calm avowal
of the unswervable march of justice toward
an appointed end swept me up and seemed
to carry me forward to the final time when
the newer element he mentioned should
have brought the matter to an ending even
though i had no least conception of what
it was

   after all then i said at length  the
whole matter revolves about the ivory pipe
it was the first grain of sand

   it was an important grain of sand be-
cause ef its position semi said

   i dont make it i dont make it at
all jim complained breaking through the
silence that had held him in a sort of
morose brooding  whadje mean ill
admit it was a handsome thing was there
somethin funny about it like these temple
jewels that have been swiped out of idols
now and again is that what it was

   there was nothing of what you mean
about the pipe mr bryce dual replied
 nor in the funeral flowers in themselves
each is no more than a leading an in-
dication-a something to be read not so
much by the eyes of the mind as of the
soul yet each as one might say estab-
lishes in a certain measure the key note of
this pitiful affair for the pipe wras the
pipe of pan and the flowers things of
ethereal beauty in themselves become at
the last the pall that covered the limbs of
a human flower spotted by the filth of the
world-of material indulgence-of what
those of a satryistic nature call earthly
pleasure before they were laid in the grave

   truly my friends is it said that  the
the ivory pipe



wages of sin is death and as light de-
feats darkness ever and good overcometh
evil so too doth the sinner having wrought
his evil doing receive his wage those
who live in the flesh in the flesh and by
the flesh shall they perish even as the
germ of a disease by its very growth in
the body sets up the causes destined in
the end to effect its own dissolution dooms
itself to death through the substances its
own ill activities produce

   and as near as i can make that out
said jim  you mean that this bunch who-
ever they are are going to hang them-
selves

  semi-dual inclined his head in a
measure yes that will be true in effect
at least since it is they who themselves
have created a retroactive cause

  jim took another deep breath his
manner was somewhat dazed  an i
suppose accordin to that there aint nothin
to do but wait

   wait aye semi-dual told him  until
you are called upon again to work

   semi  i cried arrested by the word-
ing of his answer  do you mean that
-that its nearly finished

   as yet no he replied directly  yet
the time approaches when it will be my
exact meaning is that in my sincere be-
lief those further steps required to bring
about its ending depend largely upon my-
self hence return now to your accustomed
ways yet hold yourself in readiness to act
 return i gasped

   aye full of the grateful knowledge
that more than one soul shall be again up-
lifted that you have acquired fresh merit
through your work

  dismissal it was nothing less i felt
startled puzzled amazed and hurt i rose
and bryce followed or was it dismissal
already my first shocked feeling of pique
was passing semi had said the rest of the
affair would depend largely upon himself
and-we were to return until once more
we were needed as always dual had
stated the necessities of the issue that
was it i felt a trifle better as we left the
roof

  not so bryce his face was a dull red
from suppressed emotion  fired-kicked

out he exploded as the chimes died away
behind us and we descended the stairs
 told to beat it and given a bone of
 acquired merit  to gnaw on maybe
things are clear to him but the only thing
clear to me is that he dont consider us
of very much use

   hold on old man i said and pointed
out what conclusions regarding the matter
i had formed already for myself

   huh  he grunted when i had fin-
ished  well by granny maybe youre
right m son his expression cleared

chapter xxiii

norman haddon

we went down and entered our office
for the first time that day so far
as that went however we were
fortunate in having as our representative
in our absence a very efficient young wo-
man who had been with us from the first
-miss nellie newell

  she glanced up from her desk as we
came in together and rose to intercept us

   mr glace she announced  there is
a mr haddon-a mr norman haddon
-has called twice to see you this after-
noon the last time he decided to wait
and i gave him a chair in your private
room

   thank you miss newell i said
haddon was a man i had known for some
time rather better than some people knew
him but he was the last man in the world
i had expected to-day i glanced at bryce
his face was an unvoiced interrogation
he also was acquainted with haddon
though not so well as myself

   stick around i told him  ill see
what he wants

  then i entered my private room

  mr norman haddon sat there impec-
cable in dress and grooming a very fashion
plate as always debonair and smiling in
seeming a rather idle rather bored and
blase example of the type best described
as a man about town

   oh hello old chap happened to be
in your city and thought id take the op-
portunity you know of renewing old ac-


all-story weekly

quaintance not disturbing you am i dear
old fellow what he said in the sort
of english aped by so many of his ap-
parent class as i closed the door

   not at all i replied taking the
languid hand he extended to tell the
truth i liked the man despite his actually
foppish ways or not so much in spite of
them either but because i knew that they
really were a mask behind which lurked
the real haddon as a hunter may lurk in
a blind

   awfully good of you to say so old
dear he remarked as our fingers touched
and i laughed in his face

   forget it haddon i prompted  cut
it out

  he knew well enough that i referred to
his manner and he followed my suggestion
with a vengeance  glace he said in
a wholly altered fashion jerking his head
slightly to one side  is yours a sound-proof
door-

  my interest quickened i glanced at
the entrance to the room i had just closed
behind me

   well i hastened to assure him  up
to now its never been impeached but
whats the answer

  he smiled slightly as he responded  as
a matter of fact my visit isnt  quite so
casual as it appears whats this i hear
about the arrest of gladys vance

  and if he had quickened my interest a
moment before he intensified it now
what interest i asked myself did norman
haddon one of the  unknown  agents
of the federal intelligence service a man
who had done wonderful work for his
country in the past even while seeming
to have no aim or object in life beyond
his own pleasures have in gladys vance

  then as i felt his brown eyes waiting
for my reply to his question i told him
 well as it happens its the truth its
a most peculiar case too haddon and
has had bryce and me up in the air for
several days right now things appear
to have reached what one might call an
impasse

  he nodded  tell me about it he said
 the charge is murder i believe

   first i suggested as he settled him-

self in his chair to hear my story  let me
ask what you know about the vance girl
yourself

   met her in new york he responded
briefly  knew she was in the city called
to see her and found her-out found out
she was also in-jail and that you were
working in her interests in the matter
dont believe she did anything like the de-
tails i have gathered always seemed a
thoroughbred sort of girl to me wouldnt
mind helping her out of a pickle if there is
anything i could do thought i might even
call on her in jail if you could fix it got a
lovely voice as i know myself pity to cage
it now shoot

  for a moment i studied the man before
i complied casual as was his explanation
i wondered if he were telling me the truth
he was a peculiar article was haddon he
had to be to have done the unheralded work
he had been doing as i knew for years-to
have won to his present position where he
stood high-how high even i myself was not
sure-in the department confidence but
his attitude of passive waiting told me noth-
ing i gave it up and began

  and i guess i made my narrative pretty
complete because as i went on i found a
positive relief to talk about the case

   rum go he made comment as i
reached an end actually he aped the
vapid so much in his conversation that it
crept more or less into his serious speech
honestly you chaps seem to be pretty well
up against a wall do you suppose now by
any chance that the little lady has fallen a
trifle short of telling you the truth i dont
mean that shes deceived you exactly in
what shes told you but that she simply
hasnt seen fit to tell you all she knows

   as a matter of fact i hud considered that
side of the matter more than once and i
said so  but in heavens name i com-
pleted the admission  what could she
know

   too much haddon said in his at
times half-humorous fashion  why else
would they have tried to get her inside the
jail when she was already booked for the
mallory murder thats clear enough i
should fancy you see theyre afraid that
if she comes to trial she may loosen up and
the ivory pipe



tell things they cant afford to have dis-
closed

  he was right in theory at least what
he said would explain the attempt on miss
vances life  thats a logical conclusion
i agreed

 and haddon nodded suddenly once
more h  was smiling  see here he ex-
claimed  i wonder that you havent called
in that friend of yours who reads the stars
to help you a bit in this

   laughed it wras hard at times to tell
whether haddon was merely talking or ask-
ing a question  as a matter of fact i
replied  we have

  because really it couldnt do any harm to
tell him he knew semi-dual had twice
met him both times when semi himself was
engaged on the solution of a baffling tangle

  now he echoed my laugh  and what
does he say about it

   as nearly as i can interpret his re-
marks he says he will have to handle the
rest of the matter himself i rejoined

 eh haddon narrowed his eyes
 what does he mean by that

   he didnt explain i told him

    no i suppose not said my companion
in a tone of musing  honestly glace
mr semi-dual is the most wonderful man
i have ever met there is a something
about him-i hardly know how to express
it but a something that makes one feel that
he is just a bit wiser a bit stronger a bit
better armed with knowledge in its true
sense dont you know than any of the rest
of us im not inclined to be mawkish and
i dont intend to in the present instance
but positively one cant come long into con-
tact with him without feeling the mans
superior ability and force

  he laughed again and there was a tinge
of uncertainty about the sound-an almost
embarrassed something  i-well hang it
i always think of him as a wise man such
as one reads about at the risk of appear-
ing hackneyed i might allege that he ap-
pears more of a superman than a mere hu-
man being i suppose and yet-hes most
delightfully human does he still live on
the roof

   yes i answered nodding haddons
outburst was little short of surprising but

 understood i had felt the same way
about dual from the time i met him first

  he lifted his eyes toward the ceiling as
though he would pierce through the inter-
vening floors  sitting on the roof of a
modern sky-scraper reading the stars he
said  actually glace thats almost as
weird in its way as this case of yours

   i know it i agreed  but theres a
difference ive seen dual prove his ability
by results and so far as the case is con-
cerned the only lead we seemed to have has
flivvered and there isnt any proof

   of course said haddon  there are a
dozen different ways in wthich they might
have picked up one of edwardss cards

   i suppose so i assented without much
interest

   palls and this gregson are society
johnnies

   oh yes i said  of a class

   and the women at that funeral-they
were of a certain class of  society -im
using quotes for  society glace please no-
tice-too

   quite so i confessed  probably you
appreciate the class without further ampli-
fication

  haddon nodded  i fancy i do this
gregson is a pretty speedy johnnie i take
it and palls the sort of old-young bounder
weve both seen before

   yes i said  that about hits it off
but see here before we go any further with
this suppose i call in bryce

   by all means my caller assented and
i pressed a buzzer to summon jim from his
own room

chapter xxiv

the new element

he showed up a moment later shook
hands and proffered haddon one of
his black cigars which he declined

   too strong for my sensitive nerves mr
bryce he explained and i offered him a
cigarette i was rather fancy in my tobacco
because as a matter of fact i got most of it
from semi who used it very seldom but in-
dulged when he did in the most exquisite
blend i had ever found


all-story weekly

  haddon lighted the tiny roll and tasted
the smoke with appreciation

  i told him what it was and he nodded
with a smile  we were just discussing
mr dual and the case youve been working
on together he drew jim into the circle of
our conversation  and we were taking
gregson and palls to pieces in a rather
gossipy fashion before glace called you in
as a matter of fact im acquainted with
the woman in the case

   mallory said jim sharply

  haddon shook his head  no vance
do you suppose there would be a chance
of my seeing her now that im in the city
nice girl with a really exceptional voice
heard her sing more than once in new
york

   you could go down and ask johnson
hes got the police end of this on his ticket
jim suggested and asked a question in turn
 say haddon just what brings you to
town

  the eyes of the man before us did not
narrow in fact they did not alter at all
unless one looked clear down into their
liquid depths then and then only would
a close observer have possibly seen a tiny
change in their appearance for a moment
he looked neither at jim nor me but studied
rather the tip of his cigarette then be-
tween ourselves business my friends he
replied

   goin to be here long jim was noth-
ing at times if not direct

  haddon laughed in a wholly natural
fashion he spread his well-kept hands in
a little deprecating gesture  quien sabe
he said

   oh thats it jim nodded  nobody
knows-long or short accordin to what you
have to do eh its that sort of a case

   yes its ihat sort of a case haddon
agreed

   well all right jim accepted his state-
ment  my only reason for askin was that
weve worked on a thing together before
this and i thought maybe youd like to take
a hand in th present matter seein that
you know vance an shes caught in a
nasty mess

   oh but said haddon quickly  that
other affair was a government case my dear

fellow and glace tells me dual says he in-
tends to handle the rest of this matter him-
self id scarcely like to interfere with his
plans even to the extent of volunteering
any such assistance as i might give

   well bryce persisted  it wouldnt do
any harm for you to go up and see him if
he wanted to use you hed likely ask you to
get into the thing himself

  there was always a bulldog tenacity
about jim and now it appeared to me that
he was in the mood to grasp at any straw
that appeared to his mind as likely to offer
a chance of arriving at a successful issue to
the present case

   like to see him immensely haddon
returned lapsing into his almost drawling
manner  man i respect dont you know
immensely-most unusual type and all that
sort of thing interests one flicks the im-
agination-appears more like a character
out of a story book or something than one
in real life might be a magus or something
like that sitting around in those white-
and-purple robes he affects in his most re-
markable quarters what he fiddled with
his cigarette all the time he was talking and
watching him i saw the well-chiseled wings
of his nostrils twitch abruptly he changed
the subject  do you know id like to
meet this gregson and his running mate
from what you say they must be possessed
of means not to say rich

   oh yes i agreed  palls seems pros-
perous enough and gregson is the son of
old bill gregson who made a mint out of
the chemical importing trade i believe
haddon nodded  well probably ill
run against him im likely to be in town
some days fact is ive a lot of letters of
introduction to present ostensibly im not
working as of course you understand im
-well-just following my usual manner of
living still if i should bump into anything
in my poking around well probably get
together again one never knows what he
will meet either as for instance when i
called at miss vances this afternoon and
learned what had happened and came on to
ask if there were any objections before try-
ing to see her first

   none so far as we are concerned i
assured him
the ivory pipe



   thanks once more he lifted his eyes
toward the ceiling and then he dragged
them down and met my glance and smiled
in an almost whimsical way  jove i
wonder if there would be any chance of my
being welcomed by your singular friend on
the roof

  i laughed there was no denying that
duals personality seemed to have taken
an immense hold on haddons imagination
also i suspected that he was a trifle more
interested in the predicament of gladys
vance than he chose to admit which was
natural enough considering the obscure at-
mosphere of the whole affair and that any
one who spent his time in ferreting out blind
facts might find at least an impersonal in-
terest in the case

   if you really want to know i can
easily find out if he will make it a genuine
welcome i volunteered

 yes haddon elevated his eyebrows
 yes indeed i rose and approached
the box of the private line behind me i
called dual and told him haddon was in
my office

   send mr haddon up he replied with-
out a moments hesitation

  i hung up and turned around

   your welcomes waiting i said smil-
ingly

   eh he rose as i finished speaking
 well thats awfully good of you old
chap much obliged i think ill trot up
there for a minute see you again

  his stick in the crook of his elbow his
neatly folded top-coat over one arm he
opened the door of the private office and
walked out with a farewell gesture of his
hand

   and said bryce in comment after his
departure  youd swear he was a blither-
ing fool if you didnt know he was wise
now whats the answer m son

   answer i repeated  why he wants
to see semi-and-

   hes a slick article said jim  he
wants to see vance too you notice

   well thats natural enough isnt it
i countered  he knew her in new york
and went to call at her apartment and found
her in jail i consider it decent of him to
come to see us first

   yes i know jim admitted frowning
 but-

   but what i prompted

   nothin he told me almost shortly
and sat puffing away on his cigar the folds
of a puzzled frown upon his face

  i didnt press him for an explanation
whatever it was he had in mind it seemed
best to let him think it out besides it was
getting late close to the end of a rather
tiresome not to say disappointing day
which appeared to me to have climaxed in
semis incomprehensible declaration that
the future steps in bringing the mystery to
a solution would be taken by himself

  it was toward that statement rather than
haddons call my own fancy turned i
leaned back in my chair and lighted an-
other cigarette and tried to form even the
slightest the most vague conception of what
he possibly could mean

  the blue smoke of the fuming tobacco
curled around me it vas a special mixture
dual had once told me he obtained from
the same supply as the former khedive of
egypt egypt-i narrowted my eyes and
stared at the glowing tip of the cigarette
it was a tiny red spark in the dusk of the
november afternoon it was like a little
live ruby-or with the ash about it like a
little red eye in a gray-lidded socket

  egypt egypt was in the east and
dual had said there was a hint of the
orient about this tangle we had been trying
to unweave and there was the strange
story gladys vance told of the murder as
uncanny as any mystery of the orient in
its wording and there were the red roses
woven into a funeral pall for the woman
who had died-red roses scarlet roses-
and there was the weird the fiendish at-
tempt on the life of the girl in the prison
hospital ward to-day as the result and-
there was the ivory pipe and now dual
had said he was about to take the final
steps in person if i had rightly understood
him and here was i smoking an eastern
cigarette and trying to puzzle these things
out

dual had said too that gregson ar 
palls had none save an incidental connec-
tion with the case a feeling of something
like chagrin crept into my musing that i

should have attached so much importance
to the broker and his friend and yet-
even haddon-the finished the post-gradu-
ated government sleuth had seemed inter-
ested in the two men in question when i
had given him the facts

  i tried to draw a modicum of comfort
from that consideration as i sat there i
had been fooled of course but the trouble
was that everything had a trick in this in-
fernal business of as bryce now scowling
to himself over beyond my desk would
have said  seemin like what they aint
yes that was the trouble there were two
interpretations possible in nearly everything
that had up to now occurred there were
facts that couldnt be harmonized as it
seemed with the statements made about
them there were explanations offered
which might or might not explain and it
was hard as semi again had said to winnow
the true from the false to know which in-
terpretation to take

  all at once i smiled there was jim
puzzling his brain over haddons visit
which taken on its face was perfectly sim-
ple only haddon as my partner had re-
marked was like everything else we had
been meeting now for days not at all so
simple as he made it his business to seem-
a man who kept his very life and all that it
embraced masked as it were behind a con-
tinual disguise

  what the deuce  found myself thinking
had brought the man to town with a bunch
of letters of introduction in his pocket-
letters to be presented to society people no
doubt since the society dawdler the rich
and purposeless man of fashion was his
customary pose some thing important of
course i admitted the department did
not send men of his caliber out on any other
sort of case it would be something then
of a national or perhaps an international
nature he would attempt to unveil at least
in a measure inside the next few days
and on what of that nature i continued my
line of introspection could he work while
he led the life of a man whose chief em-
ployment was bound up in a round of calls
and teas

  with a feeling of amusement i realized
that i had wandered from my original line

  of thought and was now turning my atten-
tion to the identical consideration that
seemed to be still holding bryce i dragged
myself back and returned to the other
problem what did semi-dual mean by
saying he himself would handle the further
steps to be taken in the mallory case not
only that but why i tried to decide was it
essential that he handle things himself
admitting that there was a necessity as i
did not deny since he proclaimed it why in
the name of all that was reasonable did it
exist

  suddenly some hint of meaning seemed
to wake and quiver up within me if in-
deed there was a touch of the oriental in
the whole affair as appeared in the manner
of both the commission of the murder and
the second attempt at a crime surely dual
was best equipped to meet it with under-
standing he was half oriental himself
spoke persian and chinese as i was aware
read the literature of the two nations in the
original tongue surely then he should be
competent above all others to comprehend
the workings of the oriental mind was
that it and if so what in heavens name
did we face

  all at once and as if in answter to that
question another thought leaped into my
brain-as wild as weird as any other thing
in the whole affair and yet a thing which
if true might as it seemed on first inspec-
tion harmonize everything else-

   thats it said bryce speaking for the
first time in the past half-hour

  i started his words came almost as a
verbal confirmation of my own amazing
thought

   whats it i demanded turning toward
him

   haddon he announced

   oh is he i returned more calmly
for the moment i had forgotten what he
had been thinking about

  and yet his next words brought me up
standing  yep hes a slicker i got to
admit and ill hand it to him an i reckon
i wouldnt have spotted his game if i hadnt
had what you might call inside information
but-he came here after something an
even if i dont just see how i guess he got
it remember what dual said when we
the ivory pipe



was up there this afternoon well had-
don msons the answer hes th new
dement in this case

chapter xxv

speculation

for a long moment after his most sur-
prising statement i stared at bryce
it was almost as though he had voiced
in a way those most bewildering thoughts i
had just been considering myself if in-
deed norman haddon were the new element
semi-dual had said was about to enter the
situation then it might even be that the
duty which had brought the government
agent to the city and the mallory case
were one in support of such a possibility
i now recalled another remark of duals

  he had said that the interests involved
in the affair were great-of a vaster impor-
tance than any consideration of one indi-
viduals welfare of one individual life
taken in connection with jims suggestion
those words took on a new and different
meaning they excited speculation thoughts
of plot and counterplot of the intrigue and
adventure of secret diplomacy of interna-
tional dealings and complications i sup-
pose some of my emotions showed in my
face

  because all at once i became conscious
that bryce was smiling

   rather jolts you mson dont it he
said and then in mimicry of haddon him-
self  eh what lord he is a slicker aint
he but i bet i got his number he blows
in here hunting an earful after he finds out
something that connects whatever work hes
doing with th mallory girl and vance an
he gets into touch with dual just as he did
with us after he found we was workin on
th case

   gordon do you know whats happened
youve heard dual talk before now on what
he calls  interdirections an i savvy what
he means enough to know that its simply
his way of saying that what anybody does
affects somebody else than himself - that
this game of life is like a lot of intersectin
paths always crossin one another if you
get th notion an whats happened now

is that th path haddon was runnin out
an th one weve been followin for days
have crossed that about sums it up i
guess

  it was a long speech for jim and he
paused a little red in the face but with an
actual glitter of excitement that showed his
supreme interest and conviction in his eyes
more i was inclined to agree with him my-
self and i said so

  jim nodded

   you bet he declared and chuckled
 thats why he wants to see his dear friend
with the pretty voice so much my lord
that fellows slick an by th same token of
course he wants to meet bill gregson an
palls

   hold on i objected  dual says they
have only an indirect connection with the
matter

   its indirections im talkin about now
said bryce  even an indirection may be
a helpful sort of animal i guess i betcha
thats how semi knew haddon was due to
show you know how he works well--
didnt he tell us there was actors in this not
identified as yet th other day an dont you
suppose he was wise from th position of
some of them signs of his in his cart wheels
that somethin out of the ordinary was
cornin off

   good god jim i exclaimed rather
thickly  thats a most surprisingly clear
explanation for a man who pulls some of the
stuff you do about semis work

  he grinned he appeared very well sat-
isfied with his own deductions  well he
rejoined  i aint such a fool but what i
can see somethin whats just about dead
open an shut

   out of the mouths of babes and fools
wisdom i retorted

   meanin im which he countered

   meaning i told him as a fresh wave
of conviction seized me and swept me be-
fore it  that i think youre right

  he nodded once more grinning  even
you exhibit sense at times mson an with
them two teamin up on the trail of these
jaspers whoever they are you can look
for somethin to drop

  but if jim was right in his opinion there
was very little to support it beyond our be-


all-story weekly

lief and perforce we let it go at that for the
time

  edwards blew in the next morning and
mooned around for a good half-hour he
brought no information with him and of
course we had none to give actually i
felt sorry for the fellow he was positively
getting seedy in appearance his face was
drawn haggard and in need of a shave
there were dark hollows reminiscent of
sleepless nights and worry about his eyes
he was almost painfully on edge

  in lieu of anything else i questioned him
concerning gregsons visit on the previous
day to palls but he had nothing to add to
the fact the young man had simply driven
up in a high-powered roadster and entered
the brokers office he had remained the
best part of an hour and left

   but there is one thing i havent told
you edwards said all at once  you re-
member that woman who sat back of the
screen at the funeral the other day well
yesterday she drove up in her limousine and
sent in for palls just about the time he al-
ways leaves for lunch he came out and
got in with her and they drove away

   mrs lee i inquired wondering
whether the mere fact that the woman and
palls had probably kept a luncheon engage-
ment had any real bearing in the final
equation

   i dont know what her name is but i
know the woman by sight edwards re-
turned  dye know her

   i know her name and that she sent that
red pall to cover peachess casket i told
him  she lives out in the old wyndham
property and bryce and i saw her yester-
day afternoon in her own house

  edwards frowned  she sent em did
she glace i suppose im growing morbid
or something but im getting so i try to
see something that isnt there in everything
i happen to run across

  i nodded  thats natural under the
circumstances it seems to me i replied

  he got up and stood scowling across the
room before he abruptly burst out  good
god how long are we going to go on like
this how long has that girl got to rot in
their filthy jail i saw her yesterday after-
noon and i tell you theres something funny

about this whole works from first to last
she was pretty well over the effects of that
damned drug but some way she isnt her-
self and when i told her how hard we all
were working and how little we had accom-
plished really dye know what she said
she said i mustnt worry because she felt
sure everything would come out all right
 well i said  i should think youd
be glad she could say it you ought to be
glad she can feel like that about it

   i am of course he flared back sharp-
ly and then in an altered tone  but
glace it made me feel as though she knew
something the rest of us didnt-as though
-oh hang it i guess im nutty but the
way she said it and the way she looked
when she said it made me feel as if shed
been holding something back-had an ace
in the hole she would pull if she had to but
wasnt ready to use

  youd better go get some sleep if you
can i suggested because as he spoke i
suddenly found that i wanted to get rid of
the chap and think

  and he nodded  all right he ac-
cepted meekly  i guess maybe youre
right and im making a lot out of nothing
so-ill mosey off

  but i wasnt sure he was making some-
thing out of nothing as i watched him
vanish haddon had suggested an incom-
plete presentation of all the facts by miss
vance and now edwards who knew her
rather better than any other man as one
might suppose was advancing the same sup-
position and simmered down to the brief-
est terms that amounted simply to the
proposition that gladys vance might or
might not know something she would use
only as a last resort and to saxfe her own
life but what-what could she know and
why had she kept it if kept it she had to
herself-for what object to serve what
end i turned and twisted the thing this
way and that in my brain endeavoring to
find some plausible solution

  there might even in the present light be
something of what both haddon and ed-
wards suggested i thought in the girls as-
sertion the first day we called upon her in
her cell that whoever had stabbed noriene
mallory had expected some one else to open
the ivory pipe



the door and yet she had denied ac-
knowledge of an enemy who might have
sought to reach her in so unbelievable a
fashion almost as soon as she had voiced
the other assertion only now i wondered
if that denial had been an  evasion-if she
had sought to turn the matter off as a mere
suggested possibility if in other words she
had momentarily said too much and there-
after had tried to divert our attention from
it by making it appear a mere suggestion
rather than anything else

   duals assertion that miss mallory had
met her death through an error came now
also to appear in a different guise all at
once i began to feel as though i was seeing
light in the dark maze of the whole affair
dimly as though i were standing on the
threshold of heretofore undreamed things
as though it wrere possible after all that the
impossible might in some such fashion be
explained as though edwardss chance
words might have placed in my hand the
key to the whole unbelievable tragedy in
the rooms of gladys vance the night of the
victory ball and the upshot of my think-
ing was that i came to the decision that i
would call again on miss vance that after-
noon

   that decision i carried out

chapter xxvi

 you too

i found miss vance still in the hospital
but sitting up there was a current
magazine on her knee and a vase of what
looked like edwardss red roses on a tiny
iron stand at the side of her bed taken
all in all there was about her an atmosphere
of decided cheer

   she smiled as she saw- me coming and ex-
tended a hand  good afternoon mr
glace she greeted me as i paused and the
attendant brought me a chair  do you be-
lieve in numbers

    in numbers i returned  im afraid
youll have to be more explicit

   she nodded  ive had two surprises al-
ready to-day and your visit is the third

    and the other two i took the chair
supplied me and sat down

   a visit from a dear friend mr haddon
who tells me you are acquainted and the
statement from him that he knows the
strange friend of yours you were telling me
about the other day-the one who reads the
truth in the stars

   so you know haddon rather well i
inquired plainly the fellow had beaten
me in his visit to the jail oddly the
thought gave me a sudden desire to smile
there was a stealthy speed to the man both
in action and thought at all times that
seemed to contribute largely to the results
he gained

   oh yes miss vance told me quickly
 i knew him in new york before  came
to your city he has a really silly way of
talking but hes an awfully good sort

   as it happens i know exactly what his
 silly  way of talking covers miss vance
i said and looked straight into her blue-
gray eyes

  she uttered a short little low-pitched
laugh  hes really a very clever person
isnt he mr glace

   very i agreed it struck me she was
making conversation rather than according
me an opportunity to ask questions to
learn  miss vance just what made you
think that whoever rapped on your door
the other morning might have expected you
to open it yourself i sw-itched the sub-
ject under discussion rather abruptly

   why- the eyes i watched widened
and darkened swiftly  the fact that they
came to my rooms of course mr glace
she spoke with an almost surprised in-
nocence too as it seemed but  wasnt sat-
isfied  you had no other reason you
cant think of any one who would have
been likely to come to your rooms for such
a purpose

   no as i told you before i cant
think of a single person who would have
done such a thing as that mr glace
the form of her answer struck me  per-
haps not a single person miss vance i
said  but how about a group of per-
sons

   mr glace she cried out softly seem-
ing to stiffen a trifle and went on after that
first involuntary exclamation  wont you
please say exactly what you mean


all-story weekly

   yes miss vance i acceded to her
suggestion  i will for now it came to
me that i had surprised her that she had
not looked for the exact line of interroga-
tion my questions were taking and i did
not intend to lose the advantage of that sur-
prise  your intimation that your death
may have been intended the other morn-
ing gains strength from the fact of the
second attempt made inside the walls of this
very prison upon your life you must have
asked yourself and you can not expect that
i will not have asked myself why that at-
tempt was made and there is only one
answer which seems to cover the situation
that being that for some reason those who
made it wished by encompassing your
death to effectually close your mouth and
if that explanation is the right one then
there remains no supposition worthy of con-
sideration except that you must be pos-
sessed of certain knowledge in regard to
some person or group of persons which if
divulged would prove most inimical either
to their welfare or their plans

  for a long moment after i had finished
gladys vance did not speak nor did she
look at me directly rather she held her
eyes on the fabric of the silken negligee
she was wearing at which the fingers of
one of those graceful hands i had noted the
first morning in her own rooms were pick-
ing picking there was the attitude about
her of one debating a question trying to
reach a decision so for a time i sat in si-
lence and then i prompted her answer

   miss vance

  she threw up her head and met my
glance her own lids were narrowed
 that is a surprisingly logical deduction
mr glace

   and-what do you think about it i
continued to press her

   i think she said smiling all at once
 that joe edwards made no mistake when
he told me he had obtained the cleverest
local man of whom he knew to look out for
my interests in this case the police re-
gard me as a murderess because they found
me beside a dead body while you at the
worst appear to consider me no more than
an adventuress

  it was a somewhat skilful parry and yet

it was a parry none the less she was on
the defensive and i felt it and i didnt in-
tend to let her use either compliment or the
personal issue as a means to her escape

   you spoiled a very pretty speech in its
ending im afraid miss vance i told her
 and if the first part was sincere you
should give me credit for being able to dis-
count the last

  and like a beaten fencer all at once and
with most surprising swiftness she dropped
her point i do - honestly i do mr
glace she burst out with a quivering
mouth  and oh please believe me i do
appreciate all your efforts in my behalf
and-im going to tell you something i
ought not to tell you to prove it do you
know what is meant by the letters i s

   i s i repeated and sat there stupidly
looking back into her steady eyes  you-
too

   i too-you brute she said with a
tremulous laugh that made her words into a
most miserable pun and robbed them of all
hurt

  and for just an instant after that it
seemed to me that the hospital ward got up
on the legs of its little iron beds and began
to waltz slowly around i s stood for in-
telligence service and haddon was one of
the governments  unknown  agents and
this girl-this little singer-oh hang it-
the whole thing was plain enough now

   does edwards know i asked at
length

   no she shook her head  and you
mustnt tell him our value lies wholly in
our not being known mr glace you un-
derstand and ive told him all i could i
told him everything would come out all
right but i couldnt tell him why and of
course the poor boy couldnt be expected
to understand

  i nodded  i wont tell him i promised
 but-you do know something

  she smiled again as she answered  yes
mr glace

   what

  she shook her head still smiling  too
much and still not enough thats why i
sent for help and thats why i was so
sure after the first shock of my arrest and
the horror of its cause that help would be
the ivory pipe



sent and ive been waiting waiting for it
-only-it is sometimes hard to wait but
at the risk of seeming stubborn im going
to ask you not to urge me to tell you any-
thing else

   they sent you haddon i said

   yes and oh mr glace this friend
of yours must be a very very wonderful
man because when mr haddon saw him
yesterday afternoon he found that he had
learned the truth of what lies behind all this
miserable failure of mine to accomplish the
task i was set mr haddon says it is the
most remarkable thing he has ever met he
told me about it this morning and it seems
your friend had worked the whole thing out
he was even able to tell him things and sug-
gest others we did not know and had not
thought of ourselves and he-he sent me
a message by mr haddon it was so pe-
culiarly worded  tell the little toiler in
the workshop of the world that the inno-
cent find in their innocence an eternal
buckler when the sword of justice is un-
sheathed  

   yes that sounds like semi-dual i
said as she paused with a little caught-in
breath

   but who is he-who is he really mr
glace she leaned toward me there
was a strange awed something in her wide
eyes her parted lips the sound of her low-
ered voice

   the most remarkable man i have ever
known who knows the truth of life as i
have never found another who knows it and
worships justice and defends innocence
and respects and protects all pure women
whom because life comes to mankind
through themhe calls toilers in the work-
shop of the world miss vance i told her
as i rose

   i see she said  a toiler in the
workshop is a woman and a buckler is a
shield and the sword of justice is-

   just that miss vance when once it is
unsheathed

  and then i left her indeed i wanted
to leave her i had given her something to
think about and i had a lot to think about
myself and the biggest thing of all was
that as early as yesterday afternoon dual
had known had held the solution in his

    	a-s

hand-that haddon had gone to him and
found him with the key to the mystery in
his possession ready to turn it and unlock
whatever dark secrets it might conceal at
the appointed time

  yes dual had known and yet a certain
elation filled me as i turned back toward
the urania and walked along semi-dual
had solved the problem but-i hadnt done
so badly myself i had been on the right
track this afternoon and i had gained some
very definite knowledge concerning what
had been going on even if i didnt know the
exact nature of the thing miss vance had
as a government agent been fighting

   indeed i felt quite proud of myself as i
considered all sides of the question and
for that very reason i formed the plan of
visiting semis quarters on the roof it
wasnt often i could bring him anything one
could exactly denominate a surprise but
i fancied that he would hardly be looking
for the advance in understanding i had
gained this afternoon consequently when
i reached the urania i took an express
cage and went straight through to the
twentieth floor

  i climbed the bronze and marble stairs
i went up the garden path the chimes
rang out announcing my approach the
door of the tower opened and henri ap-
peared

   hello henri i accosted him in buoy-
ant fashion  semi inside

  but if i had come with the thought of
giving my strange friend a tiny surprise
at least i found the tables very effectively
turned inside the next breath for henri
answered

    the master is not here

    gone out has he i said that fact in
itself was unusual enough since dual rarely
left his own little self-created domain but
of course he did at times  when will he
return

  henri shook his head slightly and spread
his hands disclaiming knowledge by both
word and gesture

   i do not know mr glace he left
earlier in the afternoon on a mission of his
own devising he left word for you also
that should you seek to find him i was to
say that until you received positive direc-


all-story weekly

tions you were to think of him as one who
had abandoned the passive re for the
active in seeking after truth

chapter xxvii

dual disappears

for a moment i stood there looking
straight at henri in what i suppose
now was a stupid fashion and then i
turned and went back down the path and
across the annunciator plate with its chimes
beating out behind me and down the stairs
and i dont think i said a word i just
left him standing there at the tower door i
had come up here to carry a possible sur-
prise and i had been so greatly surprised
myself that just at first i think i was a
trifle dazed

  i caught a cage and went back to my
office and inside my private room and closed
the door then i rang for jim and when
he came in i told him what had occurred

   disappeared has he he remarked
rolling his cigar from one side of his mouth
to the other  well you should worry
seein as he said he was goin to handle the
rest of this himself an that he left word for
you to wait for definite directions he was
wise to somethin yesterday afternoon as
you must have noticed an after your talk
with vance to-day youll admit he an had-
dons got somethin pretty big on th string
i guess

 i nodded  oh yes haddon of
course to tell the truth i felt a little
jealous of the government agent just about
then

  and jim seemed to understand for he
grinned  federal  tec  on a department
assignment mson-an th new element in
th case as i pointed out to you yesterday
just before we shut up shop just the same
i bet that clever jasper is doin what semi-
dual tells him right now didnt th girl
as good as say it was dual handed out th
dope when they come together an if i
aint right-if he aint takin those steps he
talked about an haddon dont know it an
aint teamin with him-why has he dis-
appeared

i nodded again  all right jim i said

 your logic is sufficient i guess im a little
bit peeved

  bryce chuckled  sos johnson i saw
him about noon haddon went down there
to see gladys an said wed said he might
if johnson had no objections an you know
johnson met him - once an knew him
again so now hes clean up in the air an
he wanted me to tell him what was in the
wind an of course i couldnt an he
thought i was holdin out on him th boob
said he was goin up to see dual himself
this afternoon an- he broke off ab-
ruptly as a rap fell on the door

   come i called

  the door swung wide and jim went on
in what might have been the finish of his
interrupted sentence save that he made it
an exclamation  holy smoke-talk of the
devil

  inspector johnson stepped into the room
and closed the door behind him he faced
about ignoring jims sally  wheres this
man dual gone and whats he up to

   sit down johnson i said with a feel-
ing of amusement as i pictured his trip to
the roof and his rush back to our office i
waved him to a chair

  but he shook his head  dont stall
he retorted scowling  i went up there and
that man of his said he had  departed on a
mission of his own devising now whats
up theres something funny about this
whole damned business with this man had-
don showing up an spendin a hour with
the vance girl an duals blowing out all
of a sudden what is it come acrqss

   we dont know what it is jim told
him as he reached a blustering end  now
sit down if you want to or stand up if you
dont it aint more than fifteen minutes
since we learned dual was gone ourselves
 but he left you some word i reckon
johnson seemed impressed by his old run-
ning mates positive assertion

   he did said jim  he told us to
wait till we heard from him again thats
what henri told glace you dont want
to let little things excite you johnson its
bad for the health

  the inspector grunted but took the chair
at last  whats haddon got to do with
the business he inquired
the ivory pipe



   maybe youll find out when him and
dual get the thing cooked ready for serv-
ing jim responded  up to now he hasnt
exactly what you might call takeir us into
his confidence

   the fact is i added  that the thing
appears to have a far wider bearing than
appeared on its face at first dual hinted
at something of the sort though days ago
but didnt explain its nature	t

   and hes working it with haddon now
said johnson with a visibly quickened in-
terest

   thats the way it appears to us i
agreed

  jim nodded  yes he declared  an
if he is you can bet hes gone right to th
heart of th thing hes meanin to uncover
thats why hes found it advisable to dis-
appear

  disappear really seemed the very best
word to describe semis absence too dur-
ing the succeeding days so far as the
coming back of any word or sign to indi-
cate his existence he might never have
been haddon too was most noticeable
by his absence he didnt show up at the
office and johnson didnt see him and he
did not call at the jail again

  edwards was the only one of the inter-
ested parties who caught even a glimpse of
the fellow and that was purely due to the
fact that he still kept up a rather hopeless
watch on the movements of palls and greg-
son we hadnt called him off after duals
denial of any active participation on the
part of the two men mainly because to do
so would have entailed difficult explana-
tions consequently in so far as he could
compass it edwardss espionage of the
broker and his friend went on

  two days after our talk with johnson he
blew in and announced that gregson had
driven up to pallss place and gone inside
with a man corresponding to haddon in de-
scription of both appearance and dress he
didnt seem to attach much importance to
the information but said he brought it to
us for what it was worth as a matter of
fact edwards was rapidly reaching the
hopeless stage in his feelings over the whole
affair and viewed from his standpoint and
the little we had seemingly accomplished

it could have been nothing short of remark-
able had he done anything else

   quick work said jim however after
he had left  haddon said he wanted to
meet billy you remember and it looks like
he has an not only that but he seems to
have done it so darned well that billy takes
him down in his bus to see his good friend
palls uncle samuel knew what he was
doin when he gave that guy a job hes
the clear quill glace

  i know i agreed but dual said
those chaps connection was wholly inci-
dental and if they really are working this
together why in time is haddon wasting
effort on gregson

  why is a fish said jim water
would be cleaner without em maybe hes
playing billy for a sucker that guy d
play anybody for a sucker if he needed to
in his work ill betcha hes usin his so-
ciety racket on gregson to help him gather
dope

   possibly i accepted the suggestion
indeed it seemed a pretty good explana-
tion and i couldnt think of a better one
myself

  that was wednesday afternoon and
after that another three days dragged
by and brought the end of the week and
with it that most amazing end to the whole
affair of which it is so much easier to think
than to either write or speak

  saturday afternoon a messenger boy
brought to our office suite a sealed envelope
addressed to messrs glace and bryce
little dreaming what it might contain i
yet opened it at once

  the contents consisted of a half-page of
clear-cut legible writing

  will you kindly get into immediate touch with
inspector johnson and request him to hold a
squad-wagon in readiness with men for a call
between ten-thirty and half after eleven to-night
he will i am sure permit you both to accompany
him on the run when it occurs s d says these
are the directions you have been awaiting

n h

  s d says these are the directions you
have been awaiting n h

  for a moment i stood staring at the lines
 s d was semi-dual of course and
 n h was norman haddon and- i


all-story weekly

folded the sheet and reached for the buzzer
to summon bryce

  fifteen minutes later we faced johnson
inside the detectives room and the message
was in his hands he read it

   what the- he began to read it
again and then he looked up and met our
eyes and his lids were narrowed  do
you reckon this straight goods or a plant
he inquired	

   straight goods i replied without hesi-
tation  nobody but his man knew he
had left me a message couched in exactly
that fashion and henri wouldnt spill

   then well be ready for the finish of
this business whatever it is though i
reckon if anybody knew why theyd say
i was crazy johnson doubled up a fist
and hit his desk  i suppose youre going
to ride when the wagon starts as this sug-
gests

   well be on it or on its tail in a taxi
i informed him

  he nodded as though he understood my
feelings  all right be here about ten
we said we would and went back to the
office and discussed the note and fidgeted
around there wasnt any use trying to
do any consistent work with our minds
brimful of what must be coming off be-
tween half past ten and eleven-thirty that
night we went out and had dinner and
tried to kill time at a movie and were back
under the green lights in front of the station
on the first stroke of the clock we went in
and found johnson waiting a cigar be-
tween his teeth and his hat on the back of
his head he welcomed us with a grin

   well he made comment on our ar-
rival  at least nobody could accuse you
birds of not bein right on time

  jim countered with a remark about john-
sons being all dressed up and no place to
go as yet himself-and after that nobody
said much of anything that atmosphere
of just waiting for we dont know what
made the nerves of us all somewhat tense
bryce ignited a fresh cigar i lighted a
cigarette nine thirty came after a time
and ten oclock at last after that at
least another half-hour dragged itself away
before i looked at the clock and found it
ten thirty-five

  ten-forty

  the minutes passed on leaden feet
bryce was scowling as he smoked if one
only knew for what he was waiting it was
the uncertainty of it all that made the ten-
sion so intense i found a fresh cigarette
noting as i did so that johnsons cigar had
gone out and that instead of relighting it
he was chewing on the stub as he sat staring
at the telephone on his desk scoff as he
might at duals methods as opposed to
those of the police there could be no doubt
but he like jim and i in the present in-
stance was on edge

  ten forty-five-

  abruptly the telephone buzzed

  johnson caught it to him in a flash

   inspector johnson talkin he rumbled
in a voice gone a little thick with the strain
of the waiting

  and after that he held the receiver
crushed to his ear while a muffled voice
snapped and crackled and died within it
then  gotcha he cried and jammed
down the phone and sprang to his feet
jerking his hat from the back to the top of
his head  come on that was haddon
talkin were wanted at the wyndam
house

  the wyndham house the words re-
peated themselves as jim and i sprang up
and followed him toward the door the
wyndham house-the home of the woman
who had sent the pall of red roses to the
mallory funeral the week before we were
wanted there now haddon had said so-
and not for an instant did i doubt that in so
saying he had been no more than the
mouthpiece of semi-dual then-then-
semi-dual must be there at the present
moment-in the wyndham house and--
master of the situation the conviction
seized me as i took my seat in the wagon
with the men and johnson and bryce

   but its darned queer all the same
the inspector growled as the motor roared
and we were off  ive been throwing a lot
of feelers out in that janes direction ever
since i first heard about her and i havent
dragged in a thing th worst ive got
was that some of th swell push sort of
sniffed at th mention of her name an ad-
mitted they didnt care for her acquaint-
the ivory pipe



ance an against that she seems to be
pretty wetl in with a lot of society folks

   yes i said  i noticed that myself-
with society members of a certain class

   certain class johnson repeated and
suddenly broke off to resume with a deeper
more impressive manner by th lord
ive got it i reckon were going to th
place you was askin about th day of th
murder bryce

   what place said jim plainly he
hadnt caught the notion

   the place palls could take a girl like
peaches for a week-end party johnson
growled  yep - thats th answer
theyve been runnin a private hop joint
for that sort of no-account men and these
here society molls th place is secluded
enough an well out an theyve just been
doin what they pleased yep thats it by
the lord 

   johnson i exclaimed  youre right
for all at once i saw it marveled that i
had not seen it long ere this was sure of it
utterly convinced the lee woman had
been running very much such a place as
jim had suggested days ago in discussing
her morals after our call upon her plus as
as an added attraction an indulgence in
illegal drugs and gladys vance was a
government agent and had sent for help to
handle something she had not said what
and-she had known the nature of the thing
going on in the wyndham house of course
in a flash i saw the whole thing even as i
caught a gasping  my gawd  of compre-
hension from bryce

chapter xxviii

mene mene tekel upharsin

the wagon turned up the drive under
the arching branches of the leafless
trees and came to a throbbing stand
before the house

  at once as he clambered out the door
swung open and a man in evening dress
appeared

  it was haddon i knew him at a glance
even despite a most peculiar expression on
his face

   bring your men inside inspector he

said in oddly flat tones and drew back and
stood waiting until johnson had complied
then without another word but in the
manner of a man either badly shaken or
completely overawed he turned and led
the way up-stairs

  we trailed along save for the lighted
halls there was no sign of life about the
place that was the first thing outside
haddons manner i noted as we mounted
first one and then another flight of steps
and came out at the very top of the house
at last into what had once been the lounge
of a ball-room as i guessed

  there haddon halted us by a lifted hand
seen at close view under the brilliant light
which flooded the antechamber in which we
stood his skin held an unwonted pallor
and his eyes were surprisingly wide that
aspect of the man was more noticeable in
view of the fact that i had never before
beheld him shaken in poise

  he seemed to appreciate his own condi-
tion in a degree for all at once he spoke
for the second time since we had arrived
 gentlemen you will pardon my behavior
i trust i have to-night passed through
what is without doubt the most amazing
experience of my life and i am not exactly
myself but to the best of my ability i
am endeavoring to do what i have been
told

   just whats coming off here anyway
haddon johnson asked casting his eyes
about the apartment which was a wonder-
ful riot of color the predominating shades
of which were red and gold

  in an almost involuntary fashion the
federal agents eyes turned toward what
seemed a brazen door at the end of the
chamber  i am instructed to allow you
and messrs glace and bryce to see for
yourselves he said moving a step toward
it  you will leave your men here and
come with mejf you please

   hold on the inspector stayed him
 wheres all the people that run this
dump i didnt see a soul as we was corn-
in up

  haddon smiled rather oddly he reached
the door and laid his hand upon it  come
with me and you shall see he replied with
a flare of excitement  god man dont


all-story weekly

you understand everything was staged
for your arrival theyre-all of them-in
here

  and after that announcement there was
silence for a time i looked at bryce his
face was pale but stolid his expression that
of one set for anything that might come
his eyes met mine briefly and turned off
running around that unbelievably dec-
orated room with its gold its red its life-
sized sculpture of human figures in bronze
and marble some of them wonderful works
of beauty some of them out of all pro-
portion odd distorted shapes extended
into impossible lengths or squat lewdly
paunched and grotesquely weird its tapes-
tries of inconceivable labor its braziers of
burning incense the perfume of which hung
high against the ceiling in a slowly shifting
blue-gray nebulous cloud

  as jims eyes left mine there came upon
me something at least of what haddon
seemed to be feeling of the oddness of that
scene though heaven knows i didnt re-
alize what had led up to our coming at the
moment and then it merely struck me as a
most remarkable scene with johnson and
his men and bryce and me in that room
more like the reproduction of some page out
of the  arabian nights  than anything
else and haddon between us and the
brazen door just beyond his hand

  all that in a flash and then johnson
seemed to comprehend

   you boys stay here till youre called
he addressed his men who had huddled
themselves together and turned back to
haddon

  and haddon opened the brazen door

  we passed in and he let it close behind
us

  how to describe what we saw

  it was a great room in the former days
of the wyndham house the ball-room must
have been a beautiful place but now its
windows were deadened built in converted
each into a panel upon which had been
painted a picture so much i saw at a
glance and of those pictures the less said
the better they were wonderful in execu-
tion beyond that in any attempt at
description i shall not pass save to say
that the entire room had been redone into

an apartment in keeping with the wild
exotic erotic motive they set depending
wholly for its illumination on artificial
light

  at the farther end was a dais-a raised
platform supporting a table and two chairs
of what appeared to be gold and in them
were the woman of the wheaten hair the
mrs lee whom bryce and i had met and
the chinese butler the former a wonderful
vision of material beauty in her nearly nude
condition the latter most gorgeously
clothed a cap of gold and red sprinkled
with glinting jewels was on his head a
robe of wonderful workmanship incased his
slender form golden cases were upon his
fingers his dark eyes stared straight be-
fore him and his red lips leered

  his companion seemed no more than a
sinuous female shape incased in gems be-
tween the whorls and strands of which her
flesh gleamed white a jeweled cincture
supporting gem-incrusted breast-caps caught
her body about the chest a coruscating
girdle cinctured her supple length above
the hips jewels of wonderful luster
gleamed in her hair and in the bracelets and
armlets that clasped her creamy skin and
it seemed as though twin rubies had been
joined to form her lips

  and the rest of the room-that part
below the dais two rows of tables were
there stretching from it toward the door
tables such as one saw pictured or read of
in ancient stories provided with padded
couches for seats in lieu of chairs they
glittered with a wealth of service a blend-
ing of silver and glass and gold and porce-
lain such as i had never seen they
groaned beneath a load of costly viands and
flagons of tinted wines and the couches
were occupied-they supported couples
men and women caught as we entered in
the abandonment of that feast of appetite
and license in which they had gathered to
indulge in the space between the tables
there were others-only these were women
servitors some of them plainly by their
scanty garb and the dishes the flagons of
wine the fans of feathers others dancing
girls entertainers as one could see from
their garb the trappings of their lithe and
slender bodies shamelessly revealed
the ivory pipe



  back of the woman on the dais stood a
huge negro his extended arms supporting a
georgeous feather fan and midway of their
length and between the tables was a flaming
spot of red-or red and white-or no a
flower-a huge artificial poppy-a mon-
strous thing with wonderful silk petals and
in its golden center-the glowing figure of
a woman seated like some beautiful femin-
ine buddha-tables and couches all over
the place little tables of wonderful work-
manship gorgeous couches covered with
marvelous paddings and shimmering silken
shawls and coverlets and scarfs a wonder-
ful perfume mounting toward the gilded
beams that supported the roof in trailing
spirals of azure smoke from braziers fum-
ing slowly throughout that temple of illicit
pleasure that gorgeously appalling shrine
of material indulgence that unholiest of un-
holies into which we had passed

  and yet it was all like some dream of an
artists brush some fantastic and wonder-
fully executed picture because as i stood
there my breath caught in my throat the
blood as it seemed rushing back in a chok-
ing flood upon my heart incapable of
speech or movement robbed of every sense
as it appeared save that of sight in that
first moment of realization there was one
and only one figure in all that terribly
beautiful chamber of exalted sin that gave
any sign of life save him and him alone
not one of those before me caught as it
seemed in the spell of some subtle enchant-
ment either spoke or moved it was like
looking on some scene set forth with life-
sized figures done in the colors of life rather
than on life itself

  it was as though some spell had descend-
ed upon them binding each eternally fast in
his or her momentary pose

  for instance the jewel-sheathed woman
on the dais sat proudly disdainfully erect
the arms of the jet-black creature behind
her were stretched for the sweep of the fan
above her wonderfully coiffured head

  and what was that before the table at
which she sat for a moment i had
thought it a dog and not only it but several
of its fellows but now as i viewed them
more closely i saw they were men like any
of their fellows but men shaggy with some-

thing approaching an actual pelt on the
skin of their bodies their heads and even
up to the dark sockets of the eyes in each
aboriginal face men-servants past any
doubt as shown by the single loin-cloth
twisted about each shaggy waist

   circe and her swine god glace ive
heard of the stunt but i never saw any
one do it

   circe and her swine i knew it was
haddons voice beside me but i didnt an-
swer i couldnt his comparison was apt
enough too this scene was like enough
to the mythological story of the enchantress
and her dupes save that circe seemed to
have fallen to the selfsame spell that bound
these others all about her still it was not
a bad comparison it was really like it if
one considered it just a picture or it was
like-

  belshazzars feast

  the words flashed into my brain almost
as though spoken by an audible voice and
the single figure-i had noted as seemingly
unaffected by the arresting spell that
bound the others-the figure in splendid
robes and trappings wearing a turban upon
its head standing midway between the
dais and the huge red silken flower in
which gleamed the creamy form of the girl
like the very spirit of the poppy turned

  it turned and i saw its face without any
surprise as the face of the man who must
have wrought this amazing condition as
the face of the one man of whom  knew
who possessed the power to have done it-
as the face of semi-dual

  gold and purple were the robes that
clothed him from head to foot gold and
purple-the highest colors in the human
aura-the colors of purity and truth and
white was the turban above his brows in
the center of which gleamed an enormous
ruby that caught and fastened my eyes-
caught and fastened them held them
seemed to draw them to it

  slowly slowly one of the arms rose
stretched out extended in its gold and
purple folds he pointed

   behold

  his voice deep resonant compelling yet
as monotonous in its accents as the pulse
of the ocean heard at a distance as it beats


all-story weekly

upon its shores came to my ears in meas-
ured tones

  and as he spoke the heads of those at
the tables of the little spirit of the poppy
of the dancers sprawled on the floor of the
place between the tables of the hairy dog-
men-i knew now for the hairy ainu the
aborigines of yedo-of the servants the
huge negro on the dais with the fan turned
lifted and stared in the direction of his
pointing finger-stared and held staring
while as it seemed the words  mene
mene tekel upharsin i saw them-
and i knew jim and johnson saw them i
heard the former gasp and the other gurgle
deep in his throat and the heavier rasp of
their breathing

  the feast of belshazzar those words
-those same words had gleamed before the
eyes of the king in the midst of his pomp
and glory

  and then

  ye are weighed in the balance and
found wanting wo to him who is so
weighed and found wanting when the ap-
pointed hour calls him to an accounting
wo and again i say unto you wo came
the voice of semi-dual

chapter xxix

 awake

its sound was the sound of doom itself
it seemed to fill all the place to vibrate
from floor to roof it dominated the
sense of hearing as duals majestic figure
dominated that of sight beside me i heard
a gasp and haddon speaking

   my god what a power for one man to
possess when he told me he would do it
i doubted in spite of all i knew about him
but he did it i saw him do it he came
here days ago and hes been living in the
house i got in through gregson and i
knew something was due to happen when
he told me to send you tiiat note this after-
noon but i couldnt conceive of anything
quite like this he-they-they had him
slated as an eastern magician-the princi-
pal entertainer before they started their
hemp and opium orgy-and they called him
to do his stunt and after that-some way

or other-inside the wink of your eye hed
made them into puppets tilings absolutely
under the control of that terrible will of his
and then he told me to go down and call
you and wait till you arrived

  all that i heard dimly even managed to
answer by a nod and at the same time i
found myself in a most peculiar situation
for all the time i heard haddon speaking
and understood what he said i was seeing
those flaming letters on the wall at which
all the others stared with widened eyes and
faces gone underneath their rouge as
white as death indeed i was very much
like a man in the earlier stages of ether
anesthesia where he is still conscious that
the anesthetic is being given still capable
of a certain amount of volition yet begins
to experience also the hallucinations in-
duced by the state into which he is sinking
by degrees

  even so i knew that i was in a mildly
hypnotic state that those i saw before me
were completely beneath duals control
that he had employed mass hypnotism the
old eastern trick made use of by the fakirs
of the orient to cause their audience to see
a non-existent boy climb up an unsupported
rope which does not exist

  i had seen him do the same thing once
before consequently i knew now that
those letters of fire were not actually pres-
ent before my eyes although they ap-
peared very real and at the same time i
comprehended haddons words-how semi
had gained entrance to this house how he
must have come here and passed himself
off through his knowledge of the chinese
tongue and the ways of the orient as the
persian noble which on his fathers side
he really was

  i had known him to appear in the role
of prince abdul of teheran to gain the
ends of justice ere this and even in my
state of semihypnosia i knew he was doing
it now had sensed it in fact the moment
i saw him in his gold and purple robes
with the turban on his head and the im-
mense ruby gleaming out from its snowy
folds

  it takes time to explain all this but in
reality it passed through my brain in a
swift comprehensive flash and was pushed
the ivory pipe



aside as the man henri called the master
resumed his speaking

   wo unto you who are found wanting
to you who have made it your labor to soil
the spirits of your fellows through your
knowledge of the weakness of the flesh
who for your own selfish reasons have
made men into libertines and women into
harlots who have scoffed in the face of the
most high who created them in his image
and breathed into them the breath of his
spirit which is the life wo unto you and
thrice wo for the wage of your doing is
death

   wo and again wo unto you who have
harlcened to false teachings who have
wasted the days of the spirits pilgrimage
in a pandering to the weakness the appe-
tites the animal lusts of the flesh who has
crept night after night to the shrine of the
self-styled priestess of nirvana duped
tricked through your own frailty into
seeking unclean sensation the end of which
was the euthanasia the forgetfulness of
sensation by exhausted flesh

   wo to you men who rather than
fathers of children who should bless you
have become the fruitless partners of wo-
men who have sold their holy birthright for
a material mess of pottage wo unto you
women who have gone laughing into a
spiritual degradation against which save
for the blighting curse of this temple of
drunken indulgence you would have fought
with your latest breath for ye have been
drunk i say unto you drunk on wine
drunk on sensation of the eye the lip the
body drunk on the license exalted before
you into something beyond the reach of
others drunk on drugs

   and to preserve you still within her
power to assure your continuance as the
means of her parasitical living to guaran-
tee that you should still continue in your
false sense of enjoyment that she and her
consort might feed upon you while seeming
merely to feed with you this impure priest-
ess of yours has stopped not in striking an
even swifter blow at life wherefore i say
again to you behold

  the letters faded from the wall and left
it black as black as only absolute empti-
ness mai seem and then that blackness

quivered and other things appeared like
pictures on a screen

  there was a passage with doors on either
side i recognized it as the corridor of the
tosca it was empty utterly void and
empty save for a ceiling light but
abruptly there came into it figures-two
men and three women they came out of
the door of an elevator cage i found that
i knew them they were gregson and
palls dressed as a troubadour and the devil
there was red riding hood and a watteau
shepherdess and there was noriene mallory
herself they passed down the corridor
and entered a door

  again the screen was blank for an in-
stant before a different part of the corridor
appeared it was an end terminating in a
window and outside that window as i
watched a hairy face-the face of one of
the dog-men-appeared it stared up and
down the passage and drew back quickly

  abruptly the corridor seemed to turn
around i was looking the other way a
door opened and noriene mallory came out
she walked along the passage and entered
another door after what seemed a cursory
knock the corridor again reversed itself
the dog-man was again looking in through
the window for a time he clung so and
then clambered through the partly lifted
sash he was most surprisingly clothed in
a wonderfully embroidered robe in a flash
of understanding i comprehended that he
was so garbed because of the occasion when
the murder occurred just as i had known
for moments that i was looking on a men-
tally projected moving picture of noriene
mallorys death just as i knew others
there must know what it was they were
seeing since they had known the girl

  the murder had been done on the morn-
ing after the victory ball and the mur-
derer had been garbed to resemble one of
the attendants of that extravagant function
taken so his shaggy hairy face would have
passed to the most casual observer for a
most remarkable mask

  he made his way through the window
and came to the same door noriene mallory
had entered he fumbled under his robe
and drew a heavy knife and holding it
firmly in his hand he rapped


all-story weekly

  except for the hypnosis that held me i
think i should have cried aloud in that
instant for as he gripped his weapon i
caught one never-to-be-forgotten glimpse
of a sinewy hairy hand-of the same hand
i could have sworn i had seemed to see in
noriene mallorys room as i held the weap-
on used to compass her death in my grasp

  but i was incapable now of speech
locked chained like the others by the will
of semi-dual i stood and watched while
the door opened and showed peaches mal-
lorys figure watched while the weapon the
hairy man held flashed out and under her
arm and into her side while the girl reeled
backward and the knife was thrown after
her falling body and the door was closed
while the murderer turned and walked
rapidly to the turn of the corridor and along
the angling passage to the stairs about the
grille of the elevator shaft and went leisure-
ly down them pausing near the foot of the
last flight as the cage shot up with a load
then sauntering across the foyer and out

  and yet not to disappear save for an in-
stant to then reappear stripped of any ves-
tige of clothing standing with bowed head
before the man and woman on the dais
while they addressed him as one sensed
from the expressions of their faces the
movement of their lips and indeed from
his position and bearing in words of pas-
sionate rage and suddenly the woman
turned to the man beside her and spoke to
him and shrugged her shoulders and
laughed and the man nodded sprang to
his feet and struck a slender dagger into
the dog-mans breast after which his fel-
lows were called in and given the body and
they carried it out their faces contorted
by what appeared emotions of an angry
nature the body was taken outside as
the picture followed its progress and was
buried under a clump of trees behind the
house

  once more the whole scene changed it
showed the shop of a florist a limousine
stopped before it and a woman got out
she was the same woman as the priestess of
nirvana but now she was modishly dressed
and wearing an expensive sable coat that
hung nearly to her knees

  she entered the shop and engaged the

floristin conversation she moved about
the place after a time she paused where
a bundle of parcels seemingly wrapped for
delivery were piled upon the counter and
as she still talked to the florist she began
idly moving these about suddenly she
seemed seized by a determination she
spoke with an altered manner lost her in-
definite pose the florist hesitated briefly
excused himself and hurried toward the
rear of the shop swiftly then the avoman
drew from beneath her cloak a package
which she substituted deftly for one of those
on the desk concealing the one she had re-
moved

  she was still piling them about in idle
fashion when the florist returned and once
more addressed her seemingly his re-
marks were satisfactory for they appeared
to reach an agreement and the woman at
once returned to her car and was driven off

  again came duals voice

   those flowers were sprinkled with a
deadly powder they were meant to encom-
pass the death of a woman who had been in-
side this place of unholy pleasure whose
knowledge was a threat against it and all
who entered its unrighteous doors-the
same woman the man was sent to kill the
night of the victory ball-at the door of
whose room expecting her to answer the
summons of his rap he slew noriene mal-
lory one of your companions by mistake
and to insure their being sent to her cell at
the prison where she lay falsely charged
with murder those who sent them once
more prostituted the holiest of lifes emo-
tions made a sport of love itself and in-
cluded in their fatal package one of her
lovers cards these things they did to
protect their own nefarious traffic in order
that they might continue to prey upon you
and from you enrich themselves but now
i say unto you that the wages of sin is
death and again i say unto you  be-
hold 

  lie turned once more his arm rose and
pointed but to the dais now where the
gorgeously unclothed woman and her ori-
ental consort sat

   behold he cried again  the beauty
and the ending of the flesh

  and as he spoke the skin of the woman
the ivory pipe



shriveled the robes of the man grew tat-
tered and even more unbelievable still the
flesh of each fell away in putrescent fester-
ing masses and left each sitting there at
their splendid table a skeleton of bleeching
bones

   evil said semi-dual  is like a worm
which lurks in the heart of a flower to des-
troy its beauty evil destroys what it
touches like the worm in the flower the
evil in mens souls destroys and brings the
death of the spirit unless itself destroyed
behold i say unto you yet once more the
worm of evil feeding on the fairest things
of earth

  and now he pointed to the huge artificial
flower where suddenly a monstrous shape
a terrific sinuous body reared itself above
the petals and laid hold of the girl still
crouched within them-the little spirit of
poppy-to begin a voracious feeding on her
flesh

  the thing was dreadful beyond all
dreaming such a horror as may come upon
the opium user i have understood in
dreams when the drug turns upon its vic-
tim and rends him with terror rather than
fair hallucinations produces pains pangs
dreadful horror rather than a sense of well-
being and pleasurably thrilling nerves

  and then as quickly as it came it van-
ished and again dual was speaking

   it is finished and ye shall awaken
vhen i speak the word to speech and con-
scious understanding yet bringing back
with you to be remembered throughout the
span of your remaining lives the truth
which i have shown you in these things-
that it is in the flesh that death makes his
eternal lair and that only in the spirit may
life spread its exalting wings for such is
the plan of the divine wisdom of him
who created you men and women on
whom we call crying  om om and for
the third time  om 

   mr johnson

  beside me johnson answered hoarsely
 yes

   mr haddon

   here haddons response sounded in
a sobbing breath the spell that held me
was gone and i turned toward him his
face was chalklike in its pallor

   mr bryce

   here it seemed a sort of roll-call

   gordon my friend

   here dual i  i cried back with a swell-
ing heart because of hischoice of terms

   inspector you and the others remain
till this is finished you have posted your
men

   yes

   it is well said semi-dual  leave
them in the antechamber to this hall of
lecherous evil we approach the end

  and then his voice altered sank back to

                                                        

its monotonous tempo  and now once
more i say unto you-awake 

  a sigh a hoarse respiration ran through
the chamber of mentally chained bodies
and ended in a womans scream a crea-
ture little more than a girl lifted herself
from a silken couch and started running
blindly staggered a dozen steps and
dropped in a quivering huddle overcome
with the experience forced upon her too
far overwrought to effect her attempted
escape a man started up lifting a clenched
fist somewhere a woman sobbed

  that waking from the enforced enchant-
ment of duals induced hypnosis was like
the sudden breathing of overtight nerves
once more a phrase heard but never fully
understood came to my conscious percep-
tion in that phantasmagoria of horror he
had showed them they had been given a
glimpse of hell itself and now there fol-
lowed a wailing and gnashing of teeth im-
possible to describe as each smirched soul
among them sought to express itself

  until suddenly the nearly naked woman
on the dais lifted herself with a wonderful
flashing of jewels and cried something in a
language totally unknown to me but which
brought the dog-men to their feet with a
flashing of concealed knives from hidden
sheaths

  and having gained their attention she
lifted a slender arm that shimmered with
jewels upon it and pointed at dual

  in a flash i understood and my hand
sought the weapon in my pocket she was
setting her pack upon him bidding them
do him to death i gripped the butt of the
automatic and half dragged it out sensing
that johnson and bryce and haddon were


all-story weekly

arming themselves in similar fashion pre-
paring to throw themselves against the
hairy group of savage slaves

  but there was no need for our interven-
tion because swiftly with the snarl of
beasts the ainus flung themselves not on
the man standing before them with folded
arms but upon their mistress-the one who
cried them to the attack-and the gorgeous
figure at her side

  i know i cried out hoarsely i heard
men shout and women scream bryce
choked beside me and johnson started for-
ward a pace and paused

  for the scene was hopeless in its horror
of writhing shaggy bodies men and wo-
men had disappeared completely over-
borne lost so far as we could discern as a
fox may be caught and brought to earth
by a pack of throttling dogs

  and the dreadful thing was over almost
before we had sensed it the ainus drew
back their vengeance glutted and who
could say which among them had let out the
guilty lives of the ones they left behind
them inasmuch as they had done it with
their sinewy hairy hands

  as for the others in that splendid temple
of sin terror came swiftly down upon them
-the terror of impending doom they
sprang screaming cursing pleading to their
feet or sank down in impotent attitudes of
waiting they clung together gripping one
another with straining hands

   peace said dual as the aborigines
drew off  it is finished so does the
evil men serve turn upon and rend them
in the fulness of time it was their brother
who was slain i have seen his grave even
as i showed it to you it is the justice of
the flesh against injury to the flesh you
have seen exacted-the primal justice the
fate of those who draw the sword against
their fellow men for it is written that
those who draw the sword by the sword
shall they perish this thing was ordained
for them from the beginning when the
measure of their own misdeeds should be
full to overflowing hence i saw no reason
to raise my hand against the operation of
the law of retributive justice which in its
own time shall measure unto each what he
deserves

   and thats all they got

  without warning the spirit of poppy-
the girl in the heart of the scarlet flower-
sprang up and stood swaying a slender
shape upon her feet oddly too as she
spoke and moved she gathered the petals
about her veiled herself in their silken
folds and held them crushed against her
 she plotted the whole works with that
husband of hers fong lee just like you
showed it to us though how you knew it
yourself god knows

  dual turned toward her tore free a single
gigantic petal wrapped it about her and
swung her to the floor  how do you
know it to be the truth he questioned

   i heard her the woman panted  i
heard them talkin about it they were try-
in to get that other girl mallory brought
to this house she was a girl peaches was
tryin to get against the stuff on account of
another man but-she wouldnt use it
and they got suspicious of her after she was
gone

   and thats the gods truth into the
tempest of the human maelstrom rushed the
figure and voice of palls  she planned it
she tried to carry it out-and it was her-
her really damn her-that killed the girl
i loved i didnt know a thing about it
and neither did gregson until after the
second attempt on the other girls life
then gregson pinned her down and she
told him how she switched the flowers

   why-why it was her that called at
our office the morning after the murder
and picked up edwardss card and took it
with her without knowing and told us wed
have to be careful of him that one of her
men had seen him leave the tosca with the
police and the girl and a couple of others
and asked us to report to her anything he
did

   ah yes dual said slowly as the
broker came to a gasping pause  and
you told her about meeting him in the
florists shop

  yes i did palls nodded but i
didnt know what she meant doing until
after it all was over so help me god

   but you made a business of coming
here for these week-end orgies semi
pressed him
the ivory pipe



   yes i did that the man admitted
 but i didnt know of any plan for murder
i wouldnt have countenanced that and
neither would gregson the game wasnt
worth it we-

  duals voice interrupted him coldly
 you mean the traffic in drugs

  there were beads of moisture on pallss
forehead but he nodded  yes that was
all we had to do with it really gregson
got the stuff for them and-

   run right along out theyre waitin
for you bill inspector johnson was
speaking he was looking toward the form
of a man slipping stealthily along the wall
toward the anteroom door the form of
billy gregson whose father had built a
tremendous fortune by the wholesale import
of drugs

   you have lost the woman you loved
the woman you might have saved had
your manhood been of a different type
said semi-dual  there remains to you
george palls years in which to contem-
plate those truths in the seclusion of the
cell in which for a time you shall live

   mr johnson take into custody mr
gregson and his partner whose confession
we have just heard and this young woman
who is a material witness to the justice we
have seen done this night as it appears

  justice ah yes justice had been done
and having been done it was being not
only confirmed but explained suddenly
as i stood there everything was plain-the
task gladys vance had undertaken the
treachery of peaches mallory in reeking to
seduce the woman who would have be-
friended her if she could to a degrading
habit in order to discredit her with a man
she had failed to gain for herself the rea-
son why the little federal agent had sent
for help after she had been in this house
of shame and found she might not handle
the undertaking alone the mission of had-
don to run down and lay by the heels
those who were known to be infringing the
law against the illegal use of drugs the
motive which had led to the attempt on the
life of gladys vance and ended in the death
of one of their own number through the
mistakeof the ainu and his killing as a
punishment for his error to seal his mouth

to discipline and inspire fear in his fellows
poor slaves in a strange land where very few
save their masters understood their tongue

  oh yes it was all plain enough now as
plain as the reason why dual had found it
necessary to complete the matter by his
own efforts to enter this house and in per-
son seek the truth that justice might be
done as plain as the reason why haddon
had cultivated billy gregson and his friend
who as it appeared to me had in his at-
tempt to support the words of the girl now
wrapped in the scarlet petal once more
slipped and convicted billy gregson and
himself out of his own mouth

  all these things passed through my mind
as johnson advanced and gathered in his
men and the woman who went with him
head bowed as in a new-found shame trail-
ing her single garment about her naked
feet a modern magdalene

   but for gods sake what about the rest
of us a mans voice rose hoarsely above
the sobs of the women their half-hysterical
outcries the heavier mouthings of his fel-
lows as the brazen door shut the men and
the little scarlet shape from sight

   for you duals voice came calmly
still in answer  let us trust in gods
mercy some day peace as ye will it or re-
fuse it according to your future acts as
ye sow so shall ye reap atone if ye desire
it for the past inspector johnson will take
his place beside the door and as you leave
you will give him your true names what
disposal he shall make of them lies wholly
in his and the federal governments hands
but if ye will harken to my words yet a
little further eschew in the future the
slavery of the spirit to the body the
slavery of the body to such things as this
and all for which it stands he drew from
his garments the ivory pipe and held it
aloft  foreswear evil habits evil associa-
tion let the breath om breathed into your
bodies exalt them beyond this with ye i
have no further concern in so far as i
have any part in the matter-this is the
end

  he paused and sank into a chair while
johnson and haddon took their stand at
the door through which those who left must
pass

  and one by one the revelers approached
them-men with haggard faces women
seeking with tense and quivering hands to
clutch about them their gorgeous raiment
grown now into mantles of shame dancing
girls the little nymphs of latter-day life
gone silent their vapid chatterings hushed
whispering the fancy names of their calling
to johnson and haddon wide eyed

  so they passed-the last of the inmates
of that temple of euthanasia as i was yet
to learn the place had been called-and
passing left behind them the group of hairy
ainus and the giant black on the dais
kneeing beside the body of the false priest-
ess his mistress whom they had slain

   semi i said as the last of the guests
disappeared through the brazen door to-
ward the last i had drawn closer to him

  and as i spoke johnson approached
with haddon and the former added his
voice to mine jerking a hand at the ainus
and the negro

   what shall we do with them

  dual raised his head he had been sit-
ting with it supported on a hand  the

the

black is a half-wit let him be cared for
as for the others i think mr haddon will
see them deported he said  enough
i am weary my friends for days i have
compelled my spirit to tolerate what sick-
ened it filled it with loathing to accom-
plish a certain end and now that it is
accomplished i return to my abode

    but dual i stayed him as he rose
slowly and johnson turned away to bring
in some of his men and take the negro and
the ainus in charge  how about miss
vance we can hardly call this ended
until her position is disposed

   he looked me full in the eye and despite
the terrific strain he had been under and
the weariness it had induced he smiled

  for her is a new beginning i was
not forgetting he replied  hence when
a new dawn brings with it the hopes of a
new day you wid instruct edwards to call
for her at the prison and lead her forth
from its gates shriven of all suspicion her
former task accomplished to take up with
him her greater mission as a toiler in the
workshop of the world

jm bater was a tryer his worst
enemy would never have denied that
but in money matters he was hopeless
a dollar to him was essentially a thing to
spend ten dollars only meant that he
could spend a little faster when a hun-

dred came his way he merely lived at light-
ning pace for twenty-four hours if by
any chance the amount had been greater he
would probably have scorched the track so
to speak as he shot along

  and yet he was not vicious the fact

hp holt
taming of jim bater 



was that he knew no more about the value
of money than he did about the fourth
dimension while cash lasted he lived in
an impossible fairy-land and then came to
earth with what the cub reporter describes
so poetically as a dull sickening thud

  jim had done everything from working
an elevator in a manhattan hotel and mak-
ing a book on the race-course to gun-run-
ning in the solomons from pearling at new
guinea to presiding over a frisco faro lay-
out from peeling potatoes on a square-rigger
to practising as a dentist-home correspon-
dence school full course forty-five dollars-
in wyoming he was inherently honest
and that ought to have got him somewhere
but he never succeeded in putting a single
toe of either foot as far up as the second
rung on the ladder of success now gray
hairs were beginning to show over his tem-
ples at the age of thirty-four and he was
slowly coming to the conclusion that fine
linen and purple raiment were never meant
for him

  he was six feet tall in his socks strong
as an elephant and desperately in love with
barbara west she had no illusions about
jim he was one of the best fellows in the
world but the tide that is supposed to give
every man a lift toward fortune once in his
life had not yet come jim baters way

  there was perfect understanding between
barbara and jim on the subject they just
had to wait till he struck oil maybe some
day he would and then they would get
married if the oil didnt trickle through his
fingers before he had time to buy the license
meanwhile time was trickling on steadily
jim wrote to the girl dutifully from divers
places and barbara as dutifully replied
as a matter of fact she had more faith in
him than he had but that is the way of
women sometimes

  jims latest escapade had been nearly to
lose his life in a wreck off new guinea and
incidentally he went to an infinity of pains
on that occasion to drag through the surf a
passenger who had gone down twice and
never expected to cast eyes upon this wicked
world again the passenger when sepa-
rated from the water he had swallowed
produced a thin wallet peeled off a sodden
en-dollar bill with that extreme care which

is suggestive of near-poverty and offered
it to his rescuer jim rather than hurt the
mans feelings was going to accept it when
it occurred to him that parting with that
ten dollars might hurt the passengers feel-
ings more than the other thing

  you buy yourself a good feed with
that when you get the chance mate he
said whereupon the passenger with celerity
which seemed positively indelicate replaced
the bill in his wallet you see people of
jim baters kidney havent been sufficiently
hardened to accumulate wealth you may
think barbara was foolish to wait for such
a mortal but the man who has wrung the
price of limousines and a fifth avenue
mansion out of the rest of us isnt always
the easiest sort of person to live with

  in spite of her adoration for jim barbara
was an extremely practical-minded person
and when he casually mentioned in a letter
that he had been wrecked and almost
drowned that young lady awoke with a
jerk to a realization of one or two facts
and chief of those facts was the knowledge
that her jim alive was infinitely more
precious to her than twenty dead jims
would be

  whereupon barbara pointed out to him
in an epistle which was delivered months
later in sydney that it was about time he
ceased wandering over the face of the earth
in quest of elusive fortune settled down
instead to a commonplace job in his home
town and married her right away without
any more palaver

   we dont want to wait till were both
tottering with old age before we wed she
wrote  so just you come right back to
manster well get married at once and
your uncle says hell keep you busy

  this notion had a tremendous appeal for
jim the rolling stone begins to find that
rolling palls when it doesnt gather any
moss and jim surely was gathering noth-
ing but his gray hairs he never however
got away from the conviction-a conviction
which was sheer hallucination-that he only
lacked opportunity to make himself wealthy
it is an hallucination which he shared with
a good many folk only he had it rather
badly

  however jim peeled potatoes-in lieu


all-story weekly

of paying passage money because he was
financially embarrassed-all the way from
sydney to new york spent three-quarters
of his wages with angelic simplicity on
absurd presents for barbara and arrived in
manster with a smile fifty cents and a
light heart and manster killed the fatted
calf for jim bater not because the good
folk of his home town regarded him as a
prodigal exactly but because everybody
liked him and everybody was glad to hear
that he meant to stay this time not that
any one - except barbara west - really
believed he would stayfor any great length
of time

  meanwhile barbara let no grass grcfw
under his feet the date for the wedding was
fixed and jim went to work in his uncles
repair garage cleaning cars pumping gaso-
line and covering himself with grease his
uncle mr christopher white explained to
jim that if he stuck to his job and learned
the business thoroughly he would soon be
earning enough to keep his matrimonial ship
afloat comfortably and might eventually be
taken into partnership

  whereupon jim true to his own fantastic
notions immediately made suggestions for
enlarging the establishment on a colossal
scale as though income and capital expen-
diture had no relative value whatever
christopher white who knew jim merely
smiled kept his new assistant busy and
pursued the even tenor of his own way
and the days crept on until it was the eve
of jims wedding the knot vas to be tied
on the wednesday afternoon on the
tuesday evening christopher white ap-
peared at the house where his nephew was
rooming

   anything wrong uncle asked the
prospective bridegroom as soon as his eyes
alighted on mr white

   why no of course not not a thing
protested mr white emphatically and his
very emphasis was significant for chris-
topher white was ordinarily about as ex-
citable as a dyspeptic clam

  jim eyed his uncle queerly mr white
had two little hectic spots on his usually
colorless cheeks there was a distinctly
peculiar glint in his eye and a decided rest-
lessness in his manner  i just thought id

come round and talk last night youll be
a bachelor y know and all that

  now christopher white was the warmest
supporter of total abstinence that the united
states of america ever had so jim naturally
thought his uncle must be feverish he
was going to suggest a visit to a doctor
when mr white after coughing twice gave
an inkling of what was troubling him

  its an expensive proposition this matri-
mony jim he said

  jim smiled he always did when the
question of ways and means cropped up it
is possible to do that you know when you
are a bachelor healthy as an ox and pos-
sess two arms and legs

   i guess well get by he observed arily

  there was a pause christopher white
folded down a rebellious leaf on his cigar
struck a match and forgot to use it

   say jim he began afresh  ive
known you ever since you were the height
of a silk hat havent i what he did not
say was that he had as much affection for
jim as if he had been his own son

   why yes i suppose you have jim
was vaguely suspicious that some sort of a
lecture lay on the offing

   and ive known barbara west all her
life too havent i

  jim nodded

   i want to tell you right now his uncle
went on  that barbara has a better busi-
ness head than most of the successful men
in manster whereas there never was a man
or woman drew breath in this town who
knew less about handling money than you
do

  jim stiffened perceptibly  well he
said dryly

   now dont get mad remarked his
uncle  if i werent interested in you i
shouldnt go out of my way to talk like
this and-and-well im in a funny posi-
tion because there are some things i can
say and some i cant

   what i came here to-night for was to
make you promise that if ever you are well
off youll turn your money right over to
barbara because if you dont youll lose
it as sure as the lord put stars in the
heavens

   you mean hand her my wages
taming of jim bater



   no i wasnt thinking of that i mean
if ever you come into a big sum i want
you to give it into her care

   but protested jim  if i had capital
enough id double it in six months no i
wont bind myself with any promises

   then youll lose every cent snapped
christopher white  look here if some
one offered you a great pile of money-
more than you could even count if you kept
on all night-what would you do

  jim thought for a moment

   id drop dead he said at length

   but if you didnt drop dead

 i should probably take it jim grinned
pshaw exclaimed tlie other you
see what a child you are in such matters
wont you just do as i ask make me a
promise

   no because i might happen to make
good some day said jim easily  you
know id give barbara a square deal but if
ever i got the chance-

  at that moment a knock was heard at
the street door outside which a motor was
throbbing and a mans voice was heard
asking for mr james bater

   here i am said jim going to the head
of the stairs

   i want to see you privately said the
man

   then cme in suggested jim

  the man entered jims room he was a
businesslike looking person with keen eyes
and a snappy manner

   good evening mr white he said
nodding cheerfully  i wanted to see mr
bater alone but i guess you dont count as
you know all about it do i definitely
understand from you that this is the man i
want

  jim frowned

   what do you mean-want he asked
suspiciously

   this is jim bater all right replied
christopher white  now dont get ex-
cited jim nobedys going to bite you

  an expansive smile spread itself over the
face of the automobilist as he retired from
the room to his car and returned a few
moments later with a small steel box on
which were painted the letters p h
this he deposited on the table with an air

    	a-s

of importance while jim watched with grow-
ing curiosity the automobilist cleared his
throat and still beaming glanced round at
his audience of two

   my name is kirby and i am a lawyer
he began  to-morrow is the day on which
you are to enter upon the state of matri-
mony mr bater therefore according to
the last will and testament of peter hegan
this is the night when i have to present you
with a most remarkable gift-

   peter who asked jim

   peter hegan

   never heard of him jim declared
 sure there isnt any mistake

   where wej-e you on the afternoon of
january  last asked the lawyer

 why-why let me see now oh i was
nowhere near here that was the night i
was wrecked on the coast of new guinea
 precisely and do you now recollect
meeting peter hegan

   not a bit

   you pulled a man out of the water

   well

 exactly that was peter hegan
afterward he asked you where your home
town was and you told him

  jim leaned forward slightly and the puz-
zled frown on his forehead began to dis-
appear

   if thats so id forgotten it go ahead
im getting all het up

   mr hegan was a peculiar man the
lawyer went on  most peculiar in some
respects he had worked for many years
on the australian gold fields made a for-
tune and was then teld by the doctors that
he only had a few months to live he
wanted to see america again before he died
but he wouldnt have done that if you
hadnt pulled him out of the water

   however he had no relatives and as a
matter of fact he had no friends either
this is not hearsay but facts as he gave
them to me he admitted freely that he
had worked like a slave all his life and that
-well that generosity had never been his
chief characteristic he had absolutely no
one to leave his money to and as you had
taken the trouble to save him from drown-
ing he decided you had earned it

   he went to a specialist in new york


all-story weekly

who told him he was within a month of the
grave so he came on to manster and made
inquiries about you he found that you
were a tryer and that you wanted to marry
miss west he gave your uncle here a
vague idea of what his plan was but even
mr white has no idea of the size of peter
hegans fortune

   under the terms of the will-mr
hegan died a week after signing it-his
property was sold and converted into actual
money so that we should be able to surprise
you by handing it over in cash on the eve
of your wedding mr hegan planned all
this himself in round figures mr bater
the lawyer concluded producing a bunch of
keys  that steel box contains a million
dollars

    a what jim almost shouted

   a cold million repeated the man of
law inserting the key in the lock

  but the key did not fit and mr kirby
displayed signs of agitation he tried an-
other key with equal failure then grow-
ing still more agitated he tried to force a
key into the lock but gave it up wiped his
brow became extremely apologetic and ad-
mitted he must have brought the wrong key

   it is entirely my fault he said  the
other key must be in my office safe on
which there is a time-lock so i cannot re-
cover it before morning however the
money is here and that is the main thing
i will come from town in the car first thing
to-morrow with the right key

   and so said jim to his uncle after the
lawyer had gone  this is what you were
driving at eh

   yes lad now wont you be sensible
and hand that over to barbara

   jim bit his lip

   ive wanted a lump sum like that for
some time he said  ive got schemes in
my head before long ill double that mil-
lion-maybe multiply it by ten and ill
show you now that i do know how to look
after money he went on going over to-
ward a telephone he spoke into the
receiver

   hello there give me the police sta-
tion is that the chief hello chief this
is jim bater i want you to send a couple
of men up to my room immediately

theyre to stay here all night and ill give
them fifty dollars a piece for the job mfcn
about nine feet high if you have em no
no trouble just for protection thats all
send em right along gnight chief
much bliged

   id best put you two wise jim said to
the police officers when they arrived  so
that nothing can go wrong see that steel
box theres just one million dollars in
cash in it all youve got to do is to keep
both eyes glued on it till the bank opens in
the morning

  with events crowding one on the top of
another in this manner jim had no desire
to sleep and he spent the early part of the
night smoking and chatting with the two
policemen later he grew pensive he had
heard stories of buried treasure on a certain
island in the pacific this deluge of gold
would enable him to get up a mammoth
expedition he would have a huge army
digging up the whole island if necessary

  in these circumstances jim had the im-
plicit confidence of positive childhood in
himself also he thought of barbara and
the creature comforts he would be able to
buy her with a million dollars-with mil-
lions of dollars the night wore along until
the little clock on the mantel-shelf said the
morning was four hours old and then jim
dropped off to sleep sitting bolt upright in
his chair

  thus were two perfectly good policemen
left in charge of the steel box and a million
dollars sounded like quite a fortune to them
there are men in darkest new york who
can be hired for fifty dollars to do your
bidding even if you bid them kill and-
well they were not the first policemen who
suddenly found they had their price

  when jim awoke he found he was gagged
and trussed up to his chair so securely that
all he could do was to raise his eyebrows
and that was the condition in which his
uncle found him when he arrived not very
long after dawn in a few minutes the
wires were buzzing all round the country-
side but the two missing policemen had
vanished like ice in the noonday sun

  and never did a bridegroom enter upon
his wedding day with such a saddened
heart with bare fingers he could have


taming of jim bater



torn the two thieves to pieces had he but
laid hands on them his only consolation
lay in the fact that he had insisted on bar-
bara being kept in ignorance of his ava-
lanche of wealth until she had actually
married him christopher white fluttered
between anger and intense scorn

   bound to happen sooner or later he
spluttered when the hue and cry had been
thoroughly started  it isnt in you to
know what the power of money means
only you let some one get away with it even
quicker than i expected maybe now that
youve had your fingers properly burnt
youll take my advice next time you get
more than fifteen cents accumulated all at
one time

   oh im an idiot and i admit it jim
declared with a white face and the utmost
conviction  i ought to be kicked all the
way from here to honolulu and then kicked
back again you were right and i was
wrong the only thing was that they
trimmed me in the way i least expected it
 but they always do retorted his uncle
vehemently

  u well declared jim with a new light
of determination in his eye  i swear if
ever i get a bit of luck like that again-
he was interrupted by an automobile
pulling up with a jerk and a snort under
his window and mr kirby the lawyer
entered the house unceremoniously jim
listened to his footsteps with a glum face
and cast a sidelong glance at mr kirby
but he was too full of wo to speak

  the lawyer entered the room with a
somewhat abashed air in his arms he car-
ried a steel box the appearance of which at
first made jim leap out of his chair

   i thought that was the right key the
lawyer began  and it was but i made a
mistake there were two steel boxes exactly
alike each with peter hegans initials on it
they both stood on my desk after i
locked the money up in one of them my

clerk put one of the boxes back in the safe
but they were so much alike that he put the
wrong one away

   i owe you a thousand apologies but it
was partly mr hegans fault for bringing
me two boxes identical in appearance the
other only contains worthless securities
which we could not sell at any price see
the key fits this all right he went on lift-
ing the lid and displaying bundle after bun-
dle of bills a veritable sea of money  and
i hope mr bater you will forgive this
little-

   lock that up again jim was tower-
ing over the lawyer now his eyes ablaze
 jump into your car quick and drive like
the very devil to that yellow house at the
corner

  he had his great arms clutched round the
treasure chest nor did he relax the strain
on them until he was in the presence of the
girl who in another few hours was to be-
come his wife

   ive brought you your wedding present
from me he said stertorously  its-its
a million dollars barbara i-i kind of
lost it once early ithis morning but a
miracle brought it back id lose it again
and miracles dont strike twice in the same
place so-

   jim have you gone crazy the girl
asked

   yes im crazy about you barbara
he said relapsing into something of his old
easy-going self now that he had thrown off
his shoulders the awful responsibility

  barbara looked at the contents of the box
as jim opened it and then glanced at the
clock

   the bank is just opening she said with
a degree of calmness which astonished jim
 wed better go down and deposit this
immediately come along now jim
dont get so excited well have this where
its safe in a few minutes and then i want
you to tell me all about it dear

goddess of damned souls

i saw the whole thing i saw it from
the rather commonplace though i
admit unusually situated beginning to
the appalling catastrophe at the end i
saw it i beheld the slow change that
kilauea wrought i observed the break
the physical and mental collapse that
mme pele that volcano goddess of damned
souls forced up on my good friend harrison
rhodes-forced upon my practical-minded
hard-headed only fact-believing friend and
man of exact science professor harrison
rhodes volcanologist

  and yet seeing that change i did not
foresee the inevitable end of it all seeing
the approach of the breakdown i did
naught to avert it seeing that final piti-
fully horrible climax-i simply stood
stupified and with unseeing or perhaps
benumbed mind saw with my eyes-and
yet did nothing

  i see now that nothing could have been
done the thing was inevitable

  i did not cross to the islands with him
he took the lurline which landed him
directly at hilo so that he had only thirty
miles by automobile to land him at the
very crater itself so had he always been
-eager direct ever quick scented and on
jthe job

  i took the sugar boat manoa landed
at honolulu for a fortnight or more with
friends-and thence on the little mauna
kea leisurely traveled through the islands

mrsker jr

 the two hundred odd miles that separate
 these main cities of the hawaiians

   every minute of that passage was full
 of grace and color and strange interest to
 me-the pure sapphire of the snow-flecked
 water and the skimming dash of the flying
 fish on either side the tawny browns of
 the smooth sloping flanks of algaroba
 skirted molokai and lanaii the vari-green
 checkered cane fields on swiftly rising
 maui at lahaina the slender leaning coco-
 nut palms and low lying habitations crowd-
 ing so eagerly about the gleaming white
 staff from which glowed in the setting sun
 the good old  homy  stars and stripes a
 night of crystal clearness and constellations
 that hurt my eyes then morning and hilo
 and the drive through cane bananas
 guaves tree ferns-to the suddenly opened
 vista at the very edge of the volcano itself

   no wonder i forgot for those overflowing
 hours the errand on which i had come
 no wonder that there entered into my
 scene-drugged mind no foreboding thoughts
 no wonder as the full view of kilauea
 broke from the copse of ferns and ohelos
 on my left that for the moment only the
 thrill of another picture of startling new-
 ness and strange beauty came over me

   the fascination of the volcano-the fas-
 cination of it i say i did not at that
 moment comprehend

   but then i was surfeited with sight-
 seeing

   i turned to the chauffeur

    take me to the observation labora-
 tory i said


the volcanologist



  it was perhaps a hundred yards farther
and but a few steps from the craters rim
a long flat yellow frame structure mostly
of glass and wire screen it impressed me
and remarkably fitting its purpose a
japanese in starchy white bowed at the
doorway

   meestah whitcomb he queried with
great display of teeth

  i nodded and he hustled my bags away
i tipped my driver a portuguese and fol-
lowed 

   thees a way sah hissed the jap
and he lead me to the farthest room of the
building deposited my grips shot up the
blinds and with another grin swept aside
the curtain and said

   mos painstakin view iss not meestah
whitcomb

  i nodded at his rather remarkable adjec-
tive-another bit of the strange country
i mused then i started-for as i leaned
out of the window i found that it actually
overhung the great hollow beneath i
drew back with heart beating wildly and
palms pressing against the sill

  i caught the servant swiftly turning
away in pretense at putting away my
clothes-i saw the grin on his face

   whew i smiled  pretty deep right
here

  he turned

   four hundred eighty feets sah pro-
fess rhodes say an ovah there -he
pointed to the bluffs at the right- ovah
there professor say eight hundred-straight
jump

   whew i said again for i began to
feel a bit perspiry after that first glance
 under my feet

   floor ver strong said the jap  pro-
fessor rhodes smile when he see it he
added ambiguously

  then i recollected

   but where is professor rhodes i
asked quickly

  the jap shrugged his shoulders and
showed his prominent teeth again

   hajemaumau he said giving the na-
tive name-main crater sir study

   oh i said and took another look out
of the window  where is it-

  the japanese pointed straight out to

where in the basin that was beneath me
the shiny stove polish gray of the old lava
flows coned up to a smoking eminence a
short distance off

   oh-too far said the jap  couple
miles ver hard on shoe -and professor
rhodes be back lunch time

  two miles to the main fiery pit i
cried  just over there

  the little chap nodded

 air ver clean he explained  rock
ver hot an sharp where are break places
professor rhodes say me keep you here
where he come lunch time sah yes sah
i stayed

  so rhodes was already hard at it sci-
entific enthusiasm well let him study
id take my own time-unless he drove me
and harry rhodes had a way about him
that was driving too-a personal force that
impelled one to work as he willed and
when he willed and where and in what
manner that was one reason i liked the
man when  on the job as he used to
say poor chap he was  on the job  cold
hard matter of fact determined to win out
going at his work in an everything-else-
be-damned attitude that was simply in-
spiring all his life short but already full
of achievement he had sought and be-
lieved only in fact he had come here
to discover the facts about the volcano of
kilauea i believed he would not leave
until he had worked out these facts i
was not surprised that instead of lingering
here to greet me he was out there where
the smoke was rising after facts

  and already i began to feel that i too
must get out and to work

chapter ii

the pit of everlasting fire

  at noon i heard a stamping at the door
a and then in crisp hard tones but
full of friendly greeting

   hello old man mighty glad to see
you what a great time you must have
had no circles under your eyes plenty
of healthy color firm grip in your hand
quick movements head up great great
fit for work and youll have it by


all-story weekly

jinks man its a great study great study
youll have work lets get some food
in us and then well be off glad youre
so fit-need to be got heavy shoes

  there you are that was his way

  i grinned the jap began to fly about
like a white shade evidently he knew
rhodes pretty well after these few short
weeks i looked fine did i and so could
do work eh i suppose he would have
had the same enthusiasm over a piece of
machinery that came to him in good con-
dition

   thanks i said  i have

   youll need em he said  where
the surface lava is cracked its like broken
glass-is broken glass fact

  i smiled again fact

   your first trip rhodes snapped as
the jap served  well make a general
round-up broad view at first is better
did it myself later come details great
work-youll be mad over it i am already
in a little more than two weeks fact

  lord thought i he is going to lead me
a merry race

  and he did but how dearly was it won
and how appalling its finish had i
known then or felt-but that of course is
absurd how can one know that a thing
is to occur and then set about to avert it
to thwart the will of fate it is well
we have no vision of the future our
miseries are sufficient as they are god
knows

  but perhaps i sound pessimistic gloomy
i should not for after all it was a glorious
thing a splendid thing that rhodes did
at the finish-a thing that should in the
reflected glory it sheds on civilized man
make us who know and perhaps you who
read better whole-hearted more optimistic

  luncheon over old-clothes donned and
we started down into the crater by way
of a trail out in the precipitous wall below
the observatory and all the way down
and as we picked our way over the ancient
flows in the basin below rhodes in his
jerky matter-of-fact sentences was giving
me a general idea about the thing we were
to study

   whole groups of islands are volcanic
he snapped  bubbles blisters on earths

surface shoved above sea on this island
two bubbles mauna kea loas dead
more or less-kea this one still a bit
hot youll see that he added grimly
 damn hot

    and smelly i interpolated facetiously
 sulfur he snapped without a smile
 to continue kea rises up twelve thou-
sand feet-main crater on cone top dead
long ago-but this one broke out on the
mountains flank-like a boil big one
though kilauea is-see for yourself take
a lake the size of manhattan island and
let the bottom suddenly drop out of it
so that the banks fall straight down from
five hundred to eight hundred feet-let
the muddy bottom be a hard and shiny
slate gray and appear to have flowed or
be flowing in massy rounded molasseslike
rolls from a slightly raised place in the
crater-let steam be rising at odd intervals
about the muddy looking floor and a cloud
of blue sulfur fumes and whiter smoke be
blowing as from a great conflagration in
the hollow of the mounded crater-let a
mist be falling a strong breeze blowing
an all permeating odor combined of steam
laundry and match factory be ever in your
nostrils-let a feeling gradually grip you
that you are treading on a mined field
which may at any moment blow you to
atoms or crack open and drop you into
a sea of molten stone and living fire-let
your senses suddenly comprehend that this
is a work of living nature in the very act
of earth change and that over it man has
not the slightest control-and you have
kilauea god its magnificent

  we reached the bottom at last and began
to pick our way over the crackling crust
of brittle lava now and again a section
of the stuff would tip beneath my foot and
my heart wildly pound

  but rhodes would exclaim

   no worries old man nothing hot
right here hells a bit further on

  yet a hundred paces along he stopped
and pointed to a bit of steam trailing in
the breeze from alow break in the floor

   stuff flowing there he said matter-
of-factly

  i craned my neck and started for the
place
the volcanologist



  approach it from below cried
 rhodes

    but it will run right at me then i
 remonstrated

    you can dodge these little fellows but
 if you get above you might break through
 the crust and lose a foot before you knew
 it was burned native did that a month
 ago-unpleasant they say

    a little coldness seized me

    you mean that above us here under
 the crackly stuff on which were treading
 the liquid molten rock is lying

   he nodded

    fact he said  theres the main
 fiery pit- he pointed ahead a mile or
 so to where the rise was craggily cut off and
 smoke was rising  natives call it the
 pit of everlasting fire halemaumau

  theyve names for everything here you
 know-queer ducks well up in there the
 lava level must be a hundred yards or more
 higher than we are here only the hard-
 ened crust around the pit holds it from
 getting us right now-from getting the
 whole country i might just as well say
 why if the thing took a notion to rise
 it could flood half the island and destroy
 -ugh i dont like to think of that-with
 nothing nothing you know to stop it-
 beyond mans power  huh he smiled
 belittlingly at the thought of man  huh
 little shrimp-man-insignificant atom
 i smiled my appreciation

    but this little tongue of lava breaking
 out right here i hinted

     well there are weak places of course
 rhodes went on  and of course the
 pressure of all that stuff above in the pit
 is terrific so naturally some of it leaks
 through-creeps between old flows you
 know-under enormous pressure see
 he pointed at a little glowing tongue that
 suddenly streamed from under the crust
 to our left  theres a bit forced out
 but see it turn gray-hardened almost at
 once watch it now-and youll see the
 hardened tip lift a little and out the molten
 stuff will run again

   it so happened and weirdly enough
 then the surface of that tiny flow hard-
 ened we waited a few moments then as
 before the tip of this last flow raised ever

so little and out was forced another fiery
trickle

  i gasped

   its alive  i exclaimed

  rhodes smiled mockingly

   yes the natives say that they have
legends you know superstitious rot 

   but do these little flows take place
throughout all the older stuff i queried

  he nodded

   they are continually raising the bot-
tom of the crater it may be that the
very spot you stand on will to-morrow be
covered a couple feet-

  i jumped

   lets move on i said  the stuff
is alive

   youre as bad as the kanakas smiled
rhodes  remember youre here to get
facts not to go batty over a bit of hot
stone being alive

   i dont blame em i grunted as we
turned aside to clear another tricklet of
smoking glowy stuff that seemed to hur-i
riedly run out to meet us

    who said rhodes

   the natives i answered

  then rhodes stated another fact

   youre a fool he snapped and strode
on

  submissively i followed

  but i smiled within myself harrison
rhodes volcanologist said i to myself will
let nothing prevent him from getting the
facts about kilauea and nothing i added
soberly can prevent him from learning all
that mere humans might learn

  there is always a place admittedly
where man comes against a wall a vast
wall opaque impenetrable unsurmount-
able against which he may fling himself
until exhausted and yet which still stub-
bornly sphinxlike will answer his questions
-not i felt that rhodes would glean
all he could all man could until he
reached this wall then fr the man was
built that way he would scan the wall
from afar measure it with wisdoms eye
close up to it and minutely search every
detail then because he wanted fact and
only fact he would say  i have come to
the end of my labors there is nothing
farther that i can pick apart and set aside


all-story weekly

and say this is fact therefore my
good friend let us pack up our notes our
photographs our paraphernalia and hie us
back to the good old coast where we can
at leisure write the book the university so
madly craves-a book of facts then he
might add for he differed not from the
rest of our kind  let some fool old
graybeard there theorize-well get the
facts

  again i smiled to myself as i slipped
and stumbled over the crackling surface
rhodes was practicality itself-i a fool

  yet i argued i was right where i said
that i didnt blame the natives for their
superstition that vast wall against which
we would finally come was simply one of a
series an infinite series the wall against
which the kanakas came was simply one
earlier in the series we had solved the
open sesame to its mystery had penetrated
it and trod the ground betwixt it and that
wall that finally would defeat us with
eagerness certainty wisdom to them
what lay beyond the wall at which their
knowledge of fact ended was blackness
mystery gods-to us because we were
secure in deeper sight this blackness
mystery and talk of gods was superstition
they did not conceive perhaps of other
walls beyond our wall to them all that
could possibly be beyond theirs was black-
ness mystery gods-but to us what lay
beyond our wall we smugly said was yet
unsolved nature and we let our graybeards
build fanciful theories the natives con-
jured up ghosts and gods and pulled off
each others heads to prove a favorites
peculiar powers the graybeards conjec-
tured over heat and pressures and plucked
each others whiskers to prove their own
particular principles

  a difference not of kind but of degree

  and even rhodes had said that we were
to note fact and fact only

   well said i to myself as we puffed
up the steeper slope to the main fiery pit
 just what will he do when he comes to
his wall he said all he wanted was fact
-let the philosophers at the university
theorize as i looked about me at the
vastness of the arena of steaming heat to
the center of which we little atoms walked

so boldly confident i wondered if rhodes
would hold to his word just get facts-or
would he then try to go beyond and
if he tried to penetrate his wall-what
then

  perhaps it is fortunate that man has not
the gift of prescience i am glad with such
thought running through my mind that i
had not

  as we slipped and crunched upward a
deep gurgling and heavy puffing struck my
ear and at the same time came a shrill
chorus of excited voices a half dozen
tourists at the pits brink beckoned to us
to hurry

  we leaped on and in a moment more
stood with them

chapter iii

mme peles hair

there are two visions of halemaumau
that i will ever carry with me-and
would that they were but one the
first view i had of the fiery pit is one the
last view is the other the first a vista of
wierd thrilling fascination the last-of
hellish horror god had i but dreamed it
had i but-but the thing is done and
naught is left but to tell it-naught but to
tell it all

  my first impression was of craggy
jagged out-reaching jaws a wide opened
mouth of heated-hazed gray and livid red
a leaping pulsing eager tongue in the very
center-madly opened wide and spewing
at the heavens and in a sobbing thwarted
voice cursing god-a thing in and of itself
alive terrible malevolent

  my second impression-i turned to
rhodes

 a bit of hell itself i muttered

  there was no answer

  rhodes hands behind his back was gaz-
ing fascinatedly at the leaping turmoil of
lava in the swirling pool of molten rock
at our feet his face was tense his eyes
burning with a heat that was second only
to the crater itself i thrilled a bit-if
i could only feel in myself but a portion
of his scientific ardor

  i nudged him
the volcanologist



   as if beneath that pool i said  softie
monster ogre was chained in everlasting
torment his writhings causing those slow
currents beneath the cliffs his choking
breath the convulsive leaping of the molten
lava his desperate sobbing the grumbling
of the stuff and the trembling of the rock
beneath our feet

  rhodes jerked awake

   perhaps there is he said in a low
voice

  for a fraction of a second i took my eyes
off the pit of fire this much from rhodes
--even in fun

   well i said  that is a concession to
native superstition and -i could not help
but add- to a fool

  a bit irritable i fancied my good friend
shook himself

  every day for almost three weeks past
he said  three hours each day i have
watched the scene before us i have seen
the whole pool silent heavy gray surfaced
and wrinkled slightly-as elephant hide in
tough appearance as a pot of molten lead
in color and calmly latent possibilities-
gray placid but hot only at the edges
beneath the cliffs continually and redly
lapping lapping lapping hungry for the
rock on which it feeds

   and then in a moment a split appears
great sections of the congealed surface
swing apart the red molten stuff beneath
touching the air leaps and hisses and bel-
lows the whole pit becomes alive great
blocks of the cliffs slide in leap in eagerly
throw themselves in-and the place does
become even as the natives call it hale-
maumau the pit of everlasting fire
three weeks of it ive seen and the
natives sacrifice to it here his face hard-
ened and his hands clenched  fools
as if man- then he shrugged his shoul-
ders again and stared to the left where
the gray hardened surface was slowly en-
tering a glaring puffing hollow beneath the
cliff-and disappearing in its maw

  then suddenly rhodes chuckled

   look at em he said nodding to the
tourists who had made their way to a low
level of hardened lava to our right  that
is what i call practical-broiling ham over
a crack in the surface

   what i exclaimed

   not possible he ran on  look be-
neath you

  i did and confess to another real thrill
for hot three feet below the surface the
fissure in the lava was glaring red i
stepped aside a bit hastily-nearer to the
craters edge

  rhodes chuckled again-then his face
went white-and tightened in horror

   this way he cried hoarsely  jump
jump

  needless to say i leaped straight over the
red hot crack that i had just avoided
rhodes still white and tense seized my
arm and ran me a dozen paces to one side
and as we scrambled on a rending crash
came from behind us a giant plopping splash
followed

  and when i turned to look the entire
ledge on which we had been standing had
disappeared and the pool of molten rock
was in turmoil my knees weakly de-
posited me onto the ground and my head
swam

  rhodess hand trembled as he sitting
also and breathing heavily placed it on
my shoulder his smile was rather forced
i imagine when he said

   well old man your torturecf ogre
nearly got you that time didnt he

  i nodded quietly jerkily

   not a pleasant way of going i im-
agine he ran on a little smoother  i
never did fancy so hot an end rather
glad we noticed the ham broilers-

  i looked up a bit anxiously

   oh they never even heard it he said
 but if they hadnt been playing there
i might not have looked at the crack be-
neath our feet might not have seen it
slowly widen might not have jumped with
you in time you see tourist boasting- i
did it too-over a crack -probably saved
us from a rather unpleasant end

  i pressed his hand

  its not a joke i murmured
 thanks

  he grinned but returned the pressure

   no joke-fact but it did almost get
you- beware what you say of kilauea
now lets go over to the second crater
three little ones now you know he

hurried on seemingly quite over his emo-
tion  all the stuff in sight even the crust
were standing on is new flow of the last
four months-used to be one great pit
now three-fact

  so was the man changed again  fact
fact fact-he adored fact and yet-there
was that on his face as he stared at the
lapping fiery rock that seemed to say

   yes this whole thing is a single great
fact it is it exists it is fact but behind
it all-well i do wonder now what is hid-
den there something-it fascinates-fas-
cinates that is what his face his glow-
ing eyes had seemed to say and recalling
i wondered if something were changing in
the basic character of my good friend
harrison rhodes volcanologist whether
after all he were not wondering what lay
beyond his wall-whether after all he was
charmed only by-fact

  the days passed we photographed took
notes tested for temperature for the chem-
istry of the lava the fumes the steam
we observed by day by night-recorded
the movement of the flows the varying
heights which the pools in the crater cal-
drons reached the coincident amounts of
vapor and smoke and seismic action

  rhodes was incessantly  on the job
he never wearied he never seemed to
fear he was obsessed with scientific
fervor he must have facts he took
chances risked horrible death a dozen times
a day laughed when i remonstrated when
i recalled to him our narrow escape of my
first day at the crater-boasted that noth-
ing could get him-and on it all waxed fat

  then one day came a package of beoks
from honolulu i was glad for i antici-
pated an evening of enjoyment

  but before i had a chance to mention
the thing to him rhodes had azaki carry
it into his bedroom unopened he did this
almost secretively as though he thought
that i might see the books-and laugh

  i wondered at this-for we shared all
our pleasures and difficulties together even
as we had done when students in the uni-
versity for which we now labored

  i wondered too as each day we made
our observations at the fiery pit of hale-

maumau why rhodes had at times those
fits of seeming abstraction why he would
stand and gaze so fascinatedly at the teem-
ing stuff within-stand thus when our notes
of that particular formation or phenomenon
were already quite complete

  he would watch the stuff as the surface
spiraled about as the gray sections of it
would tip and up-endedly slide the one be-
neath the other as great chunks of cliff
would thunderingly fall into the lava with
a ponderous splashing and upheaval of the
heavy liquid as fountains of liquid fire
would dance with clumsy grace and fan-
tasy-would watch it as though dazed by
its vastness as though hypnotized by its
constant variation

  -then one day as we were taking motion
pictures of a particularly beautiful play
of lava i saw his eyes eagerly scanning the
formation on which he stood and sud-
denly he stepped closer to the crater
stooped and scooped up something from
the ground

  he held out his hand to me one finger
bleeding plentifully-and in the palm was
a fluffy bit of hairlike material soft as
spun glass and really the same stuff spun
by the winds playing on the spurting lava

   peles hair he said with a smile

  i nodded

  yes i said  another pretty native
superstition and youve cut yourself on
the sharp lava break-thats a blood sac-
rifice for the hair i should say eh

  he shrugged his shoulders and turned
away i watched him from the tail of my
eye he did not toss the soft stuff to the
winds but surreptitiously stowed it in an
envelope playing with me eh i smiled
to myself or seized wth a sudden taste
for curio-saving or-what else might it
be

  why this growing secrecy-if indeed it
were secrecy at all

  that night i found one of the new books
on the spreading porch where he had un-
doubtedly forgotten it i picked it up and
read the title

  it was  native hawaiian supersti-
tions the author i have forgotten

  i laid it in my hand and it opened
naturally and easily at a chapter labeled
the volcanologist



 legends of kilauea and a little further
along came the story of mme pele the
goddess of fire and of native sacrificial
feasts in her honor on the craters crumbling
edge

  so that was what rhodes was reading
i had heard of such books i knew the
kanakas had such tales such folk-lore
rhodes knew that i knew this too then
why i pondered this secretiveness why
did he not share the books with me was
it perhaps that he didnt- wish to distract
me from the work at hand-gathering
facts was it that he knew it was utter
nonsense and so was a little ashamed that
i find him immersed in such literature after
all his outbursts regarding his obsession
for the pursuit of fact and his mocking of
those who halted at their wall according
to their lights conjure up spirits or conjec-
ture as to principles

  or was it something else

  why had he been so fascinated to-day
in that little tangle of mme peles hair
when the stuff was in every nook and
cranny near the crater and we had seen it
every visit we had made

  why were his observations of the changes
in the pit made now with so much more
of the fanatic than the cool hard-headed
practical-minded only-fact-believing man
of exact science that heretofore he had
been

  why had he not accepted my little joke
about blood sacrifice when i noticed his
finger bleed from the cut made by the
newly broken lava edge

  he hadnt he hadnt even smiled he
had simply turned away and tucked that
bit of volcanic spun glass in his pocket

 and that evening when he came in i
having left the crater earlier in the day
in order to develop some film in which i
was particularly interested i mentioned
jokingly testingly i had better say these
books

  it was natural for me to do this too
for no sooner was the dinner over and our
cigars lit than he started for his own
room

  as his hand touched the door knob i
opened the question

   pretty interesting stuff for a practical

man whose business it is to set down fact
i hinted

  he paused-his face a study

   you mean--have seen- he then said
a bit hotly chin lifted

   i didnt spy harry old man i said
 but why the secrecy-why all the-

  he closed the door and dropped into a
seat at my side whence through the great
glass windows he could view the fast dim-
ming crater he seemed to be pondering
over just how to explain himself and put
his action into the right light his cigar
smoke drifted idly for several minutes be-
fore he spoke and finally when he did
vouchsafe a further answer his voice was
calm but his words uncertain as if he him-
self were not sure of himself were not
quite clear in his own mind

   i dont know he said  i confess
it-i dont know why i did it i sent
for the books on-well on impulse and
i found when they came at last that i was
a bit fussed you know-wondering what
you would say

  i raised my brows

   was there any reason why i shouldnt
think it quite natural that you read that
type of book-dealing with the subject
that is our present study-even though
only native superstition

  he glanced at me-and i read surprise
in his quick eye and a little mortification
as well 

   well he said slowly  you know i
detest fanciful-

   yes i interrupted quickly  you did
detest such stuff

  at that his face hardened slightly then
he said shortly

   the things interest me-rest me and
it is possible is it not that even native
folk-lore may shed some light on ancient
volcanic phenomena here legends origi-
nate in something - some physical con-
crete action or object of nature do they
not

  i had to acknowledge that they did but
nevertheless i could see clearly enough
from his talk his actions the suspicious and
furtive look in his eye that he had hidden
these books from me for more reason than
he would acknowledge and as i sat and


all-story weekly

the blue smoke of my cigar mingled in
the ensuing silence with that from his i
saw him again as he stood a few days before
in rapt fascination on the craters edge-
i saw again the strange look that was on
him as he held up that suddenly plucked
fluff of mme peles hair

  the first days of my stay with him he
had not acted thus why did he now

  surely tourists enough had i seen gaz-
ing enraptured even dazed into the seeth-
ing glowing crater their eyes reflecting the
reds and vermilion of its fires their cheeks
afire with the heat all who came to
see kilauea did thus then awestruck
inspired perhaps a bit frightened and
dreaming of a cleaner friendlier life dur-
ing the rest of their days they picked up
their bits of lava their envelopes full of
mme peles hair burned the edges of their
souvenir post cards in the red hot fissures
and went their way

  but rhodes-his case was different his
was not to be expected his was unique

  and why

  as i dreamed thus there came a knock
on the door

  i instructed azaki as he came through
the room to answer it

   wait said rhodes quickly  i think
i know who it was

  and he opened the door himself and
stepped outside

chapter iv

      the rumbling of the pit

 confess that i listened intently and
 unashamed of my eavesdropping

        from the soft gutturals of the stran-
gers for i had seen at least three forms
standing in the gathering darkness outside
i knew them to be natives and i cen-
cluded at once that they were bringing
specimens to us-possibly of a whiter-
colored lava formation that was found in
one of the olden craters long since quiet

  yet when after the conversation had
continued for at least five minutes rhodes
gravely and with only a silent nod to me
came in took his hat and left again i
began to wonder what his errand might be

rapidly on the hard roadway the echo
of their footsteps retreated-and i was left
alone with my cigar and my reverie

  heretofore in all our expeditions-and
rhodes and i had been to java to the
aleutian islands to popocatepetl in
mexico to vesuvius in italy and etna in
the island of sicily in our pursuit of facts
about volcanic action-rhodes had been
in all things my confidant and i his per-
sonal matters we discussed with the open-
ness of full and trusting friendship business
matters with the confidence of a friends
suggestion and aid professional matters
with the free give and take acceptance or
mockery construction or sarcastic destruc-
tion of two men who had studied the same
branch of geology and shared the same dis-
coveries the same defeats and who held
the same ambitions for a full score of
years

  and yet here but why i could not for
the life of me see rhodes chose to hold
aloof chose other books than those we
might together enjoy chose other thoughts
than those he might communicate to me
chose other companions than myself for
an untimely and secretive jaunt away from
the laboratory leaving me his lifelong
partner in all he did and was alone

  with my cigar dropping its ashes un-
heeded i stared out at the crater which
now with the great glow in the clouds
above the pit of everlasting fire where
dwelt mme pele and with the living rubies
dotted about the great basin where the little
tongues of lava cqntinually broke up the
open was a veritable bivouac ground of a
mighty army the scene was beautiful
and i confess despite its natural explana-
tion awesome and i shrugged my shoul-
ders as ithought of those books on native
superstition who viewing such a vast
example of natures mightiness could blame
the natives for their beliefs who seeing
that gleam from the fiery pit could mock
the native when he declared that pit to be
under the control of mme pele goddess
of fire-particularly when that mysterious
and all-powerful superwomans hair lay in
every nook and cranny near the pit it-
self i smiled what these simple spirit-
loving spirit-fearing folk would not conjure
the volcanologist



up in answer to their questions of the un-
known

  by ten oclock rhodes had not returned
and a bit disgusted i told azaki to go to
bed and turned in myself

  in the morning at breakfast rhodes
seemed a bit sheepish and hung his head
as though he felt his truancy

  then with the meal half over he sud-
denly burst out

   poor fellows poor chaps-they-they
believe-believe

  i glanced up questioningly

  harrison flashed red as the strawberries
on his plate

   believe eh i said a bit coldly

  he puttered with his spoon

   came to get me last night-me -he
went on hastily yet it appeared to me as
though to confirm his own thought- me
the most practical man in the world-
whose sole ambition is to discover and
make note of the fact-get me to go to one
of their infer-i should say-ungodly na-
tive luaus in honor of mme pele im-
agine -he looked up but his eyes were
anywhere but on mine- imagine that-
me-at a native feast eating seaweed and
unsinged chicken and raw pork liver and
slimy poi-in honor of a kanaka goddess
ye gods

  he puttered once more at his berries

   you left here a bit hurriedly harry
i said

  he hastened to answer-face still red

   they wanted me to hurry-pretty far
to go-and the kahuna said theres a
prophecy or something that theres to be
an eruption a violent one that  cover the
whole island very soon so they wanted me
pele has said it they declare absolutely
sure about it can you imagine that
and getting me-me a man of fact mind
you-fact and cold hard science-to go
to their horrible feed and-well and help
them-help stop that awful thing thats
prophesied

  help them i cried then with i
dont know what underlying thought forc-
ing my words  think you can i ques-
tioned with a bit of scorn in my voice

  his answer was astonishing

   god knows i he said with great rev-

erence-then abruptly put his napkin
down and left the table

  all that day he avoided me

  and that evening again he disappeared

  and so for a week at least each day the
same thing occurred

  our conversations were limited to bare
necessity his attitude do not mistake
me was not unfriendly-but simply aloof
he acted as though a bit ashamed a bit
abstracted a bit frightened of possible con-
sequences of i knew not what-a bit mys-
terious a bit secretive he acted as he
had never acted before two months ago
he was himself harrison rhodes-now
after two months intimate acquaintance
with the volcano he was another man-
another being i might say

  on the evening of the eighth day how-
ever my friend did not as usual retire to
his room nor did the natives come to the
door and call him away

  instead he sat himself down humming
softly- and picked up one of his books and
idly fingered it

  then he said out of a clear sky

   well old man youll admit after what
youve seen of the fiery pit that if there
isnt a goddess of fire there ought to be
one

  i looked up his face was unclouded
clear this i instantly concluded was
more like my friends real self

  absolutely i affirmed enthusiastical-
ly and waited for him to go on

  but he did not-simply sat down and
puffed away at his cigar and turned the
leaves of his book

  and at perhaps ten he arose stretched
himself smiled warmly shamefacedly as
though in confession and plea for forgive-
ness and went off to bed and i after a
glance at the fire-dotted abyss below us
retired too

  i was awakened shortly by a slight trem-
bling of my bed-as though some giant
hand was gently shaking it i sat up in
the darkness and heard a muffled exclama-
tion from the next room as i did so my
bed trembled again and the timbers of the
building creaked protestingly-and i knew
at once-an earthquake-a good one and

this house on the very edge of that dizzy
gulf

  even as i leaped from my bed the door
opened and the giant pajamaed figure of
rhodes stepped in

  his voice was hollow as he spoke-and
his words unbelievable

   even as it was prophesied said he
 it has come to be-mme pele awakens

  a shot of cold thrilled my spine was
the man suddenly mad or was the whole
thing a vast hoax he had contrived to re-
lieve the monotony of our study should
i rush him knock him down and drag him
out of the house before another earthquake
shock should precipitate us both into the
hungry abyss below-or should i pass the
thing off as a joke

  i decided on the latter

 nonsense i cried get some
clothes on and lets get off the edge before
were tumbled in

  his white face shook negatively

   the kahuna said it he went on  at
that first feast he foretold it-mme pele
awakens

   get shoes on anyway-snap into em
i ordered

  he came over and put a hand on my
shoulder-i winced at its chilly touch the
scene was weird enough-what with the
drizzle outside the creak of the house the
pale ghost of this madman beside me the
talk of fire goddesses and all about us
tinged with the crimson reflection from the
glare of the eternal fires without rhodes
patted my shoulder reassuringly

   dont worry old fellow he said sooth-
ingly  nothing will happen to us-at
least -here he hesitated and i saw that
his eyes sought halemaumau above which
the clouds were as of blood- at least he
repeated- not yet

  another rumbling shook the building
the hand on my shoulder gave a spas-
modic clutch

   what the devil do you know about it
i cried  come now youve got to go

  he did not resist and once outside my
own fear left me and i confess i felt the
complete fool that not so long ago rhodes
had called me we waited in the silence
for half an hour or more then following

the example of the hastily clad guests we
could see on the hotel lawn we turned
back to our rooms

  at his door rhodes seized my arm again

   forgive me old man he said quietly
sanely  i-i must have been dreaming-
and those kahunas are so damn impressive
when they prophesy - i admit it - must
have had me going then he nodded to-
ward the crater  i dont see that the
shock has changed things any over there
do you

  through the glass i pould see no increase
or decrease in the palpitating glow above
the fiery pit

   not yet i said shortly

  rhodess hand still held me  not of-
fended old fellow are you he asked

   see you in the morning i answered
and left him

  j could hear him sigh deeply as he en-
tered his own room and later as i lay
avjake unable to sleep as yet i could hear
him tossing and muttering on his bed and
wondered what was so troubling his mind
wets the man a bit crazed by his strenuous
concentration over the gathering of fact
or was the various and vast superstitious
lore of kilauea overpowering his scientific
faith and slowly making him too as con-
fident in the belief in and worship of
mme pele as any native of these islands
or after all was it all a hoax-was he sim-
ply by strenuous means trying to have a
little sport with me

  toward dawn came another knocking on
the door and a thump from rhodess room
but hushed voices immediately following
told me there was no need for me to arise
the natives again yet this time my
friend did not leave with them but short-
ly the door closed and i heard him retire
once more

chapter v

tongues of fire

at the fiery pit that day were fair a
 hundred natives

 come to make sacrifice nod-
ded rhodes a lot more communicative
than lately
the volcanologist



   to their gods i asked to draw him
out

   to mme pele goddess of fire he
said  those fellows last night came to
ask me if it would be all right

  i stared

  came to ask you what do they
think you are-a kahuna

  he shrugged his shoulders and looked
away

   hardly that i think but they know
i study the thing and so- he made an
expressive gesture

 humph i grunted eying him-i
study it too-they dont-

  he wheeled

   perhaps he said shortly- perhaps
i understood them better

 harry i cried then  do you mean
to say that you believe all this bally rot
about this thing being alive and all that
i was resolved to get at the root of things
at last

  when he turned again to answer me his
eyes were aglow but instead of the flood
of biting words i had expected came the
following enthusiastic outburst

  why man man he cried flinging
his arms out wide  it is alive its the
good old mother earth alive form-chang-
ing mother nature struggling to exert her
power and in the struggle shaking the very
earth as she did last night cant you see
man that this living fire is indeed the liv-
ing earth why the very spirit of the uni-
verse is fire-the very heavens are alight
with it at night-the infinitesimal bit of
cosmic dust which we inhabit owes its life
to its congenial warmth fire god its
mans salvation the structure of all our
civilization is built on fire even as is the
ground we stand on at this moment man
is man dominant thinking dextrous be-
cause of fire alive you ask alive
you bet this old kilauea is alive-as alive
as you and i-and its spirit is as animate

   good old mme pele -here he choked
and his face paled and he added in a low-
er tone- and cursed old mme pele
the goddess of fire yes-good for she
warms our bodies-evil for she feeds upon
our souls god eld man if you but un-
derstood her as do i these last days -

his voice broke again then- and pele
-mme pele the living earth rising and fall-
ing leaping playfully storming in diabolic
rage gay dull beautiful in glowing color
now hideously red mouthing at these walls
that hold it in from the destruction it
might do man-the force the living vi-
brant force of it-seeking outlet with little
fingers of it eagerly breaking into the sun-
shine and freedom through every long-
sought weakness in the barrier the outside
cold throws over it great flows of it now
and again seething over the craters mam-
moth lip and seeking to find far fields or
baffled falling deep deep deep back into
the unfathomed depths of halemaumau
back to the comforting bosom of mme
pele back for fiery food and new vigor
and greater reenforcement for the next vast
attempt alive man alive and you
can call it bally rot what these wise old
natives think--what they believe i tell
you friend of mine that had we too
dwelt as long as they beneath the glow
of kilauea beneath the rule of mme pele
we too might hold some strange beliefs

   look below you at those natives-even
now they make sacrifice to pele for last
night she made her power felt last night
came her warning even as the kahuna de-
clared it would even as the kahuna swore
she had told him as he slept-warning
that she was about to rise to summon all
her fires all her terrors and all her di-
abolic hosts of hissing gas and liquid flame
and vast torturing floods of the molten
flesh and bone of earth and sweep with
godlike avenging power over the fair lands
and villages and cities below that once
more can she say  behold how little is
man what conceit hath he in the puny
forces he controls what pride in the pue-
rile destruction he makes in far countries
how vain are the intricate labors with which
he builds in this-while i with but a sin-
gle day of silent use of fire can destroy a
civilization can erect a new land thus
did the kahuna declare mme pele had
spoken in his ear my friend-and thus it
may well be

  rhodes paused breathless

  i stared at him in unbelief-then turned
to the worshipers


all-story weekly

  the natives perhaps a hundred strong
were gathered on the windward side of the
fiery pit in a curved line not a dozen feet
from the sharp cut edge of the crater
the lava pool was now within as many
feet too of fhe brink and was in slow
motion the leathery heat-hazed surface
lead colored heaving gently corrugating-
ly and folding as it spiraled below the
cliffs none of the molten fluid was vis-
ible save where the tough scum met these
jaggedly rising walls and there as usual
the liquid lava constantly and hungrily
lapped lapped at the crumbling rock bit
off huge chunks of it swallowed them bod-
ily and lapped lapped lapped and
mouthed and chewed for more-insatiable
was peles appetite

  the stuff was alive

  a sudden chanting arose from the group
of worshipers and with the rhythm of the
song their bodies moved in unison one
old fellow who seemed to be the leader
tore off all his clothing but a cincture about
the loins and led the chanting and the
dance faster and faster the time arose
wilder and wilder the antics and gyrations
of the dancers became until finally they
went suddenly into frenzy

  i heard rhodes gazing spellbsund beside
me gasp as the madness increased

  and when the leader seized the pile of
his clothing and advanced to the very lip of
the craters maw stood there a moment with
eyes upcast then threw the lot of it into
the mass beneath him my companion mut-
tered

   good old kahuna that  help-
that  help

  and he pointed to the natives who by
now were all casting into the mouth of the
pit small articles they valued-seed chains
poa pots mettfl rings and ornaments saved
from the old days of the whaler settlements
i gripped rhodess arm

   is it sacrifice i whispered

   to pele  he whispered breathlessly-
 to mme pele that kahuna has brought
them here-the prophecy the earthquake
my friend paused a moment then mut-
tered  god if i only could help-could
stop the trouble-could prevent-

  he seized my arm convulsively

   look-look man for gods sake-the
pit-the pit

  i turned from the natives-and froze
stiffly for the level of the lava had risen
half-way to the jagged crust of the verge-
and before my eyes with a silent menace
that was diabolical was swiftly rising still
-but a few scant feet and the margin
would be reached and the fiery stuff rush
over upon us

  for a space i stared hypnotized

  death in the most horrible form con-
fronted us for the crusted lip of the crater
was but for a few jagged bluffs the highest
part of the volcano should that steadily
rising mass of molten fire reach the lip no
power of mans could prevent us and those
simple worshipers from falling its victims

i looked about me and dimly heard rhodes
shouting to the kanakas and saw him mo-
tioning desperately for them to run back
while the chance for life still remained

  they too seemed as dazed as i at the
sudden rise of the lava hypnotized by the
terrible menace of its motion

  the kahuna by his frantic gesticulation
was evidently exhorting them to stay and
he seized treasures from the heap before
him and cast them into the mass to appease
the angry spirit of kilauea rhodes con-
tinued to wildly wave and his voice was
already hoarse from pleading with them to
retreat then suddenly like sheep they
bolted for the little ridge by which they
had come-daring not to cross the slightly
lower swale toward-us

  they were safe and i breathed a sigh
of relief and turned to seek our own re-
treat then i heard a cry that seemed
racked from the souls of men-and i turned
about again

  rhodes beside me pale as death ex-
claimed harshly

   theyre cut off-a flow has broken over
the edge just beyond that turn-theyll
have to risk it this way

  and then he shouted again-and by now
the level of the stuff was lapping at the very
rim and our clothes beginning to smoke

  this way-this way he cried

 your only chance-this- and then he
interjected some words in the hawaiian
tongue of which i knew nothing and had
the volcanologist



never known him to know anything before
then  cross the low place-for gods
sake dont hesitate-come-come ah
god its too late-too late 

chapter vi

the lap of pele

it was indeed too late for even as the
flock was teetering in hesitation the lip
was reached and a wild eager seething
mass hissed triumphantly over the swale

  a shivering wail arose the natives were
cut off on both sides by spreading rivers of
molten rock gorgeous glowing streams
which the veritable arms and fingers of
mme pele herself sought out every nook
every crevice every fissure as we stood
half-dazed the mass in the pit arose higher
and higher and the flood over the rim be-
came deeper and widened hungrily and the
living mass of it arose about the little islet
of higher lava on which the little group of
erstwhile worshipers pitifully huddled

  the kahuna his back to the creeping
death still exhorted his flock to pray to
sacrifice wildly he shouted frantically
he tore off chains from his flock hair orna-
ments clothing and cast them into the
seething torrent vainly he raised his arms
to the crater and cried out to pele to hold
back the horror that crept upon them that
so eagerly devoured with flaming tongues
the sacrifices they had made ta stay the
torture that even now the half-naked as-
semblage was beginning to feel

  a curse gritted at my side and rhodes
megaphoned his hands and pleaded frantic-
ally with them

  sacrifice you fools he cried all
-all-all you have-you there with that
purse in your hand-throw it to pele-
throw it to pele fools is it worth more
than your life will you burn in that hell
of fire before you give that money sacri-
fice-and pele will hear your prayers-give
-give-give-all-all

  madly the kanakas stripped great
chunks of the cliff beside them fell off eaten
away by the blazing flood and floated like
islands on the rushing stream a great
hissing geyser of sulfur smoke and lava

    	a-s

leaped a hundred feet in the air from the
center of the crater the solid crust began
to tremble the natives fell on their knees
on the smoking ground

  pele pele pele

  rhodes pale seized me his breath
came more quietly he was as death itself

   there is but one way he cried to me
 but one way-pele must be appeased and
those fools-

  i turned on him

 we cannot stop that flood lets get
out over that point while we can god
help them-no man can now  i cried
rhodess face set

   no man can save them he repeated
 you are right n man can-but a god
could or a goddess-and pele mme pele 
-he turned once more to the natives-
 give what you have left  he cried  all
-all-sacrifice-or it will be too late

  he turned on me savagely

   there is one way left to save them
he muttered  lead on-ill follow you
one way he cried  and the fools see
it not he gritted his teeth  nor will
i tell them for i see now it is for me to do
the kahuna said it when he told us of peles
talk one way-

  his voice died away behind me though
i could hear the gritting and scraping of
his heavy boots on the crust over which
our path to safety lay

  a mighty wailing arose as we left and
i covered my ars with my hands to keep
it out

  then i cried out once more

   hurry hurry man hurry-the stuff
is higher and higher-and we must cross
there was no answer i turned

  rhodes was not following me

  he was rapidly making his way up a
steep incline that led to the highest crag
overhanging the fiery pit-a mass of hard-
ened lava that arose straight forty feet
above the sea of liquid fire in which pele
dwelled at the very tip with his feet at
the brink itself he paused-his coat and
hair waving in the seaward breeze his pro-
file bending toward the center of the mass
toward the vast geyserlike eruption that
gracefully ponderously and menacingly
diabolic danced in the center


all-story weekly

  a full minute harrison rhodes man of
hard science and cold fact stood there
arms hanging naturally head slightly bent
figure erect then he stretched out his
arms toward that playing fountain of molt-
en stone

   pele he cried clearly simply  pele
-accept a final sacrifice-i am coming
take me and withhold your anger pele-
i am yours

  and he forthwith flung himself from the
crag-flung himself and hung suspended in
mid air a moment even as does an expert
diver then down down-

  involuntarily i started for him hands
outstretched-to help to stop him then
involuntarily too and mercifully my eyes
closed and i fell upon my knees with my
head buried in my hands

  how long i thus remained i do not know
yet when i stumbled back to that same
crag in a sobbing effort to see if something
might not be done about my friend a
sight struck my eyes that has caused me
to wonder much since as to the exact
meaning of harrison rhodess faith

the

   for the flow had ceased the playing
 fountain had fallen and the level of the
 lava now once more gray and leather sur-
 faced had fallen to a vast and dizzy
 depth-the glowing lake of fire had re-
 treated-the crater was now simply a deep
 well of vast size-and for the time at least
 harmless

   and when i looked across to the islet on
 which were marooned the kanakas the tur-
 bulent stream of liquid fire had already
 crusted over the natives were singing once
 more and though to me the song sounded
 more like the funeral dirge of my good
 friend i learned afterward that it was in
 praise of and thanksgiving to the goddess
 of fire to mme pele-who had stayed her
 hand in time and saved their lives

   i blindly found my way back to the
hotel and the first remark of the persons
there was how badly my trouser knees were
scorched

    had i perhaps been worshiping mme
 pele they asked

   and then i told them of the thing my
 friend had done

situta was a misfit in no way did
he share the mighty heritage of his
people the matabele his puny un-
dersized body grotesquely supported by
thin bowed legs was an object of derision
among the people of his kraal

  in sterner days when his people knew
no code save that of the survival of the fit-
test situta would never have reached the
age of manhood death by strangulation
would have been his portion death by
strangulation- for no blood must be
the guardian of the gate



shed look ye lest the scent of it be an
offense to the nostrils of the great spirits
and may inkoosikaas the queen of the
heavens keep ever this ones soul from re-
turning to us but his people had grown
soft with the fruits of victory also the
white men had passed certain womanish
laws and situta lived to pray often for the
death that was denied him

  unable to join the young men in their
strenuous sports slow to follow the spoor
situta though of an age was unmarried
the maidens scorned him for the -weak
thing he was and because he had inherited
no wealth and lacked the ability to pro-
cure cattle

  he occupied an old dilapidated hut that
had been discarded by his fathers oldest
wife it was always in this fashion that
he secured the wherewithal to satisfy the
hunger that was ever gnawing at his vitals
-by taking to himself what others had
cast away he was an outcast shunned
by the young men or at best contemp-
tuously tolerated forced to do the work of
maidens in payment for the food that was
grudgingly given him

  yet the soul of situta was the soul of a
mighty warrior and he gloried in the sto-
ries the old men told of the days when
 men were men and the impis of the
king were as the sand in the river bed he
loved to imagine that those days had come
again picturing himself as a mighty war-
rior rising by his prowess in battle to be
captain of an impi-aye even to the su-
preme council of the king on one occa-
sion in the midst of his dreaming he was
interrupted - as often happened - by the
angry petulant tones of selele whose hos-
pitality he had enjoyed that day

   tcht thou lazy one thinkest thou
the spirits will cleanse the pot while ye
dream

   woman i can no longer stomach this
labor i am a man and this is the work
of maidens

   thou a man art married where
are thy children where is thy head ring
nay thou art no man thou livest only
because we women are tender of heart de-
siring not to see a weakling such as thou
starve

   better would it have been had my
mother strangled me at birth as was the
custom than i should be thus constantly
put to scorn he said bitterly then as
one seeing a way out he added brightly
 i will no longer dwell in this place i
will go where none have ever heard of
situta-the fool

   and where will the mighty one go and
find the people know him not thy fame
is great o little one scoffed the woman

   to the white iakosi who dwells in the
big kraal at plumtree to him will i go
and seek service among his warriors

   thou a policeman thou seek service
with the white man art altogether mad
well art thou named the fool

   ye laugh woman but what i have said
is spoken and the words may not be re-
called for a moment the woman was
overawed and watched him in silence as
he strode away indignantly but his gait
was so much like the strutting of a cockerel
that she forgot her momentary awe and
burst into peals of laughter

   o-ho she cried after him u i must
look to my babes lest they too are
seized with a sudden desire to become war-
riors of the white men

  at plumtree situta sought out the cap-
tain in charge of the police luckily no
one saw him or he would never have been
allowed to enter the hut of the captain all
unbidden as he did the captain was en-
grossed in his wosk and it was with no
little fear that situta stood waiting to be
recognized by the white man yet had he
ever heard that he always dealt justly with
the people

  the captain looked up suddenly from his
papers

   well o man of littleness what seek
ye

   to enter thy service nkosi to be-
come a policeman

   ye must think the great white king is
hard pressed to have need of thee

   nay nkosi it is not that for many
years have i been a thing of reproach to
all men and i seek the service that i may
become a man

  the captain laughed good naturedly
and blew three sharp blasts on a whistle


all-story weekly

   nay fear not he said in answer to
situtas look of terror  i would but show
thee what manner of men are found worthy
to carry the spear of the great overlord

  even as he spoke four police boys filed
into the hut saluted and stood smartly at
attention

  situtas spirits sank within him as he
noticed the contemptuous manner in which
the police boys eyed him selele had been
right such service was not for him these
were men indeed men who would have
been mighty warriors even in the days
when all men carried the spear they tow-
ered above him as the bull towers over the
new-born calf he had never been more
deeply conscious of his inferiority and he
breathed a sigh of relief when the captain
dismissed them

   well o would-be warrior

   i am answered nkosi i was altogether
a fool he saluted clumsily and turned
warily away

   wait as i have said o situta ye
may not be one of the police boys but-
canst obey orders

   yea nkosi that i have done all my
life

   then thou shalt become one of the
watchers of the fence which is even now
being built thy pay will be fifteen shil-
lings a month food will be given thee also
a hut blankets and all the things neces-
sary

   and will i be clad even as these others
and carry the stick of thunder

   a uniform of sorts ye shall have
smiled the captain  and a gun now
make thy mark here that all may be ac-
cording to custom

  it was with no little wonder that the
people of the chief radicladi had gathered
at the council place for many days they
had watched with interest the erecting of
a stout barbed-wire fence along the banks
of the river for seven days trek in either
direction they were told stretched this
barrier between them and the river

  near the place where they were wont to
water their cattle a gate had been let into
the fence and a hut erected near by none
had dared ask the white man the lord of

the fence concerning it for he was not a
man to be questioned lightly and would
without doubt tell all in good time the
fence builders men of their own race were
unable to solve the mystery

   know o ye ignorant ones the fence
is built at the command of the white chief
let that suffice thee said some and
others

   it is a magic to keep the disease from
thy cattle and that of course was folly
for how look ye could a few strands of
the pricking wire keep the evil spirits away
truly all white men are mad

  but to-night all was to be made known
and a wave of excitement swept through
the assembly

   o radicladi and ye people of radi-
cladi-

   hush the white inkosi is speaking

   ye have long questioned among thy-
selves concerning the fence which now runs
between thy village and the river heed
this well across the river in the land of
the mapani bush have but lately come
many herds of buffalo this ye well know
now the white men by their magic know
that these wild ones carry the disease that
eats up thy cattle they are things ac-
cursed at all times possessed by spirits of
evil

   the  pougan that is all belly the ticks
that suck their blood dwell in their hide
only falling to the ground when they have
had their fill should these get on any
one of thy oxen that one would die and
mayhap cause the death of all others it
is an order therefore that thy cattle shall
not cross over to the other side at any
time and to prevent their straying thither
the fence is built

   but nkosi how shall we water our
cattle interposed the chief

   have patience the matter is not yet
all told one comes to dwell in the hut
that was built for him-when the sun is
yet high in the heavens he will come-who
will open the gate for thee in the morning
and again at night only then may ye
water thy cattle and should ye at such
times permit them to stray to the other
side the guardian of the gate will bring
me word and punishment will follow that
the guardian of the gate



is all say now having heard do ye un-
derstand

   yea nkosi we understand and will
obey

   that is well i leave thee now but
will come again in due season to receive
the report of the guardian of the gate he
is my ears my eyes and my tongue look
ye to it

  the arrival of situta at the hut by the
gate was witnessed by many of the people
of radicladi who were idling near by no
move of his escaped their close scrutiny
yet to ail outward seeming they were gos-
siping among themsleves and were fully en-
grossed in the conversation -

  as for situta he affected not to see them
and occupied himself in putting away the
stores that had been left him by the sup-
ply wagon yet withal there was a lurk-
ing fear in his heart that these people
would treat him as the people of his own
village would come crowding round him
holding him up to derision not even the
long military great coat discarded by one
of the white troopers which girded in at
the waist by a rope trailed in the ground
behind him could altogether smother that
fear

  a whole months pay his first he gave
for that coat on his head was a battered
red fez but it was clean and the letters
b s n a p shone like gold as did the
brass buckles of his cartridge belt in his
hand he carried a rifle of an obsolete type
the bore of which was worn smooth but
he never allowed the gun to leave his hand
no matter how heavy the package he was
carrying more often than not he carried it
over his shoulder at the slope it was the
symbol of his authority his talisman-the
symbol of the new life he was now enter-
ing upon

  at last his stores were all piled neatly
away inside his hut the fire lighted and
his food cooking for the evening meal
nothing remained to be done he squat-
ted on his haunches and watched the vil-
lagers furtively they were talking loudly
now-about him without doubt soon they
would come to him call him fool and
worse spit upon him and deal with him
in no gentle fashion he felt that he could

bear the suspense no longer and was
tempted to cry out

   yes i am here situta the fool come
and work thy will on me

  and still they made no move he half
rose to his feet determined to bring mat-
ters to an issue by going up to them then
he remembered his new position the au-t
thority of it and the dignity it gave him
mastering himself with an effort he called
aloud

   hi wena come here

  one of the men came slowly toward him
 what would ye of me  man of the
gate

   i desire amasse-sour milk to eat with
my mealie meal bid one of thy women
to bring me some

   it shall be done say now how shall
we call thee what is thy name

  situta pondered a moment

   ye may call me tousansic his regi-
mental number was  or again the
guardian of the gate that is all now
tell thy woman to hasten for i am a hun-
gered and would eat

  left alone once again situta pondered
on the victory he had won over himself

   without doubt the past is past under
the shadow of the white mans protection
will i become a new man situta the fool
is no more but who then am i 
later when the people came down to
water their cattle situta remained in his
hut until their patience was exhausted and
they cried aloud for him

   open thou the gate  tousansic

   art sleeping or do ye desire us to see
our cattle go mad with the thirst

  if ye hasten not the oxen will break
down the fence shall we then suffer the
punishment because thou art sleeping
not until then did situta come from the
hut he yawned and stretched himself and
made a pretense of rubbing the sleep from
his eyes

 did i hear voices raised in anger
he drew himself erect and made play
with his rifle calling out the orders picked
up from the drill sergeant at plumtree in
a high falsetto voice

   shun

   stan at ease

   shun wha you do you big damn
fool when i give ord you move like ell
nowl should arm quick mar lef ri
lef ri

  to the gate he marched and with a great
show of ceremony unlocked it and let the
cattle through all the time they were be-
ing watered situta marched sentry-go on
the bank above

  one inyorka seeking to try out the
guardian of the gate made a pretense to
take his cattle to the other side

  he was halted by a shrill cry from the
watcher on the bank

   hi man of wickedness bring back
thy cattle to this side or the gun will
speak to thee a message ye will well under-
stand

  inyorka shamefacedly returned with his
cattle without doubt this one tousansic
was not to be trifled with how was in-
yorka to know that the gun was not load-
ed or that situta had never fired a shot
and most certainly could not have hit a
mark at that distance in some part it was
the note of authority in situtas voice that
he also obeyed

   i did but jest o tousansic

   such jests this gun of mine doth not
understand see that ye err not again in
this way

  situtas triumph was complete and that
night he was the one topic of conversation
in the kraal of radicladi his dealing with
inyorka was specially dwelt upon

   au-a of a truth the ways of the
spirits of the great-great are strange how
is it possible think ye that such a man of
wisdom and stoutness of heart can be con-
tained in so little body

   the beer may be strong yet a small
calabash will hold it

   he is in truth a great one in the coun-
cils of the white nkosi remember how
the lord of the fence said  he is my ears
my eyes and my tongue 

   a dealer in magic is he also noted
ye the play he made with the gun that
speaks with a loud noise and the charms
he made

   and when he spoke in anger me-
thought it was the cry of the eagle

  aie he is indeed a man said in-

yorka  look ye i could take him in
these two hands of mine and have broken
him over my knee yet ye saw how i
obeyed his voice and went not across the
river with the cattle

   yea truly we saw that

  so the days sped by happily for situta
for at last he was accepted as a man among
men his slightest commands were obeyed
and the people consulted him in all mat-
ters concerning their cattle a greater
compliment they could not have paid him
even if they had so desired

  always in the evening after the meal
hour he would go up to the village to
share a pot of beer with the chief and
afterward watch the dancing or the wres-
tling bouts sometimes in the manner of
a novice approaching a master the young
men would invite him to try a fall with
them

   it is not meet he would answer them
 for me who am the white mans mouth-
piece to ply the part of a child ye should
thank the spirits for that fact thus did
he preserve his reputation of a mighty
fighter

  and so situta glorying in his new-found
power of authority basking in the sun of
many compliments gained fresh confidence
every day his carriage became more erect
his voice took on a deeper note yet fear-
ing perhaps that his present position was
not sufficient to insure a continuance of the
respect paid him he was wont to tell the
people fictitious stories of his prowess in
fights and in the chase always winding up
with

   and thus it was that the white man
had good cause to say  thou o tous-
ansic art cunning above all others thou
art the rod upon which i lean 

  the long-drawn-out au-a of amaze-
ment at the conclusion of his stories was
sufficient payment

  yet despite it all a fear always lurked
within him-a fear that some one who knew
him in other days would come to radi-
cladis kraal that he knew full well
would mean his downfall

  as day by day slipped away this fear
became less insistent until finally it was
only a faint gnawing at his vitals and
the guardian of the gate



could be easily silenced by describing some
particularly bold deed of his to the people

   besides his duties at the gate situta had
also to patrol the fence to keep it in re-
pair and to report any signs of the dread-
ed buffalo on alternate days he went
north and south a half days trek each
way meeting a man from the neighboring
cattle-guard hut leaving just after the
morning watering he always returned in
time to open the gate again at night while
on such trips his actions would have caused
no little wonder to an observer

  now he would run at his topmost speed
then halting suddenly would crawl on his
belly for a considerable distance taking
advantage of every bit of cover anon he
would take careful aim with his rifle and
squeeze the trigger leap to his feet and
run crying exultantly

   ye little thought what manner of man
ye went against now evil one thy spirit
hath passed on to the land of desolation
and there is none to mourn thee

  one day on returning from his patrol
elated at the news that the captain would
inspect his post on the morrow it seemed
to him that the people who were awaiting
his coming at the gate looked at him con-
temptuously some even snickered as he
went through the drill with his gun

  when he had closed the gate for the
night and all had departed he pondered
over the impressions he had got

   yet it could not have been that they
were scornful of me or that i was the
cause of their mirth without doubt se-
gamba the merry-maker was among them
yes that was all

  up at the village that night no welcom-
ing shouts greeted his appearance and he
was conscious of many curious glances lev-
eled at him as he took his accustomed seat
near the chief he looked expectantly at
the pot of beer the chief held in his hands
but radicladi did not offer it to him nor
in any way show that he was aware of
situtas presence he coughed ill at ease
then decided to plunge straightway into
such a story as would dispel this feeling of
uncertainty

 have i ever told ye  men of rad-
icladi in what manner i slew silwane the

lion having only a hunting knife in my
hand

   cease thy babbling boaster said
radicladi

   what mean ye situta spoke bravely
but an icy fear clutched at his heart

   junva a man of thy village passed
through my kraal to-day dost desire to
know more

  so the blow had fallen junva had al-
ways been foremost among the scoffers in
those other days how far off those days
were and yet how near junva had told
these people-what had he not told them

  situtas first impulse was to flee the
place but was he not in the service of the
white lord who had said  can ye obey an
order and he had replied  yea at
this place he had been ordered to  stay
until relieved there was no way out

   well o chief what said junva that
concerns tousansic

  nay why bandy names we know
thee now for what ye are-situta situta
the fool we know that ye have lied to us
in all things art a man of little worth fit-
only to consort with the maidens never
having been admitted to the manhood of
thy village

   all that ye have told us are lies no
warrior thou never have ye followed the
hunting trail but have been ever content
with the food scorned by dogs-dog that
ye are to us ye came thy belly full of
lies and crawled into our huts like a snake
ah thou a rod upon which the white
man leans look ye to it that the rod doth
not lean on thee

   now get ye gone from my village un-
less perchance the maidens will make a
place for thee around their fire

   thy words are harsh o chief in
some part they are true yet go ye only on
the word of one who was ever my enemy
and wilt thou pass judgment on me now
for what i was thou wert once a child
but now is there one to say that radicladi
the chief is a child	

   this is no matter for words thou
wert situta the fool that ye cannot
change for the rest would ye have me go
to thy friends for thy character where
then are they


all-story weekly

   bear with me a while longer to-mor-
row the white nkosi comes to this place
do ye and all thy people come down to the
but and mark how the white man deals
with me then then shall ye pass judg-
ment

   it will be to thy greater shame but so
much will i grant thee until then thou
art still tousansic now tell us how ye
slew the lion the chief spoke sarcas-
tically

   nay i must return to my hut to make
ready for the coming of the white man

  situta walked briskly away until well
out of sight of the people at the council
place then his head sunk between his
shoulders and his whole form drooped
he was well aware that it would be impos-
sible for him to stay at this place unless he
were content to stay always at his own hut
-never going up to the village

  even so could he face boldly the taunts
and mocking jeers that would be leveled at
him he would be once more a thing
scorned a stone whereon the young men
would sharpen their wits no that he
could not bear

  why had he challenged the people to
witness his treatment at the hands of the
white man true he had dealt kindly
with him at plumtree but situta knew that
he could not possibly hope for any demon-
stration that would give color to his foolish
boast that he was the rod on which the
white man leaned

  the landscape was alight with the soft
radiance of the moon and his shadow went
ever before him distorted and of gigantic
proportions anon the moon passed be-
hind a cloud and his shadow was no more

  ai-e he murmured bitterly it is
even so with me i became big by the
shadow of my lies the truth comes and
lo i am shorn of my power

  a puff adder slowly crossed his path he
nearly trod on it but the reptile made no
attempt to strike him

   it is true i am scorned by all things
even death will have none of me

  the sun was high in the heavens when
a cloud of dust in the distance heralded
the coming of the white nkosi situta
safe in the protection of his hut was first

made aware of his approach by the mur-
murs of the vast concourse of people who
had gathered about the gate to witness his
discomfiture

   ah the nkosi is coming

   now shall we see this boaster abased
 it will be great sport though in truth
there is no need for this further proof see-
ing the man how is it possible that he
could have done all whereof he boasted
 and his voice brother is it not like
the cackling of a hen

  situta still remained in his hut-for he
dared not face the eyes of the people-lis-
tening intently to their words-listening
though he would fain have closed his ears
 a fool he is and as weak as a maiden
 yea and a coward remember ye
that time he bade me turn back from
crossing the river how his voice quavered
with fear and that despite that he car-
ried the stick that kills from afar

   that was the voice of nyorka mused
situta  yet he obeyed my voice

   sauka bona radicladi sauka bona
abanlu coinim

   ai-e good day to thee also nkosi
situta shrank back into a corner of his
hut the white man was here and the
time of reckoning was at hand

   where o ye people is situta the
guardian of the gate

   in the hut nkosi did you mark that
brother he called him situta

all hope of further concealment having
vanished situta resolved to put a brave
face on the matter came out of the hut
quickly and came smartly to the salute
 i await thy orders nkosi

   what make ye here why are ye not
on patrol

   i stayed nkosi to welcome thee at
this place

   thy orders were to patrol the fence
every day is this how ye obey fool
while ye were idling here the fence was
broken yonder now come with me o
thou man of little worth to radicladi
he said  i will return  chief when the
fence is mended and will hold court in the
council place

  wheeling his horse he set off at a hand
gallop back along the fence
the guardian of the gate



  situta heavily laden with coils of barbed
wire nails and hammer his rifle slung
across his shoulder made a great attempt
to keep up with him but was soon forced
to slow down to a walk the jeers of the
people ringing in his ears when he came
to the break in the fence he found the
white man had dismounted and was scan-
ning the ground eagerly

   come hither situta and tell me what
ye see

   a herd of impala were feeding here
nkosi yonder stood the bull the lord of
the herd of a sudden he was affrighted-
see ye how he pawed the ground thus
giving the alarm then they all fled the
first dashing into the fence where they fell
as ye can plainly see the spoor is plain
 thou art not altogether a fool now
what frightened them the ground is
hard and i cannot read the spoor

  in ever-widening circles situta cast
about for the further evidence which would
make the cause of the fright clear after
a while he gave an exclamation of dis-
covery

   i have found it nkosi here by the
bush silwane the lion crouched making
ready to spring

   how long since think ye

   in my judgment but a little while after
sunrise

   um and it is not yet twelve oclock
what think ye where is the lion

   see ye nkosi the strong one made a
kill here is the blood and note how he
dragged the buck without doubt he is
near by resting close to his kill during the
heat of the day

  excitement had conquered any fear si-
tuta might have had when he first noted
the lions spoor besides was not the
white man with him

   come then we will follow the spoor
lead on	

  the veldt hereabouts was barren of
trees but here and there were large clumps
of reeds and tall grasses which all made
potential hiding places of the lion so they
walked warily

   nkosi situta whispered excitedly
pointing to a clump just in front of them
 silwane is there

   good load thy rifle-ye know how
-and should i fail ye will kill him

  how often situta had imagined just
such a situation and now face to face with
it his fingers shook so that he could scarce
take the cartridges from his belt

  the captain threw a large pebble into
the grasses another and another then
as though in answer to such rude sum-
mons like an arrow from the bow a splen-
did body leaped from the cover a tawny
thing of concentrated death

  dropping to one knee the captain fired
but the shot was too high just missing the
brain and before he could fire again the
lion was upon him sending him headlong

  no bullet could arrest such a charge in
mid air hunter and hunted lay in a hud-
dled heap the lion rose and stood over
the man for a moment still stunned by
the bullet but as the temporary paralysis
wore off and the pain-that hot flame that
seared him-began to assert itself he
lashed his tail in anger and turned the cap-
tain over and over with his paw

  meanwhile the white man well versed
in the ways of the big cats kept perfectly
still shielding his face with his arms he
knew that situta was his only chance so
far the lion was regarding him as a curi-
osity had not even unsheathed his paws
uncertain what to do with him

  as for sitata his heart had turned to
water within him he desired to run yet
fear-and something else-kept him from
doing so the great white nkosi had
failed how then could he hope to succeed

  this was the end at least he would
die with the white man  to accompany
such a one to the land of the great-great is
a thing greatly to be desired he mur-
mured but what was it the white man
had said

   if i fail then ye will shoot my life
will be in thy hands

  that was an order

  he walked cautiously up to the lion
once the beast looked up from the  cat-
and-mouse  game he was playing and
snarled fiercely at situta who stopped
dead in his tracks only to move on again
inch by inch when the lion turned his at-
tention to the white man once more


all-story weekly

  now he was quite dose he held his
rifle almost up to the lions ear shut his
eyes and pressed the trigger

  the big cat walked slowly away from
the white man and lay down in the shade
of the reeds close by a nervous twitch or
two and all was over

  joyfully situta helped the white man to
his feet-unhurt save for a few bruises

   thou hast played the man this day

o	situta nay thou shalt be called situta
no longer but silwane for thou hast a lion
heart speak now what shall be given to
such a one as a reward

   the name thou hast given me is all
sufficient nkosi

   why what mean ye

  silwane told his story falteringly at
first then as he saw how sympathetic the
white man was with ever-growing confi-
dence

   and so nkosi they found out that i
was but a fool a liar and a boaster in
no way was i the red upon which ye
leaned

  at the council place the people were
awaiting the coming of the white nkosi
to hold court when he came they were
astounded to see situta walking at bis
right hand

  he is going to hold him to trial the
whisper went round

  but no the white man took the seat

f judgment that had been prepared for
him and just behind and a little to the
right stood the guardian of the gate

   radicladi began the white man
 the fence is yet unmended i have con-
sidered the matter and it is not meet for
a lion-killer to do such work send there-
fore some of thy young men to repair the
fence

   ye look astounded know ye that
inkoosikaas the queen of the heavens re-
gards this one with favor he is at all
parts a man and ye ye and thy people
have seen fit to make a mock of him

   near to the break in the fence thy
young men will find the body of a lion that
this one killed thus saving me from his
jaws they shall take the skin and give
it to this one his name is silwane the
lion

   i tell ye that he is the rod whereon i
lean mark well then how ye deal with
him and be slew at all times to judge too
hastily the way of the great-great is
not always plain

  that night a great feast was held in the
village of radicladi in the seat of honor
sat silwane his feet resting on a magnifi-
cent lion skin

  the young men danced the story of the
kill the name of the hunter was cried
aloud

a shot in the dark

she stood clutching him tightly both
staring in startled fear out through the
open door into the dim light of the
front room there could be no doubt of
who was approaching the cabin and there
was no possible way of escape the whole
situation flashed through shelbys mind-if
macldin was alone he could handle him
yet there was danger that the man might
shoot and the report be overheard by
others then again he might not be alone
it was better to make sure first and then
act but how

  a possibility occurred to him-it was
dark within that second room he could slip
back into the corner and remain concealed
perhaps the fellow would talk would reveal
his plans at least once at his ease he could
be made the victim of surprise but would
olga play the part necessary

   can you act he whispered hastily
 we must fool that fellow

   act i will try how do you mean
what am i to do

   make him talk let him think you are
all right above all keep him from sus-
picioning that i am either here or even
alive

   but how can i -breathlessly- with
the door unbarred and those dead men
he will know something has gone wrong

   tell him they fought and killed each
other but that first they unbarred the door
you found them there and dragged the
bodies under the bench you dared not go
away you were afraid make up some
story there he is now 

  he left her frightened and dismayed by
this sudden emergency and sprang back
into the darkest corner crouching against
the log wall slagins revolver in his hand
shelby was willing enough to fight it out
eager indeed to come to grips with the fel-
low but perhaps there might be a better
way-one which make clear their future
if she would only induce him to reveal his
plans gain his confidence

  he could see her there in the dim light
bending forward and listening a slender
girlish figure then the outer door crashed
open letting in a flood of light from with-
out and a stepsounded heavily on the floor
the young woman straightened up the
clear profile of her face revealed somehow
shelby knew she had braced herself for the
contest macklin must have stopped just
within the door staring about him in
uncertainty

   what the hell is up here he burst
forth angrily confused by the gloom
 sam where are you

   who is sam she asked quietly and
taking a step forward  is that the name
of the indian you left on guard

  he gazed at her open-mouthed for the

moment too astonished to even find speech
her presence but more still her calmness
seemed to fairly paralyze his faculties

   what he stammered finally  why
what are you doing out here who opened
that door where is the damned red snake
anyway

   i do not know very much more than
you do she replied quietly  there was a
fight out here some time during the night
and the bar across the door was knocked
down

   a fight who were they

   a white man and the guard they were
both killed the bodies are there beneath
that bench

   both-both killed he seemed unable
to grasp the fact  who was the white
man

   i do not know

   and you did not even run away-
didnt try to escape

   where could i go she asked  what
was there for me to do but wait for you to
return

  well if this dont beat hell he ex-
claimed  why i thought you was afraid
of me you aint hey

   no i-i dont think i am you were
not rough with me and-and you said you
would have something interesting to tell me
when you got back

  macklin laughed evidently relieved she
had spoken as a child might whose curiosity
had been aroused no doubt she appeared
to the fellow suddenly in a new light

   oh i see my girl youve been thinking
this over have you and decided i might
not be quite so bad after all i thought
maybe youd get over that tantrum after
a while fer shucks i knew that feller
shelby was nothin to you you just mar-
ried him ter git away from ponca didnt
yer

   yes she admitted  that was about
all

   so now hes dead he dont cut no ice
arty more

   but are you sure hes dead

   sure-sneeringly-i dont know how
i could be no surer i turned the cuss over
an he was cold then you dont needworry
none about that wait a minute till i see

who the guy was what tried to break in
here

  she had advanced into the outer room
and shelby edged cautiously along the wall
to get as closely behind as possible without
exposing himself he could hear macklin
cross the room and jerk the blanket from
off the bodies the fellow gave utterance
to an oath of astonishment at the sight
revealed

   my god did you ever see anything
like that locked together like two stags
hell sam was shot but he got the white
guy even after he was dead damn me if
it aint hank slagin now what the hell
does that mean i reckon hanley sent the
galoot in here that comes from spillin
things when yer drunk say that guy
didnt say nothin to you did he

   i never saw him

   but the bar was taken down

   it must have been knocked down dur-
ing the fight i didnt know the door was
open until later

   then thats all right only you an i
have got to get out of here ill tell you
about it as quick as i can i didn t go to
gerlasche thats why im back here so
soon an its damn lucky i come its plain
enough hanleys got his eyes on you an

chance

   what is it you mean i do not under-
stand

    naturally yer dont seein i aint told
yer nothin but now that i know yer aint
pining away over that feller shelby i
reckon the sensible thing fer me to do is
ter talk straight theres goin ter be hell
to pay in this valley before long and the
sooner we get out of here the better i run
across a soldier bout half-way ter gerlasche
an he give me a pointer that made me
wheel about an ride back he was carry-
ing despatches

   the indian outbreak

   sure the troops got in an rounded
most of the sioux up they had a fight at
wounded knee over yonder an licked hell
out of the reds some of em got away
though an come trailin west--mostly
young ones i reckon an now theyre
sendin cavalry out ter ride em down
comrades of peril



thats what he was after a bunch to come
scoutin in through here

   here wolves hole

   more n likely he didnt say nothin
bout that but theyre mighty liable ter
call some of those soldier guys must know
this place an the valley is full of reds right
now a hidin out there is goin to be one
hell of a fight if a bunch of them soldiers
ever drop in here believe me im fer gettin
out while the goins good thats what i
come back for-to get you and skip

   to-to get me

   of course ill tell yer about it now
an youll go all right i thought maybe
you wouldnt the way you acted before but
now you seem to have got some sense
thats what i like in a girl i reckon you
never thought i run off with you cause i
loved you

   no-you-you loved me

   thats the way of it i saw you long
before that funeral down to ponca but this
guy shelby horned in fore i was ready to
act then i got a chance to go out long
with him to herd steers he laughed scorn-
fully  but just the same i knew how
things was i could see that plain enough
ridin along behind you didnt care noth-
in for him not a tinkers dam so i says
to myself then ill have her ill take her
whether she wants me or not long as she
dont love him ill make her love me see
course i didnt aim to do no killin that
was just an accident like an i didnt do it
nohow it was sam here who got gay and
beaned shelby all i told him to do was to
knock the fellow out so wed get a good
start on the trail

   but what would you do with me if-if
he had been alive

   there aint no use discussin that fer
he aint alive its what i want ter do now
that counts maybe i had a plan then an
maybe i didnt but now i got it all
planned up proper im a goin ter marry
you an that goes whether yer are willin
or not i aint even askin you

  the expression of her face must have
brought the fellow a realization that per-
haps he was going altogether too fast for
he broke in with an explanation

   see here now dont get huffy i aint

no western roughneck for you to be
ashamed of i belong down east in ol
virginia an we got money to bum thats
straight goods my real name aint mack-
lin at all its churchill youll have things
mighty soft after you marry me a darn
sight different from that cottonwood ranch
anyhow young lady i mean business an
just as soon as indian joe gets down here
with some horses were a goin ter start

   for where her voice trembling in spite
of every effort at self-control

   to gerlasche first theres a preacher
there an then on to gods country just as
fast as the train will take us thats my
program an let me tell you ill be damn
glad ter git away from injuns mexes an
the rest o this rotten outfit no you wait
that will be indian joe cornin now 

  the door between the two rooms had
closed partially yielding doubtless to some
faint draft of air so that shtlby ventured
to survey the scene through the narrow
crack near the hinges matters were be-
coming so complicated he was at his wits
end this sudden resolve of macklin to
immediately flee the valley and take olga
along with him overturned his every hope
of their escape he had delayed too long
and perhaps it had been a mistake to advise
the girl to thus appear friendly to this brute
the egotism of the fellow had at once taken
everything for granted now instead of
being confronted by the kid alone he must
also face laud if he would prevent her
being carried away the second time the
situation had become desperate

  he could see the girl standing pressed
dose to the wall the light from the broken
window on her face her eyes anxiously
watchful of the movements of macklin
who had turned and was fronting the outer
door one hand resting in readiness on the
butt of his  then that opening was
shadowed and the bulky figure of the
squaw man suddenly appeared he stopped
on the threshold blinking into the gloom
barely able to distinguish for a moment the
outlines of the two his first utterance was
full of ill-humor

   well i got your message and am here
he said roughly  what the hell is up

  laud evidenced his surprise and incre-
dulity with a grunt and a swift glance at
the silent girl shrinking back against the
wall

bys ranch up on the cottonwood

bound to get there

   and the sooner were off the better id
like to know who that guy is but there aint
no time now to stay and hunt him you
ready

  he wheeled and confronted the shrinking
frightened girl who made no reply

   well by god you better be get the
horses joe ill fetch her along all right
shelby straightened up in spite of the
odds he must act now or never yet
before he could taken a step forward a
single shot rang out sharply he saw
macklin fling up his arms and reel back-
ward his body striking the half-open door
before it crashed to the floor and lay
motionless

chapter xxii

the first shots

the impact of macklins body had
flung the door wide open leaving
shelby fully exposed to view for an
instant however the startled and bewil-
dered laud failed to note his revealment
against the darkness of that interior he
had leaped back instantly to the protection
of the wall and gun in hand crouched
there with eyes fixed on the broken window
opposite shelby was swift to take advan-
tage of his surprise wherever the shot
had come from whoever had fired it his
concealment was no longer possible there
must be no hesitancy no delay he stepped
across the motionless body with weapon
flung grimly forward

   hands up joe put them up first be-
fore you turn around stop that dont
try any tricks on me now stand there
olga

   yes

   take that gun out of his hand there is
another in his belt better get- that also
thats right now come over here you
understand firearms

  yes of course wonderingly i know
how to shoot

   i imagined so calkins would have

  taught you keep this fellow covered and
let him have it if he makes any effort to
break away watch him closely while i rip
up that blanket and tie him up

  he left her with the gun steadily pointed
at lauds head the fellow cursing with
hands up his angry eyes following every
movement he was desperate maddened
by sudden helplessness with the sneaking
ferocity of a wolf yet was temporarily held
motionless -jby the deadly peril shelby
stripped the ragged blanket from off the
dead bodies under the bench and began
hastily to rip it apart the black bloated
face of slagin stared upward and indian
joe saw it for the first time a sudden spasm
ofterror causing him to burst forth

   my god whats that

   a little reminder joe returned shelby
sternly  life is mighty cheap around
here

   but thats hank slagin

   sure it is he got his an youll get
yours if you drop those hands you cur
turn around now and stop talk

  laud obeyed his face ugly and threaten-
ing and shelby took a step closer the strip
of blanket in his hands his revolver thrust
back into his belt what indian joe saw
will never be known perhaps a slight
wavering in the eyes of the girl perhaps an
instant lowering of her gun but it was
enough all his hate and treachery drove
him to a desperate chance with the mad-
dened leap of a wild beast he sprang upon
shelby gripped him fiercely by the throat
and the two went headlong to the floor

  olga fired but without aim missing them
both and dare not pull trigger again so
tightly were the men grappled as they
rolled back and forth in frenzied effort to
obtain mastery shelby taken completely
by surprise was at a disadvantage his
throat crushed by sinewy hands his loos-
ened revolver flung half across the room
he could only struggle to break the hold of
his antagonist rolling over and over and
forcing the fellows head back with every
ounce of strength he could summon into
play

  they were not unevenly matched the
two-shelby the younger and perhaps the
stronger but laud a skilled fighter hard

  as nails and ready to resort to any trick
moreover he knew what he had set out to
accomplish and bent every effort to prevent
the frightened girl from getting a shot at
him he hung on his straining hands like
a vise twisting tighter and tighter shelbys
shirt-band careless of any injury to himself
so that he kept the body of the latter in
protection between him and olgas revolver
yet with every move every straining whirl
of their bodies he gained an inlh nearer the
open door he fought like an animal sink-
ing his teeth into shelbys flesh and driving
his knees into his body

  it was silent bitter fighting every mus-
cle strained to the utmost and the squaw-
man won they knocked over the bench
and crashed out through the partially open
door rolling down the single step into the
weeds laud landed on top his fingers still
clutched on shelbys throat the latter half
unconscious crazed maddened as he was
the one desire to escape overcame his eager-
ness to kill and indian joe cursing struck
once at the upturned face leaped to his feet
and plunged into the shelter of the woods
shelby gasping painfully for breath
scarcely yet fully realizing what had oc-
cured lay motionless but for the quivering
of his limbs

  indeed he had scarcely forced open his
eyes when olga was beside him

   you-you are alive he did not kill
you 

  he endeavored to smile lifting himself
upon one elbow

   no no i am all right he gasped
u the fellow got my throat and i couldnt
break his hold the treacherous hound got
me that time you fired once

   yes but did not dare try it again i
got as near as i could she explained swift-
ly  but he managed to strike me with his
foot and knocked me down then you
rolled out of the door there was no time
for me to do anything

   i know i was a fool and off my
guard it is no fault of yours i should
have taken no chances with the dog
where did he go

   down there through the weeds to the
creek he had a horse down below

   and rode away

   i think so i am not sure i-i cared
for nothing then but you i thought per-
haps he had killed you

  shelby struggled to his feet his strength
returning although he could scarcely swal-
low and every word he uttered pained him

   that devil will be back the hole is
full of indians our only chance is to get
away before he can gather a bunch of his
kind together	

   get away where

   up the bluff the place in which i hid
last night once safely a hundred yards
up the creek we would be out of sight and
it will take them a while at least to find us

i	believe the trail goes clear to the top but
wait my revolver is inside the cabin

  he started back and olga followed close-
ly standing upon the step and looking
down the valley his head now above the
level of the surrounding weeds shelbys
teeth clinched tightly to keep back an oath
and his eyeis darkened

   theres no time left he said grimly
pointing  laud has got his gang already
were sure up against it now

  even as she stood beside him straining
her neck to see the cadence of a wild
whoop came echoing to them from the dis-
tance they were coming across the flat
riding straight for the cabin and lashing
their ponies as they came

   are-are they after us she sobbed
grasping his arm  are-are you sure

   no doubt of it thats laud a leadin
em them injuns will do whatever he
says come in quick we got to fight it out
here i reckon there aint much chance
but im likely to get some o that outfit
hurry olga there aint even a minute
to lose

  he crashed the door shut and flung the
bar into place then dragged forward the
heavy bench and braced it as best he could
the interior was dark only the little stream
of light stealing in through the hole he had
wrenched in the planking of the window
enabling them to find their way about he
had to feel along the floor to recover his
lost weapon and before he could straighten
up -again the wild chorus of yells rang out
close at hand mingled with the sound of
horses crashing recklessly through the maze
comrades of peril



of weeds-almost to the very door olga
had shrunk back against the side wall and
shelby could scarcely locate her in the
gloom he was the fighting man now cool
and eager

   you have the two guns yet

   yes

   give me one of them probably i am
the best shot

  he looked straight into her eyes

   you are not frightened little girl

   oh yes i am but-but i am not going
to break down you-you dont need to be
afraid of me

   im not i know the real thing when i
see it youll stay till hell freezes over
only see here first-do you know who those
devils are out there

   sioux indians aint they

   aye and the worst of the tribe-out-
casts hell-hounds and the white man with
em is no better there aint goin to be
no mercy in this fight whatever happens
dont you let em take you maybe theyll
get me first but if they do you keep a shot
in your gun you know what i mean
the lines about her mouth hardened
there was a semblance of the old sullen
look in her eyes

   i know tom shelby she said stead-
ily  dad calkins used to tell me that be-
fore i ever met you i aint goin to be
made prisoner

  he gulped in his throat his lips grim and
hard set

   maybe youd shake hands he asked
doubtfully  seems to me id rather like
it if you did

   of course i will and she thrust out
both hands to him in sudden eagerness
 why shouldnt i tom shelby i like
you

  in the darkness she could scarcely see his
face but she felt the grip of his fingers and
caught the eager tremor in his voice

   i sure am glad you said that he ad-
mitted as helpless to express himself as a
child  i sorter wanted you to for-for a
long while hell thats laud out there
now

  he stepped over beside the door whip-
ping both revolvers from his belt and hold-
ing one in each hand a small round hole

    	a-s

had been dug through the adobe plaster be-
tween the logs and he bent down with his
eye to the opening the scene revealed be-
yond was a narrow one a little segment of
a circle but he gained glimpse of those close
at hand

  a tall rangy white man with a dirty skin
and scraggling red beard was nearest at
hand and beyond him crouched an indian
naked to the waist his face blackened and
chest disfigured with gaudy paint there
were others behind these scattered out in
fan shape but he could only make them
out indefinitely laud stood so close to the
door his face could not be seen but he held
a rifle in his hands pounding with the stock
on the wood as he angrily demanded ad-
mittance

   come on out of there you big fool
he roared maddened by the silence  we
saw you go back inside and weve got you
this time come on now i wont ask you
again 

   on what terms

  shelby asked this more to prolong delay
than anything else the fellows knew they
were there and it was useless to pretend
otherwise

   terms-hell  and indian joe burst
out into a loud laugh  hear the cock
crow hanley well make terms when we
get hands on you you damn sneaking spy
only ill say this youll get it harder if you
hang on after we do get you-an by tlod
well get yer sooner or later

   well take the chances laud and
youd better know the fun is not going to
be all on one side

   it wont hey so yer goin ter fight
all right but theres more o this outfit
cornin an yer a blamed idiot if we cant
git yer no other way i reckon we can burn
yer out come out now-save time and
open up

  he struck hard and angrily with his gun-
stock but the stout wood held shelby
made no answer again bending low and
peering out through the narrow opening
the obstinate silence must have maddened
the fellow for he suddenly reversed his
weapon and fired the ball crashed
through the wood leaving a jagged hole
and embedded itself in the solid log of a

back wall before the smoke blew away
shelby replied sighting out through the
small aperture determined to make every
shot count

  the nearest white man flung up his arm
which dripped blood grabbed it and ran
the crouching indian behind crumpled up
as though crushed by some sudden weight
and never moved laud sprang backward
startled by the swift response from within
the smoke swirling up between his fingers
and shelby let drive whether the speed-
ing bullet struck or missed he never knew
but the squaw-man gave one startled leap
into the concealment of the weeds fell
headlong and then went scrambling down
to the bank of the stream it was all so
swiftly accomplished as to seem like a flash-
light picture

  when the smoke cloud rolled away not a
figure was to be seen shelby stood up
grimly smiling and replaced the cartridges
in his weapon the end was not yet but
it was evident he had taught them a lesson
in caution

  for a moment blinded by gazing out into
the sunlight he could see nothing clearly
about him not even the figure of olga he
took a step or two back into the gloom of
the room nearly falling over the two dead
bodies on the floor the uncanny touch of
them against his foot gave his nerves a sud-
den shock

   where are you he asked

   here by the other door what has
happened

  he laughed put at ease by the quick
response of her voice

   oh i took pot-shot out through a hole
in the wall i thought we might as well
start the ball joe was getting so gay
touched up two of them now theyll go
back and talk it over

   but theyll be back

   sure the indians will be for waiting
till night an that aint far off maybe
they will but laud is some mad i reckon
the way he went down that bank was a cau-
tion i aint seen nothing funnier for a long
while what are you doing down there
there was a note of startled surprise in
her voice

   why this is strange i-i hadnt no-

ticed before  was too frightened perhaps
-but come quick macklins body is not
here it-it is gone

chapter xxiit

the attack on the cabin

there was no sound from without ex-
cept occasionally the echo of a distant
voice shouting shelby startled by
these words and alarmed by her agitation
crossed the room he could see better now
his eyes becoming accustomed to the gloom
while the single ray of light streaming
through the broken shutter fell directly on
the spot where the body had been previous-
ly lying on the floor it was gone actually
gone as he bent over incredulous dis-
trusting the evidence of his own eyes he
could perceive the stain of blood in which
the man had fallen but that was all there
was no sfemblance of a body there shelby
stared about into the dark shadows almost
believing he dreamed then into the dimly
revealed outlines of the girls face

   judas priest he said soberly  this
beats anything ever i saw he couldnt
have been killed but i never saw him
twitch a muscle after he dropped gone
darn if i know what to make of it why
where could he have gone to there aint
but one way out from this shack an he
sure didnt go out there

   no he couldnt her voice quavering
 we would have seen him if he had

   seen him of course we would he
must have revived and crawled away you
bet there aint no mystery about it dead
men aint movln around an there aint no
angels cornin down to carry that cuss off
whats happened is he got back strength
enough to crawl likely he got into that
back room out o sight anyhow im
goin to find out whats happened you
keep an eye at that hole in the wall yon-
der while i scout around a minute if you
see anything movin in shootin distance
just blaze away

  she went forward as he told her without
a word and stared out yet nervously turn-
ing her head about at the slightest sound
shelby waited a moment listening and then
comrades of peril



stepped confidently forward across the
threshold of the inner door he had no
doubt of what he would discover-macklin
dead or alive outstretched on the floor
the fellow must be there he could have
gone nowhere else

  the place was as black as night a step
beyond the entrance and he had to grope
his way blindly unable to distinguish a sin-
gle object there was something grim and
ghastly in feeling about with his feet for
an unseen body then the fellow might
still be alive even dangerous he stopped
at the disquieting thought and spoke sharp-
ly into the gloom

   are you there macklin come speak
up nobody is going to hurt you

  there was no response no movement no
sound of a groan no pulsing of breath the
stillness was intense horrible shelby
gripped himself and began to advance slow-
ly guiding his passage along the wall ex-
pecting every instant to encounter some
obstacle his groping feet touched noth-
ing inch by inch he explored the floor of
the room the perspiration beginning to
stand in drops on his forehead there was
no body lying there no form of a man ei-
ther living or dead the place was absolute-
ly unoccupied

  he could hardly believe this true his
mind refused to grasp the fact he came
back to the door dazed and unnerved
good god the fellow couldnt have got
away there was no means of escape no
opening all nature all reasoning told him
the man must be somewhere within the
cabin any other thought was simply im-
possible yet where he had already ex-
plored every inch of surface to no result
so bewildered and dumfounded was he be-
fore this mystery he was even startled at
the girls voice asking an eager question

 is he there did you find him
no i confess i cant make the affair
out it certainly beats my time complete-
ly hes gone as though he had a pair of
wings

   but how could he get out

   thats what i say everything is solid
no human could vanish through these walls
there isnt a window not boarded up and
only one door we wasnt outside ten min-

utes nor ten feet away from the step a
rat couldnt have passed without bein seen
blamed if it dont make me shiver for by
thunder however it happened he aint
here he aint nowhere in this cabin an
he added peering at the floor  there aint
no trail o blood to show tjiat he crawled
away just that little pool what he laid in
 could he have got through the roof or
the floor

  shelby laughed despondently

   lord i dont easily see how he could
its fifteen feet to them rafters an no open-
ning while judging from outside the floor
must rest plumb on the ground who shot
him anyhow did you see

   yes i did she explained excitedly
 i was looking that way toward where the
board was ripped off the window i just
had a glimpse of a face behind the muzzle
of the gun it was a woman i am sure it
was a woman with black eyes then the
smoke obscured everything and she was
gone

   a young woman with black eyes

   yes a girl rather and-and pretty

   she must have been pancha he ad-
mitted struggling with the idea  why
of course thats all plain enough she over-
heard what he said and fired in mad pas-
sion

   what do you mean what are you
talking about this girl

   sure i told you about her she helped
me escape last night she was crazily jeal-
ous over macklin he had made love to
her no doubt and her only desire then was
to get rid of you she thought you were
trying to get the fellow away from her and
the only reason she helped me was because
i promised to take you away with me

   but who is she does she live in this
place

   she is mexican and is here with her
brother-a little outlaw no doubt knowing
no law but her own passions she must
have been there when he boasted to laud
that he would leave her and marry you
it drove her crazy and she shot

  i can understand that - yes olga
burst forth- and later she was sorry i
believe it was she who came back and took
the body away


all-story weekly

   i hardly see how that theory helps
much how could she take him

   perhaps she may know some secret pas-
sage there might be one underneath it
is a puncheon floor surely it is not impos-
sible for one block to be loosened and a
passage excavated through the earth below
i do not know yet in what other way could
the body have been removed

  shelby shook his head gloomily his eyes
searching the floor for any evidence and
finding none to all appearances it ap-
peared smooth and solid

   i dont know he said  that idea
may be as good as any you might take
this broken knife of mine an see if you can
start anything what was goin on out
there

   nothing much that i could see there
are men hiding behind the bank of the
creek i think they are indians and there
may be others off to the right in the weeds
 just a guard left there to see we dont
get away theyll wait until dark and then
try to burn us out i reckon the bucks
dont like my shooting that was a rifle
 yes the bullet struck the log

  he crossed over and looked out anx-
iously

   i thought it might be a signal but i
guess not dont seem to be anything
moving he straightened up again his
eyes surveying the room if we only had
two more in this outfit we might give those
devils a run for their money the trouble
is we cant defend only two sides an they
know it anyhow laud does theyll shoot
away here while the rest of the bucks
comes in through the woods an sets things
blazin back yonder im goin to haul this
bench over on that side then you can stand
up there and shoot through that hole in the
window while i pepper them from here in
front well make it hot while it lasts
she watched him shift the bench and
then stood upon it to look out the sun
had gone down and the valley swam in
a purple haze if she would utilize what
little light still remained she must search
at once

   nothing out there

   i can see nothing moving it is grow-
ing dark let me take the knife

  he gave it to her and she got down upon
her knees on the floor anxiously testing the
openings between the blocks with the bro-
ken blade shelby turned his head occa-
sionally barely able to distinguish her
movements yet felt little confidence in the
success of the effort still he realized this
was their last and only hope the cabin
was undoubtedly surrounded and would be
made an object of direct attack so soon as
it became dark enough to permit the savage
assailants to creep up closer unseen any
attempt at escape through the one door
would be suicidal in all probability in spite
of the silence and seeming loneliness of the
scene without a dozen rifles were even then
trained on the entrance ready to shoot
them down the instant either appeared
and there was no other way out unless it
might be through some secret passage exist-
ing underground macklin had certainly
disappeared somewhere the vanishing of
his body was no miracle and this theory of
how it might have been accomplished alone
appeared reasonable

  in spite of his doubts the man held to
a measure of hope nothing else than this
remained which he could cling to their only
chance lay in some such discovery yet
the woman groping on her knees in the
deepening darkness gave no sign of en-
couragement shelby could bear the strain
no longer in silence

   is nothing to be found he asked anx-
iously  no appearance of a trap

  she lifted her head with face turned to-
ward him

   nothing that i seem able to move she
answered   have found a block which
does not appear to fit as tightly as the oth-
ers i can get the knife blade between and
it doesnt seem to touch any earth below
yet the slab is immovable

   let me try my strength

  he started back to join her but at that
instant there came a sudden burst of rifle
fire without bullets thudding into the cabin
walls the sound punctuated by savage yells
shelby whirled about instantly and dropped
to his knees with eyes peering out through
the opening between the logs olga also
deserted her search and climbed to her post
of defense on the bench
comrades of peril



  the surrounding darkness enabled them
to perceive little-only the flashes of flame
cleaving the night and occasionally the flit-
ting of a dark form in the momentary glare
the firing was continuous and rather heavy
yet the sound of the guns did not seem to
indicate advance the marksmen evidently
still remained concealed beneath the pro-
tecting bank of the stream or else skulked
in the shadow of the woods the bullets
did no damage generally finding billet in
the solid logs although a few crashed
through the planking of the door to shel-
by the meaning was sufficiently plain the
real danger lay as he expected at the rear
all this noise was being carried on merely
to attract their attention he called across
unable to see his companion but well aware
where she was

   dont waste any shot until you see
something within range those fellows out
there are just plugging away blindly
theyll never rush this side keep your
eyes wide open though im going back
and try to knock off a board from that rear
window if i can get a few shots out there
well block their little game your-hear
yes i think one or two are crawling
closer through those weeds

   likely enough young bucks who cant
hold back keep your eye on them an let
them have it as soon as you are sure call
out if you need me

  he groped his way as far as the inner
door helped by the almost continuous flash
of the rifles outside he had even crossed
the threshold his heart choking him as he
perceived a glare of red flame already vis-
ible here and there through narrow chinks
between the logs perhaps he was already
too late-those devils had fired the cabin
the licking flames even then beginning to
eat into the dry bark he had no time in
which to act or even think

  before he might venture another step
forward olga fired twice rapidly the flare
of her revolver lighting up the entire in-
terior what followed he scarcely knew
there was a sharp cry the crash of the
overturned bench and the sound of a body
falling heavily on the floor a revolver
went spinning noisily across the room and
then all was still and black once more

  shelby could see nothing only the
blurred memory of that single instant had
seared itself on his brain she had been
shot-his wife this girl he had learned to
love some stray shot from an indian rifle
fired blindly in the dark had found fatal
passage through that broken shutter and
struck her down his first helpless daze
changed into a rage for revenge mingled
with a wild yearning that he might yet find
her alive  olga he cried out olga

  there was no answer no movement all
was black soundless even the rifle fire
without had ceased

  he dropped to his knees and crept for-
ward feeling along the floor with out-
stretched hands dreading each instant to
touch her body suddenly his searching
fingers encountered an opening in the
puncheon floor

chapter xxiv

the barrier of flame

shelby dared not move except to feel
downward into this mysterious open-
ing yet he realized instantly what
must have occurred-the miracle which
had so swiftly disclosed this secret passage
the girl in falling had dislodged the very
block in the floor she had been endeavoring
so vainly to jliscover it had suddenly
swung downward to the heavy blow of her
body and she had fallen with it into the
unknown darkness below but was she
dead or alive had the fall stunned her
he drew himself to the very edge listening
what was down there macklin perhaps
the two bodies might be lying there to
gether in a common grave but wait-
something moved surely

   olga speak to me

  he could not restrain the agony with
which he uttered the words frightened as
she was dazed by the fall scarcely con-
scious even yet or able to actually com-
prehend what had occurred his cry pene-
trated her mind brought her back to life

   yes i-i am here tom she man-
aged to say weakly

   and you are not hurt his voice thrill-
ing now with a sudden return of hope


all-story weekly

   oh i-i dont know i cannot even
tell what has happened i stepped back
quickly the bench overturned and i fell
it is all earth around me-where am i

   in the passage beneath the cabin he
explained quickly  it has been a miracle
your fall opened the trap perhaps we may
escape from these devils yet make room
for me to come down the cabin is already
on fire is the hole deep

   not very i think and there is room
he lowered himself but it was not neces-
sary to drop his feet struck the earth floor
and as he turned his hands came in con-
tact with the slab still dangling just as
it had fallen obeying the first impulse
aware of a sudden outburst of red flames
somewhere above him he forced the block
upward back into its place jamming it
there with all his strength until a sharp
click convinced him the puncheon again
was securely held they were alone iso-
lated in the black depths underneath the
burning cabin buried deep in the protect-
ing earth he reached blindly out through
the darkness until he touched her his fin-
gers closing convulsively on a fold of her
dress in the sudden reaction he felt as
weak as a child unable even to control his
speech

   it was god who helped us he said
humbly  no one else could you are sure
olga you are unhurt

    must be bruised i suppose it was
an ugly fall and-and i really think i lost
consciousness at first then i seemed to
hear you call me a long ways off

   i did call you-twice it was to the
second call you answered  was wild for
i thought you had been shot what sort
of a place is this we are in

   i know nothing there was light up
there a red glare before you closed the
trap is the cabin afire

  yes those devils started it at the rear
i could see the flames through the clinks
between the logs it was blazing fiercely
then now it must have reached the roof
you can hear the wood crackle even down
here and we must get farther back out of
the way when the roof falls this part of
the floor may go

  in spite of the increasing volume of

flames above scarcely a glimmer of red light
succeeded in penetrating to where they
were hidden a very slight glow found en-
trance through a narrow crack above them
yet shelby was compelled to learn their
immediate surroundings more by sense of
touch than sight they were in a mere
hole scooped out from the soft earth hard-
ly wider than the trap-door which led to it
the other puncheons of the cabin floor rest-
ing solidly upon the ground the trench
led to the right sinking deeper as it ad-
vanced and within a foot or two showing
evidence of an earth roof supported by a
rude frame-work shelby leading the way
feeling his passage along inch by inch was
suddenly halted by an earth barrier which
seemingly blocked all further progress two
props had fallen and with them the weight
of earth they supported leaving a great
pile of debris across the passage he could
feel that it did not wholly reach the top
leaving a space there through which it might
be possible to crawl

  yet what would there be beyond why
should they venture further at present
laud was outside with his indians the
whole scene lit up with the glare of flames
they dare not venture to expose themselves
here they were beyond reach protected
from both flames and savages unless some
among those assailants knew the existence
of this tunnel or accidentally stumbled
upon its outer entrance they could scarcely
be exposed even if some one or two found
their way in this barrier of earth would
block them and if necessary form the best
possible defense

  undoubtedly lauds first belief would be
that they had perished in the fire had either
been killed or had killed themselves rather
than be captured he would have no rea-
son to think anything else before the de-
bris could be searched for evidence of their
fate the opportunity to creep out unseen
and get away might be far better than at
present confident that they had perished
and that their charred bodies were lying in
the midst of the still-smoking embers of
the cabin there would be no guard watch-
ing for an attempt at escape he reached
out and grasped her hand drawing her down
beside him
comrades of peril



   what is it she asked in a whisper

   a fall of earth nearly blocking the
passage he explained  i can see noth-
ing beyond so the entrance must be some
distance away i have no idea where the
tunnel leads to and if i did we would
never dare creep out into the open at pres-
ent

   you-you think we had better remain
here   -doubtfully

   until the fire dies down perhaps even
longer let them believe we died in the
cabin then there may be some chance for
us to get away

   but they will search the ruins

   not for some time those logs will be
glowing embers for hours that sounded
like the roof falling in then it was-see
it has crushed its way down through the
floor there is a caldron of fire in that
hole we just left but it cant reach us here
-only the smoke

   will it not show them where we have
gone

   i hope not probably the smoking blaz-
ing timbers will choke up the opening leav-
ing it so filled with partly burned wood as
to conceal it entirely anyhow this is our
one chance we would be shot down merci-
lessly outside

  the glre frorrthe burning rubbish re-
vealed their faces and the smoke began to
swirl past them in clouds yet did not choke
the tunnel showing there must be an open-
ing somewhere beyond to the outside shel-
by fastened his neckerchief over the girls
nose and mouth and protected her as well
as himself by means of his coat scarcely
conscious of the action they sat thus their
hands clasped gazing at the leaping figures
of flame and listening to the variety of
noises reaching their ears

  the position while one of brooding hor-
ror did not apparently involve immediate
peril the flames could not reach them
and it was already evident that those dense
volumes of smoke while disagreeable and
suffcating could still be endured but be-
ing cooped up there in that hole under
ground unable to venture forth choked
by the fumes their faces smarting from the
heat the earth walls holding them in prison
death waiting for them whichever way they

turned brought a strain to olga she could
no longer combat impulsively she clutched
the man beside her her head touching his
shoulder her slender form trembling to a
sudden outburst

   dont lose your nerve he whispered
startled by her action  nothing can hurt
us here

   oh i know it is not that the words
almost a sob  i do not think i am really
frightened only-i-i want to feel you
near me

   me he questioned surprised  why
i havent been much good so far

   oh but you have you have been splen-
did no woman could ever ask more i
want you to know how grateful i am

   well i dont just like that he pro-
tested  there aint no cause for you to
be grateful so far as i can see a man
who wouldnt stick with his wife wouldnt
be much

   are you here just because of that

   well maybe not altogether of course
id be here anyhow i wouldnt go back on
no woman who belonged to me but you
aint just that exactly ive somehow got
to thinkin a lot about you lately

   truly

   sure theres a heap o things happened
since we was lined up against the wall
of that shack down at ponca ive found
out more what you are than i knew then
an i reckon you got a better line on me

   i-i chose you even then

  he laughed awkwardly

   out o that bunch i dont take that
as no great compliment say that was the
orniest lot o cattle i ever rode herd over
 oh i dont know her mood changing
into new interest  there were some among
them not so bad anyhow i chose you

   maybe youre sorry since

   i am not -firmly  i nevef have been
see here tom shelby i pretty near knew
what sort of man you was when i selected
you your face told me that you thought
i just took you so as to get away well
maybe i did in a sense for i would have
done almost anything to escape from that
life but i never would have gone with
you if i hadnt honestly liked you just the
same


all - sto r y weekly

   you did

  yes i did theres no reason i
shouldnt say so you said it in the cabin
there that you didnt marry me because
you knew  had money-that you had no
such knowledge was that true

   certainly

   then why did you marry me

  his face burning from the heat of the
near-by flames grew redder if possible with
embarrassment her eyes were gazing
straight at him insistent of an answer

   well i aint exactly sure that i know
he admitted reluctantly  maybe i sorter
sympathized with yer a bit an then i got
almighty mad at the way them fellows
acted all them things counted  reckon
but after i went back an talked with you
alone somehow i naturally felt different
i-i kinder got to wantin you myself

   i knew you did

   you knew but  never said nothing
like that

   no yet i felt the change  would
never have said yes otherwise you thought
me indifferent cold but the truth is i rode
out to your ranch with you that day secret-
ly happier than i have even been in my life
before

  olga his hand tightened upon hers
suddenly

   yes she went on her eyes now
lowered slightly concealed beneath the long
lashes  i am willing to tell you now per-
haps we shall never get out of this place
alive and i want to be honest with you
for once whatever happens i would rather
you knew

   but you cannot mean-
 it is exactly what  mean tom i
love you do you care

   care why olga girl  have done
nothing but care i hardly knew what it
all meant at first the way i thought of you
love came to me like a strange thing i
have led a mans life and i have known
few good women even now i cannot
wholly realize what has come to me

  he gathered her suddenly into his arms
the neckerchief slipping down about her
throat

   i love you  he whispered passionately
 love you wife of mine

   and i have given you my heart long
ago kiss me tom

  they sat there closely pressed together
in that narrow space scarcely aware any
longer of the danger at hand eager only to
hear each others voices the flames just
beyond them died down slightly yet re-
mained red and angry occasionally shooting
up in fiery billows lighting their faces
the hole beneath the trap was a mass of
embers totally blocked with charred and
blazing wood above the crackle of the
flames and the crashing of falling tim-
bers they could distinguish the intermit-
tent crack of a rifle and the echo of voices
calling shelby began to dig with one hand
at the pile of earth beside him so as to
widen the space between its summit and
the roof the action caused his mind to
revert to the imminent peril of their situa-
tion

  it will be all over with before day-
light he said soberly  and that will be
our chance to get out we can never go
the other way for those logs will hold fire
for hours yet

   how do you suppose macklin ever got
through there she questioned wonder-
ingly

   thats what bothers me either he
wasnt much hurt or hejiad help it is
my notion the girl brought him out in
some way the shooting was an act of sud-
den anger for which she was sorry the very
next moment they may be hiding there
now somewhere in the tunnel

  she lifted herself up and peered through
the opening the glare of the flames did
not penetrate beyond the barrier of earth
and she saw nothing but impenetratable
blackness

   shall we go and see

   not yet we are safer here until those
devils give up you can hear their voices
yet out there

  they had no way of telling time and
the hours dragged the flames sank but
the glow of the coals remained and the
litter of charred logs occasionally flaring
into tiny spits of fire the sound of firing
had entirely ceased and the shouts of voices
died away one after the other the had
been very close at one time as though the
comrades of peril



baffled savages were endeavoring to invade
the smouldering ruins of the cabin to learn
the fate of their victims but the heat must
have prevented any search for the party
drifted away and did not return shelby
waited patiently listening for the slightest
sound but at last could restrain himself
no longer

   i do not know how late it is he said
finally  yet it must be nearly morning
most of those fellows must be gone shall
we try our luck little girl

  she put her hand silently into his

the fugitives

he led the way finding little difficulty
in crawling over the mound of earth
and olga followed easily the cool
darkness into  which they advanced was a
great relief while the sense of action re-
stored their shattered nerves no gleam
of light gave any guidance nor was there
any evidence of immediate approach to the
mouth of the tunnel however it ran near-
ly straight with the grade constantly down-
ward and they could cautiously feel a way
forward with hands on the earth walls

  they encountered no further obstruction
of any kind but suddenly reached a sharp
turn toward the left shelby felt his pas-
sage around the corner aware of the pres-
sure of olgas fingers on his sleeve but his
eyies could perceive nothing unusual be-
yond he stared helplessly into a black
soundless void yet with his first step for-
ward he came to a sudden halt

   stay where you are sehor said a low
voice  not a move till i speak

  he caught his breath quickly scarcely
daring to set down an uplifted foot there
was no doubt who it was that spoke out
of the darkness

 but i am shelby he blurted forth
swiftly  you have no reason to fear me
 shelby how came you here you
found the trap and-and is she with
you

   yes sehorita an accident revealed to
us a way out it was you then who took
macklin away was he not killed

  a moment there was silence then she
broke out suddenly passionately the words
fairly falling over each other in her eager-
ness of expression

   i am not afraid senor shelby no
no i have ze pistol in my hand i shoot
the dark eet make no difference for you

ward quick just when i fire he drop an i

  shelby felt olga grip him and heard her
voice at his ear

   she never heard what macklin said
dont let her know


all-story weekly

  he crushed the question already on his
lips back into his throat

 yes he said  i see how it happened
now and what did you do then pancha
she was not sobbing but her quick
breathing gave the impress in the darkness

   what i do seiior i pray the virgin
that i may save him then i remember
this passage from the ravine how i know
eet juan and i we live in the cabin a
month twas then i found eet who made
eet i know not but the thought come to
me just so  was underneath when you
fought seiior then when you were both
outside i got heem-

 macklin you mean he was alive
 yes seiior alive maybe he live may-
be he die i know not i do what i can
he help a little but twice he faint it took
long time even i carried heem alone

   but how did you get across that cave-in
of earth

   eet was not there eet come later she
explained  i would go back seiior when
they fired the cabin but the earth had
caved and i could not get through

   to help us

   si seiior to help you and me what
could i do alone that is why i tell you
why i talk eet is not for you nor for me
i would save heem an only can it be done
if i have help i do all i can-merciful
mother yes i bind up the wound i hold
heem while he sleep i bring heem water
from the creek i hide heem here in the
dark but how i get heem out seiior

   but why not call the others shelby
asked suddenly in suspicion  what dan-
ger is macklin in

  you know not-in surprise he
did not say in the cabin why he came

   who do you mean

   senor laud he make no threat

   certainly not against whom

   seiior macklin he come for that i
know the indian boy told me-he an
hanley they plan it all out twas be-
cause juan would not be one with them
they keel heem they would hold her for
ransom they say a man comes soon here
who would pay much so they try to put
out of the way seiior macklin tis to
get her that slagin go to the cabin he

fail and then senor laud try another way
he not know when he come that senor
macklin get back no one know

  shelby smothered an oath the whole foul
plot suddenly revealed to him in all its
hideousness this then was what these
fiends had been planning it was plot within 
plot criminal against criminal he was
blind not to have perceived the truth be-
fore now it stood before him in all its
sheer nakedness macklins drunken boast
had brought forth its full brood hanley
too brainless and cowardly to lead had told
all he knew to indian joe-embellished it
no doubt-and it was just the sort of thing
the latter was eager to get his hands into-
seemingly a safe game with a good stake

  the girl was helpless already in their
power all they needed to do was dispose
of macklin how this was done no one
cared by bribery by the knife in the
hole who would ever ask questions who
would mourn the fellow whatever hap-
pened and then they would have a free
hand shelby reached out and drew olga
closer to him in the darkness

   i understand now he said tersely

 weve got to fight this out together all
right im ready what is it you want me
to do

   you will help me save heem the voice
from the dark asked eagerly  you will
not try to go away alone senor

   no we are in the same boat it seems
well help each other you trust me now
pancha

    si seiior

   then lets see what can be done can
macklin walk

   no seiior i think maybe he verra bad
off he not speak now for long time may-
be you tell what we do for heem

   im afraid not pancha ive doctored
some wounds but im no expert where is
he lying oh here

  he bent down in the dark and touched
the motionless figure the mans flesh was
warm from fever doubtless and his breath-
ing was unusually heavy his fingers sought
the mans pulse which showed weak but
rapid

   where was the wound

   in the right chest seiior
comrades - peril



   and you have washed and bandaged
it

   yes senor the best i could  tore up
my underskirt

   do you know if he bled much

   not since i found heem-no eet was
very little before i think yes there was
a pool of blood on the floor in which he
lay her voice trembled  you think
maybe he live senor

   i am unable to answer that pancha
he replied soberly rising to his feet  the
man is evidently hard hit weak from loss
of blood and in a coma now from fever
this is no place for him if we could get
him out into the open bandage his wound
properly and get a doctor to probe for the
ball he might have a fair chance i can
say no more than that

   a doctor where would there be a
doctor

   i know of none this side of gerlasche
an army surgeon is at the camp there no
doubt he would come

   gerlasche and-and he could save
heem senor

   he might i can promise nothing but
that would be the only hope

   but you will help me you pledge
that

   i will do whatever i can shelby said
earnestly  i hardly know how we are go-
ing to manage it still macklin is not very
big or heavy and while he is bound to
be a dead weight  am sure i could carry
him for a while once outside we might
find some poles rig up a litter and so get
along the three of us

   yes interposed olga sympathetically
 we must do that if possible he cannot
be left to die alone in this horrible place
 am strong and will help all i can could
we not start at once

   just a moment is there an entrance
not far away pancha

   not fifty feet senor

   then we ought to hear any firing or
shouting without everything seems quiet
it must be nearly morning and the indians
have probably scattered believing us
burned in the cabin lets make the effort
now

  he sent the mexican girl on in advance

and lifted the unconscious macklin upon
his back olga partially supporting the help-
less body the wounded man groaned at
the first movement but lapsed immediately
into silence again and shelby moved slowly
forward with his burden along the dark nar-
row passage it terminated in a small hole
well protected by a covert of brush through
which the fellow had to be drawn cau-
tiously

  once on the outside under the cold gleam
of the stars they found themselves pro-
tected by the high banks of a gully that
turned sharply to the left connecting with a
deeper ravine the night was solemnly
still with a slight glow to the sky overhead
as though day was about to dawn the
three clustered close and listened but no
sound broke the stillness satisfied they
were not observed shelby again picked up
the wounded man and with pancha guid-
ing her figure barely discernible in the
gloom slowly advanced down the depres-
sion

  it was hard slow work as shelby had to
carefully pick his way among the stones
seeking a safe resting-place for each foot
they must move noiselessly the slightest
misstep might arouse alarm as some of the
savages might be lurking anywhere in that
darkness their only hope lay in the con-
fidence the indians felt in their death with-
in the cabin if they were assured as to
this then they had probably scattered will-
ing to wait until morning to search the
debris for their bodies but this they
couldnt know

  as they turned into the ravine they ob-
tained a glimpse of the burned cabin one
wall yet stood ragged against the sky and
there was a gleam of red embers occa-
sionally a gust of air sent sparks flying up-
ward and spirals of black smoke were visi-
ble no moving forms could be perceived
however about the ruins and it was evident
the spot was still in a condition to render
exploration impossible

  huddled closely together in the shelter
of the rocks the fugitives stared across
the open space at the red gleam shelby
clinging to his burden felt the tightening
pressure of olgas hand as she nervously
touched him the mexican girl had lifted


all-story weekly

herself upon a projecting stone and was
searching the shadows with keen eyes

   where do we go he questioned and
she instantly turned her head at the low
murmur of his voice

   up the rock trail senor there is no
other safe place

   so i thought then we must get under
cover before daylight dawn is not far
off from the looks of the sky he paused
suddenly  what kind of a looking guy is
hanley

   he tall scrawny red whiskers

   then i got him plugged the fellow
through the arm he wont want any more
for a while come lets move on he
added impatiently  its doing no good
to remain here and stare at that fire and
it is no light load ive got on my back
the way was a rough one strewn with
stones but well protected by high banks
on either side pancha seemingly knew
every inch of it for she advanced confident-
ly selecting the easier path the light from
the slowly graying sky overhead scarcely
penetrated the depths of the ravine yet
shelby could follow her figure and toiled
steadily forward bending low under his un-
conscious burden so they came to the end
of the cleft where it terminated at the bank
of the creek

chapter xxvi

the security of the cave

the events of the next hour remained
in shelbys mind more like some ter-
rible dream than a remembrance he
was conscious of being excessively worn
hungry tired his mind did not function
yet he clung doggedly to his task with teeth
clenched and every muscle aching from the
effort his load grew heavier with every
step and at times he stumbled like a drunk-
en man through sheer weakness macklin
moaned once or twice but without regain-
ing consciousness and twice shelby felt
compelled to lay the wounded man on the
ground while he regained sufficient strength
to proceed once they endeavored to shift
the burden olga insisting on helping him
to bear the man but this proved imprac-

ticable and again shelby shouldered the
body and staggered blindly up-stream

  the sky was gray a heavy mist shroud-
ing the valley below when they finally
attained the opening into the trail sought
nothing could be seen of their enemies
and convinced that as yet there was no
pursuit the three crept breathlessly into
the shadow of the bushes dragging the un-
conscious macklin with them for some
minutes shelby lay motionless struggling
for breath feeling that all strength had
deserted him he scarcely realized that
olga had lifted his head into her lap and
was wiping the beads of perspiration from
his face at last however his eyes opened
and he saw her bending over him the
mans lips broke into an effort to smile

   some soft aint i little girl he mut-
tered  but gee that was a pull and i
was about all in wheres pancha

   back there where she can look out
is it much further

   to the cave you mean yes it is a
hard climb yet but we will have it easier
ill be all right presently well cut some
stakes and make a litter no one can see
us from below the rest of the way

   i dont know what is the matter with
me he apologized ashamed of his weak-
ness  hungry and overstrained i guess
that was about the hardest job i ever
tackled maybe i ought to have left the
fellow there

  oh no tom we couldnt do that
the poor thing is nearly crazed

   pancha yes i know but shed be a
heap sight better off with the guy dead
he has only been playing with her

   but she will not believe that she
thinks it is all her fault and-and she is
such a wild passionate little thing i would
do anything to save him for her

   there is about one chance in a thou-
sand still hes just about ornery enough
to make it we sure dont owe him any-
thing

   i am- not certain of that she said
softly  i wonder when i would have
known my husband but for him

   you said that almost as though you
meant it

   do i not what do my eyes say
comrades of peril



   they are very happy they are not the
same eyes i saw first in pancha

 they never will be the same eyes again
they see a very different world i doubt if
you half believe all i confess to you now
 i can scarcely realize it is true but be-
lief is not absent

  the motionless girl at the end of the rock
suddenly turned her head and glanced back
at them

   seiior is it true that you love her-
your wife

   true of course pancha i told you
so even before i told her

   an she love you

   i am senor shelbys wife pancha
spoke up olga quickly a flush burning red
on her cheeks  i have no other ambition
 but the money you rich he say
that senor macklin you not even care
for that

   not very much-no  know nothing
about it and am perfectly content if it never
comes you must know what i mean-you
have loved

   yes seiior i have loved and would still
love money is nothing seiior-

   yes pancha

   i think as i lie here what it was best
to do they stir down there  cannot see
yet for the fog but i hear sounds pretty
soon they will know perhaps yet they
will not be able to tell what has happened
we come here unseen they know nothing
of me nothing of seiior macklin but they
hunt the burned cabin an find no bone no
flesh what will they do

  laud will suspect the truth he is a
fox

   tis so perhaps yet  believe we left
no trail seiior it was all rock an water
even the sioux cannot follow that you
know the way now

   to the cave-yes

   it is safe but if the seiior lives he
must have a doctor you tell me that and
there is but one way i must ride

  shelby straightened up instantly grasp-
ing her purpose

   you mean you will leave us here to go
on alone

   yes senor it is best they will noi
stop me they will not know ltnless i meet

senor laud there is no danger perhaps
even he will nofesuspect or interfere there
are horses there and i ride often-some-
times even up onto the mesa no one will
care what i do is not that the best way
seiior

   you are sure you can pass

   i am sure i will pass she said firmly
 i ride for hees life seiior

  it was the better plan nor could shelby
deny the probability of its success she was
trusted by that wild crew of white and red
renegades she had been one of them no
one unless possibly it might be laud or
hanley had any reason to suspect her now
it was a long journey to gerlasche too long
to be made on foot and if the girl went with
them up the trail every effort at rescue
would be delayed she had chosen the one
quick course to pursue

   you are right pancha he admitted
 well get him up there some way but
you better go now before the fog rises

   yes senor

  she came over and knelt beside macklin
who was moaning slightly his head resting
on a pillow made by shelbys coat his
face appeared drawn and haggard in the
weird gray light as she bent over him
his eyes partially opened but with no light
of intelligence in them they were dull
lusterless

   seiior senor she sobbed pressing his
hand between both her own   am going
to ride for you

  some angel of mercy must have put the
words on his lips for certainly he knew
her not yet faint fitful there came from
his lips the cry

   pancha i want you pancha

  she must have understood known and
yet the comfort of that call was hers

  she looked at him dry-eyed motionless
then bent and kissed his lips slowly re-
gretfully she arose to her feet and faced
them her cheeks white

   tis all she said simply  now i go
she vanished without a sound gliding
through the fringe of bushes and down the
steep bank to the protection of the creek
once they caught glimpse of her below but
only to lose sight once more among the
swirling clouds of vapor which yet con-

cealed the lower valley they were alone
but with their own work to do shelby
went at his with quiet efficiency the
sooner they were on their way the better
but he had already planned the easier meth-
od by which he meant to transport the
wounded man

  selecting two stout limbs similar in size
and length he ran these through the arms
of his stout corduroy jacket binding them
into position by two cross-pieces hastily
prepared and lashed firmly with strips torn
from his neckerchief macklin was now
lifted gently onto the outspread coat his
limbs upheld by one of the cross-bars
and then the jacket buttoned securely about
him forming a swinging cradle finely
adapted for the purpose shelby straight-
ened up quite himself again

   there that will answer nicely he said
confidently  it is bound to be a hard
climb but well take our time to it and
rest when we are tired no one can see us
from below after we once pass the point
yonder

   is the trail up-hill all the way asked
the girl her eyes searching the steep face
of the bluff

   yes pretty sharp at times but well
manage it follows a deep cleft through the
rocks and once found cannot be lost ill
take this end that will give me the most
of the weight and you lead the way take it
slowly and youll be all right

  they picked the litter up between them
olga relieved to discover how lightly thus
distributed her share of the burden rested
upon her she was able to advance easily
and pick her way among the rocks without
experiencing great discomfort the weight
of the mans body came far heavier upon
shelby but the rest and change had largely
restored his strength and he felt no doubt
of his ability to sustain his end of the bur-
den unable to see just where he was plac-
ing his feet in the stony path he stumbled
occasionally causing the wounded man to
gioan in some sudden spasm of pain yet
it was evident he did not suffer greatly
the trail they followed had so impressed
itself on his memory he recalled every turn
clearly and could call out directions to her
in a low voice

   turn sharply to the right there we will
have to hold the litter higher to get by
that rock here is the only point exposed
once in the shadow of those trees the way
is completely covered yes we can move
rapidly around this point from now on
there are rocks on both sides take it easy
and if you need to rest say so

  the burden grew perceptibly heavier as
they toiled upward and several times they
put macklin down while they flung them-
selves on the rocks to regain breath for a
fresh effort the altitude began to effect
olga her heart beating rapidly from exer-
tion but she struggled on determined not
to yield shelby noting the whiteness of
her face insisted on frequent periods of rest
so that they were over an hour in attaining
the rock platform abutting on the cave

  getting macklins helpless body over that
last high stone rampart proved to be the
most difficult task of all and was only ac-
complished by sheer strength shelby hang-
ing downward with limbs braced against
the rock and slowly drawing the inert body
up by the muscles of his arms assisted to
some extent by the efforts of the girl be-
neath once safely behind the cover of the
stone parapet they lay panting with ex-
haustion

  however this was a bodily weariness
soon ministered unto shelby refusing to
let olga attempt any more drew the wound-
ed man back into the greater security of the
cave and made him as comfortable as pos-
sible then although still breathing heav-
ily himself he hastily gathered together
what food remained from his store of the
day before and took this out to share with
her they sat in the open just outside
the narrow entrance to the cave where by
lifting their heads they could look over the
parapet into the deep chasm of the valley

  it had begun to snow in large swirling
flakes thickly enough to blot out complete-
ly the scene beneath leaving them perched
high above its vortex as though they lived
in another world the white curtain gave
them a sense of isolation of security which
helped immeasurably to restore their cour-
age they were beyond all probability of
pursuit free from immediate peril shut off
from any discovery
censored



  all that remained was to wait patiently
the return of pancha with help the wind
kept the platform-free from snow hurling it
down into the deep gorge powdering the
trail they had just traveled and thus com-
pletely obliterating any signs of their pas-
sage yet the gray gloom weighed heavily
on the girl

 how long will it take her she asked
 pancha oh she can hardly get back
before late to-night it is a hard ride even
if she meets with no accident my only
fear is she may encounter laud

   you do not think she will attempt to
return alone

   not if she brings the doctor  said
nothing for i did not believe it necessary
he will never venture into this hole without
an escort and a reasonably strong one 
am hoping she encounters some party out
scouting which will make a trip to gerlasche
unnecessary since the fight out yonder
troops must be searching the bad lands for
renegade indians they would only be
too glad to discover some guide who would
lead them here

   but surely they know of this place

   they know of it yes in a way they
possess full information as to its existence
but to get in here is quite another matter
without a competent guide they might hunt
for weeks and if they did discover the trail
through some accident the game would be
gone only a sudden dash will ever round
that outfit up they will have to be hit
front and rear and with no small force

  he looked out into the cloud of snow
seeking vainly to penetrate the curtain

   the lord only knows how many savage
devils there are down there now he said
soberly  i dont think there was much
of a bunch when i first came in-mostly
white outlaws cattle-thieves and scum of
that kind but since the fight indians have
been coming a slue of em young bucks
who got away theyll be desperate and
crazed what was that that noise

   it came from the cave perhaps it was
macklin

  they were both upon their feet startled
by the strange sound shelby bent down
and crept in through the entrance

that you will get the conclusion of this story without waiting a month

censor  did not like his job it
was bad enough that a leg broken
by football kept him out of active
service but to sit at a desk doing womans
work was adding insult to injury heads
of departments however are seldom open
to conviction and  was kept on his job

at first he had hailed the change from
pure routine work which he had been doing

with enthusiasm at least he thought he
would experience the glory of war at second
hand and he pictured himself a welcome
guest retailing incidents and events spiced
with the real flavor of gunpowder and the
added interest of mystery  of course he
fancied himself saying  i cant tell the
place where it happened or the name of the
boat but- and he saw his auditors nod-


all-story weekly

ding approval and hanging on his words in
breathless suspense

   his first mornings work brought the rude
realization that it was outgoing mail he was
to handle-letters from the land of peace
and prosperity to those in the service
abroad the news contained was purely
personal and the only knowledge he gained
was that of the eternal monotony of human
nature

   after a weeks work he subdivided all let-
ters mentally into  male  and  female 
classes the former written by members
of either sex were in the minority they
were brief but usually required a lot of
censoring for they persisted in giving the
whereabouts of  good old bill and the
sixty-first or stating well-authenticated
rumors about peace negotiations and the
end of the war the female class he sub-
divided into  mothers sweethearts or
wives  letters and could easily place them
by certain stereotyped phrases that they al-
ways contained

  the first asked solicitously about food
and underwear and- my darling boy
who darns your socks the second had
usually some sort of an apology to himself
 i know the censor will see this but no
censor in the world will keep me from telling
you how much i love you and then
casually tucked away somewhere near the
end are the french girls so very pretty
the wives letters told of purely domestic
adventures and were the most drearily
monotonous of all

  so  was righteously indignant at the
departmental injustice that hid his light
under the bushel of red tape and kept a
man of initiative at a task that any fool
could fill one day out of a clear sky
came a letter-so different from the rest
so clear and refreshing in tone that despite
the ennui that comes from repletion 
found time to read it again and envy the
lucky fellow to whom it was sent

   it began

my dearest better half

   yes i had my bad quarter of an hour yester-
day when your train pulled out everything
looked black and gloomy when i left the station
and for five minutes i didnt love god and the
birds sang awful all of a sudden i remembered
the little package you tucked in my hand at the

last moment and i opened it to find your dear
old face smiling up at me i never could resist
your smile so i smiled back through my tears
then the sun came out and the birds sang and
i shrugged my shoulders and said aloud  cest
la guerre to the amazement of the station porter
who i am sure would have called a bellevue
ambulance had i lingered longer in his vicinity
so i powdered my nose and pursued my way in
-peace

   here was a change from the eternal same-
 ness of things he had just come to the
 conclusion that all human beings lived and
 thought just alike and there was nothing
 new under the sun when from out of the
 mass of innane correspondence which sur-
 rounded him this letter appeared he read
 it again examined the handwriting-clear
 legible bold looked at the address- lieu-
 tenant c e gravely lucky dog had
 his commission and gone across of course
 girls are crazy about uniforms  girl
 why thought   shes his wife calls
 him her better-half i wonder how long
 theyve been married and he fell into such
 a brown study that the man at the next desk
 asked whats the matter dalton found
 a new cipher code dalton only shook his
 head and sighed

   that week brought two more letters in
 the same tone one gave a sprightly de-
 scription of a red cross bazaar

   all sorts of garnets surely made for sur-
 vivors of the battlefield not for the general
 public were on display at least thats how
 they looked for they were fearfully and wonder-
 fully fashioned some were evidently made for
 giants some looked as if they might fit the
 class of  if they were called soon one wo-
 man actually sent a sweater with one sleeve
 maybe she ran out of wool but i call it carrying
 preparedness to an extreme eh handkerchiefs
 as big as a postage stamp of no earthly use to
 any one with a decent-sized cold were sold by
 frisky fluff of the follies for five dollars each
 men came to blows literally and figuratively
 over them one old organ-grinder came in with
 a new dollar bill  to buy a liberty bomb for the
 germans

   censor dalton smiled and then frowned
 over the following

   went for a long tramp yesterday old top all
 on my lonesome but i made believe you were
 with me and took the old aqueduct road do
 you remember our last hike there the time we
 were lost-two babes in the woods-and went
 dinneriess until nightfall every one we met said
 the village was a quarter of a mile further on

 till we felt as if we were on a treadmill or chasing
 a mirage they were the good old palm days
 werent they now youre treading strange
 paths perhaps well look at everything twice
 once for yourself and once for me

  what fellow wouldnt like a girl like
that dalton pictured her-tall slender
athletic so different from the writers of
those other letters they were silly gush-
ing schoolgirls or sentimental old maids
most of them  jolliers thats what they
were the letter in his hand however had
plenty of affection in it it was warm and
alive but there was a certain restraint a
little reticence that only added zest to what
was really expressed doubtless gravely
could read much between the lines at the
thought dalton grabbed his pencil and sav-
agely pounced on the next letter ready to
wreck his censorial wrath on the first in-
nocuous sentence he came across

  three days went by with no more of
these letters and it seemed to dalton that
those which passed through his hands were
more deadly dreary than ever he began
to worry lest the looked-for blue envelope
with the uncompromising bold chirography
had gone through some other channel then
he caught sight of it in the morning mail
and the tremendous heart-beat that followed
his discovery made him pause and consider

   am i crazy he thought  going mad
over the letters of a womsr that ive never
seen most likely shes old and scrawny
and-well shes married anyway

  a censor should be a machine gosh
he knew all that but a fellow was only
human somehow these letters had taken a
hold on his imagination the style was so
interesting that is he was interested from
a purely literary point of view having
thus salved his conscience he tore open the
envelope fcnd while the rest of the mail lay
undisturbed he read it once-again

dear old thing

  of course i miss you mother nrsses you the
cat misses you but whats the use saying so
you should have known better than to ask us if
we did cause we dont want to tell you that
we want to tell you the news and if there isnt
any news im going to make some up so you
neednt believe anything i write unless you want
to

  i started to school again yesterday and it cer-
tainly is good to be back on the job one must

     a-s

keep busy nowadays no time for thought thats
the best plan the kids seem glad to see me
again i have one adorable little italian who
cant speak english her name as far as  could
understand it is  kawky so  asked in an
effort to elucidate what does mother call you
and she replied  mam she say kaw-kee-ee
you lill dam fool kaw-kee-ee

  brave thats what she is thought
dalton  grit clear through gone to work
and making the best of it no she cant
be old i wonder where she lives he
looked at the envelope and tucked in the
corner was the return address- m e
gravely  south boulevard larchfield

  larchfield was a little suburb not far
away he had passed through it many
times and he remembered its flower-hung
porches and neat trimmed lawns was her
home like that he tried to picture it and
then he began to wonder what she looked
like was she light or dark tall or short
one thing he was sure of her eyes would
be bright and smiling but why conjecture
he shook his shoulders as if to shake off
the thought of her-a woman he had never
met never could meet but no matter what
he tried to do mary gravely-her name
her fancied face or a phrase from her letter
would keep popping up at the most inoppor-
tune moments

  in the days that followed the infatuation
seemed to grow if he walked in a crowd
it was to scan each face and figure to won-
der if she looked like that if he heard a
cheerful laugh he wheeled and stared rudely
at the perpetrator thinking  her laugh
would sound like that he wanted to be
alone he wanted to think of her there
was no doubt about it the woman ob-
sessed him he began to think of her
day and night to dream of her to envy the
lieutenant-almost to hate him

  the cheerful tone of the letters continued
even parties were mentioned

  only women were there because all the men
worth while in our crowd have gone across

  then one day he ran across a bit of
jingle invaluable for the information that it
conveyed to him

            my hair is still red

              my eyes are still blue

          best of all my dear-

               i still love you


all-story weekly

  now he had something definite to go on
he stared at every red-headed woman he
met but none of them came up to his idea
of her and he decided that probably she
seldom came to town one day the wild
idea of a trip to larchfield took possession
of him he persuaded himself that he
needed more exercise and was sick of the
city streets he took the short-train trip
and soon found himself in the little village
street signs interested him strangely and
his heart gave an inexplicable bounce when
he saw on one  boulevard south he
glanced at numbers on the houses-  
he read then   and without giving
himself any reason for his preference he
crossed the street and began walking in the
opposite direction

  up ran the numbers - as they
increased so did his gait and respiration
he passed -- then stopped
short there it was -  a quaint
little stucco house with love-in-a-mist and
clematis climbing all over the little porch
just the sort of home he would have im-
agined hers to be then feeling that his
standing still might be conspicuous al-
though there were few passers-by on this
quiet sunday afternoon he walked to the
further end of the block turned and slowly
retraced his steps in passing by he scanned
the windows they were shut and all the
blinds were drawn tight the place had a
silent not-at-home appearance his heart
stood still what could have happened
he hurried back to town thinking of all
sorts of horrible possibilities-sickness or
worse he couldnt read or eat and when
he went to bed he tossed sleepless through
the entire night

  next morning he rose at daybreak and
was in his office before the scrub-woman
had finished her matutinal job he hung
around the corridors smoking cigarette
after cigarette he greeted the well-meant
inquiries of his colleagues with a curt ex-
planation of insomnia and nervousness the
good-natured jesting that answered him
only made him the more irritable finally
however the mail was distributed and the
next moment found him sorting it with
feverish eagerness that ceased the moment
his fingers touched the familiar blue en-

velope he opened it quickly and a smile
of relief covered his face as he read

  we are going to spend every week-end with
maude now it will he a change for me and a
relief for mother

  dalton sat back and called himself a fool
and other appropriate epithets but he was
so happy the tension had been so great
that he hadnt the heart to reprove himself
for his folly he determined however to
make no more trips of investigation but to
confine his attention solely to the letters
which surely could do no harm

  this went on serenely for a few weeks
and then the letter to lieutenant gravely
was addressed  base hospital  he
was ill with an attack of trench-fever and
the anguish the longing in each line wrung
daltons heart there was a pitiful effort
to be brave but through it all rang the
protest against separation she wrote

  oh my dearest im not afraid for you i
know youll get well but i want to be with you
to sit beside you and fan you and turn your
pillow i know its selfish of me for you are
probably taken care of in a better way than mine
but i want to be with you-oh so much

  the next days letter contained an en-
closure that dalton would have given a
years salary to keep it was the photo-
graph of a bright-faced happy-looking girl
of about twenty and across its back was
written  your marys come to keep you
company thereupon censor  did an
unheard of unprofessional thing he wrote
a letter of his own to the lieutenant ex-
plaining that he had heard of lieutenant
gravelys illness but not saying how he
inquired as to the officers health ana com-
mended him to a friend of his who was a
physician in base hospital  then
dalton wrote to the doctor and asked his
special services for the sick man after
both letters were duly stamped and mailed
he sat back and alternately cursed himself
for a fool and thanked his lucky stars for
the chance that enabled him to render her
a service

  answers came from both patient and
physician the former contained the wel-
come and unwelcome news that he was
being invalided home
censored



   i am leaving to-morrow and i can never
forget your kindness my unknown friend
gravely wrote

   i live very near your city was the
superfluous information  and i hope that
some time you will call and enable me to
thank you in person

  first dalton told himself that he had bet-
ter stay away then that it was churlish not
to go

  the next day a belated letter from her
settled the question she wrote

   ill be so glad to have you back and my heart
is jumping for joy with every beat im
so glad you were sick gladder that you are
better gladdest of all that you will be unfit for
service for a while and we can be together again
am i a pig no only a fond and foolish woman
how wonderful everything has been think of a
perfect stjanger being so nice to you who is that
mr dalton he said he had heard of you but
did not mention the name of your mutual friend
anyway im sure hes very nice and you must
see and thank him when you are home

  on reading this dalton straightway
mounted to the seventh heaven of delight
until impatience brought him back to earth
thereafter he besieged the war department
daily for information as to the day and hour
of lieutenant gravelys return and found
out for the first time how well the govern-
ment guards its secrets no one could or
would tell him when and where transports
with wounded men were due to arrive so he
had to draw his own conclusions he cal-
culated that it would take two weeks to get
over one week for recuperation and then
he yielded entirely and wrote to congratu-
late the lieutenant on his return and ask
him when he could receive visitors

  an immediate reply showed him he was
welcome but now the days dragged sure-
ly there were seventy days in the week and
each was forty-eight hours long till sunday
came finally he stood in front of 
s boulevard-and his heart failed him
 journeys end in lovers meetings but his
alas must end in-nothing it was the end
of a dream the little path in front of him
led to the door of disillusionment the odor
of the late roses seemed funereal

  he feared his visit would lead to ques-
tions then must come explanations but
no one need know of his day-dreams he

could say how he admired marys wifely de-
votion how sorry he felt for the separation
of so devoted a couple hed rub that in
so they would never suspect his ulterior
motive so he squared his shoulders and
walked bravely to the threshold the little
tinkle of the bell had hardly died away
when the door opened and there she stood

  more radiant more alive more vivid
than his brightest dreams curling red
hair bright blue eyes all of her radiated
vitality his head swam he reached for
the door-jamb and grasping it managed to
gasp  lieutenant gravely

  yes-do come in mr dalton isnt
it

  dalton nodded

   hes expecting you the pleasant voice
continued  in here please and she
opened the door

  mechanically dalton hung up his hat and
followed and then for the second time his
senses almost forsook him there in a long
chair before him was a tall very thin young
man very very thin very pale but-his
hair was red and curly his eyes were blue
and bright and in spite of his evident
weakness he was very much alive he
stretched out a thin hand to dalton and
said

   oh mr dalton excuse my not getting
up im still a bit of an invalid then
waving a hand toward her he said  meet
my sister miss gravely daltons lew re-
maining senses immediately left him and
he could only hold tightly to the hand she
extended and stare and stare he never
heard the pretty grateful speech she made
to him he stood in embarrassed silence
till lieutenant gravely broke in

   let him sit down sis i want to talk
too you see he added  we always want
to do the same thing at the same time
being twins

   yes laughed mary  i call him my
better-half

  and though dalton was to make the
most important speech of his life in that
very room several weeks later his first re-
mark was exactly two words but they burst
the restraint of months and sounded in his
ears like a ptean of thanksgiving

   i understand he said
h h grinstead

old jim rudisill had been a
long time on the rio grande he
owned a ranch of ten thousand acres
that lay in a bend on the texas side the
river ran west on his northern boundary
line and farther south it turned east to
mark the southern limit of his possessions
so that he had mexico on three sides of
him

  the mexicans may have looked longingly
toward the fat cattle and swift-gaited
horses but they had never dared make a
raid across the shifting channel the old
ranchman was noted for his averseness to
parting with his money

   no ill be dadburned if i buy any
liberty bonds he had exclaimed once
when approached on the subject  pro-
tection thunder i can hold my own right
across there among the greasers-wouldnt
care if i was on that side if ive got to have
the life pestered out of me here

  at sundown of a day in early spring pink
rogers the ranch foreman rode up

   rivers risin he announced briefly

   that so the ranch owner queried with
little interest  too late for a big rise 
reckon

  too late or not it was a big rise before
dark the river was almost bank-full

  the next morning water covered the low
ground a mile to the east of the ranch-
house cutting its way across the neck of
land to the river where it turned back like
a horseshoe the rudisill ranch was on an
island

  before night the river began to fall and

twenty-four hours later was almost down
to normal stage but the new channel it had
cut across the bend remained full jim
rudisill saddled his horse and rode to the
west here he found a huge sand-bar
blocking the old channel down which
flowed a trickle of water that might have
been crossed at a step

  the rudisill ranch was in mexico
well by heck old jim muttered
 its a fool law that makes the channel of
a river the boundary line but i guess i
dont care taxes will be lower maybe
old jim rudisill was at dinner three days
later when a dozen mexican rurales rode
up to the gate the alert captain of the
soldiers knew his business which he kept
to himself until after he had dinner

   it is the customs duty senor the
officer imparted graciously as he rolled his
after-dinner cigarette  you have the cat-
tle  think two thousand and of horses
perhaps a hundred i am sent to collect the
duty that must be paid when you bring
them into mexico

   the devil and tom walker old jim
exploded  you dont think i tried to
smuggle over a whole ranch it aint my
fault if im in your measly old republic
 it is the law senor i cannot say
your cattle and horses were in the estados
unidos now they are in mexico the duty
must be paid

  oh come now old jim wheedled
 how about a hundred pesos for you and
the same for the alcalde i know him-
manuel chaves
tribute	

  no senor chaves was a cientifko
and has been executed a long time now
remember there is no bribery the military
now rules-we protect you and the young
mexican drew himself up proudly

  i am ordered to take diezmo from the
cattle and horses if the money is not paid
he explained

   jumpin jupiter take a tenth for
duty why confound it i never heard of
payin mor-e n a dollar a head either way
 that was when cattle were but ten
dollars a head-they are worth fifty and
more now as to the law it is too slow-
the military acts quickly

  in spite of all the threats and curses he
could utter in spanish and english sep-
arately and combined old jim witnessed
the departure of two hundred of his fattest
beeves and at least ten of his best horses
driven away by the shrewd young officer
and his command

  as if adding insult to injury the mexican
soldiery patrolled the bank of the new river
channel every day they allowed nothing
to be molested but commandeered such
horses as they needed paying the ranchman
his own price-in their worthless currency

  for the next three weeks jim rudisill
fumed and cursed he even threatened to
desert his ranch and move his cattle across
the river but the mild-mannered official
informed him one day that by special order
the military government had forbidden the
exportation of cattle for the present

  the river became a mere ribbon in the
broad sands the dry season was at hand
and one night the ranch wagon came in
with a load of supplies queer-looking
lumps showed in sacks of flour while a roll
of blankets was strangely heavy

   it was the willows on this bank that
started the trouble the foreman had con-
fided to his boss

  so for three days the men worked shear-
ing the growth from the bank at the turn
old jim rudisill apparently reconciled to
his change of allegiance began to build a
fence along the dry channel of the old river-
bed	

  some of the post-holes he dug deep be-
yond reason when the men worked late
queer-looking bundles as of short sticks

wrere planted with a cord leading outward
and hidden in the dry sand

  other deep holes were dug m the sand-
bar that had been cast up as a barrier to
the old channel and they too were filled
with mysterious packages

  the willow-brush had been weighted
down at the turn toward the new channel
and already the sand that had drifted over
them showed in the shallow water

  one night when pink rogers unsaddled
his horse at the corral he remarked

    rivers risin

  it was the summer rain and there would
be no more than a foot of water but it was
enough

  in the middle of the night the rangers
at their camp ten miles up the river heard
a dull rumble that might have been taken
for distant artillery the mexican rurales
from the other side of die rio grande
raised from their blankets and listened
five reports they counted then a blend as
of contending armies

  at daylight when they cautiously ap-
proached the river a widening stream of
muddy water coursed along the old chan-
nel cutting its way deeper and deeper into
the soft sand while a mountain of sand was
scattered on either side of the break that

   i am the deputy collector of customs

 i am willing to accept your inventory
of the stock you recently transferred from
mexico to the united states and you may
pay the import duties on that basis

   well ill be- for once in his life
old jim rudisill longed for a cuss word
strong enough to express his feelings
eekejyle jr

  as the plump virginia matron who was
his wife hit him with the dish-towel
v she said in her exasperation  go
way from me man then to astound
the powers above with this thing she ad-
dressed the kitchen rafters  thinking
she said  i have time to kiss a french-
man 

  the frenchman was himself after
twenty years the count still spoke of him
as the frenchman there was no other
to his face he was of course mr goslin
although he pronounced it with another
flavor and wrote it guesclin otherwise
there was not the least strangeness about
him he was a neighbor like anybody else
and a warmly esteemed one he might just
as well have been a virginian which shows
how used to him everybody was it was
even so eight years before when after
twelve years of light-hearted and prosper-
ous trucking in the rich norfolk sand he
married the daughter of the overlanded
farmer from whom he had rented and then
bought his first acres the event disturbed
no sensibilities of the native born besides
they had grown accustomed to the idea
sally fitz-hugh mcdowell had certainly
kept him dangling long enough

  he was dangling yet really so far as
concerned the thirst of his eager gallic
heart for turbulent oceans of affection at
twentv-seven sallv fitz was as stand-offish

with broom or mop as she had been at nine-
teen with fan or fish-rod so that mr gos-
lin nearing forty now and still mellowing
lugubriously perceived that there was a bit
of the old scotch in sally fitz to the
sunny frenchman ardent though forty she
was a dour bit holding down emotional re-
sponsiveness in her deep bosom as if it were
a paving-block why not a nosegay occa-
sionally and not forever the turnips of
life matrimony for mr goslin thus con-
tinued an adventure so often baffling hope
while rousing it anew he was in love with
his wife and thats the truth she kept on
being desirable and her growing ample only
made her more so even if there were chil-
dren ranging in size from her knees to
her waist - but they made her most so
those children the symbol of - and yet
that dish-towel

  ah the guile with which the poor
frenchman must needs angle for caresses
and then not get em in the present in-
stance for example he came in from the
rural delivery-box with the norfolk paper
there was serious news he told her she
thought it something about the campaign
for state-wide prohibition or maybe his last
shipment of potatoes had struck a glutted
market but no it was about serbia

   serbia she repeated in that tone
when one does not quite catch an unfamiliar
name
prince potentate or potato



     about the killing of the austrian crown
  prince he went on

    oh that she did remember reading
  about it the death of their sheriff who
  had a lingering illness would have been
  more of a sensation  what you want to
  fool me for joe at first i supposed one
  of the neighbors must have broken a leg
  or something serious news humph
  serbia if that was the name could be in
  the moon no chain of circumstances was
   possibly long enough to link it with any
  personal interest for a james river truck-
  ers wife

     the de-fickle-ty said mr goslin
  gravely-there were a half-dozen words of
  the english that he never would get rolled
  out -  is here first there is austria
  which attacks serbia second there is rus-
  sia which thereupon must fight austria
  third germany fights russia-

     what ejaculated mrs goslin l all
  that for a dead dutchman

     no not yet all sal-lee he hastened
  on  for when germany fights russia
  then instantly france-la france ma-
  dame-

    sally fitz nodded  no you french-
  men wouldnt be able to keep out of it
  and my dish-water is getting cold lift
  the kettle for me joe

     the de-fickle-ty persisted mr goslin
  as he poured the water  is that all french-
  men will have to join the colors yes ma-
  dame even i one joseph guesclin what
  else

    she stared at one joseph guesclin be-
  hind the thick lenses of his glasses his eyes
  would have had a dull look except that
  habitually the pupils of them were merry
  and the very eyes of his soul but she
  looked now in vain for the dancing light
  of fun then her eyes snapped warningly
  with suspicion did the blessed creature
  expect her to throw herself in his arms and
  implore him not to march forth to war
  he would betray her would he into a dem-
  onstration of overpowering affection

    but mr goslin knew that sally fitz was
  not to be taken by close-formation tactics
  more subtle was his maneuvering

     when i shall be-be gone he hast-
  ened on his voice breaking the sheer real-

  ism of his fictional prophesying  would
  you sal-lee-please sal-lee-cover over
  the artichokes with straw in good time be-
  fore the first freeze i-i shall not be
  here and if-if you-

  he was almost overcome besides he
wished to note how she was taking it if
sally fitz consented to bother herself with
his beloved artichokes which she called
 those foreign thistles then indeed must
sally fitz consumingly adore him beyond
all the dreams of his yearning and sally
fitz betrayed outgeneraled cornered-
sally fitz would shortly receive that tem-
pestuous hug to which her loving heart was
entitled deny protest and scold as she
might also would he kiss her would that
crafty gaul

  instead - instead she said shed heard
near about a plenty of his wild talk and
she wanted to get to her churning

   churning zut desperately ex-
claimed mr goslin  and of what im-
port is churning when a brave man perishes
for a kiss but one sal-lee

  the case for sally fitz is now complete
every woman eight years married will agree
that provocation justified the dish-towel

   oh said mr goslin mopping his face
with one tanned forearm  oh you big
beautiful doll

  but she saw the wistful look behind the
thick glasses and she felt as she did when
she had too harshly scolded one of the chil-
dren in the motherly way of full-bosomed
mothers she hastened to humor him she
stopped to glance at the newspaper that
was troubling him exactly as she would
stop her work to examine the oldest boys
stumped toe

   therell be seventeen million of them
will there she said snatching at a line
haphazard  seventeen million men out to
kill each other it held her imagination
for a second  pshaw i reckon theres
enough of them grown up to have more
sense and about those artichokes joe
which arent even the jerusalem kind that
hogs  eat youll still be here to see to
them yourself seventeen million men less
one man will leave a plenty and i hear the
children down in the apple-tree theyll
stuff themselves till they tumble out


all-story weekly

    i go to sec said mr goslin listlessly
i am already too long away from the cu-
cumbers

  negro women and children were picking
the cucumbers and negro men were pack-
ing them into splint barrels with burlap
tops and the barrels were being hauled in
drays down to the steamboat-landing
j guesclin was not a trucker who sent
garden sass to town in a one-horse wagon
sometimes for a main crop he chartered
a baltimore or philadelphia schooner on
his way to the cucumbers he stopped at the
apple-tree to let the children slide down
him to the ground for a moment each
pair of dimpled arms clung about his neck
until he had done a grimace to make each
tot laugh and taken toll of a kiss

   papa go like a great big old grampus
chasin a mobobile

   so he stopped a little longer to make the
authentic noises of a grampus chasing an
automobile mr goslins vocal cords were
attuned to his blithe soul and in the cause
of mirth there was no sound he could not
mimic

   papa go like-

  but he fled from the charge of the light
brigade after all his business was truck-
ing before he had helped load one wagon
of cucumbers for him also serbia might
have been vaguely somewhere on the moon
he was a busy man

  none the less he was at the mail-box
ahead of the carrier next morning waiting
for his paper and there he stood reading
it reading every european despatch long
after the carrier had vanished on his way
overnight the head-lines had swollen heavy
and black the heaviest and blackest ran
across the top of the sheet it was the
flare for a news story that would still be a
world story a thousand years hence the
editor knew that no type was big enough
he could only use the biggest he had which
had last done service to herald a verdict
of murder in the first degree aptly he
could have used that same line for this
however he changed it to make it read

armies mobilize 

   returning to the house the frenchman
left the paper with sally fitz without a

word and went on out he was working
late potatoes that day running one of the
cultivators himself over a small item of
news he would have been all animation
she looked round from her dusting of the
piano-player and watched him go puzzled
by his far-away brooding silence she
would much rather have him up to one of
his ridiculous shindies then she saw the
black letters and she sat down and read
the paper through

  goodness she gasped incredulous
 theyre worse than mexicans

  which she wouldnt have minded but
it was making a difference in joe he was
no longer the everyday joe goslin hus-
band father and provider he was un-
familiarly joseph guesclin a frenchman
she knew he was thinking of france it
was a time when a frenchman would
something more than his family and home
his cozy prosperous happiness and to-mor-
rows sunshine something more than the
country that gave him these was laying a
claim on him

    as if he wasnt the identical same as
an american  she mused jealously  but

i	ought to have made him take out his
papers long ago

   she had tried but sally fitz wasnt so
vehemently a reconstructed american her-
self the daughter of old mcdowell who
had shot at yankee gunboats from that
very river bank wouldnt be still this
did not help her to see why a man wanted
to keep on being a frenchman just for
some washed-out sentiment of nativity it
was so much more understandable and
regular to be an american like his family
and neighbors sally fitz had felt herself
righteously provoked many times at his
love of his native land and now more than
ever

   joe she demanded when he came in
to dinner and she saw that he was still
thousands of miles away  joe youre not
studying about going

  he went on sousing his face and hands
under the spigot and she put a hand on
his shoulder and shook him a little  are
you joe

  he looked at her blinking the water-
drops off his lashes and something in his
prince potentate or potato



manner or the straining of his eyes for clear
vision smote her

   joe she chided softly

  his mouth twitched under the black mus-
tache and his whole trouble came with his
words  that i could go he said

   of all things she ejaculated

   i know he admitted

  whatever obstacles she had in mind he
was thinking of his eyes they had caused
his exemption from military service so that
while yet hardly more than a boy he had
been free to leave france and track down
opportunity across the ocean he groped
along the wall for the towel and she put
the end of into his hand

   that would be the way she declared
 without your glasses the barn out there
is only a blur of fog to you and as for
aiming a gun at a man once youd lost
or broken them-

   but i could not miss he assured her
whimsical in spite of his mood  there
will be so many millions of them-of the
prussians-to shoot at

  there was one sedative so sally fitz
turned to the open window and called in the
children

   yes dinner she told them  theres
brunswick stew and corn on the cob-

   o-oh went the children

   and artichokes said sally fitz craft-
ily whereupon mr goslin put his hands
on his knees and went  o-oh

  march all you kids ordered sally
leading with the soup-tureen

  that night however sally fitz did not
sleep so well herself the war about to be
mixed in her dreams with her fathers ac-
counts of the war that had been war was
a vivid thing to sally fitz her father de-
scribing an item of bloodshed could with-
out leaving his front porch point out the
actual rock or scarred tree or bend in the
river where it had happened lime-gray
bullets and round shot were turned up in
the furrow at every plowing

   joe she said at breakfast  i dreamed
that cossacks trampled down our melon-
patch the scalawags came clattering out
of the woods down by the creek and com-
mandeered all my young turkeys

   they could not be cossacks mr gos-

lin corrected her  the cossacks are our
allies

  mrs goslin sniffed it was apparent that
that she would not trust them with her
young turkeys

   we were expecting a hostile richmond
fleet down the river any minute to bombard
us she went on  and a north calina
battle-ship squadron was trying to get past
old point to meet them and we were dig-
ging trenches with the potato-digger and
surry county had sent us an ultimatum
about something and isle of wight
county-

   well what were the isle of blighters
doing prompted mr goslin

   i dont exactly remember laying
mines i reckon or maybe they were going
to be neutral seemed like somebody ought
to be neutral oh dear she sighed
 but im certainly glad were not
europe 

   it would be right discou-raging as-
sented mr goslin his eyes on the clock
his mind on the mail-carrier his whimsi-
calities were only mechanical and sally
gave it up

  he walked down the drive to the road
and waited for the carrier again perhaps
this mornings paper would say that every-
thing was being smoothed over anxiously
he hoped his heart ached at thought of
beautiful france attacked and he unable
to go in the strength of his youth they
had rejected him they wanted none of his
encumbering useless sacrifice now france
did not waste the blood of her sons that
way no he could not go that was his
sorrow his sorrow if he could go and did
go-but of that anguish he had not had oc-
casion to think since france did not waste
the blood of her sons

  a square envelope in the mail riveted
his attention before even the black head-
lines of the morning paper it was from
the french consulate in norfolk with
thoughts so massed and jammed that no
one thought wholly crossed the threshold
of his brain he tore open the envelope and
read the official sheet of paper it contained
from the bottom he turned to the begin-
ning and read again as if the thing were
a continuation of itself still no one


all-story weekly

thought wholly entered although there was
a hammering throb along every pulse

  leave all that was dearest to him in life

  the knowledge might clutch and gripe
his heart but no it was no ordered fact of
the brain yet

  he was reading the missive for the third
time when he stopped looked around him
dumbly and hastened back to the house
he entered by the front door mumbled
something in french to sally about an old
leather trunk being his affair and started
up the stairs but sally barred his way
with an arm on the newel she had been
watching for him although angrily fighting
down any such foolishness as a premonition

   i go to pack he explained vacantly
and again in french not in years had
sally heard french from his lips she did
not understand french

  joe youre puffing like youd been run-
ning now hand over that paper

  but instead of the newspaper he thrust
on her the communication from the con-
sulate

   wait joe you know i cant read this
gibberish its in french what-she
twisted his sleeve between her fingers to
hold him

  he blinked not realizing that words of
such import could be blank and meaning-
less to another twice he began to tell her
and began again because he was not using
english but at last she understood every
valid french citizen in the world between
the ages of twenty and forty-eight was
commanded to join the colors a french
liner was leaving baltimore the next day
and joseph guesclin was instructed to take
that ship after first reporting to the consul
in baltimore for his transportation

   i go now to pack said joseph
guesclin

   joe

  he turned sal-lee but the very
sob in his throat as he embraced her was
but the grief of a man still dreaming the
only fact to which he was awake was the
call to the colors

  she pushed him from her shaking him
in the robust indulgent way she had  is
the man daft she wanted to know
 listen to me joe goslin you dont have

to go who is there to make you and
whats more-whats everything-you have
no right to go

   i have yet to pack said joseph
guesclin going up the steps

  he took the north-bound that afternoon
lie broke down of course telling them
good-by at the station on his knees he
strained each little goslin-flesh of his flesh
poignantly dear-one after another in his
arms and again and all together and held
them while his heart burst and the train
was moving when he stumbled to his feet
yet once more he hugged sally and ran
groping for the rail of the last platform
but not until he swung on the step and
waved his hand and the little group back
there went in the blur of his own tears did
joe goslin wake up then all the way to
baltimore late in the night and aboard the
liner next day and at sea most of all joe
goslin kept on waking up

  after all it was mostly a definition of
patriotism that mr goslin got straightened
out not in words perhaps but certainly in
clarified mental vision he and the french
consul at norfolk knew each other french-
men were not so many around there but
that the prominent ones would know one
another mr goslin-no m guesclin-
always made himself acquainted with each
new consul and paid his respects it was a
sort of wistful renewal of allegiance to the
country of his birth however the call to
the colors reached his address not because
the consul happened to know him it would
have arrived in any event that is ever
since he had left france a boy and in all
his wanderings after opportunity a bureau
of the ministry of war back in paris knew
always where he was and at any time
whether he was tramping through the wheat
country of canada looking for work or
submerged among the work-hunters of chi-
cago or keeping track of material at a
mexican mining-camp a call to the colors
would have reached his address it made
a frenchman feel his importance this hav-
ing his countrys eye always on him so
that she could appeal to him in her need
but after a little wakeful absence of senti-
ment the thing began to deaden into an-
other phase something grisly uncanny
prince potentate or potato



that following eye ceased to be fond
benevolent nay it never had been it
followed him not to bestow but to take
nor was it any longer france that called
but a monster across the ocean a famishing
monster

  europe choked mr goslin shaking
his fist in the east  i say damn europe 
he did say it exactly so in plain english

  well and so the monster was ravenous
past decency at last gaul teuton and
slav wherever they were were summoned
back to give their blood zut call it la
mobilization generate if you like

  but it was when he peered over the stern
rail at the haze of receding shore-line that
mr goslin awoke fully and for keeps he
gazed with longing not knowing why the
longing grew to an ache and still he did
not know why this was apart from his
anguish at leaving his loved ones were
he a reservist in france he would be leav-
ing his loved ones just the same no an
affection never before suspected stole upon
him for that land whose fading coast was
marked by the haze but why strange
it had only been a foreign country to him
even to the last after more than half his
life that it had nourished him true he
had often felt a warmth of gratitude but
vaguely placed as in any benign ordering
of circumstances there he had found op-
portunity there the joy of hard work day
by day joy because of those he worked
for yes sal-lee and the little ones there
they were too mr goslin took off his
glasses and rubbed the end of his hand-
kerchief into a corner of each eye with
his glasses still in his hand he batted his
eyes blinking at the tumbling wraves and
the white-and-green jumble of the ships
wake and beyond his gaze became fixed
something was different the haze in the
west was like a hovering shroud of cannon-
smoke and the coast-line the coast of
america was gone involuntarily his arms
trembled from his side outstretching

  my country he spoke aloud before
he knew

  for a moment he was a bit nonplused
france lay the other way the way they
were going but his arms were held out to
the vanished shore then he knew

  nothing was clearer now to his logical
french head-nothing back there he had
left the things for which men fight-aban-
doned them and the country that gave
them he had no right to go sal-lee was
right about that and no more had he the
heart to go they were only faint tendrils
that bound him to his native land but the
tap-root of his life that was deep in the
new soil and to tear it out was to leave
bleeding the shreds of his being generous-
ly he grieved for beautiful france in her
peril and half his worldly goods he would
give and later did contrive to give but-
himself he had no right to give he owed
himself to the country that had given him
all and what she had given him it was his
duty to cherish and protect whether by toil
and loving watchfulness in the sunshine of
peace or with his life should a storm-
tossed night of war ever come

  mr goslin in his awakened state ruefully
shook his logical head

   at the least he meditated   have
my pat-ri-tism on straight alas but too
late-too late

  five days thereafter-days mind you-
mr goslin came on sally fitz moodily
feeding her young turkeys in the poultry-
yard he had left his trunk at the station
and his best clothes were gray with the
norfolk sand of the road no neighbor
happening to be at the station the homing
reservist had walked buoyantly walked
the soul of him aglow behind the thick-
glazed windows

  sally fitz turned at his step and the pan
of meal in the bend of her plump arm
clattered to the ground

   oh my goodness she gasped sobbed
laughed  whats the matter with the war
of the dead dutchman

  he put his foot in the pan and hugged
her

  after a while he was able to explain
the third day out they had received a
wireless of the declaration of war and or-
ders to race back out of the way of german
cruisers so the helm was shifted and
forced draft put on and lights put out at
night  and the ship entire said mr
goslin  canvased over like a packing-
house ham and all of us skippers inside


all-story weekly

where he added poetically  there had
been but one

  sally looked up quickly  oh joe you
are back really arent you

  he ignored the mocking tribute  ah
madatne i am back more than you sus-
pect he declared  first listen to the
officer of the french army who has charge
of us who says to me at the baltimore dock
as we step ashore  m guesclin says he
 we do not know now when we can send
reservists across the ocean- 

   good old ocean  murmured sally fitz
 precisely  but when we can he says
 we shall have room only for-for- oh he
was most desolated to have to say it so i
say it for him  for the most fit i say and
he nods his head he thinks i am all de-
jetion  ah monsieur he exclaims  you
are a brave man you respond you
would pay your debt to france and she
releases you the debt is paid monsieur
 next sal-lee listen to me  ah man
capitaine i say  i think so myself fur-
thermore captain i continue  in one-half
bffur if you meet me then or subsequently
please to pronounce my name goslin so
for i go now for my papers which will turn
me into a united states citizen 

   joe

   precisely madame you just hear me
say what i say

   and youre not going to get called to
any more old colors

   not unless they have the name old
glo-ree

  she sank her nose into his shoulder
 you are here you are here oh she
said  thank god for america

  he pressed his lips to the back of her
neck  because why sal-lee he ques-
tioned low in one ear -because i am
here

  she pushed herself away alluringly
flushed  go way from me man no
because i dont want cossacks and things
running off with my young turkeys

  it was not the wistful look that came
into his eyes he seized her deliberately
 you great big beautiful doll he said
 i am onto your curves- meditatively
he stroked her shoulder  of an arch-
duchess they are so

   thinking protested sally struggling
 thinking i got time to-

   oh but said mr goslin wickedly
 i cut across through the kitchen garden
and those artichokes-i happened to notice
that they have just been weeded most de-
votedly hand-weeded ah sal-lee it is no
use you are one crazy thing about me and
a few thousand kisses-joy of heaven here
come the children

  but after the children and the joy of the
first days as they passed and during the
days that came joe goslin american
mourned as joseph guesclin frenchman
but all america truly america was mourn-
ing as joseph guesclin frenchman there
was in it the same generous heart that
throbbed and ached and filled with anguish
with wrath too-a stifled and terrible
wrath things dear to america were being
assailed and it was no aspersion on his loy-
alty to america but truest symbol thereof
that joe goslin yearned ever more to be in
trenches in a foreign land fighting for
france vainly did joes sally seek to
rally him

   eh but yes - yes he would reply
heavily  i go now to the potatoes and
going as lowly as a potato he knew
himself

  but at last-at last for those things dear
to america america herself would fight

   the call sal-lee-its the call to the
colors cried joe in his hand was
clenched the newspaper the daily black
lettering across the page now the nations
heart-throb become articulate  the col-
ors sal-lee this time the ve-rit-able col-
ors-old glo-ree and joe went

  back to your potatoes sir sternly
spoke the army officer to whom he went
and there was that in his manner which
made joe feel as if he were deserting under
fire jumping junkers man cried the
officer  we want to win this war and its
potatoes that  do it

  for the moment joe goslin blinked
but then he understood involuntarily he
saluted

   i go now to the potatoes mon officier
he said and facing back to the trenches as
ordered as proud as prince or potentate
he knew himself

bj tfve editor

tfie riddle of greatness is still unsolved in spite of shakespeares contribution to
the controversy some are born great some achieve greatness and some have
greatness thrust upon them the poet tells us all of which describes a result
rather than a cause the dispute which wages about the dual factors of heredity and
environment remains where it was undoubtedly both a mans inheritance and his
environment each play an important part in the final result which we call character
anyhow the hero of the new six-part serial in the forthcoming number of this

eastward ho

by william macleod raine
author of one who was afraid the pirate of panama men in the raw etc

is a man whose greatness is at once so genuine and so admirable we have no hesitation
in saying clay lindsay will take rank among the most popular of all-stoky weekly
heroes who have appeared in our pages during the past year clay comes from
arizona without a rival in the daring game of breaking the broncos and estimating
human beings all his instincts are the healthy normal instincts of a man who has
lived under the open tent of the sky and with the ripple of a clean wind in his brain as
well as in his hair new yorkers thought him a rube and were ready to tolerate him
as a picturesque  extra  in the big metropolitan movie but from clarendon brom-
field rich clubman down to jerry durand ex-pugilist and present political gangster
all who measured wits or brawn with lindsay learned they were face to face with
greatness women good and bad felt the impact of his sterling goodness and one
woman- but here is your chance to get the story fresh from the authors pen with-
out the despoiling revelations of the editor dont overlook this bet if you like a
ripping good story with a western hero and a metropolitan wise en scene here is an
unusual combination with the finest elements of both types of story  eastward
ho opens in next weeks number

t  

despite rudyard kiplings famous assertion
that east and west will never meet till
judgment day every writer of western stories
from before the palmy days of o henry down to
the present has endeavored to bring about this
convulsion of nature and probably nine-tenths
of them have tried to make ends meet so to speak
in the forms of new york and western gunmen

  its a fruitful situation with all sorts of possi-
bilities will the  effete east  vindicate herself
in the guise of her champion or will wild and
woolly chivalry still reign supreme is there really a
fundamental difference between the hard-shooting
hard-swearing hard-living bad men of east and
west or are their differences merged as kipling
further said when both are strong men

each author has his own ideas on the subject
and the latest to tackle it is one whose stories met
with instant favor from the very first you shall
have his version of  the ballad of east and
west  complete next week in

trench phrase either learn how in the next
issue of this magazine

  you may never have camped on the sand-keys
of florida carried a pack through the forests of
the north paddled a canoe on a maine river or
watched a home-bound ship leave for home from
the beach of a south sea island perhaps your
life has been spent in some one city and your
experiences go no further than the every-day ex-
periences of the average man yet when you
read a story of a country in which you have never
been of people far different from your real-life
associates you will feel whether or not the writer
knows his people and the setting of his tale if
he doesnt-wo to the author the story is
spoiled for the reader in next weeks issue you
will find a novelette by an author who does know
his country one of the best tales of the southern
mountains that we have ever published-

the surrender of martha

by earl g curtis

author of  brothers to trouble  raffling rowdys
tools  sarah worths feud etc

  theres moonshine whisky in this story but it
isnt one of the usual run of moonshine stories
its a really gripping drama of the people of the
mountains by a man who knows them well a
well-told zestful tale that will keep you breath-
lessly interested from start to finish

  the coasts of bohemia are littered with the
debris of war from time immemorial men and
women who have chafed under the yoke of con-
vention have sought a wider freedom and a larger
license within her hospitable boundaries while
the sane and conservative citizen who looks
askance at the vagaries of art continues as he
always has to view bohemia with suspicion and
occasionally drop a bomb or two within her walls
both are extremists and therefore seldom right
charles belmont davis in his story  bohemia
good-by is a special pleader for neither side
but he lets us see how even success respectability
and comfort must sometimes turn with regret to
the former haunts of bohemia to recapture an
experience the memory of which lingers like the
poignant regret of a day that is done preston
turned and then- but why betray the authors
secret you will find it all beautifully told in
next weeks magazine

  in next weeks issue you will find one of
the most beautifully written stories that has ap-
peared in any magazine for a long time- the
silent pool by george gilbert but do not
get the idea that it is all writing and no story
the tale that mr gilbert has to tell is worthy of

his way of telling it the scene is laid in india
the characters are natives of that land of romantic
mystery the action moves with something of the
tragic certainty that made kiplings indian tales
the talk of the reading world this gilbert story
is something that no lover of the best in short
fiction can afford to miss reading

  have you ever noticed how free from suspicion
and rash judgment unconsciously good people
are and how quick to rush to moral conclusions
are the people w ho make a profession of goodness
or want to devote their lives to the moral uplift
of their neighbors nothing can down the people
who get a moral satisfaction out of their own
conscious rectitude except a rude awakening
gilbert riddell in  a liberal education
instances the case of a woman who had drawn her
conclusions and was planning her frontal attack
for the reformation of two friends when- but
we cannot risk taking the edge off of your ap-
preciation of this clever characterization by be-
traying the writers secret read this story in
next weeks magazine and you will be more ready
to give the other fellow and his girl the benefit
of the doubt

  next week you will find another corking animal
story by harold de polo this time the four-
footed hero is a wolf caught when a cub by a
brutal man and broken to pull a sled like a dog
then came the call of the wilderness and then-
but you must read this great story yourself its
title is  bad boileau and beaut and its
very well worth reading

      real appreciation

to the editor

  have been reading and thoroughly enjoying the
all-story weekly for a year or two and look
forward with pleasurable anticipation to receive
every number

  a conversation between chief justice of the
united states supreme court melville c fuller
and his associate ludge lamar is related in
which the chief justice declared that he found re-
laxation from his judicial work in reading ten-
cent novels to which ludge lamar answered that
he enjoyed the five-cent stories better because
there was more action in them

  the readers of the  ali-story weekly can
find a variety of good fiction to suit not only the
taste of the lover of action but that of the most
fastidious reader of the best literature

  furthermore there is not a story which is not
clean and fit to be read by the youngest member
of a family

  the love stories are not filled with the vague
half-baked sex dreams and problems of the idle
rich but they present the fine heart-throbs of
dean vigorous healthy men and women boys
and girls of every clime ard country
heart to heart talks



  the world is its field-one week we are in the
dreamy oriental far east the next in the breezy
dashing fighting west again adventuring in the
caribbean and as during the past few weeks
dwelling among the ancient greeks in fact the
all-story weekly furnishes good reading for
the boy or girl the clergyman the business man
the ordinary man or woman who desires to pass
a pleasant hour the college professor the busy
lawyer the profound philosopher and the hard-
working judge can find some story to appeal to his
tastes or furnish him with that relaxation all
workers mental or physical require

clavering the incredible the
best of all

to the editor-

  may i add a word of appreciation for the
all-story weekly along with your other read-
ers though not a subscriber i have been a
constant reader of the magazine since back in the
cavalier days the best story to me then was
 clavering the incredible and i have not yet
found one that surpasses it

  with such writers as zane grey c b stilson
robert simpson max brand harold titus jack-
son gregory johnston mcculley hulbert foot-
ner and j b hendryx it is easy to see how the
all-story weekly is among the best-thanks to
the editor i see many requests for sequels to
 the untamed  and  the texan if there
are sequels let us hope they are good ones for
those are two stories that can easily be spoiled
by a sequel and do not change the character of
whistling dan if he is brought back for twould
be better to leave him alone  the grouch  and
 broadway bab  were different from the usual
run of the stories they give us a change with
their humor give us more of them

   the border legion  was another good story
but like clavering the incredible i see no ex-
cuse for a man standing up before a gang of
murderers and being shot to pieces to protect a
woman who does not even appreciate the act to
say nothing of the man such men are scarce
women also

  i am glad to see that peter gross is with us
again he is one of my favorite characters i
also like semi-dual and what has become of that
man creive stella m durings story  tempta-
tion of carlton earle keeps one always inter-
ested and lacks those tiresome long descriptions
pardon the long letter but accept my best wishes
for the ali-story weekly

tember  iqto issue

little heart-beats

  may i express my sincere admiration of your
splendid magazine most all of the stories are
fine but i particularly enjoy the  different 
kind ive noticed some knocking the palosian
srtories calling them impossible  do not con-
sider them so for i know that one can travel in
the  astral for i have done it many times my-
self are we going to have more semi-dual
stories i wish it were possible to find out what
became of larry and lakla

mrs s m healy

  missoula montana

  as i have never seen a letter from this part of
the state in the heart to heart talks will write
you as i read the all-story weekly i am
not a subscriber i get the book from the news-
stand and just think it is fine i like all of the
stories of course there are some i like better
than others we must have a sequel to  the
conquest of the moon pool it was just fine
and also the untamed tell max brand to
hurry and bring us a sequel as kate is unhappy
without dan as ever a reader

mrs lucy j stowe

  thorndale texas

  i just want to write and tell you how much i
appreciate your magazine the all-story
weekly the  different  stories are the best
and  the conquest of the moon pool  is the
finest piece of fiction yet written my favorite
authors are a merritt e r burroughs and
max brand please mr editor can you tell me
if there is going to be a sequel to  the conquest
of the moon pool i dont like people who
knock our stories and especially  different 
ones cant you wake burroughs up to write us
a story soon and a merritt i see that every
one is pulling for max brand and i am pulling
too for that matter wishing your magazine

reason our druggist failed to receive his stock for

what it intensive train-

ii-	in has qualified

has done men like you for

the positions they wanted - given
them steady employment-made them

sought after by employers-multiplied their
earning power - made them leaders in their
chosen lines for thousands it has changed
the drudgery of getting by into the joy of
getting on do you realize that the same
intensive training can do the same for you

why if doing things better
k	 than the other fellow-

does i thinking and acting for
yourself-having a grip on your task
-the expert touch - the trick of

knowing how-that is why you succeed
after intensive training that is what it does
for you training clears away the cobwebs
throws the spotlight on the things you dont
know about your work and makes you the
master of any emergency

dont fool yourself

 every day you put off training you have to pay the price of not knowing how the amount you
 earn represents what you know-what you can do the problem of how to increase your earn-
 ing power is simple-just train dont be fooled into
 thinking that luck or pull will make you a winner

 the man without training just scrambles through life
 -never a money-maker-never sure of his job-never
 holding a responsible position its the trained man who
 gets all the favors-the best jobs and the big pay as long as you
 refuse to train you must pass up opportunities and make way for
 the man who does face the facts and then let the american
 school help you into a better position-the one you want-as it
 has helped its thousands of students get into the game dont

 into the hotel lobby walked a beautiful woman
 and a distinguished man little indeed did the
 gay and gallant crowd know that around these
 heads there flew stories of terror-of murder-and
 treason that on their entrance half a dozen detec-
 tives sprang up from different parts of the place

 because of them the lights of the war depart-
 ment in washington blazed far into the night with
 their fate was wound the tragedy of a broken
 marriage of a fortune lost of a nation betrayed

                     it is a wonderful story with the kind of
      rrfi	 mystery that you will sit up nights trying

 tbit	to fathom it is just one of the stories
