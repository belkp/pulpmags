bravest of the brave

 a story of the mexican war

 by harry lakeland

chapter i

a cam to arms

  the flower and chivalry of ixjuisiana had gathered and
bright lights shone over fair women and brave men

  it was the tb of march

in one of the most beautiful halls in new orleans there
was assembled the very- cream of her aristocratic society

  no more beautiful women ever smiled and no braver
men ever breathed than were there drawn together to
weave up mazes of giddy dance and chase the glowing
hours with flying feet

  while this revelry was at its height there came news of
trouble on the mexican border the march of general tay-
lor upon the skirts of the enemy and the call for volun-
teers

  a messenger from the governor came hastily into the
ball-room he was in search of one of his excellencyrs
aides who was taking part in the festivities

  expectation had lteen on tip-toe for several days and
when he appeared he was quickly surrounded by a dozen
brave fellows who eagerly asked for the news

  samuel walker a west point graduate was among the
number lie was known to bo a brave gallant young fel-
low but being poor and not belonging strictly to the new
orleans aristocracy he was not what might have been
called a pampered son of society

  lie had only been back from west point about two
months and as yet had not been assigned to any regiment
although he left the military school with the rank of lieu-
tenant

  there were several other graduates from west point
there some of them with assignments and some without
they knew when the governors messenger appeared on the
floor of the ball-room that something unusual had hap-
pened and so did nearly every one present for hardly had
he taken a dozen steps towards the spot where captain
davis afterward the president of the southern confed-
eracy stood than they forsook the dance and crowded
anxiously around him

  what is it tom asked one of them

  we have lively news from the rio del norte said the
messenger

  what asked a dozen voices

  general tayler with his little army has moved upon
disputed soil and is even now threatened by the whole
greaser army

  a thrill almest like a convulsion swept the listening
throng

  the general has sent to several states for olunteers
i louisiana among the rest and you ofticers and west point-
ers are requested to report to him at once

  a wild cheer rang through the hall and the dancing fes-
tivities were at an end a quick rush was made for the
cloak-room by the west pointers while those interested iu
the quarrel between the united states and mexico followed
and made arrangements for sudden departure

  ladies clung to their partners and the floor manager en-
deavored to restore order the band that had ceased play-
ing when the messenger first appeared in the hall now
struck up a favorite waltz in the hope of quieting the ex-
citement

  a few caught their partners and whirled away but the

  but when hank told them that he would become their
captain if they wished it they cheered with all their might
and showed quite as much delight as he had said they
would they grasped him warmly by the hand and nearly
tore him to pieces in their ecstasy

  dalton was right the rangers had made up their mrnds
to offer themselves to general taylor in the capacity of
scouts which he so much needed but as they talked it
over among themselves they concluded that they should
make a poor show beside the richly caparisoned cavalry
troops and on that account they had sent hank dalton
to new orleans to buy them things they needed most to im-
prove their appearance

  but his returning with a real live west pointer who
would become their captain was more than they had ever
dared to expect and so their enthusiasm knew no bounds
a formal meeting was at once held a company book
opened every mans name written in it to the extent of
seventy-five after which walker was formally elected cap-
tain adu hank dalton lieutenant

  by the time all this was done the boxes arrived contain-
ing the additions to their uniforms and the whole evening
was spent in adjusting them and fixing the trappings for
their horses in this business captain walker showed his
taste and education and when they turned out in the
morning it would have been hard to have found a finer
looking squadron

  by nine oclock they were ready to march for point isa-
bel to offer themselves to general taylor and although
they did not ride like trained cavalrymen yet each was
mounted on a superb horse and could ride through and
over almost anything in the world all they wanted was
the polish which walker could give them to become the
first body of cavalry in the country

chapter rn

oettinp quickly dows to business

  it was about noon when captain walker led his men up
before the headquarters and reported himself to general
taylor who gave him a warm greeting as he was anxious
to have all the recent graduates from west point with
him

  but i have not come alone general aid he

  so much the better lieutenant but you surely have not
raised a company so soon

  come to the door and see for yourself general

  with anxious curiosity depicted in his furrowed face
the brave old hero did as desired and there saw one of the
finest companies of monnted riflemen he had ever be-
held

  glorious but these arc texas rangers-how came you
in command of them 

  walker related the circumstances to the general who
listened with much interest to it

  bravo lieutenant this is indeed a romance of war i
congratulate you and hereafter shall address you as cap-
tain walker

  thanks general

  your men are the very ones i want above all others and
you may hold yourself in readiness for employment at any
moment	

  the quicker sir the better they are brave fellows
and will shrink at no danger i am sure and i being so
much younger with my shoulder-straps still fresh from
school am anxious to show them that i am worthy to cap-
tain them

  a noble soldierly ambition my boy and i feel certain
that you will do it your record at west point is the very
best and i have faith in you

  thanks general and i shall try to verify it

  you will adjutant bliss will assign you to ground
good-day captain and exchanging salutes the oldest and
youngest officers separated

  the next few days were given over to training and per-
fecting the company in cavalry evolutions but being apt
scholars and perfect riders it did not take long to get them
in good form

  at the end of the third day after their arrival and ire-
fore any of the volunteers had arrived to succor general
taylor he sent for captain walker who at once reported
captain you want dangerous work

  i do general

   very well i have some for you i need not tell you
that my little army is split in two and that we have to do
some hard fighting in order to maintain our position i
am afraid that the garpson opposite matamoras under
major brown will be attacked and captured thus making
my position much worse than it is the country between
point isabel and there swarms with mexicans i cannot
leave my position here for a general movement of my
whole force would bring twenty men to my one down upon
us a small body would not awaken more than a propor-
tionate number of the enemy i wish you to take three
wagon loads of ammunition under your escort and convey
them to major brown together with these dispatches

  i will do it general

  they are all ready march at once

  walker saluted and returned to his company of rangers
before whose quarters stood the three ammunition wagons
all ready to proceed on the dangerous journey

  work my men said he as they met him with much
anxiety to know what the general wanted

  a shout followed the announcement

  i will not insult you by asking if there is any one of
you who will not take a desperate chance against the enemy
with great odds against us for i think i know you but
we have got to escort those ammunition wagons to major
brown opposite matamoras with the country swarming
with the enemy

  good we are ready was the cry

  then to horse

  in five minutes they were mounted nearly every man
of the company had ridden over the ground and had often
met the greasers in fights consequently neither maps nor
guides were required

  a hearty cheer greeted them as they rode from the camp
captain walker and his lieutenant taking the lead while
the wagons moved between two squadrons of the rangers
bravest of the brave



  precisely as they expected the mexicans seemed to lie
aware of their movement as soon as they had got outside
of the american lines although they evidently looked upon
it as simply a scouting expedition and not a determined
attempt to reinforce and replenish an almost exhausted
fort

  for the previous few days a fierce bombardment had
been going on between the batteries before matamoras and
the fortress on the other side of the river the one they were
destined for but the ammunition being nearly exhausted
they were only replying at long intervals although the
houses in matamoras had nearly all been torn to pieces by
the shot-and shell which they had thrown into the town

  believing that it was only a scouting party the mexican
commander set canales a renowned robber who had joined
the army for the sake of plunder to watch it he having
about two hundred of the worst rough riders and cut-
throats to be found in mexico

  this fierce brave undoubtedly possessed some military
talent although he was a robber by nature and profession
and no stranger to many of the texifns who had met him
in rough fights several times

  he soon learned the strength of walkers band and
laughing at their presumption pretended to retreat before
them for the purpose of drawing them into some treacher-
ous place from whence they could not escape and where he
could turn upon and annihilate them at his leisure

   it was not a pleasant prospect for the little band of brave
hearts but they were not deecived in the least regarding
his intentions

  i know what his game is said lieutenant hank dal-
ton after they had followed canales for three or four
miles about two miles this side of the fort there is a
ravine wide an deep we had a brush with a lot of
greasers thar during the texas fight agin em an its a bad
place a good wide road leads inter the place but onlv a
narrow path leads out at the far end if he coaxes us in
thar were gone thats sure

  but he wont get us in there lieutenant said walker
whose keen eye was taking in everything there must be
a road to the right or left of this one and even if it is not
so good we shall take it

  right captain thar is a road this side tve been over
it heaps of times

  all right let him think we are following him into this
trap i think  know how to fix him give me as good a
description as you can of the locality

  as they rode along he explained the ravine and every-
thing about it having sent a few horsemen ahead as if to
press the mexicans

  while they were even speaking they saw the foremost
horseman of the enemy disappear down the road leading
to the trap

  the noise of the caniftmading at matamoras seemed to
shake the earth they were marching on

  quick charge them to the entrance and then rejoin
on said he to dalton and away he flew with about thirty
of the rangers

  now then go for the fort for all your horses are
worth said he addressing the drivers of the wagons at
the same time pointing out the road to take

  the horses were put upon a gallop and turning to the
right took another road which led directly to the fort al-
though like all roads in that part of the country it was a
very bad one

  by the time they got past the curve which led down into
the ravine the detachment returned having driven the rear
portion of canales squadron into it with some confusion

  sergeant bolton return wtih twenty-five men and make
a demonstration tlrnt will keep them there avoid an en-
counter as long as possible for those wagons must reach the
forts at all hazards ride and wheeling the company
proceeded to obey orders

  lieutenant dalton ride with twenty men and occupy
that nai-row path leading from the ravine on the other
side bold it and we have them caught in their own
trap

  with a wild cheer he stasted away at the same time say-
ing to one of his friends who rode beside him

  didnt i tell yer he war a little cuss

  seeing these orders obeyed captain walker put spurs to
his horse and rode to overtake the wagoners the fort was
already in sight but it was not replying to the tremendous
shower of shot and shell and was evidently out of ammuni-
tion

  this nerved walker to do his utmost and hastily dis-
patching one of his men to each of the detachments with
orders to have them hold the enemy in the ravine as long
as possible and then to ride at full speed for the fort he
rode forward at full speed

  canales was completely trapped bolton held the en-
trance to the ravine and lieutenant dalton the exit the
mexican brigand was not long in finding out the mistake he
had made and sent his men off in different directions
where there were exits known to them and by so doing he
hoped to gain the rear of the texans

  but before this could be accomplished the ammunition
wagons had reached the exhausted fort and the rangers
turned and followed it leaving the discomfited mexican
growling and cursing his luck

  never was succor welcomed with wilder applause never
were heroes of bloodless victory more highly honored than
were these brave rangers and their skilful captain by the
forlorn command at fort brown

  with a wild hurralr from the soldiers the gunners
again sprang to their guns and reopened fire upon the mex-
icans on the opposite shore this evidently astonished
them very much for they had for a long time been aware of
the scarcity of powder in the entrenchment and had
treated the whole thing as a gala day affair with only a
question of time as to when the garrison would surren-
der

 

chapter iv

lotting iip the dogs of wak

  captain walker stood on the parapet of fort brown
and watched the effect of the shots from the guns and oc-
casionally suggesting a change in the aim of some of them


bravest of the brave

 the rangers were calmly grooming their horses and
 getting ready for the next move whatever it might be the
 very earth was shaking with the fierce cannonade which
 could not last much longer on the part of the americans
 as their supply of ammunition was again growing short

 presently there came a boom of cannon from the direc-
 tion of point isabel

 this indicated a move on the part of general taylor
 he listened with agitated heart

 by the aid of his glass he could see the mexican troops
 marching in that direction and the gaily caparisoned lan-
 cers spurring their fierce horses toward the scene of the
 conflict

 saddle up he shouted

 instantly his brave command sprang to obey the order
 but still in wonder regarding what the movement meant

 again the thunder of artillery shook the earth in the
 distance and away to the north arose a cloud of sulphurous
 smoke

 hank dalton heard it and mounted the wall by the side
 of his youthful companion

 what is it cap he iisked

 i think taylor lias either attacked the enemy at pain
 alto or they have attacked him at all events there is an
 engagement going on said walker

 thats so us true as grass

 and we must have a hand in it

 you bet

 are the men readv to ride

 all ready

 then let us go for we may be of service to the general
 in a moment of need

 as they were about to leap down into the fort a ten-
 inch shell whistled over their heads and fell close to a
 gun by the side of which stood captain flood the com-
 mander of the fort succeeding major brown it exploded
 ns it struck and the gallant soldier fell in his tracks

 captain walker and dalton sprang to his side and with
 tender hands bore him to a grassy mound once and only
 once he opened his eyes

 dont let them have the fort boys said he faintly and
 then all was over

 no they shall never have a foot of american soil-
 never replied walker and every man in the garrison
 clenched his fists in deep resolve

 the next in command at once assumed it and the bom-
 bardment went feebly on

 to saddle shouted walker

 the two men stood with one foot in the stirrup and the
 command was hardly issued before each one was astride of
 his powerful steed

 the men all heard the distant cannonade and felt that
 something bloody was transpiring even the horses felt it
 and with dilated nostrils and heads oreet they drew fever-
 ish breath and pawed the earth savagely with their impa-
 tient feet

 walker mounted his own horse and rode to the head of
 the column

 soldiers our comrades are having hot work we must
 assist them forward

 a wild cheer rang out from the men and even the

 stricken garrison shouted as the rangers rode from the
  gateway out upon the open plain

   lomler and louder grew the noise of distant battle and
 nearer too it seemed to come

   the mexicans at matamoras became so much interested
 in the struggle which they knew was going on and which
 they also could plainly hear that they ceased their fire
 upon the devoted fort and mounting their works they bent
 forward with their hands lo their ears to catch every wave
 of sound which came from the battle-field  or they cheered
 loudly so confident were they that the little army of ameri-
 cans were being cut to pieces and destroyed

   walker put spurs to his horse and dashed off toward the
 battle-field followed by his sturdy men each with a lions
 heart and each eager for the fray

   general canales who had been waiting for walker and
 his men to return now rode to the scene of conflict but as
 luck would have it only half a mile in advance of the
 texan rangers

   from an unhorsed ranchero they learned who it was
 and then with redoubled speed they continued on after
 him

   by this time the roar of the battle had increased and the
 wind was wafting vast clouds of smoke away to the left

   canales never would have expected or looked for an en-
 emy in his rear at that time but crazy for a fight that
 would wipe out the worse than defeat that he lmd suffered
 at the hands of walker he led his savage hordes headlong
 towards the fight

   and indeed he was needed there if ever for general
 taylor had driven arista quite a distance and just then
 lie was checked and a few more men or one impetuous
 charge would hurl destruction upon him and his brave lit-
 tle army

   canales was the man for the emergency and quickly
 setting his squadrons he led them forward with fierce
 yells

   tt was a terrible yet beautiful sight to see these gaudily
 trapped horsemen plunging onward with their murderous
 lances poised and their streamers fluttering in the sul-
 phurous air

   but walker and his men were close upon him and even
 before he could strike a blow they fired a deadly volley
 from their rifles and then dashed in with their revolvers
 emptying a saddle at even- fire

   consternation seized canales and his men and while the
 confusion was at its height the bold rangers drew their
 cutlasses and completed the work they had so nobly begun

   cuptain walkers horse had been killed but with sword
 in hand he was seeking the thickest of the fight two of
 his rangers rode to his rescue but they were shot down just
 as canales and one of his fierce rancheroes galloped down
 upon him

   hastily mounting one of the horses and snatching the
 word of the fallen ranger in his left hand he spurred and
 received the charge of the fiery canales and his man
 catching the sword of the one upon his own and the lance
 of the other upon that of bis wounded companion

   dualling lance and sword aside he escaped and wheeling
 quickly in his saddle he fired a shot from one of the pistols
bravest of the brave



 that he found in the holster and the ranchero fell head-
 ling from his plunging horse

   ten thousand curses upon that boy he has escaped me
again cried canales wheeling his horse to engage him
once more

   but by this time his horsemen were completely routed
for the quick eye of general taylor had detected the turn
in the tide of battle and hastily dispatching captain may
to the assistance of walker and his heroic rangers the
attack front and rear was too much and a wild panic seized
aristas army

   almost instantly there followed one of the wildest and
most horrible scenes ever witnessed on the battle-field all
discipline was lost and officers and men infantry and artil-
lery cavalry and all became crowded together each strug-
gling for a chance to escape the dead and wounded were
trampled under foot and to add to the general terror the
long dry grass of the prairie caught fire and quickly en-
veloped living dead and wounded in a wraith of flame

   hundreds were killed in this stampede and fire and in
less than fifteen minutes the haughty aristas army with
which he had marched out to gobble up the despised
north americans was in full retreat and the iirst battle of
the mexican war falo alto was won

chapter v

the battlk of res ac a k ia palma 

   as soon as the battle was over general taylor sent for
captain walker

   all torn and begrimed with smoke and smooch of the
battle he presented himself at the headquarters tent and
reported he was at once shown in to the commanding
general who arose and cordially extended his hand

   captain walker i have to thank you for taking it upou
yourself to help me win this victory without orders said
he

   and t thank you general for giving me a chance you
sent me to relieve the fort commanded by major brown i
succeeded in doing so and will make out my report to-
night then i was not under orders but a soldiers duty
is in such a case to go to the assistance of his general and
comrades i did so said walker modestly

   and you did it nobly i told you that you would make
your mark and you have done it

   if so i am content the fort opposite matamoras still
flies the american flag but general major brown has
fallen

   major brown killed

   yes general he fell just before  left

   theres a brave soul gone said taylor sadly

   he died where a soldier should always die at his post
of duty

  i could have spared many men better than major
brown but return to your quarters make out your re-
port and give it to me in the morning early tor we shall
probably have another brush with the enemy before we
cross the rio grande thank the texan rangers for me
and good-night

   good-night general said walker saluting and going
from his presence

   during the night which settled so mercifully down upon
the tired soldiers all was calm and peaceful and had it not
been for the groans of the wounded as they suffered under
the knife of the surgeon the mournful tramp of burial
parties as they did the last sad offices for their fallen com-
rades one would scarcely have believed that the terrible
besom of war had swept over the scene

   the smoke of battle and of burning grass had been swept
away by the evening breeze and the full moon rose proudly
up from her throne in the cast and bathed the world in a
sheen of silvery light beaming benignly on both friend and
foe

  general arista sent a detachment of wagons about mid-
night to gather up his dead the wounded of his army had
by this time received attention at the hands of our sur-
geons and until long past the hour when a tired general
should have sought his couch general taylor was going
around among his brave wounded fellows praising them
for their gallantry and consoling them in their misfortune

   but when he had finished his charitable rounds and re-
tired to his tent the whole camp was asleep and all was
silent save the measured tread of the guards who ever and
anon answered back the outposts alls well

   early the next morning the officers were astir for tay-
lor had summoned them to a council ofwar captain
walker was there with the others having with him his com-
pleted report which he had prepared before going to rest
the night before

  the scouts reported the position of the enemy and it
was decided to move forward without delay in the hope
of engaging him before he had completed his reorganization
and recovered from yesterdays defeat breakfast was at
once prepared and everything got in readiness for a march

   but there was nothing forced about it for even- soldier
seemed delighted at the prospect of again engaging the
enemy and finishing the flogging they had begun the day
before

   breakfast over and rations packed in knapsacks the line
of battle was formed and at once moved forward toward
resaea dc la palma where in the distance even now could
be seen the vanguard of the mexicans hastening toward the
chaparral

  on approaching the chaparral general taylor became
convinced that the enemy occupied it in force and another
battle seemed inevitable and to prepare for it the troops
were halted near a convenient watering place where they
were allowed a season of repose

   i would like a volunteer for a piece of extra hazardous
scouting said general taylor in the hearing of a com-
pany of volunteers

   gineril im yer puddin an milk said a long lank
yankee springing up and saluting him

   the general looked at him a moment in surprise for he
was the last person in the world whom he would have ex-
pected to respond to such a call

  whats your name my man he asked at length

  klain w baxter company a first mississippi volun-
teers a lorn yankee right from varmount happened to
be in jackson when the sogers were goin joined right in


bravest of the brave

with um gineral an here i am right smart i thank yer
replied the volunteer

  well you give a pretty straight account of yourself
replied taylor laughing

  give us a chance gineral and ill give an account of
myself you bet replied the volunteer

  have you ever seen any service before now

  dam it gineral ive seen eenemost everything this
side of kickin the bucket

  but the service i wish just now will subject you to
great danger and requires- good judgment

  try me gineral an if i go scewways shoot me for a
darn fool 

  all right i will trv you come to my tent said the
general riding away to a little tent that had been pitched
for him pending the coming battle

  gineral ill du my eternal best said he

  thats all i can ask go at once you see that range
of hills and the opening between them

  yes

   i suspect the enemy is strong there find out all about
it

  ill du it gineral and away he started armed only
with a pair of pistols and a short sword

  meanwhile captain walker captain mccall captain
c f smith and a parly of rangers were ordered to advance
and reconnoiter the enemys position on the left near the
field of resaca do la palma and after skirmishing they
found him in force

  the position chosen in the enemy for the second days
battle was a most admirable one for defensive warfare
by rights it should be called a ravine instead of a field
it was about two hundred feet wide and from four to six
feet deep being crossed at right angles by a road leading
to matamoras the ridges on each side wore covered with
dense rows of chaparral utterly impenetrable to horse and
defying every weapon save the bayonet

  on the return of baxter he reported that he had suc-
ceeded in creeping up near enough to look through the
intervening chaparral and found that the enemy lay in
double rows both in the ravine and in the thicket nearest
to the american lines and that another line of them ex-
tended through the chaparral on the opposite bank

  three powerful batteries were placed so as to completely
sweep the road their fires at the same time crossing each
other

  taylor thanked his successful spy and sent him back to
his regiment which was by this time getting ready to take
its place in the line of battle and he was received by a
rousing cheer by both his own company and the whole regi-
ment

  the battle ground presented a marked contrast to palo
alto where the fighting was in an open field and through
such a pttffi defended by six thousand men must taylors
little army of less than two thousand men force its way if
it succeeded in reaching matamoras

  rut the doughty old hero had as much confidence in his
men as they had in him and never for a moment did of-
ficer or soldier hesitate on the contrary they seemed
restive and eager for the fray

  after the american army had partaken of a hearty din-

ner and all had become rested and refreshed captains
mccall and smith were ordered to advance and bring on
the action which from the first seemed destined to be one
of artillery

  it cannot he said that the discipline of taylors army
was any better than that of aristas if indeed it was so
good but at length superior bravery and dash on our side
prevailed and gradually foot by foot the mexicans were
driven with the bayonet through the chaparral and forced
to take refuge in a more distant and secure position

  cheer upon cheer were given by the americans engaged
and re-echoed by their restless comrades who had not yet
been ordered into the fight especially was the cavalry and
the texas rangers anxious to take part in the battle but as
yet no opportunity had offered itself

  and yet the strife did not cease with the retreat of the
mexican infantry the batteries in the ravine still poured
into the heart of the american infantry storms of iron
hail mowing the brave fellows down by scores while on the
very verge of victory

  the eagle eye of general taylor saw that the fate of the
day hung upon these guns and he hastily ordered captain
may of the regular cavalry and captain walker of the
texan rangers to report to him two braver or more
dashing young officers never spurred their horses to the
trumpets call

  captains charge those batteries said he pointing to
the mexican stronghold

  they both saluted and turned their horses to ride away

  and lake them  he added with big emphasis

  captain may and his men took the lead closely followed
by the rangers and the whole command swept down the
road towards the ravine

  i he mexicans were scattered and the guns were ours
rut they were not disposed to submit to such a fate and in
a few moments they rallied with several companies of in-
fantry who had hurried to their rescue and with fixed
bayonets returned to the shock throwing themselves stub-
bornly between their guns they wielded their swords hand
to hand with the cavalry

  but how long could they stand before the rifles and pis-
tols of the rangers and the fierce onslaught of the brave
dragoons of captain may one by one they sank and the
battery with its flag was securely ours general la vega
was among the captured he was struck at by may iu the
first charge hut parrying the blow he called his troops
around him and was on the point of discharging a cannon
when captain walker charged upon it with his rangers
and ordered him to surrender

  what to a boy he exclaimed gazing at walker

  lo captain walker if you please replied the bold
young officer proudly and la vega at once handed him
ins sword and was afterwards conducted to general tav-
lor

  i liree separate and fierce charges were made by the mex-
icans to regain the battery hut walker and maywith their
own hands assisted by the dragoons turned the guns upon
them with such terrible effect that the attempt was aban-
doned	r

  in the meantime a fearful struggle was going on in other
portions of the field infantry artillery and cavalry being
bravest of the brave



engaged a party under lieutenant woods actually forced
their way into general aristas camp and captured it after
a bloody hand to hand fight

  a large body of lancers was sent to retake it and they
succeeded in doing so and in killing lieutenant cochrane
and about twenty men although the americans soon ral-
lied and drove them out most effectually

  three cheers for hail colnmbit yankee doodle tjncle
sam star spangled banner and general zack taylor
yelled elam baxter leaping upon a cannon he had helped
to capture and swinging his hat

  cheer upon cheer was given and taken up by the soldiers
in other portions of the field the buttle was practically
won now and general taylor was busily engaged putting
the finishing touches to it although there was bloody work
to do yet

  captain walker was ordered to charge a column of lan-
cers which had stolen around to the americans right and
was now coming down like a whirlwind all unheeding the
shower of grape that was carrying destruction into their
ranks

  the charge was one of the neatest and fiercest of the
battle the rangers rode out to meet them and although
the mexicans were three to one the rifles of his men made
the difference not quite so grent before the two bodies met
in the shock of battle and then superior skill and bravery
soon bore its fruit and the lancers who still occupied
saddles turned and fled towards matamoras and the battle
of resaca de la palma was won

chapter vt

advrnttoe after the battik

  the haughty arista was a second time flying with his
well-nppointed army before a mere handfnl of men whom
he had affected to despise and for whose crushing and utter
wiping out he had left matamoras and crossed the rio
grande with his troops bedecked in holiday attire

  general arista bad reported the baffle of palo alto a
victory and great was the rejoicing at matamoras in honor
thereof and the people had all assembled when the battle
of resaca de la palma commenced to see the victorious
braggart return with what should be left of the vanquished
american army

  but the first arrival of fugitives the opening of fire
again from the garrison the roar of cannon in the rear
of their countrymen swelling louder fiercer and nearer all
the while seemed to be but poor harbingers of victory

  anxiety deepened into racking intensity and pale ter-
ror-stricken faces gazed silently towards the east in a
few moments their routed army came dashing through the
bushes which lined the opposite shore treading down and
riding over each other as they hurried wildly on to gain
the river bank terror and eager haste were depicted in
the countenances of the fugitives as they rushed onward to
the waters edge where they imagined there was safety

  all distinction of rank was lost in the common sense of
extreme danger

  the terrible americans of the north were in their rear
the city of refuge on the opposite shore

  then a knowledge of disaster flashed upon those waiting
anxious ones then arose a wail and matamoras rang with
a cry such as she had never heard before-one of misery
and despair

  all discipline and order was at an end although the guns
from the fort and the army had ceased their death-dealing
horses and innles riderless wounded themselves or bearing
wounded soldiers who shrieked at every step as their
wounds bled afresh went tearing through the streets to add
to the general terror and dismay while thousands of infu-
riated mexican soldiers poured along the streets for rapine
and plunder

  women and children fled to the ball-rooms where prepa-
rations had been made for celebrating the victory which
general arista had promised them and tore the flags
wreaths and ornaments from the wnlls here they were
found by scores of lawless rancheros who burst upon them
in the hurry and heat of uncontrollable passion

  crime revelled that night in the halls and better resi-
dences of matamoras

  the inhabitants believed that general tavlor would cross
the river and atfack the city and those possessing valua-
bles secured them and fled to the country but the evil
spirit of robbery and rapine encountered them there also
and the nnfortnnte exiles were overtaken and robbed and
murdered without hindrance or mercy matamoras suf-
fered more at the result of resaca de la palma from her
own citizens than from the sword of the enemy

  the american army followed so closely upon the retreat-
ing mexicans that they could easily have slaughtered more
of them had they not been ordered to cease firing and to
camp on the shores of the rio grande opposite to the
frightened and demoralized city of matamoras

  captain walker however was ordered to cross with his
own men and supported by two companies of infantry for
the pnrpose of watching the maneuvers of the enemy his
landing and camp on the other side being protected by a
batten of eighteen-pounders and the fort lower down

  he selected companies a and b mississippi volunteers
they being in better condition than any of the others and
without loss of time the crossing was effected and a lodg-
ment made on undoubted mexican soil young captain
walker being the first to plant an american flag there

  the mexicans however were too much broken and de-
moralized to offer any resistance or opposition

  elam baxter was of course among the company having
escaped all harm during the battle and after his return
from the scouting he and his company had been sent to
another portion of the field where they were held in re-
serve

  elam had been a favorite with his company from the
first but after serving general taylor so handsomely he
was regarded as a genuine hero he was full almost to
bursting with patriotic enthusiasm and his quaint speeches
kept everybody in good humor in fact he was a good
match for hank dalton of he texas rangers either in
making fun or telling stories

  about nine oclock and after walkers men had partaken


bravest of the brave

of their supper the horses cared for and the guards set
the mayor of the city came into his camp with a flag of
truce and asked for a detachment of soldiers to defend the
residences of certain wealthy citizens in imminent
danger of being pillaged by the lawless rancheros who were
prowling about the city in quest of plunder and revenge
even some of general canales men together with the baud
of outlaws under romano falcon were among the most
dreaded in fact tte better portion of the citizens feared
canales himself

  captain walker declined to grant his request as it ex-
 ceeded his orders but promised to communicate with gen-
 eral taylor on the subject and follow his instructions

  goldarn my buttons if they arent eatin each other
 up said baxter after hearing of the petition

  waal if thar stomicks can stand it we can said hank
 dalton

  captain walkers messenger returned from general tay-
 lors headquarters with this reply

  captain- waiker  keep your eye on the enemy above
 nil things but use your own judgment regarding the affair
 you mentioned	z tayloh

  that settles it said walker and he at once made ar-
 rangements for the security of his eamp after which he
 selected twenty-five men from the infantry and his own
 company to accompany him on an expedition into the
 heart of the city leaving the comp in command of lieu-
 tenant hank dalton

  as walker rode into the square he was approached by a
 mstbeautiful senorita one of the lovely spanish maidens
 of whom poets write and rave she was beautiful indeed
 but her general appearance betokened extreme anguish and
 fear

  senor americano said she catching at the bridle of
 walkers horse we are being robbed and pillaged by
 rancheros come and defend us

  where senorita

  a hundred rancheros are pillaging our homes just above
 here pity us senor americano said she in earnest but
 mournful tones

  will some one guide us to them

  i will senor

  but you are not mounted and in this wild panic might
 le trodden under foot and killed said he holding up his
 hand to those who followed as a signal for a halt

    but i can ride senor said she archly casting glances
 at a seat behind his saddle

  with me

  si senor

  good your hand

  taking her by the hand and removing his foot from the
 stirrup she lifted her own into it with ease and grace and
 he drew her up to a seat behind him in less time than it
 takes to write it

  can you ride there senorita

  si senor spnr on said she adjusting herself and
 placing one of her bare white arms around his waist

  walker turned to his command who had by this time
halted just behind

  forward march and putting spurs to his horse he
led the way directed by the beautiful girl who rode behind
him

   i swow to gracious the captings picked up a gal
said baxter in high glee at the same time looking around
to see if some such good fortune did not await him

chapter vii

a fight with the pillagers

  sea reel- a word passed between captain walker and the
beautiful mexican girl who had flown to him for protection
against the rancheros who had taken advantage of the gen-
eral panic which followed the defeat of the army of arista
at resca de la palma and whom he had assisted to a seat
behind him on his own gallant steed

  the command dashed after its leader as he sparred
through a wide square and into a street leading from it in
a westerly direction

  they imd not galloped a dozen rods before they came
upon a band of more than fifty fierce-looking rancheros
loaded with spoil and going from liqiit to house robbing
murdering outraging and producing the utmost terror
among the shrieking inhabitants of the locality one of the
best in matamoras one or two houses in the row had been
fired by the rascals to further the work of intimidation
un shots were occasionally heard above the confusion and
yells and curses greeted the ear on every side as walker and
his troop dashed upon the scene

  you must alight now senorita said he

si senor-thanks she said leaping lightly down

   i trust we may nieet again

  yes adios and she waved her hand laden with a
kiss as he wheeled his horse awav

   draw sabers charge  he called drawing his own and
spurring his eager horse

  the command was quickly obeyed and headlong rode
those gallant fellows charging fiercely upon the swarms of
i under-laden robbers who thronged the street felling them
on either side and instantly producing the wildest panic
and consternation

  i hose who did not fall under the flashing broad-swords
of the rangers threw down their plunder and took to their
heels crying

  americanos-americanos

  in ten minutes every rascal who had not fallen had him-
self out of the neighborhood leaving the most of their plun-
der behind scarcely one of them attempted any resist-
ance and many of them who had no time to mount their
waiting horses left them as prizes to the rangers who were
not slow in appropriating them

    hen all was over  alker drew up his men in the mid-
dle of the street for the purpose of learning what the casu-
alties hod been if any and of awaiting events

  not one of his men had received a scratch even and
while they were thus assembled walker wjs approached by
the same beautiful mexican girl leaning m the arm of u
bravest of

 fine looking old gentleman and evidently one of considera-
 ble importance

 thanks senor eapitan said she my father senor
 gabella also wishes to thank you

 the old gentleman approached and extended his hand to
 walker who still sat in his saddle

 young captain you may be an enemy of our govern-
 ment and its mad policy but you are certainly a friend to
 civilization and order in the name of the people of mata-
 moras i thank you for this protection said he in firm
 good english

 can i be of any further service to you

 you have done your work well and as a slight token of
 our gratitude will not you and your men accept our hospi-
 tality

 captain walker turned to his men

 what say you comrades

 gosh darn yes if the old rooster wants ter treat dont
 lets tear a shingle off his hoftse by not takin in his
 provinder said baxter

 by this time the troop was surrounded by a large con-
 course of ladies and gentlemen each of which seemed
 anxious to extend to them some token of gratitude

 very well baxter you take one-half of the command
 and i will remain with the other until your return said
 walker resolved on being prepared for any emergency

 not by a gowamed sight capn unless you command
 it said baxter saluting

 i command said walker calmly

 that ere settles it eapn and wheeling around he
 selected about one-half the troop who at once dismounted
 and followed several of the citizens into their houses where
 preparations were at once made to give them a banquet

 senor gabella hastened back to his mansion to make
 preparations for the reception of the americans with their
 captain after baxter returned with his squad but his
 daughter bianca remained near walker holding his horse
 by the bridle rein while conversing with him upon the
 tragic events of the past few hours

 she seemed greatly taken with the brave young officer
 us he was with her and in spite of the grim subject on
 which they were conversing there were lights in the eves of
 lth which plainly showed that it would have been easy to
 have entirely forgotten that the blast of war was even
 sounding in their ears and both their hearts to have fallen
 into the melody of a softer hymn

 presently however baxter and his men came out of the
 houses where they had been entertained so sumptuously
 and at once went to saddle again although it was plain to
 bo seen that the wine they had drank had put them upon
 their metal and that they were feeling first-rate

 baxter approached and saluted his captain

 you were well received he asked

 well captain i never seen such wine such grub an
 such girls since t was born go in an try em

 you will come senor eapitan said bianca appeal-
 ingly

 you shall command senorita

 then come

 baxter dont let yottr enthusiasm run away with you

the brave	

keep a sharp watch on everything and everybody until i
return

  watch why capting i wont let a flea bite my boss
that i dont go for him

  very well remember saying which he threw himself
from his saddle and giving the reins to baxter he offered
his arm to the beautiful mexican maiden and led her away
to the most pretentious mansion on the street followed by
the others of his men who had not yet been received

  on entering the mansion he was greeted by a bevy of
beautiful mexican women and quite a number of the bet-
ter class of mexican gentlemen merchants and professional
men who also welcomed him and his free rough riders to
their homes and their hospitalities

  he found as he might have expected that feeling ran
high regarding the war which had just now opened between
the united states and mexico and opened so disastrously
for them but with high good taste he took no part in the
controversies brought up and simply proclaimed himself an
officer acting under a higher authority bent solely upon
doing his duty

  senor gabella conducted walker and his men to a spa-
cious chamber wherein had been spread a long table cov-
ered with all sorts of rare fruits and wines and in the name
of the people of matamoras welcomed him and his to the
bounty he had helped to protect the house was ablaze
with light

  it is needless to say that the men fell to with that rough
zest which characterized them in everything they did and
to make the banquet all the more agreeable and attractive
a beautiful mexican lass or ladv stood by each of them
and served them with her own hands

  captain walker was of cotirse attended by the beautiful
senorita bianca and it was evident to all that the longer
they were in each others company the more they became
interested in each other and the more they seemed to be
lost to everybody around them she clung closely to the
brave young officers side and he seemed to see no other
lights than those which flashed from her sparkling black
eyes

  but trouble was brewing for them

  several times during the reception walker had noticed a
tall dark man dressed in the uniform of a mexican officer
of the higher grade pass and repass them on the opposite
side of the table at which they stood eyeing him with a
look of the most intense hate and finally finding that he
seemed to be well known and respected bv the mexicans
present he ventured to ask bianca who he was

  you have heard of canales senor

  yes i heard of him and have fought with him proba-
bly he recognizes me and for that reason he is taking par-
ticular pains to frown upon me so offensively every time i
catch his eye said he with some warmth

  peace senor it is not that alone she said placing
her hand familiarly upon his arm

  not that alone what else could it lie

  i will tell you my father is very rich and i am his
only child lie was at one time the chief justice of mexico
but differing in politics with the present government he
lias licen thrown aside to make room for montague this
canales is a brave man in his way and is famous for many
	bravest of

 things a very few of which ray father applauds he man-
 ages to maintain his position in life although it is greatly
 suspected that he is the chief of the very runeheros who
 were pillaging us to-night and whom you so gallantly drove
 away

 ah that accounts for it still further said walker

 no is this all he has long been a suitor for my hand
 in marriage said she blushing

  indeed

 si senor but my father will not listen to his suit and
 he knows that i detest and dread him in whatever shape he
 presents himself

 but why is he tolerated here

 because of the political position which he holds for in
 spite of the general suspicion which tarnishes his name he
 is an acknowledged power in the land

 but he evidently does not ibve me perhaps because of
 my success over him in the field of battle and perhaps be-
 cause-

 he paused and looked down into her beautiful face

 i understand you senor capitan he frowns because
 i smile upon you and because you routed his rancheros

 his rancheros are you sure

 common report says he is the secret chief of them

 then i understand it all would you have me resent
 his impudent stare

 no not unless he insults yon on your own account
 this is all on my account senor said she smiling

 very well i shall be guided by you

 hardly had lie finished speaking and while they were
 pledging each other in a glass of wine canales in an angry
 mood strode past them and struck the glass which walker
 held to the floor

 quick as a flash walker sent out his right hand and
 felled the insulting bully to the floor

 in an instant there was a rush and the wildest confusion
 imaginable women shrieked and men drew their weapons
 for instant use

 canales attempted to arise but walker drew his sword
 and held him to the floor

 apologize or you shall never arise without further deg-
 radation said he

 bianca dung to him and her father pressed forward to
 restore peace

chapter vi

sometuinci little aside

 you arc a coward thus to take advantage of a man
 said canales

 you lie if you say i am a coward

 you have friends here

 and so have you

 mut yours outnumber mine

 ill send them all away and light you in any style you
 may name get up

 canales struggled to his feet

 at hint moment senor gabella forced his way between
 them

tiih brave

  peace gentlemen in my house and in the presence
of ladies peace  say nay i command said the old
man fiercely

  senor gabella i was the first assaulted and insulted as
your daughter can attest said walker

  that i admit said canales and on account of the
ladies present i apologize-that is to them-but to you
senor capitan may i hope that we may be enabled to settle
our differences at some other time and place said canales

  name your time and place senor said walker haugh-
tily

  to-morrow at noon at a point outside of matamoras
of which you will be well informed

  it is well i will meet you you know where a message
will find me and he handed him a plain card with his
name on it to which he had added in pencil his rank and
address

  you shall hear from me said canales striding from
the room the rangers frowning upon him as he did so

  that means a duel senor said bianca

  i am aware of that fact my lady he replied

  but i thought you north americans never dueled

  we always resent insults and at the same time try to
accommodate those who insult us if they have the courage
to demand satisfaction

  you are rash captain said senor gabella for
canales is accounted the best shot and swordsman in mexr
ico

  i may be defeated by him senor but i can try hard not
to be said walker modestly

  spoken like a brave soldier said the old man extend-
ing his hand one thing i can assure you of there is not
an honest man or woman in matamoras or mexico either
for that matter who would not rejoice at your success over
him

  i am so sorry that this has transpired said bianca
taking the arm which walker offered as he conducted her
from the refreshment room to the parlor where there was
music

  i am sorry that it transpired in your presence

  but will you meet him

  to be sure if he gives rue a chance and general taylor
does not prevent it

  the beautiful girl remained silent and thoughtful and
her father conducted them to the center of the room where
a large number of gayly dressed people were gathered and
there introduced him to them it was a personal continua-
tion of the ovation which before then had only been gen-
eral and young walker found himself a worshiped hero

  but walker felt it to be his duty to return to the camp
where he had left hank dalton in command for he could
not even guess what had taken place during his absence
and lesides there might be other localities where his pres-
ence was needed

  so lie ordered his men to horse and lingered onlv a mo-
ment to converse with the beautiful bianca who clung to
him and appeared loth to allow of a separation

   it is against the rules of your army to engage in duels
is it not she asked

  it is but we sometimes step outside of those rules if
it can be done without tlie knowledge of our superiors
bravest of the brave



  but if your commanding general should know of it be-
forehand he would prevent it would he not

  most undoubtedly rut have no fears for me bianea
i shoot and fence tolerably well and besides being the
challenged party  can choose any weapons  like

  but what one will you choose

  well  have not made up my mind yet but rest in
peace you shall hear from me again never fear

  i-i might hear of your death senor capitan for this
canales is a very mad very dangerous man

  but none the more to be feared on that account adieu
if i am quartered near you for any lengtli of time may i
hope to see you often  he asked taking her hand in his as
he lingered by the front door

  i should be only too happy to see you-see you every
day senor said she blushing slightly

  farewell and raising her beautiful hand to his lips
he turned away and vaulted into his saddle kissing his
hand back to her as lie did so then quickly giving orders
the squadron wheeled to the right and galloped away to-
ward the great square

  iosh ail hemlock but arent she just a reglar rumbus-
tic beauty said baxter as they rode away darn em
all they every mother son on em get a darned sight bet-
ter lookin gal than i did jest my confounded luck ter
get next to an old cross-eved gal that stuck ter me like a
flea ter a vagrant dog but its all right ill make a sen-
sation mong em afore i skip out

  at the head of his brave squadron of rangers walker
rode through the city but encountered only one other gang
of rancheros whom he dispersed even quicker than he did
the first in fact the genera panic and the belief that
general taylors army was about taking possession of the
city drove arista and his broken army out ot it into the
country and nearly all of the rancheros and cut-throats
had followed leaving the city nearly deserted save by
women and non-combatants

  on returning to camp walker found everything quiet
and an hour or two was spent in talking over the events of
the day and evening before the rangers turned in for the
night it had indeed been a glorious day-one in which
a little army of gallant spirits had made one of the most
brilliant pages in the great book of history

  good-night hank i may want you for a little private
business to-morrow said walker as he was about to retire
for the night

  all right cai im yer grasshopper said the brave
rough-and-ready ranger

chapter ix

the duel

  the next day was one of bustle and activity notwith-
standing the last sad rites were being performed for so
many gallant fellows who had fallen in battle

  captain walker held matamoras and at ahout noon he
was visited by general tavlor and stntt to whom he re-
ported his actions and was warmly applauded

  while he was speaking a mexican came through the
lines and handed a letter to the general and then with-
drew

  the old hero read it and glanced anxiously at walker
  this will never do captain walker he said sternly
  what general

  this duel with canales you failed to report that part
of your doings last night this letter informs me of it

  general i was wrong in not doing so but be insulted
me in the presence of ladies at the house of senor gabella
for which i promptly knocked him down on regaining
his feet he intimated that he would meet me somewhere on
the outskirts of the city to-day

  but have you received the challenge yet

  no general i have heard nothing from him but who
could have sent you this letter

  he never suspected bianca gabella

  he might have sent it himself to prevent the meeting
said the old man smiling but he is a desperate scoun-
drel and a noted duelist

  so i am told

  but von must not meet him

  general if-

  not a word you are worth a dozen of him and should
he succeed in killing you it would deprive me of a valuable
soldier that i cannot afford to lose besides it is unfair
gineral if verll low me ill comerdate that ar
greaser instead of the cap said hank dalton who was
standing by

  no-no i will not hear of it

  then i have another proposition said he

  what is it

  capn walkers the challenged party an has a rigjit
ter chuse his weepins now seein as how he thinks ter
get the best of him on count of his bein a reglar duelist
suppose we have a little fun ont of the fair if he sends a
challenge let him answer yes an say as how hell meet him
with brass five-pounders at a hnndred yards

  the old general laughed heartily and walked away with-
out making any reply leaving them to understand that he
should not oppose a little fun of that kind and so the two
officers shook hands over it

  in the course of half an hour the challenge arrived
couched in the most hyperbolic language and assuring
walker that he should only be too ready to meet him any-
where with any sort of weapons he might name but sug-
gested a level field on the shores of the rio grande about
two miles above the city as a convenient place to fight

  walker who had entered into the sport of the affair at
once replied accepting his challenge and naming five-
pound brass pieces at one hundred yards as the weapons
to be used

  it is needless to say that canales was highly enraged at
this but he had written the young american such a pre-
sumptuous challenge that he felt that he coaid not possibly
back out now and so with curses loud and deep upon the
mean yankees trick he egan to make preparations

  as the hour approached walker took with him hank
dalton and baxter as seconds and live members of his
company to drag the field-piece to the scene of action and


bravest of the brave

they arrived there amid much jollity only about ten min-
utes ahead of cannles

  both dalton and baxter were quite used to dueling and
meeting canales seconds they arranged the preliminaries
after several protests on the part of the mexicans and
finally the ground was marked out the two cannons placed
in position and loaded with solid shot and canales and
walker were given torches and placed at their respective
guns

  each man stood about a yard from his gun and each was
then allowed three minutes to sight it upon the other after
which at tiie word one they were to lift their torches
at two they were to hold them over the priming of the
guns nd at three they were to apply them

  walker was of course perfectly at home in this artillery
practice and canales was not although the advantage
was no more on his part than it would have been on tho part
uf the wily mexican had walker consented to fight him
with either pistols or swords

  each conformed to the word and lit three both pieces
exploded canales bullet whistled past about a yard from
walker whilst that sent by the young american soldier
went to it mark like a parthian arrow

  a ery of horror went up from the americans for they
had not expected this but the mexican- innghed derisively
picked up tiie body of their fallen principal placed it in a
covered ambulance aud taking their gun they hurried bv
n roundabout road back to matamoras leaving the ameri-
cans standing there in wonder

  but presently a mexican peasant joined lliem he too
was smiling as though something exceedingly funny had
taken place and when questioned informed them that a
trick had been played upon them that a common soldier
dressed to suit had been substituted for canales and that
the general had ridden back to matamoras all unharmed

  waal gosh durn my buttons said baxter that may
be awful funny for them hut i wonder what that ar other
greaser thinks about it

  ill be eternally hornswoglled if that arent the dnrnest
meanest piece of business that i ever hearn tell on added
dalton

  tt was contemptible and worthy of a mexican general
said walker but we shall meet again

chapter x

the vtctoiuona americans

  everything was now in readiness for general taylor and
his little army of victors to cross the rio grande and take
possession of matamoras

  arista and his army together with such citizens is clung
to his fortunes were in full retreat

  captain walker and his little command although rein-
forced with the remainder of the texan rangers still held
their camp in the heart of the eitv while the main army
under taylor was encamped a mile or so outside of the
city limits and a portion of it under general twiggs
marched for sefalvo for the purpose of keeping track of
the mexican army

 baxter was very attentive to his love as was walker to
 bianca gabella but like him he had a rival although
 general canales had long ago marched with aristas army
 to the interior leaving the young american oflicer master
 of the field for the present

 baxters rival was a pompons fiery mexicau youth full
 of wealth and consequence and not inclined to allow any
 other shadow than his own to fall athwart his mistress
 threshold

 his name was muelo and he claimed to be descended
 from a long line of spanish hidalgos in whose veins ran the
 purple blood of ferdinand and isabella and she was known
 in monterey as the senorita alvia portabello also claiming
 high lineage

 she was very handsome and very much of a flirt and
 nothing seemed to delight her more than to have half a
 dozen lovers on the string and keep one set against the
 other she seemed to grow even more beautiful under the
 excitement

 baxter had met her in the course of his duty as assistant
 provost marshal of matamoras after its formal surrender
 to general taylor and fallen deeply in love with her she
 had encouraged his attentions and even led him to believe
 that he was the favored one above all others

 finally the existence of a rival ijccame known to the
 high-toned mexican lover and he at once proceeded to as-
 certain his rank and condition for being exceedinglv
 high-toned he could not tarnish his escutcheon by quarrel-
 ing with anybody beneath him

 but when he found that baxter was only a private
 soldier or at best a brevet- ieutenant his disgust knew no
 bounds and he simply said he should horsewhip him at the
 first meeting and give him a lesson that he would not
 forget

 of course such a threat was not long in getting legs and
 not long in reaching the ears of baxter and as may well be
 supposed it woke up a nest of hornets

 hank dalton was the one who conveyed the news to him
 for he delighted in anything which would break the mo-
 notony of camp life and those who knew him will feel as-
 sured that the smallest favors in this respect would be ac-
 ceptable

 what s that hank this ere blue-blooded rooster go-
 in tor horsewhip me on sight said he

 thats what i beam ole man replied dalton

 great thunder and baxter leaped to his feet

 dont get cited bax said he laughing

  cited  don t got- say hank want ter go long

 with me for a circus

 a what asked hank still laughing

 i dont mind if its goin tor lie somethin citin
 waal ill try to make it interestin he is a-goin ter
 hosswhip me hey

 all right come long with me

 hold on jot tor see the cap fust

 oh hell let u go

bravest of the brave	

 

   they went to captain walker who was then in com-
  mand and asked half a days leave of absence this was
  readily granted for life was dull in camp and had settled
  down to simple routine duty while taylor was making
  preparations for following the enemy towards monterey
  with his now augmented army of anxious volunteers rep-
  resenting nearly everystate in the union

   so the two friends started in the direction of the resi-
  dence of elams lady love taking a glass or two of wine on
  the way and discussing the prospect of fuu they were
  both armed of course but neither of them thought of using
  their weapons except in case of emergency

   they met with no particular adventure until they
  reached the house of the inamorata and just then they
  espied muelo coming from the house she had followed
  him to the door and was in the act of parting with him
  seenfingly as cordially as she had ever parted with him and
  this gave our yankee lover the first set-back and the demon
  of jealousy at once took possession of his breast

   gosh all hemlock she seems ter kinder cotton ter him
  said baxter

   of course she does you aint no sort of a chap for
  these mexican gals

   maybe not hut til bet a cow agin a can of spruce gum
  that  ken lick the beeswax out of that yer chap in ten
  minits said baxter clenching his fists

   hail him said hank after he had left the house and
  was just coming out upon the street

   hail him ill nail him snid baxter and walking
  across the street he approached his rival who was walking
  briskly and smilingly away

   walking directly up to him he said

   say yn my names elam w baxter want ter take a
  bite of me

   i dont know you said muelo attempting to avoid him
  and pass along

   swaller yer words or ill give yer an interduction
  thatll make yer head swim said baxter

   what do you mean fellow

  gin it out as how yerd hosswhip me on sight now du it
  if yer said so an if yer didnt say so say so

   dont aggravate me fellow or i may become danger-
  ous

   consarn yer pieter thats just what i want yer tu du
  yer a half-breed a greaser

    beware of me sir said be trying to get away

    lick him for fun bax said dalton who stood near at
  hand

   skin my buttons if i dont said he and knocking
  down a pistol which the mexican had drawn in the mean-
  time he sailed into him yankee fashion and gave him
  such a drubbing as the snob never met with before

   give him one for me bax

   there ye are and he did it

   now one fur the american eagle

   an thars one for ther burd of freedom said baxter

administering a parting kick which materially assisted
muelo in his homeward flight

  good boy

  hows that for gettiu a eowhidin

  warnt much cow hide bout dat   be continerly
hornswoggled if thar war said dalton

  come tu think on it hank thar was jist a grain of cow
hide bout it

  whar

  in the toe of my bute which i sent in under his coat-
tails with the compliments of the american eagle said
baxter laughing

  thats so bax and he joined in the laugh but
lets call on the gal he added

  all right an ill show you one of the goldurncdest al-
firedest purty she greasers yer ever snapped yer eyes on
come along and lie at once began to slick himself up a
bit

  the servant at once admitted them and his beautiful
mistress tendered them both a kindly and cordial reception
just as much delighted apparently as though he had not
been a moment before knocking the tar out of her other
admirer alvia portabello was really a very accomplished
lady and after conducting them to an arbor where some re-
freshments were served she entertained them with her
guitar a male and female attendant then danced the fan-
dango before them

  bax  think as how ill take a slip of that thar fan-
dango myself said dalton springing to his feet while the
smitten yankee sat looking foolishly into the eyes of his
charmer

  go it hank said he

  and hank did go it being an expert in this peculiarly
spanish dance and in spite of his uncouth proportions he
followed the pretty little dancing maid through its intrica-
cies with more grace and suppleness than one would have
believed him to possess

  this performance pleased their fair entertainer very
much and she laughed so delightedly over it that baxter
felt mad because he had not danced it himself

  you dance exceedingly well senor snid she

  waal i dont know bout that but  guess i dance ex-
ceedingly strong said hank

  some more refreshments followed and after many at-
tempts on the part of baxter to tear himself away they
at length took their leave with a pressing invitation to call
again

  call agin great thunder hed call and stay the rest
of his natral boru days said hank as they started from
the gate

  the rippling laugh which she gave voice to as she sa-
luted them with her fan had scarcely died away when they
were confronted by half a dozen armed ruffians led by
muelo

  heres the rest of yer circus bax said dalton draw-
ing his revolver

  oh yer come back for some more hey said baxter
addressing their leader

  at them was his only reply

  his cowardly hirelings were about to spring upon them
with their huge knives when they both darted to one side


bravest of the brave

and opened fire upon them knocking three or four of them
over so that they couldnt be stood up again and then the
others took to their heels and quickly disappeared in the
neighboring gardens

  both hank and baxter sent shots after them but be-
 yond wounding mnelo they did no further damage that
 they could see

  right smart i reckon said baxter extending his
 hand to dolton wonder if they want any more of the
 american eagle

  they dont act as though they did hello whats this
 ere he asked picking up a letter which mnelo had
 dropped in his flight its a letter wonder whats in
 it and lie proceeded to read why make gun meat of
 me if it aint a letter from canales an it has somethin
 ter say bout the mexican army we must take this right
 t r captain walker and away they went leaving a most
 bitter enemy behind them

chapter xt

another encounter

  hank dalton could not read spanish very well and so
 on bin return he gave the letter to captain walker who
 rend it attentively

  this letter is of importance said he lieutenant
 diilton ride directly to headquarter and place it in gen-
 eral taylors hands

  away  go cap said he saluting

  tell him all particulars nbont it

   all cap asked dalton while a big good-natured
 grin overspread his features

  certainly all why not

  wani cap ver see we was out on a little sort of a gal
 scrape for rax here an--

   ill tell yer how twas cap said baxter

  be quick then

  baxter then related the circumstances

  thats all right simply report that you were coming
 from the house tliar you were attacked by ruffians and one
 if them dropped ibis letter now ride without further
 delay and deliver it

  all right and away he went

  baxter return to your post and allow no one inside of
 the lines without a pass from headquarters go at once

  wonder what in thunders up now he muttered as
he turned away

  captain walker at once issued like orders to the guard
 in various portions of the camp and seeing everything in
 proper shape he waited for any command that might come
 from lienernl taylor

  but he had not long to wait

  the letter as before stated was written by canales to
 muelo and showed that there was a movement on fqpt on
 his purt to ride upon matamoras with about one thousand
 desperate rancheros who were to make a sudden dash in-
 fliet all the damage possible upon the little garrison then
 under walker and take all the plunder that could be car-

 ried away and then be off again into the interior before a
 sufficient number of the enemy could be brought against
 them to endanger their raid

  in a postscript canales said

  spoils or patriotism do not actuate me so much as a
thirst for revenge t shall most likely receive another
chance to meet that north american cur who insulted me
publicly at the house of senor gabella be ready with your
followers to second me

  general taylor understood the matter instantly and at
once prepared for it by sending general worth over with
his division with instructions to reinforce captain walker
and enable him to meet canales

  but there was no bustle or show that being purposely
avoided so as not to inform the friends of canales that his
plot had been discovered on the contrary the troops
were moved in small bodies and located in different piaces
about the city while general worth and captain walker
agreed upon n plan of operations the execution of which
was to be left to the latter and he was only too anxious for
the opportunity of again meeting his personal enemy and
protecting the better class of the inhabitants of matamoras

  and the bold texan rangers were delighted at the pros-
pect of a little activity for since the last battle they had
done nothing but loaf and enjoy life as it is to be enjoyed
in mexico

  baxter was again returned to his regiment a portion of
which was to take part in the coming contest

  dam my picter i dont like this said lie

  why not asked some of his comrades

  cos i want to ride a mule or a boss an sail in heavy
with capn walker an his boys said he

  oh i guess youll have it warm enough with us nns
said the other laughing

  no sir-boss i know what walker ii do hell do
all the greaser killin himself and all we shall hev tu du is
guard duty an hurraying

  scouts were sent out in the direction of where canales
was supposed to be and the next day they reported that
he was within ten miles of the city and that it was his
intention to dash upon it early the following morning

  everything was arranged to give him a warm reception
although his friends in the city knew nothing of it so
quietly had things been managed

  walker and his rangers had been posted about a mile
from the city on the maleo road but completely hidden by
some woods about half a mile from the turnpike half a
mile nearer to the city about five hundred infantry under
colonel davis were concealed in an old tannery

  it was just about daybreak when canales appeared at the
head of fully five hundred mounted rancheros the ionghest
set of people in mexico and rode proudly along until
he had got past the woods where walker and his rangers
were concealed

  to saddle said he calmly

  the men had been anxiously waiting for this order for
quite a while and it was obeyed with alacrity

  see that every piece is loaded ride cautiously until
yon get the word to charge and then show vour metal
forward said walker

  his answer was to spring at mo in wild rage i knew from
this that i had guessed his secret

  we all withdrew from the cell and at the first opportunity
i had an interview with one of the physicians of the institu-
tion and told him what i knew about thompson i also told
him that there was very little doubt of the existence of the
deposit of gold and that thompson could lead us to it

  the physician had previously informed me that the patient
was sometimes to all purposes perfectly sane for weeks and i
now suggested that the next time one of those lucid intervals
occurred we should see what we could do with him the doc-
tor agreed

me that thompsou had entered upon one of his lucid spells
r immediately went up to the asylum

  in company with the doctor i entered thompsons cell and
entered into conversation with him his talk was quite ra-
tional and in the course of half nn hours interview he ap-
pealed to me to get him out of the asylum

 this was our chance

 the doctor immediately offered to free him from the
asylum if he would show us the way to that point indicating
it with his finger on the map thompson hesitated a moment
but presently consented

  this was all we wanted

  there was no difficulty in getting him out of the asylum

by col ralph fenton

   a reporter of the helena montana independent had a
 conversation with one of a party of three men who have spent
 tiie past summer in searching for the lost cabin about
 which there was so much discussion in this territory several
 jcare ago it was built by a party of four men who in 
 made a wonderful discovery of gold at a point supposed to
 be somewhere near the hue between montana and wyoming
 in less than a week after discovery was made a party of hos-
 tile indians made a descent on the discoverers and killed all
 but one of them the surviver a man named thompson
 made his appearance in alder gulch and set the camp on
 fire with the tale of the wonderful discovery which he and his
 companions had made the discovery was said to consist of
 a ledge of quartz several feet in width with streaks of pure
 gold running through it averaging from one to seven inches
 wide the story was marvelous and if the public pulse bad
 not at that time been in a feverish condition on account of the
 vast quantities of the precious metal then being taken out
 weekly from the placers of alder gulch its truth might have
 been questioned but under the circumstances no one thought
 of doubtiug it for an instant especially when thompson ex-
 hibited several ragged chunks of gold that had the appear-
 ance of having been broken from a mass of glittering metal
 and this thompson asserted was the case the camp went
 wild a hundred men stood ready and anxious to follow
 thompson to the spot if he would lead them but thompson
 suddenly disappeared and afterwards news came of his death 
 in the big horn country

	i had been in california several years said the late
 searcher when in company with a friend i visited the state
 lunatic asylum this was in the winter while going
 through the asylum the warden called our attention to a pe-
 culiar case in his charge it was a man who occupied all his
 time in drawing rough diagrams or maps on the walls of his
 cell these drawings were all alike and the walls and floor
 of his cell were covered with them they were of some moun-
 tainous country with a river running through it from the
 south and a smaller stream putting into the river from the
 east in about the center of the map from the point of junc-
 tion of these two streams a line was drawn due south to a
 peak marked three miles and thence it continued in a zig-
 zag line a southerly direction with the length of each straight
 iine marked at the extreme end of the line a circle was
 drawn with a cross in the center as soon as i looked at the
  razy map-maker i recognized him it was thompson i was
 subsequently told that after going from montana to california
 h had lost all his money and then was taken with a fever
 he was adjudged insane and sent to the asylum where i
 found him he had been there three years

   we stepped into the cell i examined the maps on the wall
 and asked thompson about them he seemed willing enough
 to talk about other matters-in a disjointed manner how-
 ever-hut concerning his map he would not say a word

   on finding that the man was thompson it immediately oc-
 curred to me that the map was intended to show the point at
 which the lost cabin and the wonderful deposit of gold were
 located and the questions which i asked were propounded
 with a view of getting a clew after questioning him unsuc-
 cctsfully for some time i put my finger on the circle in the
 nioy and asked him

   -	is this gold

journey in a few days we found ourselves in the park and
well on our way to the big horn mountains in which thomp-
son said the gold mine was located in three more days we
reached the big horn river and traveled up it to the mouth
this was on the th of june

 thompson had up to this time acted as naturally as any
of us in addition to the doctor and myself we had brought
along one of the asylum attendants thompson said that we
would be able to reach the gold deposit the next day and
we were all wild with excitement we camped on the night
of the th in a wild place a few miles from the river aside
from thompson we were all very tired and slept soundly
when we arose in the morning thompson was gone the ex-
citement had evidently brought on a spasm of insanity and
he had got up during the night and wandered off into the
mountains we hunted for him three days and finally found
him lying bruised and dead at the foot of a cliff fully a thou-
sand feet high in his delirium he had plunged over it to
certain death-probably the night that he fled from camp
we buried him where we found him and as a search for the
treasure would be hopeless without his assistance we turned
back the doctor and his man i left at miles city whence
they probably had gone bast as for myself  made no further
search for the lost cabin

what clock ioxes dii

 that winter we were in camp on panther creek was one
never to be forgotten even by a miner who had blasted rocks
in the h b and worked knee-deep in the cold waters of the
valleys no on was making a fair living to say nothing or
adding to the store which was to some day carry the possessor
back to the states and to wire and children

 it was not enough that times were hard the weather bad
all around weekly



and a good share of the men sick but the blacklegs came
down from thunder bend and up from aunt sallys town
and made themselves quite at home among us they were i
well stocked with whisky and gambling devices and more
than one of our men who had dug and delved for months to
get a few dollars ahead saw it pass into the hands of these
hyenas

  when richard smith lost his dust and raised a kick one or
the gamblers pul a knife into him to settle the argument
that action stirred up the town and in the row that followed
tour or five men were killed and as many more wounded
after this affair the town was pretty quiet tor a fortnight
and then occurred the incident i set out to relate

  one of the best-natured men in camp was a man from con-
necticut generally known by the name of clock jones when
lie left trlsco for the diggings he carried with him an old-
fashioned family clock and for a year or two he and the clock
were pards and traveled in company and were never out of
eight of each other in this way he came to be known by the
front name of clock and if the title did not please him no
one ever heard him object to it

  at some time in the past clock jones had been a drunkard
perhaps the fears and prayers of a loving wife had wrought
hu rescue he had braced against the awful vice and none
of us had ever known him to taste the stuff

r well it might have been curiosity that one day led the man
to enter the shanty of the worst blackleg of all if not that
then he was drawn there as fate has llrawn her victims here
and there before he was a man who would not touch cards
and as i said before we had never seen him taste liquor and
yet within half an hour after he hud entered that den he
was whooping drunk and being plucked of his money sev-
eral of his friends made efforts to get him out of the clutches
of the blacklegs but their kind words were answered by
threats and curses the man had changed from a quiet god-
fearing miner to a howling reckless brawling demon in thirty
minutes one sip of whisky had created a craving for drink
and dram had followed dra d with frightful avidity

 we couldnt let him go on in that way and finally a miner
named williams was prevailed upon to make another effort
wo selected this man because at home he was a neighbor of
jones and because he too had saved up a snug little sum and
would go home in the spring the two men after a hard days
work had sat together by the cheerful fire of evenings and an-
ticipated their return home they had planned how they
would reach home in the evening still wearing their old
clothes and long beards and rough looks and after an absence
of seven years no one would know them as they walked the
streets of the village they would quietly approach their own
homes and their knock would be answered by the wives who
had wnlted and hoped and lived by hoping he would speak
to her as a stranger and he would be on the point of turning
away when something in voice or gesture would tell her that
the long-gone husband was home at last

  so they had planned and neither had been ashamed of the
toors which welled up to his eyes at the recollections of home

  we sought out williams and entreated him to interfere to
save his friend and he walked straight to the gamblers cabin
jones had lost every dollar of his money and was fighting
drunk

  come clock-come away coaxed williams

 i wont x want more whisky nnd a chance to win my
money back  shouted jones

  for your wifes sake come away entreated williams

  i tell you i wont and if you dont jto away ill kjll you
yelled jones as ho flourished his shooter around

  williams walked over and laid his hand on his rriends
shoulder and whispered

  come old neighbor-remember wife and children
hang wife and children and you too was the fierce ex-
clamation from the maddened man and with that he fired to
kill

  the bullet did not kill indeed it did not hit williams at
all but the flame of the powder blinded him in a flash and
forever he carried his hands to his face stepped back a pace
or two and i can never forget how his voice went out to every
heart as he cried out

  oh man you have blinded me and i shall never see wlc
and children again

  the demon fled from clock joness heart as that w
reached it in a moment he was pale as death and as sov
is at any hour in his life slowly as the darkness oi h ur
was lighted up by the return of reason he comprehended w 
lie had done he looked from face to face saw the horror
resting on each countenance then he took poor will v 
hands down from his face kissed him on his cheek on 
stepped back and blew his own brains out before a hand co i
be raised to prevent him

missing links in new guinea

  across from our tropical state of queensland remarked
the australian is the most mysterious of the unexplored
corners of the earth the island of new guinea queer thing
happen there and there are still queerer things to be seen

  i used to spend nearly all my vacations cruising on the
now guinea coast and i didnt encounter any of the things
that travel books describe but i did run up against a tribe
of swamp-dwellers that came closer to supplying the missing
link than any other human beings i have ever heard or read of

  they call themselves the ahgaiambo and have lived in the
marsh country of the southeastern portion of the island for
a period that goes back beyond native tradition they use
log canoes which they propel through the miry water with
poles but for getting from one place to another depend most-
ly upon their ability as swimmers its a sight to see them
take a dive off some eminence and glide through the water
like eels passing with graceful curves through beds of reeds
or over floating masses of vegetable matter while the sunlight
sparkles on their smooth brown bodies

  i induced a man and a woman to allow me to measure
them and take their photographs both were well developed
from the hips upward with broad shoulders thick necks and
long and powerful arms their legs however were remark-
ably slight at first this puzzled me as it seemed that the
exercise of swimming should have brought all the muscles of
the body into play afterward i discovered that the ahgai-
ambo use their legs very little in the water they keep their
feet together making a sort of rudder of the lower limbs and
do all the work with their arms this emphasizes their re-
semblance to eels when in the water and accounts for the
peculiarly graceful manner in which they glide along

  the man i examined had several folds of thick skin or
muscle across the loins which concealed the outline of his
body viewed sideways his resemblance to an ape was strik-
ing one of the most surprising things about him was that
although almost exactly the same height as one of my papuan
boatmen his hips were six inches nearer the ground

  the woman was more slightly formed than her mate of
the marshes her legs were like spindles her feet were flat
and her toes stood out rigidly as though they possessed no
joints her dress was a very short skirt of native cloth

  as far as i know the ahgaiambo are not to be met with
outside of this swamp country of new guinea and have never
been studied by ethnologists


bravest of the brave

continued from page 

   scarcely imtl they gained the road before davis opened
on tho raiders willi his rifles anil lliis caused a bait and
something of a panic

   canales saw that lie had been discovered but thinking
tliat it was only a detached camp of the americans he or-
dered a charge upon the old building in which they had
taken shelter

   but the unerring rifles of the first mississippi sent
many a greaser tumbling out of his saddle

   a large number of citizens had by this time arrived
near the scene of action

   canales led the charge in person but in spite of his
bravery his men recoiled and he finally ordered a retreat
hoping he might avoid the riflemen altogether and dash
past them by taking another road further to the left

  but scarcely had his men reached a turn in the road
which screened them from the murderous rifles when
walker at the head of his rangers swept down upon them
like an avalanche firing as they came on and doing good
execution

   in an instant canales saw that he had been betrayed and
that he was probably in a trap out of which nothing but
the most desperate lighting would take him so he spurred
his horse to the front and with drawn sword sought to
rally his demoralized t roops

   but he was too late for already the rangers were upon
him with revolvers in one hand and their huge broad-
swords in the other and holding their bridles in their teeth
were carrying havoc among the mexicans and sending
llieir riderless horses galloping madly over the adjacent
fields

   shouting and foaming in his mad desperation canales
singled out walker and rode for him at the top of his
speed

   walker was aware of and eager for the meeting

   like two infuriated devils did they meet broadsword to
broadsword which flashed lightning as they clashed to-
gether

   kach reined his steed and turning rode back again for
another encounter

   four times did they ride upon each other in this des-
perate way when just as walker was about to return for
another a stray bullet shattered the fore leg of his horse
and he fell headlong upon the ground and uion his side in
such a way as to completely pin his rider to the earth

  ha now  have you shouted canales poising his
sword and riding upon him

   at that instant a mexican girl threw herself from the
horse she had been riding and shielded walkers body with
her own

   hold canales said she

   never lie hissed wheeling his horse so as to reach
walker on the other side if i did not wish to kill him
before fm bound to now

   not much i reckon yelled hunk dalton riding his
heavy horse full upon him knocking both canales and his
horse over in n confused heap uuess yer lietter take a
piece of me fust he added halting and presenting a pistol
to his head

 surrender cried canales throwing down his sword

   waal that saves yer bacon cordin to war but if i hail
my way id bore yer so full o holes that yer innardsd all

four of the rangers who were about giving chase to a dozen
rancheros as they started to escape through the woods

my horse poor fellow

  well soon fix that here boys two on yer scoop in

   rood enough cap said the brave fellow as he galloped
away

   captain walker was soon released and on his feet again
greatly to the delight of bianca gabella for she it was who
had followed her lover and-attempted to save his life

  thanks bianca you came like an angel said he
 havent time to half thank you but will do so after we
have routed these robbers let me help you to your horse
again be careful and farewell said he kissing her hand
and helping her to her saddle after which he mounted a
fresh horse and rode headlong into the tight again

chapter xii

onward to monterey

  various movements on the part of our army and wait-
ing for negotiations and instructions from washington
caused a long delay and it was not until the st of sep-
tember that further parley between the two governments
failed and general taylor was ordered to move upon mon-
terey

  the defense of this important place was intrusted to 
general ampudia the garrison was large and the works
of sufficient strength to be deemed impregnable

  ampudia issued a most bombastic address in which he
promised to wipe from the face of the sacred soil of mex-
ico every american who now had the audacity to be march-
ing towards monterey and the city was at once placed in a
state of siege

  captains walker and mcculloch had several sharp skir-
mishes on the route but they invariably beat off killed or
captured any presumptuous detachment of the enemy who
dared to make a stand

  on the tli of september general taylor halted his
armv at walnut springs three miles from monterey and
prepared for one of the most heroic and remarkable sieges
which it has ever fallen to the lot of the historian to record

  the various divisions were assigned to camping ground
and with the utmost coolness and calm deliberation did each
prepare for the work before them

  the city of monterey is one of the most beautiful in
mexico if not in the world a pen pjcture can scarcely do
it justice in fact nothing less than an actual view of it
can show its ijeauties

  it is named after the mountain kings mountain at
whose base it nestles it is at the commencement of the
sierra madre range one of the boldest in mexico
bravest of the brave



   it is about eight hundred miles from the city ol mexico
 tli san juan river runs below the city while on the op-
 posite side there is an extensive plain on which grow luxu-
 riant crops of maize sugar cane groves of apples peach
 orange and citron trees

  tiie first movement on the part of the mexicans was
 made soon after we went into camp a detachment of the
 enemys lances were observed approaching and general
 taylor ordered captain walker to charge them

   ho did so when they suddenly wheeled about and re-
 turned to the city instead of pursuing them however
 walker ordered a halt and the object of the movement was
 soon apparent the guns of the citadel suddenly opened
 with twelve-pound shot which had walker and his rangers
 been within range as ampudia calculated they would be
 would have committed fearful havoc among them

   tl lis foresight on the part of walker was highly com-
 mended by taylor who in the meantime with major
 mansfield and a party of engineers had been making a
 thorough examination of the enemys works

 jkight closed in without further demonstration from the
 mexicans and a happier more jolly army than ours could
 never have been seen from camp to camp and from mess
 to moss words of congratulation lew and wild songs of fun
 pathetic ones and those descriptive of daring deeds re-
 sounded along the line until late at night

   even the humblest soldier could see the work before
 them but every heart was nerved and every arm ready to
 meet the enemy anywhere

   the spirit of sport good fellowship and chivalry was
 abroad in our little army

hank dalton elam w baxter and several other kin-
dted spirits were assembled in daltons tent and were the
wildest and loudest in their revelry serious work was at
ljpngth before them and this if nothing else wouldhave
made them happy even to boisterousness

   cross-buttock me with a mule if things arent gittin
 to jbe just hunkv said baxter as he lifted hanks flask to
 his lips

   yas everythings hunky when you git yer sucker
 coupled with somebodvs whisky-flask said dalton half
 seri pus-half in earnest

    hank youd be right if vous goin to be hung i swar
 sajd he half in fun also

 i	waal i wouldnt like to be hung ter yer if the only
 fodder i had war whisky retorted hank at which a loud
 laugh arose from the mess

   wonder how long afore those greasers  du some-
 thin asked one of the company

   hang me if i know but you may bet yer butes that
 ole ssack wont wait for em long afore he tickles the ribs of
 tills ere royal city said hank

   and said one of the mess rising to his feet and wav-
 ing his cap

   the star spangled banner in triumph shall wave

     over monterey and many a grave

   this was sung with only that zest which soldiers in camp
 can give to such a grand old song and before they had fin-

 ished the whole encampment-flie whole army had caught
 up the glorious hymn and as it billowed out upon the air
 and reached the ramparts of monterey what a chill it must
 have sent to main a presumptuous mexicans heart who
 had perhaps dared to dream of crushing forever the bold
 little army which lay beneath them

 hardly had they finished singing when an orderly ap-
 peared before the tent and called for baxter

 right here on hand every time you bet said he com-
 ing out and saluting

 be good enough to report to general taylor at once
 said the orderly riding away

 good enough toll the ole boss that im bis chip-
 munk for anything an forever he yelled after the oflicer
 what is it bax asked hank dalton coming out
 the boss has bent for me

 what taylor

 sure pop

 bullv for you said several

 waal bax  sorter reckon as how that means biz said
 dalton

 an thats whatll cure my itch hunk

 maybe as how it will give us ver hand an if we dont
 meet agin ill alius take my solemn that yer died game

 good nough shake said he taking the hand of the
 stalwart texan after which he shook hands with other
 members of the company and at once set out for the head-
 quarters of general taylor

 arriving there he at once reported and in a few min-
 utes was admitted to his presence

 he found him in a very humble tent engaged in writing
 by the light of a very poor candle

 he never moved or looked up until he had finished his
 letter and baxter stood there all the while anxious

 finally when he had finished writing he passed the let-
 ter over to an adjutant to seal and direct and then looked
 up at baxter

 baxter

 gineral said the yankee saluting

 i am glad to see you be seated

 thankee glad tu see you gineral hope yer fust-
 class i du by gracious

 thank you i want you for dangerous work baxter
 bully for you gineral im yer crowbar all the time
 the rough old general laughed in spite of himself
 well the work i have for you might christen you a
 crowbar very appropriately i want you to disguise your-
 self somehow and work your way into monterey and there
 find out all yoocan about the garrison-how many men
 they have got at each work and in short all you can about
 everything

 as  said before gineral im ver crowbar

 well what disguise will you adopt

 ill have tu lie mexican said baxter thoughtfully
 certainly but do you speak spanish

  fust-class gineral

 so much the lietter

 ive kited all over this yer country fust an last an if
 i only had a mexican peasants toggery i could pass for a
 thoroughbred greaser

 good we mnet have such a dress said taylor turn-


bravest of the brave

 ing to one of his adjutants and conversing with him for a
 moment in an undertone	

 general there is a mexican inside of the lines now
 selling fruit whose dress will answer i think

 bring him in at once

 the adjutant saluted and was gone

 gineral howd we know that this ere fruit peddler
 arnt a spy said baxter who at once suspected that
 something might be wrong from the fact of his resolving to
 adopt that very same disguise

  well there b a bare possibility of his being one how-
  ever we will see when he comes in

 just then the adjutant returned bringing in a common
 mexican ranchero

 both taylor and baxter scrutinized him closely
 gineral ill bet my head agin a cooky that this ere
 chap arent on the square said baxter in a whisper
 who are you demanded taylor sternly

 the mexican attempted to reply in spanish

 stop give it to me in english or ill have you shot
 a poor ranchero senor americano selling fruit
 have you a pass

 si senor said he producing it

  taylor inspected it carefully

 very well if you are what you ay you are you can
 have no objection to exchanging dresses with this gentle-
 man here strip

 the mexican hesitated

 strip or ill have you stripped thundered taylor
 unharness yer meat darned quick if yer dont want ter
 have it made leaky said baxter

 the mexican glanced from one to another but finding
 nothing but stern resolution on the face of general taylor
 he began to undress

 thats jist what yer want ter du mr greaser said
 baxter commencing himself to nndress

 the mexican muttered something in spanish but went
 on with his disrobing

 taylor watched him closely and did not fail to note the
 difference between the soft olive skin as it appeared after
 his clothes had been removed and the hard bronzed face
 and hands which were displayed before undressing

 baxter got into the mexicans garb as fast as he got out
 of it and the mexican was forced into his

 now bring me soap and water said taylor and in a
 few minutes they were forthcoming greatly to the conster-
 nation of the ranchero

 baxter you see the color you want on your face and
 hands said he aside to the spy

  ill git it gineral

 tie well now wash this fellows facc and hands and
 let me see whether he looks the same

 it wont du him any hurt anyway gineral said bax-
 ter

 in spite of some resistance and many protests three or
 four orderlies seized the mexican and gave his face a goof
 washing there was a decided change in his appearance
 the dark sun-brown had given dace to an olive tint that
 was almost as delicate as that of a lady and the dirt once
 removed from his hands showed that they did not belong
 to a farmer but most likely to a person of the better class

 you are a ranchero are you said taylor with a
 sneer

 si senor

 indeed well ill keep you until to-morrow and then
 lave you shot unless you can prove who you are away
 with him under guard

 the order was instantly obeyed and in spite of his pro-
 tests the mexican was taken away a prisoner

 sarves yu right mr greaser but i may be caught in
 the same snap said baxter

 true you may but take nothing with you that will
 give you away

   bet yer butes i wont gineral but whars the chaps
 animal 

    here at hand and they both went out to inspect it

   it was a little donkey and a two-wheeled cart there
 were various kinds of fruit in the cart a portion of which
 he had sold before being apprehended

    thisll du for me gineral said baxter

   do you think so

   i du by gosh now seet tm passed outside of the
 lines an give me a special word that will get me back any
 time

   in a few moments the preliminaries were all arranged
 and baxter set off toward monterey with bis donkey-cart
 and load of fruit followed by the good wishes of all who
 knew of the dangerous mission he was going on once ont- i
 side he was lost to all but himself although he halted just i
 outside of our lines to wait for morning to come

   early the next morning he was on his way having in
 the meantime provided himself with all he wanted

    after traversing quite a distance between the lines bax-
 ter was challenged by a mexican sentry but having the
 pass which had been taken from the mexican spy he was
 passed into monterey without question and never did a-
 genuine mexican appear more like the genuine article than
 did elam w baxter

   with his eyes and ears wide open and yet being to all
 appearances a simple fruit-vender he made his way to the
 principal street called calle de monterey and which
 runs from the bishops palace through the middle of the
 city to the plaza of which it forms the west side

   through this street selling his fruit by the way he
 went and before noon had made the circuit of the citv and
 had obtained pretty accurate knowledge regarding the de-
 fenses and the number of men in each just as tavlor had
 instructed him

    it was after he had obtained all this information and was
 returning through calle de monterey on his way back to
 the american lines that he was approached by a mexican
 citizen who at once claimed to be the owner of the donkev
 and cart

   here was a complication which baxter had not provided
 for but his cheek was good in almost any emergency and
 he at once applied it

   so he buzzed the mexican and showed by hia pass that
 he was a countryman-a ranchero come in to sell fruit to
 the soldiers

   but the mexican was tenacious for he knew his prop-
 erty  ami knowing too that it had been lent to a mexican
bravest of the brave



   py he at once suspected treachery and called loudly for
     officer of the guard

   rot blast yer picter take that said baxter knocking
   he mexican sprawling

   it was a good blow and well put in but two or three
   oldiers came running up to answer the mexicans cry and
   ee what it all meant as yet the owner of the donkey had
   ot recovered

   this fellow attempted to rob me said he in good
   spanish and i flopped him over  was i right he added
   tiering a handful of oranges to the soldiers

   to be sure you was said they

   thanks and baxter drove rapidly awav

   t ie soldiers ate the oranges and regarded the stunned
   dean who still lay upon the ground before them but
   isently lie revived

      bey ridiculed him however and told him to move along
 when be attempted to explain to them they placed
 the bayonets of their guns behind him and ran him out
 of their precinct

   but fully believing that mischief was afoot the mexican
 made his way to the headquarters of ampudia and told
 his story

   general ampudia understood it at once ne had em-
 ployed this mans donkey and cart to equip one of his favor-
 ite officers who had undertaken to enter the american lines
 for the purpose of learning all he could regarding the en-
 my and if the storv this man told was true not only was
 ii probable that his officer hail fallen into the hands of
 general taylor but in adopting the same disguise another
 py had made his way into the city of monterey and with-
 out doubt had learned all he had been sent to find out

   and so general ampudia at once called around him some
 trusty men and officers and giving a description of the
 supposed american spy he bade them take him at all haz-
 ards dead or alive

   twenty horsemen instantly rode away in different direc-
 tions each eager to win the glory attending the capture
 of so important a personage on the eve of battle 

   baxter in the meantime having secured all the infor-
 mation he wanted made direct for the american lines but
 scarcely had he presented his pass the same on which he
 had entered and on which the mexican had left monterey
 and been allowed to pass than a dozen horsemen dashed
 around an angle in the road and called upon the sentry to
 stop him

   beeswax tu bake said baxter its luck fight or
 pood breedin so here goes saying which he whipped out
 liis knife and in an instant cut the donkey free from the
 eart and threw himself astride of him now go it long
 ears

   with a well-applied whip he managed to get the lazy
 donkey into a gallop but the mexican lancers were fast
 overtaking him as he made but half their headway toward
 the american lines

   as luck would have it captain walker and his men were
 stationed nearest to the point he was approaching and
 knowing that baxter might be expected at any moment he
 had been prepared all day to render him assistance should
 he need it

   and need it he did just now the fierce mexican lancers

 bent upon capturing him at all liazards were close upon
 him now and walker leaped into his saddle and called a
 few of his men to follow him

  i think that is baxter whom they are chasing quick
follow me i

  the pursuing mexicans were swooping down upon the
american spy like so many eagles upon their defenseless
prey and scarcely had they reached midway between the
american and mexican line when one of the foremost
riders threw a lasso over baxters head and pulled him from
the donkey with the utmost ease

  in an instant more walker and his men and the mexi-
cans dashed upon the scene and a spirited fight at once
resulted baxter all the while lying prone upon the ground
held in the grasp of the cutting lasso and liable to be tram-
pled to death by the horses who were plunging madly
around him

chapter xiit

tiie commencement of a memorable iegk

  the fight between captain walker with a small detach-
ment of his rangers and the mexicans who had pursued
elam w baxter out of the city of monterey and who were
 the point of capturing him for a spy was of short dura-
tion one of the mexicans was killed two wounded and
made prisoners and the others escaped back to the city

  walker at once turned to baxter who still lay on the
ground where the lasso of the mexican had thrown him
from his donkey he was bruised and bleeding from sev-
eral wounds but not hurt seriously

  is that you baxter he asked riding up to where he
lay

   i guess so capn but cut this here lasso for it is cuttin
me most alfiredly said he

  wralker got down from his horse cut the lasso and as-
sisted him to his feet

  goldum my buttons if ever i was got on a string like
that afore he muttered

  are you hurt much

  waal i dont zactly think im trench-meat yet but i
guess its bout all i want ter day capu

  get up here with me my horse is strong enough to
carry us both

  wonder where my donkey is

  over there in the corn-field tom bring in that don-
key  called walker to one of his men

  guess ill adopt that ere little cuss- now go it for
headquarters licketysplit he added and away they rode
across a maize field in the direction of taylors headquar-
ters

  the old general congratulated baxter on his escape and
the information which he brought was the very kind he
needed to enable him to proceed understanding- with he
giant task ho had set himself upon-the capture of the su-
perbly fortified city of monterey

  this information which he brought not only convicted
the mexican spy but convinced taylor that the city would
have to be attacked on both front and rear and so take
bravest of the brave

two chances of capturing it besides keeping the enemy
broken and more busy in defending against two armies in-
stead of one

  the march was taken up but it soon became evident that
the mexicans were determined to dispute the passage and
walker was ordered to join captain mcculloch in the ad-
vance

  they had not proceeded more than two miles when on
coming to a turn in the road they came upon the enemy to
the number of fifteen hundred drawn up in line of battle
and all ready to receive them

  captain walker at once ordered his men to deploy to
the right and dismount he was supported by duncans
battery and the light companies of scott and smith

  hie enemy at once opened ire in which they were
joined by the battery on independence hill the rangers
answered by a rapid fire from their trusty rifles every shot
from which meant a soldiers life

  the mexicans then prepared to charge and as walker
and a company of rangers separated from the other com-
panies he was obliged to receive the entire shock then
ensued a scene which for rapidity of movement and indi-
vidual daring was never surpassed in any battle in the
world

  then it was the hardest part of the struggle took place
daltons horse had been shot under him and he himself had
received two wounds yet on foot with his huge broad-
sword ho defended himself against three of the enemy one
of whom ho killed while the other two were pickled by his
men

  in this strait walker led the remainder of his rangers to
the rescue and soon forced his way to where they were
but what life there was left in the mexicans now was di-
rected upon these terrible texans and a lively fight they
gafe them outnumbering them as they did ten to one

  but walker and his men were equal to the emergency
although there was no hope of holding their own against
such fearful odds they literally hewed their way out of
the enemys center and rejoined the remainder of the de-
tachment with the loss of only one man

  after the action general worth moved his command
along the saltillo road and took up a strong position and
at once commenced the siege while duncans battery kept
up an artillery duel with the cannon posted on independ-
ence hill

  as soon as everything was in shape walker visited his
wounded rangers among whom was his lieutenant hank
dalton

chapter xiv

w the tidf of battfe

i

  general worth lost but little time in getting his army
into position

  when all was ready he sent for captain walker

  i have named you the bravest of the brave i now
vou are ambitious i must take federation hill yon will
take command of one of the storming parties i rely upon
you said the bluff soldier

  you may do so general said walker modestly

  i know it assume command and stand ready for or-
ders

  i hasten to obey general and saluting the young
officer rode away to his command

  a portion of this new and temporary command was com-
posed of the texan rangers dismounted and the others
were made up from various regiments all being picked
men artillery cavalry and militia

  when all was in readiness general worth rode among
the men and by a few words nerved each heart to its ap-
parently desperate task

  soldiers i want you to capture yonder height follow
your brave leader and you will do it said he

  a shout and a cheer went up and as it died away the
command forward  was given and away went as brave a 
detachment of soldiers as ever faced an enemy

  greatly to his delight flam w baxter was with that
portion of his regiment that had been detached to take part
in the terrible struggle and his quaint good-natured re-
marks kept everybody in good humor even amid the rain
of deathly hail which soon greeted them

  the brave three hundred were soon marching along the
saltillo road toward extensive fields of sugar enne which
they entered to screen their movements from the enemys
observation and falling into single file they proceeded to-
ward the river

  before reaching the intervening river the roar of cannon
from the hill told them that they had been observed and
that the remainder of their march must be through nr
shower of deadly fire

  but animated by their intrepid captain they paused not
for a moment and on reaching the river they dashed in
waist-deep while shot and shell were plunging into the
seething waters in every direction throwing it in wildlv-
dashed spray all over them

  through this terrible stream the americans rushed and
gained the opposite hank without loss a circumstance that
appears to he almost miraculous tt seemed wonderful to
us and from it we caught the feeling that we led charmed
lives and that no mexican bullet could harm us

  we reached federation hill and began the ascent and
what a task it was the hill is four hundred feet in height
and very steep and its base is covered by a dense growth of
chaparral on reaching the base of the hill captain
walker halted his men in order to make the most careful
preparation for the ascent

  during the interval large reinforcements of mexicans
poured into the fort and companies of infantry and sharp-
shooters descended from it and stationed themselves on
ledges and convenient places for the purpose of picking off
our men as they struggled gallantly upwards but without
leing able to reply to their shots

  walker sword in hand was leading the wav and strik-
ing right and left for victory but after a fierce struggle
the enemy began to waver then slowly retreat up the hill
towards the fortress closely followed by the americans
who were yelling wildly at the prospect of victory

  as the soldiers neared the fort the terrified garrison
shrank before them and without order but full of confi-
dence and daring the americans led by walker closelv
bravest of the brave



  followed by baxter rushed through tbe gates and at once
  charged upon the nine-pounders with which it was princi-
  pally armed

     a dozen of the bravest of the enemy drew their swords
   or clubbed their inuskets and made a decided stand against
  our approach walker and mills with what few followers
  had got through the gate at once charged upon them and

  ii	desperate hand-to-hand struggle ensued

     but it was of short duration only for the americans
  swarmed in upon them and they fled precipitately to
  another fort called fort soldada

     in less than five minutes after they entered the fort tbe
  mexican flag was torn down and the american flag hoisted
  in triumph in its place

     soldiers said walker we have work before us yet

    a loud cheer answered him

     that other fortress must be takeu 

     another cheer

     and that before the enemy has recovered from this lit-
  tle affair follow me forward march

with loud cheers they obeyed the order and at once the
whole force started along the sides of the hill and with
terrible impetuosity drove all opposition before them and
d those of the enemy who were stationed outside to meet the
shock quickly fled under cover

    onward flew walker closely followed by his eager
troops and attacking the fort simultaneously on several
sides quickly overcame all opposition and rushed pell-mell
 jkf to the inclosure before tbe enemy had time to evacuate it
wi the colors of the fifth infantry were quickly flying in
 the place of the mexican flag and they were soon followed
 by those of the seventh

     there was but little opposition olferod by the mexicans
tfor they seemed to have become thoroughly demoralized at
the terrific onslaught of that little handful of americans
ttiul so they surrendered at once

    tbe captured garrison numbered fifteen hundred to-
  gether with one nine-pounder alarge number of mules
  camp equipage and ammunition

     so far the victory had been complete although only one
  point of many that were even stronger had been gained

     captain walker at once secured all that be had captured
  and then turned the guns that he had takeu upon the
  bishops palace after which he wrote a dispatch to general
  worth commencing thus

     uine nrftch has been gained on the ladder of victory
  we hold federation hill according to orders and then he
  gavo a hasty account of the whole affair

     by this time night began to closo around and it was al-
  ready dark in the vale below when walker dispatched his
  messenger

     there was no other alternative left but to remain in the
  captured works until morning and to add to the discom-
  fort of the situation it began to rain hard and without
  food or shelter the captors of federation hill lay down to
  rest their weary bones

     but there was no gnimbliiig they were content with
  the victory they had won and even amid the darkness anil
  tlu storm they sang

     and the star spangled banner in triumph shall wave
     oer the land of the free and the home of the brave 

   baxter was in his glory

   wheres the chap as bet his arthly existence agin mine
that the american eagle wouldnt lay an egg in this
ere fort afore night show him ter me i want ter make
way with his consarned arthly existence

   a good-natured laugh greeted him

  walker went among his men and congratulated and con-
soled them as best he could and was by them greeted with
the wildest eheers and enthusiasm

  during the night a relief company was sent by worth
and three days rations were furnished to each man and
about midnight after having eaten hearty suppers the
soldiers laid down upon the ground with the rain beating
upon them and sought a few hours sleep

  but what dreams came to that sleeping band of tri-
umphant braves

chapter xv

once more onto the breach

   severe as had been the fighting on the st there was
yet heavier work before the assailants of federation hill
and it was generally understood among them that the
fighting they had done was but the prelude of what was to
come on the morrow

   the heights of independence ilill was still occupied by
the enemy and the works by-which it was surrounded were
to all appearances impregnable

   the troops destined to carry these important works were
aroused from their sleep at  a m of the d

   very soon after beinir formed the americans commenced
their march moving in column until they reached the base
of the bill where a short halt was made and walker and
hays divided their commands in two parts walker led his
column up the northwest slope of the hill while hays led
his up the southwest side

   the ascent was steep and terribly difficult but the as-
sailants pushed forward bravely until within about one hun-
dred yards of the summit when a loud discharge announced
that they were discovered and as they pushed onward and
upward tbe noise of battle grew louder and louder until
the whole hill seemed to rock and quake with the terrific
peals

   the air seemed to be full of screeching bullets and burst-
ing shells and yet wholly undismayed and with entire
confidence in their leaders they pushed on amid this ter-
rible storm until both divisions reached the fort

   ttcrei followed a short but decisive struggle which ter-
minated in favor of the americans and the mexicans led
towards the bishops palace leaving our gallant feliow in
complete possession of the bill

  elam w baxter bad fought like the hero he was and
just at the moment nf victory he received a musket ball in
the fleshy portion of tbe left arm which occasioned him
much pain in fact both walker and hayes were slightly
wounded

   but it would have taken a more severe wound than bax-
ter had received to bend bis ceurage or stop the flow of hia
patriotic fervor and xun


bravest of the brave

  he was one of the first to enter the fort and while
others hoisted the american flag in place of the mexican
he climbed to the top of a captured gun hat in hand

   boys three cheers with all the wind youve got left for
the star-spangled band-box yankee doodle hail colum-
bit goddess of liberty gineral taylor gineral worth
captains walker and hays president of the great and
glorious united states and everybody else you can think
of hip-hip

  and then there went up a cheer which made american
hearts leap for joy and mexican faces grow pale

  goldarn my great aunts cats kittens but we can
lick hie beeswax right out of this yer town

  another lusty cheer which baxter led by swinging his
cap and getting red in the face

  go and have your wounds dressed said walker
waul capn is there any more fight in ter du asked
baxter leaping down from the gun

  not just yet we must wait for orders

  waal all right but von see this ere puncter jisfc
works my grit up an if theres goin ter be any more slam-
banging i want lie gore to flow

  go and visit the surgeon said walker turning away
  ill du if capn said he and away he went

  as quickly as could be n messenger was sent to general
worth giving an account of what had been done and ask-
ing for further instructions

  cheer upon cheer went up from the army on the saltillo
road when the news of the days vistory reached them and
among the hundreds who envied the victorious companies
and would gladly have been with them none took it so
much to heart as hank dalton

   gineral i cant stand it any longer said he

  stand what lieutenant asked worth in surprise

  i cant stand it to have the boys a-gittin all this
greaser meat an me none i want to jine captain walker
right away

  verv well if you arc well enough you shall do so
how are your wounds

  oh i dont mind em but if ive got to stay here an
let my pards get all this fun an glory itll bust em open
agin said the brave fellow

  very well you -lftill join walker and also be the
bearer of these dispatches to him

   gineral that tickles me like a wedtlin

  go in company with this messenger and go at once
lieutenant

   away i go and away lie did go bearing the dispatches
if general worth

  more enthusiasm could not have lieen raised among the
troops had they been rein forced by a thousand men than
did hank daltons appearance moke when he came into the
fort on independence hill and after congratulations were
over lieutenant roland of the artillery opened with his
howitzers upon the bishops palace with terrible effect

  the balls opened said hank an i want some of the
gravy  du by thunder

  all right hank ill lot von have some said walker
put yourself at the head of the rangers and march upon
the bishops palace

   that yer suits me all ter smash

  you will find good support in captain winton who
marches in advance we must draw the enemy out give
him the bayonet and rush our men in at the gate either
with or ahead of them on their retreat

  all right cap just watch me

   i will

  the stratagem which walker had resolved upon worked
like a charm a heavy mexican force poured out of the
palace and forming in front of the large gate came down
in one dense determined mass upon the american infantry

   but all unmoved the latter received them with a murder-
ous fire and then the texan rangers poured in their rifle
fire which meant a soldier for every discharge

   the mexicans broke and fled and were closely followed 
by the shouting americans who charged them with their
bayonets and entered the gate of the palace in company
with them and in such numbers that utter consternation
seized the mexican commander and the american flag was
floating from the stuff on the tower before he was fully
aware of the disaster which had overtaken him so sudden
was it and without losing scarcely a man the bishops
palace was won

  cock-a-doodle-do cried baxter mounting a large
pyramid of cannon balls that lay in the court-yard and the
answering shout told the listening general that another
point in the great siege of monterey had been won

a cordon of fire

i

  the bishops palace was captured and another strong-
hold gained from the enemy

  the next morning operations were resumed both by gen-
eral taylor and general worth

  captain walker whom worth had pronounced the
bravest of the brave was given a large -hare of the work to
do and placing himself at the head of liis faithful rangers
reinforced by three regiments of volunteers and some of
the work which he led them into was the most brilliant of
the war

  how well t remember that terrible dav

  the street fighting soon became simply appalling and
the veterans and those who had shared other severe bat-
tles stood for a moment utterly dazed by the roar of
cannon the reign of deadly bullets and the slaughter which
marked every square yard of pavement

  rut the americans never flinched or dreamed of any-
thing but victory both columns advanced and soon be-
came closely engaged with the enemy and steadily pushed
forward into the heart of the city

   the rumble of the artillery over the stony streets as it
galloped here and there as emergency required to pour its
answering charges of grape and ball volley after volley of
musketry the shouts of officers the groans of the wounded
all made up a picture that is seldom seen on earth 

  captain walker was doing his part of the work quite as
well as his followers and superiors could wish doors were
forced open walla were battered down entrances made
bravest of the brave 

-  - --- - --

through the longitudinal walls the enemy driven from
room to room from house to house and the sharp erack of
exploding pistols and rifles followed by the shrieks of
women was heard on every hand

   cfteer after cheer arose in proud defiance as dalton or
 baxter from time to time gained a housetop and one of the
 most confusing and terrible pictures was presented that
 ever the war god gloated over

   the column of colonel childs sustained a most deadly
 lijs in the plaza de carne and while forcing their way
 from point to point and amid the storm of destruction the
 during captain gatling of the seventh infantry whose
 name has since been made famous by the invention and
 adoption of the gatling gun was severely wounded in the
 arm while gallantly leading on his company

   both sides of the plaza were now occupied by our troops
 while walker and his men were working their way through
 the buildings and drawing every hour closer to the strong-
 holds of the enemy

   in a short time the enemy was routed and we were in
 possession of the west side of the city and to within one
 lare of the cathedral plaza where the mexican forces
 re concentrated
 j iftight came on and yet the fighting did not entirely
 cease cannon and muskets darted forth their tongues of
 flame and sent their terrible messengers abroad and a wild
 hij-id glare lit up the whole city

   but our men had gained sufficient advantages to rest se-
 cure thousands of them camped in plazas and others
 specially those under walker occupied the housetops and
 -shile some ate and slept others were preparing for the
 morrows fight

   midnight drew  apace ancf for a moment all was
 hushed in darkness peace seemed to hover over the scene
 of j-uin and strife and waving her branch of olive to com-
 mand the contending parties to cease the wild war of blood-
 shed and devastation

   both sides were girding themselves for the terrible
 struggle which was to ensue on th morrow

   and what a morrow that was

   but i will not wean- the reader with the details of that
 terrible siege but will close the chapter with the simple an-
 nouncement of victory for our arms for after three days
 fighting the americans had driven more than double their
 number from all their out-positions and surrounded them
 in such a manner that they must either surrender or evacu-
 ate the city

   general ampudia recognized the situation and wrote a
 letter to general taylor trying to make easy terms but
 the bluff old warrior refused to see it and demanded an
 unconditional surrender which should give us a victory
 worthy of our fighting

chapter xvii

                                            v

fighting to the victorious end

   the ceremony of evacuation commenced on the th
 general worth was intrusted with the superintendence of
 it

  general worth was placed in command of the city with
his division encampcd within the walls while the remain-
der of the array under taylor remained at walnut
springs

  elam w baxter survived the terrible light and was as
full of fun life patriotism and adventure aever in
fact he seemed to have grown a foot in height and a thou-
sand feet in importance	

  he had hurrahed himself hoarse over the evacuation of
monterey and to his mind there was no bird so large so
high-soaring so high-flying as the bald-headed steel-
gaffed american eagle

   he was quartered in the city in worths division and on
account of the bravery and daring he had shown all through
the contest he was allowed greater privileges than many
others and he was continually talcing advantage of them
for his own amusement

   after all these battles after all these great victories had
been won the american army rested a while upon its
laurels monterey was the base of operations and for sev-
eral weeks rest and recuperation was the order of the day
although sonic of the characters with whom the reader
has become acquainted and who can readily be guessed
made the time merry by their antics and adventures

  but at length general taylor received an order from
general scott his superior and rival envious of the fame
he had made demanding a large portion of his army to
assist in the proposed capture of vera cruz

  it was a cruel change for taylor and his men had thus
far been doing good work winning some of the brightest
victories that ever emblazoned american arms and had
jealousy not been at the root of it all taylor would have
finished the war as gloriously as he began it

  captain walker and his men as well as the first mis-
sissippi regiment to which elam w baxter belonged were
among those left to brave bluff old general taylor who
was not more delighted than they were for although scott
proposed to transfer the theater of war to another part of
mexico that bordering on the gulf for the sake of shar-
ing in or appropriating the honors which had been or were
to be won yet there remained for the plucky little army of
taylor some of the hardest work of the war

  general santa anna had been made the supreme dictator
of mexico and was doing his utmost to restore confidence
in the minds of the people and to get together an army
large enough to crush general taylor at a blow

   this wily general had the entire confidence of the mexi-
cans and they not only believed that he would drive out
and crush the invader but they manifested their confidence
by flocking to his standard in large numbers so that by the
time seott had drawn off the larger portion of taylors
army leaving him less than five thousand effective men
santa anna was within a few miles of him with a well
appointed army of twenty thousand

  it would seem in fact it did seem to those who re-
mained with taylor that scott would not have been sorry
if sauta anna had been enabled to swoop down upon the
old hero and capture him

  but general taylor was not made of the right sort of
stuff to be captured any more than his brave little army
wa and when the terrible battle of buena vista loomed up


bravest op the brave

in the distance not a cheek paled not a heart faltered even
chough the greatest hero of mexico was before them with
her finest army

  but to go over the battle of buena vista and give the
particulars would only be to chronicle what has been
written jf the battles taylor met the haughty foe with
his little army in the rocky defiles and gorges of buena
vista and when this demand was made upon him with the
armies face to face he showed himself a hero in his reply
and every soldier under him shouted his approval

  it was a dreadful battle but the americans came out of
it victorious and santa anna the hero of mexico was
obliged to fly from the positions he had chosen lefore a
liandful of heroic men who had never experienced defeat
or dreamed of anything but victory

  the un sank in the west as the last point of the glori-
ous field was won and as night crept on among tbe rocky
gorges the tired american soldiers sank  their arms
upon the field

  although the air was excessively cold the soldiers slept
without fires not knowing but that the mexicans might
return in the morning to renew the contest the hours
were those of horror

  the surgeons were at work with all their might but the
wounded were so many that some were neglected in spite of
all endeavors

  the siege of monterey was one of the most remarkable of
which history gives any account but history fails to record
a braver battle in the face of such odds or a brighter vic-
tory than this of buena vista

  captain walker was breveted major and hank dalton
captain as was elam w baxter who had fought like a
winged demon all through that terrible day

chapter xviii

ringing down the curtajn

  our heroes after participating in the conquest of cali-
fornia under the gallant kearney joined general scott
and under his command took part in the glorious march to
the capital of mexico during which time was fought tbe
battles of vera cruz cerro gordo conteras cherubusco
molino del rey chapultepec san cosme belen gates and
finally with the victorious americans entered into the city
of mexico the former abode of the montezumas and one
of the most beautiful and at the same time one of the
strongest places in the world

  the american army was everywhere triumphant mex-
ico was conquered in less than two years our army had
penetrated into the interior of that ancient land strong in
numbers and natural position and with only a handful of
men compared with mexicans had conquered everything
with which they had come in contact

  captain walker-or major of the united states army
as he should now he called- was returning with the rem-
nants of his texan rangers whom he had led with so much
honor and glory through so many battles and adventures

  he was very sad for at galveston texas he was to part
with them and as yet they had not reached matamoras
near the scene of their first exploits together and besides
this there was a certain mexican beauty bianca gabella

whom he had met and loved in the earlier stages of the war

  what would be his fate in this direction

  the march was taken by easy stages and in many cases
discipline was relaxed so that there was all sorts of fun
and amusement going on while they were making their way
back over the ground they had once conquered

  on their arrival at matamoras the army received a regu-
lar ovation from the inhabitants who now seemed to regard
them as friends rather than enemies but on no person did
the attention of the people fall with more enthusiasm and
respect than upon captain walker the bravest of the
brave

  the whole army remained at matamoras for some time
arrangements having been made to take the soldiers on
board government transports there for new orleans and
points along the coast further north

  and the leading citizens at once assembled and gave cap-
tain walker and his men a reception at one of the large
balls there-a reception and ovation worthy of themselves
and tbe soldiers in whoso honor it was given

  but the event of the evening was brought about when
senor gabella approached captain walker leading his
beautiful daughter and as they flew to each others arms
he said

  you love each other and although she is a scion of one
of the noblest houses of spain who should claim the most
beautiful sooner than the bravest of the brave

  the cheers that rang out from american as well as mex-
ican throats showed how well the speech and the suggjj
tion was received and while the lovers still stood in
others embrace looking fondly into each others eves the
cheers still rang and the music of the band blended every-
thing into harmony

  waal hank what du yu think now asked baxter
while the hurrah was at its height	---l

  maybe as how yer war right bax said hank

  the next day captain walker took leave of his rangers
having obtained a months leave of absence from general
butler-the successor of general scott for the purpose of
marrying the beautiful girl whom he loved so well

  and so iik curtain fell slowly upon this one of the
grandest military dramas of modern times in a months
time the army was removed from mexican soil and accord-
ing to agreement captain walker met his old comrade at
galveston where a perfect whirlwind of enthusiasm was
awakened as was afterwards the case in other portions of
the united states on beholding and having a chanep
honor the bravest of the brave

   then hawkins discarded and filled with two cards

   his hand when hawkins said

   it happened just as red leary predicted in that game of
   cards for reduced as he was to his last dollar the fortune
   of the thief had turned in his favor

   hawkins jaw dropped and his black eyes bulged out

   he was fairly stupefied at his misfortune

  the thief nodded filled a short black pipe with tobacco lit
  it and settled hack in his chair while jim hawkins drew a
  memorandum book from his breast pocket and hastily indited
  a concise note to maud

 when it was finished he carefully read it over and then
 handed it to the hank burglar saying

  hero it is leary it is bound to fetch her

  the thief pocketed the note and arose to his feet
  ill he back in lessn an hour jim said he

  then he left the room and descended the stairs

 hawkins lit a cigar and went into the gambling room ad-
 joining the apartment he had been occupying

  the detective noticed a closet in the so-called office and
  as soon as hawkins was out of eight he slipped out of
  the little hall room and entered the other apartment
ao

all around weekly

  gliding into the closet which was empty he drew the door
  aliut u awaited developments

 the wretch has got maud postboy in his power for some
 reason the detective cogitated and means to blackmail her
 i will remain to see the end of this adventure and lend the
 girl my protctlon should it become necssary then i can
 rab hawkins he is a mighty bad man-much worse than i
 thought he was what secret power does he wield over the
 girl i wonder i hope she will betray it-anyway i will
 noon learn how this affair will terminate

 before the hour was gone tim hawkins returned to the
 room and nervously paced up and down the floor

 	could red leary have fooled me he muttered loud
 enough for tom to hear perhaps he has not gone on the
 errand and dont want to cash the check for me it is time
 he was back

  he had hardly given utterance to these suspicions when he
  heard the sound of footsteps ascending the stairs the door
  opened and the voice of red leary said wheedllngly

  right this way leetle lady right here into this room im
  sorry miss but laws law an i had ter nab him

 jim hawkins sank into n chair assuming a very dejected
 look covered his face with his hand and leaned his elbow-
 on the card table

 an instant later the red-headed bank burglar entered the
 room leading maud by the arm

  there he is miss said he in illy-simulated tones of pro-
  round pity fist looker his mug its that sad a feller could
  amost weep ter look at him

  he pushed her forward rapidly closed the door and ocked
  it taking the key out and putting it in his pocket
  the girl was clad in black from head to foot

 her face was very pale and there was a reproachful look
 upon it as she drew- closer to hawkins and said

  this is a fine piece of business jim 

 ah maud you came eh said hawkins looking up

 yes tour appealing letter touched my heart you said
 you are under arrest for stealing and that the detective will
 release you for a bribe

 exactly so admitted hawkins with a nod

 you said this would be your last offense-that you want to
 save your name from a prison record and swear that if i
 aid you will leave new york

  quite true maud see the point

  rwell it is suspected that you are the murderer of our un-
  cle but i do not and never did believe it in proof of this
  i will do what i can to aid you to become a better man us
  you say you will in this letter

 maud you are my good angel

 i would like to be

 then prove it by paying this man

 how much money does he want

  just one thousand dollars

  the girl started her face flushed and she said

 such a large sum your offense must be enormous

 ho will take no less-see the point

 but this is rank robbery

  cant help it said jim shrugging his shoulders

 but  refuse to pay such a sum

 what refuse dont dare to maud

 why you speak in threatening tones

 well i mean business see the point

  maud started and a suspicious look crept into her eyes

 i distrust you she exclaimed  will leave you

 hold on dont be a clam pony up ive got the upper
 hand

 worse and worse you are becoming wicked
 ilavklns arose with a sinister smile on his evil face

 you refuse said he then ill force you

 what would you dare to injure-

 oh it is only verbal violence i offer you

 what do you signify

 write out a check or i shall let the world know-

 but to the chagrin of tom and the thief both of whom
 were intently and eagerly listening he whispered the rest
 the girl tottered back uttering a groan of horror
 heavens you know that she gasped wildly

 yes now will you sign a check or shall i make my knowl-
 edge public to the world

 in heavens name say nothing walled the frightened girl
 i will give you the money

 chapter xvi

 a shitewll trick

 a look of intense satisfaction swept over jim hawkins
 dark face for he saw that he had the girl completely iu his
 power and could blackmail her all he pleased

 did you bring a check with you he asked

 yes replied the girl in constrained tones

 then fill it out for one thousand dollars payable to bearer
 and hand it to this genileman

 walt said the girl decisively i want proof that he ia
 a detective as he said he was

 cant give any said hawkins with a laugh

 then he is not an officer

 no i will admit the truth-it cant do any harm now that-v
 you know how you are iu my power-see the point i
 the money for myself he will cash the check for

 once

 oh said maud nodding her head you are simply levying
 blackmail i see well i cannot help myself i presume but
 since i have learned that you are simply coercing me i will
 tell you that i will yet get the best of both of you

is that a threat	

 certainly it is a womans wit is equal to any emergency
 and you will soon discover that i am no exception to the
 rule give me pen and ink

 here they are said hawkins taking the requisites down
 from the mantel-piece and setting them on the table in front
 of the girl but you can rest assured of one thing maud
 and that is this we are both very desperate men-see the
 point we will brook no nonsense from you either in tact
 you will not leave this house until you swear by your most
 sacred oath that you will not trick or betray us to the do-
 lice indeed it would be as much as your life is worth to do
 so and besides that if you play us false i would expose
 your fearful secret-see the point	

 as for your threats said the girl snapping her fingers

 i dont care that much for them you would neither kill
 injure nor expose me ill tell you why you are such aii
 avaricious mean spirited and grasping wretch that you would
 only rob yountelf by so doing for it l very evident to ne that
 you mean to blackmail me every chance you get ir i
 hurt or dead you could gain nothing-absolutely nothing
 my money instead now of reverting to you would go to oth
 quarters so you see i realize how the case stands exartw
 ind havo not the least fear of you	y

 as far as i am concerned said hawkins coolly yo
 right but you seem to forget this man he is a paraon t
 would hesitate at nothing do you know who he  v
 well ill tell you he is red leary	 no

 what the bank burglar mentioned in the newspapers

  the same interrupted hawkins with a chuckle how
  does that strike you isnt he a lamb like fellow to get down
  on you for an injury look out maud look out

  the girl shuddered and glanced uneasily at the notorious
  thief

  she was not very favorably impressed with his looks

  biit maud postboy was not a fool

  a shrewd plan to outwit these sharpers had entered her
  mind in the beginning of this game and it was with her hid-
  den idea in view that she so boldly told jim that she would
  get the best of him and his accomplice

  i will write out the check she exclaimed

  hawkins nodded and sat down

  maud opened her reticule and withdrew a blank check
  against the fiftieth national bank of wall street

  then she filled it in as hawkins directed and signed it

  the two villains exchanged significant glances of approval
  and smiled very blandly

  muitd handed the check to hawkins

  you have my best thanks  said the rascal

  it is the first and last check i will sign for you

  do not be too sure-i may come down on you like a load
  of bricks for thirty thousand soon

   gimme ther check said red leary heres ther cash
  i must be goin along now an you kin sen ther gal home
  yerself jim

  hawkins exchanged the check for the thiefs money and
  leary said good-night bowed awkwardly to the girl
  blocked the door and passed out

     ey heard him go down the stairs and then maud turned
     lawkins and uttered a prolonged laugh

  baffled she exclaimed exultantly

 eh what do you mean demanded hawkins in tones
 o alarm what caper have you been up to

  i have fooled you both as i said i would

 how 
 fith that check

  ihe check
  t is worthless

  worthless

  i have no account with the bank it la drawn against
  holy buffering jingo 

  to-morrow i will notify the bank how i was blackmailed
  and stop payment everywhere on it to save myscir from
  uble for making a useless check

  great scott

  isnt a womans wit great eh jim

     he hidden detective could hardly restrain a laugh of glee
  oyer the sharp game the girl had played on the rogues

  what a fool i was not to foresee this groaned hawkins
  oh i knew i could get the best of you laughed maud
  wont red leary be mad when he learns the truth

  very mad i presume but i anticipated some such vile
  uery as this and was thoughtful enough to premeditate
  king you at your underhanded work

  a dark scowl crossed jims face

  	he banged the table with his fist

  you are mighty cunning aint you he sneered

  too shrewd for you

  now suppose red leary goes for me and makes me re-
  deem that check how am i going to pay it

  maud shrugged her shoulders indifferently

  how do i know she replied

  well that is just what will happen

   thought you was going to reform

  that was only a bluff to get your cheek

  then there is no good left in you

  not a particle that i know of

  i thought better of you than this jim

  oh dont gush-dont give me any sentimental business
  maud sighed for she saw that he was beyond reformation
  will you let me go now she asked

  no you must first swear not to betray me

  i swear it in order to make you keep my secret

  and you must give me a good check

 what

  you must have brought a check against a bank in which
  you have got money deposited as you did not know what to
  expect and i want you to fill it out for five thousand dollars
  the girl started and murmured a remonstrance

 no no you cannot force me to-

  but i shall here let me see if you havent got a good
  check stowed away in that reticule

  and he made a snatch and tore it from her hand

  maud uttered a cry of alarm and started toward him but
  he pushed her back with one hand opened the bag and fum-
  bling inside of it he withdrew another check

  rascal panted maud you shall not-

  ah he chuckled interrupting her here it is-see the
  point now fill it in for five thousand ducats

  the girl sat down again in despair

  i wont she said angrily

  then i shall compel you to he hissed

  he drew his revolver from his pocket cocked it and aim-
  ing it at her head he exclaimed

  sign that check or ill blow your brains out

  heaven help me you must be mad

  write i tell you he thundered furiously

  maud picked up the pen tremblingly for she feared that the
  desperate man might make good his threat

  she was just about to write when tom pushed open the
  closet door and jumped into the room with his pistol clutched
  in his hand

  hold on there jim hawkins he exclaimed as he aimed
  his weapon at the young mans head in a very dangerous way
  lower your pistol she shall not write a word on that paper
  if tom wonder has anything to say about it and i think he
  has

the police

  jim hawkins was very much amazed to find himself con-
  fronted by the detective and uttering a cry of affright he
  recoiled from the side of the equally amaaed girl

  maud arose and glancing at tom she cried

  after all my trick has proven to be a success
  hawkins said tom sternly hold up your hands

  the deuce  muttered the chagrined rascal

  do you hear me

  ill alarm the gang in the next room and theyll kill you-
  will you well i think i can prevent that

  do your infernalest i defy you tom wonder

  if you budge an inch ill shoot you

  oh i dont need to run to bring them in

  and neither need i to down the whole gang-see

  as the detective said this he reached up to the electric iir-
  nunclator on the window frame and setting it on tho policc
  call he started it

 stop exclaimed the startled hawkins

 oh no said tom with a laugh ive called police to
 this house now they will raid the place and scoop in all
 the gamblers and aid me to hold you

 well said hawkins it will take time tor them to get
 here and before they do ill have you nailed

 he lowered his pistol and without raising it to aimat the
 detective he pulled the trigger

 a shriek pealed from maud as the report rang out and the
 jingle of glass told that the bullet had missed the detective
 and had gone through the window

 the reverberation of the shot had hardly ceased when tom
 heard the rush of footsteps in the hall

 the gamblers are alarmed  he muttered desperate men
 haunt the den and all of them hate me like poison once
 they get their clutches on me ill have a tussle

 oh mr wonder cried maiul running over to tom
 save me from this wretch great heaven-what peril is
 this we are in oh he will murder us

 be calm i will protect you exclaimed tom

 he clasped an arm around the girls waist and aiming at
 hawkins he fired a shot at him

 oh screamed the rascal and he dropped his pistol

 into that closet with you miss postboy muttered tom

 and he pushed the girl in and shut the door

 hawkins got toms shot in ills arm and was leaning against
 tho wall clutching the injured member with his disengaged
 hand glaring at tho wound like a wild beast his face con-
 torted and his body writhing

 tho footsteps in the hall neared tho door

 then it was lung open

 into the room rushed a score of men

 all hard-looking characters too and but a single glance
 was enough to show-them the situation of affairs

 toni wonder cried one

 a detective rxclaimed another

 he has shot jim llawklns added the third

 tom glanced keenly at them and recognized many old of-
 fenders among the gang of whom he- had made enemies in
 times gone by

 he aimed his pistol at the men menacingly

 get out of here  he exclaimed

 the men scrambled back into the hall and a sullen growl
 of anger broke from their lips

 they thought tom wbs going to shoot at them

 come back hare roared hawkins seeing that they were
 deserting him he is alone and has rung up tho police to
 jail you why dont you take somo sort of satisfaction out
 of his hide

 dont you advance a step said tom

 he frowned and they hesitated

 uu wiring suddenly made a rush for the door

 he aw that ho wbs trapped and that only the most prompt
 action could save him from arrest

 tom fired

 the bullet clipped by hawkins head and missed him

 the next instant he was out in the hall amid his cronies
 tho door was slathraed shut and tom was left alone in the
 room

 ho ran to the door and tried to gel out but found that
 hawkins had taken the key and locked it on the outside to
 keep him in

 it made the detective frantic to find himself made a prisoner
 in this manner

 he hurried over to tho closet and opened it

 -mies maud como out he exclaimed

 have the villains gone breathlessly asked the girl

 yes and they have locked us in here

 oh my what shall we do

 ill burst the door open-see

 he held his revolver at the lock and pulled the trigger the

 bolt was broken and he opened the door

 just as the detective and the girl hurried out in the hall a
 fearful commotion was heard down-stairs and tom knew then
 that the police had arrived in answer to his summons and
 had encountered the gamblers in the act of escaping

 the expressions uttered by the frightened gamblrs soonap-
 prised the police of what the trouble was and they charged
 on the rascals when a struggle ensued

 the fight was at its height when tom left the girl in the
 hall and ran down-stairs

 go for them they are gamblers cried the detective as
 he ran into the midst of the throng in the dark hall do not
 spare them boys 	i

 he ignited ills dark-tantern flashed its rays on the strug-
 gling shouting crowd and gave lhe three policemen an op-
 portunity of distinguishing friends aud foes

 most of the gamblers tried to gel away without fighting

 at the moment tom joined in the fray the three officers
 were each struggling with a man apiece and the detective at-
 tacking another the scene of confusion increased

 it did not last long however for all but those who had
 been captured having made their escape the officers reudered
 their prisoners docile with their nippers

 tom scanned all of the men

 hawkins was not among them

 the detective was disgusted and giving the man he cap
 lured into the hands of one of the policemen he ran up-btairs
 to get maud	i

 she was gone

 a thrill of dismay passed through the officer

 what has become of her he muttered

 filled with anxiety he hurried into each of the rooms ran
 down stairs searched the floor below and in fact searched
 the building through

 it was useless

maud had vanished	 --

 the policemen went away with their prisoners

 maud must have come down stairs during the excitement
 the detective muttered and has gone out in the street

 to see he hurried out

 down sixth avenue ho saw her ramiliar form

 she was walking slowly along occasionally looking back
 and tom accelerated his pace to catch up to her

 there was a cab going along dose to the gutter ahead of
 the detective and he did not notice that jim hawkins sat
 inside of it

 maud had not seem tom yet

 the cab reached the girl ahead of tom came to a pause
 the door oponfed hawkins sprang out rushed up to her pressed
 a small sponge saturated with chloroform to her nostrils lift-
 ed her up in his arms and got into the vehicle with her
 again

 tom was amazed and came to a sudden pause

 the whole thing was done in a twinkling

 by the time the detective recovered his wits the cab had
 started oil at a rapid pace

 tom ran up sixth avenue after it

 an abduction he muttered but what for

 he had recognized hawkins at a glance
 only one impression prevailed in the defectives mind and
 that was the fact that hawkins wanted to get the girl in his
 power so that he could force her to sign a check for him
