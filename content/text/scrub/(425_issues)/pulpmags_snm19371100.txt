and he hadnt known it until this minute
hadnt realized it until cap davidson had
spoken of the perils of an over-confident woman
flier now jimmy could visualize francine in
reflection more clearly than he had ever seen her
in person he could see the golden flecks in her
blue eyes the bright slash of her crimson mouth

 and the high quivering peaks of her gracious bosom
 he could almost feel her in his arms young and
 soft and tender clinging to him her form pressed
 close to his those pulsing globes pressed flat against
 his chest he thought with a quick hot swirl of
 his blood good gosh im in love with that dame
 id pass out if anything happened to her

 immy brock had liked teaching frandne
 diggs to fly she was a natural indeed the
 only woman he had ever known who had a
 rose for the air and a steady hand for the controls
 i ie had never given her a personal thought how-
 ever despite the fact her hair was as sunny as golden
 fleece about her pretty face and her blue eyes always
 sparkled with crystalline fires vaguely he realized
 she had a figure a very beautiful figure with large
 jutting breasts a trim waist and long tapering legs

   he stood now listening to cap davidson the
 chief instructor soloing francine said the cap
 is digging her grave for her shes too damned
 good too damned sure of herself

 the moment she gets her ticket
 therell be no holding her down
 until they haul her out of a crack-up
 with that shapely torso of hers all
 smashed to pieces

   jimmy oddly felt his blood run
 suddenly icy in his veins he felt
 his knees trembling beneath him and
 a dull sick feeling hit the pit of his
 stomach his hand shook a little as
 lie tied his green
 -carf on the tail-
 light of a train-
 ing plane signi-
 fy i n g that he
 who flies i s t o
 watch out for
 the fledgling on
 its first solo he
 couldnt under-
 st a n d himself

 now nor his queer pulsating reactions what he
 asked himself quickly did francine diggs mean to
 him not one damned thing came the prompt
 answer but it was a lying answer

   for all at once jimmy knew he was in love with
 francine that some of the enthusiasm he had felt
 in teaching her to fly was purely because he had
 liked being close to her had liked those heavily
 fringed blue eyes shining into his and those warm
 soft globes rising and falling rapidly on her small
 frame as she listened to his instructions he had
 jiked too the subtle fragrance of gardenia that
 wafted up his nostrils from her hair every time
 she sat close to him

a full length snapp y novelette
complete in this issue

  by patsy hunt

whos the dame
whos getting you
down like this
j imm y she
wanted to know

 no matter how good a woman pilot is
the cap went on gravely there comes a time
when in a tough spot something goes haywire
with her-something snaps in her head-and its
curtains i guess its just because theyre women

                                                        first and pilots second
                                                        y e a h said jimmy
                                                        huskily i guess youre
                                                        right cap

                                                   remember that rosie
vance said the cap lean
hear her yowling now for me
to take over the controls and she a crack
pilot and bessie wister leading the
derby and then zowie bessie probably
got to thinking of last nights necking party
and therefore couldnt put her plane down
without cracking up there was rosamond
dorington up in yonkers going haywire
landing the ballanca shed landed a hundred
times before overshoots the field by five hundred
feet and smashes up in the trees and theres this
diggs dame  headed for six feet deep and a lily
on her bosom the cap ran fingers through his
shaggy black hair no matter how good a woman
pilot is he concluded shes never quite good
enough tell miss diggs to keep that tail up
coming in and to cut out the climbing turns


snappy

  and then just as francine tripped out of her
long yellow roadster and came lightly across the
field her golden head high her sweetly feminine
rondures swaying gracefully with her agile step
the cap went on his way mumbling boy and
what a pretty corpse that dames gonna make

francines blue eyes were sparkling she
looked up into jimmys lean bronzed face and
screwcd her lashes into a tangle well heres
your fledgling she announced gaily its just
a matter of hours now before ill come through
my limited commercial with colors flying and be
straight in line for that transport license arent
you proud of me professor

  jimmy swallowed hard his dark eyes moved
slowly over francine and he wondered deep in
his pounding heart how he could have spent so
many hours recently with maizie delacorte the
little red headed waitress in the airport cafe next
to the flying school hangars when all along he
had loved this student with such a sweet hungry
absorbing emotion he wondered a little dumb-
founded how he could have held maizie so close
to him of an evening when his heart was somewhere
else

  just didnt recognize what was what until now
he excused himself for he was idealistically senti-
mental about love it was all right for a man to
sow oats plenty of them-and plenty wild but
when love came it was something to honor and be
true to perhaps that was a silly belief-silly and
old-fashioned but it was his code nevertheless

  and he knew now with his dark gaze fastened
on the voluptuous pout of francines breasts that
if she felt about him as he did about her that he
would never hold maizie in his embrace againj
would never feel the white tendrils of her arms
drawing him closer and closer to her warm young
body

  he said quickly before his nerve deserted him
francine  will you marry me will you quit
flying and and marry me

  francines blue eyes dilated for a moment she
looked utterly shocked then suddenly she smiled
and her slim scarlet-tipped fingers floated softly
over his lean cheeks jimmy she said on a
whisper do you really mean it you know youve
never made a pass at me i  sort of thought my
love was hopeless you see ive been teched in
the haid about you from the beginning but there
was your indifference  and therewas maizie 

maizie didnt mean a thing to me jimmy
almost shouted and then more softly francie
will you marry me  and give up flying
francine came closer she said softly this
was the last thing in the world i expected after

weeks and weeks after months and then  this
oh jimmy

  jimmy with his heart pounding slipped an arm
around her trim waist hurried her to the other
side of the plane beyond the view of anyone in
the shadow of a wing he crushed her to him and
kissed her parted lips and ran his fingers rather
clumsily through her golden hair he could feel
francine twitching violently could feel that delec-
table bosom of hers rising and falling against his
chest and her breath quick and uneven on his
mouth jimmy became intolerably dizzy and reck-
less he went on kissing francine hungrily almost
desperately as if this kiss might be the last she
would ever give him his hands found the ball
of a zipper and there was a bee-like buzz on the
crisp morning air

  francine gasped a little said oh-h jimmy
as his arms crept around her hers tightened about
his neck and jimmy moaned with the sudden
ecstasy of this thing with the aching wish that
shot through his veins for one brief second he
opened his eyes and looked up at the clouds instead
of down upon them

  and clouds wont talk he thought smugly
and pressed francine in his hungry embrace even
more tightly

  oh-h jimmy-jimmygasped francine into
his mouth

  he said something soft and almost inarticulate
in answer and went on kissing and caressing her

along while later francine ran a comb
through her golden hair turned the seams
straight on her stockings and pulled up the shining
ball of the zipper with a bz-z-z-z- she took out a
powder puff and tapped it to her impertinent little
nose and licked her finger-tips with her small red
tongue and ran them across the golden arches of
her brows then she lit a cigarette and stood smok-
ing rather thoughtfully

  fwhy she asked at last do you wish me to
give up flying jimmy

  jimmy told her all the reasons everything the
cap had said and his own observations thrown in

  w hat poppy-cock snorted francine id
never explode in a tight spot im more at home in
a plane than i am on my two feet and you know
it jimmy jimmy flying is in my blood dont
ask me to quit please dont ask me to give it up
look said jimmy evenly with all the
hazards i know about planes and flying id go
crazy with you up in the air it-it would be a hell
i couldnt endure i never loved a girl before
francine i didnt even know i loved you until
the cap painted a grim picture of what might
happen to you when you got your ticket today and
snappy



just thinking about it made me go cold and watery
inside it would be like that all the time he
caught his breath he stared straight into her wide
attentive eyes i tell you francine i-i couldnt
take it

  francine licked her red lips thoughtfully her
two slim hands went up under her bosom that
was a nervous gesture of francines one she in-
dulged in when thinking seriously it made
jimmys heart flop over on its two
hands and stand there swaying
inside of him i could promise
you i wouldnt fly said francine
steadily but i know i wouldnt
keep it so why start off falsely

if you dont want a flying wife

jimmy id be willing  id agree
to any terms

  jimmy shook his handsome dark
head he went on looking into her
blue eyes that wouldnt work
he said grimly i mean not for
long it never does theres too much freedom
and too much independence on each side id like
to marry you francine id like to feel you were
mine always and as your husband id want to
protect you i couldnt if you were up in the air
careening about

  and you wouldnt marry me unless i give up
flying even though youve said im as good a
flyer as you asked francine and theres no
compromise

  thats whats the matter said jimmy

francine bit her lower lip the long fingers
dug down into her lush breasts and the soft flesh
oozed out between them she said jimmy if i
can take this plane up now on my first solo after
whats happened here  when im hardly myself
at all  wouldnt you trust me afterwards not to
go haywire in a jam

  how do i know that would prove anything
said jimmy icily how do i know how much my
love has disturbed you maybe my kisses didnt
mean as much to you as they did to me maybe
you were just stringing me along maybe farris
merril is the guy you really love you two are
always together

  francines small back went rigid maybe she
snapped very furious maizie is the girl you love
maybe i was just an easy mark for you you and
maizie have been doing a siamese-twin act around
here for a month 

  jimmy turned away without another word
color burned lividly in his lean cheeks and his
mouth was grim he pulled the chocks himself
and strode across the field to a hangar he didnt

watch francine fly or see her come in for a perfect
landing he did hear farris merril one of the
schools crack stunt-fliers yell out in a booming
voice

  oh boy look at that girl of mine look at
her slipping that ship over the hangars coming in
sidewise like a dizzy bat avaition was invented
just so francine could strut her stuff on the clouds 
the cap said jimmy ought to be proud of his
student shes the best he ever
turned out and then say-y
farris did i understand you to say
francine was your dame
yeah said farris

   is that just your idea or hers
too probed the cap

   ours said farris

jimmy listening could feel a
queer constricting ache under
his heart so that was it so that
explained everything and yet
francine had let him take her in his arms had let
his fingers slide over her warm flesh and had re-
turned his ardor with a convulsively eager respons-
iveness he hadnt known many women oh a
few ships that pass in the night like maizie a few
very cheap dolls who put a trifling price on their
kisses he had known a girl or two who had
thought themselves in love with him but despite
his inexperience he should have been able to have
typed francine he felt

  but what sort of a girl was francine engaged
to farris  and out necking with another man in
the shadow of a planes wing jimmy swallowed
hard shes just a tramp he thought an
ordinary tramp a hot little number letting off
steam and i could have sworn francine would
be on the up-and-up with any man i could have
sworn that when she let a man kiss her like i did
today she meant it-with everything in her my
asking her to give up flying was a very convenient
loop-hole for her saving embarrassment ail the
way round and what a sucker i was to add my
scalp to her philandering young belt

  jimmy turned and took one look at farris
merril he was a tall lean blond young man un-
consciously good looking with an arrogant swagger
he was a crack aviator fearless and uncaring he
had ferried lockheeds down to lima and taken
fords over the hump he was the kind of man
who could mow down females with that white
flash of a smile and those twinkling blue eyes-
any dame was his for the asking

  jimmy was sure francine would find her match
in her choice farris would probably be a past-
master of two-timing for every bit of neck


snappy

francine catches on the side farris will be going
the whole hog somewhere thought jimmy and
turned and left the hangar

  maizie was behind the giant griddle of the air-
port cafe pouring batter  the shining metal
surface and scooping up hot-cakes when jimmy
strolled in she saw him instantly and her green
eyes began to burn and her bright red head nodded
a warm greeting

  she said as he came up to her hi jimmy
  hi kid

  gee its good to see you fellow said maizie
and she knocked a hot-cake up in the air and caught
it on the downward spin with an accuracy that was
practically perfection see she giggled thats
how my heart acts up when you put in an appear-
ance and i dont mean maybe jimmy

jimmy grinned at her he liked maizie prac-
tically every man in the town liked her and
tried to date her just yesterday he had been flat-
tered because she showed a distinct preference for
himself now it didnt seem to matter nothing
did nothing ever would he was afraid

  and if you ever gave me the air laughed
maizie this is what would happen to my heart
and she flipped a cake up in the air deliberately
missed catching it and stood smiling as it squashed
all over the griddle

  no said jimmy thats not true youd be
on the telephone about five seconds later asking
some guy to come up and have a drink with you 
maizie grinned it was true she said dont
rub it in kid a gal cant help it if she doesnt go
deep and then still flipping cakes and catching
them she added softly look here jimmy ive
got about five more minutes of this and ill be off
duty want to wait here-or ease around to the
apartment

  jimmy said hed wait and he did he stood
leaning against the door very tall and dark and
sober he watched maizie with a sort of fascina-
tion she was a pretty little thing in that green
silk uniform with the fluff of white organdy on
her hair and the infinitesimal apron at her waist
swelling breasts bulged over the apron strings in
enormous twin juts and the smooth green material
flowed downward over soft curves like water as
she swung the hot cakes jiggling them on the
turner her bosom jiggled in rhythmic accompani-
ment it was a lovely picture to watch-maizie at
that griddle and jimmy forgot that less than an
hour ago he had told himself hed never be with
maizie again

  he remembered however when he sat on
maizies low red silk sofa with an amber cocktail
glass twirling in his lean fingers and maizie coming

out of the bedroom to him her green eyes glowing
and her voluptuous figure shadowily revealed be-
neath the t r a i  i n g white chiffon negligee he
gulped his drink and put the empty glass on the
end table he said gosh maizie you look like
a million bucks i mean that

maizie sank by his side soft and young-and
eager her arms went with experience around
his broad shoulders one long bare leg pressed
against him

  j i m m y she whispered between her white
flashing teeth kiss me give me everything
youve got fellow

  jimmy swept maizie to him with a groan he
crushed his mouth down on her parted lips his
fingers fled over the soft bareness that was her body
beneath the negligee he was a little dazed when
his heart kept its regular beat when his blood did
not shoot out along his big body with a burning
conflagration what was the matter with him
this was maizie wasnt it beautiful sensuous
little maizie who was made to love maizie usual-
ly went to his head like champagne surely he
hadnt seen enough of her to tire of her surely
not yet and still a certain lethargy was in him a
heaviness of arms and legs and head

  with maizies red head floating before his eyes
and maizies parted panting lips under his he
thought of all things at such a moment of fran-
cine his heart did leap then warmth came into
his fingers and a wild trembling to his long legs
maizie whispered into his clinging mouth atta
boy jimmy i was beginning to think this wasnt
your night to howl 

  but as quickly as the swift throb of blood en-
tered his body maizies voice stilled the riot he
went on kissing maizie however went on making
a pretense at love his mouth slid from hers down
her throat across the bare sculptured beauty of
her shoulders and her arms even maizies wild
response the trembling of her under his caresses
did not rouse him and maizie was nobodys fool
presently she pushed back in his arms she looked
jimmy straight in the eyes

  she said another dame jimmy who is she
whos getting you down like this

  jimmy said hoarsely dont talk like an oaf
im just tired

  no mans ever too tired with me snapped
maizie rather irritably who is she jimmy

jimmy got up he poured a drink gulped it
poured another one gulped that too he
poured one for maizie and handed it to her she
took it and jimmy saw that her hand was trembling
this was a dirty trick he had played on her he
snappy



shouldnt have made a date with her but how
was he to know that being with maizie wouldnt
be the same now not after he had loved frandne
as he had

  maizies eyes were very green and very shrewd
beneath the black curly lashes going to get
blotto so it wont make any difference
who youre with jimmy  she asked and
her toe in the fluffy feathered mule
tapped impatiently on the floor

  jimmy didnt
say anything he
just poured an-
other drink and
drank it slowly

 no youre
not said maizie

not with me any-
how she bit her
lower lip and to
think i had a
chance for a real date to-
night with farris merril

he c a  e d me about five
minutes before you came
into the cafe

  jimmy jumped at that

well it was what francine
deserved she and farris
were a pair of two-timing
tramps

  he thought if maizie
were the deep serious type

farris would probably hurt
her in the end as francine
has hurt me but maizie
wasnt like him maizie
could give and take and de-
mand nothing maizie
wasnt the type to feel any-
thing for long

  im sorry maizie said jimmy evenly i
am tired

  then said maizie suppose you trot along
home to bed

  not a bad idea maizie

mind thought jimmy would jump at a girl like
maizie last night i would have but tonight
im not in my right mind

  boy said maizie almost as if reading his
thoughts youre in love and how youd better
do something about it i always knew youd be one

he said quickly
will you quit hy-
ing francine   
and marry me

a nd jimmy got his cap and twirled it in his
fingers for a moment as he stood looking at
maizie he couldnt understand himself there
she sat on the sofa half reclining deliciously
sprawling her whole posture was inviting the
white chiffon foamed translucently over her body
the high peaks of her bosom pushed hard against
the thin gauze there were no stockings on the long
bare legs and they were honey-brown startlingly
dark  against the white any man in his right

 of those true loyal gallant souls once it really got
 you  and then maizie sat up on the sofa

 i bet she went on softly its that frandne
 diggs youve been teaching to fly

 just the mention of that name made jimmys
 heart pound his fingers clutched on the cap until
 his knuckles showed white his tongue came out
 and licked the sudden dry surface of his mouth
 maizie sank back on the sofa

 i thought so she said well luck kid


snappy

youll need it casanova merril
has already tossed his hat into that

ring oh-h dont look so amazed	-

jimmy i had a date with farris	y

all right but im only a canape to	

him francine is his real banquet	yj

  in the weeks that followed
francine got her commercial
limited and transport license she
was flying all the time even the cap said hed
never seen such a flying fool as francine why
that girl said the cap can fly anything from a
pursuit plane to a giant amphibian upside down
right side up or inside out  it was true francine
handled a plane with a sort of careless rapture she
was a humming bird impudent dazzling crazy
mad with the power of flight given to incredible
speed incredible darts and swoops and hoverings

  and she seemed to handle farris merril with
equal skill the cap told jimmy one day

  why francine has almost turned that chaser
into a fireside dozer he hasnt even had a date
with maizie in a month he doesnt sit over at
the cafe either making passes at each dame who
trots in the cap grinned i wouldnt be sur-
prised he finished to see farris taking up knit-
ting one of these days maybe when he and fran-
cine are married hell stay home and do the chores
and francine will earn the bread and bacon

to which jimmy snapped maybe but i doubt
it a leopard doesnt change its spots not really
say-y said the cap whats eatin you i
wonder if you had an eye cocked on francine your-
self

  that tramp that little bum jimmy ground
out ill say i didnt

  the cap rubbed his chin thoughtfully so you
did huh and no happy landings for you too
bad jimmy better luck next time

  the first time jimmy saw francine after that
day by the plane he nodded to her coolly remotely
she looked almost as shocked as she had when he
had asked her to marry him she promptly opened
her red lips as if to say something and then closed
them she went on her way rather quietly her
blue eyes thoughtful and her hands dug down in
the deep pockets of her flying coat jimmy watched
her out of sight there he told himself thats
that she knows now she didnt get away with
anything after all

and then one day weeks later francine fer-
reted him out at the flying school she said
jimmy ive wondered why you asked me to
marry you and then never spoke to me again i
mean even if i wouldnt give up flying we could
be friends yknow

 	friends jimmy said trying

                 to grin is a girl like you ever a
                 friend to anyone

                  i dont understand francine
h f	said her golden brows arching

 	he could have explained he

f i i	could have told her he didnt un-

              derstand her either he could
have said that it was pretty low of
her letting him fondle and kiss her that day behind
the plane when all along she was engaged to farris
merril he said instead because he was so fierce-
ly proud

   you didnt really think i meant that proposal
did you francine

  her answer was a long time in coming

  no-o she said finally some men propose
just to make the path easy for them i knew all
along you werent putting a thing over on me
jimmy she smiled then im a gal who has
to have her moments she concluded gaily and
now that we both understand each other so per-
fectly cant we be friends she held out her hand

  oh sure why not said jimmy casually he
took her proffered hand and then his eyes
bulged for that brief contact of her flesh with
his made his heart pound and his knees tremble
he dropped her fingers as if they had been hot

  and he went straight to maizie by the gods
he told himself furiously ill get that little
tramp out of my system ill burn her out

  but while maizie was a delicious flame while
maizie was love and forgetfulness jimmy came
to with maizies head on his shoulder and the old
ache for francine just as piercing as ever in his
heart

   youre still alive said maizie but youre
only working on two cylinders who in the devil
is she jimmy francine come on tell me im
your pal

t ecause jimmy was so miserable he told
maizie all about francine maizie said at
the end and even now even if farris didnt
mean anything to her  even if francine werent
the tramp you say she is  would you marry her
if she insisted on flying

  no-o said jimmy but why speculate
francines a tramp and shes going to marry farris
and thats that if i married francine id be afraid
that every time i went out the front door the army
navy and marines would be coming in the back
boy said maizie go home and take a dose
of sulphur and molasses i dont know when i
ever saw such a case of spring sickness or is it
jealousy jealousy of farris youre positively
green around the gills do you know it
snappy

ii

  jimmy said thanks for being so sympathetic
maizie youre a good kid and he left

  he didnt leave right away he stood in the
foyer downstairs smoking a cigarette and looking
at the headlines of the evening paper on the news-
stand the little blonde behind the counter was
conscious of him and he knew it she rolled her
blue eyes and arched her full bosom upward and
found ever so many reasons to walk up and down
her quick light steps doing exciting things to her
well padded body she said finally ill be off
duty at midnight i live upstairs interested
jimmy went on smoking and looking at the
head-lines no he said evenly he could feel
the girls resentment flaring out behind the counter
he could hear the quick intake of her breath and
then he heard her say oh-h hello farris
jimmy swung around farris in a white mess
coat and meticulously pressed black trousers was
streaking through the foyer a gay look on his lean
face his blue eyes shining farris said hi
daisy and then seeing jimmy leaning against
the counter hey there jim hows tricks
okay said jimmy indifferently and then
where you goin or isnt it any of my business
its none of your business grinned farris
but my life is an open book im going to see a
beautiful dame she just telephoned shes lone-
some

  and whatll francine have to say about that
what francine dont know wont hurt her
laughed farris

  your life is an open book all right said daisy
from behind the counter but its a wonder to me
that the censors dont get to work on you

  farris laughed and stepped into the self-operat-
ing elevator he grinned at them bowed low and
slammed the gilded door shut jimmy watched
the cage rise he watched the little arrow above
the door one two three four five the arrow
stopped maizie farris was going to see maizie
and what was francine doing he didnt have
to wonder long for as he stepped out into the
street a long yellow roadster swung past a slim
dark man was on the front seat next to francine
his arm was around her shoul-
ders his handsome head was close
to her golden one

  jimmy jabbed his hands down
in his pockets what a cock-
eyed world he grumbled im
the only sentimental fool left in
it the only one who believes in
real love any more

  all the next week jimmy tried
to interest himself in one of his
former students she was a lovely

little brunette diminutive curvy big-breasted
with t n t in her black eyes her name was
marjorie gates but at the school she had been
immediately nicknamed plunk because she fell
with spectacular regularity into the bay you
should never have solod that dame the cap
fumed shes going to kill her fool self shes
no francine diggs by a long shot

plunk was an exciting diversion for jimmy-
but nothing more they danced they dined
they chatted endlessly about aviation they drove
far into the woods of an evening under the stars
with plunk close in his arms jimmy caught for-
getfulness time and again but not for long
francine golden and lovely always came back in
his memory to taunt him and tease him and torture
him

  i wish thought jimmy caressing plunks bare
arm that francine would hurry up and marry
farris maybe id get over her then maybe id
quit thinking about her imagine me falling for
a dame like francine with not a single ideal in her
dome

  it was a lovely star-studded night plunk was
in jimmys arms her dark head was on his shoul-
der and her arms were closely curling about him
jimmy could feel her full red lips moving over
his neck her eye-lashes tickling him as they flut-
tered excitedly he didnt want to think of anyone
but plunk he wanted to think only of her warm
fragrant bosom and her lovely legs and the warm
respond of her kisses plunk wasnt like maizie
and she was much lovelier

  but even as he held her close and kissed her he
thought only of francine plunk seemed to sense
this she said do you love all your gals by remote
control jimmy i can feel you i can see you but
somehow i have a feeling you arent here at all

  that was the last date jimmy had with any girl
francine had spoiled them all for him utterly

  there isnt he had to admit at last any
such thing as forgetfulness for me and all because
of a little tramp

  for days jimmy thought of pursuing francine
with intentions certainly not
honorable she might as well
two-time farris with me as any-
one he thought but it would
be dangtiuus business he knew
he knew what sort of girl she
was he knew he loved her
despite everything and it would
be playing with dynamite to
start something that couldnt be
finished he could bear up under
her marriage to farris now but
if he spent long hours with francine if he caressed
her and kissed her and received the whole sweet-
ness of her response her marriage would kill him
he decided to avoid her as usual

it was on a saturday morning when jimmy was
cutting across the airport field headed for the

school hangar when he saw francine waving to him
beckoning his heart leapt instantly his knees
began to tremble he pretended he didnt see her
he went doggedly on

  then francine began to call jimmy yoo-hoo
jimmy he still didnt turn j-i-m-m-y
yo-o-o-o jimmy

  he yelled back what it is trouble
do you he heard her ask love all
your gals by remote control jimmy

he stood looking at her in the distance a
small lovely girl she was with the crisp
breeze lifting her golden curls and modeling her
blue silk dress to her voluptuously beautiful body
even at that distance he could see the tops of her
high stockings where the wind had lifted her skirt
he could see honey-brown thighs and the white
edging of pink panties he could see also the
way the wind made the blue silk cling to her jutting
bosom accentuating their high solid peaks i
wouldnt dare go over there he cautioned him-
self i wouldnt be responsible for what i did
and as he approached her entirely against his
will everything in him fighting his advancing
steps he wondered briefly if he could take francine
in his arms and not faint with the sheer ecstasy of
the contact

  francine smiled when jimmy went up to her
she said evenly  just wanted to say good-bye
jimmy im not in any trouble or anything
good-bye repeated jimmy questioningly
and then his heart turned over painfully he real-
ized all at once how much it had meant to him just
looking at francine though he never spoke to her
youre not-not going away for good he asked
with a little break in his voice

  oh - said francine of course not im
just going on a trip i picked up a job today ive
got to fly across the border into mexico im carry-
ing twenty gallons of gasoline to morris chalmers
who ran out of fuel down in the mountains they
got his radio sos today  and i got the job
thrilling isnt it

  gasoline cried jimmy good gosh fran-




snappy

cine youre not going to try to land gasoline down
in the mountains are you

   no said francine im not going to try im
going to do it she smiled at jimmy then her
blue eyes very wide and im wearing a chute
its rough country and i wouldnt be foolish enough
to take a chance on a forced landing i do have
brains jimmy even though you dont think so
look here said jimmy almost desperately
youve never made a landing in rough country
you dont know how treacherous it is one false
move and youll be blown to bits with all that gas
on board look francine i cant let you do this
ill do your job for you and you take on miss
harris my student today youd go haywire on
that assignment just knowing you had gasoline
on deck would be enough to unbalance you or any
woman 

   what sort of a flier do you think i am jimmy
said francine stiffly the crystalline fires in her
eyes the round chin firm and stubborn

  a woman flier snapped jimmy his chin just
as stubborn

  you havent any confidence in me have you
jimmy

  no  snapped jimmy not you or any woman
look at plunk

  you look at her said francine icily or
have you looked yourself cross-eyed already
im going with you if you insist upon making
that fools trip said jimmy sternly

  fine said francine and then she smiled
itll be like old times flying together wont it
jimmy

  jimmy said yeah but he was thinking
gasoline on board and me a sizzling fuse this
trip will make history

t immy sat tensely in the plane for about ten
seconds and then the old joy of flying beside
francine got into his blood and flamed along his
veins he forgot all about farris and that francine
was engaged to him he forgot that francine was
a two-timing little tramp he grinned happily as
he watched her blue eyes scan the instruments and
he reached out and touched her arm in silent ap-
praisal as they came out of a dense fog on the
course without losing or gaining a foot of altitude
but that touch was the spark that the fuse of his
emotion did not need

  afterwards jimmy sat there with his heart
pumping crazily and his eyes blurring it took
every bit of his control to keep his hands off her
his love was a sort of crazed madness a dizzy
rapture her clear-cut profile danced against his
retina the long cool shapeliness of her legs beat
against his consciousness those magnificent breasts

of hers were so impudently outward thrust so
completely alluring

  he was so preoccupied with the ocular sport of
just taking francine in that he missed completely
what she was saying

  he came to with a sick start however when
francines words  -and so we decided to have
the wedding at the little mexican center next
monday isnt that exciting caps going to be
best man of course farris wouldnt think of
having anyone else  penetrated his conscious-
ness francine went on talking gaily but to jimmy
her words meant nothing a chattering jumble
he heard only the high lilt of her sweet voice he
couldnt in his tortured mind put together two
words she was saying he could only think
farris and francine at last no hope now no
hope at all jimmy was so sunk in gloom he
couldnt speak

  francine said do you care jimmy i was
hoping you wouldnt her eyes were on him
round and blue she said with a quick intake of
breath as if it hurt her oh jimmy you do care
dont you im so sorry maybe i can help you
to forget

  how asked jimmy glumly and he was
thinking there she goes figuring on two-timing
farris after theyre married shes nothing but a
little tramp i ought to be glad i was spared being
tied up with her but he wasnt glad he wanted
her he was willing to agree to any terms as low
as they were

  how repeated francine laughingly dar-
ling must you ask

   jimmy said squinting his eyes and looking down
on the earth that was a long golden space beneath
them-the desert he said let us make a land-
ing there easy

crancines chin went out her long lashes
 fluttered but in the next moment jimmy felt
the ship swooping down felt it nosing toward the
ground he cried out for petes sake francine
dont go haywire weve gas on board enough
to blow us to hell and back again

   then why worry said i-rancine lightly i
mean if we can be blown back again

  she made a perfect landing she turned and
faced jimmy she was smiling a little

  well she said so what it was carelessly
said almost indifferently but jimmy saw that her
lower lip was quivering the pupils of her blue
eyes were big and black and burning the rise of
her breasts was accentuated by her quick uneven
breathing

   jimmy didnt flatter francine with the usual soft
soap he didnt tell her she was beautiful that
snappy

he loved her that he wanted to marry her he just
reached out and caught her to him one arm around
her slender waist he tried to be very casual about
it all no use to let her see how mad he was
about her

  his lips ran over the golden riot of her hair



him pressing her soft curves into his chest and
her red mouth circling his

  with a hoarse groan jimmy returned that
rapture the feeling within him was so tense so
throbbingly potent it was almost as if he had never
held a woman against him before fragments of

he could feel her blood pump-
ing wildly as he kissed her

across her smooth white brow under her temples
he could feel her blood wildly pumping he kissed
her throat a pulse was throbbing there too very
slowly with maddening deliberation he un-
buttoned the leather knobs on her red jersey
and trailed soft kisses on her snowy shoulders
for a long moment he rained kisses all over
her face his hands swept up and down her
arms

francine was breathing hard jimmy for
petes sake she cried and flung her arms about

thought came to torture him that wedding at the
little mexican center next monday francine in
farris arms like this he fought down the
thoughts and gave himself utterly to the moment
a memory jimmy told himself in his last thinking
moment was better than nothing the loaf the
whole loaf would be farris from monday on
but now these delicious crumbs were his and he
was feasting on them

back up in the air francine was remote and un-
talkative jimmy sat there silently looking down


snappy

upon the bank of clouds he felt only numbness
after awhile he supposed pain would come pain
at the thought that francine would never be with
him like that again pain-because memories could
never be as satisfying as reality indeed jimmy
was so sunk in gloom that he was unconscious that
the motor suddenly conked lost revs and rough-
ened he didnt even know francine had jerked
erect that she was white and frightened looking
that she cut the gun to smooth the motor at the

same time banking and turning the plane back
toward las vegas

  exhaust valve said francine and jimmy came
to with a start number seven cylinder stuck
wide open

  francine opened and closed the throttle the
motor responded roughly the plane vibrating like
a giant shimmy dancer francine didnt seem so
scared now she said quite lightly if this plane
had a pair of fans it would wow an audience look
at it dance

  but even though her demeanor was gay jimmy
saw that francines face was still white and that
her bosom was rising and falling rapidly he
thought in a second now shell go haywire ill
have to take over only a man could handle this
anyway aloud he said

  youd better jump for it francine ill try
pancaking to the river too many towns down
there if we cracked wed kill ourselves and about
a hundred others with us

  jump yourself said francine stubbornly
this is my job and my plane ill handle it
but the rivers a good idea ill try for it

  bail out yelled jimmy bail out you little
fool and give me the controls

  jimmy said francine coolly whos going
haywire now you look like death takes a holi-
day

  francine have you forgotten you have
twenty gallon sj gas on board jimmy
caught his breath he yelled out i can land

this plane you never can now bail out
did you bring your skates francine asked
calmly because you should have yknow if
anyone bails out itll be you she paused a sec-
ond it was nice meeting you jimmy thought
id tell you last chance and all that sort of rot 
and she laughed

she did not give up the controls and jimmy
did not bail out francine kicked the ballanca
straight and leveled off she looked at jimmy out
of the tails of her eyes grinning mischievously
jimmy groaned shed never make it theyd be
blown to hell he had a wild thrilling thought
that hed rather be blown to hell with francine
than see her married on monday to farris he
grinned then some of the whiteness left his own
cheeks he said touching her arm i love you
francine i never have loved anyone but you
and i meant it that day when i asked you to
marry me

   i knew it said francine evenly i guess i
knew it all along even though you almost con-
vinced me that i was nothing but an easy mark for
you she would have said more but jimmy
stopped her words with a kiss it was a long hot
burning kiss he felt in his heart it would be the
last shed never make that landing there was
comfort in knowing he would be kissing francine
when the end came

  but the end didnt come as jimmy pulled his
lips away he saw the ground knew that the
wheels and tail skid had touched grass simultane-
ously she hadnt tried pancaking to the river at
all shed tried and accomplished the unaccom-
plishable the plane rolled clean to the stretch
of dry earth he thought good grief she
made it with a dead propeller-and with me kissing
her all the time

  francine sank back on the seat her blue eyes
dancing and her bosom quivering out before her
under the red jersey

  well she laughed so what now jimmy
  jimmy swallowed hard

  all right francine he said i take back
everything i ever said about you youve got
what it takes grit stamina and if youll excuse
the word -guts no man ever had any more
youre as safe in the air as you are on the street
perhaps safer the excitement and approval
went out of jimmys voice then he said soberly
farris is a lucky guy

  most bridegrooms are said francine but
why bring him up now and then smiling
jimmy if you asked me again to marry you would
you ask me also to give up flying

ortrait

roy voasrit an art collector but
he spotted a real treasure-just
in time

  ty barton had always been on his guard
i against any form of sentimental weakness

      his only love until now had been his work
he had been wrapped up body and soul in the
mad thrilling business that was wall street and
therefore he had had no time for love had not
even thought about love despite his marriage six
years ago to monda

  but looking back on his life now roy suddenly
felt the lack of love in his crowded days and
love he told himself couldnt mean monda

  it was odd he thought that he didnt love
monda and it was a pity because monda de-

served love she deserved a mans arms about her
slim waist a mans lips loving and caressing her
own a man that was hers and hers alone he
thought of her only as a gracious decoration for
his home and table he became in a few words
used to her

  and now he wanted love breathless thrilling
throbbing love he wanted a girls lips gasping
with emotion under his he wanted warm arms
around his shoulders a soft body swaying inward
to meet his and the exciting pressure of hard breasts
pressing into his chest it didnt occur to him that
monda might want the same thing too-that she


of

might be hungry inside thirsty for a big draught
of love it didnt occur to him that they had both
failed each other miserably he thought only of
himself that he wanted a real feminine woman
that he was going to have one

  roy got up from the desk then and walked out
into his offices he was looking for one girl he
was thinking of a cozy apartment with dim lights
and a white satin sofa he was seeing vaguely a
girl in a shimmering negligee with the lines of her
body gleaming through the soft translucent folds
he was thinking of red lips with a satin softness
of a high peaked bosom against which to cradle
his head after a weary day at the office he was
thinking of all the things he should have consid-
ered when he married monda-and which he didnt
think of then at all

  roy had a scowl on his face he looked older
than thirty-five because of the tenseness of his work
and he was lean and tall and strikingly blond he
knew that women admired him he had felt it
in their eyes for the last six years

and then roy stopped thinking his eyes fell
on kathleen burke who was the most beautiful
creature he had ever seen in his whole life kath-
leen was merely a single figure in a pool full of
stenographers but she stood out she dominated
the offices she was that comparative rarity a really
exquisite red haired woman

  as he stood there he did not analyze her in
detail he saw the firm hills jutting out under the
slick black silk of her dress he saw the split skirt
that went up above her knees and showed the round-
ness of them and a band of creamy flesh beyond
the stocking top he saw her lean over her type-
writer and what that pose did to her satiny ron-
dures how the black satin gaped and a dark valley
sprang into view he saw all these things but only
as a total effect that was good and exciting and
beautiful

  he turned back into his office shut the door
sat behind the desk and sent for kathleen burke
his heart was pounding as he waited for her his
knees fet weak under his desk and his hands were
fidgeting nervously

                when she came through the door
and stood there mondas kindness
and her generosity beat against him
for a moment this was his first
unfaithful moment to monda and
habit is a strong thing

  but when kathleen burke came
across the room swinging her silky
hips and her full graceful breasts
moving up and down with her step
roy forgot monda he forgot
everything but the hunger in his
heart and the vital thing his mans life had missed

  he smiled up at the girl who had taken a chair
at his side he said when you were designed
the gods must have been in an inspired mood miss
burke

  and his eyes went over her then more closely
in detail now he saw the high pointed peaks of
her firm bosom pressing against the black silk he
saw the tinge of rose color under the creamy band
of flesh above her stocking he saw the red tip
of her tongue just beyond the barrier of her teeth
-and his heart began to pump his temples throb-
bed and his breath went short in his chest kathleen
burke was a beauty a rare gorgeous exciting
beauty

  she said thank you mr barton and her
eyes met his squarely his heart leapt again she
knew why he had sent for her she knew that roy
barton never required the services of the girls from
the pool when he had a dynamic efficieit secretary
of his own who allotted the work to them all

but despite his pumping heart there was some-
thing in the girls eyes he didnt like a dollar
mark look perhaps a look of mink coats and
jewelled baubles and a sleek town car well he
could afford those things now other men did
and his gaze moved down from her eyes to the
body of the girl what he saw was intoxicating and
because he was trembling violently and because this
business was so new to him he began to dictate

   out of the tail of his eye he saw her fingers busy
with the zipper at her bodice he heard a little
b-z-z-z-z but he did not look up he wouldnt
spoil things by rushing her even though he knew
now instinctively that the girl had had her green
eyes on him for a long while he went on dictat-
ing he paid no attention to the light touch of
her knee against his he pretended not to see the
swollen white mounds of her bosom when she bent
across his desk to get letterheads and check the ad-
dresses on the correspondence he sat rigid wait-
ing for time for nerve - for her to make the
advance

   he didnt wait long after that in the middle of
a letter the girl spoke her voice was very soft




snappy

throbbingly young and vital she said mr
barton why did you want to dictate to me today
ive been here a year-and this is the first time
ive been called into your office why

he kept the emotion out of his voice dont
you know and he laid a light hand on her
knee half expecting her to move that dimpled
softness away but she didnt she only sat look-
ing at him through that dark fringe the eyes more
green and glittering than ever the red mouth
slightly open

  yes she said finally i know and im-
glad

  he said will you have dinner with me to-
night it was a spontaneous invitation he knew
that monda was expecting him home for dinner
tonight he knew that monda was giving an
enormous dinner and one of the distinguished
guests would be eric borgstrom the famous por-
trait painter he knew that monda had never met
eric borgstrom and was a little nervous

  roy she had begged please come home to-
night and help keep the conversation going

  what do i know about art he had said to
which monda had smiled you can carry on a
conversation about anything roy really youre
rather remarkable dear - and ill need you to-
night

  kathleen burke said id love to go to dinner
with you-roy and at this girl calling him by
his given name roys heart leapt and his veins
flamed he got up quickly caught the girl by
her hands and drew her to her small sandaled feet
he felt clumsy and dizzy and because he was so
unsteady on his own feet he pressed her against
the big mahogany desk for support for one
moment he felt like a consummate fool he didnt
love this girl-and wasnt it love he had been want-
ing then why the hell was he here with her
like this

  in a moment though whether he loved her or
not did not matter his head went closer to hers
slowly deliberately he went a little weak as the
warmth of her body surged through the black silk
to his encircling arm in a sort of daze with a
strange reckless feeling burning in his veins he
pulled her close heard her sigh ecstatically felt
the hard-and yet soft-peaks of her snowy ron-
dures pressing hard against his body

  she said as her parted lips went up to his kiss
me dont tease me-kiss me

xittth a hoarse cry roy seized her wildly

  he found her lips her burning poppy-
colored passionate lips it was a long breathless
kiss it left him shaken trembling he couldnt

have stopped kissing her then even if he had
wanted to and he didnt he swooped her up into
his arms and carried her into his private study to
which no one was ever admitted with his heel
he clicked the door shut behind them

  darling - darling murmured the girl her
mouth like red butterflies against his bronzed neck

  as he went towards the sofa he buried his face
in the red flame of her curls his hands trembled
over the pliant firmness of her skin as he lowered
her to the dark green couch his heart contracted
and then beat wildly he kissed her bared flesh
gathered her close to him crooning words of a little
apartment of dim lights of shadowy beauty as a
setting for their future the girl said nothing only
clung to his lips nodding her head vigorously
then he couldnt murmur anything he was one
throbbing hulk of deep emotion-hungry with it
-desperate

n oy didnt get home that night until after
eleven he came through the door of his
spacious drawing room feeling guilty and some-
how a little shamed there were many guests
about the room and passing among them with her
gracious southern hospitality was rose wall
mondas destitute cousin from the south her
likeness to kathleen burke was so startling so
vivid that roy found himself gulping it might
have been kathleen there in his drawing room

  it took a full minute to bring into his conscious-
ness kathleen as he had left her kathleen in the
blood colored negligee with her flaming hair about
her bare shoulders her green eyes a little less
bright as if drugged it had been a pleasant inter-
lude a thrilling one but it had been only an
interlude just how long it would last he didnt
know now and looking at rose wall he thought
quickly shes lovelier than kathleen to win
rose would be a conquest kathleen was too easy
his heart leapt

  monda he saw now was sitting at the grand
piano by the sweeping breadth of the gold draped
windows and leaning down toward her was a tall
blond man he must be roy thought the painter
eric borgstrom and he was looking down upon
mondas fingers as they flitted over the piano keys
in a way that held him transfixed for a moment
it had been a long time since he had seen a man
look at monda like that

  it didnt disturb him he went over to the piano
and monda smiled her bright smile and caught his
hand gently she didnt mention the fact he had
not showed up for dinner indeed roy had a
queer feeling now that monda hadnt even missed
him monda said softly roy this is count eric
borgstrom our guest for the week-end count
borgstrom my husband

and as the two men shook
hands monda went on playing
softly

  it was a strange week-end
for roy he didnt like count
borgstrom why did he trail around after monda
in that silly ogling fashion men had admired
monda before there was nothing new about that
but to be so obvious about it to act as if he roy
had no place and no part in mondas life it was
sickening it was offensive he resented it not
on account of monda heavens no but because
of his masculinity

  he was glad to get back to the office on monday
-and to kathleen he settled himself at his desk
and prepared to ring for the little redhead when

in a sort of daze
he heard her sigh
ecstatically

       his secretary came in and announced count
eric borgstrom roy ranted wasnt the
intrusion upon his home life enough why
must he pursue him to his job of work
he quit ranting when the tall dane came in he
listened with almost unbelieving ears when he said
mr barton i wish to do a portrait of your ex-
quisite wife

  roy stared at him too surprised to answer
monda-the great man wanted to paint monda
the idea aroused so many conflicting considerations
that his reply when it came was a stammer why
id be honored im sure it was an honor any
man in new york would boast that his wife was
beautiful enough to rate a portrait by borgstrom




snappy

he notoriously painted only rare beauties and he
charged outrageously its the money thought
roy suddenly mondas pretty but not that
pretty

  but it wasnt the money it seemed that the
count wanted the portrait for himself roy
couldnt understand it why he asked what
on earth do you want with a p o r t r a i t of old

monda

  eric smiled indulgently because she is the
most paintable woman ive ever seen her lines
are incomparable her face is exquisite she is
in a word ravishing but didnt you know or
have you been with her so long so close youve
failed to even see her that happens with hus-
bands and wives you know he smiled a little
wider at least he added with some husbands
busy american husbands

  roy was stunned secretly he thought monda
was looking very tired these days a little peaked
about the mouth certainly anything but ravishing
he thought that if eric could see kathleens color-
ful beauty he would have laid his artistic eyes upon
something that was really paintable

  and at that moment kathleen entered with a
possessiveness that made roy quake a little inside
she came swinging her silky hips her red head
high and her voluptuous breasts bouncing right and
left with their unbrassiered freedom she winked
a green eye at roy laid yesterdays unfinished
correspondence on his desk and turned when she
faced eric she smiled up into his eyes arched her
bosom a little as if calling attention to its pouting
glory-and left

  roy thought hes seen her thatll end
mondas portrait aloud he said there is a real
beauty if youre looking for beauty to which
eric only shook his head the world is full of
that kind and then added do i have your per-
mission to begin mrs bartons portrait it is the
continental custom to approach the husband before
i ask the wifes permission

  its okay by me said roy indifferently but
he didnt feel indifferent he felt the first pride
in possessorship of monda hed felt in six years
monda will be flattered silly he said go to it
and luck

  when borgstrom left roy did not ring for
kathleen he sat at his desk for a long while
trying to bring the vision of his wife before his eyes

  and then out of nowhere something struck
roy he felt a little chill run over his body was
there anything going on between monda and eric
was the portrait just a blind

  he remembered the way eric had been looking
at monda at the piano and mondas indifference
to whether he had come home at eleven or not at

all he felt exceedingly uncomfortable and he
knew all at once he didnt want to lose monda he
didnt love her of course he had married her
for her money it wasnt exactly the loss of
monda that was angering him-and he didnt
know just why he was feeling so hot under the
collar and so icy down tne spine

  kathleen came in then without knocking she
was beginning to assert her privileges her power
over him

  she said hello darling glad to see me
  he wasnt but he said yes certainly

  and when she caught his hand and led him into
the study when she closed the door behind them
and curled her soft arms about his neck roy was
sorry that he had started anything at all with this
girl yesterday it had seemed the only thing to
do wasnt he hungry for love-for a womans
kisses wasnt he still hungry

  he looked down into kathleens slim face and
thought of erics words-the world is full of
that kind and suddenly roy knew it was true
knew that he didnt want kathleen or anyone like
her knew with a queer sick feeling inside that
he had loved monda almost from the very begin-
ning and that he loved her now with an acuteness
that made him a little dizzy

  kiss me darling-kiss me purred kathleen

automatically roys mouth dropped

to the red splash of lips he clung to them
his hands went over her soft white flesh slipped
through the vent of an armhole swept over the
warm surface of a slim back he felt the girl
tremble against him felt her drawing him to the
sofa but even as he followed and sat with her
on the low green couch and took her into his arms
he was not thinking of kathleen burke he was
thinking of monda

   slowly as these thoughts revolved in his mind
he began to feel that he who had had everything
from monda had given her little or nothing in
return when she had probably expected the
emotion he had given to this little redhead yester-
day he had let her down he knew all at once
how sublimely generous and how unselfish she
was and more startling than everything how
much he loved her

  kathleen burke pushed back in his arms what
the hell she spat out are you trying to make
love to me by remote control your body is here
-but wheres your brain

  roy looked at the girl the white silk of her
blouse was off her shoulders the jutting fullness
of her bosom strained against the silk the outline
of high peaks showing plainly she was twisted
on the sofa too in a way that made the split of her
snappy



skirt open to her white thighs and reveal the edging
of tailored pink satin panties it was a lovely sight
but now strangely it did not appeal at all to roy

  whats eatin you any way f asked kathleen
burke her green eyes glittering trying to put
over a fast one maybe

  no said roy im just not in the humor
that happens you know

  not with me snapped kathleen not more
than once and she jumped up flounced toward
the door her
breasts rigidly
angry before her

dont think
youre going t o
get away with
this roy bar-
ton s li e said
turning dont
think for one
minute   

  a mink coat
would look sweet
on you kathy
said roy glumly

and w hen she
did not answer
he went on

wouldnt you
like a trip to
europe stay a
year or so

alone of course

   the girl smiled
vividly she said

boy youre
talking turkey

when

  and roy said

now

 and kathy
smiled again and
left as smug as a
cat who had got
into a pitcher of
cream but roy wasnt smiling he sat down on
the couch twisting about restlessly was monda
with eric now and if so what was happening
he was to ask himself that question for a whole
month for monda was never at home when he got
there these days it seemed that she posed for
eric in the mornings in the afternoons in the
evenings she came in after these journeys to the
danes studio with her dark eyes burning slum-
brously with her dark head high and her luscious
ripe mature bosom displaying its beauty vividly
he would look at her with his heart pumping

and his brain whirling he would ask himself
over and over how he could have held that superla-
tive gorgeousness against his own body and re-
mained passively emotional why had he per-
mitted business to dim his senses the most im-
portant part of a mans being

he waited for monda on that monday
night until eleven and then he said damn
it to hell ill go around to the danes studio and

see for myself what is going on just where i
stand in this triangle

  but as he reached the wide marble hall monda
came through the door she was wearing royal
purple velvet with a small ermine cape across her
lovely bare shoulders her supple twin beauties-
for all their ripe maturity-rode out rigidly on her
frame the clinging material showed the incom-
parable line of her hips and the tapering perfection
of her legs he gasped monda said in her lilting
voice well the portrait is done its lovely roy
and the study eric is giving me is marvelous


snappy

calling him eric now asked roy glumly
and then people dont sit for their portraits at
night monda i know that you do so what
he saw a faint surprise in her dark eyes of
course not roy we talked

  roy went inwardly sick they talked he
knew how much talking they had done and then
monda tossed a bombshell that exploded all
around roy shattering his happiness leaving him
weak monda said dont you think it queer
roy eric said he never intends to get married
never

  who cares said roy icily

  and monda said why i do terribly

  roy swallowed hard he experienced a quick
desolation an utter dropping out of the bottom
of the world as he looked at the loveliness that was
mondas as if for the first time and wondering
too if it would also be the last more than any-
thing in the world he wanted to take her in his
arms he wanted those red lips under his those
graceful soft rondures pressing against his
chest

  what a fool ive been what a blind fool
he thought how could i have anything to do
with that redhead when i had this why didnt
i come home that night instead of going with
kathy if i had this would never have hap-
pened but in his misery he could say nothing
he just stood there sunk

  then monda said well he wont marry so i
suppose ill have to look elsewhere for a husband
for rose rose ought to marry some one roy
shes too young to be on the loose frankly i
worry about her marriage is the only thing for
rose  if eric was only a marrying man   
rose gasped roy did you say rose

          
 heres hoping

         when theres a breeze
         i see your knees

        when northwinds rise
        i see your thighs

        when storms do blow
        up - up i go

if some day we get an earthquake maybe
ill see the rest of your torso baby

   i was so glad when eric asked to paint me
monda went on softly i thought now i can
put over rose i can talk her up i saw it as a
fine opportunity but it was no use at all abso-
lutely no use and she clicked her little red
tongue against her teeth shook her dark head

suddenly roy caught her slim shoulders
was it because he wanted you

   monda said yes wasnt that silly me of
all people

  silly roared roy silly what man
wouldnt

  you never have said monda evenly her
magnificent bosom rose and fell rapidly among
other things roy saw for the first time what an
intensely emotional woman his wife was he went
weak clean to his toes

  monda was it because of-me-that-that
you-didnt marry eric

  yes said monda i happen to love you
i always have though goodness knows why
monda cried roy and he swept her to
him it was as if those beauteous globes were
touching his body for the first time as if the whole
loveliness of her was in his arms for the first time
he was strong with the joy of it weak with the
strength of it monda pushed back a little against
his brutal embrace roy she asked incredu-
lously do you love me really

  love you cried roy he swung her up
masterfully into his arms started up the winding
stairs with her love you he repeated on a
wild primitive note of possession im going to
prove to you just how much  love you-and want
you monda from this day on

rudif miller sat before
the mirror listening for the
sound of those dreaded foot-
steps that she would event-
ually hear them was a fore-
gone conclusion when
screwey shelton set out to
get a gal trudie had dis-
covered he allowed nothing to
stand in his way it was pointedly obvious that
trudie was the next on screweys list and there-
fore mr shelton could be expected at any mo-
ment

  let it be understood here and now that trudie
had no particular objections about being gotten
she was as broadminded as she was hipped and she
liked her fun as well as the next one the only
catch to trudies flow of reasoning was that she
liked to pick the man and the wheel of fortune
as spun by trudie had not stopped in the
general direction of the purveyor of swing that
was swing known to his fans as screwey
shelton

  trudie was dressed for her evening before the
microphone and she was more undressed than
dressed being very dark she was dressed in white
satin a clinging slinky evening gown which was
totally devoid of back sleeves and almost every-
thing above the waistline two narrow strips of
material accentuated the round firmness of her
breasts enticingly displaying the valley and in no
way interfering with the most fascinating motion
whenever trude moved about

  her arms and shoulders were quite bare being
protected against any vagrant drafts by a generous
coating of sweet scented powder trudie liked the
dress and she liked the way it displayed her charms
but there were moments particularly those spent
trying to dissuade screwey when she would have
liked a little something more substantial

screweys footsteps heavy and forceful
sounded in the passageway outside trudie
sighed and prepared to meet his entrance

  hi screwey said conversationally as he
entered the dressing room

  hi trudie replied screwey shut the door
and turned the key in the lock thats not neces-
sary trudie told him

  you can never tell screwey said he walked
over to her and grinned down into her face he
was a good looking chap big beefy and he looked
as if he might be able to provide an interesting
evening trudie did not know why she did not
vibrate towards him

  screwey lowered himself to the edge of the
make-up shelf

  how about a little kiss  he suggested

  id rather not big boy trudie said

  screwey reached down and his powerful arms
closed about her lifting her as though she
weighed nothing at all screwey deposited her on
his knee he eyed her half-exposed bosom
frankly and his eyes glittered

  ya know screwey said there are hun-
dreds of girls in new york just as good looking
as you are and with just as good voices

  so trudie fastened her big black eyes on
him

  why not play ball with screwey his grip
had tightened about her waist and his eyes were
burning

  why make a play for me trudie wanted to
know i told you im not interested and im
not thats all there is to it screwey i like you
and thats that

screwey started to say something then
changed his mind and his tactics he com-
menced to run a large hand along the bare flesh
of trudies soft arms his other hand dropped
to the vicinity of her waist and trudie could feel
the warmth of it through the clinging material

  dont that do something to you screwey
asked and his tone suggested that she was doing
plenty to him

  trudie shook her head you leave me cold
she said which was not the truth


  screwey de-
cided to depend
on actions

trudie felt his
hands on the
bare smooth skin
of her back and
on her soft
upper arms she
could feel t h e
swell of her
bosom and her
heart hammer-
i  g and she
could feel the
thumping of
screweys even
through the stiff
dress shirt

  trudie stood
it for a short
time then
fought herself
free she
dropped to the
floor her eyes
were bright and
her breasts rose
and fell with
gnger beneath
the voluminous
skirt her thighs
were trembling
with fright

screwey came to
her again and
before she real-
ized what he was
going to do he
had slipped
down the
shoulder straps
o f h e r gown

screwey she
gasped

 she swal-
lowed hard and
swayed towards
him and as his
fingers caressed
her she realized his labored breathing annoyed her
almost as much as his fingers

  dont tell me i dont do something to you
trudie could scarcely hear him she wrenched
herself away and hastily replaced the shoulder-
straps

  get out screwey trudie whispered

  screwey

  licked his lips
  swallowed and
  squared his
  shoulders then
  he pronounced
  his dictum
  you can think
  what you like of
  me he said
  but unless you
  meet m e after
  we get through
  here tonight  
  youre fired
  trudie smiled
  bitterly just a
  louse at heart
  she said

   if you think
  that-okay it
  isnt that at all
  you and i could
  have a perfectly
  swell time if
  you only would
  im treating you
  this way to bring
  you to your
  senses

   trudie walked
 over to the mir-
 ror and sat
 down she was
 shaking all over
 you have less
 chance than ever

  o	f having t h e
  time youre
  after she said
  coldly

  screwey
 started for the
 door he un-
 locked it and
 swung it open
 we shall see
 what we shall
 see he said
 confidently

 uh-huh but it wont turn out the way you
figure

 screwey went out and trudie embarked upon
the job of repairing her damaged make-up she
hated screwey and yet   

 the evening broadcast was over and trudie was
having a drink with the announcer bill farmer




snappy

bill had had screwey shelton and his bunch ever
since trudie had joined them she had seen him
dozens of times and now she was seeing him for
the first time she supposed it was because he
had instantly detected that something was the mat-
ter and had been sympathetic

v ou dont have to tell me whats the matter
bill said i know you see ive known
screwey a long long time

  trudie sipped her drink he has a rep eh
bill ground out his cigarette he boasts of his
record which is that hes stepped out with every
girl whos ever sung with his band

  oh trudie said and she was glad that she
had put a dent in the screwey record

  has he issued the ultimatum yet bill said
it quite calmly trudies eye met his and she
nodded why dont you get out

  im afrad ill have to trudie said but
what im going to do for money i dont know
ive got a big family to take care of

  bill leaned across the table with an effort he
managed to transfer his gaze from trudies half
revealed bosom to her anxious eyes softly bill
said

  until tonight trudie you havent known i
was on earth ive known you were here for some
time in fact ever since the first time i saw you
i didnt know i wish i had known trudies
voice was low and she felt little chills running up
and down her spine there was something about
bill something she had not noticed before her
breasts commenced to throb a little and she shifted
her feet nervously under the table

  look bill continued i can get you a job
at the studio sustaining it only pays forty dollars
a week but it wouldnt be long before i could get
you a sponsored programme

  im making a hundred with screwey trudie
said and it takes all of that to live i dont see
how i could do it bill

  it wouldnt be for long bill pressed her
and it would certainly be better than staying on
on screweys terms wouldnt it

  trudie smiled and her little hand closed over
his she leaned forward and her magnificent
bosom was something to admire in that position
she enjoyed bills expression of excited interest

  right now she said softly i wouldnt stay
on with screwey for anything

  darling then its all set you get through
here after tonight

the minute trudie entered his apartment
bill knew something was wrong she said
nothing as she took off her small hat and her gloves

and laid them aside she was dressed in a tailored
suit which brought out the width of her hips and the
strength of her long straight thighs she moved
over towards the couch and her breasts swayed this
way and that beneath the inadequate covering of
her satin blouse she sat down crossed her legs
and accepted the cigarette

  im going back with screweys band bill
trudie announced

  bill sat down beside her you cant do that
he said you know what it means

  i do know what it means and i cant help it
look bill ive been working for forty dollars a
week for six weeks and nothings come up along
the sponsored line ive spent most of the money
ive saved and ive reached the end of my rope
youve seen screwey

  trudie nodded i ran into the so-and-so on
broadway this morning he asked me to come
back and i said i would

  did he tie a string around the offer

  the usual string trudie admitted she
sighed wearily it doesnt seem to matter any
more

  she fought back the tears and suddenly found
herself in bills arms he held her close and she
clung to him if anyone had told trudie that she
could have felt in the mood for love she would
have laughed in his face yet before bills arms
had been about her thirty seconds her bosom
commenced to throb and she pressed herself against
the willing bill

  oh darling she whispered no matter
what mood im in the minute you touch me i go
limp

t ill did not answer his eyes were alight and
his mouth dry he gently disengaged trudie
and pushed her against the back of the couch then
he slipped her arms out of the coat and tossed it
aside the firelight glinted on her dark hair and
bill could see the steady rise and fall of her
bodice

  he kissed her trudie slipped her bare arms
about his neck and her long pointed fingernails
commenced to trace a scorching course along the
back of his neck

  darling trudie whispered this may be the
last time we shall be together

  promise me you wont go out with screwey
until you see me later this evening

  i cant trudie said

  promise bill repeated

  i cant trudies voice was weak and he
thought he could hear the hammering of her heart
his arms went about her waist

  promise bill said for the third time
snappy



  i wish i could trudies voice was choked
but i cant

  bill moved his hands his fingers trailed
across smooth warm skin and trudie began to
tremble

  promise bills voice was thick he bent
forward and the space between their lips was tissue-
paper thin he was breathing hard and trudie
too seemed to find it difficult to catch her breath
she flung herself
against him her
mouth seeking
his

  darling she
said hoarsely

ill promise any-
thing you like

only kiss me   
kiss me    and
dont stop  

p asp ar
conners

looked up wearily
from his desk

again he de-
manded

  bill grinned
and helped him-
self to a seat i
am he said and
youll be sur-
prised to know
what im here
for ive come to
sell you on the
idea of spon-
soring trudie
miller

  caspar came as
near to explodin
as his low bloo
pressure and lack

o	f imagination
would allow him

youre wasting
your time he said

actually he was not more than fifty

  bill took a deep breath and went into battle
listen mr conners he said you want
vivian viveash for your program or you wont have
anybody right caspar nodded you cant
get vivian because shes signed up by the luck
baking company

  i can wait casper said theres no
hurry

   shes on option for the next three years to the
baking company bill said patiently he pulled
out a photograph of trudie and tossed it under
caspers long beak nose whats the matter
with her

   that was caspars cue she hasnt got what

i	want he said i want a girl with the face of
an angel the voice of an angel and the soul of an
angel vivian viveash has all those things

caspar looked off
into space it
was plain to see
he had an aes-
thetic feeling
about vivian

  do you know
vivian bill
asked

  ive never
met her caspar
said but ive
seen her i see
her every night

i	know where she
dines and i dine
there too she
dines alone and i
think shes love-
liest when shes
eating aspara-
gus

  bill thought
the guy was nuts
but business i s
business

   you like her
because she eats
alone he asked

                                   i like her be-
   cause shes good
   caspar said she
   neither drinks nor
   smokes and ive
   never seen her
   with a man
   which proved
   that he didnt
   know the viveash very well an idea was buzzing
   round inside bills brain

   he got to his feet all right he said ill
see you again and the next time i see you youll
sign trudie miller on the dotted line

   not while there is vivian viveash caspar said

trom his vantage point at the end of the bar
bill watched vivian she behaved disgrace-
fully the man she was with looked like holly-

a bust up

pulsing paul aw baby where is your heart
pulsing pauline straight down my neck first turn to
the left

 he looked about seventy
darling she whispered this may
be the last time we shall be together

woods idea of a bookmaker he was coarse and
he was rough and at least once during dinner
pinched vivians cheek vivian seemed to like it

  she drank and she smoked and her ribald sallies
could be heard all over the small obscure little
eating place bill was delighted he paid for
his drink went out and then came in again this
time he entered the restaurant proper and seemed
to be looking around for a table he spotted cas-
par and made for him

  hello bill said brightly didnt expect to
see you here

  caspar waved him limply to a seat i have
never been so disillusioned in my life he said
see that harridan over there with that dreadful
thug he indicated the hilarious vivian and her
cheek-pinching boy friend

  sure bill said who are they

  caspar shook his scraggy head dolefully i
dont know the thing in trousers he said but
the girl is vivian viveash

  bill studied her critcally well he summed
up ill say this for her    shes good all right
caspar shuddered have you that contract
with you he asked

  bill grinned what did i tell you

  as soon as he had signed it caspar lurched
to his feet and tottered out his world a sham-
bles about his feet bill walked over to the viveash
table

thanks a million viv he said you too
ted say you seemed to be having fun all right 
ill never be able to come into this joint again
vivian said i thought the old guy was going
to die on the spot

  bill prepared to go anyway    thanks a
million

  there isnt much more to this little saga of
broadway broadcasting bill got to the nightclub
just in time and he and the newly signed contract
spiked an evening for screwey and saved trudies
reputation

or the better part of an hour
mr biff belcher known to
the alleged sport of wrestling
as the tilton terror had been
sitting hunched over a rickety
table in the boarding house
boudoir he shared with his side
kick and partner in pachy-
dermy mr ham hunkel the
georgia killer it was an unusual position for
the tilton terror the stub of a pencil was
tight-gripped between his thick fingers at least
a dozen sheets of assorted hotel stationery some
covered with figures and some with curious hiero-
glyphics were sprawled out on the table before
him the tilton terrors tongue lolled out of
one corner of his mouth and he chewed on it with
bovine satisfaction

  suddenly he sat up swung the chair around
and faced the huge double bed upon which the
georgia killer was stretched his misshapen face
buried in the pink pages of the police gazette

  all right mr belcher said i got it down
here in black and white

  mr ham hunkel lowered the paper yeah
he countered eloquently

  yeah mr belcher echoed we got one
thousand eighty bucks in the bank outta that you
get five hundred

  mr hunkels bushy brows knit and what do
you get

  the tilton terror consulted the paper in his

 

  hand five hundred and eighty hesitantly

  the georgia killer sat up on the bed swung
his bowed legs over the side how come he
bellowed how come you get five hundred and
eighty and i only get five hundred

mr belcher indicated the paper its all
down here in black and white there was
a slightly tremulous note in his voice indicative of
his feelings for six years now he and the
georgia killer had taken the good with the bad
the knocks with the boosts but wrestling wasnt
what it used to be and hard times had brought
harsh words between them they were parting
company and the paper in mr biff belchers hand
indicated the final split-up of their gross capital

  it kin be pink and yellow for all  care mr
hunkel exploded what  wanna know is how
come you get more than me

  mr belcher sighed you forget them or-
chards you sent to that blonde cootch dancer last
week them orchards cost eighty bucks

  what orchards mr hunkel demanded

  them purple flowers mr belcher supple-
mented you sent a dozen and they cost eighty
bucks

  mr hunkel went a little green around the gills
being reminded of the incident involving the
blonde cootch dancer and his gift of a dozen orchids
wasnt the pleasantest thing to think about

  we had eleven hundred and sixty bucks in the
bank until you spent eighty mr belcher ex-
plained thats how come you only get
five hundred and i get five hundred and
eighty

mr hunkel rubbed his hand over his head
he was thinking hard and thinking always

sure you want it this way ham he asked plain-
tively youre sure we aint makin a mis-
take

  the georgia killer shifted on the bed i aint
makin no mistake from now on im on my
own

  mr belcher sighed rose from his chair im

  goin down for a morning paper he said can

i	get you anything ham

  mr hunkel grunted a refusal behind the bar-
rier of the police gazette the tilton terror got
his hat started for the door but before he reached

it a gentle
knock sounded
m r  hunkel
peered over the
top of his
shaded periodi-
cal again the
knock sounded

  o pen the
door you
dummy the
georgia killer
blurted

  biff belcher
reached for the
knob turned it
swung the door
open his
watery blue eyes
almost popped
from his head
when he saw the
two young girls
facing him one
was a blonde
and the other a
brunette - but
both were gor-
geous the
brunette was
wearing a skirt
and sweater
both tight
enough to re-
veal the arched
curve of her
hips and the
plump pout of her firm melon-shaped breasts
the blonde had a printed silk dress on-and that
was all the tilton terror decided he went
goggle-eyed looking at the points of her small
cone-shaped bosom pushing out the bodice of her
frock

would you be interested in buying a lottery
ticket the brunette queried in a low throaty voice
that made the tilton terror wriggle inside she
smiled up at him with her carmine lips parted the
lower one so full and heavy that it drooped
moistly

  who is it mr hunkel grunted

  the blue-eyed blonde stepped forward and
peered through the open doorway oh hello



made his temples ache by rights we oughta split
that eighty he
said you was
mixed up with
that blonde too

 the tilton
terror shook his
bullet - shaped
skull oh no
not me i didnt
want no part of
her she was all
yours ham you
remember how
you tole me to lay
off

 mr hunkel
frowned
grunted okay

ill take it on the
chin we go to
the bank the first
thing in the
morning and
draw out the
dough

 mr belcher
licked his dry
lips youre

i just --iove
strong m e n
bunny cooed


snappy

she greeted cheerily managing to lean in a position
that made her unbrassiered hillocks fall lushly into
the loose front of her frock were selling lot-
tery tickets and we thought youd like to buy
some she said sweetly

  mr hunkel dropped the police gazette over
the far side of the bed stood up with amazing
agility he looked the blonde over from head to
toe in one swift glance and the glitter in his eyes
seemed to indicate he approved-heartily

  dont keep ladies standing in the hall biff
he said that aint right ask em in

  the ladies didnt wait to be asked they stepped
into the bedroom

hphe tilton terror closed the door behind
them spent the next few moments taking an
inventory of the brunettes plentifully revealed
charms just as mr hunkel seemed satisfied with
the lighter-haired lady so mr belcher found the
dark sloe-eyed beauty in rare form in fact he
couldnt remember offhand where he had seen a
more fetching figure

  youve got a nice room here the brunette
said our room isnt so large

  mr hunkel smiled affably rubbed the palms of
his hamlike hands together you live in this
house

  the girls nodded on the third floor the
blonde said my name is bunny taylor my
girl friend is peggy lord

  mr ham hunkel bowed from the waist
ham hunkel is my name baby they bill me
as the georgia killer but dont let that frighten
you pm gentle as a lamb with the ladies

  the tilton terror stepped into the limelight
pm biff belcher pleased tmeetcha he took
peggys hand in his own gigantic paw squeezed it
meaningfully too bad we didnt know you lived
in the house

  peggy drew a deep breath swelled her already
large bouncing bosom yeah it is too bad you
look like a couple of real he-men theyre sure
hard to find these days

hp he belcher and hunkel chest measurements
- increased a good five inches were wrest-
lers baby the georgia killer exclaimed proudly
me and biff here are two of the best in the busi-
ness there aint nobody we aint throwed at one
time or another zybysko man mountain dean
strangler lewis and-

i throwed lewis mr belcher interjected i
throwed him in two minutes and fourteen seconds
mr hunkel glowered yeah but who
throwed indian mike huh and who throwed
dago donnelli huh

  the tilton terror flexed his biceps pounded
his fists on his chest i throwed lewis he in-
sisted doggedly

  you mustnt fight about it bunny the blonde
said you both look very strong i love strong
men she turned to the brunette dont you
peggy

  peggy nodded i adore them

  feel that muscle mr belcher said tendering
his bent right arm

  feel this one mr hunkel offered

  the session of muscle-feeling brought forth an
assortment of exclamations from the girls the
tilton terror went so far as to strip off his jacket
roll up his shirt sleeves and show them how he
could make his biceps dance mr hunkel not to
be outdone pulled up the legs of his trousers and
displayed calves that were almost the size of beer
kegs

  its all too thrilling for words peggy the
brunette gasped it makes me sick when i think
that we had two famous wrestlers living in the
same house with us and we didnt even know it

r hunkel grinned well you know
it now baby he slipped an arm about the
blondes waist better late than never is what i
say how about coming out for a good time huh
theres a swell band at the joyland dance palace
we can shake a couple of rhumbas and have a
couple of drinks

  bunny true to her name cuddled up to mr
ham hunkel gee that would be swell she
purred

  mr belcher sidled over to the brunette looped
an arm about her waist does it sound good to
you baby he drew her close enough to feel
the soft warm pressure of her breath-taking
mounds on his barrel chest

  peggy ran her hands over the tilton terrors
muscular shoulders it sounds perfect to me
im crazy about dancing but really we didnt
expect to be taken out tonight we j ust came down
to sell you a lottery ticket

  whats the lottery

  oh its a thousand dollar lottery that some
nodal organization is running the tickets are only
a quarter apiece and you have a chance of winning
a thousand dollars weve only got two left and
you wont have to wait long to know whether
youve won because the drawing is tomorrow
afternoon

  ill take both of them baby the tilton
terror said grandiloquently

  the georgia killer flared up oh no you

snappy

he-men theyre
hard to find
these days

 you can each

peggy said she pro-
duced t w o printed

ing it to mr belcher

  we win if we lose mr hunkel said affably
come on lets start goin places and doin things

said what time is it anyway

  eleven oclock mr hunkel said the
nights just beginning

  meet you downstairs bunny said she stood
up on tiptoe kissed the georgia killers cheek
ooh pm so happy

  forgotten were the pages and pages of figuring
mr belcher had done forgotten were the harsh
words that had passed between them forgotten
was everything but the prospects of an exciting
evening

boy that bunny is sure a swell looking num-
ber mr ham hunkel exclaimed while plas-
tering his hair down before a mirror

no flies on peggy mr belcher countered
polishing his shoes with a towel say now that
we got everything divvied
up how do we work this
date each man for him-
self

mr hunkel swung
around from the mirror
for six years we
been splittin
everything -
he said there
aint no reason why
we should stop
now is there
yeah but i
didnt split with
you on them or-
chards you sent to
that cootch dan-
cer mr belcher
said timidly

  to hell with
them orchards
mr hunkel bel-
lowed we do
the same like we
used to-every-
thing -
okay

peggy and
bunny were
waiting for them
outside the board-
ing house mr
hunkel hailed a
taxi ten minutes
later they were
dancing to the hot
hectic rhythms of gus gozling and his grena-
diers the joyland palaces stellar swing band

  mr hunkel was in seventh heaven the moment
he got blonde bunny into his arms and against his
massive body her sharp jutting breasts against
his chest raised his temperature a few degrees
started the perspiration rolling down his thick neck

  you can sure step baby he complimented
tightening his arm about her narrow waist so that
his fingers touched the soft undulating curve above
her hips

  bunny looked up at him out ofround blue eyes
that promised everything under the sun youre
not so bad yourself big boy


snappy

  mr belcher was making similar progress with
peggy at the other end of the dance floor he
too was suffering pangs of desire engendered by
the soft warm pressure of peggys voluptuously
full body against his

  you and mr hunkel are very good friends
arent you peggy questioned

  the tilton terror nodded vehemently sure
thing me and ham are like this he crossed
two of his fingers behind her back we been to-
gether for six years

   there was a soulful expression in peggys eyes
i think thats wonderful she said softly

tt was three in the morning when the four-
some returned to their boarding house both
the tilton terror and the georgia killer had
made decided progress en route from the joyland
dance hall the killers mouth was a red smear
and the terrors cheeks resembled those of a scar-
let fever victim

   too bad there aint no parlor we could sit out
in mr hunkel said me im just beginning
to get wound up

  bunny and peggy exchanged meaningful
glances weve got two rooms bunny said your
room and our room that should be enough
messrs hunkel and belcher suited the action
to the suggestion in less time than it takes to tell
it they had separated the georgia killer and
bunny vanishing behind the door of the mens bed-
room and the tilton terror with peggy in tow
marching up to the third floor and the girls bed
room

  too bad we didnt think to bring up a bottle
of something mr biff belcher said once he was
alone with the orchidaceous brunette

  peggy smiled invitingly sidled up to him ran
her hands over his broad bulging shoulders we
really dont need it do we biff darling she
cooed

   the tilton terrors intoxication was sudden but
complete-without benefit of spiritus frumenti
his arms went around peggys slender waist and
he drew her close in a bear hug that almost flat-
tened her soft bosom on his chest

teggy was no neophyte in the art of amour

  she knew her way around and the road wasnt a
strange one her hands slid up over biff belchers
shoulders linked themselves behind his thick neck

  hold m e tight honey she murmured
throatily

  the tilton terror almost crushed the breath
out of her body his mouth jammed down on
her red moist lips and his hands swept over her
ripe soft curves

  peggy drew her lips away slowly tantalizingly
i think id better take my dress off biff she
said youre liable to tear it

  nothing could have pleased the tilton terror
better he looked on goggle-eyed as she raised
the hem of her frock and pulled it over her dark
head she was wearing sleazy peach rayon panties
with an imitation lace trim but as far as the tilton
terror was concerned they might have been
fashioned from the finest chinese silk her
plump bulging roundures were encased in the fish-
net cups of what passed for a brassiere all the
rest was nude creamy-white flesh that made the
blood in biffs veins reach the temperature of
molten lead

  there thats better peggy exclaimed swell-
ing her voluptuous bosom with a deep breath

  the tilton terror stumbled over his own feet
in his eagerness to get to her he swept her body
into his arms lifted her off the floor the palpi-
tating warmth of her against him made his head
spin like a top

  in the other room mr ham hunkel was
slowly recovering from what had been a raptur-
ously thrilling experience you and me have got
to see more of each other baby he panted caress-
ing the smooth alabaster slope of bunnys shoulder

  bunny quivered passionately in his arms how
about meeting me tomorrow after work i know
a swell roadhouse on the island

  its a date the georgia killer replied re-
turning to the delightful business of exploring
more of the blondes caressable charms

at  the following evening mr ham
hunkel arrayed in his best checked suit met
bunny on a designated midtown corner

  she ran up to him her eyes aglow ham
she gasped guess what happened

  mr hunkels plug-ugly pan expressed com-
plete lack of understanding

  bunny didnt wait for him to respond the
lottery she blurted biff belcher won it
the news failed to please mr hunkel he
frowned and his face darkened oh yeah he
muttered

  he doesnt know he won it yet bunny said
he doesnt really have to know if you dont want
him to

  the georgia killers eyes narrowed what
do you mean

  i mean that we dont have to tell him a
thousand dollars is a lot of money we could have
a swell time on a thousand dollars ham

  the germ of deceit planted in the georgia
killers mind grew like a weed

   dear miss wolf

   whats all this swing business i mean a fellow
   told me he was going to teach me how to swing i
   had heard so much about swinging i thought i ought
   to know well believe it or not i got anew swing
   dress and out we went in the moonlight

   i always thought it was some kind of a dance but
   all this dodo did was take me in a hammock and did
   we swing what would you do-get a book and learn
   the swing dance all by myself

                            toots

dear toots

   of course anything a girl can learn from a book
is just so much to the good  understand you can
learn to sew and cook and make cocktails from a
book but when it comes to swinging-i think
every girl just has to go out and learn by exper-
ience i hope i have helped you because thats
what im here for

   dear miss wolf

    ive just joined a wrestling class for girls the idea
    being self-defense i find it is so much fun that i want
    to wrestle all the time and the only way i can work
    it is to bribe the teacher to stay after hours what
    would be a good way to bribe a teacher

                     battling babe

dear battling babe

   there are a number of standard bribes such as
a nice big apple then there is candy and flowers
if your teacher hasnt hay fever of course if
your teacher is really in love with the game you
shouldnt have any trouble    that is if you
are a smart little wrestler personally i got
wrestling all out of my system back in the days of
the old model t fords

   dear trixie wolf

    im getting so i just love to neck with my boy friend
    because he seems to know just how to treat a girl who
    is romantic and in the spirit of the thing so to speak
    the trouble is he cant take it and always wants to
    stop kissing just as the future looks rosy what would
    you do

                                      fifi

dear fifi

   id shoot him

    dear trixie

    i had a rubber bathing suit made and want to use
    it in an indoor pool but what worries me is rubber
    stretches and what will happen if i stretch it all out

                         mermaid

dear mermaid

   if your figure is such that you stretch out rubber
bathing suits rather if your figure stretches out
rubber bathing suits the best thing you can do is
either get a new figure or a new bathing suit i
understand that its quite the thing nowadays to do
your indoor bathing in the dark and then of course
you dont need a bathing suit at all maybe that
would be your solution

    dear trixie

    is it true that the strip tease is not being done
    any more i just took a course and learned to do it
    just dandy isnt there something i could do with my
    newly acquired talent

                        gypsy gogo

dear gypsy gogo

   you might entertain your friends by stripping
instead of playing the guitar or harmonica or
you might get a job in an underwear store and
make the place look prosperous heres how you
could work it whenever a customer comes in
you start your strip act and that makes it look
as if you were going to buy the place out the
customers will be so fascinated by your act that
theyll try it too and first thing you know theyre
down to their undies-and you can say you
ought to have one of our black and pink combina-
tions theyre deee-vine i dont know why i give
away such valuable hints unless its because im in
love with my work let me know how you come
out of your underwear

   dear trix

    is it love when a fellow bites yoor ear and crushes
    you to him

                            kate

dear kate

   it aint the measles you can be sure of that


by malcolm post

do you often take my
picture out to admire it
she asked gaily

red headed
venus

r j  he bell in the foyer of the studio rang
 violently with a smothered exclamation
 tommy bronson went to answer it it was
probably a bill collector commercial art was all
right when the orders poured in when they
didnt it was a case of where theres a will theres
a way and when theres a bill to pay were away
but tommy was home and couldnt stall he
opened the door instead of a man with a familiar

piece of paper in his hand a gorgeous red headed
girl stood on the threshold

sally tommy exclaimed

she looked apprehensively over her shoulder
before she brushed past him with a may i come
in ive got to see you tommy its so im-
portant the worst possible thing has happened
stans coming here this afternoon

tommys brows went up stan that meant




snappy

sallys fiance stanley hodges the other was a
wealthy play boy who had more money than he
knew what to do with often tommy thought
that sally had certainly tumbled into the lap of
luxury

  from artist model existing on hot dogs to a
millionaires wife leading a pekingese-that was
something

  whats all the excitement ill be very glad
to meet your fiance ive heard so much about
him-

  sally clutched tommys arm her beautiful
oval blue eyes were wide with anxiety her full
seductive lips trembled and emotion seemed to
make her slim perfect figure vibrant and quivery
you dont understand stan wants to see the
pictures you used me as model for oh tommy
therell be no wedding bells old shoes or rice if
he ever sees that nude-the one you called red
headed venus

  dont worry tommy soothed hes got
about as much chance of laying an eye on that as i
have of being made minister to siam its locked
up safe and sound if stan wants to see your pic-
tures ill show him all the lovely heads we did for
toothpaste ads theres nothing at all to worry
about

gradually sallys fear dwindled she
puffed on the cigarette tommy lighted and
began to smile tommy looked at her gravely
she was one of the mysteries of his young life
the mystery was that he had never fallen in love
with her-even during those engrossing hours
when as a whim he had persuaded her to pose
nude for what he believed was a masterpiece

  guess ill hop along i feel so much better
im banking on you tommy see you later this
afternoon

  sure by the way what does the boy friend
drink-scotch or rye

  both sally flung him a smile from the
doorway if you havent got either trot out
some of your turpentine-thatll do

  the door closed and tommy walked thought-
fully back through the studio he glanced at the
locked closet containing the red headed venus
his eyes were retrospective with memory when
he went through the foyer and into the dressing
room beyond

  there a statuesque brunette had just completed
fastening her brassiere over two glorious breasts
in the sun that streamed in she was regal imper-
ious stately and magnificent her name was
jacqueline merton but everyone called her jack
she was tommys latest model for some lingerie
posters he was doing on speculation

   all jack wore besides the brassiere was a pair of
step-ins briefly modish that tommy was putting
on canvas

   jack turned and sat down on a studio divan it
was the type that could be pulled out and made
into a bed a half dozen cushions banked it she
dented one of them with her lustrous dark head
crooked an inviting finger and sighed

  who was the dame

   sally blair the girl who used to work for me
before you came

   the redhead who posed for that nude

tommy sat down beside her he looked at
her slowly she was perfect each curve ajid
contour was like that of some wondrous statue
her eyes were dark and dreamy and her patch of
a mouth was scarlet temptation

   sssh easy  the nude stuff

   meaning the redheads boy friend might not
like to find out his little bride once sat for you in
the altogether

  whos been telling you things tommy
asked surprised

  what do you think i have ears for jack
drawled listen why dont you make yourself
some real dough you claim youre broke heres
a chance to wait until theyre married and shake
hodges down for a piece of coin you know
make him buy the nude or youll put it in a fifth
avenue art dealers window

   tommy laughed as he took her in his arms
jack im surprised at you why thats black-
mail where do you ever get such lurid ideas
youre seeing too many high society movies
jack smiled drowsily she turned over on her
side assuming a languorous attractive posture
her pose brought her hips into prominence her
skin was velvet white a foil for her dark hair and
eyes

   tommy crushed her madly to him kissing her
mouth with all the fervor he could summon

at three oclock sally and stanley hodges
made their appearance tommy had seen to
it that jack had the afternoon off he didnt want
stan to think his studio was overrun with beautiful
girls he wanted to give sallys fiance the im-
pression it was a place of serious business

  he showed hodges all the toothpaste adver-
tisements he had used sally for the other nodded
his satisfaction

   thats all she posed for mr bronson
yep thats everything tommy lied cheer-
fully

  arent they pretty sally asked avoiding
tommys eyes
snappy



  im glad hodges grunted chap i know
said all you artists paint your models in the nude
when you get hold of an attractive one

  hes nuts tommy said quickly maybe
some artists do not me this racket of mine is the
same as any other business theres no fun on the
side its all straight from the
shoulder and strictly routine

  hodges had another highball and
left on the way out sally squeezed
tommys hand gratefully he shut
the door after them took
a cigarette and unlocked
the closet

  putting his red headed
venus on an easel tommy
sat down to admire it he

ture to paint again everything would be different
he couldnt put her on canvas now uninspired by
the thrill of her beauty and the lure of her white
skin that made him think of jack what was

smoked pensively yes the work was the best
thing he had ever done his pulses began to stir
as he looked at sallys figure

  strange the jack of excitement there had been
while he was doing it his pulses increased their
beat as he looked at her lithe sweetly curved
young body he was sure that if he had the pic-

tommy crushed her madly to
him with all the fervor he
could summon

he anyhow some kind of a doddering old sultan
falling for every pretty face he saw he shrugged
he was infatuated with jack and that was sufficient
unto the moment

a knock on the door ended his reverie bill
collector he disguised his voice and spoke
with a japanese accent who dere if you please
sah

  sallys cheerful tones filtered through me
tommy open up and send the jap servant back
to tokio you were sweet she went on when
he admitted her i came all the way back to thank
you

  wheres stan

  sally scaled her hat across the studio she
looked ravishing with her glowing blue eyes and
exotic coloring had a business engagement with


snappy

some man at his club i wont see him again until
tomorrow let me sit down and cool off ive
been on needles and haystacks all day oh she
exclaimed catching sight of the canvas on the easel
my picture

   i was just admiring it tommy murmured a
trifle awkwardly

   sally considered her painted image do you
often do that i mean take it out and look at it
sometimes

   she gave him a heavy-lidded glance youre
a funny boy tommy i never did understand
you when i posed for you i might have been a
block of stone for all the interest you took now

hey cut that out youre going to be mar-
ried first thing you know ill be crying
on your shoulder

   tommy let me be a little sentimental you
dont know how im going to miss all the fun we
had the quick lunches the times when you
couldnt work and prowled around like an angry

bear the days when inspiration flowed like a
river and i had to hold the pose for years without
end tommy we did have good times-

  ill say he murmured

  lets have one more night im free and easy
stans busy this evening and you can take me to
dinner and a show or anything you want just
for auld lang syne want to

  you bet

  okay you can start with giving me my usual
kiss

  a very platonic one of course

  of course

  tommy put his arms around her the kind
an old employer gives the
fiancee of a wealthy young
playboy something like
this-

  as he kissed her
tommy looked over her
shoulder and into the eyes
of the shameless young
lady who sat unclothed on
the canvas stretched on the
easel

  there was nothing pla-
tonic in the kiss it was
a flaming ecstatic kiss that
shook tommy down to his
shoes sally seemed to
enjoy it too she clung to
him tightly her arms
twined hungrily around
his neck

he kissed her four
or five times more
before she let him go
first thing well put
venus back in her cubby
hole tommy said fol-
lowing the suggestion with
action he stowed the
picture away in the closet
want to wash up or any-
thing im going to take
you to dine in the sky room of the new hotel
promenade

  they had a happy dinner way up among the
clouds the rhythm band was a good one
tommy loved to dance so did sally they
made a cute couple as they hot-footed it around
the crystal floor

  it was dark when they decided to go the ele-
vator dropped them down to the street level like a
couple of burned out skyrockets tommy wound
his arm around sallys

nothing like finding out
about your fiancee before
you get married he heard
stan reply

when im booked to be married
you take out the picture and grow
sentimental over it

   who said i was sentimental

  sally walked over to him

look at yourself in the mirror

your eyes are full of dreams your face is all
shadowy with memories tommy you do like me
a little
snappy



  do you want to go to a show he asked

  not necessarily

  what then

  id like to go back to the studio

  he gave her a quick glance her blue eyes
were sparkling and a little pulse throbbed in her
throat suddenly tommy got that way too all
warm and expectant inside

  swell taxi

  lets ankle why spend money

  so they hoofed it uptown to the studio building
tommy was a little worried the statuesque jack
had a key of her own often when the mood
seized her she manipulated the lever of the divan
in the dressing room so that it became a bed and
spent the night there

  tommy fervently hoped jack wouldnt be on
hand when they got in she wasnt but she had
stopped off there after he and sally had left for
dinner he could tell by the number of lipsticked
cigarette stubs in the marble ashtray on top of the
cellarette

sally drew a breath when he turned on one of
the lamps her eyes danced with mysterious
happiness she made herself comfortable in the
studio while tommy dug out a battered shaker and
began brewing some of his special cocktails

  just like old times sally smiled joyfully

  even to the ice cubes that didnt freeze
tommy chuckled

  they toasted each other sally stared pensively
at him over the rim of her glass im going to miss
you terrifically nice boy stans taking me to france
on a honeymoon there wont be a frenchman
in the whole country as fascinating as you

  how do you know when youve never been
there

  im sure of it tommy do you have to sit so
far away-

  he got up and sally perched herself on his lap
that was much better more intimate and ever so
cozy her closeness began to arouse queer stimu-
lating longings in tommy when his hand rested
on her and he felt how warm and soft she was his
heart thumped

  it was a shame she was getting married and
stepping forever out of his life she laid her
cheek against his and he had to kiss her closed eyes
the tip of her retrousse nose and her lips

  it was while he was doing that that he noticed
something that sent a cold chill to cut through his
emotion like the blade of a sharp sword he was
careful not to alarm sally very casually he said
do me a favor lets go in the dressing room
you turn on the lights like a good girl while i
gather up the glasses-

sally skipped away into the other room
tommy made straight for the closet the
door as he had observed was slightly ajar he
opened it quickly and a single glance was enough
to verify his worst suspicions

  the red headed venus was gone

  tommy did some quick thinking after a
minute or two he went into the dressing room
sally he began slowly ive just thought of
something i have an appointment across town
its highly important could you wait here for
a little while-until i get back i wont be long

  ill wait sally replied itll give me a
chance to do a little sentimental retrospecting of
my own but you could kiss me good-bye-

  tommy jammed on a hat and sprinted for the
street he caught a taxi there and hurled an ad-
dress at the driver in less than ten minutes he was
in front of the apartment house where jack had a
two-room suite

  tommy had a key to it he went up the stairs
like an antelope cautiously he slid the key into
the lock opened the door by inches and stood stock
still in the tiny foyer

  the aroma of cigarette smoke mingled with the
subtle scent of alcohol voices low-pitched and
secret crept to him still silently careful tommy
parted the portieres to a crack large enough to per-
mit him a view of the room beyond them

the first thing he saw was jack in a filmy neg-
ligee then he recognized stan hodges his
arms around her then his inquisitive gaze
focused on the red headed venus propped up
against a chair

  arent you glad i got you the picture jack
was saying in a soft caressing tone

  you bet stan replied thickly nothing
like finding out about your fiancee before you get
married he patted the brunettes bare arm
affectionately honey youre gonna like paris-
those frogs legs and things well sail tomorrow
get married when we dock ill buy you all the
clothes-

  tommy didnt wait to hear any more like a
ghost he tiptoed out latched the door soundlessly
behind him and made another dash for the open
spaces of manhattan

  when he got back to the studio it was entirely
dark he thought sally had gotten tired of wait-
ing and had gone home when he went into the
dressing room the moonlight lanced through one
window

sally had made the bed up and was occupying
it she had helped herself to a pair of his pajamas
the sleeves hung over her tapering fingertips the

then she took the
bras miss watson
handed her



by
peg
simon

prue kelcey was stretched full length
on their mutual bed when sally schuyler
wandered in from the bathroom sally
wasnt wearing as much as eve at the time that
famous lady had been dated up by the serpent but
she did modestly hold a damp bath towel up in
front of her

  the trouble with life sally observed
brightly is that its filled with too many employ-
ment agencies and too many sidewalks

  and prue put in lazily too many heels to
pound em

  sally sighed casting away the towel and giving
her apartment-sharer a complete view of her lovely
young body and it was lovely chief among
sallys charms were heavy but firm globes of
beauty that jutted from her marble-textured figure
with the effect of snowy mountains prue thought
of her own small teacup hillocks and felt the usual
twinge of envy if i had your figure she said




snappy

softly id go places in a big way you own a
couple of valuable assets and dont know it
sally smiled as she turned to the mirror she
straightened to her full five feet six inches like
a slim arrow she faced the glass she ran slow
caressing hands over her deep fascinating bosom
tenderly and observed the picture she made still
smiling maybe i do know

  huh prue moved on her pillow whats
that

  i didnt intend telling you until i was sure it
was in the bag sally explained but i got a job
today at the smith-gale department store
prues face fell she made a sound resembling
a bronx cheer in the ribbon department i sup-
pose-selling it by the yard

for a minute more sally appraised her glamor-
ous self she took stock of her sloping shoul-
ders the clean curved lines of her torso the flat-
ness of her dimple-engraved tummy and the sculp-
tured way her thighs rounded out from her engag-
ing hips she began to dress giving the mirror a
rear view that lasted only long enough for her to
climb into her slinky panties not the ribbon
counter hon the brassiere section its only
temporary-for a couple of weeks but its worth
thirty bucks per each six days and thats something
ill say so what do you do

  sally sat on the edge of the bed to don stockings
model brassieres-some special new uplifts the
store is featuring the display is for ladies only
and i start tomorrow drop in and take a peek
i just saw plentyprue grinned she wrinkled
her forehead smith-gale department store
listen once i went out on a likker party with
young jimmy gale hes the son of the party who
has a half ownership in the joint as i remember
jimmy was quite the guy lousy with coin and
fresh as paint

  what does that make me sally asked

  a chump if you dont date him brassieres
and special uplifts thatll be mince pie for
jimmy boy hell be there like bees around clover
you can make him if you try

  the only drawback sally murmured slip-
ping into her skirt being that the old-fashioned
wedding bell has to peal to get any service from
me quaint notion eh i dont go for anyone
unless they want a life job

  prue rolled over and reached for the cigarettes
she lighted one and blew smoke through her tip-
tilted nose youve been dropped on your head
marriage maybe-well if james ever saw what
i just looked at-possibly matrimony would click
i doubt it i know what these rich playboys
are sally replied

bright and early the next morning sally
breezed into the smith-gale emporium on
sixth avenue she went directly to the office of
a miss watson who was in charge of the brassiere
demonstration received instructions and a half
hour later was being used as a living example of
what the product could do for the ordinary woman
if used correctly

   from then until closing time sally patiently put
on and took off her simple silk blouse like an
automaton she took her cues for the various steps
in brassiere wearing while miss watson droned on

   first she stood this way and that so the feminine
audience might see and dwell upon the firmness
and size of her beguiling breasts then she took
the bras miss watson handed her figure three
was the placing of the snowy mounds in the pink
silk cups of the uplift sally did it slowly one
at a time

   then as a final gesture she snapped the patent
clasp at her smooth unblemished back and turned
around and around so all might see with what
supple snugness her charms had been enclosed

  it wasnt hard work but it was tiresome every
hour sally was allowed fifteen minutes rest she
retired to a screen and chair at the rear of the place
and rested there

  it happened on her third day at the department
store

  then on the hour when sally wearily went be-
hind the screen she almost collided with a young
man who stood in its shadow one eye applied to a
crack where the panels joined

  with a smothered exclamation sallys arms flew
up to hide what a few dozen women had already
beheld with admiration and jealousy color
stained her piquant face her eyes flashed indig-
nantly what are you doing back here she de-
manded

  getting an eyeful i only heard about the
exhibit this morning when i reported for work

sally stared he was quite attractive he
had an amiable smile but there was something
about him that made her suspicious of his motives
maybe it was the manner in which he looked at
her or his sensual mouth with its almost leering
smile

  youd better go before i speak to miss
watson sally advised shell have you fired

  he laughed with genuine amusement think
so if wattie opens her face to me shell go out
on her-ear why because im jimmy gale
my old gent runs this foundry and being a chip off
the old blockhead ive got quite a little to say too
authoratively speaking that is

   oh sally said faintly
with an exclamation
sallys arms sew up

what are you doing back
here she demanded

  he stepped closer sally kept her
arms glued over her bosom he
laughed under his breath

  i like your looks youve got
what impresses me i think id
enjoy taking you out what have
you got on tonight

 heavy underwear-long red
and woolly sally couldnt resist
saying

  ill meet you in the lobby of the
royale hotel at eight-thirty gale stated pre-
cisely dont be late i hate gals who wander in
twenty minutes or a half hour overtime

  and if i dont keep the date

  his leering smile gave way to a frown his
sword-sharp gaze made valiant efforts to probe
behind sallys folded arms youd better i
understand youre only here f two weeks-just

for this brassiere demonstration racket you be
nice to me and ill hire you for my private secre-
tary at around fifty bucks each pay day sound
good

for the rest of the day sally thought it over
jimmy gale wasnt her type she knew exactly
what he was and what he wanted he was one of




snappy

those amorous youths with nothing on his mind
except a good time he was the opposite of every-
thing she liked and respected

  still as she had told prue there were so many
employment agencies and so many miles of hard
cement pavements fifty bucks a week for that
amount sally decided she could swallow her dis-
like and repugnance

  besides she had always wanted to be a private
secretary though not too private

  when her day of uplift finally ended she went
to the washroom and tidied her auburn hair
washed her hands and powdered her nose then
she took the employees elevator to the basement
exit

  a tall slender young man stood beside her in
the lift he had a serious good looking face
friendly gray eyes and a vast amount of person-
ality he had only to look at her to make sally
aware of the latter she wondered who he was
probably just a wage slave like herself in the busy
hive of the great department store

  he smiled as he stepped aside to let her pass
sally noticed his flashing white teeth she looked
back over her shoulder as she went on to the swing-
ing doors the young man stood a little to the left
of the elevator staring after her a minute later
miss watson emerged from the lift and the last
glimpse sally had was of the one with the gray eyes
stopping to speak to the brassiere lecturer

back at the apartment she found a scribbled
note from prue the other girl had been in-
vited out to dinner by some hardware buyer from
scranton  hope he doesnt bolt on me prue
wrote humorously id like to have him go nuts
about me slightly screwy but not chisel how
did the job go today and when are you going to
hunt up jimmy the perfect answer to the working
girls prayer

  sally smiled slightly shed have something to
tell prue in the morning she thought a lot about
the private secretary job while she took a quick
shower and put on her best and only dinner dress

  the royale hotel wasnt far from the apart-
ment when sally went into its ornate lobby the
marble clock on duty told her the time was exactly
eight-thirty

  jimmy gale threw away his cigarette and got up
to greet her on the dot nice gal had din-
ner

  you didnt say anything about it so i wrestled
with a cheese sandwich sally said again feeling
the slight wave of repulsion that had come when
she had found him behind the screen

  ive got something on four wheels that purrs
and runs around its parked outside i know a

place up westchester way where they plant a tasty
chicken and water it with the juice of the grape
this way please no trouble at all to display our
goods

  presently sally found herself tucked in the
front seat of a rakish roadster that seemed a block
long its sixteen cylinders sang a song of silken
power almost before she was aware of it they
were flashing swiftly along one of the open roads
above van courtlandt park

  sally was really hungry when they reached their
destination this was a wayside inn with a bril-
liant neon sign writhing across its facade it was
called champ sadlers apple orchard sally re-
membered reading about it it was a place fre-
quented by broadway and park avenue celebrities
by the sporting fraternity gamblers gunmen and
sightseers

she expected theyd sit on the terrace where a
famous swing band made delectable music for
dancing instead gale hailed a head waiter had
a whispered conference and then ushered her to
the floor above and one of the private supper
rooms

  sally knew a qualm of suspicion she didnt like
that so much still she thought she was well
equipped to take care of herself and the place
though notorious wasnt taking any chances of
running afoul of the law a motorcycle cop had
been on duty at the gate sally recalled when she
had come in

  for the next half hour sally ate while jimmy
gale drank his supper she had never been out
with such a thirsty young man he literally poured
it down his face reddened and coarsened his
sensual mouth grew even more so but he was evi-
dently an old hand at the down-the-hatch thing
no matter how much he imbibed he didnt grow
unsteady thick-tongued or tight liquor seemed
to sharpen his wits if anything and his wise-cracks
were fast and pointed

  sally grew aware that his gaze never left her
as time passed it fastened on her more completely
it swept over her as if he were mentally disrobing
her she had the peculiar feeling of standing nude
before him and it wasnt very pleasant

  about this secretary job gale said after
awhile sound good

   id like to try it

  fine the first requirement of a private sec-
retary is that she must be a good lap-sitter she
should know how to curl up and of course take
plenty of dictation suppose we try it out now and
see how it goes he sat down on the rooms
small couch heres the lap ready and willing
bring your hips over and park em
be a sport and play
the game he coaxed
what have you got to
lose

o	ally shook her head sorry that isnt the
 kind of work im looking for

jimmy gale raised a trick eyebrow no he
sneered i suppose youre perfectly content to
show what youve got to a lot of half-witted women
who buy brassieres and rush home thinking of a
figure like yours

dont be silly youre too good for that
grind

at least sally said coolly i dont have to
sit on anyones lap

the job he continued persuasively has
other inducements for instance you get satur-
days off over the week-end we go places and do
things together

 i can imagine

 naturally i reimburse you for over time
 youre just as apt to find a pear-shaped diamond
 ring in your pay envelope as a hundred buck bill

 not interested sally stated clearly

 but i am

 he got up from the couch and walked toward


so

snappy

her sally couldnt help but see his expression had
changed his face had hardened and his eyes were
over-bright he rested a hand  the table and
leaned to her

  dont be a fool i can do you a lot of good
when i saw you today i decided your number
was up in my little red book come on be a
sport and play the game what have you got to
lose

  something ive grimly clung to for twenty long
years sally answered quietly but you wouldnt
understand mr gale youre not interested in
good character-what
attracts you is the lack of
it and that she
added lets me out

  ally thought i t
was a pretty good
speech she didnt
count  its effect on
jimmy gale she was
totally unprepared when
his hand flashed out
caught the bodice of the
dinner dress and with
dismaying swiftness
ripped it open from shoulder to waist his move
was so sudden she didnt even have time to shield
the heavy milk-white globes from his gloating
gaze-or cover the suave glorious curves of her
torso

  youve got to be reasonable

  there was an odd note in gales passion-thick
voice sally stepped back to avoid the arms he
opened she retreated to the wall he reached
her there and embraced her he held her
arms firmly down so she couldnt pummel him
his mouth hot and eager fastened like a
leech at the hollow in the base of her slender
throat

  what might have happened sally never was
destined to know abruptly like a character in a
screen drama the door of the supper room popped
open and in walked a slender tall young man with
gray eyes

  he hauled jimmy gale away from her clouted
him accurately on the chin pushed him contemp-
tuously aside and smiled at sallys efforts to get the
rent bodice back in place

  if youre ready to leave-

he offered his arm sally peered at him
bewilderedly his presence there was a little
too much for her mind to fully grasp but she

took the offered arm and a few minutes later
climbed into a new car

 how-

  perhaps id better introduce myself the
names hal stanley i had to pump miss watson
plenty to get the information i wanted you
didnt know it but i followed you from the
apartment to the hotel and from the hotel up
here

  it was after eight oclock when sally awoke the
following morning prue was splashing like a seal
in the bathtub sally trailed her nightie in and sat

                   down on the white
                   enameled stool

                       when prue came up
out of the sudsy waters
sally told her story the
other listened in open-
mouthed wonder then
she threw the sponge at
the rack and shook her
head

  hon youll pardon
me if i tell you that
youre a prize dope
and whether or not you
want me to tell you why
im going to do you know what you did
nothing but this you threw away a perfectly
swell chance to ease yourself into the big sugar
you muffed the grandest opportunity of your
young life what of it if mr jimmy gale didnt
appeal to you dont you know that money
covers a multitude of chagrins get that through
that lovely but somewhat empty dome of
yours

  but why dont you listen to me for a minute
sally murmured patiently im trying to tell you
that ive fallen hard for hal hes a perfect
darling it was simply a case of the well-known
love at first sight i couldnt help it besides
hes so different from jimmy he wants whats
right whats wonderful in life he wants a
home-

  prue interrupted sarcastically yeah i know
all about it but what is it going to get you and
how much does he make eighteen per

  sally smiled reminiscently she poked out her
shapely legs and absently caressed her lithe and
sweetly moulded figure more than that i
imagine you see she explained the smith-
gale department store is in the hands of receivers
hals father is the principal creditor and hes there
working on the books daily before they take the
plant over

spellbound

      eyes met mine in gaze enchanting
 their very nearness left me panting

 i didnt speak for whos at ease

he minute lex johnson
finished his shift as bellhop
at the plaza-grand he liked
to doll up and step out of
character lex had illusions
after working hours he got a
kick out of pretending he was
a rich playboy with all of
broadway at his beck and call

  so lex strolling the stem with a wave of his
cane kept a weather eye out for some snappy doll
baby he might impress with his clothes and per-
sonality like the beggar of old lex firmly be-
lieved in kismet-that for everyone in the knock-
kneed metropolis there was always one night given
as a gift of the magi

  so far he hadnt been able to pick up anything
except hungry chorines and dames looking for
carfare but lex wasnt discouraged he figured
that sooner or later fate would step in and hand
him something choice to have fun with it was
that certainty that kept him buoyed up full of ex-
pectancy and pep

  his usual anticipation gave him verve and a
sprightly gait as he wandered down longacre one
early autumn evening a fuzzy new skimmer was
tilted at a rakish angle on his well-shaped head
his freshly cleaned and pressed suit featured a knife
crease trouser edge and his dogs were polished to
a mirror-like shine lex looked like a million
but the truth was he had less than seven ducats in
his kick

  close to the wallington theatre lex slowed
up he took a slant at the photos in the lobby
gorgeous gals wearing a minimum of clothing
smiled at him they were ravishing and lexs
heart skipped a beat that was the type of young
lady he was so anxious to meet-some beautiful
doll who wasnt overdressed and who had a pair
of eyes that gleamed

  the name of the show was she took it off
and the star was virginia hale from the merry
lilt of music seeping out and the time marked by
the clock in the lobby lex decided the piece was in
its final moments he took another gapder at the

pictures and transferred himself to the stage door
alley

  lex breathed hard the daguerreotypes had
done things to his imagination he knew of noth-
ing he wanted more than one of the pictured girls
to do his stuff with propping himself up against
the stage door alley wall he resigned himself to
impatient patience and waited for the performers to
come out

soon the girls began to leave actually they
werent quite as fascinating and pulse-stirring
in real life as they were in the photos somehow
they looked drab tired one little redhead how-
ever appealed to lex as she came forward he
stepped out from the wall howyar babe he
said with a flourish going my way

  the girl stopped looked him over and wrinkled
a pert little nose no she told him sweetly
im not because youd better go home and cut
yourself a piece of throat

  with that she flounced past him lex sighed
and went back to the wall all the ensemble
maidens were gone that left the star and prin-
cipals and lex didnt have much hope of making
any one of those dames they were usually met by
red-necked gentlemen in shining sedans

  lex was about to fling his brogans into third when
he stopped short a girl had stepped from the
stage door she was rather small and wore a short
fur coat over a silver net gown in the wan light
of the alley her chestnut hair had a polished glim-
mer to it and her eyes were as bright and alive as
if they had absorbed some of the glow of the foot-
lights

  as she came out the stagedoor man tipped his
hat respectfully good night miss hale

  lexs pulses pounded virginia hale star of
the extravaganza one of the blue ribbon pretties
of yawn boulevard what he had read about her
swarmed through his mind once she had been
an artists model her figure was supposed to be
tops in the world of curves and contours

  as she drew even with lex he-caught the drift
of her perfume and heard the tap of high heels


her eyes drifted to him casually she went on
but stopped at the end of the alley turned and

                                  looked up and
                                  down the

and bowed may i get you a taxi miss
hale

  taxi she laughed a little to lex it was
like the music of a silvery woodland stream
perhaps youd better i told ronald to have
the town car here at eleven-thirty and theres

                          no sign of him
                          accident may-
                          be lexs tone
                          was easy or too
                          many tall ones i

s


snappy

know my man cant be depended upon either
he hesitated if you could walk to the cor-
ner-

   certainly its nice of you to help me

  a pleasure there was real enthusiasm in
lexs voice you see miss hale ive been ad-
miring you all evening from row a in the or-
chestra i-to tell the truth ive been hanging
around the stage door since the show ended hop-
ing for another glimpse of you

  really she lifted her eyes they wan-
dered over lex speculatively they took in the
details of the new hat the well-creased trousers
im flattered

   there were plenty of cabs available on the stem
lex hardly had a finger up before three were fight-
ing to reach the curb in that half second that came
before a door opened for the girl lex felt his heart
syjlc

   always one night was his to end before it
began he took his courage by the nape of the
neck and shook it

  if i could see you home miss hale-

  would you her red lips parted i-
candidly im a little afraid of taxicabs at this
hour

a ll the violins in the universe played for lex
  as he handed her into the ark what matter
that it was slightly fragrant with stale gin fumes
or there were no cut roses in the vase that had seen
much service as an ash receptacle

   the most beautiful dame in all creation was be-
side him and to lex life was unfolding gloriously

  her shoulder brushed his as their vehicle
threaded the manhattan side streets almost be-
fore lex knew it they were on park avenue the
can slid to a stop before a tall cloud-bumping
building

   once more lex went to the mat with his courage
if i could come up for a minute miss
hale-

   the dreamy eyes turned in his direction of

course you didnt think i hope i was going to
send you away without a drink after youve been
so kind and helpful

  lex almost swooned with delight when a pri-
vate elevator rushed them skywards another
minute and she was unlocking the door of a pent-
house apartment the lights clicked on lex
looked through a foyer and into the most heavenly
room he had observed anywhere

  it was all in striking black-and-silver with a
black glass floor and chromium furniture uphol-
stered in shimmering silver one wall was a win-
dow that gave him an aviator view of gotham in
all its crowded majesty

  but to lex the view of the girl before him was
much more interesting

   she slipped off the fur wrap and stood revealed
in the close-clinging mesh gown the perfection
of her young body was glamorous and thrilling
in front the dress was cut so that the upper halves
of her firm upthrust breasts swelled from their
lacy confinement her waist was narrow but her
hips even though girdled were flat and interest-
ing

nphrough lex a delicious current of hot
eagerness ran temptingly what a gal what
charm what loveliness what attraction he
swallowed blinking at her as she smiled
slowly

  youll have to pardon the service tonight my
butler is away

   she snapped on a radio excused herself and left
the room lex sank down on a deeply uphol-
stered couch he had trouble keeping his emotions
in leash he told himself it was absurd to even
hope or think he could make a girl like virginia
hale she was a big broadway star she wouldnt
allow any thomas richard and harry to pick her
up the whole thing was ridiculous on the face of
it and what a sweet countenance it was

   still his thoughts ran confusedly she had let
him get the cab had agreed readily to his com-
panionship and she had brought him up to the
apartment

  kismet

  perhaps she was lonely even box-office stars
were human perhaps her best boy friend had had
an argument or something with her and walked
out there were dozens of possibilities lex de-
cided to go along with the tide and see what hap-
pened only time could tell

  when lex looked up she had come back into
the room a silver salver graced a table crowned
with bottles and glasses lex hardly saw that
his eyes bulged as they fell on the girl she had
taken advantage of his thinking period to change
snappy



from the mesh gown to something more com-
fortable

  now she wore a long hostess robe it was of
some thin diaphanous material every step she
took flexed it to her in such a way that lex was able
to see she wore little or nothing beneath it the
lace bras had been removed and the confining
girdle as well he had the impression of her silk-
swathed legs and of a shadow around her middle
that might have been made by the tiniest and scan-
tiest of panties

  you mix she said im terrible at it

lex did-with unsteady hands he couldnt
believe his eyes-or luck virginia hale
close to him in a costume that left little to the imag-
ination the kind of girl he had dreamed about
for so many weary nights the kind of gal he put
on the terrier to impress

  somehow lex forgot his role of gilded idler
it seemed unnecessary with virginia she was so
nice so friendly he didnt have to do any im-
pressing she seemed more than anxious to meet
him halfway in everything he did

  possibly she liked him lex hadnt thought of
that after all he was young fairly good looking
and had a nice personality maybe he was getting
himself across without effort

  as he poured and stirred and shook lex
searched his memory for all details and scraps of
information he could remember having read
about her tie vaguely recalled a wealthy wall
street man-someone by the name of bruce
whiteside-that winchell and other broadway
columnists linked with her lex stowed the fact
aside as he carried a
gold cup over to her

  try this if it
snarls at you ill go to
work on a new one

  its like nectar
she murmured sip-
ping it

  lex sat down be-
side her her near-
ness unnerved him

she looked so soft and
relaxed s o desirable
and so tempting he
wondered what she
would do if he put out
a hand and touched
her he had a mad
desire to know what
her skin felt like-
to learn if it were as
smooth and glistening

 as it looked she frowned as lex mopped his
 forehead are you so warm

 im burning up he told her

 but it isnt hot in here open a window if you
 want

 and have you catch cold not a chance

 she smiled at her thin transparent hostess gown
 thats right i might i hope youll pardon this
 but after the theatre i like to get comfy and
 relax

 you-its wonderful  lex stammered

 i know lots of men i wouldnt dare wear it
 around men who would try to take advantage of
 me but with you she added i feel safe you
 -youre different

 dont be too sure lex said throatily

 her thinly arched brows went up quickly
 what do you mean surely this gown doesnt
 affect you-that way

 lex drew a deep breath i feel just like i did
 when i was a kid at school he blurted we had
 a gorgeous young teacher i sat near her desk
 one day i stayed after school i-she asked me to
 tie her shoe-

 and you did

 yes i did lex mumbled two days later
 i was kicked out of the class

 why

 the principal caught me giving her a new pair
 of garters

 vtirginia hale stretched out a shapely leg

  dancing had made it curved and firm the
 sight of its extended beauty gave lexs heart a twist

 fortunately she
 laughed i have no
 garters-to break
 her mouth tightened
 only a heart she
 said slowly

 at that moment lex
 was sure he had his
 answer of course
 the bruce whiteside
 he had read about had
 walked out on her

 that was the reason
 he was there

 a heart he said
 slowly you mean-
 mr whiteside

 she turned swiftly
 you - youve
 heard

dear snappy editor

  your swell magazine is im-
proving with every issue and last
year when i wrote those very
same words to you i believed it
had just about reached the tops

i	wouldnt miss an issue of
snappyyif i had to walk a mile
to buy it pd walk that mile for
a camel why not a sna ppy

  the drawings by virgie max-
well for the novelettes cant be
beat where does she find such
handsome models to pose for her
we certainly dont see such good
looking fellows out here in ari-
zona where i live editors
note- all handsome arizona
boys please observe if there
are any they certainly do keep
themselves under cover mr
editor i hope they take the hint

       mi ml walker

dear editor

  i	wonder if there is a small
space in your next issue of
snappy magazine for two
lonely soldiers of the western
front that would like to hear
from readers of snappy

  george is  years of age has
black curly hair blue eyes and not
bad to look at he stands five
feet nine inches in his socks and
weighs about  pounds

  david is  years of age has
fair hair blue eyes and fair in

beauty skins deep

  of course bunny said we
wont be able to get the whole thou-
sand but we can get half of it easy

  how

  bunny explained her plan if
they could raise four or five hundred
dollars and buy the tilton terrors
lottery ticket they could cash it in
and clear five hundred dollars ill
get peggy to buy it from him
bunny said with confident assur-
ance

  the plan sounded good to mr
hunkel for more reasons than one

        continued from page 

complexion stands five feel
eleven and one-half inches tall
and his weight is around the -
pound mark

  if any of your readers are in-
terested in writing to two soldiers
from india and of the country we
shall be much obliged if anybody
would write to us and would write
them interesting letters in return
we shall be looking snappy
up every month as we are both
readers of every edition that is
printed so thought we would try
our luck for pen pals through
snappy magazine

we remain

  have you a space in your let-
ter box for the plea of a lonely
reader of snappy your very
excellent magazine  always

hair is brown and my eyes are

together with bunny he hurried to
the bank and withdrew five hundred
dollars from the joint account turned
it over to the blonde schemer come
up to my room tonight about nine
oclock she said and ill have the
thousand

the alarm clock on the belcher
hunkel bureau said a quarter
to nine when both the georgia killer
and the tilton terror roused them-
selves from a forced lethargy and
started for the door where are

       continued from page 
snappy



 you goin  mr hunkel demanded

   where you goin mr belcher
 echoed

   before either of them could reply
 there was a knock at the door the
 georgia killer opened it

   telegrams for hunkel and bel-
 chcr the western union boy an-
 nounced

   two puzzled wrestlers took the
 yellow envelopes slit them the
 blood drained from their faces as
 they read the contents mr hunkel
 looked at mr belcher mr belcher
 looked at mr hunkel the former
 broke the silence

   mine says thanks for the 
 you rummy 

   mr belcher gulped mine says
 the same thing

   it wasnt necessary for them to
 compare notes they knew indi-
 vidually and collectively that they
 had been taken for a thousand dollar
 buggy ride

   mr hunkel looked glum how
 much does that leave us in the bank
 biff

   mr belchers corrugated brow in-
 dicated heavy thinking eighty
 bucks he announced

    it kinda dont pay for us to split
 up then does it  the georgia killer
 queried plaintively

   the tilton terror sighed no
 i guess it dont ham

   they shook hands forcing wan
 smiles misery they were discover-
 ing loves company

gag of the month

this ones clean but funny
a banker being congratu-
lated on having shot the moose
whose fine head reposed over his
fireplace chimed he had bagged

the head while fishing you
see he said i was casting for
trout at a stream in the woods
when my hook caught in the
mooses nose for a moment i
didnt know what to do but i re-
membered i had some turpentine
in my creel i sneaked up behind
the hooked moose and sprinkled
the turpentine on his rear end
it began to itch him and he backed
up to a tree and started to rub
he rubbed and he rubbed and he
rubbed and believe it or not
that pointing to the moose head
was the only part of him left

the whitewash is fading

hp akng a gander at the local
burlesque houses any
mothers son can see that now
with the hue and cry dying down
the strip-tease impressarios are
lifting the lid and slipping back

always one night

his own particular throb lex an-
swered truthfully

  she tapped the gold cup with nails
stained a vivid carmine her small
pursed mouth pouted and her sloe
eyes were dreamy again she moved
a little the gown went with her
and lexs gaze fastened on the front
of it

  bruce she said distinctly was
married last night-in canada i
-ill probably never see him
again

  some note in her hushed voice
affected lex before he knew what
it was all about he had slipped an
arm about her he drew her a little
to him she yielded readily enough
the lashes down over her eyes like
a screen

  poor kid there was a world
of sympathy in lexs tone poor
you

  dont she breathed or youll
have me in tears i-i want to for-
get  i must you can help me to
make me

  her fierce request stirred lex
he caressed her gently she leaned
half against him her head close to
his shoulder his right hand strayed
idly over the curves of her satiny
back she inched herself closer

  yoy-youve been so sweet to
me tonight-how can i ever for-
get

lex laid his lips against her per-
fumed hair waves of emo-
tion washed over like combers on a
frothy sea there was no use trying
to fight off the feeling that gripped
and overpowered him fate had
sealed the matter the instant be had
spoken to her in the stagedoor alley

  this was his night of nights this
was the supreme moment of his life
the gorgeous girl in his arms hurled
and torn by cruel circumstances was
his-and his alone

  the realization made lex go limp
he quivered as his hold on her in-
creased savagely he pulled her up
on his lap the gown slipped over
naked shoulders her chestnut hair
flamed and exuded an intoxicating
perfume

  when lex kissed her she seemed
to stiffen in every muscle her legs
drew up under her her head went
back so that her throat was a white

snappy

continued from page 

column and the gown fluttered wide

  ill make you forget lex
breathed hoarsely

  she quivered at the next touch
of his mouth going limp in his eager
clutching arms

lexs shift was the eleven to
five-thirty at the plaza-grand
the next day gertie one of the
telephone operators gave him her
tabloid and a stick of gum lex sank
wearily down on the bellhop bench
waiting for a flash from the desk

  he had left the penthouse apart-
ment toward six that morning he
had caught a few hours on the pad
but was still tired the magic of the
past lay like burned out embers be-
fore him the worst part of it lex
understood was he would never see
her again and every part of him cried
out for her

  bellhop and broadway star he
grinned crookedly what a break
no more peace of mind for him as
long as he lived racing around
wouldnt help either no dame alive
could ever take the place of the one
his arms had held for all those en-
chanted hours

  lex opened the tabloid the first
thing his eyes fell on were headlines
that held him in a stupefied trance
he read them then the article they
tied up with

  with an inarticulate yelp lex
leaped from the bench twenty
steps took him to the huge switch-
board gertie the blonde plug-
swinger on duty stared at him won-
deringly

  well whats eatin you mr
vanderbilt you look-

  never mind how i look lex
exclaimed read that-

  gertie glanced at the item his
trembling finger pointed out

  nuts i did already twice what
about virginia hale copping a sneak
on broadway to fly to montreal and
marry that big ticker-and-tape worm
called bruce whiteside and what
about the fact she left her under-
study at the theatre and gave the
dame the use of her penthouse apart-
ment-

  thats it lex interrupted hap-
pily get that penthouse on the
wire get it quick-before i suf-
focate

snappy

the tramp

  no said jimmy youre tops
in aviation

  then ask me again said fran-
cine please ask me

  just so you can see me squirm
when you say no snapped jimmy
liis old self again stubborn and re-
sentful dont try to make a fool
of me francine not again please
and it isnt exactly sporting is it
two-timing farris on the eve of the
wedding

  what are you talking about
asked francine puzzled farris is
marrying maizie on monday i told
you that i told you all about their
wedding plans i helped em make
em

  farris and maizie cried jim-
my turning white

  yes i told you i thought you
looked as if youd been konked on
the dome i thought you heard me
and i thought you looked so sick be-
cause of losing maizie i thought
that what maizie told me last night
must have been a lie-just to make
me feel good because i gave farris
the air and she could get him on the
rebound

  what did maizie tell you
that you loved me that you
were eating out your heart on ac-
count of me she said you told her
that said francine softly and
then im not a tramp not really
i never loved farris and he knew it
from the beginning it has always
been you but when you wouldnt
speak to me i tried to love farris i
told him i was trying but i couldnt
make it farris knew why some-
how or other he seemed to under-
stand just the sort of experience 
was going through

red headed venus

coat slipped from her marble
shoulders but she didnt seem to
care

her eyes were like shining stars

tommy 

sally  he gasped whats the
idea 

her arms linked about his neck
she drew his head down to hers
holding him tight and close as i
told you i intended to do a lot of
retrospecting i did i thought it all
out and decided i dont like stan at

continued from page 

francine supped over on the

seat next to jimmy and jim-
my- she curled her white arms
about his shoulders let her bright
head drop to his chest where her
mouth moved gently against the front
of his shirt--knowing w h a t
maizie told me i wanted you to come
with me on this trip thats why 
called you and i was hoping some-
thing would go wrong so i could
show you i am a flier and a good
one despite being a woman

  jimmy was dazed then hot with
excitement then incredulous may-
be they had cracked-up maybe he
was unconscious somewhere in a
hospital and would come to only to
find this a part of delirium he
inched himself on the arm and it
hurt he reached over and pinched a
luscious bit of francines white
flesh she jumped cried out ouch
what the hell  

  just seeing if im awake sighed
jimmy and he crushed francine
to him with a groan

  francine pressed closer to-
morrow we can be married jimmy
weve lost so much time-weve
missed so many kisses-because we
were such a stubborn pair of fools
but lets not waste any more time
-h e r voice lowered a little-
jimmy im your girl not a tramp
love me jimmy-dont ever let me
go-dont ever stop kissing me
whoever said you were a tramp
snapped jimmy indignant if i
catch anyone calling you a tramp ill
bash their brains in

  and then jimmy was holding her
close gasping with the ecstasy of it
blind with the furious beating of his
heart

continued from page 

all i wont marry him nothing can
make me why because im in
love with you-ive always been in
love but you never gave me a break
go ahead throw me out if you
want

  tommy laughed under his breath
as his lips found hers throw you
out he repeated joyfully baby
from now on youre staying oke
