diary

      january -there are times when i wish
      id been shingled before ever i met george
      or else that hed grabbed a loose lock this
      morning he swore that the ichtyosaurus egg i
      gave him was stale but what does he expect when
      its been laid about a million years  things wont
      keep for ever even in the ice age

he says he never gets anything now like his
mother used to make but id like to see myself
serving up a lump of raw frozen aurochs as she
used to the old lady knew nothing of our up-to-
date methods in the home and never cooked over
in her day

a fire in her life because fires hadnt been invented
i knew george had got up the wrong side when
my pretty ickle woolly-haired rhinoceros tried to
jump on his knee and he kicked it in the quarter-
nary period

it all commenced a month ago when i was try-
ing to invent the first xylophone and i wanted the
thigh-bone of the man next door for an a flat it
appeared to be just the length but after george
had taken one good look at the club the other fel-
low was carrying he said that he couldnt afford
it hes getting mean

                        i wept of course and he tried to comfort me
                      with a lump of old red sandstone but it didnt
                      leave a mark he doesnt love me any more

                       and to think that this is the wretch whom i
       promised to love honour and obey he was so
       nervous at the wedding that he dropped his axe
       and his hand shook so much that if i hant butted
       int oit myself i should still have been single

it was for him i filted herbert whose ancestors
follies

came over m miocene times when georges lot
were barred by the immigration authorities be-
cause theyd bitten their tails off to make them-
selves look like men but i was stunned by the
way george threw his wealth about it weighed
half-a-hundredweight

january th-the landlord called to-day must
make a note that we neednt get any food in for
the sabre-toothed tiger for a week

january rd-had my dancing lesson from
the cave-bear and learnt a new step called the

neck wriggle at least i was told it was a new
step but it seems just like the old shoulder
squirm i shall have another when that collar-
bone knits together again

   february th-what do you think trixie is
engaged she showed me the bump its a beauty
larger than the one i had she is a bit long in the
tooth and i expect when her fiance first caught
sight of her he took her for a pterodactyle and
welted her one anyhow hes compromised her
and shes safe

   she tells me shes looking forward to her hon-
eymoon trip i never said anything but i hope it
keeps fine for her it took me weeks to get rid of
the gravel rash on the back of my neck

march nd-theres a fizzy feeling in the air
to-day like boiling snow and george says its
spring i caught him chipping something on a
rock

there was a picture of a slice of melon with
clouds round it and a man pulling a ladys hair

he said it was poetry poetry-i ask you  and
it was for this he said that he was too busy to help
me beat the rushes he went very red when i
spoke about it and threw it on the floor

i picked it up and he kicked up an awful fuss

said he wasnt going to have anybody in the end

           of the cave where he works disarranging all his
           things

          but ive got no time to talk to him every-
i	things filthy theres the walls to be scraped

i 	and im going to make him knock a hole in the

          roof to let the smoke out a man came to the
follies

if

door this morning while the tiger was asleep and
i gave him a handful of georges old bones for a
little tree in a pot you ought to have heard
george when he found out

march th-i believe the dinosaurus has got
distemper it sneezed a big hole in the side of the
cave to-day but i dont mind that i never had

            enough cupboards in which to put all my things
            but it wouldnt touch its saucer of milk george
            hates it because it put its paw through the bars
            after georges plesiasaurus

               the plesiosaurus does sing a lot i tried to alter
             its loud speaker with the axe once while george
             was out but it ate the axe and cried for more

march st-george is chipping a letter on the
back of my best bedroom suite he says he is the
first man to hear the cuckoo this spring it was
really a dodo with hiccups but i dare not tell him
so

april st-been busy all day burying things
for posterity including the picture george drew
of the time he caught a fish as large as a mam-
moth but it got away from him i shudder when
i think of the artistic quality of that picture and
i feel sorry for posterity

april th -george came home to-day and told
me hed got promotion he brought it with him
its a thing you call a spear and you stick it in
things it works because george tried it on the
man who invented it i sometimes think these
modern business methods are too ruthless and
the agitators who tell us we ought to share out
everything everybody else has got are right

   after all george isnt such a bad old sort and
when he merely had a job at the bench chipping
flints he worked hard so that i dont think his
new executive post is likely to get up in his head

   when i was a girl i used to dream of having a
handsome husband i could look up to say about
seven feet high and who wouldnt chase me
round the cave in a perfunctory manner every
morning before he started for business

still george is better than nothing i must
speak to him about taking a furnished cave at the
follies

seaside this summer for the children we ought
to get possession easily enough with that  spear
as a reference the only trouble is that ive got
simply nothing to wear

  the shortage of caves is a scandal and even
the causalties in the struggle for existence dont
ase matters much its my belief the world is
overpopulated george said he had to queue up
for his turn with the corn mill yesterday society
according to him is going to the megarithiums
people are beginning to work he does nothing
but sigh for the good old times

  april th-made a great discovery to-day i
found some red earth and rubbed it on my lips
and it stayed there i rushed off to our best mir-
ror-the pond where george shoots the remnants
of his political opponents-and i look ten years
younger ill show that cat next door something

may th-my birthday and the brute never
said a word about it when i reminded him he
looked guilty and said hed been saving some-
thing for me for a long time i got it after sup-
per but i think i must be getting older these
trifles hurt more than they used to

june rd-george came home breathing very
heavily and looking very tired he said hed
stepped on a volcano but i know better i found
out afterwards that hed put three bones on what
he said was a horse it turned out to be a creature
about the size of a cat with three toes on each
foot so that im not surprised that it lost

  he wants me to make him a thing he calls a
shirt to-morrow which he can put on a dead snip
he knows of but if the snip is dead what does he
want to put a shirt on it for why doesnt he
bring it home so that we can eat it

june th-this servant problem is getting
fierce weve lost our girl again the family from
whom george got her discovered where she was
and got her back again in the usual way when
george is able to move again we shall have to look
for another

june th-took george to a mannequin show
to-day in the woods and saw some perfectly love-
follies

ly gowns furs always look best on their original
owners he grumbled as usual but finally he got
me a polecat evening frock and a beaver after-
noon gown

  september th-im getting sick to death of
the dull daily round of housework and the way
those brats of ours put their knees and elbows

through their clothes is sinful george came home
to-day with a long thin bone sharpened at one end
and with a hole in the other which he said was a
needle i dont like it its like all these labour-
saving devices it means more work for the pro-
letariat meaning me

  november rd-that hateful creature with the
red hair next door asked me to go in this after-
noon and talk to her and after id got the kids to
sleep with georges niblick i went

she also showed me a beautiful thing for cook-
ing its a skull and you fill it with water and
hold it over the fire i must get george to bring
me one home next time he meets a stranger but
the things that woman said about everybody else
made my ears flap

             november th-down at the lake to-day the
           red-haired fright next door said that we women
           ought to get up and strike a blow for ourselves

           i agree with her why should we stop at home
           and slave while the men do everything interest-
           ing

             december th-i dont know what the weath-
           er is coming to nowadays its actually so warm
           that all the ice is melting we never get a good

  two-three years ago the luck
of the irish was fast upon them
not only had sally crashed the
movies with a bang but molly
pretty and slim was an instant
success before the camel a and wan
in the big pay before you could
wink an eye

  molly was a great girl and ev-
erybody liked her - and fed her
her slimness vanished almost
overnight the studio refused to
cast her as long as she wore round-
house curves and then molly who
was fond of food began to play at

putting the

dieting and reducing finally
coming to a realization that her iiv-
ing was at stake and heeding un-
aemands of her numerous family
who needed the money molly un-
derwent a painful and utterly use-
less operation to take off the cu-
shions and particularly those that
eased her when she sat down

  molly was brave and earnest
but to this day she has been un-
able to convince producers that the
slim figure which was once her
greatest charm has been restored
so molly has been out of work  out
of a job of any kind

  then sallys luck wasnt so good
and the numerous noonans who
had gone completely hollywood
refused to slacken the pace

babies
 in holy holy hollywood

every gal in hollywood wants
to have a baby the light to
complete their womanhood talk
about it out loud too at parties-
the more gin the louder-while the
men stand around and try to look
unconcerned anyhow if youre a
gel and dont want to have a baby
you dont belong in hollywood
but how are they going to do u
-these gals time was and not
so long ago when motherhood was
the last thing of their thoughts
marriage was bad enough from a
professional viewpoint and moth-
erhood would simply wreck their
careers

  marriage appears to be the chief
drawback to the gels in the movies
who are so freely dissertating on
their desires to have babies and
to complete their womanhood
marriage in the movies is not al-

  ways so good it happens though
  sometimes openly and sometimes
  secretly and nobody can be quite
  sin e who is married in hollywood
  and who is not as a guessing
  contest it is a favorite sport

    yes marriage is the handicap
 that the movie girls must enduro
 before they can translate their
 free urge to have babies into ac-
 tion they can talk about freedom
 and their rights and are talking
 bi t it looks as though they can on-
 ly envy their sisters in other walks
 of life throughout the world who
 can defy convention and go on and
 have their babies willy-nilly

a baby and make john barrymore

once upon a time there was
an all-round sport who was
ill sick off his feed and on the
blink

  and being sick he was doubly
a rogue and into the sick room
of the old sport dropped a friend
ihe friend was of the cheerful
exceeding cheerful type his mot-
to was look on the bright side
and scatter sunshine wherever you
go so he entered the sick-cham
ber in his breezy altruistic way
and shouted why old sport
bow fine you are looking

  i dont feel that way growled
the sick man

  oh come now really i never
saw you looking so well

about it

  ill bet you five to one that my
doctor is right

  ill take it smiled the visitor
with much pain the old sport
pulled a roll of bills from under
the pillow peeled off a five and
pushed it over on a stand at the
head of the bed

  the friend laughed fished a
cart-wheel dollar out of his pants
and laid it on the five on the stand
with the medicine bottles

 ill show you you gdam
cheerful mouse-colored ass said
the sport and with that the sick
man rolled over on his right side
in three minutes he was dead -

dead as a salt mackerel but as
he gave his last gasp his lips mov-
ed as trying to say what did i
tell you and a half-smile of
triumph came to his glazed eyes
and his hand moved convulsively
toward the six dollars on the table
then all was still

  they buried him next day with
the half-smile of success still on
his face instead of a bouquet in
his hand they placed the six dol-
lars on his breast the silver dol-
lar on top of the five the under-
taker exchanged the six dollars for
a confederate ten-dollar bill just
before he screwed down the lid

  a man and his wife who lived in
ayr had a boy whom they believed
to be a mute for up to his tenth
year he had never spoken

  one day his father and he were
at work in the field and getting
thirsty they made their way to-
ward a jug of cold tea the father
took the jug and began to drink
as he gulped down the tea slowly
the thirsty boy said 

  hurry up

  whereupon the father put down
the jug in astonishment

  why he said youre talkin
why didnt ye never speak be-
fore

  naught to say replied the
child

  the new chaplain of a scotch
asylum was complimented one day
by an inmate who said we like
you better than any other chaplain
we have ever had

  im pleased to hear it said the
minister may i inquire what it
is that has made me preferred by
you above my predecessors
weel ye see replied the in-
mate we think ye mair like oor-

   one of the worst stories we have
read for a long time is as follows
jones was asked about smith

jones was asked about smith
hes a scotsman replied jones
and thats enough he was asked
how he knew smith was a scots-
man and jones said because
every time he is invited out to a
place where he knows he is going
to get a drink he eats salted pea-
nuts on the way out the story
is ridiculous who ever heard of a
scot spending a nickel for salted
peanuts 

  the other day a scot walked into
woolworths and asked a clerk
where the furniture department
was another scot was fond of his
nickels and he sqeezed one of
them so hard the indian came
through and rode on the buffalo

  a man who takes considerable
pride in the fact that he has a
way with children was passing
through a sleeping car when he
heard a child in one of the berths
wailing lustily he noticed a small
foot peeping through the curtains
and thinking to help some worried
mother pinched the toes gently one
by one and repeating the old nur-
sery rhyme

  this little pig went to market
  this little pig stayed at home
  this little pig got bread and

milk

  this little pig got none

  this little nig said-

  but he didnt finish the rhyme
an irate mother peered through
the curtains remarking that there
was one big big pig who was going
to get his face slapped if he didnt
let her foot alone
  two men in rules were discuss-
ing the relationship between
strong drink and broken homes

  no youre quite wrong said
one of them it isnt drink that
ruins so many homes

follies

a delicate commission

  an unwary youth who allows
himself to be inveigled into doing-
shopping for a lady is apt to find
his pathway beset with unsus-
pected difficulties i found that
out one afternoon when sally
begged me to do a little errand for
her down at wanamakers sally
usually does forget something
vital and the worst of it is that
she prides herself on her memory
scorns to make a list of her re-
quirements and always forgets a
most important item

  sally is my sister she is several
years older than i and inclined to
treat me like an infant-although
i graduated from harvard last
year

  we had just finished luncheon
when she began in a most ingrati-
ating tone billy darling

  i pretended not to hear

  billy darling she repeated
changing her seat to the arm of
my chair i want you to do some-
thing for me

  well what is it i asked ab-
ruptly continuing my reading of
the national bulletin

  i forgot something this morn-
ing-and i want you to get it for
me some people are coming in for
tea and ive got a heap of odds and
ends to do before then please be
a nice boy and go get it for me

  i didnt intend to go out today
-its too hot cant it wait until
tomorrow i protested

  that would be too late i must
have it for the dance tonight
send one of the maids
theyre all too busy come on
billy do be nice forget you are
my brother for once and dont be
such a selfish pig

  i kept still for a moment

  look here she bribed ill
tell you what ill do for you if youll

do this for me ill telephone the
caroll girls that well drive around
for them tonight and pick them up
on our way to the club then you
can meet estelle beforehand

  i was anxious to meet estelle 
had admired her from a discreet
distance so far she was a jolly
good sport and remarkably pretty
i had been unsuccessful in meeting
her and now that my chance had
come i felt suddenly willing to do
anything sally wanted

  as the door closed behind me i
heard her repeating one pair
open pattern ladies embroidered
- i waited to hear no more i
had already been told what to get
at least three times sally has a
habit of telling you what to get
three times and then impress upon
you what you are not to get several
times over so i was somewhat
muddled when i started out

  whew but it was hot i en-
tered wanamakers cool store
gratefully seating myself beside
a long counter whereon all sorts of
dainty lingerie was seductively dis-
played-a bit o flace a few bows of
ribbon and a little sheer silk-
scarcely more

  a lady was trying to make up
her mind between pink and beige
lingerie having at last made her
purchase she collected her change
a pomerian pup and her hand bag
and moved off now was my op-
portunity the pretty young sales
person began to fold and replace
the various articles she had taken
out for her customers selection
at length coming forward she
said with a bewitching smile any-
thing i can do for you sir

  yes i began i want a pair
of open pattern ladies embroid-
ered- i found myself talking to
air the sales girl had disappeared
follies

  a conclave of assistants seemed
to be taking place at the far end of
the counter stray phrases caught
my ear no did he really he
never what cheek floated
across to me i was in no way in-
terested

  after some minutes another
young lady approached me are
you being waited on sir she
asked sweetly

  i thought i was  replied
what i want is a pair of open pat-
tern ladies embroidered-again
i was talking to air the girl was
gone her face and neck dyed with
a blush that would have shamed
a peony

  is it a fact i heard one of the
girls say did you ever while
they threw curious glances in my
direction i began to feel embar-
rassed and most miserably self-
conscious what was wrong i
determined to find out perhaps my
necktie was crooked or my face
dust-streaked

  i felt i must see myself at any
price i did not want to be too ob-
vious about it there was a glass
just behind me and as i got up to
look i dropped my cane picking
it up i sat down across the aisle
facing the mirror i surveyed my-
self carefully-my hair was smooth
my tie was straight nothing was
undone or out of place now what
caused this apparent interest

  i again turned my attention to
the girls they kept giggling and
nudging each other saying you
go - no you go - oh i

couldnt-i havent the face-
and a lot of silly rubbish like that

  finally a rather superior young
person detached herself from the
group and came toward me with
a certain dignity she enquired
what may i do for you sir

  i repeated my request before i
had time to finish she seized a box
of goods that was lying on the
counter slammed it noisly into
place on the shelf behind her and
departed with more haste than dig-
nity

  this was absurd i was furious
i decided to report the matter to
the head of the department just
then a floorwalker came in sight i
strode up to him and demanded an
explanation of the way in which i
had been treated i have asked no
less than three of your girls what

i	want and they have left before i
finished my order

  he smiled apologetically im
sorry sir may i ask what it is
you want

  i want a pair of ladies open pat-
tern embroidered stockings

  i fear there has been a slight
misunderstanding-you see you are
in the wrong department hos-
iery he said first aisle on the
right

  never again will i be forced
duped or cajoled into doing any
intimate shopping for a lady but
it was worth it after all for sally
was as good as her word and intro-
duced me to the sweetest girl in
philadelphia that evening
