chapter i
in the case of the state of washing-
ton vs samuel smith charged with
the murder of his wife hattie
smith the prosecution has intro-
duced witnesses who swore that
  the defendant samuel smith was
violently jealous of his wife and on
numerous occasions had been heard to
threaten to kill each one of several men
whom he believed or imagined to have
paid too great attention to the said
hattie smith described as a beautiful
woman by all who knew her
  no direct evidence was adduced to
show that he had included his wife in
these threats or coupled her name with
those of the men named this infer-
ence however was skilfully presented
to the jury in the opening address of
the prosecuting attorney the latter
further strengthened this idea by his
questioning of the witnesses state-
ments were elicited from more than one
that the belief of the community was
as one expressed it that hattie smith
had better watch her step or that hus-
band of hers will kill her one of these
days during one of his fits of rage
nor had it been shown that anyone
actually had seen or heard smith
threaten or quarrel with his wife but
again the impression that he had done
so was conveyed by the questions asked
and the answers elicited by the prose-
cuting attorney who displayed great
cleverness and legal ability in his han-
dling of the case in more than one
instance he succeeded in making very
substantial mountains of solid threat out
of what were in themselves molehills
of evidence so favorable was the im-
pression he made by his masterly per-
formance of his duties that before the
case came to an end he was mentioned
as a possible candidate for the gover-
norship in the campaign then pending
  while the evidence tending to show
smiths guilt was entirely circum-
stantial it was damning in its weight
and directness in the particularity of
all those incriminating details that ham-
mer home a belief which often is fully
as strong as that supported by the testi-
mony of eye-witnesses
  to secure a conviction for murder
the law requires as a primal factor
the proof of the corpus delicti that is
the body of the offense-the fact that
a human being has been murdered
this essential fact being established
and evidence submitted sufficient to se-
cure an indictment the next step is to
connect or attempt to connect the de-
fendant with the crime proven cir-
cumstantial evidence to secure convic-
tion must exclude every other hypothe-
sis except that of guilt time place
motive and means are established or
sought to be established
  all of these requirements had been
met by the prosecuting attorney
  the evidence adduced by the state
had set up as facts the following an-
swers to these statutory demands
  as motive an unreasoning and un-
founded jealousy and suspicion leading


the prisoner speaks
to ungovernable rage beyond all re-
straint
  the opportunity and place for com-
mitting the crime without arousing an
alarm or even immediate suspicion
was provided by the fact that samuel
smith and bis wife lived in a house on
the very fringe of the outskirts of the
town of l- some distance from the
main route of travel and with the
house of the nearest neighbor fully a
quarter of a mile away
  the time as nearly as it could be de-
termined by the prosecution was some
time between the hour of  p m
of november eleventh and the hour of
 a m of november thirteenth
the first named being the hour when
the deceased was known to have been
seen alive the last time and the latter
the time when her dead body was dis-
covered
chapter ii
  the method and the proof of prob-
able circumstance may be summed up
from the evidence presented as fol-
lows 
 on the evening of november
eleventh at or about  p m
samuel smith and his wife hattie
were seen walking along the railroad
track going toward that part of town
in which they lived by several citizens
who saw and recognized them they
appeared to be in earnest conversation
while no one overheard any of the
words that passed between them
samuel smith was seen making very
violent gestures waving his hands
and arms like he was mad and mak-
ing motions as if he was hitting some-
thing at the same time hattie smith
seemed according to each of several
versions of her attitude and appear-
ance to be depressed frightened
nervous and acting like she was
crying
  no one could be found who actually
had seen either of the smiths enter
their house that evening together or
separately but the windows of the
smith residence were observed to be
lighted as late as  a m of the morn-
ing of the twelfth by a neighbor who
was up at that hour to attend to her
baby who was ill
  owing to the comparatively isolated
location of their house the smiths still
burned oil lamps one of these during
the investigation was found to be
burned dry possibly or probably on the
night of the eleventh-twelfth the
item of the lighted window therefore
had considerable or no significance as
one chose to regard it
  as far as could be ascertained no
one had seen either samuel or hattie
smith at any time on the twelfth day
of the month
  on the forenoon of the thirteenth
at half-past eleven the chairman of the
foreign missions society of st lukes
church a mrs charles gar ford who
knew mrs smith by sight but not per-
sonally called at the smith residence
for the purpose of soliciting a contribu-
tion to the missionary fund if expla-
nation of her subsequent actions is
necessary it is to be found in the
earned reputation possessed by mrs
garford for being a woman of deter-
mined purpose and persistence in the
work of solicitation for the benefit of
various and varied funds religious and
sociological educational and reforma-
tory charitable and-it was said by
the un regenerate-uncharitable when
mrs garford issued forth for the pur-
pose of collecting she collected or to
use her own words knew the reason
why
  mrs garford rang the bell of the
smith residence vigorously she never
used the apologetically light pressure of
the unsure petitioner but always the
determined and maintained push that
the prisoner speaks

demands rather than requests immedi-
ate response and admission repeated
and prolonged efforts to bring someone
to the front door failed
  thereupon mrs garford with that
rigidity of body and precision of step
that bespoke her augmented rather than
lessened intent not to accept subterfuge
as adequate means of escape proceeded
around the house to the kitchen door
which she found to be partly open ac-
cepting this as evidence that mrs smith
was at home and as confirmation of
her suspicions that the silence was on
purpose mrs garford after knock-
ing once or twice on this rear door en-
tered the kitchen
  here unwashed dishes on the sink
drainboard aroused that measure of
righteous indignation that is expressed
only by the good housekeeper-who
does not have to do her own work-
and added both suspicion and determi-
nation from the kitchen mrs gar-
ford pursued her way into the dining-
room in search of the mistress of the
house and prospective contributor to
the evangelization of the heathen of
foreign lands that she was an emis-
sary and representative of divine
providence mrs garford would have
been quick to acknowledge but that she
was personifying grim-mooded fate
would not have occurred to her
  between the dining-room and living-
room of the smith house were large
double doors of the kind known as
folding though they never are known
to perform that movement or some-
times any other despite either force or
persuasion these doors were con-
cealed as is the custom in well-
appointed houses in such towns as
l- with curtains called portieres
of heavy material and ornate design
  being convinced so beyond all doubt
or question that any idea to the con-
trary never entered her mind that both
her mission and missions justified the
invasion of another womans home to
any required limit especially when that
woman selfishly attempted to avoid the
visitation-or so one would gather from
mrs garfords statements-she was
about to draw aside these curtains and
enter the front room when the toe of
her shoe struck something that her
psychic sensibilities at once told her
she said was a human body
  mrs gartord had almost stepped
on the body of harriet smith fully
clothed lying on the floor of the living-
room with the head resting on the
small brass running-rail of the folding-
doors which were open for a space of
about nine inches just wide enough to
permit the head to lie between them
  the condition of the body especially
that of the head was such that it re-
quired only the momentary glance
which mrs garford gave it to show
that mrs smith was dead and had
been killed by someone who had
indulged in a veritable frenzy of mur-
der
  omitting the gruesome details de-
scribed by the coroners physician in his
testimony it was evident that the
weapon used had been both sharp and
heavy possibly it was at first assumed
an axe with some such weapon the
head had been cut and battered out of
all human semblance and the trunk and
limbs hacked and bruised in a score of
places either the woman put up a
strong and prolonged resistance or as
seemed far more likely the murderer
had not been content with killing his
victim but indulged his anger or hatred
to the limit of disfiguration
  the physicians expressed opinion
was that death had been practically in-
stantaneous from some one of the nu-
merous head wounds and that life had
been extinct about thirty-six hours
with the possibility that the period be-
tween the murder and the finding of
the body might have been longer or

the prisoner speaks
shorter by three or four hours either
way
chapter iii
  it was only after the house and
neighborhood had been searched re-
peatedly that the weapon which had
been used was discovered this diffi-
culty and delay had been due as in
poes purloined letter to die object
sought being concealed by its very ob-
viousness credit must be given to the
prosecuting attorney who personally
was assisting the sheriff and local po-
lice in their investigations for finding
the heavy artillery sabre it hung in
plain view above the mantelpiece of the
living-room immediately under a
crayon portrait of harriet smith even
this work df art not being able to de-
stroy her reputation for fascinating
beauty
  the prosecuting attorney had been
gazing fixedly at this portrait of the
murdered woman with an expression
on his face that might have been in-
spired by a feeling of the stern retribu-
tive justice he was called upon to en-
force or possibly only of sorrow that
such awful tragedy should snuff out the
life of so charming a woman what-
ever his personal emotion it gave way
to his official keenness of observation
when his eye fell upon the ornament
that had reverted to its original pur-
pose the destruction of human life
this reversion was not apparent how-
ever as there was nothing in its ap-
pearance as it rested in its usual place
upon the wall to indicate that it had
been disturbed since it first had been
hung from the picture molding jus-
tice may be blind but the prosecuting
attorney as her advocate was not even
to the possession it would seem of a
power of penetration not given to ordi-
nary mortals
  when the sheriff attempted to pull
the blade from its scabbard it stuck for
a moment and then came free with a
jerk it was at once apparent that the
resistance was due to the blood with
which it was thickly covered it was
evident that no attempt to remove this
had been made by the murderer he
had been either too callous or too hur-
ried to do more than return the sabre
to its scabbard and replace it upon the
wall a closer examination also dis-
closed the fact that the sword was not
as is usual dull according o army reg-
ulations but had been sharpened to a
keen cutting edge it was the marked
curve of this blade peculiar to old-style
artillery sabres that had been respon-
sible for the first assumption that the
wounds had been made with an axe
  the prosecuting attorney also was
responsible for the further discovery
in a closet on the second floor of a pair
of low canvas shoes and a pair of heavy
cotton work gloves the ownership of
these articles was acknowledged by
samuel smith the accused when con-
fronted with them during the trial all
four of these pieces of wearing apparel
had been so literally soaked with blood
that comment was made by one of the
deputy sheriffs that he must have dab-
bled them in it during the trial it
was stated by the prosecution and not
contradicted by the defense that these
had been worn by the murderer-the
rubber-soled shoes to enable him to
creep upon his victim silently the gloves
to prevent tell-tale finger marks the
failure to destroy these damning pieces
of evidence was ascribed to carelessness
and misplaced confidence upon the part
of the prisoner in being able to prove
an alibi
  nothing further was deemed neces-
sary by the officials to warrant the ar-
rest of samuel smith on the charge of
having murdered his wife this arrest
accordingly was made on the afternoon
of the fourteenth of november when
the prisoner speaks

the accused was found on the edge of
town farthest from his home but walk-
ing toward it
  when apprehended smith had not
been advised of the charge laid against
him until after he had been lodged in
jail while offering no resistance he
had earnestly protested against his ar-
rest he proclaimed both innocence
and ignorance of any crime or misde-
meanor that would justify it and de-
manded that the accusation against
him be stated immediately through
some official misunderstanding or over-
sight it was not in fact until that eve-
ning after dark that he was told the
reason for his arrest it was then that
the prosecuting attorney having dis-
covered the omission hastened to the
jail to explain in person
  stifling his natural horror of the deed
and abhorrence of the perpetrator of it
the prosecuting attorney had displayed
great consideration and humanity in
choosing his words and in his manner
of speaking when he told samuel smith
that his crime had been discovered the
body and incriminating evidence found
indeed he had been quite severely criti-
cized by a number of the townspeople
for being so mealy-mouthed in con-
fronting that molochian monster with
his heinous homicide-the quotations
being from the account published in the
weekly newspaper of l-
  the prisoner had added consider-
ably to the resentment felt against him
by his manner of receiving the news
and his attitude and actions during the
interview in jail with the prosecutor
  at first he did not seem to realize
the portent of the prosecuting attor-
neys opening remarks and the latter
said in describing the incident pre-
tended not to comprehend that his wife
was actually dead when disgusted
with the mans pretensions of ignorance
the attorney had bluntly stated the bald
fact of the mutilated condition in which
the body of harriet smith had been
found the prisoner had simulated over-
powering shock he staggered to the
cell cot on which he fell or sat with
his head in his hands he remained
in this attitude silent for over a min-
ute until the representative of the law
impatiently ordered him to cease his
mummery then he sprang to his feet
with a single sharp inarticulate ex-
clamation and would have attacked the
prosecuting attorney if it had not been
for the fortunate presence of the dep-
uty sheriff who restrained him by
force subsequent to this one outburst
smith had assumed and maintained
that attitude of cool aloofness appar-
ently almost of indifference in which
he had obstinately persisted until the
very end of the trial
  later in interviews with the police
newspaper-men and one or two privi-
leged citizens including the rector of
st lukes smith talked freely of the
affair and seemed if anything anxious
to discuss every possible detail of the
case it was as if he was an inter-
ested onlooker rather than the mortal
most vitally concerned in the murder
and the proceedings that were the out-
come of that crime
  while smith asserted his innocence
and total ignorance of every thing or
circumstance connected with the trag-
edy except as it had been told to him
he displayed what was deemed to be a
morbid if not ghoulish curiosity in
even the most minute descriptions of
every detail connected with it he
questioned and cross-questioned every-
one with whom he was allowed to talk
asking them to tell him of the discovery
of his wifes body the wounds the
weapon how it and the bloody shoes
and gloves happened to be found what
was said and by whom the exact posi-
tion of the furniture in the living-room
when mrs garford and later the of-
ficers entered the failure to observe

the prisoner speaks
 footprints on the ground outside the
 house before all chance-of identifying
 them had been obliterated by the crowd
 of human flies attracted by the smell of
 blood and the actions of everyone con-
 nected however remotely with the in-
 vestigation and his own indictment
   unlike most men in his predicament
 smith was not only willing but eager
 to talk olthe crime in all its phases and
 consequences not excepting his own
 danger of conviction and execution as
 the possible or probable last act of the
 tragedy for this freedom of speech
 and openly displayed curiosity he was
 even more severely criticized than are
 those more natural prisoners who
 take refuge in sullen silence hyena
 cold-blooded snake degenerate
 bluebeard ignoring the lack of plu-
 rality of wives and crimes and blood-
 thirsty butcher were some of the
 mildest of the epithets applied to the
 accused by the indignant residents of
 l- if not of houses of glass
   the feeling of the community which
 extended to the surrounding country-
 side ran so high against this occupant
 of the county jail which formed the
 basement of the courthouse that more
 than once lynching was suggested and
 on one occasion nearly put into effect
 on the occasion alluded to it had only
 been by the fearless observance of his
 duty in upholding the majesty and fair-
 ness of the iaw assumed in the ab-
 sence of the sheriff by the prosecuting
 attorney that the prisoner escaped sum-
 mary and extra-legal execution by the
 mob suddenly appearing before the
 jail this mob had demanded that the
 man be turned over to them with
 threats of storming the jail if any re-
 sistance was made to their entry and
 seizure of this creature who had so out-
 raged the quiet orderliness and mo-
 rality of the towns existence
   as good fortune would have it for
 the honor of the county and the im-
 partial administration of justice the
 prosecuting attorney happened to arrive
 at the jail in time to appeal to the re-
 spect for law and its orderly processes
 of those citizens assembled and
 when the mob refused to heed his ex-
 hortations to disperse accompanied by
 his solemn promise that-he would see
 that justice was done in full measure
 to follow this appeal by a threat to
 shoot the first man who attempted to
 mount the courthouse steps
  it is probable that it was more the
fear that he would carry out his threat
rather than respect for the law or con-
fidence in his promise of justice being
enforced that finally prevailed upon the
assemblage and induced them to relin-
quish their purpose the prosecuting
attorney was known to be a man who
would face any danger for the accom-
plishment of a purpose he had in mind
or to fulfil any threat or promise he
made
chapter iv
  smiths story which was received
with the sneering incredulity its weak-
ness and implausibility deserved briefly
stated was as follows 
 on the evening of november
eleventh when he had been seen walk-
ing along the railroad track with his
wife he was telling her of a fishing
trip he once hadtaken up the north
fork his gestures had been those of
explanation of how he had hooked so
large a trout that he had been forced
to use a club to finally land it his
wife he said had been neither fright-
ened nor crying as her actions had been
interpreted to indicate but on the con-
trary she had been laughing at what
she conceived to be the extravagance
and exaggeration of his account
  he had told her the story at that time
because he had arranged to start that
same evening of the eleventh for
the prisoner speaks

another fishing trip to the same part of
the river he did in fact according
to his statement leave his home less
than an hour later-that is about eight
p m-in order that he might reach
the desired location in time to start
fishing by dawn of the twelfth as he
succeeded in doing
  he fished he claimed all that day
and all diy of the thirteenth he
started home the morning of the four-
teenth reaching l- about two
p m the time he was arrested
  he accounted for his empty hands
when he returned by saying that he
had stopped fishing when he did hav-
ing intended to stay at least another
day due to the fact that while wading
waist deep in the river he had slipped
on a smooth stone fallen and lost hold
of his rod which had been carried away
by the stream the creel of fish he
already had caught his hat book of
flies and other tackle also had been lost
at the same time owing to his unex-
pected immersion he had nearly lost
his life as well by reason of the swift-
ness of the stream and the depth of the
pool into which he had stumbled
  certain dark stains on his corduroy
coat and trousers he explained by stat-
ing that they were not only months old
but hadbeen made by the blood of fish
and game under other circumstances
this might have been easily credible
since smith was known to be an ardent
sportsman but the prosecuting attor-
ney reported that having sent the gar-
ments to a chemist for examination of
the stains they were found to have
been due to human blood
  to the essentials outlined in the fore-
going resume there was added a large
number of contributory details against
smith none of these minor incidents
was incriminating in itself but taken
as a whole they added considerable
weight to the case for the state as as-
sembled and presented by the prosecut-
ing attorney they included deposi-
tions affidavits and testimony as to ac-
tions words and looks used by smith
on different occasions extending over
a period of several years previous to
the tragedy this history covered in
fact almost the entire time that smith
and his wife had lived in l- and
even reverting to their residence in
another state these details while
without direct connection with the
crime were skilfully introduced by the
prosecution to show that the accused
was a man of violent temper easily
aroused that he was of a suspicious as
well as jealous disposition that he was
prone to imagine injuries and insults
where none existed or was intended
and that he had small regard for life
animal or human
  it is true that the testimony offered
as being proof of the qualities or faults
in the character of the prisoner might
with equal reason and justice be
brought against any manof normal im-
pulses and disposition wrenched as
they were out of the context of the
years during which the alleged inci-
dents occurred it is more than prob-
able that out of the life of anyone of
us there could be taken disconnected
circumstances actions and speeches
that placed in series and bound to-
gether by implication would convict us
of being potential if not actual crim-
inals or demonstrate that we should be
placed in close confinement as hopeless-
ly insane in life as in literature con-
text often supplies the basis or the
belief of illusion created
  the only unusual feature of the trial
that made its progress especially dif-
ferent from scores or hundreds of other
trials for murder was the unique and
astonishing refusal of the accused to
accept legal counsel for the conduct of
his defense upon so serious a charge
despite the urgings of the court and
the insistence of the prosecuting attor-

the prisoner speaks
ney the latter making his protests on
the basis of his proclaimed desire that
all the rights of the defendant should
be fully conserved and safeguarded
smith insisted upon and finally suc-
ceeded in establishing his right to con-
duct his own case without aid from
anyone and so did conduct it
  this characteristic expression of
strong individuality or it may have
been belief in the righteousness of his
cause as he himself saw it was not only
the cause of widespread adverse com-
ment but also was made the occasion
by the prosecution for further ham-
mering home of the idea of the prison-
ers obstinacy and erraticism
  the prosecuting attorney as a good
lawyer did not fail to make capital of
the additional fact that the accused de-
clined to cross-examine the states wit-
nesses or call to the stand witnesses
of his own nor of the further inno-
vation of the defense also allowing the
entire case for the state to be pre-
sented to the jury without so much as
a single objection made exception
taken or comment on any of the pro-
ceedings during the days that the trial
consumed until the last
  not even during the selection of the
jury did smith avail himself of his
legal constitutional rights of examina-
tion or challenge he gave every evi-
dence of entire indifference to the per-
sonnel of the body of men who had in
their hands the decision as to his in-
nocence or guilt his freedom or his
execution with perfunctory nods or
formal expressions of acceptance he
permitted the prosecuting attorney to
practically choose his own jury dis-
playing a lack of interest in their per-
sonalities or possible prejudices that
could not have been greater had he been
no more than a mere spectator in the
courtroom
  when the prosecuting attorney closed
the case for the state with a truly mas-
terly summing up it was felt by many
who were in attendance at the trial that
the jury would render a verdict of mur-
der in the first degree without leaving
their seats or at least that they might
as well do so except for the formality
of retiring for wholly unncessary de-
liberation and casting of a ballot
chapter v
  this then was the situation when
samuel smith his manner cool his
bearing confident his voice low-pitched
but vibrant with feeling his attitude
that of deep respect for the court and
deference to the jury rose to his feet
saying
  may it please your honor fore-
man and gentlemen of the jury it has
been said that the man who pleads his
own case has a fool for a client i
presume that the converse is equally
true that the client has his equal in that
respect for a counsellor possibly long
experience in courts has proven the cor-
rectness of that opinion right or
wrong wise or foolish i have wilfully
taken whatever risk is involved in the
double disqualification for proper pres-
entation of my claims before you
  when the court offered to appoint
an attorney to defend me i declined
for several reasons i did not have
enough money to employ a good lawyer
emphatically i did not want to risk my
life with one of lesser ability how-
ever earnest and industrious any but
the best might place me in additional
jeopardy through his inexperience or
incompetence nor was i willing to
accept counsel paid by the state with
the inadequate fee allowed under such
circumstances even a good lawyer
could not feel that deep and abiding
interest which i conceive my defense
both deserves and needs not seeking
the burden in the face of the cumula-
tive evidence that has been presented
the prisoner speaks

against me and poorly paid he would
have been apt however conscientious
he might be to go through with this
trial in a perfunctory manner that
risk would be too great for me to as-
sume my circumstance is perilous
enough as it is i must avoid every
possible weakness i must compel
every element of strength
  i say this with all due respect to
his honor the court and the legal
profession which he enlightens and ad-
vances as a member and for which i
have the highest admiration and most
profound regard
  i have studied for the law myself
but possibly fortunately for any clients
i might have had i failed to pass the
necessary examination for admission to
the bar therefore if i am guilt of
technical errors in the conduct of my
defense or overstep the bounds of my
rights or propriety i trust that his
honor will bear with and correct me
in so far as his position on the bench
permits i hope also that you gentlemen
will be lenient in your judgment of my
mistakes due to ignorance other con-
sideration except that for truth and
justice i neither ask nor desire
  no one can know this case better
than i because no one else has or can
have the same vital interest in under-
standing its essentials or the signifi-
cance of its details i am not as a
lawyer would be interested in winning
it for the protection of my client my
own reputation and my earned fees i
literally am pleading for both my life
and my liberty and more i am
fighting for the vindication of my honor
and standing amongst my fellowmen
   am accused gentlemen of the jury
of a most horrible crime a crime for
which were  guilty mere hanging
would be wholly inadequate punish-
ment had i committed this abhorrent
act then the ancient rack and wheel or
tearing asunder by wild horses would
be more nearly fitting as expiation
but no expiation is possible in this
world for such a deed nothing the
law can inflict nothing that i could suf-
fer would serve to lighten the darkness
of such a crime by the depth of a
shadow
  i say this soberly and with full re-
alization of what it means should you
gentlemen believe me guilty and so
render your verdict i say to you seri-
ously that were i in your place and
believed me guilty of this crime i
would the law permitting wreak some
such terrible vengeance upon so base
and despicable a wretch as the man who
had so stained his hands and soul
  i am not guilty i thank god i can
look you in the face and say that i
am not guilty as charged and expect
to prove my innocence to you beyond
the peradventure of a doubt
  you have heard the testimony of
the witnesses for the prosecution i
am not blaming them for what they
have said i consider them honest men
and women laboring under a most aw-
ful and mistaken conception of the
truth i think they testified according
to their understanding and belief but
i know that misunderstanding to be
contrary to the facts i know that be-
lief is based on their inability to know
those facts the facts have not been
presented to them either before or dur-
ing this trial the facts have not been
laid before you gentlemen of the jury
even i do not know all of them much
as i know only one man does i
mean that he shall tell
  i shall not however cross-examine
these well-meaning but deluded wit-
nesses who have done their best and
worst to convict me f am not suf-
ficiently skilful in the ways and art of
the clever advocate to do so success-
fully i have no desire to impugn their
motives or question their intent there
is a marked distinction which i want

the prisoner speaks
to preserve between discrediting the
testimony and discrediting the witness
i shall allow their testimony to stand
without other question than that with
which i challenge the entirety of the in-
dictment against me
  you will have noticed also since
your attention has been called to it by
the learned counsellor for the state
that i took no exceptions in either the
technical legal sense or the literal to
anything that was said by any of these
witnesses or by the prosecuting attor-
ney statements have been made in the
guise of evidence that i do not think
are admissible according to legal pro-
cedure but i do not care to argue that
point or take any advantage of it the
truth shall prevail i have no intention
or desire to appeal this case to a higher
court either state or federal if you
find me guilty as charged the only
court to which i shall carry my appeal
is that higher one before which we all
must appear sooner or later to answer
for our conduct here below
  i have in fact no longer any in-
centive to live or cling to this existence
merely to die would be a welcome re-
lease from the abyss of sorrow in which
i am steeped my wife made life a
joy and a blessing without her to
share it the balance is of neither worth
nor moment but for her sake rather
than for my own i am not content to
go hence by a shameful route and
branded as a criminal
  before that higher court i shall
have no fear of a possible verdict of
guilty for there only the truth shall be
known i am not afraid of the truth
nor am i afraid of that same truth in
this court but only of its being un-
discovered or misunderstood
  i cannot know what impression has
been made upon your minds by the
testimony to which you have listened
being men of common sense and actu-
ated by emotions common to all of us
i cannot see how at this time you can
be anything but most violently preju-
diced against me everything so far
has been conceived planned and pre-
sented with the sole idea of creating
such a prejudice in your minds
  understand me clearly-i am not
criticizing or blaming the prosecuting
attorney for anything he has done or
said here in this courtroom both you
and i must presume that he is an hon-
orable man and performing his sworn
duty as he sees that duty we have
heard no word or evidence to the con-
trary he we should have every rea-
son to suppose honestly and imparti-
ally believes me guilty of the crime of
murder as charged if that were not so
he could not as an upright man and a
trusted officer of the law have brought
that charge against me if he did not
so believe in my guilt to the exclusion
of every other reasonable hypothesis
any reputable attorney any decent man
would have refused to conduct this case
on behalf and in the name of the
people whose public servant he is
  i have as i said been placed before
you in the most unfavorable light pos-
sible i have been made to appear as
a being less than human and more
brutish than the brutes i have been
painted in colors that would make a
wolf blush and a hyena hide his head
in shame that would cause a snake to
shun my society and a tiger to shudder
at my ferocity
  yet i not only hope i expect to
change all this to remove this preju-
dice now in your minds to wash away
this stain that reveals me in such loath-
some guise i intend to convince you
of my innocence and show you that i
have been most abominably and cruelly
misjudged and misnamed-whether by
accident or design remains to be seen
and i shall do this not by an array of
witnesses in rebuttal of those who al-
ready have appeared upon the stand
the prisoner speaks

but by a single one upon whose testi-
mony reluctant though it will be i shall
rest my defense nor is this witness
even a friend of mine rather he is
my dearest enemy his fondest wish
would be my undoing if to desire a
mans death were enough i should be
rotting in my grave long before this
charge had been brought against me
and you would never have been called
to the solemn duty of judging me
  your honor i respectfully pray that
randolph raggan be sworn and placed
upon the stand as a witness in this
case
chapter vi
  when the witness called by the de-
fense had been sworn and taken his
seat on the stand not without a mur-
mur of surprise and questioning com-
ment rippling over the crowd that
packed the room and after the usual
preliminary questions smith proceeded
to examine him as follows
  you are too well known mr rag-
gan to make it necessary for me to put
the usual questions regarding your
identity place of residence and occupa-
tion except for the purposes of court
record the jury is tired as we all
are and will appreciate i hope my
desire to shorten the remaining part of
their labors as much as possible to
that end i promise to be brief to limit
my questions to essential points only
and if at all possible to omit any sum-
ming up for the defense upon the com-
pletion of your examination if you
will be equally brief and to the point
in replying to my questions i do not
think that this case need take many
more minutes
  did you mr raggan know the de-
ceased harriet smith
  yes
  how well-to what degree did your
acquaintance or friendship extend
very slight a casual acquaintance
only
 you had spoken to her
 yes
 how many times
 oh once or twice possibly three or
 four at the most
 on what subject or subjects
 i cannot remember nothing more
 than the ordinary civilities of chance
 meetings
 where were these meetings 
 on the street in stores where i
 might meet anyone
 you never met talked with her
 alone 
 never
 you are positive
 absolutely
 did you ever call at the home of
 harriet smith to talk with her
 no
 or for any other purpose
 no
 have you ever been inside the
 smith residence except in your official
 capacity at the time of the investiga-
 tion of the murder of harriet smith
 no
 when and where did you last see
 the deceased
 i saw her body at the undertak-
 never mind that when did you
 last see her alive
 alive let me see i cannot say
 with any degree of certainty i do not
 recall having seen her for several weeks
 possibly a month or more prior to her
 -death
 you are sure that you did not talk
 with her at any time immediately pre-
 ceding or on the date of november
 eleventh 
 i did not
 did you at any time carry on a cor-
 respondence with the deceased harriet
 smith wife of samuel smith the de-
 fendant in this case
 no

the prisoner speaks
 did you ever receive letters from
 her
 no
 not a single letter
 no
 did you ever write letters to her
 no
 not even one
 not even one
 your eyesight is good mr rag-
 gan 
 yes reasonably so
 you do not have to use glasses to
 read
 no
 nor to distinguish and identify or-
 dinary objects at the normal distance
 for reasonably good eyesight
 no i enjoy normal vision
 i show you these notes that i have
 been making can you at this distance
 distinguish the handwriting sufficiently
 to recognize it if you were familiar with
 its individual characteristics
 what are you driving at
 never mind what i am driving at
 -just now answer my question
 please can you see this writing
 clearly 
 i suppose so-yes
 good i now show you a letter
 written in an even larger and more dis-
 tinct hand can you see the writing
 i ref- yes i can see the writing
 do you recognize it
 how do you mean recognize it
 is it the handwriting of anyone you
 know 
 possibly i cannot be sure
 are your eyes troubling you at this
 moment mr raggan 
 no what of it of course they
 are not
 i am relieved to hear that your sight
 is not suddenly impaired  that they have
 not suffered any sudden shock i
 thought-but to save time and so not
 weary the jury unduly i now step
 closer to you and hold this letter as near
to you as i can without placing it with-
in your reach now can you recognize
the handwriting-sufficiently to tell the
jury who in your opinion might have
written this letter
  it looks familiar
  how familiar whose handwrit-
ing with which you are familiar does
it resemble
  it-it looks like my own
  ah now we are progressing did
you randolph raggan write this letter
which i hold in my hand
  i dont know
  you do not know whether you wrote
a letter in a hand that looks like your
own in a hand of markedly individ-
ual characteristics such as yours
  i could not say that i did or did not
write it-not without reading it it
might be a forgery
  you are right mr raggan it might
be a forgery but it is not as i think
you will acknowledge sooner or later
to prove a forgery as to prove a mur-
der it generally is necessary to prove
a motive for the crime and i cannot
conceive of anyone having any motive
to forge the contents of this letter so
again i ask you did you write this
letter
  it isnt signed with my name
your eyesight mr raggan is truly
remarkable i have not shown you the
end of this letter purposely did not do
so and yet you are able to say that it
is not signed with your name how do
you know that it is not-supposing your
assertion is correct
  i didnt sign it
  oh so you recognize this letter
this particular and individual letter
with sufficient certainty to remember
that you refrained from signing it
nothing of the sort you are
twisting my meaning
  if i am it is without intent and i
beg your pardon but you have not
replied to my question
the prisoner speaks

  some of your questions are so
-involved that i cannot answer them
i dont know what you are driv-
ing at
  that is the second time i have
earned the same rebuke from you mr
raggan if you do not know what i
am driving it-though i think you do
only too well for your own peace of
mind-i will make it most clear very
soon meanwhile i ask you again do
you recognize this letter as having been
written by you and recall the circum-
stance with sufficient clarity to remem-
ber that you did not sign it
  i dont remember anything at all
about it
  then why did you declare without
having seen the ending that it was
without signature
   i guessed it wasnt
  on what previous knowledge did
you base that guess
   i wouldnt be such a fool as to sign
that kind of a letter
  another step ahead you wouldnt
be such a fool as to sign such a letter
as this you say how do you know
what kind of a letter it is
   i can see-i can read part of it from
here
  so we are getting on a little
more and the end of our long joiirney
should be in sight will you kindly re-
peat to the jury that portion of the
letter tliat you can read
  no
  you refuse
   of course i refuse
  why
  you have not proved that i wrote
that letter
   that is for the jury to decide not
for you or me mr raggan but if
you did not write it why should you
refuse to read it aloud-such portion or
portions as you can decipher
  it-the jury would receive a wrong
impression
  because you read it or because you
wrote it
  because they would think i wrote
it
  why should they think you wrote it
if you swear that you did not do so
you do swear that you did not write it
dont you
  no
  no what which fact is it that
vou are denying 
  both
  you deny having written the letter
and deny also that denial i am afraid
mr raggan inat the jury will fail to
understand just what you are intending
to swear to come for the sake of the
jury and brevity i will go back to first
principles and reword my question
did you randolph raggan write this
letter that i intend to offer in evidence
and which i again show you
  i refuse to answer
  on what grounds
  insufficient identification
  then it is at least possible that you
might have written this letter-other-
wise you would have no hesitancy in
denying its authorship
  anything is possible 
  you are right mr raggan though
i had thought previous to this case
that there were certain things beyond
human possibilities-such a letter as
this for instance such a sequel as fol-
lowed the writing of this letter for an-
other but i will proceed to my next
question why do you refuse to re-
peat aloud in this courtroom the part of
this letter which you are able to
read 
  because-because it would have a
tendency to incriminate and degrade
me
  the letter-or the reading of it
but-never mind i will not force the
issue i am more interested and i am
sure the gentlemen of the jury are like-
wise to have you identify the hand-

the prisoner speaks
writing of this letter as being yours
is it or is it not
i said before that it looks like mine
sufficiently like your handwriting
that if it should be a forgery as you
previously suggested it would be a very
clever one
  yes
  i see that you have your fountain
pen in your pocket mr raggan may
i look at it thank you    your
honor i offer this pen belonging to
randolph raggan in evidence   
  this pen is your personal property
mr raggan
  it is
  i now ask you if this letter in ques-
tion is or is not written in the same
color of ink-a peculiar and unusual
shade of green-as that contained in
this pen
  i suppose so something like it
   something like it is not sufficiently
definite mr raggan you do not hap-
pen to be color blind do you
  no i told you before there is noth-
ing the matter with my eyes
  thank you that is one thing i
wanted to establish then-here-i
will make several marks on the margin
of this letter using the pen that is your
property are these marks and the
body of the letter written with the same
color of ink
  yes
  it is a peculiar shade of ink isnt
it
  i dont know that it is there must
be plenty like it
  do you know of anyone who uses
the same color of ink-habitually as i
will be able to show if necessary that
you have
  no
  then if the letter is written in a
hand that is a facsimile of your own
and with ink that is the same as that
which you use and which no one else
that you know uses habitually and the
pen was a heavy stub as this belonging
to you and you recognized the contents
sufficiently to guess that you would
not be such a fool as to sign a letter of
this kind-if these are the facts which
they appear to be will you kindly tel
the jury basing your opinion on your
wealth of experience in similar cases
who could have written this letter if
you did not
  i told you i dont know anything
about it you are conducting this ex-
amination not i
  indeed i had an impression ex-
actly to the contrary as to who was
conducting this case mr raggan but
if you persist in denying all knowledge
of this letter or its author i now will
offer it in evidence and with the
courts permission read it to the jury
allowing them to decide who wrote
it   
  this letter gentlemen of the jury
reads in part as- but before i read
it i will ask the indulgence of the court
to allow me to take the stand for a few
moments that i may state under oath
how this letter came into my possession
and some of the attendant circum-
stances i am endeavoring to avoid the
calling of other witnesses though i am
prepared to do so to substantiate my
testimony if his honor so directs   
i would request your honor that
randolph raggan be instructed not to
leave this courtroom as i shall recall
him to the stand when i have made my
statement regarding this letter   
  this letter was handed to me by
mrs charles garford she has made
affidavit that she found it on the floor
of the living-room of my home at the
time she discovered the body of my
wife that it was partly hidden by the
dress of the deceased and that she
mrs garford thought the deceased had
it in her hand when she was killed
mrs garford asserts that she had al-
lowed her curiosity to overcome her dis-


the prisoner speaks

cretion to such an extent that she
carried the letter home with her and
read it and then was too frightened at
first to bring it to the attention of the
authorities as she should have done as
from my standpoint it is very fortu-
nate that she did not do
   viewing her action from the strictly
technical point of the law there can be
of course no excuse for this suppres-
sion of vitally important evidence on the
part of mrs garford but for the
ultimate ends of justice she could not
have done better she should not have
taken the letter in the first place hav-
ing taken and read it she should have
as a matter of duty and right turned
it over to the prosecuting attorney
but again i repeat that her technical
error in act and judgment was pos-
sibly the result of that divine guidance
upon which the just administration of
the law so often must depend god
moves in a mysterious way his wonders
to perform
  when i was arrested and indicted
for the murder of my wife-the wife
whom i loved and love more than i do
my hopes for present or future salva-
tion-mrs garford was moved by her
conscience she told me to go to the
rector of her church and to him confess
what she both had done and refrained
from doing
   again i will state that if necessary
i will have both mrs garford and the
reverend mr sweyd come upon this
stand and repeat under oath in their
own words the facts that i now am
stating as these two persons told them
to me
  moved by his advice mrs garford
consented to visit me in the county jail
in company with the rector there
mrs garford told me her story and
rightly or wrongly gave me this letter
which i have retained in my possession
ever since mrs garford recognized
the handwriting knew the author as
   b	m-dec-
did the reverend mr sweyd because
they were intimately acquainted with
both the man who wrote this letter
was-is-one of the vestrymen of st
lukes church and in that capacity had
written many times to each of them
without failing those times to sign his
letters
  i now will read this letter which
though without signature as correctly
stated by mr raggan is directed on
this envelope which contained it to
mrs harriet smith there is no
other address given simply the name
mrs harriet smith the woman who
was so brutally murdered my wife
  it is probable though that can be
only pure supposition that it was de-
livered by hand either that of the one
who wrote it or a messenger of his i
have not been able to discover who car-
ried it on its fateful mission that it
was written sent and received is
enough enough to prevent the guilty
man from escaping the consequences of
this and his subsequent acts a grave
lapse from his habitual caution one of
those errors which even the keenest
minds make-to their undoing
  i also will state under oath your
honor and gentlemen of the jury that
i have positive knowledge of the fact
that this letter while the last was by
no means the first written to my wife
by the same man it was in fact only
one of many that i saw with my own
eyes in the possession of my wife
  great stress has been laid in this
trial upon what has been called my
ungovernable temper and my threats
to do great bodily harm to kill men
who i conceived to be paying unwel-
come attentions to my wife in so far
as that refers to one man it is true i
did threaten to kill him if he continued
his insulting persecution that man
was randolph raggan had i seen this
last letter before i left town on the
night of the eleventh of november it

the prisoner speaks
is possible even probable that i now
would be undergoing trial for his mur-
der instead of for the murder of the
woman he so vilely wronged in thought
and act
  it has been alleged that the fishing
trip which i took was a subterfuge a
blind in one sense it was i had
brooded over the letters received by my
wife from this man until my temper
was getting beyond my control i went
away ostensibly to fish but really to
wrestle with myself-to have a quiet
place in which to take stock of myself
and the situation to decide upon what i
should do	
  consider gentlemen the conflicting
emotions that you would have felt had
you been in my place it is a serious
matter to deliberately ponder the killing
of a man sometimes as in this in-
stance not because of the man nor
because of yourself or the penalty you
may suffer but because of the effect on
innocent others i will not inflict upon
you the wearisome rounds of the con-
flict i fought with myself the countless
pros and cons of the silent argument
there in the woods by the river a soul
in torment is not a sight for the eyes
of others enough that i won the
battle that i started back home deter-
mined to find some other means short
of killing to put an end to the persecu-
tions of randolph raggan
  i knew and know that my wife was
a good woman pure-minded almost to
the point of innocence more faithful to
me and my interests than i could be
myself she bitterly resented the ap-
proaches of this man his attempts to
supplant me in her affections but even
i was not able to appreciate the full
worth and strength of harriet smiths
nobility and purity-qualities which
gentlemen cost her her life a price
which i am sure she paid willingly
rather the one with which she could
have bought her safety
  i might dwell upon this theme for
hours contrasting the whiteness of the
woman with the blackness of the man
-but i must hasten to my conclusion
trusting to your own sentiments for
that understanding which any words of
mine would fail to convey
  i imagine gentlemen of the jury
that knowing i was to be out of town
for several days-and i have reason
for my belief that he did know it-this
man went to my house with the hope
and intention of accomplishing one of
of two things-or both the final ac-
complishment of his evil desires and-
or-the recovery of the letters which
he had written to my wife and which
he knew she had kept
  in the latter purpose he succeeded
partially but not entirely not en-
tirely because by some intervention of
providential justice he overlooked or
was prevented by some means from se-
curing this one and the most important
of all those letters i say the most
important i had read the others be-
fore i left home they contained no
threats this one undoubtedly was de-
livered the evening of the eleventh and
that delivery closely followed by the
writer in person no one now alive
except the man himself can know all
the circumstances that preceded and
took place during that clandestine call
but that he murdered my wife
arranged the evidence that he planned
would convict me of his own crime
and has done everything in his power
since then to sacrifice my life on the
same satanic altar upon which he slew
her-of this i am as sure as if i had
been his shadow
  this then gentlemen of the jury
is the letter in which randolph raggan
has written his own indictment in ad-
vance of his final crime
   most beautiful of women-it be-
gins and that is the only worthy state-
ment in it-i have learned that s is
the prisoner speaks

to be away on a fishing trip for several
days when such an opportunity is
offered us why throw it away need-
lessly for the sake of the idle conven-
tions of a society to which you are
superior and which i despise you
cannot doubt my overpowering love for
you my passionate devotion beside
which that of s is cold pale and per-
functory to such a woman as you
my queen a husband is a drag and a
worse than useless incumbrance you
deserve a lover with the fire that i
bring to the altar of your worship   
there is much more in this same
strain gentlemen but with your per-
mission and since you will have the
opportunity of reading it for your-
selves it is with relief that i will skip
to that portion of the letter where the
passion is of a different though no
more lovely kind the concluding
paragraph reads
   i have reason to believe that you
have not destroyed my previous letters
to you according to my request and in-
structions when i call this evening i
warn you that unless you return them
to me or allow me to destroy them then
and there i will take whatever meas-
ures are necessary you might as well
be a good girl and make up your mind
not to cause me any trouble in getting
either of the things i want and am
coming after i am in the habit of
having my own way and this time i
mean to do so at any cost so be pre-
pared tonight i am going to take the
best thing in this world-or you are
going to get the worst
  i now ask your honor that the
previous witness the only one except
myself that i have called to testify in
my defense be recalled-

there are thousands of tons
of gold locked up in gods
eternal mountains which men
will never see nor spend but
that fact doesnt keep them from try-
ing there is something about yel-
low metal which turns heads
transforms morals and grows devils
in the soil of saints merely an in-
stance of this is the case of the
hectopus mine with which i as a
post office inspector was well ac-
quainted for the space of a month
  i had been called into the case on a
complaint made by jedidiah quinot
of boston an esteemed gentleman of
his community who shed real tears
nearly wore out his glasses in polish-
ings and blew his nose prodigiously
as he told me the story of his sus-
picions concerning his harum-scarum
nephew-one herbert cryder whom
he feared had not only hopelessly in-
volved himself but disgraced the
family in a gold mine speculation
  after i had called upon cryder a
few days later i did not blame the
old gentleman for his suspicions if
there ever was an outfit which bore
all the marks of a fraud it was this
hectopus mine concern as usual it
was quartered in the most expensive
office building in the city and the boss
himself was twice as hard to see as
the president of the united states
inside the usual railing with a boy at
the gate were a dozen stenographers
copying names out of telephone di-
rectories or pages out of books-
anything to keep them busy
  in a room opening off that was
dick garrity one of the shrewdest
mine swindlers in america with his
name brazenly on the door and the
title of general manager in the
front office-when i finally got there
-was the most impressive and ex-
pensive set of mahogany office
furniture i have ever seen and behind
the big desk in the center of the room
a clean-cut chap of about thirty
bronzed smiling devil-may-care and
a most disarming way of waving a
visitor to a chair and forcing him to
take two cigars at once
  and this was herbert cryder a
disgrace to his family a worry to his
old friends suspected by the govern-
ment of being a thief facing the
world and atlanta prison not only
with a smile but with a laugh that
refused to stay bottled
  i had met many crooks but this
was a new type so new that i am
afraid i made a poor job of my role
as a prospective investor as to that
i do not know to this day whether
he really suspected my errand or
whether it was only a part of his
plan when he laughed at my proposal
to invest a few thousand dollars in
the stock of the hectopus mining and
exploration co slapped me on the
back and literally pushed me out into
the hall with a third cigar clutched in
my hand
  whatever he thought he had left
me no recourse but to go back to old
jedidiah with such information as i
had been able to pick up on the out-
side and the two of us spent the
evening going over the cards we held


ananias ltd
in our hands and speculating on what
the young scapegrace held in his
  that he was the most brazen young
swindler outside a penitentiary i was
convinced jedidiah did not have to
tell me that those girls in his outer
office-twelve of them busy when
there was not work enough for two-
were the plainest sort of bait for
the unwary dick garrity i knew
would be lost with an honest con-
cern  he knew so much about mining
that he wouldnt accept a gold piece
in change at a bank then that ma-
hogany office it was far too gorgeous
to be true and as a crowning piece
of effrontery on the wall just behind
cryders chair was a picture-a paint-
ing at that-of an indian spearing a
fish from a little platform above a
raging torrent i had not noticed
what kind of fish it was but to me
it looked like a sucker and i gasped
almost aloud as i grasped the daring
nerve of the laughing man who had
placed it there
  herbert cryder i had found out
came of one of the best families in
new england mixed in his blood
somewhere must have been a strong
element of the old-time whalers or
sea captains of some sort because
even as a boy he had been a daring
adventurous young devil the more
conservative expressed the opinion
that it was gods mercy that his
parents were dead and even those
who were still on good terms with
him socially threw up their hands
when his name was mentioned in
casual conversation
 old jedidiah had told me the
young man had a long police record
and i wasted a whole day before i
found out that this consisted of a
score of arrests for crimes ranging
from the theft of a barbers striped
pole to an unproved charge of driv-
ing an automobile while intoxicated
i must have shown my disgust at such
evidence because quinot went to great
pains to explain to me that his
nephew was such a skilful liar that
it had been impossible to convict him
of numerous grave offenses of which
he had undoubtedly been guilty but
i could not pin him down to just
what these were
  young cryder it seemed ac-
cording to jedidiah was absolutely
untrustworthy where facts were con-
cerned and a lover of mischief to such
an extent that serious trouble had
always been predicted for him
  why do you know said the old
man that scapegrace disappeared
two years or so ago for six months
and came back with a most remark-
able tale about elephant shooting in
east africa at my own expense i
cabled to nairobi and found he had
never been there then what did he
do he produced two of the finest
elephant tusks you ever saw and the
foot of one of the beasts mounted as a
humidor furthermore he had the
impudence to present the humidor to
me-to me who had exposed him
there it is on the mantel in my
own clufy he met and talked for two
hours with a man who had spent
years in east africa without making
a single slip
  maybe he was there i ventured
  he certainly was not jedidiah
replied with some heat after i
had been laughed at to such an ex-
tent that i did not dare visit my club
i	investigated still further he had
spent those six months in paris he
bought the elephant trophies by cable
in london after i had questioned his
story and he spent a month reading
every book on africa and elephant
hunting he could find
  he isnt any mere fibber mr
guernsey when he sets out to tell
a lie he makes a thorough job of it

  with the picture of that wonderful
office fresh in my mind i was of the
opinion that there was much strength
in jedidiahs opinion
  the hectopus mining and ex-
ploration co it seemed was in
somewhat the same category as the
elephant trophies the story of the
mine had followed another of the
young mans more or less regular
but mysterious absences this time
he had not told where he had been
but lent an air of mystery to his re-
cent experiences for three or four
weeks after his reappearance at home
he had gone about clad in laced boots
and wearing a tourist-style stetson
khaki riding breeches and a norfolk
jacket his face was bronzed his
hands calloused and he had cultivated
a drawl that might have been ac-
quired in georgia arizona or the
blue ridge mountains to all in-
quiries as to where he had been he
had replied by placing a finger to his
lips glancing furtively about and
whispering the one word-gold
  according to quinot his nephew
had followed up this bit of play-
acting with a lie as elaborate as the
elephant story but with this differ-
ence-he had commercialized his men-
dacity in the case of the elephant
he had reached his climax by the gift
of the humidor trophy to his indig-
nant uncle in the present episode he
had gone to the length of selling for
money stock in a gold mine which did
not exist
  why had been about the third
question i asked when i started the
investigation
  the answer was simple enough
herbert cryder was broke one
cannot go on forever playing prac-
tical jokes which involve such ex-
penses as a pair of elephant tusks
and the like indefinitely unless one is
a multimillionare and this our
young friend was not he had in-
herited about  from his father
and apparently started out to spend
it on a million dollar scale just be-
fore he vanished on the trip that
preceded the gold mine story he was
known to be playing heavily in the
market and the result had evidently
been disastrous he had admitted as
much-talked about it quite openly
in fact-and the news was common
gossip
  there was a further motive which
jedidiah explained to me at length
and which sounded perfectly logical
after i had induced him to talk he
did not want to tell me anything about
it at first saying it was purely a fam-
ily matter
  it seemed that cryder was in line
for another fortune-a big one this
time amounting to about three-
quarters of a million this was the
estate of a childless old uncle ofl
whom he had once been the favorite
but in whose black book his esca-
pades had enrolled him time and
again if cryder could tide matters
over until the death of this uncle
quinot demonstrated and at the same
time appear to have settled down as a
solid business man he would be fixed
for life it all sounded simple enough
to me the old uncle was apparently
already on his death bed with stocks
of the hectopus in his vaults and all
cryder had to guard against was a
speedy exposure
ii
 to those of us who knew these
facts it was plain that behind his
laughing mask young cryder was
nothing less than a desperate adven-
turer staking his wits and his nerve
against time and fate in a game for
the fortune of old ezekiel cryder
it had been about a year i learned

ananias ltd
since cryder had appeared at home
in his wild west outfit and mysteri-
ously whispered about gold at first
his friends had merely laughed among
themselves at what they called
herbs latest but finally cryder
had begun to scatter a few nuggets
around as souvenir gifts in the form
of scarf pins cuff links and one thing
and another and he even tried to pay
for a round of drinks out of a poke
of gold dust raised quite a row it
seems because they didnt have gold
scales at the cashiers desk to weigh
it like they do in a new mining camp
  pretty soon his friends were de-
manding to buy shares in the mine
cryder had laughed at them just like
he laughed at me but they kept at
him and persuaded him-as they
thought-to form a company and is-
sue stock he sold it cheap enough-
ten dollars for a  share-but ap-
parently he had sold quite a lot-
nobody knew then just how much
  he had pretended that he wanted
to keep it a close corporation-so
that he could have full control him-
self he said-and wouldnt sell to
anyone except close friends and rela-
tives old ezekiel bought quite a
block and even jedidiah bought some
he had an honest young lawyer as
general counsel and almost at the
start declared a dividend of ten per
cent
  the stock certificates were beauti-
fully engraved and the prospectus
was a work of art i read it through
three times before i discovered that
it was all generalities and that no-
where in it was the mine definitely
located it was- some place that the
book described as the el dorado of
the munificent west and thats no
place to buy a railroad ticket to
  it was after the dividend that he
hired garrity and the ten extra
stenographers and opened the ma-
hogany offices several of his friends
got pinched in the market about that
time and sold their stock to stran-
gers these began calling for infor-
mation and reports and things and
young cryder did not laugh as much
as he used to folks said something
was really worrying him in another
week jedidiah quinot among others
became suspicious and he would have
carried the tale to old ezekiel had
not the physicians forbidden him to
see the sick man as a result of this
he had appealed to the department
and i was put on the case
  of course i could have gone
straight to cryder showed my cre-
dentials and demanded his books the
location of the mine and all the rest
of the information i wanted but
cryder was supposedly a citizen of
some importance in that community
-no common crook-and besides that
there kept buzzing in the back of
my mind a lingering suspicion of
jedidiah quinot the chief complain-
ant in the case while he seemed to
be all broken up over the matter
nevertheless i had found out that in
case old ezekiel cryder disinherited
his nephew his fortune would go to
quinots son
  so instead of declaring myself to
herbert cryder i called on his gen-
eral manager mr richard garrity
dick was not exactly pleased to see
me when i ran across him in the lobby
of his hotel but he was quite willing
to renew our acquaintance and talk
at length garrity had been wonder-
ing for some time why i did not send
him to the penitentiary and seemed
to think it was because i had use for
him outside the fact was t did not
have the evidence but he thought i
had and i was willing to let him hold
that belief it certainly helped in
this case
  wheres the mine echoed gar-
ananias ltd

rity in response to my first pointed
question there isnt any mine i
dont sabe the game myself and i
dont ask too many questions but i
know that why i wrote that pros-
pectus myself and its a dandy if i do
say it im drawing down good money
as a coach for the young man because
hes never even seen a gold mine out-
side of that he dont need any help from
me why guernsey this cryder is
such a magnificent liar that he makes
me ashamed of myself sometimes
when hes talking for effect i can
just see that old hectopus mine with
men shoveling out gold big moun-
tains all around and the thriving
city thats springing up there in the
wilderness honest it is a pretty
picture that forms while hes talk-
ing
  but the samples i asked
where does he get his samples-his
nuggets and gold dust and so on
  oh those things garrity an-
swered with a laugh wrhy he
bought those nugget pins and cuff
buttons in seattle theyre quite
common out there-made out of alas-
kan gold i bought the gold dust
right here in town and to make it
look proper i sent west for some
black sand that the gold is usually
found in a placer diggings thats
easy enough to find but there isnt
usually more than a trace of gold in
it all i did was mix some dust and
small nuggets in with the sand and
we had the raw product fresh from
the hectopus as cryder says
  its been funny guernsey he
concluded its been good fun and
good pay too but i suppose its all
over now say isnt there any chance
to save the young fellow from going
to the pen hes a helluva good
scout
  garrity really seemed to be in
earnest about this end of the matter
and i was puzzled sentiment was a
new quality in dick
  but whv did he do it i asked
whats behind it all
  broke they say said garrity
but damned if i know really what
it is all about he seems to have
plenty of money that dividend was
his own idea and he paid t out over
 in cash on it without turning
a hair for a guy whos broke hes
about the nerviest gambler ive
ever struck because we did not need
to pay that dividend a-tall i just
want to show them how good this
mine really is he says to me with
a twinkle in his eye and all i could
do was just set there and stare at him
with my mouth open
 why if this was ray deal
guernsey and i had this guy for a
dummy president i could clean up
a hundred thousand here in a month
and beat it for russia or bones airs
or some place where even you
coulcmt get me but this cryder
fellow-why he seems to get all het
up every time anybody tries to buy
some stock and spends more time tell-
ing the suckers hes already landed
what a great mine it is than he does
figuring out where the money for the
next dividend is coming from
  is he going to pay another i
asked startled for this was news to
me
  he sure is its already announced
for october-thats six weeks from
now and i happen to know that there
isnt money enough in our account to
more than half meet it
  then you-think- i ventured
  look here guernsey said gar-
rity reaching over and laying his
hand on my knee tjje come clean
on this and ill go further i know
some other things that youd like
to know-things that would help you
a lot in washington isnt there some

ananias ltd
chance for cryder cant we make
him see that hes in over his head and
get a settlement before its too late
i cant-i just cant see that boy go
over the road
  there it was again-dick garrity
with sentiment in his soul-the un-
known quantity heretofore in that old
swindler herbert cryder i decided
must be a regular fellow and with the
determination to visit him in the
morning in my proper guise i went
to bed
 but in the morning cryder had
disappeared garrity was waiting for
me white of face at the foot of the
elevator shaft with the news he
had found a note on his desk he said
instructing him to keep the office open
as usual and inclosing a check for
 for expenses while he was
gone
  where did he say he was going
i demanded
  garrity sighed as he produced the
note
  to visit the mine he said and
added plaintively do you suppose
the boys lost his mind entirely you
know and i know guernsey theres
no more hectopus mine than that elm
over there in the park is a plum
tree
ill
  i was rather glad of the change
the new development gave me a
chance to get out into the open
trailing men across wide stretches
always was more in my line than
trailing plots through the pages of
ledgers and letter files dick helped
me both because he was afraid of
me and anxious to save his boss from
something he could not understand-
and before noon i was aboard a train
and speeding for montreal
no i did not have any thought
that he had fled to canada to escape
from me he had no idea who i was
and also canada is no safe refuge for
evil-doing americans maybe it was
once but not in my time i had no
notion why he had gone there except
a suspicion that he might have a
confederate on the other side of the
border who would provide the funds
for the october dividend
  but that wasnt it cryder stayed
in montreal just long enough to catch
the limited for the west coast the
news of that rather staggered me and
i missed the next train after him rais-
ing money enough to follow you
know we are not supposed to go out-
side the united states without a lot
of red tape being unwound but this
cryder fellow had sort of got my
goat and i borrowed some coin from
some canadian officers i knew and
went ahead with just a few cards of
introduction from them instead of
new credentials from washington
we have to do that occasionally if
we make good we are praised if we
get into a jam we get fired
  cryder was an easy man to follow
on this trip and i had plenty of
leisure to enjoy my journey across
the continent i dont mean that the
young fellow was leaving any broad
trail of empty bottles and twenty dol-
lar tips along the right of way of the
canadian pacific but he was making
himself known to every one he met
and his scintillating personality was
one to be remembered all along i
found that he had talked nothing but
mines and mining and that he had
made a trip up into edmonton to look
into the fort norman reports of gold
and oil along the mackenzie
  i almost missed him there and had
to double back from banff before i
picked up his trail i lost it again
after i passed field b c on my
second dash for the coast and had to
ananias ltd

come back-carefully this time-be-
fore i found he had left the main
highway at a little town called hope
perched between the mountains and
the fraser river canyon and struck
off into the hills
  there is still gold along the fraser
on the sand bars that ridge the rush-
ing torrent every half mile or so
chinamen can still be seen washing
the sands of the river and turning
color with almost every pan but
the best of them average only about
two dollars a day and white men
merely laugh as they pass them by
it doesnt pay for grub hardship and
loneliness but this was a great
country once back in the s hope
was a great outfitting point for a
stampede of americans who had
failed to find fortunes at the first few
turns of a shovel in the california
rush and chased the rainbow a thou-
sand miles northward rather than re-
turn east empty handed
  there certainly is gold in the 
fraser everyone could see that
but the tossing heaving rushing wa-
ters knew nothing of its value only
on the sandbars could it be found
and the rambunctious river tore these
down over night and erected new
ones every morning every miner
knows that gold in rivers is washed
down from the hills and for seventy
years prospectors have been seeking
the mother lode of the fraser de-
posits
  ten thousand hopeful men have
crossed the hills from hope to seek
this treasure house of nature her-
bert cryder i soon found out had
been the ten-thousand-and-first
  there was no concealment about
his journey he was easier to fol-
low than a new yellow freight car
the guides who had taken him into
the hills were already back in hope
when i arrived there and perfectly
willing to repeat their thirty-six hour
journey with no questions asked in
fact they volunteered the information
that cryder had bought an aban-
boned claim without even looking at
it and taken a crew of six men-fully
equipped with grub and tools for
placer work in with him the head
man of the pack train tapped his fore-
head and winked solemnly as he told
me about it but beyond that he was
non-communjcative as for me i
walked down to the river and looked
at the waters as they rushed through
the canyon on their way to the sea
the snow-capped mountains from
which the flood had tumbled and the
ruined little town which still clung to
its post between the railroad and the
torrent and pinched myself to retain
the idea that i was an officer of the
united states government in pursuit
of a criminal
  they had told me there was but
one trail across the hills to cryders
claim but apparently they did not
know cryder because when we ar-
rived at his camp he was not there
gone back to the fraser to spear
salmon a disgusted irish laborer in-
formed me as he took a fresh grip on
his shovel
  it was dusk then and i was tired
out from unaccustomed pony travel
over the rough trail i was glad
enough to accept the foremans offer
of supper and a bed in his tent and
put off any further investigation until
morning tired as i was the fore-
man and i talked together well into
the night and long after he had begun
snoring i lay awake thinking over the
things he had told me i could not
believe them as nearly as i dared
i had called the man a liar and ac-
cused him of being in league with
cryder he had refused to talk at all
until i had shown him my american
credentials-worthless in british co-

ananias ltd
lumbia but he did not know that
then i found myself facing again
that strange loyalty and sentimental-
ity in this rough mine-workman that
i had found in dick garrity soft-
palmed swindler
  could cryders swindle be as far-
reaching as this i wondered could
he possibly have enlisted and coached
this man in three days and then bra-
zenly left him here alone i knew
that cryder had never been in the
district before i knew that mcguire
the foreman was a native of hope
i knew that all cryder had done in
the camp was to take a few snap-
shots after the men he had brought
in had started digging and put up
a sign he had had painted in hope
the sign was non-committal it was
merely a white board with black let-
tering planted against the face of a
huge cliff hectopus mine was all
it said
  two days later i was again walk-
ing the brink of the fraser river
canyon i was waiting for cryder-
reported somewhere in the neighbor-
hood-and for a train a hundred
feet below me the same river boiled
and swirled it might have been the
same water i had first seen turning
a corner and returning so eternal was
the tumult it seemed as though the
fraser were composed of liquid hills
and valleys so firmly did the cur-
rents force the water into fantastic
moulds
  turning a bend in the stream in a
longer cast for views i finally came
upon a spectacle that was strangely
familiar far down below me was a
tiny platform made of driftwood on
driftwood piles and upon it perched
an indian with a long spear his
lance darted once into the tumbling
water and was withdrawn with a
huge fish squirming on its point a
salmon i knew and with the knowl-
edge came recollection this was a
picture almost the same as the paint-
ing over cryders desk i had
wronged the man from the start not
suckers but game fish that was his
ideal
  even as i looked another figure
clambered to the little platform-
cryder himself i could see the in-
dian shake his head and motion him
back with his hand but cryder
climbed on and strode out upon the
platform it showed he was new to
the country the little perch was
safe enough for the indian but
under the second mans two hun-
dred pounds it buckled swayed col-
lapsed and both were thrown into
the torrent fifty yards above
me
  i have said that i knew at the start
that cryder was no ordinary crook
i have told about the strange senti-
mentality of garrity and mcguire i
have said nothing about my own feel-
ings i doubt if i had analyzed them
myself but i held my breath as i
saw him fall and almost before i
knew it had peeled my coat and
plunged into the fraser after him i
am a rather strong swimmer or i
would not be alive to tell this today
the indian helped me a little at first
but cryder had got a bump  the
head and was a drag on both of us
next minute the indian was crashed
against a rock and only managed to
struggle ashore i finally landed
cryder a mile down the canyon
where the current rather than i
washed us on a sandbar where a
chinaman was stolidly panning out
gold
  from some place the chink pro-
duced a bottle of alcohol or gin i
dont know which and finally cryder
opened his eyes he did not remem-
ber ever having seen me before and
was a little woozy i suppose
i
ananias ltd	
 how do you feel cryder i
asked
  you know my name he asked
who are you 
  guernseys my name i said
united states post office in-
spector
 what are you doing way up
here
  ive been following you for a
month or so
  cryder sighed and closed his eyes
again
  oh hell he said -finally all
that fuss ill pay out all right
theres two hundred thousand in the
bank im not broke i made a for-
tune in that stock deal and told every-
body i was broke please let me go
on with it i must get back with
these pictures of the mine and drive
old jedidiah out of hi club again
itll only cost me about twenty thou-
sand more and its well worth it ive
spent so much time on it and its
such a grand yarn
  i shook him by the shoulder
  but its not like you to deceive
people in this manner i shouted in
his ear
  dont you worry about that he
answered jedidiah is only waiting
to steal the pennies off uncle
zekes eyes  just wanted to get that
old double-crosser so good he
wouldnt dare hold his head up i
wanted to show everybody who was
the better business man-me or him
i guess ive done it ive done some-
thing nobody ever did before ive
sold stock in a mine that never ex-
isted paid dividends on it made them
want to emigrate out here and now
ive provided them with a spot to
emigrate to the big joke will come
when jedidiah gets out here and tries
to find the gold
  i thought he had fainted in earnest
when his voice trailed off in a whisper
at the close but he rallied again and
opened his eyes with a faint but
whimsical smile
  cryder i shouted there is gold
in the hectopus mcguire has found
a pocket that is worth a quarter of a
million dollars if it is worth a cent
do you hear me 
  the smile on his face broadened
then was replaced by a frown
  hell he muttered all that time
wasted and it was such a perfectly
beautiful lie

for moriarity it had been almost
as hard to walk from the con-
demned cell to freedom by way
of the main entrance as it would
have been to take that other walk
through the little door that leads to the
electric chair he had suffered all that
a man can suffer who faces a horrid
death the last of a once iron nerve
had been put into the task of dressing
himself in his execution garments and
when the order for a new trial had
been read to him the once powerful
gang leader had silently crumpled in a
heap on the floor
  he was all in-through-done for as
surely as the electric chair could have
finished him never again would he
be able to hold a gun in his hand to
take his place as the undisputed king
of his world they would not let him
he might try it but he knew they would
find him out
  no man could hold his position he
told himself time after time who had
been through what he had endured
try as he did to hide it he knew that
his old slaves and subjects had seen
him tremble during the ridiculously
easy second trial of his case even the
assurances of his lawyers that it was
all fixed that his acquittal was a
sure thing could not sustain him he
could not keep his hands from shaking
and the muscles of his face from work-
ing the brazen effrontery of his
stare the menace of his squared
shoulders was gone he had stam-
mered as he told his prepared lie on
the witness stand and he knew that his
old henchmen were shaking their heads

behind his back as they accompanied
him in a sort of damp jubilation from
the courtroom and back to the old
rendezvous

formal argot surrendered his place as
regent and formally handed him his old
pistol as a token of renewed leader-
ship of the gang leader why he
knew and they knew and he knew they
knew he knew that he was not fit to be
even an apprentice in that company of
blood and steel every night for a
week after that he could see in the dark-
ness above his bed the sneer in
the smile on hardys face as he
surrendered the leadership which he
had already found so sweet sur-
rendered it no wonder jeff had
sneered at the very idea
  moriarity had been a real leader of
men guided into the realms of some
great manufacturing enterprise politics
or finance he would have been as great
as he had become in the world of vio-
lence and crime instead of the master
of the men who work in steel or coal
or gold fate had decreed that he should
become the master of men who deal in
crime and just as disaster overtakes
great leaders in great industry so had
disaster overtaken him on the night
when sailor bradley had dared dis-
pute his pre-eminence and met the death
the code demanded
  no one in the underworld doubted
who had killed bradley moriarity was
alive the next morning and bradley was
dead that was evidence enough but
the weeping killer

there was considerable surprise when
the leader of the woodchucks was
sentenced to death for murder every
resource was assembled to prevent his
execution and obtain his freedom and
these weapons had triumphed they
had brought back their leader but found
they had only a weakling in his stead
  why there had been tears in his eyes
when the verdict of his acquittal was
read in court twice he had been seen
faltering in his step as he came
from the loft building in which
the woodchucks had their clubroom
he started at the slightest sound of
anything like a pistol shot and-worst
of all-he refused to carry a gun
  that was the situation during two
weeks following the old leaders return
then on a sunday morning terence
moriarity bright-eyed square of shoul-
der spring in his step and a smile
on his face had gleefully pummeled
two new members of the gang who ac-
cidentally blocked his path hurled a
bottle through a clubroom window and
undisputedly resumed his sway
  the night before as all of the world
that mattered to him well knew jeff
hardy had screamed moriaritys name
as he died and the old leader had auto-
matically been crowned anew
  it did not matter so much to the
woodchucks how hardy had died
that was a matter for the police to find
out the police did-to their own satis-
faction at least-but moriarity merely
smiled at the sensation their theories
caused he still refused to carry a gun
but he still led the woodchucks
more feared and respected than he ever
was and with confidence that his path
of glory need not lead a man of intel-
ligence again to the death house
  jeff hardys body had been found at
the bottom of the elevator shaft in the
old loft building in which his gang oc-
cupied a portion of an upper floor
without doubt he had fallen or been
hurled six stories to the concrete pit
below that he had not committed sui-
cide was certain there was no reason
why he should in the first place and in
the second place two reliable witnesses
swore they had heard him cry damn
you moriarity as he fell
  moriarity had been arrested of
course but released almost at once be-
cause policemen as well as eminently
respectable citizens had seen him a
block away from the building at the
same time that hardys scream was
heard by the night watchman and ele-
vator man of the building
  it had taken some time to drag
hardys body from the pit and identify
it this caused a delay but even at that
the police admitted they probably would
have been unable to make out a case
against the old leader no matter how
rapidly they worked
  captain bush who knows probably
as much about gangsters and gang poli-
tics as any police officer in the city had
ordered the arrest of moriarity as soon
as he heard of hardys death he did
that even before he knew that the old
leader was the last man seen with the
new chieftain he was also the one
who recommended the discharge of the
prisoner the next morning
  there are more ways than one of
killing a cat captain bush remarked
philosophically to some of his news-
paper friends and the law doesnt
keep up with all of them
  but you admit hardy was alone
when he fell down the elevator shaft
persisted one of his questioners why
do you think he was killed 
  he was killed as surely as terence
is again king of the woodchucks re-
plied the police veteran he was killed
because moriarity had lost his nerve
he was killed in the way he was be-
cause of the long nights moriarity had
spent in the death house by a man who
knew that if hardy was killed by a shot

the weeping killer
he would walk through the little door
instead of the big one on his second
trip from his cell he was killed by a
man with brains and that imagination
which had made him a tamed slayer
  i know what happened as surely as
i	know i am sitting here but there
would be no use in going into court
with it
  hardy had openly challenged the old
leaders authority everybody knows
that even the boys on the street were
mocking moriarity he had wept in
court he had been seen twice walking
unsteadily out of the building wiping
his eyes with his handkerchief and
seeming to be half blinded by tears
once the elevator man had to help him
to the street everybody in the dis-
trict knew about it he was in pitiful
terror at the thought of the time when
hardy would pull a gun on him and
challenge him to fight it out he knew
that when that time came he would
either have to go back to the death
house be killed by hardy or disappear
there wasnt much choice one was as
bad as another for him so like the
man of brains he is he discarded all
three of the obvious alternatives and
found a fourth way out of the meeting
he knew would have to come
  it came last saturday night the
two of them were alone in the club-
room not a man in the gang would
have dared to stick his nose inside the
door they knew there would be no
question about who their leader was be-
fore morning and there wasnt one of
them within a mile of the place
  the elevator man and the night
watchman both heard them quarreling
they didnt hear the words but we
dont need them hardy taunted mori-
arity to try to make him pull a gun he
had two-one his own and another for
moriarity in case he had none of his
own this second gun was loaded with
blanks
  there were two flasks in the room
one had gin in it and was still half full
the other was broken on the floor when
moriarity dropped it as hardy pulled
his gun and called upon him to fight
  after dropping the flask moriarity
walked out of the room and down the
stairs wiping the tears from his eyes
as he had been seen doing twice before
the watchman saw him the elevator
man was on the top floor with his car
moriarity had sent him there to put a
new bolt on the roof scuttle he swears
the door at the club floor was closed
when he went up-but elevator men
always say that anyway the light was
burning in the hall thats all he
knows until he heard hardy scream
  but how then did moriarity kill
him a reporter asked as the captain
relighted his cigar
  ever hear of this new tear gas
the policeman questioned thats
what was in the other flask
  but wouldnt it blind moriarity
too 
  it did but he had experimented
until he could find his way out of the
building in spite of it the effect
wears off in a few minutes and by the
time he had reached the corner he was
merely crying a few tears and had his
alibi all made to order meanwhile
hardy was blundering about until he
found the elevator door and fell to his
death
  an act of providence i suppose the
law might call it but it was really the
act of a damned clever devil
the finishing touch
by charles s wolfe
i
ah a s t y survey assured
ridgely that he was alone 
the star-lit country road with
a sigh of satisfaction he
plunged swiftly into the brush which
skirted the roadside there he paused
alert until his straining ears convinced
him that his movements had been un-
observed then he made himself com-
fortable for his brief vigil
  crouching there he reviewed mi-
nutely his actions so far and his plans
for what was to come there was yet
time if he had erred if there was a
flaw to withdraw quietly it was
merely a matter of waiting for another
night to be confronted with the dam-
age wrought by an overlooked trifle
when it was too late would be agonizing
and his very confidence disquieted him
made him feel that there was some-
thing amiss
  yet he could find no weak link in
his carefully forged chain his left
hand dropping into his coat pocket
found the bottle of cyanide of potas-
sium solution securely corked and ready
to assume its role his automatic
weighed heavily in the other pocket
well oiled and loaded the light mask
which now covered the upper half of
his face was really of no impor-
tance just an extra precaution which
discounted the possible but highly
improbable intrusion of some pedes-
trian
  the cyanide he felt sure no one
would be able to trace several weeks
before he had stolen a couple of small
lumps-quite enough for his purpose-
  b m-dec- 
from the private laboratory of a friend
who rode the hobby of chemistry few
people knew of the existence of the
little attic laboratory fewer still were
aware of his acquaintance with its
owner and the man himself was igno-
rant of the fact that his supply had been
levied on
  since the deadly stuff had been dis-
solved and bottled and the bottle
scrupulously cleaned he had taken pains
to avoid touching it bare handed right
now his left hand was gloved with rub-
ber there would be no finger-prints
to damn him
  footprints need give him  con-
cern the roadway was dry and
reasonably hard the discoverers of
the corpse would quickly obliterate any
slight clews of a definite nature that he
might thus leave the keenest of
sleuths could examine the scene of his
crime to their hearts content they
would learn nothing
  he had made no attempt to establish
an alibi and in this he was satisfied
he had acted wisely the business of
trying to demonstrate that you were
where you were not is usually a dan-
gerous undertaking it involves either
the employment of confederates or
the use of complicated subterfuges
which must either function with pre-
cision or turn into veritable boome-
rangs the collapsing alibi is too often
the royal road to the electric chair
ridgely knew that there was just one
person who could be relied on to be
forever silent on this nights work-
himself better to take the chance of
the authorities being unable to prove
that he was on the spot at the time than


the finishing touch
to assume the burden of proving that
he was not
  and anyway most of the precautions
he had taken were no doubt unneces-
sary they represented merely his
forethought in forestalling unlooked for
disaster before it occurred the
chances were that the case would be
looked on as just what it seemed on the
surface-suicide there would prob-
ably be little more than a perfunctory
inquiryan inquest at which every fact
produced would seem to demonstrate
conclusively that the man took his own
life ridgely prided himself that the
idea of killing a man by forcing him to
kill himself was a master stroke
  a man found dead on the road dead
from the effects of poison and with
the bottle containing that poison
clutched tightly in his stiffened hand is
obviously a suicide there is no rea-
son to suspect foul play unless someone
is knowh to have a strong motive for
putting the unfortunate one out of the
way and to the best of ridgelys
knowledge and belief maury hadnt an
enemy in the world-save himself
  and thanks to his consistent and
flawless dissimulation his secret was
his own outwardly he had been quite
friendly with maury not too friendly
-just enough so to be counted really
indifferent in the rare event of mur-
der being suspected and a murderer
sought for there would be no reason
for alarm
  one other only might possibly con-
nect him with the nights events
maurys wife jean maury and
ridgely shared a rather guilty secret
she could assign to him a motive but
here again he was confident that per-
fect technique had practically nullified
the danger of aroused suspicion by
guarding every word by well planned
and controlled actions he had assured
her belief that he-like herself-was a
harmless flirt not once had she been
permitted to glimpse the terrible passion
that was his never had she been al-
lowed to plumb the depths of his crafty
and daring nature he was safe on
that score under the pretence of care-
fully guarding her reputation he had
concealed their affair from outsiders
and to her herself he had made the mat-
ter seem trivial
  there was one circumstance how-
ever that might cause comment and
as he thought of it ridgely grinned
while it was true that no one appar-
ently had a motive for slaying maury
it was equally true that the man had
no apparent motive for killing himself
happy care-free comfortably wealthy
and well satisfied with life people might
wonder that he should court death
  ridgely grinned for it was to this
to his mind the weakest point of his
whole coup that he had devoted the
most thought expended the greatest
effort he had supplied the motive
here was the artistic triumph of the
whole thing here was the finishing
touch
  for the suspicions of the authorities
would be allayed before they were
aroused during the three months that
he had known the maurys he had
quietly unobstrusively collected speci-
mens of john maurys handwriting
and by diligent practice he had enabled
himself to imitate the mans scrawl so
perfectly that he had no fear of the
fraud being detected not only the
writing itself had he studied minutely
but the style the tricks of speech be-
yond doubt the missive he had evolved
with so much care would pass unques-
tioned as the dead mans own work
  he drew forth an envelope and by
the light of his electric torch scrutinized
with pride and satisfaction the letter he
had written the envelope was ad-
dressed to mrs john maury
my dear jean
   i am sorry terribly sorry for the notoriety
the finishing touch

this thing will cause i realize that you will
be shocked i am asking your forgiveness
for four years i have suffered in silence
jean for our marriage was a bitter mistake
 did not love you  realized it when it was
too late ive done my best to conceal the
fact from you but i know i could not go
on living a lie much longer i am taking the
easiest way out it is only just that i should
suffer for my own sin
john
  as he replaced the letter in its en-
velope ridgely chuckled he would
place this missive in the mans pocket
after he had fallen and there was the
motive all ready to satisfy the most
critical scandal-loving eyes scanning
maurys past for sensational disclosures
of his implied double life would not
dwell too closely on the method of his
taking off furnish-
  he stiffened the soft thud of mov-
ing feet on the hard road reached his
ears growing steadily louder he knew
it was maury the moment had come
ii
  ridgelys hand closed resolutely over
his automatic maury he knew was
unarmed he slipped soundlessly to
the very edge of the copse and waited
until the approaching form was only a
few feet from his ambush then he
sprang out weapon leveled barring the
way
  there was a startled oath as maury
caught sight of the ominous figure be-
fore him ridgelys gruff command to
throw up his hands was instantly
obeyed the surprise was complete
  dont speak-ridgely rather hoped
that his disguised voice would com-
pletely mask his identity but it didnt
matter really-do as youre told you
are going to sleep for an hour or so
while i clean you and make my get-
away
  really maury was regaining his
nerve i havent enough about me to
make it worth your while-
  shut up ridgelys command was
curt as he advanced toward his victim
the deadly bottle in his gloved left hand
he extended it toward maury
  drink it he growled determinedly
  maury lowered one arm and took the
bottle hesitatingly what is it he
asked falteringly
  chloral hydrate if you must know
responded ridgely in tones of well-
feigned sulkiness enough to put you
out for a couple of hours knockout
drops take your choice drink it
and go out for a couple of hours or-
he waved the automatic suggestively
go out for keeps
  look here began maury ill
promise-
  drink it ridgely snapped sav-
agely
  without further parley maury raised
the bottle to his lips it was only an
instant really but to ridgley waiting
anxiously it seemed hours before the
body crumpled to the roadway then
swiftly he went to his victim pocketing
his automatic his gloved hand in-
serted the letter into maurys pocket
he noted that the bottle was tightly
gripped in the dead mans hand and
noiselessly he stole away from the
place
  a short cut through a little wood-
land brought him out onto a main road
without haste he wended his way
toward the summer hotel he was
jubilant maury was out of his way
he had only to wait the proper moment
to increase the ardor of his courting
he felt that the widow would lend an
attentive ear
  he passed no one on the road
everything was coming his way as
he gained his room unobserved he was
whistling softly not a pang of re-
morse came to sear his conscience
ridgely wasnt that kind he turned in
and slept like a top
  he was awakened by a sharp knock-

the finishing touch
mg on the room door bright sunlight
was streaming hi through the thinly
curtained windows a hasty glance
at the clock told him that it was after
ten the knocking continued in-
sistently
  he sprang out of bed and reached for
his bathrobe
  just a minute he called as he
hurriedly pulled a comb through his
tousled hair
  an instant later fairly presentable
he was gazing inquiringly at the tall
young man who had pushed in through
the partly opened door
  even before the other had introduced
himself ridgely knew that his caller
was a detective something must have
gone wrong he thought and his mjnd
went racing swiftly over the details of
the evening before seeking to find and
forestall the consequences of a slip he
was not panicky
  his visitor was speaking john
maury was found dead on the road late
last night mr ridgely
  ridgely carefully side-stepped a pos-
sible trap an accident he asked
in perfectly done surprise and concern
  no replied the other he was
murdered
   ridgely concealed his dismay how
 in the devil had they reached that
 conclusion so soon in the face of his
 carefully prepared evidence to the
 contrary
   murdered he echoed blankly
 how by whom
    the tall young man sat down watch-
 ing ridgely narrowly his right hand
 had dropped carelessly into his pocket
 he leaned forward slightly and spoke
 swiftly
    by you mr ridgely he replied
 evenly no dont interrupt you
  set a very pretty stage my friend and
 you have been careful-careful to a
 fault it was your little finishing touch
 that betrayed you that and a
 womans vanity mrs maury is a very
 beautiful woman with a very plain
 name it has been her little failing to
 hide that fact her name is not jean
 ridgely its jane and maury never
 called her anything else in private
 when she saw that letter you so cleverly
 left she knew maury had never written
 it despite the excellent forgery for
 he hated the name jean as much as she
 disliked jane she is a big enough
 woman to admit her own shortcomings
 and- shall i read the warrant
the trap thief
 by hy s watson and asa steele
i
htihe low-down sneaking thief
   i	jack ramseys wrath hissed on
 his lips as he flung the steel
traps to the ground of thirty
all but two had been stolen
  wrinkles of perplexity seamed his
face as he sprawled on a great rock in
the wilderness munched his lunch and
stared at a distant hilltop
  jack ramseys blue-gray eyes did not
lack shrewdness with his tawny hair
long face and lean jaw they were com-
bined in a type of youth not easily de-
ceived he concluded that the thief
had followed him the night before
through brush fern and swamp and
taken each trap as soon as he had
moved on to the next one
  but why steal them the thief had
a grudge against him  he had come
from the neighboring town of hones-
dale where he had lost his job in a
mill and was trapping here till he got
other work being a stranger in the
neighborhood he could have no ene-
mies perhaps his traps had been
stolen by a some hobo-
  the thought brought jack upstand-
ing tossing the crumbs of his lunch
to a scolding squirrel he set off at a
brisk pace northward
  the confidence of his advance
proved that no part of this strange
place was unfamiliar to him yet few
domains of equal size set up so many
barriers against a close acquaintance
in some distant age a great glacier
crushing and combing the mountains to
the north as it advanced had here
found a conqueror in hot sunshine as
the ice field melted vast masses of
granite boulders pebbles and gravel
buried in the frozen depths were cast
into hummocks resembling little moun-
tains or piled in driftways or stacks
like playing cards or ears of corn in
indescribable confusion thus was
formed this utterly barren haphazard
place some five miles square now
honeycombed with swamps or covered
where the rocks permitted by bush or
forest
  around this land passed modern
highways aeroplanes soared overhead
toward it thriving new jersey towns
were crowding close thirty-five miles
away as the crow flies stood the city
hall of new york the worlds greatest
metropolis yet the hardships that must
be faced while penetrating this natural
fortress caused it to remain almost un-
known and shunned by men
  jack ramsey recalled having seen
while hunting in previous years a de-
serted cabin built by lumbermen on a
rocky knoll near the northern end of
the wilderness here might live the
tramps who were helping themselves to
his traps he would call them to
time
  his visit to the cabin was one of sur-
prises from the crooked chimney
curled smoke that intrigued his nostrils
with odors of sassafras and newly made
coffee crumbling woodwork had been
replaced and the windows reglazed and
hung with curtains of snowy whiteness
flowers were blooming in a border
along a wall
  the door was opened by an upstand-
ing buxom girl sweet and wholesome
as the sunshine that had tanned her


the trap thief
cheeks and bare forearms at sight of
him her eyes brightened
  a drink of water please
  sure thing bring fresh water
jimmie
  the man addressed was sitting in a
corner shaping a billet of wood with a
hunting knife when he raised his pale
bearded face ramsey recognized jimmie
willets a half-wit whom he had met in
the wilderness
  jimmies my policeman while dads
away the girl volunteered theres
just my father and me and for me to
be here alone all day while hes at work
-i just couldnt oh i forgot im
mary gage-
  im jack ramsey from honesdale
while jimmie willets brought the
water and jack drank of the cool sweet
draft the young trapper fell into chat
with the girl like an old friend jack
sensed a warm and gracious womanhood
and the invitation  one hungry for
companionship while the girl with that
instinctive wisdom as old as womankind
whetted his interest by urging him to
talk about himself
  its a great life i lead here he en-
thused even the winds blow sweet
and clean i can breathe free dream
free and hope free this is the ameri-
cans heritage its his when the mys-
tery of blue distances gets into his
heart-
  my with all those fine thoughts
you should have a more romantic name
she teased an appraising common sense
behind her laughter it makes me think
of buffalo bill and lcatherstocking and
savage men hunting wild beasts-i have
it hereafter ill call you lean jaw
he felt the sting of her raillery as he
laughed with her yet he would not
have had it otherwise longed for it
again
  truly though he went on in a
desert like this you might almost expect
to see indians- oh dont be fright-
ened you folks and i are the only
people here ive had no company but
the skunk stray mink and what-not that
are caught in my traps yet i dont
get lonely do you
  oh no
  was she interested in hunting jack
thought she might explore the wilder-
ness with him and see his traps
  then youre the man whose traps
were stolen she asked quickly as if
the words had escaped her unawares
you know about that 
  she went-to a dresser and took from
it five new steel traps which she flung
on a table at ramseys elbow
  theyre mine lie cried stolen
last night
  i found them on the road to hones-
dale she replied
  but thats five miles away youve
been down there so early in the day
the thief must have dropped them
on his way to town
  swiftly a veil of mistrust had been
drawn between them he was seeking
an answer to his doubts with a look
as bold as hers had been a moment
since she turned away a crimson glow
mounting to her temples in the length-
ening silence jack had no alternative
but to thank the girl and go
  shed have no reason to steal my
traps said jack to himself as he fol-
lowed the trail southward if she had
she wouldnt confess it by returning
them to me
  blind as a bat mary gage re-
marked to jimmie willets as she
watched ramsey go he wont guess
our secret till he falls head first into it
ii
  jack lingered over his traps that even-
ing till it was almost dark watching
for the return of the thief there be-
ing no sign of one he finally made his
way to his camp
the trap thief

  in a swamp near the middle of the
wilderness lay a low mass of rock cov-
ered with woodland on this island
jack had set up a shelter of poles can-
vas and spruce boughs and stored his
food and equipment a dry winding
path across the swamp had ends which
he had cunningly concealed from casual
eyes
  in the darkness he wrapped himself
in his blankets and stretched himself on
a heap of spruce twigs to sleep how
long he lay thus he could not tell sud-
denly he found himself wide awake
staring at a light shining across the
swamp
  beyond the causeway boulders were
piled fifty feet high in ragged confusion
ending abruptly in a flattened top jack
had named it the bag of bones on the
summit out of reach of plundering lum-
bermen rose a stately ash its boughs
flung wide
  it was among the leaves of this
ash tree that the rays of light were shin-
ing any natural source for them was
discounted by the fact that the light rose
from below so great was its power
that the leaves and branches over which
it strayed were stamped with the bril-
liant vividness of sunshine
  ramsey stumbled toward the cause-
way before he reached it the light
had vanished he stared into the dark-
ness to make sure then kicked himself
for his stupidity a searchlight in the
bowels of the earth was too grotesque
for belief he returned to his bed cer-
tain he had been dreaming
  through the mist of the early morn-
ing he made a round of his traps of
the thirty on this day eighteen were
missing ramseys eyes grew hard he
began a thorough combing of the wild-
erness searching for traces of the thief
  finally he found footprints beside a
brook they had been made by a short
broad shoe on the soles of which had
been fastened strips of iron in the form
of a double cross to obtain a firmer
foothold on uncertain ground
  with dogged patience ramsey traced
these footprints through woodland
gully swamp and meadow they led
toward the road to honesdale he had
nearly reached this road when the foot-
prints were merged with the ruts of a
heavy automobile the car had been
driven several times into a deserted lum-
ber trail turned and taken out again
  suddenly he saw that which made him
conceal himself in a heap of boulders
and stare cautiously through a screen
of laurel toward the highway
  a man had jumped out of a big high-
powered car and scurried into the neigh-
boring forest the car passed on as the
stranger mounted a hillock and climbed
a pine tree to the topmost branches
  in a few minutes the car came back
a whistle sounded from the lookout in
the pine tree the automobile was
turned into the trail and stopped in the
old tracks two men leaped from the
tonneau one of them was carrying sev-
eral packages while the chauffeur
turned the car these passengers walked
quickly to a large stone and by their
united strength turned it over as if it
were hinged and balanced one of the
men took a small package from the cav-
ity beneath the other deposited in it the
parcels he was carrying the stone was
lowered into place and a moment later
the men were in the automobile
  one of the passengers whistled no
answer from the pine tree a motor-
cycle came into view on the main road
the men in the car exchanged glances
whispering and one of them shook his
head
  a low whisde from the pine tree as-
sured them that the way was clear
the automobile shot out of the lumber
trail into the highroad and disappeared
as the lookout descended from the pine
tree and walked away in the opposite
direction

the trap thief
  hastening from cover jack struggled
to move the flat stone it might have
been bed rock so sturdily did it resist his
strength he recalled that it had re-
quired the efforts of both passengers
from the automobile to shift its balance
so he could not hope to stir it unassisted
the hollow beneath and the parcels it
contained preserved their secret but
he resolved to return and watch again
ill
  the second theft of traps had crip-
pled jacks enterprise so with his store
of skins he went to honesdale sold the
pelts and refitted turning a balance of
cash over to his mother after supper
he strolled downtown to the cigar store
of his friend bert walton
  as he passed the hotel he did not
notice two men on the verandah who
were regarding him closely
  thats him whispered one of them
to his burly companion
  that kid
  sure thing knows more about that
stretch of woods than anyone round
here	
  doesnt look as if he stood in with
crooks
  dont believe he does unless gages
girl has hypnotized him youd better
find out-about that go to it say you
want to hunt- you know
  so it came that when the big burly
man strolled into waltons cigar store
nodded to bert like an old customer and
bought a costly cigar the proprietor in-
troduced him to jack ramsey the
stranger came from new york and went
by the name of cox could ramsey
take him hunting when jack saw the
color of his money-a twenty-dollar bill
-a bargain was struck early the next
morning cox hired a flivver and in it
they rattled northward
  reaching the wilderness jack found
a familiar trail and they plunged into
it stopping the flivver in a grassy gully
  what dye know about that cried
cox pointing o long furrows in the
sod
  theyre automobile tracks
  it has been here often-a big bang-
up classy city car
  jack told him of the mysterious visit
of the automobilists the lookout in the
pine tree and the balanced stone
  lets have a look at that stone sug-
gested cox
  with their united strength they moved
the slab under it was a cavity three
feet square and of half that depth it
was empty
  the stone replaced cox insisted that
they go back to the main road and find
another entrance to the forest no com-
plaints would make him alter the plan or
did he offer an explanation as they drove
to a new parking place a mile further
up the road
  ramsey began to think that he had
a queer bird on his hands as the hours
passed the opinion was confirmed by
coxs impatience his half-interest in the
hunting and his curiosity and questions
in no way connected with their sport
  perhaps the boys impatience arose
from the fact that his own thoughts
were not on hunting in the quivering
golden-purple haze of indian summer
came dreams dancing lightly or touch-
ing reverently things which another held
intimate in his minds eye he was
watching the sunlight as it filtered
through the golden-brown hair of mary
gage and painted her cheek in wonder-
ful colors like the heart of the rose
again he saw her dimples come and go-
say sonny when i see a kid like
you cox finally remarked absent-
minded and dreaming of hither and yon
so to speak i know it means just one
thing whos the girl
 aw-mr cox-i-
  come long who is she
  point by point cox learned mary
the trap thief

gages name where she lived of her
family and surroundings
  sounds good to me was his com-
ment lets give her the once over
although jack feared the blunders
the rough-neck might make with mary
hs anxiety proved to be groundless
when they reached the cabin cox was
as decent as could be even thqjjgh mary
gage received liim with visible mistrust
toward jack she acted as an old friend
who had suddenly become silent-silent
and watchful
  some girl all right sonny cox com-
mented when they were out of earshot
of the cabin i suppose shed only
have to ask it and youd cut off your 
right hand or rob a bank or go to the
electric chair for her sake
  she hasnt asked anything like
that
  what if she should now
  oh- ill cross that bridge when i
come to it 
  jack did not see the appraising look
with which his companion regarded him
cox nodded in approval as they trudged
on
  the visitor had insisted that they go to
jacks camp when they reached the
rocky island in the swamp he shared
in cooking their lunch with the joy of
a schoolboy playing hookey
  this is real roughing it he de-
clared certainly a queer place though
looks as if nature got tired or went
nutty when she came to this job that
bunch of rocks across the swamp now-
some giants kid might have piled em
up for a playhouse-
  i call that the bag of bones replied
jack with a laugh
  not a bad name either cox buried
his face in his coffee mug
  for a moment jack was tempted to
tell of the mysterious light which he
had seen on the summit of the bag of
bones then the impulse passed the
incident was too fantastic too much like
a dream for the boy to trust his senses
and vouch for its truth
  their meal ended cox decided to re-
turn at once to honesdale they had
crossed the swamp and were passing thy
southern side of the bag of bones when
he came to a sudden halt
  say sonny he drawled do you
get it that funny smell
  i sure do a volatile odor filled
jacks nostrils
  what dye suppose makes it
  it smells like ether
  right now who dye suppose uses
ether in among them rocks  he asked
with a laugh hardly a place id look
for a chorus girl cleaning her gloves
  cox parted with jack curtly his
thoughts seemed to be on other things
watching the flivver recede along the
highway the boy suspected that his
visitor had not come to the forest mere-
ly to hunt what other purpose could
he have had ramsey had not found
an answer to the riddle when after set-
ting his new traps he made his way
through the twilight to his camp
  approaching the rocky island he saw
 t once that something unusual had hap-
pened there a rapid survey confirmed
his fears his camp so far as malice
could accomplish it had been destroyed
  jacks lean jaws snapped the fight-
ing blood of his yankee ancestors
surged to his face he snatched up his
gun and crouched beside the causeway
to watch under the stars
iv
  into the rebuilding of his camp the
next day ramsey put much of his defi-
ance every pole that he cut every nail
driven had in it hatred for his unknown
enemies the supplies he had brought
from honesdale in coxs flivver and
cached near the highway assured his
comfort he prepared for a siege
  also he determined to protect his

the trap thief
traps two forked hickory saplings
near a secluded trail which the thief
must follow suggested a means in the
forks he wedged his gun tightly point-
ing it upward to cover the trail and brac-
ing the barrel and butt with stakes
crossed near the tops the weapon ad-
justed and loaded he fastened a stout
cord to the trigger and passed it among
the saplings so that it was stretched
tightly across the trail thus the thief
could not press against the cord without
firing a charge of buckshot into himself
  ramsey slept that night in a thicket
near his man-trap in the early morn-
ing a crash awakened him the bark
of his gun the boy broke from cover
into the trail and shouted at a vague
crouching figure near the gun at sight
of jack the man gave a leap and dis-
appeared in the neighboring woodland
  came the patter of footsteps on the
soft earth the light steps of one run-
ning ramsey drew back into the
shadow of the wood alert on his toes
as a panther gathered to spring if occa-
sion demands
  it was not the fellow whom he had
seen at first but apparently his accom-
plice the flying body tensely bent the
arms outflung in an extremity of effort
in a moment the fugitive was upon
him-
  stop-
  jacks outflung hand arrested the
flight of mary gage the girl sank at
his feet panting from exhaustion
  you know now-im the trap thief
she gasped presently
  im not accusing you he replied
helping her to her feet
  dont be polite youre not blind
an outflung hand brushing the tangled
hair from her eyes served as well to
sweep aside the amenities i didnt be-
lieve youd set a gun to catch us since
you did it would have been better if i
had been shot im the guilty one and
ir my right mind not a poor half-wit-
  you mean jimmie willets was
shot
  yes but dont worry about jim-
mie our friends will give him the best
of care
  i dont see- why did you and he
go out night after night to steal my
traps 
  for a moment she seemed to be grop-
ing for an excuse then turned to him
with a childlike frankness
  i know you wont believe me lean
jaw but im telling the truth when i
say i dont know why we must steal
your traps we took them because-
we were asked to do so you should
know perhaps that were very poor-
stony broke we came here last spring
from long island where dads truck
farm went to smash and left us in debt
dad was offered this job of his and
much more money than hed ever earned
before he told me a few days ago that
his job and our money would be lost un-
less you were driven out of here he
asked me to take your traps-
  i interfered with his plans- is that
it
  dad told me that the kick came from
his bosses oh dont be huffy about
it i like you lean jaw- like you
as well as any fellow i know i like you
so well that i say-first last and all the
time-dont butt into this give up
trapping and go back to honesdale you
cant fight these people single handed
theyre too strong too many and have
too much money back of them ive
been jollying dad by telling him youre
discouraged and about to quit i can
hardly say that now that youre fighting
back and jimmie willets is hurt but
its not too late for you to get out-
  you would have me go he asked
tensely
  id have you near me- she cut
short his words of tenderness and added
in her businesslike way but you dont
know yet the secret of dads bosses

the trap thief
if you should stumble on it someday
then good-bye lean jaw-
  these men you speak of theyre
here in the wilderness
  sure they are is there a better
place to work secretly within a hundred
miles of new york
  what are they doing you must
have a hint of it must have learned
something-
  i told dad i wouldnt ask and i
havent she evaded
  perhaps i know more than you
mary with what ive learned and you
suspect we may piece out the truth
he told her of the strong light and the
odor of ether near the bag of bones
the footprints with their curious ridges
the big automobile the outlook in the
pine tree and the balanced stone
  youre wise she observed crypti-
cally oh lean jaw i beg of you-
go at once after what youve
learned-
  he knows too much eh
  they turned quickly at the sound of
the voice behind them
  dad
  jack saw a big man in jumpers red
with rage his chin aggressive
  if youve told him our secrets mary
ill-ill just about kill you gage
threatened shaking a wrathful finger at
his daughter with a quick turn he
confronted ramsey you get out of
here i wont have you round-
  ive as much right here as you-
if you dont go i wont answer for
your life-
  jack glanced toward mary there
was a helplessness a wordless appeal in
her lax hands and drooping shoulders
her eyes were raised to his with a mes-
sage that decided him
  ill stay he announced
  then look out for trouble
  same to you mr gage- much
trouble
  thus he left them
v
  before another day had passed ram-
sey realized that gages threat had not
been an idle one go where he would
he was followed by enemies behind
him the rustle of dead leaves and the
breaking of twigs underfoot told of the
passage of living things heavier than
the denizens of the forest once he
had a glimpse of a man with a black
beard who when he realized that he
was seen quickly disappeared in a heap
of rocks
  as ramsey crossed the causeway to
his camp that evening came an under-
breath caught-in-the-throat cough and
a bullet glanced off a tree overhead and
went winging its way into the swamp
another and another followed hum-
ming baleful tunes as they were de-
flected from the shelter of a rock
ramsey realized that his assailants were
using a silencer on their gun and were
shooting wild in all he counted twenty
bullets a return fire would have be-
trayed his position in the darkness and
made it a target in silence he crouched
low
  suddenly he saw the sharp bright
gleam of an electric flashlight it dis-
closed the outlines of two men moving
toward him across the causeway-
  in an instant the light was gone but
ramseys eyes had marked his target
his gun spat fire a startled muttered
curse told him that his bullet had reached
its mark again his gun barked he
heard his assailants floundering in mud
and water as they retreated the com-
batants settled themselves for a term of
vigilant waiting
  jack realized that the encircling
swamp made his island camp a prison
as well as a refuge his assailants knew
this too and were keeping the only exit
along the causeway covered ramseys
back was to the wall
  that he should admit defeat and re-
the trap thief

turn to honesdale was unthinkable
the plight of mary gage prevented he
would risk his life with these unseen
foes without fear or hesitation to in-
sure her safety with this conviction
came the overwhelming certainty of all
she meant to him life without her
would hereafter be a leaden thing halt-
ing and incomplete for her he was
here
  he must see mary and confront her
father the only one of his enemies
whom he knew he must go at once
but how his wits sharpened by the
contest devised a means of escape
from the island prison
  while building his-new camp he had
salvaged some planks from an aban-
doned saw mill noiselessly feeling his
way toward them he chose two of the
larger ones and crossed to the opposite
side of the island here he slowly
crawled forward on the planks relaying
them from hummock to hummock above
the mud and stagnant water it was
slow uncertain work but he finally
reached the further shore and started
xlorthward
  he approached gages cabin with the
utmost caution two windows bright
with light tared at him as if enraged
creeping close to one of them which
was partly open his back against the
wall and face hidden by the shadows
of a vine he could see a section of the
interior and hear the murmur of low-
pitched voices
  one was that of the skulking fellow
with the black beard
  take it from me- theyre on
he declared someone has played the
yellow dog they have been told all
about us details they could only get by
living here and being one of our
bunch- 
  and because you think im the yel-
low dog you wont pay my wages-
that it snapped gage
  hold on- we would have finished
the job and been out of here last week
except for this blunder the fresh kid
conies along and learns enough here to
put cox wise so we stand to lose
much more than we owe you your
girl has queered the deal-
  indeed-indeed i told jack noth-
ing mary pleaded he was wide-
awake learned things for himself-
she did as you said didnt she pro-
tested gage tried to drive ramsey
away-she and jimmie-till he put his
gun on her no i worked hard for my
money and intend to get it
  when youve earned it thats my
last word snapped the other now
if you could get ramsey-
  what dye want asked gage slow-
ly youd have me rid ourselves of
the boy by cold-blooded murder
  if it means your money our safe-
ty-
  murder whispered the girl then
her voice shrilled in protest you shant
harm him-ill prevent that i wont
keep secrets any longer for a crook like
you- no not even for my father
ill find this man cox ill tell him
everything 
  from the way the girl talks sneered
the visitor id say she wants to marry
this jack ramsey-
  yes i would marry him- the
impulsive words died breathlessly her
eyes opened wide as she stared at the
window for jack unable to control
his eagerness had thrust forward to
hear her reply in paralyzing fear at
sight of him she sat as one entranced
  gages mocking laugh had drawn at-
tention from the girl the bearded man
watched him as lie crossed to a shelf
filled his pipe and lighted it in that
brief moment jacks face disappeared
marys body relaxed
  you realize gage came the visi-
tors even tones that after what your
daughter has just said we cant let her
go free till our job is done

the trap thief
  hum keep her prisoner where
shes safe enough here
  no cox knows of this cabin-
thanks to ramsey its the first place
hell come we must keep her in the
workshop-
  no no i wont go cried the
girl
  youll do as i say mary-
  not even for you dad
  you go to the workshop
  then ill get word to jack hell
have to know only a little will guess the
rest her voice rose high that jack
might hear beyond the window he
heeded ill say-lean jaw under
the ash tree on the rocks lift the hollow
stump-
  an oath the girls muffled cry- si-
lence 
  ramsey could endure no more like
a tiger he moved swiftly and softly to
the door he flung it open stood before
them
  jack- in the girls agony she
sank weeping before him
  the three men confronted each other
silently the boy was now a tiger bid-
ing his time to kill gages fists opened
and closed ready to strike
  the tail of the yellow dog mur-
mured he of the black beard as his fin-
gers sought a shining weapon in his
coat
  mary you must come with me
jack commanded
  must i like that gages laughter
was savage with menace
  you mean more to me than i can
tell you mary the boy pleaded the
thought of you a prisoner at the mercy
of these beasts-i cant bear it come
ill take you to my mother-
  i prayed that you might escape
them sobbed the girl i prayed that
youd not come here that youd be kept
safe till my need was great-
  your need is great now i heard
them- theyd hold you prisoner-
what more who can tell how can
you be safe with these crooks-
  im her father thundered gage
ive seen what you can do you and
your gang jack sneered robbing
me wrecking my camp trying to mur-
der me tonight with a muffled gun
come mary
  the girl rose unsteadily she studied
jacks face then stared at her father-
freedom and tenderness in the boys
waiting arms or with the other re-
straint worse-	
she moved toward jack gages out-
stretched arm restrained her
  ramseys going another way re-
marked the bearded one he thought
he was cunning enough to queer our job
so hes got to pay-
  his weapon flashed from a pocket
he raised it deliberately and fired
  the world seemed to go to pieces in a
vast upheaval as ramsey sank down
down to oblivion-
vi
  brace up take a nip of this its
bootleg but the real stuff
  ramsey felt the sting of the liquor in
his throat radiating warmth throughout
his body he tried to shake off the
evil dream but could not after untold
effort he opened his eyes he was lying
in the tonneau of a touring car cox
bent over him regarding him anx-
iously
  lucky he only ripped open your
scalp he said half an inch lower
and it would have been the end of you
pull yourself together sonny
  mary- gasped the boy
  show me where she is and well get
the whole outfit
shes a prisoner in the cabin-
  i guess not we got there just
too late the bunch had flown the coop
threw you out at the roadside thought
they could shift the blame or hide their
the trap thief

trail maybe feel better now good
lets go
  with this cox started the car and
they sped swiftly southward along a
smooth highway the sense of time
and distance came to the wounded boy
vaguely but presently the white glare
of the road gave place to cool arches of
trees and the car stopped
  a glimpse of the balanced stone now
raised on end aroused ramsey to reali-
ties they were in the old lumber trail
two other cars were parked in the gully
and a half dozen men lounged around
them two of them were handcuffed
a third came forward to cox
  we dodged the lookout and got them
as they came in he reported
  what had they with them
groceries paper and ether
youve been up to the bag of
bones
  yes sir no signs of them any-
where
 the bag of bones the words
aroused jack like the lash of a whip
there he and cox had smelled the ether
there jack had seen the flashing light-
in a rush of words the boy told of his
night vision the glow in the ash tree
on the rocks
  surest thing you know sonny cox
exploded they needed that light for
the fine points in their job
  jack was groping for other facts
which evaded him then clear as a
trumpet came mary gages words
lean jaw under the ash tree on the
rocks lift the hollow stump
  you say you can get no trace of
tltem he cried
  right
  then i can help me well go
to the bag of bones
  youre knocked out sonny-
  i must she is there
  brady grosman cox called
help the boy
  they lifted jack from the car two
men carrying him between them on
arms and hands doubly crossed jack
doggedly insisting cox hiding his anx-
iety in muttered curses the carriers
swaying and stumbling with their bur-
den they made their way along the
trail
  near the bag of bones two of coxs
men were on guard between them
handcuffed was the man with the black
beard
 good work cox commented
watch him close he faces a murder
charge no sign of the others
  no sir
  hoist me to the top of those rocks
tack insisted
  you aint going up there sonny
its the only way i can find out
lifting and shoving they raised jack
over the boulders at last they stood
on the level summit jack glanced at
the ash tree then studied the ground
beneath it	
  see there the hollow stump
two of you lift it
  say boy youve gone nutty-
  lift that hollow stump
  coxs men laid hands on the large
stump the roots of which seemed to be
deeply embedded in the earth as they
tugged at the rotting wood the stump
and a section of soil and rock came
away in ragged angles like a piece from
a picture puzzle disclosing the entrance
to a cave thus camouflaged on a trap
door by a master hand
  all of you down quick cox
ordered
  a rush to the opening the tumble of
men down a ladder shouts and the im-
pact of a struggle in the darkness be-
low a pistol shot a womans scream-
it happened too quickly to be measured
by time
  swiftly as it came however the fight
was not ended before ramsey was
on the ladder dropping into the
shadows

the trap thief
  he found mary benumbed with ter-
ror crouching in a corner of the cavern
raising her in his arms he comforted
and revived her mary sobbed out her
story with arms around his neck
  say sonny lets go cox finally
intervened thanks to you ive made
the neatest round-up in my fourteen
years of government service- crooks
printing press copper plates engravers
tools-the whole outfit have a look
at this- he extended a crisp twenty-
dollar bill-the neatest take-off youll
see in a blue moon
  mary-miss gage wants to go to
my mothers in honesdale
  hum- shes one of the gang
  i didnt know what they were doing
here- indeed cried the girl
  shes right there it was gage who
spoke scowling on them from the knot
of prisoners
  surely you wont punish her jack
insisted why mr cox she deserves
all the credit for this she told me how
to find the trapdoor to this cave
oh cox reflected in doubt we
might let her stay with your mother till
we need her in court-
  one of coxs men put in a decisive
word as he left his post as a guard
for the prisoners and came forward
jack saw that his left hand was covered
with bandages
  theyre right boss he said im
sure youre safe in letting her go miss
mary knew nothing of what was doing
here if she had been one of the gang
and had known about it i would have
found it out being with her all the
time-
  why jimmie willets cried the girl
present he replied with a grin
barring my whiskers and the other
camouflage
  then youre not half-witted
  not to notice it miss mary
  and you hanging around our cabin
all the time helping me steal the
traps-
  got to do crazy things in my job
miss mary
  oh jimmie
  ill take your word for it willets
cox remarked sonny will you and
miss gage accept our thanks and apolo-
gies youd better hustle along now
with your elopement
the mystery of the one-legged
man
                         by j b hawley
i
newspaper readers will re-
call the series of brutal and
seemingly senseless murders
that occurred in england and
were attributed to a criminal whom
some clever writer dubbed peg-leg
because after each of his appearances
he left conclusive evidence in the
form of footprints that he was minus
his right leg and wore in its place
an old-fashioned wooden affair end-
ing in a round steel ferrule
  i have said that these murders were
seemingly senseless affairs and that
must have been the opinion of every-
one who considered that they were
committed without any apparent mo-
tive from none of his victims was
anything stolen and in the history
of their lives there were no passages
to denote the existence of an enemy
who might kill in a spirit of revenge
for a real or fancied grievance
  the first of these horrible crimes
occurred in york the victim was
a certain john elder manufacturer
of buttons a highly respectable
citizen
  on the night of his death elder
had retired to his study to write
some letters as the evening was
warm he had opened the french win-
dow and according to the testimony
of his butler who was the last of his
household to see him alive had
dragged forward a small table and
b m-dec-
placed it just in the windows open-
ing he had seated himself beside
this table and begun to write when
the servant left the room
  at about eleven oclock this same
servant had heard a cry coming from
the study he had hurried to see if
anything were wrong with his mas-
ter and had found him lying beside
the table with a knife wound gaping
in his chest outside the french
window the police had found unmis-
takable footprints of a one-legged
man these they followed across the
lawn until they came to the road
where they became blurred and
finally lost in the medley of other
prints on this much-traveled thor-
oughfare
  of course the detectives rounded
up every one-legged man in york and
questioned them closely but all
had unquestionable alibis and as the
police were unable to discover or in-
vent a means of tracing the criminal
they eventually dropped the case
  peg-legs second victim was a lit-
tle higher on the social scale no
lover of english sport will ever for-
get the name of sir roger bascom
nor will the many unfortunate souls
whom he helped in their need be
more backward in cherishing his
memory as in the case of john el-
der bascom was killed between the
hours of eleven and midnight and
on the grounds of his estate in sus-
sex were found another series of the


the mystery of the one-legged man
footprints of a one-legged man be-
cause of his prominence the police
put forth their best efforts to run
down his murderer but these went
as unrewarded as had those of their
colleagues in york
  these two murders happened with-
in three months of each other then
for over a year peg-leg was not
heard from again his next appear-
ance was in london where on hemp-
stead heath he stabbed professor
thomas belding the noted authority
on eastern religions
  now i come to the last of peg-
legs activities his final murder
occurred here in camberwell and
robbed me of one of my dearest
friends
  the reverend frank parkington
was a bachelor and with young harry
fellows his curate lived in the old
stone vicarage just behind the church
of st annes he was in all particu-
lars the finest man i have ever
known a brilliant preacher a good
friend an ardent worker in his chosen
field
  his home was a rendezvous for a
few of us who over a convivial pipe
liked to discuss those matters of the
day that interested us on the night
of his death we had gathered at his
request to meet captain charles
wonderly the indian explorer who
was his guest we found this fel-
low wonderly a very interesting
talker he had traveled far and seen
much and knew how to picture in
words what he had seen with his
descriptions and anecdotes he held
us interested until well toward mid-
night
  i	remember that i arrived home at
about twelve-fifteen  retired imme-
diately but i did not go to sleep
at once as my mind was still full of
the captain wonderlys stories just
as i was dozing off i heard the church
clock strike two and at the same in-
stant there camc a violent ringing
at my door-bell
  i found harry fellows awaiting
me on my door-step
  come come quickly  he said in
a voice hoarse from excitement dr
parkington is dead-murdered 
 murdered good heavens man
are you mad i shouted taring
into his face that showed pale and
haggard in the feeble light of my hall
lamp
  for answer he reached out and
shook me roughly by the shoulder
  will you come he said fiercely
or shall i have to carry you
  had i not immediately shown signs
of obeying his demand i really be-
lieve the young giant would have
picked me up and carried me just as
i was in pajamas and slippers his
love for parkington who had been
more than a father to him was a
strong thing and at that moment his
grief made him less than reasonable
  in less than ten minutes we were on
the road to the vicarage as we hur-
ried through the still night fellows
briefly told me what had happened
ii
  after his guests had left parking-
ton and captain wonderly who was
staying for the night went to their
rooms because he had some work to
finish fellows had remained down
stairs at about one-fifteen he was
just finishing his writing when he
was startled and frightened by the
sound of a blood-curdling moan fol-
lowed by the sound of someone chok-
ing vs soon as he had pulled him-
self together he ran upstairs and
instinct guided him to parkingtons
room he knocked at the door and
when there was no answer he pushed
it open and entered the bedroom
there  his knees beside the bed
the mystery of the one-legged man

he found parkinjjton dead a knife
or some long sharp instrument had
been driven into his back
  what did you do then i asked
called rodgers the servant and
sent him off for the police
  you didnt rouse wonderly
no in the excitement i forgot all
about the fellow
  we entered the vicarage and raced
up the stairs to parkingtons room
there we found chief constable
smithers in charge and with him a
quiet looking man whom he intro-
duced as inspector grant of scotland
yard down for a bit of a holiday
sir and stopping with me
  but for the moment i paid but lit-
tle attention to smithers and his
friend i was too greatly upset by
the sight of the body i could make
out lying beside the bed my nat-
ural sorrow at parkingtons death
was added to by the awfulness of the
way in which he had been taken from
us i went over and stood beside his
body and looking down on it swore
that i would find his murderer and
see that he paid for his crime
  then i turned to smithers for his
report
  squire he began gravely what
i have to tell you will probably sur-
prise you you have heard of the
notorious peg-leg well sir there
is every indication that this is an-
other of his fiendish crimes
  both fellows and myself stared in
amazement smithers continued
  yes sir i know that it sounds im-
possible but nevertheless it seems to
be a fact inspector grant here who
worked on both the bascom case and
that of professor belding will bear
me out when i say that all the clues
we have been able to find point in
that direction
  inspector grant nodded his head
  smithers crossed the room and
stood midway between the bed and
an open window that looked out on
poor parkingtons lawn
  he pointed downward at the car-
pet
  see here sir tliose little round
marks-and here-and here-leading
right to the window sir and plenty
more of them on the ground below
accompanied by the print of one
shoe which does not show on this
carpet
  and those marks- i began
  theyre from a wooden leg
smithers finished
  but see here fellows cried from
beside the window how did the
beggar get in the house no man
with a wooden leg could climb up
here	
  smithers shook his head
  no good sir its really a very
easy job you have the hooks that
hold the drain pipe all the way both
grant and i tried it and had no
trouble at all
  have you tried to follow the
trail  i asked
  lor bless you yes sir we did
that at once but it leads nowhere
the prints are lost on the stone road
less than a hundred feet down the
highway
  we were all bending over those
horrible indentations in the carpet
when a sound at our backs caused us
to look up in the doorway clad in
his pajamas was captain wonderly
rubbing his eyes and yawning
  i say you chaps he said whats
up
  then he caught sight of parking-
tons body and started forward
  good heavens parkington  he
exclaimed whats wrong with
him is he hurt
  dead i answered briefly
  in a dazed sort of way wonderly
turned his eyes from one to another

the mystery of the one-legged man
of us at last they rested on smith-
ers and guided by the constables
uniform addressed him as the officer
of the law
  have you got the man that did
this
  not yet smithers replied and
now sir ill trouble you to tell me
who you are and what you know of
this business
  wonderly indicated fellows and
me
  these gentlemen know me he
said my names wonderly i was
a friend of dr parkington as for
what i know of this business-unfor-
tunately i cant help you a bit
  you were staying in the house
wonderly looked down significantly
at his night clothes
  i certainly was he answered in
that room across the hall
 and you heard nothing no
sound 
  an expression of sorrow-almost of
shame passed over wonderlys face
  if  only had he replied quietly
ill wager parkington would be-alive
now you see gentlemen some years
ago i lost the hearing in my right ear
this deficiency doesnt bother me ordi-
narily but if i happen to go to sleep
on my left ear as i did tonight im as
deaf as a post
  at my suggestion we went down-
stairs and seated ourselves in the li-
brary leaving the murder chamber and
its ghastly inhabitant untouched to
await the offices of the coroner but
hardly had we taken our chairs when
fellows jumped to his feet exclaiming
this sitting around when dr park-
ingtons murderer is making good his
escape is too much for me im going
to have a look around
  i put out my hand to stop him but
at a signal from smithers let it fall
  let him go he said after fellows
had left the room it wont do any
good but it wont do any harm and it
may ease the poor lad to be doing
something
  of course you have sent out a gen-
eral alarm i asked smithers a minute
later
  he nodded
  of course sir any one-legged
man seen hereabouts will find his way
to the police station
  then we began a careful consider-
ation of the crime each man suggest-
ing that which he thought might help
toward clearing it up and bringing
the criminal to justice
  in this consultation i conceived a
great admiration for captain won-
derly the man had an exceedingly
keen mind in competition with
smithers and inspector grant both
old hands in the pursuit of criminals
he showed up wonderfully no point
escaped him and several times he set
the others right in the development of
a theory or in the statement of facts
then and there i said to myself that
could i persuade wonderly to give up
his time to seeking the murderer of my
friend i might hope for some results
  i was about to put the suggestion to
him when we were all startled by the
sound of quick footsteps on the stairs
and along the hall an instant later
the library door swung wide and the
huge bulk of fellows filled the aper-
ture
  i caught my breath in amazement as
i saw the expression on his face his
eyes were wild with excitement and
about his lips were lines of grim deter-
mination
  without a word to the detectives or
me he crossed the room to wonderly
and bending over him whispered in his
right car
  a look of utter amazement came into
wondtrlys eyes this was quickly
followed by fear which in turn changed
to a sort of blind rage he strove to
the mystery of the one-legged man

rise but fellowss hand was about his
throat and held him tightly to his
chair
  then very slowly fellows brought
his other hand from behind his back
in it was a long knife and some queer
contrivance whose purpose i could not
make out he threw these things on
the table in front of wonderly
  smithers he said in a cold hard
voice i want you to arrest this man
for the murder of john elder sir
roger bascom professor belding and
dr parkington
ill
  what happened then happened so
quickly that we others had not the time
to pull ourselves together and go to
fellowss aid there was a brief strug-
gle between fellows and wonderly a
cry from the latter the tinkle of broken
glass on the floor and then suddenly
wonderlys body went limp in fellowss
hands
  poison fellows muttered bending
over the body of his late antagonist
the beggar had it in the pocket of his
dressing-gown
  he picked up a rug from the floor
and threw it over the body in front of
him
  now we all crowded around fellows
and burst into a babel of questions
he raised one hand to silence us and
with the other pointed at the queer con-
trivance which with the knife lay in
front of wonderlys corpse
  there he said is the wooden leg
of your peg-leg
  the thing was a piece of board cut in
the shape of the sole of a shoe from
the bottom projected a short round
stick tipped with an iron ferrule at
the front and back were straps by
which it might be fastened to a mans
foot only a brief examination of it
was needed to see how once so fastened
the prints the wearer would leave be-
hind him would certainly resemble
those of a one-legged man
  smithers was the first to break the
silence
  mr fellows he said i must con-
gratulate you you have laid by the
heels a man whom the best detectives
in england couldnt catch but i beg
of you sir tell us how you did it
  fellows sank into a chair
  all right he said it must be
sometime and i suppose it might as well
be now
  he drew a square leather-bound
book from his pocket
  but first he went on i want you
to listen to a few extracts from won-
derlys diary they will throw some
light on the mans motives for his das-
tardly crimes
  then in a low voice he read us the
following
  calcutta november -civilization again 
after five years of freedom to be cooped
up in this place of narrow streets and silly
houses i but if it is my destiny to carry on
the war among men of my own race i must
not begin by complaining
  i see none but strange faces on the streets
and in the clubs thanks to the gods the
men who knew me have gone their ways
the fools they despised me because my
eyes sought the light and when having
found it i followed it they said that i had
gone fantee
  how i could laugh at them now the
pretentious asses with their weak anaemic
gods thinking they know the secrets of life
i who have stood before the altar of siva
and watched the spilling of the blood  i who
have harkened to the angry voice of kali
would bid them halt and reconsider their
conceit lest the vengeance that is asias de-
scend upon them
   
  london-the message came today and it
is to kill-kill-kill 
  
  my birthday and i have begun the great
work john elder is dead even now the
police are searching for the one-legged man
who killed him one-legged i wonder if
the fools will ever see through my little
scheme for sending them hunting the wild
goose
  
  the good work continues bascom and
belding are gone the way of elder so may

the mystery of the one-legged man
all men go who lift their hands against the
holy gods
  fellows closed the book and threw it
aside
  a mad man i whispered
  a religious fanatic of the worst
type fellows answered i think i
can piece his story together he be-
came enamored with native life and
probably fell into the hands of the
priests or perhaps a woman led him
to the native shrines and their damn-
able religion got into his blood and
drove him mad
  smithers scratched his head
  but what made him kill
  because his victims were the ene-
mies of his religion all four of them
knew the evil practices of his cult
knew how his priests were holding
back the people of india with their
best efforts and their money here in
england they were fighting the battles
of their dark-skinned brothers thou-
sands of miles away
  now will you tell us how you found
this fellow out
  the question came from inspector
grant fellows nodded and began
  there was one thing that bothered
me from the time wonderly entered
the room upstairs and that was his
explanation for not hearing parking-
tons cry and the ensuing commotion
which i and the rest of us must have
made
  you remember he said that he was
totally deaf in the right ear that
would have been all right had i not
happened to remember that i sat on his
right side at dinner tonight and once
spoke to him in a voice barely above a
whisper in his right ear and he heard
perfectly
  my first idea was that the man was
a coward and had stayed in his room
because he had been afraid to come out
and see what all the noise was about
i	held to that opinion until we had come
downstairs and i left you to wander
about the garden
  when i went outside my first im-
pulse was to take a lantern and examine
the famous foot-prints i did so and
traced them as you did down to the
stone road then i came back to the
house and began to wander aimlessly
about the other side of it
  i ended up a few yards away from
wonderlys window happening to
glance downward i saw something that
sent the blood racing through my veins
there on the ground before me in a
soft spot on the gravel were another
set of foot-prints and these were of
a man with two legs wearing shoes
that seemed to correspond to the single
shoe worn by the man vwith one leg
  i raced around to the other side of
the house and verified my suspicion
then i went back to my find
  i took the direction the prints
pointed out and followed it slowly my
lantern close to the ground a ways
farther on i found another set of prints
and so on crery little while i found
them until i had made a wide detour
and was out on the stone road where
the murderers prints began and ended
  at first i did not realize the signifi-
cance of what i had discovered then
it suddenly came to me that a man
could easily leave the foot-prints of a
one-legged man if in walking he used
a stilt or some such device also i
recalled that the new prints had begun
at wonderleys window then i knew
why he hadnt joined us in parking-
tons roofn sooner it was because he
was probably in hiding somewhere at
the other side of the house waiting for
a chance to slip back into his room
after having murdered my friend and
left those bewildering prints
  i came back to the house crept up-
stairs and went through his things
you know what i found and what hap-
pened after that
hear not see not speak
not evil
by walter deffenbaugh
i
the opaque light through the
drawn shade of the library win-
dow alone marked the location
of the big house surrounded by
flower-dotted-lawns half a mile away
twinkled the few midnight lamps of the
village an occasional belated motor
car flashed as a meteor through the
night a flash and a rumble from over
the hill marked the passing of a trolley-
car on its way to the city
  at night it was a particularly lone-
some spot but this did not seem to
bother in the least dr darius y por-
ter wealth and famous specialist in
diseases of the eye ear and throat as
he strolled leisurely homeward after
dinner and bridge with a neighbor
  his eyes were turned toward the
light he had left burning on his read-
ing table as a bearing in his search for
the small side gate when another light
flashed on at an upper window he
immediately located this as the chamber
of old martha his housekeeper who
had come to him as a sort of charity
patient and remained because she had
proved invaluable during the progress
of her cure of deafness
  up rather late he mused as he
glanced upward and then halted in his
tracks because there was thrust up-
ward as though from the bottom of a
screen in a motion picture the shadow
of a hand-a hand with the fingers
rapidly working in the code of the
deaf and dumb
  help burglars help was the
message he read from the frantic fin-
gers as they spelled out in the code he
had taught her a message of appeal
plainly destined for his eye in case
he should be returning along the
road
  fumbling hurriedly along the high
hedge he found his gate and was un-
latching it when to his amazement
shadows appeared upon the curtain of
the library window-and these too
showed fingers working in the silent
code-fingers attached to rather dim
figures-figures of two or perhaps
three men-figures that waved back
and forth and fingers upon arms which
seemed to gesticulate as though to em-
phasize a soundless argument
  porters nerves had been steeled by
years in hospitals his muscles tautened
by years of semi-retirement upon his
country estate his gate was flung open
as he looked and he bounded up the
gravel path to the side veranda of his
home to attack these intruders with his
bare hands
  his surprise attack was balked by the
darkness running by instinct he fell
sprawling over a chair old martha had
been using for an after-dinner reverie
beneath the vines that covered the
porch and chair and physician fell to-
gether in a resounding crash he was
up in a second and had his key in the
lock of the side door but already he
could hear voices inside and the sound
of hurried retreat
  quick beat it shouted one voice


hear not see not speak not evil
  help me dan damn you whined
another
 let go my coat you - -
--he heard one say amid the noise
of running feet and overturned furni-
ture while old martha screamed lustily
from her now opened window
  abandoning this attack porter leaped
from the verands and ran to the front
of the house he was beginning to be-
lieve he could make out something mov-
ing against a sky-line formed by a rise
of ground-something that looked like
two running men one almost dragging
the other-when he bumped full tilt
into what was undoubtedly a man hud-
dled in a clump of rose bushes with
his back toward him and facing the
main entrance to the grounds
  the impact knocked the doctor from
his feet and before he could recover
the man was running across the lawn
as porter staggered up a shot fanned
the hair along the side of his head and
philosophically he turned back into his
open front door with his thoughts about
equally divided between the screams of
his housekeeper and the safety of a
pearl necklace in his safe-a treasure
of which he was trustee-a wedding
gift for his daughter from her dead
mother when the time should come
  a shouted word up the stairs quieted
the screams but mahy unprofessional
oaths failed to alter the scene as he
looked into his library where the door
of the safe stood open with its con-
tents scattered about on the floor the
case in which his wifes nccklace had
rested undisturbed for ten years was
upside down on the library table
empty-a quick glance showed but
something crunched under his foot as
he moved and sweat that the thieves had
not started broke out on his forehead as
he turned on more lights and retrieved
the fragments of a pearl
  standing in his tracks then cautious-
ly kneeling and creeping he searched
with eyes and fingers until he had found
eleven more waving back and silencing
the moaning old woman who wavered
in the doorway twelve that accounted
for-twelve out of thirty-six they
had got twenty-four of them then the
scoundrels he decided well he should
have them back-have them if it took
all his time and his life besides he
was something of a sentimentalist this
doctor for all his calm exterior a
sentimentalist with a touch of the mas-
terful and stubborn
  with a sigh he arose to his feet
took up his telephone and called the
village police he had not stopped to
question martha until then as he
thought she knew nothing she had
been suddenly vaguely disturbed she
had listened and heard sounds down-
stairs-voices that were those of
strangers then an oath and noise of a
quarrel afraid to shout she had re-
called the code of her days of deafness
and acted upon an impulse to try to
signal her master in case he should be
coming along the road
  there was no help there neither
was there in the weighty theories
offered by the village police sergeant
upon his tumultuous arrival upon the
scene a few minutes later dr porter
was glad when they were all gone and
he was able to light his pipe and sink
into his easy chair with his feet resting
carefully amid the scattered contents
of his safe which still littered the
floor
  daylight for which he had waited
came just about the time he was
read for it he had said nothing to
the village sergeant about the talking
fingers but he had spent the night
thinking about them and also about the
crouching figure into whose heedless
back he had crashed he had reached
two conclusions bom of his long ob-
servance of defective mankind one
of the men who had robbed him was
hear not see not speak not evil

dumb there had been an argument
and those who could had not hesitated
to use their voices martha testified to
that therefore there was one who
could not speak but was still deter-
mined to have his say
  the man in the bushes he decided
was stone deaf sensing danger when
the others took to their heels there had
been no sound to warn him of the direc-
tion of the danger therefore he
crouched in the bushes with his eyes to
the main gate waiting for a glimpse of
his peril the sudden start of the thief
which he felt rather than saw as he
collided with him showed that the man
had not even heard his running pursuit
or his shouts calling rather foolishly
upon the burglars to halt
  so far so good he had decided but
what of the third man-of that figure
that seemed to drag behind another at
his last glimpse of them therefore he
welcomed the daylight
  the mode of entrance had been sim-
ple-a jimmy applied to one of the win-
dows opening on the front veranda
apparently the thieves were familiar
with the house and the habits of the
family knew that his chauffeur had
taken his daughter away in his car to
spend the summer with relatives ind
that the master being out for the eve-
ning old martha would be alone in the
mansion naturally they had unlocked
the front door from the inside and their
escape had been equally simple
  the well-kept lawns and graveled
walks and drives revealed no sign of
footprints even in the clump of rose
bushes where he had fallen there were
only a few marks of knees heels and
toes to mark the brief encounter the
deaf man apparently had run from
there straight across the lawn to the
main highway and vaulted the stone
wall but the other two had run at a
tangent over the rising ground beyond
which lay his vegetable garden per-
haps there was something to be found
there
  a detective might never have read
the signs beyond the little hill but to
the physician they were as plain as if
he had seen what had happened just
over the brow the slighter growth of
grass had been tom as one of the men
stumbled and fell more than that
there were signs of a struggle between
them and marks as though the rear-
ward of the two was being dragged
along with his toes scraping up the soil
just beyond was a bit of cloth which
proved to be the cleanly ripped off patch
pocket of a cheap coat
  beyond that the track divided one
man had run straight and true across
the tilled vegetable garden to the board
fence beyond and apparently made his
way to the trolley line but the oilier
had blundered about crashing into
trees fences and shrubbery and then
run in a zigzag fashion tumbled into a
cress pond and finally crashed through
a board fence and fallen sprawling in
a lane
  crazed by fright a trained detec-
tive might have said
  the third man is blind stated the
doctor as he turned back to his library
  a careful search of the floor by day-
light revealed no more of the pearls a
check of the remnant showed that the
siring had broken scattering their
nfatched treasures and it seemed prob-
able that the thieves in a hasty search
had found only the largest as though
they had groped for them by the touch
of their hands sadly dr porter
placed the rifled case in his pocket
gathered up his scattered papers locked
his expertly opened safe and started
by trolley for the city
  on the way in he heard several things
that interested him but kept ilfs own
counsel he had fully decided upon
his plan which had for its object the
recovery of the pearls rather than the

hear not see not speak not evil
punishment of the thieves that could
come later he had formulated a plan
which was based upon medical rather
than detective science he smiled grim-
ly as he heard the gossip in the village
where the news of the robbery was not
yet known corner loiterers were dis-
cussing the strange case of a blind
man who had appeared at daybreak
scratched and bruised and with a
broken cane who told a tale of having
been separated from his companion and
forced to spend the night in the fields
from this rambling and conflicting gos-
sip he managed to gain a sort of de-
scription of the man-rather a stout
unkempt kind of fellow it seemed
wearing blue goggles and a short heavy
beard sprinkled with gray
  there was other talk of a second
stranger who had passed through the
village twice on trolley cars seemingly
somewhat bewildered as to his where-
abouts who listened attentively to what
was said in his hearing but refused to
answer any questions as to where he
was going or wanted to go some said
he was a foreigner who couldnt un-
derstand english others that he was
merely one of those sullen fellows who
never can be sociable
  of him too there were meagre de-
scriptions-slight about thirty smooth-
shaven dressed in a cheap suit with one
pocket ripped from the side of the coat
and the back of one hand scratched as
though by thorns or finger-nails
  the trail plainly led to the city and
there dr porter followed it with his
eye cocked for a blind man with blue
goggles and a beard in a crowded
city he fully realized a deaf man can
hide his lack of hearing a dumb man
his inability to speak but a blind man
cannot disguise his lack of sight
  this must be a case of the blind lead-
ing the blind if he could locate the
man with the blue goggles he felt sure
he could find the others and through
one of them his pearls determinedly
he made his way to the poorer lodging-
house section of the city where his ex-
perience told him a blind man of this
type especially one separated from his
pals would be most likely to be found
of course he might be holed-up but
that seemed improbable no one had
seen him in the house and who would
suspect a blind man of being a burglar
even though he had been seen in the
vicinity of a crime
  nevertheless the first days search
was fruitless there were scores of
blind men but not the blind man-blind
men of all sorts but not one showing
signs of the brand of viciousness that
would lead him into safe-robbery-
many blind men who were not blind
but the man he sought really was blind
he knew
  toward evening he decided that if it
were to be a long hunt he must have
headquarters on the spot and found
one ready-made for him at a free dis-
pensary in the neighborhood he was
gladly granted permission to open a pri-
vate charity clinic for the treatment of
those specialties in which he was fa-
mous his explanation that he was
looking for material for a series of new
experiments was readily accepted and
a private office with sleeping room at-
tached speedily cleared for the distin-
guished physician to it he brought
down from his home some personal be-
longings bedding and a few decora-
tions including two or three chinese
and japanese bronzes that were one
of his hobbies
ii
  it was along about noon on the sec-
ond day after that the series of events
his logic demanded began to shape
themselves a tattered boy emerged
from a lodging house leading an almost
burly figure in beard and blue goggles
who tapped ahead of him with a long
hear not see not speak not evil

cane about his neck were suspended
the regulation tin cup and placard read-
ing please help the blind with
almost a lump in his throat porter fol-
lowed die pair across to one of the busy
business streets where the boy left his
charge against the iron railing of a
graveyard and darted away porter
took up his stand nearby to await de-
velopments
  these were not long in coming
coins for the cup were few the figure
was a trifle too burly and the expression
a trifle too belligerent to awaken pity
in many hearts among the hurrying
throng but finally a man appeared who
deliberately halted and searched his
pockets for a coin porter observed
him carefully he had noticed him as
he crossed the street the normal
man jumps when an automobile horn
honks just behind him this man had
not even started he was a tall man
slightly stooped smooth-shaven with a
long pointed jaw and wheu he spoke
to the blind beggar it was in a low
monotone which porter could not catch
even though he edged closer in the
effort
  neither could he hear the beggars
reply-but he could read it for the
blind man answered with his fingers
with his hand held high almost under
the others nose-answered emphati-
cally and with warmth which swept
beyond the limits of the silent code and
required spoken oaths to express his
feelings
  porters hands gripped the railing
behind him as he stood tense a few
yards away from the strangely quarrel-
ing pair
  whered i go shouted the fingers
whatd you care where i went you
left me with that damn dummy didnt
you you left me with him so he
could ditch me didnt have the heart
to throw down an old pal like that your-
self whered you go thats what i
want to know whered you go and
wheres my share of them pearls
  the deaf man apparently replied at
some length but without changing his
tone or position he stood as though
interested in some charitable quest but
his explanation fell upon ears as deaf
as his own it was discarded with a
gesture of angry scorn
  to hell with that tale the fingers
declaimed i may be blind but i can
hear and i can feel didnt i hear and
feel you and dummy picking them
pearls up off the floor when the string
broke just before the blow-off what
chance had i to find any and you try
to tell me dummy got em all tell that
to any old con and see if hell believe
you you crossed me-the pair of you
-thats what you did deafy i didnt
expect much different from dummy
hes a gaycat anyway but you-why
didnt i forgive you whfl you put my
lamps out getting funny with that soup
i forgave you that because you was a
pal and because you lost your hearing
at the same time and now you cross
a blind man
  they kept it up for two or three min-
utes more but there was too much at
stake for porter to risk observance by
the alert deaf man and he lost himself
in the crowd until they should finish
over his shoulder he read the blind
mans parting shot
  dont forget it neither the fingers
spelled you have dummy here to-
morrow or ill snitch on you as sure-
  the fingers were still working as
the deaf man darted away unseen
and porter turned in his tracks to
foljow
  he knew where the blind man lived
and did not need to worry about him
blind men usually travel neither far
nor fast so he trailed the deaf man to
a small hotel half-way uptown and
watched long enough to make sure he
lived there before he returned to his
	hear not see not speak not evil
neglected clinic and a pipe to aid him in
piecing together his new information
  two old crooks eh he ruminated
when his work was done two old pals
injured in a premature explosion while
cracking a safe remarkable most re-
markable and the dumb man-who
is he  where does he enter the combi-
nation  it was quite a while before the
answer occurred to him and when it
did he almost chuckled at the picture
presented
  ideal he muttered aloud ideal
an ideal combination among men so
vicious they cannot even trust each
other one man cant see another cant
hear and the third cant speak no one
of them competent to act alone the
combination is ideal but i wonder how
the dumb man talks to the blind man
and puzzling over this he cast a queer
glance at one of his bronzes and went
to bed to wait for the promised meet-
ing on the morrow
  it was a long dreary wait as he paced
back and forth about the blind mans
post first on one side of the street and
then on the other but finally he made
out the tall form of the deaf crook
crossing the street in the same careless
fashion as before to the evident dis-
tress of a slighter shorter man who
tugged at his arm in efforts to trans-
mit the warnings of traffic peril the
watching physician had identified
dummy even before he was close
enough to show that his right-hand coat
pocket was missing
  deafy and dummy halted before
goggles and again the pretense of
searching pockets for coins was gone
through with apparently there was
some brief word from the taller of the
pair because the blind man stiffened in
anger and began to speak rapidly
deafy lingered for a moment and then
with an impatient toss of his head
stepped away from a conversation he
could not hear and glared suspiciously
at the pair from a position on the
curb
  it was dangerous for porter to at-
tempt to overhear what the blind man
was saying anyway he knew from
the conversation of the day before just
about what it would be but curiosity
held him for a minutes risk lie
wanted to see how the dumb man
would reply the finger code would be
useless before sightless eyes and he was
sure the man really could not speak
  the passers-by undoubtedly noticed
nothing unusual but the expert in hu-
man disabilities saw it in a glance and
scolded himself for having even puzzled
over the method it was no miracle
but most unusual except among those
long in intimate association it was re-
markable because these men were ap-
parently comparative strangers
  dummy merely placed his hand over
that of goggles who held it out for
him and pressed tapped and squeezed
in the code such as is used by miss
helen keller and her mentor the
physician understood at once but was
amazed at what he saw how could
these two men become adept at this in-
tricate system with but apparently a
very short opportunity for practice
undoubtedly the usual method of com-
munication among the trio was by
words from the deaf man to either the
blind or the dumb by words from the
blind man to the dumb man and by
fingers from the blind man to the deaf
man by fingers from the dumb man to
the deaf man and through him to the
blind man by words their whole as-
sociation seemed built up on the neces-
sity of the three being together when
they conferred with any ease and hcnce
he wondered at this apparent profi-
ciency in an unusual code
  at length while he waited at a safe
distance for the conversation to end he
recalled something in his experience
which solved the problem these men
hear not see jnot speak not evil

were undoubtedly all ex-convicts
among the long-term men in some
prisons he remembered this very sys-
tem had been developed among some
of the most desperate as a means of
secret communication where speech
was forbidden and the finger code
would have been instantly detected
along the eating tables in the work-
shops or in the marching lines of
prisoners a hand could grasp a hand
and a brief message be exchanged
among the initiated he had heard
vaguely that outside there was a regu-
ular school where the system was taught
those who feared that some day they
might have need for it either to send
or receive a message he understood
  it was a dangerous place for a
lengthy conversation between two men
such as these even under the best of
circumstances but the anger in the
hearts of these two made it doubly dan-
gerous the deaf man watched un-
easily and hovered near with one eye
on his quarreling companions and the
other searching the crowd for detec-
tivus porter saw the dumb man throw
the others hand from him with a vio-
lent gesture and as the blind man
raised his cane to strike the deaf man
darted forward caught dummy by the
arm and whirled him away in tbe crowd
with a low-voiced curse at the man in
goggles
  porter followed the pair and made
sure of locating the lair of the third of
his despoilers it was in a hotel of
shabby appearance and unsavory repu-
tation far uptown that the dumb man
lived a few hours of cautious in-
quiries and guarded listening served to
reveal something of his character
dummy he found was also a profes-
sional beggar-at times at least he
was one of those furtive individuals
who seeks alms with printed cards or
with pad and pencil usually he pre-
tended to be deaf as well as dumb but
his hearing was most acute when his
own character was under discussion
and his vengeful vicious nature showed
itself strongly especially when he was
in his cups which was as often as pos-
sible at such times he turned upon
gossipers with strange guttural noises
and cries which showed that he had
well-developed vocal cords even if
they were out of control
  dr porter had found his pearl
thieves but that was not the object
of his quest he wanted his pearls
  his next step had already been
mapped out the rape of his wifes
necklace had hurt him far more than
the threatened monetary loss he could
buy other pearls without reckoning the
cost but money would not replace these
particular pearls the mere turning
over of these men to the police and
seeing them sent to prison would not
satisfy him therefore he did not seek
the police and trust to arrests and third-
degree methods instead he called a
taxi and drove to the office of young
dr henry b robertson who had been
one of his assistants until he had hung
out his own shingle a few months be-
fore and was still his devoted slave
  to robertson porter quickly out-
lined the story upon two prescription
blanks he wrote two names addresses
and descriptions
  harry he said one of these men
is deaf and the other dumb both of
them are dangerous criminals suspi-
cious of everyone and remarkably cun-
ning i must have each one of them in
my hands alone as speedily as possible
i am trusting to your wits you must
manage in some way to become ac-
quainted with these men introduce
yourself as the specialist you are and
then call me in dont use my name of
course if properly approached both
of these men would jump at a chance
to be cured promise them you can do
it harry and ill do the rest ill
	hear not see not speak not evil
allow you about a week on each case
but hurry
ill
  porter left his eager young ex-
assistant already changing to a street
coat and drove to the office of a private
detective agency noted for its faithful-
ness to its clients and its utter lack of
curiosity here he quietly arranged to
have the two men shadowed day and
night with immediate reports to him of
anything unusual
  his trap was ready to be baited
  robertson lie felt sure would bring
the deaf and dumb man to him he
had decided to handle the blind man
himself because here he felt sure was
the weakest side of the triangle the
blind man more helpless than either of
the others was burning with desire to
avenge what he believed to have been
a deliberate attempt to abandon him
and cheat him out of the proceeds of
the joint enterprise
  it was best he decided in this case
to strike quickly and directly but he
did not go again to the station by the
graveyard railing instead he loitered
in the vicinity of the lodging-house un-
til after the evening crowds had de-
serted the streets the tattered boy ap-
peared with his charge in tow leading
homeward a bitter cursing blind man
  excuse me said dr porter resist-
ing a temptation to seize the man by
the throat and choke a confession out of
him but i am a physician i am mak-
ing a study of blindness perhaps i
might be able to help you if you would
let me
  i aint got no money to pay doc-
tors goggles replied bitterly
  it isnt a matter of money porter
answered i tell you i am studying
the various forms of blindness i have
opened a clinic at the dispensary around
the corner we make no charge to
those who have no money to pay
  could you give me back my eyes
the blind man asked eagerly
  perhaps how did you lose your
sight
  explosion
  powder factory
  something like that
  how long ago
  two years come august
  that is most interesting i think i
can do something for you can you be
at my clinic at  in the morning ask
for me my name is dr moore
you think theres a chance i could
see again the blind man asked after
a full minutes study i could pay
well if i could get my eyes back
you mean you could work and earn
the money then
  i wouldnt have to earn it its
coming to me i mean i could catch
the-that gyped me out of my share
of the-well out of my rights
  youll come then porter asked
almost too eagerly he feared
  yes ill be there
  one of the quarry had smelled the
bait
  two days later young dr robertson
was having a similar conversation with
a man to whom he talked on his fingers
and who answered in a low monotone
here too was a man who finally ad-
mitted a great desire to regain one of
his lost senses this man did not seek
vengeance but expressed a fear that
through his disability certain enemies
were plotting against him he was in-
tensely anxious to hear what was going
on around him and promised payment
for a cure-not in money but in the
form of a handsome present of jewelry
  in the course of the following week
another derelict had confessed to dr
robertson that he might be able to raise
money for a goodly reward in case his
speech was restored he had no money
he confessed but could realize on some
valuable property he owned if he could
hear not see not speak not evil

  only talk about it like other men being
  dumb he was at a great disadvantage
  and also he would like to tell a couple
 of - exactly what he thought of
  them in plain words this ii itself he
  declared profanely would be worth a
  great deal to him
   each of the three men had stipu-
 lated that there should be no publicity
 about the cases no one was to know
 they were under treatment they each
 announced a great desire to surprise
 their friends and insisted upon ar-
 rangements for their visits at hours
 when they would not be seen by other
 patients to these stipulations drs
 robertson and porter finally agreed as
 a special concession although dr por-
 ter knocked what little professional dig-
 nity dr robertson had been able to
 acquire completely out of him as he
  slapped him on the back in token of
 great and complete satisfaction
iv
   on each of the three cases dr
  moore worked patiently and pains-
 takingly he soon lost all fear of de-
 tection as the man whose house had
 been robbed if the three crooks re-
 membered the name of their victim it
 was apparently only as some doctor
 and there were thousands of doctors
 all of his expert training in his profes-
 sion he applied to the work of really
 restoring these three men to the full
 use of their faculties and all of the skill
 in reading human character gleaned
 from his long years of practice he de-
 voted to extracting and piecing together
 their secrets he worked as physician
 and psychologist combined
   both processes were tedious but
 combined required only a couple of
 weeks altogether after the men had
 fully surrendered their confidence to
 him and his energetic young assistant
 who in the casual conversational man-
  ner of the competent physician did
  most of the real questioning that
  they learned anything like all of the
  truth neither of them believed for a
  moment that all they did learn was
  true was another premise they re-
  jected but trying and testing each
  statement gleaned comparing and
  matching it to others to see if it fitted
  and putting the whole jig-saw puzzle
  together they felt that they had at least
  the framework of a section of the lives
  of these three crooks and the clue to
  their strange association
  as dr porter had originally de-
duced the three were ex-convicts
deafy and goggles had been friends
for years and went to sing sing for
the same burglary at that time both
men were in full possession of their
senses they had become acquainted
with dummy sentenced for some petty
crime while in prison-attracted to him
by his infirmity which lent a sort of
morbid diversion to a drab existence
through this association they perfected
their knowledge of the silent codes of
which they already had a smattering
and formed a friendship with a prom-
ise of an offensive and defensive alli-
ance when they should be again
outside
  the release of goggles and deafy
came first and they at once set about
making up for lost time forgetting their
silent pal victim of an attack of scarlet
fever after the manner of their kind
goggles was a wonder with safes he
could open almost any of them it
seems by merely listening to the click
of the tumblers as he turned the knob
of the combination deafy was sup-
posed to be the soup expert-the man
who used a drill and a bottle of nitro-
glycerine upon such boxes as resisted
the skill of his companion
  they had a most prosperous time of
it for a month or two haffling the po-
lice obtaining their fill of adventure

hear not see not speak not evil
and lining their pockets-all three satis-
factions at one time
  dummy was released about this time
and speedily hunted up his old friends
pie was broke morose desperate and
vengeful they did not like him as a
pal half so much as they thought they
would back there in the big lonely
prison perhaps it was because dummy
did not measure up to real yegg stand-
ards but the dumb man had de-
clared himself in on two or three of
their jobs and thereafter it was sort of
a game of hide and seek they dodged
him whenever they could and accepted
him as a partner when they couldnt
help it
  one night when deafy and goggles
were working alone something had hap-
pened the sale had resisted the skill
of the silent worker and the drill and
the soup had been called upon to finish
the job just what happened neither
of them knew but there had been a
roar and a blinding flash and a deaf
man had dragged a blind man from a
wrecked office to safety
  the pearl robbery had been of a
later era-of a time after the two men
had recovered as much as they could
from the effects of the explosion
broken by their disaster physically and
financially to them in this condition
the dumb man had really seemed a link
with the world to one he provided
ears to the the other he gave eyes he
would help a lot they thought at first
  but the days of big jobs seemed to
be over dummy was still a petty thief
at heart and for a time the two real
crooks had no stomach for daring ad-
venture in the course of their pica-
yunish pilfering they also learned that
dummy was not a man to be trusted
deafy had seen him cheat the blind
man and without knowing the reason
goggles had heard the deaf man give
information which sent dummy to the
workhouse for a brief bit that was
the beginning of the disruption of what
little of mutual honor had ever existed
among these three thieves thereafter
the combination conceived as a protec-
tion against society contracted into a
closer and sullen trinity for protection
against each other
  there were holes in the piecemeal
story about this period-times when
each of the men was strangely silent
and grim about what had occurred
something had happened what it was
neither of the physicians could find out
though they worked as skilfully with
their wits as with their scalpels
  the attack upon dr porters safe
was commonplace enough save for the
personalities of the burglars themselves
when the facts were known the
pearls had been located in the usual
way by a servant girl known to the
dumb man through some queer chan-
nel she had reported the make and
location of the safe the plan of the
house and the habits of the household
she had been dismissed a few days
before the departure of the doctors
daughter all would have been plain
sailing but for the delay of old martha
in going to sleep
  as for the location of the stolen
pearls themselves that was not quite so
easy an inept or too direct lead or
question along this line might have
caused alarm which would have spoiled
everything hating one another as
these three crooks undoubtedly did
they were still subjects of the code
enough to have given a warning cry if
they detected danger
  so the pearls themselves were still
somewhat in the realm of deductive
facts although porter felt certain of
his ground he felt sure that the blind
man had none the deaf man a few and
the dumb man the bulk of them so
certain was he of his ground that he
sprang his trap on that basis
  the two private detectives a police

hear not see not speak not evil
lieutenant of detectives and a stenog-
rapher were concealed in dr robert-
sons offices that night the two physi-
cians had brazenly broken their promise
of secrecy to their three patients each
had been ordered to report at a fixed
time and so firm now was their faith
in the wonder-working specialists that
they obeyed without doubt or ques-
tion
v
  the deaf man was the first to arrive
as he entered the room dr porter was
seated at a table toying with the rem-
nant of his dead wifes necklace the
sight of it startled the thief but he
recovered himself and took a seat in
front of the doctor porter laid aside
the pearls and turned to the man with
his best professional air
  how are you feeling mason he
asked
  deafy cupped one hand at his right
ear as the doctor spoke but answered
the question readily
  fine sir he answered with a
grin but hearing a whole lot better
thanks to you
  thats good but you neednt thank
me theres usually a good reason for
anything a physician does very often
he profits even more than the patient
all you have to do now is to take care
of yourself and lead a regular life i
think it would be best for you to keep
out of the open air
  with a queer smile porter again
picked his pearls
  deafy hesitated a moment then
coughed apologetically
  you seem interested in pearls he
said finally
  why yes rather porter replied
this is a small string belonging to a
friend of mine who left them with me
to see if i could find some others to
match them
  again the thief hesitated and stam-
mered a bit when he spoke
  you remember doctor he said i
told you i should like to make you a
little present of jewelry if i was cured
its funny but its some old pearls ive
had a long time i was going to give you
here they are if you will take them
maybe theyd match those of your
friends and he laid six of the porter
treasures on the table
  the doctors hands trembled as he
picked them up and examined them but
he managed to make some expression
of thanks while he quickly strung them
into their places with the others he
started to speak but the doorbell rang
and with an injunction to deafy to re-
main where he was he stepped into an
adjoining room and closed the door
  it was the dumb man this time who
was the opposite figure in a scene much
like the one just enacted-a dumb man
voluble in his thanks for the miracle
of his cure he too spoke for pay-
ment
  why yes said dr porter finally
i believe you did say something to
dr robertson about paying a fee in
case a cure would enable you to realize
upon some valuable property you hold
what sort of property is it if i may
ask perhaps i might assist you
  well you see sir its some pearls
the dumb man said these here pearls
	cant talk very good yet from being so
long out of practice so if you could
take these and get me the money on
them id be only too glad to divide with
you and he laid eighteen of the porter
pearls on the table
  its a strange thing said the physi-
cian but i do know just where to
place these pearls well talk about the
division of profit later
  before the amazed eyes of the fhief
he drew the growing necklace from his
pocket and began to replace the missing
half of it
hear not see not speak not evil

 what-where-how- spluttered
dummy then the door opened and
dr robertson ushered deafy into the
room
  for a second the two men glared at
each other too amazed to speak then
a frown gathered like a storm on the
brows of deafy and he advanced threat-
eningly toward the table upon which
lay the pearls
  you snitch he growled struggling
to raise his voice beyond its usual mono-
tone doc this sneak here stole these
pearls i bought part of them from
him and i-
  you lie screamed dummy you
stole them yourself out at that doctors
house
 dont you believe him doc
growled deafy and then the two fell
back in amazement silenced by the dis-
covery that one was talking and the
other hearing what was said
  the door opened again this time
the young physician led into the room
a bulky man with a beard and ban-
daged eyes at whom the other two
stared not so much in surprise as in
threatening understanding between
the two-the once deaf and the once
dumb-there passed a look which
offered and accepted a new defensive
alliance of two against one
  mr clark said dr porter there
seems to be a difference of opinion
here do you know these two gentle-
men 
  at the question goggles lifted the
bandage from his eyes blinked a little
at the light then opened his mouth in
consternation at the two men he saw-
glowering at him before he could
speak his new-found eyes caught the
pearls the physician was still stringing
  know them he shouted yes i
know the yrrooks-the double thieves
they stole these pearls and then they
stole them from me-stole the share of
a poor helpless blind man but i can see
now and ill see you in prison again
  dummy whipped out a knife and
sprang for goggles but before he could
reach him curtains parted and he was
seized by the police lieutenant while the
room seemed to fill with men
  the games up growled deafy
but hes in it too he opened doc
porters safe himself
  so youd snitch on an old pal as
well as rob him would you cried
goggles and you dummy you little
rat that i tried to be a friend to youd
knife me would you well ill tell
and ill tell good they may send me
back to stir but youll go to the chair
hold him you fellows youve got the
man that killed the grocer in that bur-
glary last winter
  shut up you fool called deafy
  no i wont shut up you were in
it too but i wasnt i wasnt and
ive got you two where you belong
  the big body sagged at the knees and
crumpled on the floor as the man sobbed
hysterically
  dr porter had finished stringing his
pearls and held the restored necklace
up to the light with a sigh of satis-
faction he placed it in the case he
took from his pocket and laid it on the
table turning he pointed to a piece
of bronze that stood on the mantel shelf
  gentlemen he said i wish you
would all look at this it has a lesson
for thieves detectives physicians and
everyone else it is a japanese piece
called the sacred monkeys there are
three of them one holds his hands
over his ears a second over his eyes
and the third over his mouth the in-
scription beneath reads hear not see
not speak not evil i took the restrain-
ing hands away from the ears eyes and
mouth of these three men here you
see the result
  dr porter picked up his jewel case
from the table lighted a cigarette and
walked from the room
he sidestepped me as i rushed and grabbed vie from behind-page 

  fear
by pettersen marzoni
i
hartley brentwood of
barnes brentwood and com-
pany was found in his apartment
at  oclock in the morning with
a bullet wound in his head and a half-
smoked cigarette in his fingers
  yes i killed him john barnes
senior member of the firm told inspec-
tor thorne of the police department
three hours later when that officer found
him at his country place i am ready
to go with you
  the tragedy had shocked the world
of finance and society barnes and
brentwood were the only members of
the firm of barnes brentwood and com-
pany bankers which controlled the des-
tinies of half the countrys indus-
tries for fifteen years they had been
business associates and leaders in
finance
  barnes had made no attempt to avoid
arrest-none even to hide his crime
an elevator boy had seen him leave
brentwoods apartment late the night
before the shot apparently had not
been heard because brentwoods body
had not been discovered until that morn-
ing by his valet
  why did you do it thorne asked
the banker the usual question but he did
it with unusual interest he had been
searching for a motive on his way out
but he could vision none
  they were on the train then return-
ing to new york barnes offered to
use one of his cars for the short ride
but thorne was afraid to take a chance
in spite of his apparent submission
before barnes answered he looked
toward the gleam of metal under his
sleeves where the handcuffs showed
  would you mind holding a cigar
for me inspector
  thorne looked at him a moment then
leaned over and unlocked the cuffs
  its a long story barnes began
with a sigh of relief as he drew deep
on his cigar
ii
 fifteen years ago my firm was
landis and barnes we were bankers
and brokers of the old school at least
landis was conservative more con-
servative than there was any need for
we had a safe business but there was
nothing in it when i had started in
as a clerk for old man landis my one
ambition had been to get in the firm
he was a leader then and he looked like
he had a grip on the world but when
i did arrive i saw it was only a
beginning
  landis wasnt really old physically
but his ideas were old younger men
all around him had passed him in the
race for money he really didnt care
an awful lot about making money i
liked him but i had to get ahead it
was just born in me however he con-
trolled the business and poohpoohed
every real idea i brought to him
  we went right on making money his
way but it wasnt my way i knew it
was the time to cut loose for big things
and i started planning on them i
couldnt leave landis because i needed
his help for a while
  just about that time brentwood came
to work for me i had insisted on a


fear
private secretary landis never could
see the need of one  even had trouble
persuading him to hire enough stenog-
raphers he wasnt tight-he just
couldnt see the need of them but i
insisted on the secretary idea i needed
one it wasnt a question of style so
brentwood came in with me from the
main office
  you know what he looked like re-
cently then he was only about  and
he was handsome he had played foot-
ball at college-fenced to i believe
he showed the results of both in his size
and manner he was one of those men
who look like statues or models for
clothes advertisements i believe that
was one reason i took him i didnt go
to college myself didnt have time-
had to make money
  brentwood was always well-dressed
he wasnt making much but i believe
he had a small income from some money
an aunt had left him besides that i
hadnt heard then of any vices he had
of course he took a drink now and then
and he smoked but no one ever called
him a spendthrift he had a social posi-
tion- i didnt-and he went places then
i couldnt get in i never wanted to
dont get the idea i was jealous about
that
  i got everything in the world i
wanted even if i did have to pay for
them i wanted money because money
was power and power was my dream
i have both at least i had them until
last night
  whatever had made me bring brent-
wood into my office as private secretary
he justified my choice before he had
been with me a week he started right
in taking minor details off my hands
i had more time for getting some of
my big plans straightened out
  but the size of my plans didnt help
me any landis was a fool if we
made six per cent he was satisfied if
we made eight he thought we were
beginning to speculate and if we made
ten which happened as often as he let
me have my way he thought it was il-
legal i wonder what the old man would
say if he had lived until now
  i wasnt going to be tied down to a
rock like that and by the time brent-
wood had been with me a year i had
too much time on my hands to stand it
any longer then i hit on the scheme
  i would have preferred to do it with
landis he had been good to me but
what i had in mind i couldnt even talk
to him about he would have fixed it so
i couldnt get in with anyone else i
needed his money and other things he
had they made the thing possible so
i went after someone else
  even though landis wouldnt listen
other firms had been getting a line on
me whenever the firm put over any-
thing big they all i knew i did it
 you remember old tom king
crooked as a snake hut he knew how
to make money i had met him at lunch
once or twice but he had kept track of
me i knew from things he said he
never ate anything but crackers and
milk he saw me order the same one
day so he took more interest in me i
thought he would
 when i decided it was time to put
over my scheme i picked out king for
the second man it took two of us
i knew he would be the best i could
find and he would be willing to do it
too but i had to tie him up some way
i had made up my mind that i would
double-cross landis if i had to but i
was going to protect myself
  i went to kings house one night and
told him my plan not all of it just
enough for him to see that it would
work if properly handled he wanted to
know everything but i wouldnt tell him
unless he consented to sign an agreement
to put the thing through
  that agreement was a risky thing be-
cause what we were going to do would
fear

put us both in jail if we were found
out he objected to putting his name
to anything but i convinced him of the
big possibilities and he said he would
sign
  you couldnt take a single chance
with king so i went to my office that
night to get the agreement ready i
knew how to uge the typewriter so i
wrote it out i made a carbon copy for
myself
  it was not eight oclock the next
morning when i reached my office i
was so anxious to get the deal started
and through with i hadnt slept any and
i wanted to be down where things were
going to happen i was surprised to
hear the typewriter clicking when i let
myself in and there was brentwood i
wondered what had brought him down
so early and he offered a pile of letters
as a reason so i felt satisfied
  by nine oclock king had signed the
agreement and when the market opened
we started to work you remember
when c  q broke about  points
king and i made a fortune but it broke
landis he lost his head when he saw
the market slipping because most of
his money had been tied up in c  q
he tried to hold it up but we had our
plans worked out too well we sold
short and i delivered landiss stock
until we could cover we did all right
  landis lost his nerve with his money
and shot himself i was sorry because
i had liked him and he had a wife and
a boy but he had no business in the
game anyway i was glad he hadnt
connected me with the break no one
else did either
  about six months after landis was
dead i took over the business as barnes
and company i saved a little money
out of the wreck for mrs landis and
she was comfortable she was a fine
woman and my little girl lucia played
and went to dancing school with her
boy
  everything started out fine for me
landiss conservative reputation helped
me out then on account of the time we
had been together and i had plenty
of money to back up anything i started
i load every chance in the world
  then this hound brentwood began
i had put him in charge of one of the
departments in the new firm and he
was making good he had been there
about three months when he came up to
my house one night he had been there
before at formal dinners once or twice
when my wife had thought it necessary
to entertain but there had never been
any friendship between us 
  this night he asked for me and came
into the library i was feeling pretty
good i had put over a fair-sized deal
that day and dinner had been comfort-
able we didnt have any guests
  i was surprised at the visit but i
didnt let on i offered him a drink and
a cigar he refused the cigar and
lighted one of his own cigarettes al-
ways had em made for him he told
me he didnt waste any remarks about
the weather or my health
  when are you thinking of increasing
the firm mr barnes he began
  that surprised me nothing i had
ever said to him had indicated any in-
tention of taking in any partners i
didnt need any all i needed was
money and room i had had two part-
ners and i didnt want any more landis
was dead and king too had died about
a month before apoplexy i believe
  at first i started to bawl him out
but i thought better of it maybe he
was trying to lead up to some idea with
a joke i had been with landis too
long and saw how much a man could
lose by not listening to ideas
  do you want to buy in i asked
him if he did have any scheme i was
ready to listen to it in the hope it was
worth while
  he seemed to be surprised he knew

fear
i had a temper he had been in my
office for a year i guess he was all set
for a fight right away but he smiled
and went on
  not buy exactly but i think it can
be arranged to suit us both
  like hell you do i yelled
  i was more than surprised i thought
he must have gone crazy but i didnt
like his smile he didnt say anything
just sat there and smiled at me
  he didnt look like a crazy man and
i began to wonder all the time he had
been with me he had been perfectly
sane and he had never tried to joke
he was efficient and always on the job
what had happened to make him start
out like he had was a mystery to me
  what do you mean  have you been 
drinking or dreaming i tried to keep
myself in hand because at the back of
my brain something had started to stir
men with brains dont usually have
crazy schemes and i knew he hadnt
been drinking and he wasnt the sort to
dream without something to base it on
  i began to think of reasons for him
getting up the nerve to say what he did
it took nerve and something else i
had never let him in on anything and
outsideof the deal with king there
hadnt been anything that could really
cause trouble and that king deal was
safe i had written the only papers in
the thing myself after the deal was
over king and i had taken care to burn
them
  but lie had to have some reason and
i was losing my temper again all the
while he just sat
  listen brentwood i told him then
i dont know what you are talking
about but the only satisfactory arrange-
ment you can reach with me is to be
ready to find another job by the first of
the month you are leaving us then
i am afraid you are wrong mr
barnes and he reached into his pocket
he brought out a leather case and
from it he took something and unfolded
it very carefully
  i couldnt make out what it was at
first it was black about the size of a
letter sheet then i saw it was a piece
of carbon paper
  even then i didnt get on right away
  did you ever see this before and
he held it up for me to see
  the marks of the typewriter stood
out i couldnt read them but i knew
what it was i remembered the morn-
ing of my deal with king and brent-
wood being down at the office early
when i wrote the agreement with king
i forgot all about the carbon paper i
really didnt realize until then that the
carbon would carry any record i must
have just dumped it into the waste-
basket when i finished
  brentwood was watching me and he
must have known what i was thinking
  what is it anyway and i tried to
keep my voice what it had been before
but i was beginning to get nervous i
had been learning things about brent-
wood ever since he began the conver-
sation
  do you want me to read it to you
mr barnes
  as he asked the question he smiled
again i had stood all of that smile i
was going to it must have made me
lose my head i couldnt take a chance
on that thing coming out with landis
not yet dead a year i had to have that
piece of carbon
  he sidestepped me as i rushed and
grabbed me from behind i told you
he had played football
  there is no need for excitement
barnes he dropped the mr then
you cant get this away from me with-
out killing me you had better listen
to reason
  i saw i couldnt manhandle him i
never have been a strong man and his
grip on my wrists was like iron
  well say what youve got to say
fear
i managed to control my temper long
enaugh to get it out
  suppose we outline a few possibili-
ties first he began there isnt a
chance of convicting you of anything by
this piece of carbon paper by itself
the district attorney couldnt use it as
evidence without something to back it
up but what happened to c  q
about nine months ago everyone knows
this little piece of paper tells what was
going to happen before it ever did it
also mentions the matter of landiss
stock old king may be dead but he
still has a grip on you
  i dont want to take this to the dis-
trict attorney i wouldnt have to as
far as that goes public opinion would
be enough if i made this public it
would be an unpleasant scandal and it
might be hard for me to get located
profitably after having been so inti-
mately connected with you besides
there isnt anything one-tenth so good
as what you can give me for a twenty
per cent interest in the firm i will tuck
this little piece of paper away in a safe
deposit vault and the world will move
merrily on
  he had turned me loose and we were
sitting facing each other i believe then
was the first time i had ever had a good
look at his eyes they were close to-
gether and there was a kind of murky
green fire playing around way down
deep his whole face was different
  there wasnt anything to it i
argued with him about how the district
attorney would laugh at his romantic
idea of using a piece of carbon paper
but he had me scared and he knew it
then i agreed to his plan with an
amendment that he burn the paper
  he laughed then and it was a long
way from a chuckle he must be laugh-
ing like that now knowing what is going
to happen to me
  burn it and let you get me like you
did landis he wanted to know i
n

know you barnes and there is nothing
you wouldnt do to make money my
proposition is made and it goes you
can take it or leave it
  i took another look at that face and
i agreed he smiled then and drew out
a little pile of papers from his pocket
one was articles of agreement for the
partnership providing for the change
of the firm name the others were
notices for the papers of the change i
signed them all and then i wondered
how he had happened to look for the
carbon i hated to ask him but i had
to know
  you have a bad habit of leaving
tilings around he told me when i did
ask besides that i have been with
you long enough to see your crooked
brain work i saw you make a play at
old king one day at lunch you re-
member the day you had crackers and
milk i knew you usually had roast
beef and all the vegetables you could
find on the menu finishing up with pie
  i saw you meet him other times and
i knew that you were discussing trouble
for someone you may not remember
but i helped you check over the securi-
ties in the landis safe deposit box one
day then i began to watch you i
knew something was coming and that
you would make a fortune i wasnt
going to be left out
  the night before you went up to
kings house you did a little figuring on
your scheme you burned some of the
papers i found the ashes but you must
have crumpled up one of them without
thinking about it i dont mind telling
you i found it in your wastebasket
i had discovered a search of that basket
every night was usually worth while
  i heard you call mrs barnes and
tell her you were not coming home for
dinner and i followed you until i saw
you safely in kings house when i
came down next morning i met the
night watchman leaving and he re-
marked that you must be trying to check
me up because you had been down to
the office the night before using the
typewriter you see i had a pretty clear
trail
  the cigar i smoked that night was
the last comfortable one i have had un-
til this there hasnt been a moment
until last night that i havent thought
about that piece of carbon paper and
dont think brentwood let me forget
about it either
  he didnt mention it for a year then
he came in and remarked that he thought
he was growing more valuable as a
member of the firm i wasnt quite
cowed then and i let myself go for a
minute but he brought me up sharp
oh he had me all right i agreed
  the next time came about two years
later he asked me up to his apartment
to dinner that night i went and he
asked for another five per cent there
wasnt any argument at all
  dont think that brentwood wasnt
making good i-ie had a genius for
finance he never had a scheme that
failed of course we didnt make mil-
lions out of everything he brought up
but we never lost and he worked hard
  my dinner engagements with him
came about every two years which
brought us up to six months ago i
never had anything to do with him out-
side of the office except at dinners at my
house formal dinners when he was
just one of the guests
  each time i went to his place he had a
five per cent larger interest in the firm
the last time left him with a full half
  i had begun to take it for granted
i knew that every two years i would
have to eat all alone with him and listen
to his rotten talk about women he was
a cad and he knew i hated his stories
thats the reason he told them
  then after dinner he would make his
same smiling demand and there was
nothing for me to do
  did i tell you that i hadnt had a
peaceful moment since he showed me
that paper i couldnt tell my wife
about it she is a wonderful woman
she doesnt even suspect that i was
mixed up in the landis affair
  you are the first human being i have
been able to tell this thing to after fif-
teen years of living it fifteen years is
a long time i dont want your sym-
pathy its all over now and i want
to get it off my mind
  but that doesnt make any difference
about my shooting brentwood as i
said he called on me last about six
months ago i thought then that i
would have two more years of almost
peace when something else came up
  you may have seen a picture of my
daughter lucia it was published last
winter when she made her debut she
is her mother all over again and i am
just daddy to her
  she has always been my pal since she
was a little girl and she is now too
  anyway she made her debut last
winter and brentwood started coming
to the house more frequently i would
come home in the afternoon and find
him at tea my wife asked him to din-
ner two or three times just with the
family she had never seen him ask
for a larger share of the firm
  it kept up so that i began to have a
big fear bigger than my fear of brent-
wood and his carbon paper suppose
my girl should fall in love with him
  a couple of nights ago by some
chance she was staying- at home she
came into the library where i was try-
ing to read and i decided to try to find
out how much she liked brentwood
  she came over and sat on the arm
of my chair and pulled my hair
  rwhere is brentwood tonight i
started to question her
  pining away in some dark den prob-
ably i refused to let him come up i
told him it was daddys night
  i patted her hand but still that didnt
mean anything
  it seems to me he is coming around
pretty frequently these days
  you are not the only one who thinks
so and she blushed
  fathers may be stupid but i knew
my daughter and there was a great load
gone oft my mind
  who is he i tried to be very stern
  then she slipped down into my lap
and told me it was young landis the
boy had more push than his father and
was a comer i liked him they had
decided that he was to come to see me
the next day and she had stayed at
home to tell me about it her mother
had already given her approval
  young landis came to see me yes-
terday i liked the way he talked and
i told him i was glad that lucia had
chosen him when he left i felt so
good i told brentwood about it i had
to tell someone because it meant so
much to have my girl happy he said
that landis was to be congratulated and
left it at that
  his manner meant nothing to me and
i had about decided to give myself a
half holiday when he came into my of-
fice and invited me to dinner that night
he saw i was happy and he wasnt
going to let me be he knew i wouldnt
refuse to go
  i went everybody knows that now
he was just the same at dinner as ever
the same boasting of his amours i
managed to live through it because all
the time my mind was busy wondering
whether i could argue him out of ask-
ing for a larger share of the firm right
at present i wanted to give lucia and
landis a start and i had to get all the
returns i could get to do it properly
  but it wasnt money he was after
  i am not going to keep you in
suspense barnes brentwood began
the reason i invited you up here im-
mediately was to prevent you making
the mistake you did this morning it
will never do for you to announce
lucias engagement to too many people
they might not understand it later
understand what i demanded i
didnt need an answer i knew what he
meant but i had to have him say it
  because barnes you will have to
arrange for her to marry me
  i didnt argue
  i shot him
ill
  barnes finished his story as the train
was crashing over the switches of the
grand central when they reached the
station the banker reached out his
wrists for the handcuffs but thorne ap-
parently didnt see the movement as he
led the way out
  after thorne had deposited his
prisoner at the tombs his one thought
was the piece of carbon paper in brent-
woods safe deposit box a brief sketch
of bames story procured an order for
his entry to the box
  buried under a mass of bonds securi-
ties and letters thorne found an un-
marked envelope in it was a piece of
carbon paper carefully folded once
  the detective had brought a mirror
with him and he held it before the car-
bon to read the damning evidence
with staring eyes he read

madame blavsky t h e
worlds greatest tragedienne
was dead
          they found her in the cold
gray of the morning lying upon the floor
of her drawing-room her beautiful face
twisted into a look of horror her great
brown eyes wide open glazed protrud-
ing her red lips purpled blackened
swollen-set in a sickening grin
  her dress had been torn away from
the rounded shoulders-the shoulders
that had been toasted and raved over by
a thousand critics between the breasts
was a red gash where the angry knife
had entered there were dark marks
of fingers on the skin of the milky neck
  the long slender hands were torn and
bruised twisted out of shape the flesh
scratched as the rings had been brutally
pulled from the fingers by the assassin
in his eagerness to escape
  an open downstairs window showed
how entrance had been gained yet
there were no marks of feet in the
ground beneath it had rained during
the day and the earth would have re-
tained the footprints had any been made
  the drawing-room showed no signs
of a struggle not a piece of furniture
was disturbed not a rug out of place
but several drawers pulled out their
contents scattered carelessly about the
floor showed that a hurried search had
been made for valuables
  but aside from the rings torn from
the madames fingers and possibly sev-
eral less valuable trinkets nothing of
value had been taken except-
the life-size painting of madame in
the role of lady macbeth-the painting
by rumley which had created such a
furore at the paris exhibition five years
before-had disappeared frame and all
from its accustomed place on the wall
  the servants were questioned none
could throw any light on the affair-
none save felice the maid during the
night she had heard the voice of her mis-
tress raised in an agonized shriek of
horror the sound of a fall then her
mistress had exclaimed in tones so
tense so vibrant that they caused the
chills to creep up and down her back
and every nerve to tingle with fear
 oh mother of god help me
help me can no one hear me may
my spirit never rest until it has driven
you to confess
  the voice had stopped suddenly with
a choking sort of gurgle she felice
had pulled the covers over her head to
drown it out why had she not sum-
moned help she shrugged her pretty
shoulders did the officers not know
that madame suffered from insomnia as
a result of the nervous attack which had
driven her from the stage on such
occasions she was wyit to assume the
roles she had played in years gone by
and-there was another shrug of the
shoulders which spoke plainer than
words-madame was like all great art-
ists temperamental when buried in
one of her characters she sometimes
reached a high pitch of excitement for
safetys sake it was not always best to
interrupt
  the other servants although they had
not heard madames cry as described by
felice corroborated the maids story of
the nocturnal roles they had learned


the woman who cursed a man
by experience to keep their distance in
the servants quarters it was hinted
that at such times madames unstrung
nerves drove her almost mad
  add to this that on the night of the
murder there had been no moon and
that the street lights in the vicinity had
been put out of commission as a result
of the storm of the day previous and
you have the story in a nutshell
ii
  the career of madame blavsky had
been a spectacular one whence she
came no one knew reams of specula-
tion had been written-speculation pure
and simple-for madame was decidedly
reticent in regard to her past all the
press and public knew was that she had
suddenly appeared in the offices of rich-
ard raine broadways most successful
producer-a rarely beautiful woman of
almost middle age with the face and
figure of a queen-and demanded a try-
out in the shakespearian revival he was
planning something about her caused
the busy man to accede to her demands
two hours later he the best judge of
things theatrical in america had pro-
claimed her the most wonderful trage-
dienne of modern times and had signed
a contract with her at her own terms a
month later her fame had spread to the
ends of the earth
  then came ten years of stardom a
nervous breakdown was followed by
permanent retirement for two years
she had lived a sequestered life refusing
to see even the friends of her former
life denying herself to all
  possessing more than the usual artis-
tic temperament the house which she
had purchased in which to spend her
declining years was one which reflected
the strange odd character of its mis-
tress erected prior to the revolution
it was set in the midst of spacious
grounds surrounded by an ancient iron
picket fence and almost hidden by trees
it had once been pretentious but decay
had claimed it for many years two
stories in height its deep narrow win-
dows heavily shuttered over its sides
a tenacious ivy plant climbing almost to
the tottering tower it seemed to be
slowly mouldering into nothingness
  yet withal it possessed an air of mys-
tery and silence which appealed to the
world-weary heart of madame blavsky
and she had bought it on sight the ex-
terior remained unchanged the in-
terior save for the installation of mod-
ern furniture and conveniences was as
it had always been-dark and gloomy-
charged with mystery and the flavor of
hidden panels of romance and tragedy
ill
  the day after the funeral of madame
blavsky richard raine went into vol-
untary bankruptcy on the day follow-
ing amos spaulding the well-known
attorney notified the officials that the
last will and testament of the murdered
woman was in his possession impor-
tant litigation in another state had taken
him from the city he had been too
busy to read the papers upon his re-
turn he had learned of his clients tragic
death and was ready to assist in bring-
ing the assassin to justice in any way
possible
  in the presence of a dozen police offi-
cials and reporters the will was opened
and read drawn up a scant three
months before and witnessed by three
attaches of spauldings office it was a
brief document its preamble stated
that the madame was possessed of no
kin of any kind the servants were re-
membered with small bequests amount-
ing to perhaps ten thousand dollars
  the remainder of the estate which
the testatrix estimated at nearly half a
million dollars in money and jewels
was left to richard raine her former
manager

the woman who cursed a man

  the signature was genuine of that
there was no doubt and the reputation
of amos spaulding was above reproach 
he was not the sort of man to be in-
volved in any crooked deal
  raine was the most surprised man of
all he stated emphatically that he
had not seen madame blavsky for six
months had he known that he was to
be the recipient of her bounty he cer-
tainly would not have taken advantage
of the bankruptcy laws but would have
staved off his creditors until he was able
to settle with them and re-establish him-
self upon a firm business foundation
  because of the bequest the police
grilled raine which under the circum-
stances practically amounted to accus-
ing him of the murder he countered
with a cast-iron alibi on the night of
the murder he had not left his apart-
ments but had remained at home going
over his accounts and preparing for the
bankruptcy courts
  his statement was corroborated by
hoskins his valet hoskins however
complicated matters by stating that he
had admitted a heavily veiled woman
shortly after nine oclock in the evening
and that she had not yet gone when
raine dismissed him at eleven at-
raines orders he had placed a cold
lunch on the sideboard and had then
retired to his own quarters in the rear
of the ten-room suite he did not know
what time the veiled woman had left
  the servants at the home of madame
blavsky stated that they had retired to
their own quarters shortly after dinner
the only exception was felice whose
night off it had been she had returned
from visiting a friend between ten and
eleven coming in by the servants en-
trance it was always madames orders
that on such occasions she should go to
her own room the madame preferring
to prepare herself for bed rather than
run the risk of being disturbed should
she fall asleep
  since none of madame blavskys
household had seen her from the time
dinner was served until her body was
found next morning the police worked
on the assumption that it had been she
who visited raine on the night in ques-
tion just what they expected to gain
by the assertion they did not state the
press however made a great deal of
the incident to complicate matters
raine refused to divulge the name of his
fair visitor asserting angrily that to do
so would compromise the name of a
good woman who had visited him purely
upon a matter of business which was no
affair of the police or public
 whereupon fannie fox who had
been a comedienne in one of raines de-
funct companies came forward and
tearfully admitted to being the woman
in question she wras willing to run the
risk of ruining her reputation she
stated rather than see raine suffer for a
crime of which he was innocent she
had gone to raines apartments dis-
guised at his request she stated because
he was back in his salaries with all his
players she had known the manager
for years and he-wished to settle with
her without the others knowing it they
had been hounding him to a degree
where he was afraid to go to his offices
consequently when he had telephoned
to her earlier in the evening asking her
to visit him and talk matters over she
had veiled herself as he asked
  raines alibi was complete
  a week later he took the police into
his confidence and asked for their help
where was the money madame blavsky
had willed to him in her signed
statement she had admitted to being
worth nearly half a million dollars the
books of the first national trust and
savings bank showed that they had had
nearly that amount invested to her credit
up until a week before her death at
that time she had suddenly asked that
her securities be converted into cash and


the woman who cursed a man
crook though he managed to hold her
love and got her to make her will in his
favor
  finding himself going to the wall
he asked her to help him and she drew
her money from the bank for that pur-
pose
  meanwhile he had been secretly
married to the fox woman and the af-
fair in some way reached blavskys ears
of an extremely jealous and emotional
temperament she disguised herself with
a heavy veil and went to his apartments
to denounce him
  when she told him that she was
through because he had thrown her
overboard for a younger woman raine
at first begged then hard pressed for
money and realizing that she was his last
resort he lost control of himself and
tried force he says that he had no
intention of killing her when he came
to his right senses he had choked her
into insensibility and really thought that
she was dead
  the emergency caused him to think
rapidly his apartments are on the sec-
ond floor and there is a garage in con-
nection running down the back stairs
he got out his car brought it to the back
door and covering blavskys body with
a blanket carried it down and drove like
the devil for her home
  the absence of lights aided him as
did the darkness of blavskys grounds
arriving he carried the body into the
house letting himself in by means of her
key realizing that he could be no
worse off whatever happened he com-
menced ransacking the place for money
  about this time she recovered con-
sciousness he imagined that she was
about to yell for help-probably she was
-and he seized her again
  he choked her she grabbed a paper
cutter from the table and tried to fight
back but in her weakened state she
was no match for him and he killed her
with her own weapon it was when she
was dying that she shrieked out that
curse that the maid heard he hastily
threw open the window jerked the
rings from her fingers and escaped
through the door to his machine and got
back to his own place unobserved that
is why there were no marks on the
ground beneath the window
  when he found himself up against it
he admitted his guilt to the fox woman
she lied in order to provide him with
an alibi
  i had a hunch that i might get him
to make some misstep if i took him out
there tonight there was a storm brew-
ing and it was an ideal night for ghost
stories thats why i phoned for gas-
sidy to hustle out there and remove all
the bulbs from the sockets before we ar-
rived ill admit though that i pretty
nearly talked myself out of ghost stories
waiting for that extra flashlight battery
to burn itself out i underestimated it
by half an hour most men have a
streak of superstition in them even if i
havent but then i never committed
a murder
  i guess that i was pretty nearly as
badly frightened as he was though
when i saw the madame coming at him
as the lightning flashed you see she
had that picture of herself as lady
macbeth on a secret panel that had been
built in the old house why she had it
turned to the wall at the time she was
killed i dont know but at any rate
raine in stumbling pressed liis hand ac-
cidentally against the button the panel
turned just as the lightning flashed and
it looked as if she was rushing straight
at him her hands reaching out for him
  sure she had the money hidden in
the secret closet behind the panel i
brought it back with me
  no im not superstitious chief
but remember that curse she put on
him well the way things happened
just as they did-maybe sir oliver
lodge may be right after all
thornton smiled significantly
by david morrison
i
       here is a-lady outside who
   wishes to see you there is a
    man with her
          whats the name thorn-
ton asked visibly annoyed at the un-
timely intrusion
  she would give no name she said
you would not know her she seems
very anxious to see you
  thornton reflected a few moments
it was rather early for callers and he
had been about to dictate his morning
mail he resented the visit but for
some reason he could not fathom he
felt a slight curiosity as to the identity
of his callers he turned suddenly to
his secretary
  show them in miss armstrong
please
  as the pair entered thorntons curi-
osity was increased
  the woman was about thirty years
of age and strikingly attractive she
was expensively gowned and bore all
the earmarks of wealth but her com-
panion was rather shabbily dressed and
impressed one as a servant of the wo-
man the woman entered first the
man following behind her slowly al-
most timidly thornton noticed that
he clutched in his hand a large square
box-like affair covered with black
cloth
  mr thornton the woman gushed
advancing with a friendliness that was
almost brazen
  thornton arose wonderingly im
afraid you have the advantage of
me
  i am miss bender-miss ruth
bender the caller beamed im sorry
if ive chosen a busy moment to in-
trude but im sure you will pardon me
when the nature of my visit is made
known
  thornton motioned his visitor to a
seat and as she drew up a chair looked
lip questioningly at her companion
she seemed to have forgotten the man
and she now turned toward him in sud-
den remembrance
  just take a chair mr parker she
said making no move to introduce her
companion who was standing some few
feet away gazing stupidly about the
room and shifting from one foot to the
other he made no effort to put down
the cloth-covered object he was holding
  at the sound of the womans voice
the man turned dully found a chair and
sat down making no move to draw the
chair closer evidently not considering
himself a party to the conference he
held the black box on his lap and
seemed to handle it with extraordinary
care
  the woman turned to thornton
  i suppose youre wondering at the
reason for my call she began
  thornton smiled non-committally
  its something of the greatest impor-
tance the stranger continued so i
chose a time when i thought we would
be least likely to be interrupted its
of a very confidential nature we will
not be disturbed 
  thornton found himself wondering
just what it was about the woman that
he did not like but she had now aroused
his curiosity and he determined to give


thornton smiled significantly
her an audience he rang for his sec-
retary
  will you see that i am not disturbed
for the next ten minutes he said to
miss armstrong when she entered
  the girl nodded assent and with-
drew
  when the door had closed the
woman turned to thornton rather
mysteriously
  mr thornton as a live-wire busi-
ness man i believe youre interested in
any legitimate proposition promising
unusually large financial rewards she
began
  thornton breathed a sigh of relief
tinged with disappointment the wo-
mans manner and method of approach
had whetted his curiosity and expecta-
tions but he now prepared to listen to
the usual harangue of the expert stock
salesman
  ill warn you beforehand he inter-
rupted im not interested in stocks of
any nature
  the woman smiled knowingly i
havent come to sell you any stock mr
thornton the proposition i have in
mind is something bigger better surer
the rewards are-well tremendous
  she leaned forward suddenly with
an air of utmost confidence her voice
was almost a whisper and she glanced
occasionally at  man who had ac-
companied her and who was busy fixing
the mysterious box in a comfortable
position on his lap
  mr thornton the woman said in
a low voice that man there has a de-
vice that is destined to earn tremen-
dous rewards for its owners
  thornton glanced at the box on the
mans lap with renewed interest
  what is it he asked
  that i cannot divulge at this time
if you are interested ill have him ex-
plain in detail it is his own invention
and naturally he is very jealous of his
secret he will let no oue into the
secret unless there is a probability of
their being interested
  like all inventors she went on he
is in need of financial assistance if he
should show his device to you now you
would grasp the secret immediately
our proposition is this it will require a
considerable amount of capital to float
this thing properly but when you once
learn the secret you will readily agree
that it is the surest investment a man
could possibly make the question is
not whether it is a sure or risky
investment-there is no doubt of its
feasibility-but a question solely of
finances it will take considerable
money and we do not wish to take up
your time or our own unless you are
readily able to handle a proposition of
this size
  that would of course depend en-
tirely upon my own opinion of its
merit thornton replied mystified and
curious to learn the nature of the
device
  certainly mr thornton the wo-
man returned we could hardly ex-
pect anyone to interest themselves in
something they have no confidence in
but it is not a question of confidence-
the moment you learn the secret youll
agree with us that the potential rewards
in it are tremendous now granting
that you are interested would you be
able to finance a proposition requiring
a considerable sum of money could
you lay your hands on-say-fifty
thousand dollars cash at any moment 
  double that amount if the proposi-
tion is worth it thornton replied
now really anxious to learn more about
the mysterious box on the strangers
lap
  good  the woman answered enthu-
siastically she turned to the man who
had accompanied her mr parker
will you demonstrate your device to
mr thornton
  the man arose and stood by his chair
thornton smiled significantly

as he fumbled with several little con-
trivances on the mysterious box he
made no effort to advance closer to
thorntons desk
  the woman leaned closer to thorn-
ton confidentially and whispered to him
hes suspicious of everyone he wont
show you the complete details now but
youll learn enough when you see it in
operation it will surprise you i assure
you i
  the man was facing directly toward
thornton as he fumbled in his pockets
for an object which he laid on the top
of the box a false lid was raised and
thornton could not see what the ob-
ject was that the man placed on the
box for the upraised lid hid it from
view
  the man seemed to have trouble in
working some of the mysterious parts
for he finally laid the box on the chair
by his side to give him entire freedom
of both hands he bent down over the
box for a few seconds while he worked
with something behind the upraised lid
  suddenly the woman at thorntons
side uttered a half-smothered shriek and
clasped her hand to her heart thorn-
ton turned quickly in alarm the wo-
mans eyes were widely dilated for a
moment as if in extreme agony then
she suddenly slumped over in a faint
she would have fallen but thornton
quickly reached out his arm and caught
her he supported her in his arms
while he looked up at the man
  get me some water quick this
woman has fainted
  the man seemed to grasp the situa-
tion instantly for he immediately
turned and hurried toward the door
leading into the outer office as he did
so there was a sudden blinding flash
of light from the mysterious box on the
chair
  events in the next few moments
happened with dramatic rapidity the
man turned suddenly at the flash of
light grabbed the mysterious box and
hurried out of the office the uncon-
scious woman in thorntons arms sud-
denly revived fixed her slightly
disarrayed hat and gown and arose to
take her departure
  she smiled amusedly at the thor-
oughly mystified and dumbstruck
thornton
  i thank you so much for the audi-
ence mr thornton she smiled but i
do not want to take up any more of
your time than is absolutely necessary
well return at this time tomorrow-
with the photograph
  photograph  thornton repeated
the light of comprehension entering his
eyes
  yes provided of course that it
proves to be a good one if it should
not turn out clearly enough we wont
bother you again
  then that-mysterious invention
was a-
  camera the woman smiled mock-
ingly it seldom fails weve taken
some wonderfully good photographs
with it
  convinced now that the womans mo-
tives were ulterior thornton con-
fronted her with a feeling of resentment
at having been tricked so easily
  im a busy man miss-bender
give me your proposition in as few
words as possible he said curtly
  she seemed gallingly oblivious to his
scorn we expect to have a very good
photograph of you mr thornton-
with me in your arms its merely a
question of who considers that pho-
tograph of greater value-you or-mrs
thornton we consider it worth to you
at least five thousand dollars that
shouldnt be a staggering sum te a man
who can lay his hands on fifty thou-
sand cash at any moment he desires
and suppose i-dont censider it
worth-or rather suppose i refuse to
pay the blackmail 

thornton smiled significantly
  then of course i shall make the
best bargain possible with mrs thorn-
ton im giving you first option
  so generous of you thornton
smiled scornfully
  she seemed entirely unabashed and
stood waiting expectantly as if never
doubting the final acceptance of her
offer
  thornton was interested in the wo-
mans methods she seemed so confident
of herself
  tell me he said interestedly is
this an-everyday occurrence with
you
  she smiled reprovingly
  rich men are not so plentiful mr
thornton besides we must pick our
time i never take chances-i always
make sure of my ground first you
will notice i chose a time when you
would be least likely to have any
callers
  but why all the rigmarole about
the mysterious invention  he per-
sisted
  i cant seem to conquer my love for
dramatics mr thornton the woman
replied smiling sheepishly i once
followed the profession you know until
i	discovered there were greater returns
in my present one besides it is rather
difficult to prepare to take a flashlight
in a mans office without exciting his
suspicion the curtain covering the
lens of the camera you will recall was
not drawn back until the exact moment
before the charge of powder was ig-
nited all a matter of mechanism she
explained rather proudly
  i suppose the-returns-are veiy
gratifying he queried noticing a huge
diamond on her finger
  t have no complaint she replied
not taken back in the slightest some-
times it is-rather embarrassing-but i
try to cause as little trouble as pos-
sible
  and is that part of your returns
thornton asked pointing to the stone
on her hand which was flashing bril-
liantly in the early morning sunlight
  she gazed proudly at the diamond
  isnt it gorgeous she said enthu-
siastically
  thornton knew enough of precious
stones to realize that the ring must have
cost several thousand dollars the dia-
mond was extraordinarily large and of
very fine cut
  the woman turned suddenly to go
  well mr thornton i know youre
a busy man so i wont take up any
more of your time-today if we have
been unfortunate in our photography
we will not bother rou again if it
comes up to our expectations i shall
return tomorrow at this time for your
decision
  thornton bowed her out admiring
in spite of himself the womans self-
possession and complete confidence
  a few moments later he rang for his
secretary anxious to get his days mail
off his mind so that he could give
thought to the new problem that had
thrust itself upon him he waited a
few moments and was surprised that
miss armstrong wasnot as prompt as
usual in answering
  he looked into the outer office and
found her at her desk gazing dreamily
out the window apparently oblivious to
her surroundings
  he called her wonderingly she rose
with a start and smiling sheepishly
followed him into his office
  day dreaming lif asked smiling
  miss armstrong laughed rather
shamefacedly yes and a very fool-
ish thing to dream about i was pictur-
ing myself wearing the ring worn by
the lady who just left
  it was a beauty wasnt it  he con-
ceded
  oh it was wonderful his secre-
tary exclaimed with beaming eyes
  from the expression on the girls
thornton smiled significantly

face thornton could understand how
some women sold their souls for less
expensive baubles
ii
  promptly at ten-thirty the next
morning miss bender called and was
ushered immediately into thorntons
private office
  thornton nodded a pleasant greeting
and offered her a chair he noticed a
large envelope in her hand and surmised
that it contained the photograph lie
glanced up at her expectantly
  i have good news mr thornton
miss bender smiled that is good news
if you look at it from my viewpoint
you succeeded in getting a good
photograph 
excellent it could not be clearer
he found himself wondering why he
was able to joke so pleasantly with this
woman who had so easily tricked him
and then laughed at his stupidity
  now would you mind giving me
your proposition in detail miss-
there is nothing that i did not tell
you yesterday mr thornton she in-
terrupted i have the photograph here
which my assistant took yesterday it
is a first class likeness of yourself hold-
ing me in your arms i believe it
should be worth at least five thousand
dollars to you if you dont agree with
me then i shall strike a bargain with
mrs thornton for it-and im sure it
would interest her
  and if i pay you this five thousand
dollars what is to prevent you from-
ill give you the negative also and
my word of honor that i shall make no
further attempt to use the incident
against you
  thornton smiled at the reference to
her word of honor
  you realize i suppose he said
slowly and with emphasis that this is
pure blackmail
  please dont use that word mr
thornton  the woman returned mock-
ingly there are so many nicer ways
of expressing it
  would you mind allowing me to see
what i am asked to pay such a sum of
money for thornton said changing
the subject abruptly
  his visitor obligingly produced the
photograph and handed it over from
the attitude of the two in the picture
it certainly would be conclusive evi-
dence in any divorce court thornton
gazed at it a few moments smiling
enigmatically then turned to his desk
and picked up a large envelope plac-
ing the photograph inside he silently
addressed the envelope and sealed it
  his visitor scented trickery just a
reminder mr thornton that you
havent paid for the photograph yet
and another reminder that i still have
the negative and can make as many
duplicates as i choose
  thornton made no reply but turned
and faced the door leading into his
outer office
  have you everything so far miss
armstrong he asked without raising
his voice
  the woman turned quickly on her
guard but she saw no one the man
at the desk was evidently talking to the
wall she glanced hurriedly about the
office then turned and stared wonder-
ingly at thornton
  three short sharp knocks sounded
on the outer door
  thornton smiled
  you may cut the wires now miss
armstrong please he said pleasantly
  two short knocks sounded on the
door in answer to his instructions
  thornton turned to his caller now
miss-bender is it-i want to thank
you for the photograph and compli-
ment you on the excellence of the
work
the womans lips curled in contempt
s
thornton smiled significantly
and she laughed carelessly evidently
confident of herself
  i must warn you again mr thorn-
ton that i still have the negative its
a matter of a few minutes to make a
duplicate of that photograph
  thornton ignored her remark as he
continued i will admit that i con-
sider the photograph easily worth the
amount you ask but as long as it is not
necessary to purchase it why should i 
  the woman arose furious and pre-
pared to make her departure
  just a moment please thornton
said quietly ill have to ask my secre-
tary to unlock the door before you
can go
  the woman rushed angrily to the
door for she believed thornton was
bluffing she tried the knob and found
the door locked
  she turned to the man at the desk
with challenging eyes
  well whats the game she panted
her first doubts beginning to assail her
sense of security
  wont you sit down a few mo-
ments thornton said smiling at her
discomfiture
  miss bender obeyed then turned as
if waiting for his next move
  i think you told me your-profes-
sion was a very well paid one he
began
  his visitor glared at him venomously
and made no reply
  assuming that your words are true
i should think your liberty would be
worth something to you
  miss bender turned her face ugly in
its mask of baffled rage
  you can turn me over to the police
but a copy of that photograph will be
in mrs thorntons hands tomorrow
she cried furiously my assistant will
attend to that and what i will swear
to on the witness stand will be plenty
  thornton smiled at her anger some-
how he felt a curious sense of pleasure
  in playing with her as a cat does be-
fore eating the mouse it has caught
  my secretary has taken down every
word that has passed between us this
morning he resumed
  he arose and pulled aside a large
picture hanging on the wall
  the woman turned and saw a dic-
taphone and knew the man was not
bluffing
  you realize i suppose that it is
within my power to-
  well whats your proposition the
blackmailer demanded impatiently
  thornton reached over and pointed
to the ring  her finger if you con-
sider a half-hours work worth five
thousand dollars wouldnt you consider
your liberty worth-that ring
  the woman seemed dumbstruck at
his words
  why its preposterous she ex-
claimed seething with fury
  thats according to the viewpoint
you adopt thornton replied quietly
with a note of triumphant mockery in
his voice im busy miss bender but
ill grant you ten minutes to make your
decision hand over that ring on your
finger and ill give you your freedom
and make no attempt at prosecution for
your attempted blackmail otherwise
i shall be compelled to telephone for the
police
  after a few minutes deliberation the
woman suddenly tore the ring from her
finger and threw it angrily  his desk
an almost imperceptible sob escaped
her lips
  thornton picked up the ring and
placed it in his pocket before you go
miss bender i want to add to your dis-
appointment by telling you that mrs
thornton would gladly have given you
five thousand dollars for that photo-
graph  that dictaphone you saw be-
hind the picture was placed there by
detectives in the employ of mrs thorn-
ton she suspected that i was in love
thornton smiled significantly

with my secretary i pretepded igno-
rance and allowed the instrument to
remain though i knew of its presence
from the beginning it was an easy
matter to run in another wire for my
stenographer yesterday in readiness for
your return
  he pressed the button on his desk and
miss armstrong unlocked the door and
entered
  he handed her the envelope contain-
ing the photograph
  will you please mail that for me at
once miss armstrong and register
it please
  the girl took the package and left
the office
  the woman took advantage of her
opportunity and gained the safety of
the outer office she turned and glared
evilly at thornton
	well mr thornton for your trick-
ery ill reward you by telling you that
mrs thornton will receive a copy of
that photograph in tomorrow mornings
mail
  which wont particularly interest
her thornton replied smilingly as
she will receive the original in this af-
ternoons mail my secretary has just
mailed it to her by registered mail
you mailed that to-your wife
the woman gasped incredulously
  certainly you see miss bender
a divorce is the best thing that could
possibly be handed to both mrs thorn-
ton and myself our marriage is one
that was never destined to last it has
survived this long only because of lack
of sufficient grounds for divorce and
i would not think of bringing any un-
pleasant notoriety to any lady-until
you obligingly handed me what both
mrs thornton and myself have been
seeking for months good day and
think you so much
  the woman stormed out of the office
furious at the circumstances that had
robbed her of the large sum she
had expected and nettled at the taunt-
ing mockery in her intended victims
voice
  a few minutes later miss armstrong
returned she handed her employer
the postal receipt for the registered
package
  got it off all right he smiled
  yes it will probably be delivered
this afternoon
  good he smiled rather anx-
iously he turned suddenly to the girl
vallance what was it you were day
dreaming over yesterday when you
didnt hear my ring for dictation
  the girl gazed at him in smiling un-
certainty for a moment the incident not
coming to her instantly
  oh about the ring that woman was
wearing she replied laughing sheep-
ishly
  well it was one day dream that
came true thornton said reaching in
his vest pocket
  he withdrew his hand and placed the
ring on her finger the girls eyes
widened in astonishment as she stared
at the sparkling stone in disbelief
  why its just like the one that-
woman wore she breathed in rapt
admiration the stone is fully as
large
  yes it does resemble it somewhat
doesnt it thornton smiled signifi-
cantly

  it was this vein he said pointing to his arm with the point
  of the needle-page 
the dark brown dress
               by meredith beyers
i
this story begins with the tale
one henry grover told meroe
before seven in the morning
after i had ushered him into the
room we had never seen him before
  he was bald with the exception of a
curious and rather ugly strip of black
hair at the back of his head his eye-
brows were heavy and black and above
the left one there was a mole with a long
hair growing out of it which seemed to
bother the eye beneath he tilted back
his head to gaze at us from under half-
lowered lids which seemed too heavy to
raise themselves his face was smooth
and molded with odd lines about the
mouth
  i have a room on the sixth floor of
the buckmuwter facing south he said
my desk makes an angle with the win-
dow and i sit so the light comes from
the left and a little behind by slightly
turningmy head i can see the face of
the claridge across the rather narrow
street
  now you must have observed mr
meroe that it is unpleasant to be stared
at that there is something distressingly
tangible about it even when you are not
aware of the owner or the location of
the eyes which are staring at you this
feeling came to me yesterday afternoon
i looked hastily about the room my
door was closed and i was alone i
looked out of the window opposite
stretched the windows of the sixth floor
of the claridge every ten yards was a
set of bay windows not directly oppo-
site but just three or four windows to
the right was the third of these sets
   there i glanced instinctively and
rather furtively trying to conceal the
fact in the side window was the back
of a settee beyond this i saw a rather
stout and elderly woman with slightly
gray hair and a dark brown dress sitting
motionless in a locking chair and star-
ing at me
   this annoyed me so that i resolved
to outstare her i turned my chair
slightly and directed a defiant glare
which i held for perhaps thirty seconds
before i discovered that she had not
been looking at me at all she took ab-
solutely no notice of my action
  laughing at myseff i attempted
once more to resume my writing but
again felt the irresistible impulse to turn
my eyes    still the steady stare
then for the first time i noticed some-
thing just above the back of the left end
of the settee it was the head of a man
the confused reflections at that part of
the window had prevented me from dis-
tinguishing him before of course i
thought to myself the man was un-
doubtedly talking to her and she was
iistening very attentively but my train
of thoughts had been wrecked and work
was useless so i put on my hat and went
 out fcfr a walk
   it was nearly supper time so i went
downtown to my favorite restaurant
on the way home i stopped as is my
custom at the public library it was
late when i returned to bed as i
opened my window i noticed that the
bay window was dark and presumed of
course that the man and woman had
retired


the dark brown dress
  now i am an early riser sir i very
often do two or three hours work be-
fore breakfast
  here he pulled a handkerchief from
his pocket and mopped his head
  mr meroe he said strangely and
evidently quite carried away with a
vivid memory this morning i com-
menced to write as usual soon came
the first light of dawn i kept on writ-
ing then it grew lighter and i turned
off the desk lamp    and dear
god man he said hoarsely i looked
out of the window-i looked out of the
window and    there she was-
that woman-still staring at me and
the head of the man was above the back
of the settee in exactly the same posi-
tion
  i leaned forward with a glance at
meroe
  and what did you do mr grover
he was asking
  i went directly over to the claridge
sir but the janitor said that i was-er-
crazy and would not listen to me
whats more he would not let me in to
wake up the manager so i returned
to my room to make sure that i had not
been dreaming being perfectly satis-
fied that this was not the case i decided
to appeal to you if you will come di-
rectly to my room i am confident that
you will find things just as i have
stated
  and it is your opinion mr grover
that a crime has been committed
why yes-er-well that of course
is one possibility
  come said meroe putting the
screen in front of the fireplace we will
go immediately
  once in the room grover advanced
quickly to the window and uttered an
exclamation of astonishment for the
room behind the third bay window op-
posite was the scene of a commotion
  meroe bolted for the door with the
two of us at his heels
  the office of the claridge was empty
not waiting to ring for the elevator
meroe rushed up six flights of stairs
  i	followed him leaving grover blus-
tering and far behind
  we made our way toward the sound
of voices down the hall and stood in
the doorway of a room facing a dozen
or more people meroe showed them
his badge of authority mr barhart
manager of the hotel stood forth as
main spokesman i was surprised to
find that all in the room were alive and
on their feet and noticed that meroe
was also somewhat disturbed at this
  where are the bodies he asked
addressing mr barhart who seemed
rather astounded that meroe had ar-
rived upon the scene and could not
quite understand how he had known
that there were bodies in the case when
he himself had just discovered them
  why we carried them to the bed in
the other room he replied and sent
for the house doctor
  has he been here 
  he lias examined them sir in fact
he is still in the room with them
were they dead 
  apparently quite lifeless
  then you should not have removed
them until the arrival of the proper au-
thorities mr barhart have you noti-
fied the police
  the police mr barhart was quite
taken aback it had not occurred to
me that there was need to notify the
police i was about to notify the friends
of these people and arrange with the
undertaker 
  then it had not occurred to you mr
barhart that a crime had been com-
mitted 
  there was a murmuring of voices
among the assembly at the end of the
room among which were guests of the
hotel two or three maids the elevator
boy and the telephone girl
  a crime exclaimed the manager
the dark brown dress

these unfortunate people have been
ill fifteen minutes ago a telegram
came for mr brentore and as they did
not answer the phone i myself came
up to see what was the matter i found
them dead mrs brentore in the chair
here and mr brentore on the settee by
the window
  out of the corner of my eye i saw
that grover had caught up with us and
was standing in the doorway
  what was the doctors verdict
asked meroe of barhart at this point
  that they both had died of heart
trouble perhaps after having eaten a
very heavy meal he replied
  oh but they were not present in the
dining-room at dinner time interrupted
one of the guests
  meroe beckoned to grover
  mr barhart this man occupies a
room on the sixth floor of the buck-
minster very nearly opposite these win-
dows yesterday afternoon he saw mr
and mrs brentore in the positions in
which you have informed me they were
found this morning early this morn-
ing he saw them in the same position
he rushed here to notify you your
janitor laughed at him called him crazy
and refused to let him wake you i am-
sorry mr barljart but i will have to
ask all of you to remain in this room
until i have investigated the situation a
little more closely  
  the telephone girl stepped forward
and held up her hand
  lee harmon the janitor has disap-
peared she said he was seen by
miss lougee the night operator at
about six shortly after that there was
a call for him about a water fixture but
he was not to be found
  just then the doctor stepped forth
from the bedroom
  these gentlemen are here under the
impression that a crime has been com-
mitted said barhart with a sweep of
the hand toward the three of us
 and perhaps-perhaps we are
wrong said grover with his rasping
voice i was the one who suggested the
idea i was very suspicious and con-
sulted mr meroe immediately know-
ing that lie if anyone could throw light
on the subject but-but perhaps i was
over-hasty-yes perhaps i was over-
hasty 	s
  there is every evidence of a natural
death said the doctor
  you are sure there were no marks of
violence asked meroe
  absolutely mr meroe i have ex-
amined the bodies very carefully be-
sides they were found in a peaceful
position one in the chair and one on the
settee this would hardly indicate a
death by violence no the deaths were
undoubtedly caused by heart failure al-
though i am at a loss to know the exact
nature of this heart failure there is a
total lack of other indications
  does it not strike you as odd doc-
tor said meroe that the two deaths
should have occurred simultaneously
at first yes but on second thought
no he replied they were both in a
weak condition and in sitting convers-
ing with each other as was evidently
the case if one were to die suddenly it
would not be unnatural that the shock
of the discovery should cause heart
failure in the other
  meroe shook his head doubtfully
and you are absolutely certain that
they were not poisoned  he asked
  no i am not absolutely certain
that they were not poisoned was the
reply but i willassist in performing
an autopsy this morning if you wish
please make arrangements to do
that said meroe and i will notify
the coroner at once and by the way
doctor mr barhart informs me that
mr and mrs brentore had been ill
may i ask what was the nature of that
illness 
  that i do not know mr meroe

the dark brown dress
although i am the house doctor mr
and mrs brentore were in the habit of
consulting a doctor by the name of kra-
mer i know nothing about him other
than his name and his distinctly odd per-
sonal appearance
  meroe turned to the gathering at the
end of the room
  is there testimony to be volunteered
illustrative of the case as it stands he
asked does anyone know where dr
kramer may be found 
i have heard mrs brentore call dr
kramer on the phone said the tele-
phone girl he lives at the braymore
when was dr kramer last seen in
this building
  he passed through the office to the
elevator yesterday afternoon she an-
swered
  i took him up to this floor sir said
the elevator boy then an elderly wo-
man stepped forward
  my rooms are across the hall she
said and  saw him enter the room
it was about four oclock
  and how long did he remain here
i do not know but later in the
afternoon shortly after five i saw the
janitor come out of mrs brentores
room i thought nothing of it at the
time but perhaps it will prove to have
some bearing on the matter now that
the janitor is supposed to have disap-
peared
  i am quite sure that it will have a
bearing said meroe and now mr
barhart may i please see the telegram
which caused you to seek an entrance to
these rooms this morning
  meroe read the message which mr
barhart handed him and then dismissed
all except barhart and grover
  as the gathering dispersed meroe led
me into the bedroom to examine the
bodies they were stretched side by
side upon the bed under a sheet the
clothing was on a chair i thought i
heard meroe utter an exclamation as he
held up the dress of the woman then
he turned to the bodies the skin of
each of them was ashy pale and the lips
were almost a pale slate color
  it is hard to believe that they died
of heart failure i whispered it ap-
pears to me that the doctor and mr
barhart are very much interested in
proving that a crime has not been com-
mitted
  meroe did not answer he was on
his way to the phone to notify the cor-
oner
  when he returned he proceeded to
examine the bodies very minutely from
head to foot once he poked me and
pointed to the lower arm of the woman
near the elbow
  it looks like a needle-prick i whis-
pered
  meroe then went over the arms of the
man very carefully but found nothing
  suddenly he poked me again and
pointed to the mans left leg
  there was the same little mark which
looked like a needle-prick
  do you think they have been poi-
soned  whispered
  the coroner will soon find out he
answered
  and then we joined mr grover and
mr barhart who had remained in the
sitting-room of the suite
  meroe sat down to examine the con-
tents of the desk i saw him put an en-
velope in his pocket
  mr barhart said meroe what
can you tell me of this janitor lee har-
mon who was seen to depart from this
room yesterday afternoon who would
not permit mr grover to notify you of
his suspicions this morning and who has
since then disappeared 
  i know absolutely nothing about
him mr meroe except that we have
employed him for little more than a
month
  did he come to you with recommen-
dations 
the dark brown dress

  his only recommendation was from
-well now thats funny it hadnt
struck me before-his only recommen-
dation was from dr kramer
  hm i see well how long have
mr and mrs brentore been guests at
the claridge
  three years this next month
  and how long has dr kramer been
attending them
  just this fall before that i do not
believe they were in need of medical
advice if so it did not come under my
observation
  and mr and mrs brentore were
quite wealthy
  very wealthy mr meroe
  as soon as the coroner arrives mr
barhart i will leave to make some fur-
ther investigations of my own i will
return at two oclock please see that
all the available witnesses are present
and-you are still of the opinion
that a crime has been committed mr
meroe
  i would rather not answer that mr
barhart until i have received the coro-
ners statement    and mr gro-
ver there is nothing to keep you now
but inasmuch as you are one of the chief
witnesses i shall ask you to be present
at two this afternoon
  really you know he rasped per-
haps i have been over-hasty i would
not wish to be the cause of unnecessary
trouble by suggesting that a crime had
been committed when-when-
  you were certainly the early bird this
time mr meroe chuckled a voice in
the doorway
  it was the coroner
ii
  at the office of the braymore which
was next door to the buckminster
meroe made inquiries about dr kramer
he had occupied room number seventy-
five on the seventh floor for two months
was not seen very often was in the
habit of spending long hours sometimes
days in his room with the door locked
and had been known to refuse to answer
messages or telephone calls they knew
nothing whatsoever of his practice were
not even sure that he possessed one the
last seen of him was the afternoon be-
fore when he had returned to his room
after having been away for two or three
hours
  there was an automatic elevator in
the braymore this we took to the
sevendi floor we knocked at the door
of seventy-five but there was no answer
we tried to open it but it was locked
meroe called a maid
  dr kramer does not permit us to
enter his room unless he calls us sir
she said but handed him the pass key
the door was bolted from the inside
and would not open
  i think said meroe that we can
get in through the window if you will
let us into a room which opens out onto
the roof of the buckminster there is
no space between the two buildings
  he was not mistaken after climbing
out of room seventy-two we encircled a
small court and came to the window of
dr kramers room which was closed
but unfastened
  inside there was nothing-absolutely
nothing belonging to dr kramer the
drawers were open and crumpled paper
littered the floor as if he had packed
very hurriedly
  so dr kramer has disappeared
too muttered meroe
  outside meroe handed me the tele-
gram which had been sent to mr bren-
tore it was from brattlenook new
jersey and dated november the twenty-
ninth
    evidently you did not receive for-
  mer telegram it read latimer dis-
  appeared four months ago in face of
  heavy debts advise you retract will
  immediately

the dark brown dress
  it was signed r goodnow
  harding is their lawyer said me-
roe drawing from his pocket the en-
velope he had found in brentores desk
if you will wire r goodnow of the
death of mr and mrs brentore i will
run up to see harding and tend to one
or two other matters then we will
meet at marstons at twelve-thirty for a
bite of lunch before ending this curious
little story about the woman in a dark
brown dress who stared at henry
grover 
  there was an odd smile on meroes
face but before i could speak he was
striding down the street away from me
	 
  shortly before twelve-thirty i seated
myself in the lobby of marstons to wait
for meroe at twelve-fifty-five he came
through the door as if he had been hur-
rying his brows were puckered and he
appeared distressed
  what news i asked
  that there were absolutely no traces
of poison he replied leading me quick-
ly to a table in the corner
  then-then the whole thing is a
farce-i mean about the crime part of
it what about the janitor and kramer
what about barhart and the house doc-
tor  
  but meroe did not answer after
giving our order he leaned back in his
chair with his chin sunk to his chest in
deep thought
  there is not much time he said i
must make some sort of a showing at
two oclock or the reputation of a years
hard work will be seriously injured
   not that i really care he
added with a curious light in his eyes
and a slow shaking of the head
  what did you find from harding
i asked but again he was lost in thought
and did not hear me
  we ate in silence then we sat in
silence
  i looked at my watch it was after
one-thirty
  suddenly meroe leaned over to touch
my arm
  do you remember he asked slowly
if those needle-pricks were directly
over one of the large veins
  no i answered no i did not
think to notice
  it all hinges upon that he said let
us go
  we arrived at the claridge a moment
before two the elevator boy was wait-
ing for us
  they are all upstairs lie said
  as we approached the door to the
room i could see that indeed they were
all within all who had been present in
the morning at the side of the door
was larkin from headquarters he
stepped down the hall to meet us
  they tell me mr meroe he re-
marked drily that you are attempting
to build a murder out of a case of heart
failure
  perhaps smiled meroe making his
way through the door and on past the
assembly into the bedroom
  he was followed with curious eyes
in a moment he appeared again there
was a blank expression on his face as he
looked at the coroner
  the bodies have been removed mr
meroe he was informed
  are they with jordan
  yes
  then i must phone jordan
  as meroe disappeared there was a
great murmur of voices upon his re-
turn he stepped behind the table on the
left of which were the coroner bar-
hart grover and the house doctor
  i will begin said meroe by telling
you what i have been able to discover
about mr and mrs brentore the de-
ceased they were a lonely childless
couple at one time poor five years ago
mr brentore came into sudden wealth
through interests in an african diamond
the dark brown dress

project he had originally been a jew-
eler of no great repute forced to strug-
gle to make food and clothing above the
rent of the shop three years ago he
sold his business and retired with his
wife to this suite at the claridge to live
until old age should overtake them
which they did not expect would be
very many j-ears
  the nearest relative to either of
them was an elder sister of mr bren-
tore who died in brattlenook new jer-
sey leaving a grown son by the name
of roderick latimer of the character
of this man i will not venture to speak
other than that he took a great interest
in the suddenly acquired fortune of his
uncle brentore whom he had never
seen
  one day a man by the name of dr
kramer registered at the hotel bray-
more he was from brattlenook new
jersey he called upon mr and mrs
brentore telling them that their nephew
roderick latimer was one of his best
friends and had asked him to call upon
them mr brentore was immediately
interested for he had often wished to
know more of this nephew than he had
heard from his sister before her death
  one evening dr kramer called
again and found mrs brentore indis-
posed he volunteered his services say-
ing that he had given up his practice
upon leaving brattlenook but would be
very glad to render service to either of
them at any time it might be needed
curiously enough mr and mrs bren-
tore from then on became more and
more in need of these services their
health commenced to fail as time went
on there came a thought which very
often comes to men of failing health who
are burdened with wealth he had not
made a will perhaps yes perhaps this
was even suggested by dr kramer at
least they talked together about this
nephew who was brentores only rela-
tive
   b m-dec-
  a decision was at hand but he
was evidently not satisfied with second-
hand knowledge of this latimer from
one who had been a stranger until so
recently there was an old boyhood
friend of mr brentores living in brat-
tlenook his name was goodnow he
telegraphed asking goodnow to look up
latimer and report results by wire
this was done and the report received
by brentore was favorable so he made
an appointment with harding of the
mentor building to draw up the will
then he telegraphed goodnow to in-
form latimer of what he had done and
to ask him latimer to come at his earli-
est opportunity at his brentores ex-
pense for a short visit here at the
claridge
  that was yesterday goodnow sent
a night letter to brentore which arrived
this morning in endeavoring to see
that mr brentore received this message
mr barhart discovered both mr and
mrs brentore dead i will read you the
message
   evidently you did not receive for-
mer telegram latimer disappeared four
months ago in face of heavy debts ad-
vise you retract will immediately
  now brentore had received a favor-
able report apparently from goodnow
so you see the unfavorable telegram had
been intercepted and the favorable one
substituted i found from western
union that the correct telegram left
their office
  now at this point let me remind you
that dr kramer was seen to enter this
room yesterday afternoon at four that
the janitor who came here a month ago
with only dr kramers recommendation
was seen to leave this room at about five
this morning it was discovered that the
janitor had disappeared and since then
i have discovered something which may
interest you-i e that dr kramer has
disappeared from his quarters at the
braymore 

the dark brown dress
iii
  there was a murmuring at this and
meroe waited for it to subside before
he continued
  much of the above information not
obtainable here at the claridge i ob-
tained from frank s harding whom i
discovered to be the lawyer engaged to
draw up the will some of it i have in-
ferred as necessary to make the tale co-
herent and now we will approach
what i still choose to consider a mystery
from another angle   
  it has to do with henry grover here
who carnc to me at six-thirty this morn-
ing over half an hour before mr bar-
hart had entered the room mr grover
occupies a room directly opposite this
one at the buckminster he came to me
rather distressed because yesterday af-
ternoon at five or a little after he had
been disturbed by the figure of a woman
with slightly gray hair and a dark brown
dress who stared at him from this room
soon he discovered that she was not
staring at him but at a man who was
evidently talking to her and whose head
he could see above the back of the settee
in the window
  it had bothered him so much how-
ever that he stopped work and went out
for a walk he remained for supper
and did not return until dark not see-
ing a light in this window he presumed
that the inmates had retired for the
night but early this morning he dis-
covered them in exactly the same posi-
tion the position in which they were
found later by mr barhart rushing
over to the claridge he was stopped by
the janitor who laughed at him called
him crazy and refused to allow him to
wake up the manager not long after
this the janitor disappeared mr grover
came to me at six-thirty told me the
story and requested that i accompany
him to his room to see for myself when
we arrived we found that the situation
had already been discovered so we
made our way to the scene as quickly
as possible
  at first my suspicions were aroused
at the reluctance with which the house
doctor and mr barhart accepted even
the remotest suggestion that a crime had
been committed i have since however
come to he conclusion that it was but
a natural instinct on the part of parties
interested in the business end of the
establishment to avoid encroachment
upon its good name
  there was a slight bow of acknowl-
edgment from barhart
  it surprised me a great deal to be in-
formed that there were absolutely no in-
dications of a death other than natural
so i examined the bodies myself and
found what it would be only too easy
to overlook that which i had every rea-
son to suspect was the mark of a hypo-
dermic needle there was one on the
arm of the woman and one on the leg of
the man
  i was therefore doubly surprised and
disconcerted when the coroner informed
me that there were absolutely no traces
of drug or poison things had come to
my notice which left no doubt whatso-
ever in my own mind that the whole
thing was a very clever conspiracy or
plot but the whole framework of my
theory would fall away if mr and mrs
brentore had died a natural death
  it all depended upon one fact when
i rushed through to the bedroom a while
ago it was to verify this the bodies
were gone i called up jordan and
asked him to look for the needle marks
and tell me if they were situated each of
them over a laree vein his answer was
yes
  now is it not true doctor that if air
is introduced into a large vein it may be
carried in the venous circulation to the
right ventricle and be then forced by
the systole of the latter into the pul-
monary artery or its primary branches
the dark brown dress

acting like a clot possibly even produc-
ing a clot  
  it is mr meroe that would be what
is termed an air embolism it would
have somewhat the same effect as phle-
bitis of a large vein  
  and it would produce death
  it would
  and the face and surface of the vic-
tim would be ashy pale with the lips and
mucous membrane a pale slate color as
was the case with the bodies in ques-
tion 
  either that or the face would be
livid and bluish and in some cases the
limbs are convulsed
  and there was nothing in your ex-
amination of these bodies with which
you could contradict my statement that
death was caused by the introduction of
air into a large vein by means of an
empty or partially empty hypodermic
needle thus leaving the marks which i
discovered on examining the bodies this
morning
  nothing mr meroe it is a thing
which had not occurred to me before in
relation to this particular case it is
only in exceptional cases that there are
any distinctive signs to be found on
physical examination
  and how long after the introduction
of the air would death occur
  death might take place in a very few
moments not due to mere asphyxia-but
in some degree at any rate to syn-
cope-
  now with the doctors word in sup-
port of my theory said meroe turning
to the others i advance the tentative
hypothesis that mr and mrs brentore
were murdered deliberately by the ma-
lignant introduction of air into a large
vein now as this could not very well
be accomplished without their consent
or without drugging them or binding
them i suggest that it was accomplished
upon the pretext of injecting a medicine
applicable to an ailment from which
they believed themselves to be suffering
at the time
  there was a moments silence
  but could one die such a death mr
meroe interrupted the rasping voice
of mr grover and remain in the natu-
ial sitting posture in which i saw them
as early as yesterday afternoon and in
which mr barhart found them this
morning
  they could not answered meroe
and for that reason i was about to offer
the additional suggestion that after hav-
ing been successfully murdered in this
unusual way the bodies were placed in
a sitting posture as nearly natural as
possible and why  it would seem that
one would not take the trouble to do
this without a perfectly definite and un-
doubtedly ingeniously conceived pur-
pose it is this and one other point
which have led me to some rather star-
tling conclusions since seven oclock this
morning there is in this room at this
moment one who will verify all that i
am saying
  did it not strike you as suggestive
that the lady across the hall should have
seen dr kramer enter this room and
the janitor depart from it i leave you
to draw your own conclusions from this
and the fact that when one disappears
both disappear and who would derive
the greatest benefit from the death of
mr and mrs brentore would it not
certainly be the nephew roderick lati-
mer who disappeared from brattlenook
in the face of heavy debts who else
would spend weeks of patient labor on
a plan to hasten the preparation of the
will and immediately after that the
death of these people
  at this point i offer as another sug-
gestion that roderick latimer dr kra-
mer and lee harmon the janitor are
one and the same person-
  there was another burst of murmur-
ing there was a slightly sarcastic
smile on the face of larkin

the dark brown dress
  -and that in the person of the jani-
tor he was able to intercept the telegram
the receipt of which would have ruined
his chances of being named in the will
and that in the person of the doctor he
was able to commit the murder at the
proper time and without any great out-
cry
  mr meroe said larkin suddenly
most of what you have given us clever
and coherent though it is is mere theory
have you proof of what you say can
you lead us to the murderer
  if the case ended at that point i
would not have proof of what i say i
would not be able to lead you to the mur-
derer but roderick latimer did not
stop there he went a step farther he
went a step too far in an effort to
protect himself without having to flee
the country entirely he had conceived a
plan which was entirely too perfect for
him to carry out without a flaw he
knew that the best way to escape de-
tection and still be on the ground until
such time as it was safe for him to re-
sume the character of roderick latimer
pay his debts and take up the life of a
wealthy and righteous citizen-was to
be right under the nose and on the side
of the detector this would have been
very successful had he been the master-
mind to think of all the details at once
he was not that perfect master-mind
and now lee harmon dr kramer
roderick latimer and henry grover
what have you to say for yourself
iv
  there was a general outcry of as-
tonishment henry grover looked about
him and up at meroe in utter amaze-
ment there was another sarcastic
smile on the face of larkin
  you would look more like yourself
without that on said meroe reaching
for the hair which grew out of the mole
above grovers left eye but it did not
budge grover uttered an exclamation
of pain and arose in indignation
  come out of it latimer said
meroe it will not help you now to
put up a bluff you came to me at six-
thirty you were in a hurry as you ac-
costed the telephone girl at the charles-
gate club you were not in a hurry
when once you had entered my room
you made your story entirely too
dramatic to get away with it naturally
you described the woman as having
slightly gray hair and a dark brown
dress it was when i found that her
hair was really only slightly gray and
that her dress was a very dark brown
that i got the hunch about your whole
game i defy any man to sit in your
room at the buckminster and tell mrs
brentores dark brown dress from a
black one while it is hanging over a
chair in the center of this room and
it would be equally impossible to recog-
nize her hair as slightly gray without
having seen it at very close range and
when i found that the window of
kramers room at the braymore opened
onto the roof of the buckminster not
far from the stairway leading down to
the sixth floor your floor i was con-
vinced also you were too eager to
retract your suggestion that a crime had
been committed after seeing the possi-
bility of its being considered other-
wise  
  now lets see whether that mole will
not come off it doesnt look quite
natural to me your ideas of disguise
are a bit crude for this day and age i
wish i had seen you as dr kramer and
the janitor 
  grover had backed away from meroe
suddenly the coroner reached up for the
mole grover jerked away with another
exclamation but the mole was left be-
hind held up to view in the coroners
fingers
  do you deny anything that i have
said asked meroe do you deny
the dark brown dress

that you kept a room at both the bray-
more and the buckminster and man-
aged to keep up the appearance of living
in both of them by means of the stair-
way in the roof do you deny that for
the past month you have worked your-
self to death as lee harmon janitor of
the oaridge in order to be the more
certain of success in your little plan
  i felt a real tinge of pity for the man
as he hung his head suddenly he
looked up
  perhaps it would help clear mat-
ters he said in a strained but quiet
voice if i showed you just exactly
what was done in the case for instance
of the woman
  he reached in his hip pocket and
drew forth a little box he removed
from it a hypodermic needle
  it was this vein he said pointing
to his arm with the point of the
needle   
  we watched him with gaping mouths
half stupefied by the strange tones of
his voice suddenly meroe lurched to-
ward him but it was too late the
needle was in his vein and his thumb
was pressing home
  i would rather not be bothered with
the red tape of a trial he said quietly
	 
  i	will not describe in detail the
scene which followed there were
screams from the women and somewhat
of a panic as they rushed from the room
he did not live more than fifteen
minutes
  meroe left the rest in the hands of
larkin and the coroner we walked
home through the park breathing clean
air and sunshine to clear our souls of
the unwholesomeness with which we had
been steeped since morning
  you know said meroe he would
have slipped away with the whole thing
right under our noses if he had not
described the woman who stared at him
as having been dressed in a dark brown
dress
  and that was the last i ever heard
meroe mention of the aflair for it was
his custom to forget these things as soon
as his part had been played
in full payment

i
chu kwong listened respect-
fully to the words of his father
my son the old man be-
gan it is written in the books
of great wisdom that a son gains virtue
who pays his fathers debts harken
then to the story i shall tell you thus
knowing your fathers debt it may
chance that you can pay it in the land
of the white barbarians whither you
go in the train of my most honorable
and elder brother fong su
  the old man pulled gently at his pipe
watching the thin spiral of smoke as-
cend toward the cloud-flecked sky
he was silent until recalled to the
present by the discreet cough of chu
kwong he continued
  it happened in the days before this
disease called democracy descended
upon the middle kingdom and the
daughter of heaven still graced the
golden throne
  it was my task to administer justice
in the city of tsen pien one day
there were led before me five evil men
who had brought great pain to the hon-
est citizens by their robberies and their
murders i listened to the stories
against them and because they seemed
to be true stories i sentenced them to
be flogged and then hung
  but in the night they escaped from
their jail and coming to my house
sought revenge upon me for having
passed just sentence and they would
have succeeded in their evil purpose had
it not been for a certain white bar-
barian who was my guest with the

aid of his weapons he fought against
them killing four and wounding the
fifth
  strange are the ways of these while
barbarians this man who had saved
my life would accept neither gold nor
presents of any kind therefore i am
in his debt which is a burdensome slate
to an honest man
  before leaving my house this man
presented me with this card which
bears his likeness and his name written
in a strange hand take it with you
so that should he cross your path you
may know him and perchance befriend
him as he befriended your father
  chu kwong bowed low and prepared
to withdraw but his father stopped
him saying
  one other thing my son in this
land to which you go there is a dog of
a cantonese to whom i lent some hun-
dreds of taels he has not returned
them it is also written that a son gains
virtue who collects all that is owing to
his father it may be that from this
li sing there will be no money forth-
coming but a man can pay in other
ways now you may retire
ii
  when he was just past forty greg-
ory westlake came into his inheritance
he returned to london after a career
of hardship and adventure pursued in
many lands he settled down in his
fathers house and prepared to enjoy
himself
  and for a season he did enjoy him-
self the renewal of old friendships
in full payment

the making of new ones the going
about to this house and that the solid
comfort of english life plus an income
that was more than sufficient for his
needs-all these were as balm to his
hitherto lonely and harassed spirit
then he married lady miriam stone-
wald and began a sojourn in a garden
of sorrow
  who ever solved the riddle that was
miriam stonewald no one ill
wager unless it was a man or woman
who could solve the mysteries of the
sea for like the sea beside which she
was born she was unfathomable often
unexpectedly kind often senselessly
cruel and always inconstant as a sum-
mer breeze
  she was beautiful and she had wealth
and a pretty taste in clothes but be-
sides she had charm and no one who
ever came under its influence ever for-
got her ever quite ceased to be her
slave
  it is a mystery why she married
gregory westlake certainly she did
not love him nor was it his income
that attracted her since it totalled less
than a fifth of her own perhaps it
was as lady cooper put it oh west-
lake just chanced to be around when
the whim to marry seized dear miriam
  stored up in westlakes heart was all
the love and affection accumulated by a
man who has lived a lonely life in
strange lands all of it he lavished on
his wife he gave her himself wholly
and for eternity and the greater trag-
edy was not that she refused his gift
but that she seemed unaware that it had
been offered a week after they were
married she went her usual way - a
ceaseless round of receptions dinners
dances-and her husband had become
simply another of those possessions one
has but doesnt think about
  it was shortly after her return from
the glencairn shooting that she met
an undersecretary at the chinese em-
bassy a certain chu kvvong who was
greatly the rage because he could sing
exotic love-songs to strange chinese
music
  oh do bring the dear child over and
present him she said to her host at the
spanish ambassadors reception
  don ruy diaz laughed and sent one
of his aides to fetch the good-looking
young chinaman
  when chu kwong heard lady mir-
iams name he smiled pleasantly into
her eyes
  your father-perhaps he is mr
gregory westlake he asked in his
soft almost feminine voice
  that is my husbands name lady
miriam replied
  chu kwong clasped his hands to-
gether and bowed very low
  then we should be friends madam
since already i am your husbands
friend
  you know my husband
  alas  madam chu kwong an-
swered nevertheless i am his friend
  and bowing again he moved slowly
away
  intrigued by his perfect self-posses-
sion his quaint manner lady miriam
determined to add chu kwong to the
host of her admirers
  it was not a difficult task chu
kwong was at the age of idealism when
any pretty woman who will listen to a
young mans hopes and aspirations is
an angel in disguise and lady mir-
iam had the knack of listening
  she let him come to tea and over the
cups draw her a picture of a new china
with himself in the foreground holding
a very important position indeed she
let him bring her little presents-queer
fans of sandalwood and ornaments of
apple-green iade it was her whim to
captivate him and she gratified it
  chu kwongs attitude toward west-

in full payment
lake was odd gifted with the orien-
tals ability to penetrate to anothers
moods he saw clearly beneath west-
lakes mask of nonchalance he saw
that the man was unhappy-unspeak-
ably so and not knowing that the
cause was lady miriams indifference
and neglect he was possessed with a
measure of contempt for his fathers
friend
  to a chinaman possession of a de-
sirable woman is more than nine points
of the law it is the law complete
how then could a man married to
lady miriam living in the same house
with her privileged to enjoy the thou-
sand and one intimacies of such living
dare to be anything but overwhelmingly
joyous did it not augur a lack of
taste and appreciation for so enviable
a being to be unhappy
  nevertheless chu kwong bound by
filial devotion never lost sight of the
fact that it was to this englishman that
his father owed his life and always
his eyes were open seeking here seek-
ing the opportunity to pay his fathers
debt
  and it came about that one afternoon
he called at the westlake house to es-
cort lady miriam to a sale at christies
the servant put him in the little draw-
ing-room behind which was westlakes
library
  for a little chu kwong sat beside the
window looking out into the quiet
street then growing restless he rose
and began pacing up and down the
length of the room as he neared the
folding door leading to the library he
heard voices
  matters of morals and good taste
vary greatly a chinaman can listen
behind a closed door without forfeiting
his self-respect so chu kwong stood
very still and listened
  a mans voice that chu kwong had
never heard before was speaking
      and from there well take
native boats to the rivers source the
shooting is bound to be good will you
come gregory
  and westlake replied
  sorry old chap like to and all
that but i-i cant
  there was silence for a minute
then the strange voice broke out its
tones impatient
  i know what it is i think that you
are hugging your misery to your heart
forgive me for speaking like this
gregory but-well damn it all i hate
to see a good chap come a cropper be-
cause a petticoat cant see hes the finest
man on two continents
  there was the sound of a chair being
pushed back followed by an exclama-
tion from westlake
  gad man it isnt pretty is it-to
see your pal making all kinds of an ass
of himself
  he laughed then his voice became
serious
  but truly you dont understand
no man could who hadnt been in the
same boat miriam is in my blood-
like that damnable african fever and
you cant get rid of it and you cant
forget it-ever i know im not wanted
here wouldnt even be missed if i
trekked anywhere but-well i cant
go
  see here he went on after a short
pause to no other man on earth would
i tell these tilings do you know that
sometimes i am almost ready to pray
for miriams death so that once irrevo-
cably separated from her i can pull my-
self together and be my own -man
again
  then someone entered the library
and the conversation ceased
  that evening chu kwong sat long
and motionless absorbed in his
thoughts knowledge ideas sugges-
tions that had come to him from hear-
in full payment

ing westlake talking to his friend
crowded his brain and bewildered him
one by one he sorted them and weighed
them and placed them in their proper
relationship and it seemed to him
when he was done that his duty was
clear
 then in his whole being there raged
 a battle between duty and desire it
 lasted until the dawn had lighted up
 the chimney-pots and paled the stars
 it left chu kwong exhausted but
 around his lips there were lines of pur-
 pose and determination
 the next morning he visited li sing
 importer of teas and spices and perhaps
 a little of the juice of the yellow poppy
after he and his host had accom-
plished the necessary ceremonies of
greeting he came to the purpose of his
call
 li sing he said there is a debt of
 money that you owe my father
the other chinaman moved his huge
bulk uneasily he coughed behind his
hand shaking his head sadly
 that is true o elder brother
and you can pay
li sing grew still more embar-
rassed
 my business is poor son of an illus-
 trious father and i have no money
chu kwongs eyes narrowed
debts may be paid in other ways
than with money he suggested
 li sings face brightened
 what is it that you wish me to do
chu kwong leaned over him and
whispered a sentence or two into his
ear
 the other man sprang to his feet
no no he cried that is im-
possible
why
 li sing stretched forth his hands ap-
 pealingly
but can you not see there is the
danger to my life
  chu kwong sitting as immovable as
an idol looked at him coldly
  but there is the danger to your
honor if you do not do as i have asked
he said brutally shall your ancestors
lose face because you are a cheat and a
coward 
  then li sing fell upon his knees and
pleaded but to all his offers and pro-
testations chu kwong turned a deaf
ear his eyes were veiled with the mist
of incomprehension as though he could
not understand the others words
  at last li sing rose he made a
little gesture of defeat
  i will do as you have ordered he
said quietly
  that is well chu kwong replied
  then he too rose and departed
ill
  chu kwong again stood humbly be-
fore his father
  my father he said i have paid
your debt to the white barbarian and
also i have collected that which li sing
owed you
  the old man nodded his head gently
  you have done well my son tell
me now the details
  chu kwong cleared his throat
  i found the white barbarian sick o
my father and i removed from his
person that which was gnawing at his
heart i permitted li sing to be my
servant in the matter and for his ser-
vices absolved him from his debt
  he drew forth a clipping from a
london newspaper and translating
slowly read it to his father
  all london was shocked by the brutal
murder of lady miriam westlake the hor-
rible event took place last night as the de-
ceased was leaving the haymarket theatre
 the company of her husband according
to witnesses a short stout man sprang from
the crowd and silently plunged a long knife
into her back in the ensuing excitement
the assailant escaped and there was no one

in full payment
who saw his face clearly enough to identify
him charles hornby baker of reading
swears that the man was a chinaman but
inspector grant who is investigating the
case believes this to be highly improbable
  chu kwong folded the clipping and
returned it to his pocket then he
looked gravely at his father
  the old man removed the stem of his
pipe from between his lips and spat
contemplatively
  i do not quite follow all the details
 of this matter my son he said but
 undoubtedly you have done well
 chu kwong half turned away
 and if in paying your debt o my
 father i have paid it partly with my
 hearts blood have i acquired virtue
 the old man nodded
 you have acquired great virtue my
 son
 chu kwong bowed his head
 perhaps that is so he said softly
the man who knew too much
                        by john d swain
i
jtrpihe trouble with me said the
last patient of the day is that
 i know too much
          the statement did not sur-
prise arbuthnot the consulting alienist
the patient who had just left his office
had assured him that he was perfectly
all right save for a glass heart which he
lived in constant terror of cracking by
colliding with somebody or by slipping
on a wet pavement
  before him there had been a pretty
girl bubbling with enthusiasm over a
scheme for curing stammerers by intra-
venal injections of parrots blood and
so it went every afternoon from two
until four arbuthnot elevated his
brows politely and gazed upon the pale
emaciated man of sixty-odd who faced
him across the wide table
  you know too much-about what
everything big things and trifles
all my senses are abnormally keen
without in the least wishing to do so
i overheard all your conversation with
the patients who preceded me through
your soundproof door coming down-
town i passed seven hundred and thir-
teen pedestrians and i could describe
each one so minutely that any reason-
ably intelligent police officer could iden-
tify him at sight on the street cars i
can hear the ticking of every watch
and distinguish the minute differences
in beat and pitch yesterday i rode
for two miles along the principal busi-
ness street of a jersey city i can write
out for you every sign every scrap of
lettering on the shop fronts of the side
i was facing along the entire route
when i smell a perfume i at once
identify each of the dozen or more coal-
tar derivatives from which it has been
built up
  dr arbuthnot nodded
  i have treated cases not unlike
yours he said there is no cause
for alarm you are probably overwork-
ing drop everything and play for a
while golf or long tramps in the
country
  no use i should count the apples
on the trees and if i laid down to rest
i	should hear the grass grow and the
earthworms burrowing far beneath i
can stand it daytimes but of late my
mind retains its activity until i sink into
a sort of stupor toward dawn i am
sixty-three and ive never used drugs
of any sort now i want something
to make me sleep at least every other
night
  the alienist made the customary ex-
amination with stethoscope and opthal-
moscope tested his reflexes and ques-
tioned him upon his family history
  john slades father had been of a
type not uncommon in rural new en-
gland although dying out self-taught
save for what the village academy could
impart he knew a little about many
things he was a naturalist of sorts
was always pointing out glacial
scratches on the rocks in the neighbor-
hood and finding indian arrowheads
had a fine collection of butterflies and
knew them all by their latin names
botanized a great deal by day and read
the stars by night through a rusty old
telescope understood the ways of


the man who knew too much
fishes and wood creatures could en-
joy his new testament in both greek
and latin with his hands he was able
to repair sewing machines pumps type-
writers or clocks and could design and
build a modest house unaided knew
surveying and served as the local un-
dertaker with two or three simple
tools he could do things that would have
baffled a master mechanic-yet could
not have passed an examination as
plumbers assistant a gentle vision-
ary man the only resident of his county
to whom spinoza and descartes and
einstein meant anything at all he lived
and died as poor as a church mouse
  slades mother was a french-cana-
dian unable to read or write she had
the illiterate peasants extraordinary
powers of minute observation was a
neat housewife a mixture of cunning
and credulity and a devout christian
  john slade himself cared nothing for
money when he needed any he in-
vented something his education be-
gun by tramping the countryside with
his father and absorbing all sorts of ill-
assorted facts had been pursued in
many lands at one time he buried
himself in johns hopkins engrossed in
biology and embryology next he was
heard of at oxford steeped in medie-
valism physics at leipsic and prague
chemistry at bonn back again to the
states he flitted from massachusetts
tech to the edison laboratories al-
ways learning never producing-save
when lack of funds drove him to some
hack work a course of lectures before
the lowell institute the invention of a
crankless ice-cream freezer an article
for some technical publication
  i know too much he repeated after
answering all of arbuthnots questions
that is the trouble and now i cannot
sleep
  the physician gave him some advice
as to exercise and diet to which he lis-
tened abstractedly then he handed
him a little vial of the lethal tablets
which would for a time at least per-
mit his distracted brain to forget
  usually he was able to dismiss his
patients from his mind after he had
done what he could for them and filed
their cards away he did not find it
so easy to forget slade
  for one thing he came upon articles
written by him from time to time in
the journals to which he subscribed
flis fellow practitioners mentioned him
occasionally slade was a sort of mys-
tery and it was admitted that he knew
more about embryology and chemistry
than they did themselves nobody could
tell just how much the fellow did know
whatever he said or wrote was uttered
with authority and was hard to refute
he had a laboratory which none of
them had ever seen and where it was
rumored that he carried on extraordi-
nary experiments the nature of which
was unknown
  nevertheless arbuthnot had very
nearly forgotten him when six months
after his call he received a brief note
requesting the alienist to visit him the
following afternoon upon a matter of
life and death
ii
  promptly upon the departure of his
last patient at a little after four next
day arbuthnot stepped into the taxicab
he had already summoned and fifteen
minutes later was admitted by john
slade himself to his quarters on the top
floor of a wholesale storage house well
downtown there was nobody about
except the janitor who took him up in a
rickety freight elevator and indicated
the door bearing slades card
  he had become much thinner more
haggard the physicians swiftly apprais-
ing glance told him as he took his dry
skinny hand in greeting the eyes
seemed to have retreated deep into their
the man who knew too much

bony sockets and were now magnified
by thick toric lenses the mans bare
feet were thrust into sandals and he
wore a light loosely belted linen robe
falling to his knees he took arbuth-
nots hat and indicated an easy chair
  the room was evidently slades gen-
eral living quarters it was large
square lighted on two sides by win-
dows its utter lack of the atmosphere
of the conventional bachelors den
struck arbuthnot at once there were
no hospitable glasses or tea-things nor
so much as a pipe rack or ash tray
the place was as ascetic as a monks
cell an effect heightened by slades
girdled robe and the sandals books-
ranks and columns of them-in built-in
cases along three sides of the wall a
great flat table with reading lamp and
precise stacks of papers a rack of
sharpened pencils an open volume with
fresh marginal annotations a wide
couch bed at one end its blankets neatly
folded filing cases at its head and
foot through a half-open door ar-
buthnot glimpsed the famous laboratory
-mostly a gleam of white enamel
against which glimmered the blue-green
of retorts and the glitter of polished
brass
  slade seated himself
  do you believe that suicide is ever
justifiable arbuthnot 
  the physician started
  certainly not
  slade laughed
  old inhibitions doctor first your
hippocratian oath - which was never
composed by hippocrates and is a
jumble of pompous platitudes then
your religion we mustnt take life-
because that power is the only one we
hold in common with god therefore
-god is jealous
  arbuthnot scanned the face before
him scored deeply with the lines of in-
somnia strangely illuminated with the
vast mental energy going on within
everything at top speed-he thought
without replying blood pressure too
high of course pulse rapid and wiry
-you could catch its flutter over the
hollow temples breathing short-and
stirring only the upper chest burn out
pretty fast at this rate   
  i told you what my trouble was
slade continued in his tired voice i
know too much and i know more now
than on that day when i consulted you
oh very much more
  still the alienist uttered no comment
let the poor devil talk it was a relief
-sort of safety-valve
  the fact is i know so much that i
am a menace to god almighty one
of us-so it seems to me-must go and
you sit there smugly and tell me that
suicide is wrong as one would tell a
naughty child not to bite its nails
slade closed his eyes for a moment
and inhaled a deep breath then he
pulled open a drawer in his table and
held out a little oblong glass slide
  bits of protoplasm arbuthnot life
cells and all the scientists in the world
with their most cunning microscopes
and reagents cannot isolate one of them
and say whether it would have devel-
oped into a rear-admiral or a cucumber
an elephant or a moth a theologian or
a toadstool am i right
  the physician half smiled
  with certain reservations you are
perfectly correct he admitted
  one step separates me from divin-
ity slade remarked i havent yet
actually created a life cell but i stand
on the threshold and then-what
many have stood on the threshold a
long time slade with the eggs of sea-
urchins and-
  grammar school stuff piffle i
tell you in less than a year probably
within three months i can from inor-
ganic substances form a living cell
then having the power of creating and
destroying life i shall emerge the lone

the man who knew too much
pioneer the first human being to rise
to godship and i dont dare i tell
you i am afraid what of i dont
know not of anything that can hap-
pen to this wreck of a body not of
any hell-and-damnation stuff not of
pure annihilation but i am horribly
afraid-of something so much so that
i am withholding my foot just as i lift
it to take that final step that divides men
and gods
  i think you are perfectly right ar-
buthnot assented in soothing tones id
feel the same way about it myself
slade stared at him for a moment
before his yellow face broke into a
myriad of little wrinkles and his voice
into cracked laughter
  youre only a little fellow in your
profession after all  you think im de-
mented-even now youre figuring on
how to keep me quiet till you can get a
message to the psychopathic hospital
the alienist went mottled-red it
was precisely what he was thinking-
but he was a man of great dignity and
hated to be mocked even by a lunatic
  youve no right to say that he par-
ried i simply agreed with you
well-even alienists know enough
not to contradict their patients dont
they you didnt dispute that chap
when he told you he had a glass heart 
humor us my learned friend humor
us
  instantly dropping his banter he
leaned forward his voice falling to a
whisper
  what would you say if i told you
that i could take any life cell and make
of it what i choose what are the de-
termining factors light-heat-mois-
ture-food-what we term in general
environment
  he touched a thick leather-bound
book on the table
  here are the formulas all worked
out what will you my good arbuth-
not an oak tree or a lizard a
pretty girl or a serpent-or if you like
both in one
  he rose jerkily and beckoned his
visitor to follow him into the other
room
  arbuthnot now thoroughly on his
guard against any sudden violence di-
rected by slade against either of them
followed him into a room twice as long
as the other and fitted up as a labora-
tory
  even in his anxiety the extraordi-
nary neatness and order of the room
caught his notice there was none of
the litter familiar to such places pre-
sided over by man with only vestigial
housekeeping instincts brass and nickel
were gleaming test tubes glass jars
stood in racks or on shelves rows of
labeled bottles were not sticky or stained
by escaping drops of their own con-
tents tables floor walls showed no
trace of dust or grime a tall three-
leaved screen cut off one end of the long
room which was lighted from a sky-
light it being too early to turn on any
of the numerous incandescents
  slade crossed over to where appar-
ently a huge steel safe was set in the
wall and opened the thick door it
swung easily and noiselessly upon its
oiled pinions revealing a closet the
height of a tall man with a perforated
disc upon the floor and a grill of shin-
ing rodsextending to the top over-
head was an oblong box thickly wound
with heavy copper wire a number of
dials indicators and gauges were at-
tached to a heavy plate screwed to the
inside of the door slade turned to the
silent physician
  this is my lethal chamber he ex-
plained one who enters this steel
chest and throws this switch ceases to
exist he disappears more scientifi-
cally since in our universe nothing can
be destroyed he is transmuted into ma-
terial not identifiable by our imperfect
senses simply open the door five
the man who knew too much

minutes after i enter and you will see
or rather you will not see
  arbuthnot made an involuntary step
toward the other who smiled and closed
the heavy door
  do not be alarmed i have other
things to show you
   he pointed out a few of the ingenious
contrivances in the laboratory calling
especial attention to his electric incin-
erator and showing his guest how by
turning a small lever a globular furnace
became white hot in a minute or two
anything placed therein would shrivel
almost instantly to ashes
  and now for the real exhibit he
said leading arbuthnot to the far end
of the room and around the screen
which he had noted on entering
ill
  late afternoon had set in and the
dusk revealed nothing but a long row of
square glass cases standing upon a
trestle and emanating a sickly greenish
light in the afterglow which slanted
down through the skylight
  slade switched on some incandes-
cents
   details leaped out at arbuthnot he
noted that some of the glass tanks con-
tained a fluid while others were dry
electric wirps were connected with each
and thermometers indicated their in-
terior heat faint stirrings-a little
scraping on the sand of one of the dry
containers-indicated some sort of life
within slade touched his sleeve and
directed him to the end of the row
   peering within the alienist made out
some creature which he could not iden-
tify nor even classify as plant or ani-
mal it swayed gently in the water its
eight or nine inches erect with a bulbous
head and a suggestion of human fea-
tures  but its limbs were like some un-
wholesome plant with twigs for hands
and feet it seemed rooted in a yellow-
ish-gray clay at the bottom of the tank
little bubbles rose continuously from its
mouth
  part man-part seaweed observed
slade what do you think of it
   arbuthnot bent closely over the stag-
nant water a feeling of horror crept
through his veins like iced water the
homunculus turned its head-if it was
a head-upward and its eyes whitish
and without cxpressioh seemed to look
through the viscous fluid into his own
a rudimentary nose-a wide mouth-
sessile ears-these he made out before
the thing seemed to take fright and
slithered down to burrow into the clay
in which its lower limbs were rooted
  without a comment arbuthnot per-
mitted himself to be led to the next tank
  here was unquestionably a minia-
ture woman beautiful and shapely as
a fairy with perfect breasts and an ex-
quisite little head swaying upon a slen-
der neck her skin  shimmered silvery-
green in the water arbuthnot turned
deathly sick as he saw that below the
waist she-it-was seemingly a slimy
eel
  concerning the occupants of the other
glass boxes he retained only a jangled
sense of hideous and unclassifiable mon-
strosities there were serpents that
were part vegetable plants that mocked
humanity there were other things that
fascinated by a sort of loathsome beauty
sickened to the soul he was dragged
back to a consciousness of the present
by the low-pitched voice of john slade
whose presence he had forgotten
  i dont suppose that i can possibly
explain my feelings toward these little
creatures we have no adjectives no
similes for it-because it isnt a human
emotion i am the first man ever to
know it there is nothing of sex in it
you see nothing comparable to love of
wife or parents or offspring it is the
yearning of the creator over the people
he has created god feels it i suppose

the man who knew too much
for tis but in depicting gods love we
grope for words and say that he cares
for us as a father for his son
  he moved from the blue-green tanks
with their faint stirrings of a nameless
life shadowing the translucent glass at
the end of the screen he turned to look
squarely back at arbuthnot
  although a narrow and unimagina-
tive man you are an honest one he
said you will know what to do i
am going back to nothingness
  the physician heard him cross the
room caught the soft click of the lever
as he threw open the great steel door
he leaped forward overturning the
screen and beheld slade with a quick
motion cast aside his single garment and
shuffle off his sandals his naked body
stood out for a second against the dark
interior of the metal closet and then
the door closed noiselessly behind him
  arbuthnots impulse to rush forward
and open the door was arrested by a
deep musical tone which came from the
closet slowly and by infinitesimal tonal
shadings it rose through the scale cul-
minating at length in an incredibly thin
and high note like the keenest harmonic
of a violin it died away into silence
but he had a feeling that the sound was
still mounting up and up though now
far beyond the range of his ear then
he turned steadily enough and switched
on the current in the electric incinerator
  the half-hour that followed was
never anything save a horrible night-
mare the details were not clear and
he made no effort to recall them on
many a sleepless night he prayed to be
able to forget them all
  when the furnace was white hot he
began dropping into it one by one the
living organisms from their glass tanks
as he moved back and forth there were
times when he felt that he was a malig-
nant deity destroying a world a sense
of megalomania like that induced by
certain drugs obsessed him the poor
creatures didnt want to die that was
plain enough they clung to their bleak
arid lives and they feared and hated
him when slade had approached their
tanks they had evinced a feeble pleasure
or at least a sluggish indifference but
from arbuthnot they shrank seeking to
hide away among the pebbles and sand
and fragments of coral and into his
mind came the words of scripture how
on the last day the human mites shall
call upon the mountains to cover
them
  the little tree-man fought with a
futile rage seeking to bite his fingers
and making no more impression upon
the skin than if it had been buffalo hide
its tiny twig-like fingers struggled
ceaselessly and it seemed to feel acute
pain as he uprooted it from its bed of
clay but the eel-woman offered no re-
sistance  and her tragic despair was the
harder to bear she covered her wee
breasts with her hands and tears unbe-
lievably minute rolled down her face
  down arbuthnots streams of perspi-
ration poured as one by one he dropped
slades creations hissing into the white-
hot incinerator when at length he had
done ending by burning the great book
filled with the formula which might con-
ceivably enable another to recreate a
forbidden microcosm his limbs were
trembling and his pulse racing
  ordinarily he would have dreaded to
open the steel door which slade had
closed behind him but after what he
had done anything else seemed com-
monplace his nerves refused to react
further listlessly and almost incuri-
ously he crossed the room turned the
lever and pulled open the door
  a wave of heated air swept out stir-
ring the damp hair upon his forehead
but there was no one inside
  the steel closet was shining and
empty
fit for a king
   by walter deffenbaugh
i
men who read books with
whom i have talked more
than a little in my spare
time are fond of quoting
shakespeare perhaps they quote
others but mine is a mind like presi-
dent wilsons-one poetic train is
enough on my single-track-and so i
cant remember the rest one quota-
tion sticks particularly in my mem-
ory
  it is something about there is a
tide in human affairs which taken at
its flood leads on to victory per-
haps that isnt quite right it has
been a long time since i have read it
because working up and down the
strait of juan de fuca and the
beaches of the north pacific one
cant carry much of a library
  but what made it stick with me
was that thing in it about the tide
you know the tide and the waves are
like a woman they cant keep any-
thing secret for very long just give
them time and they will tell all about
it a woman cant keep a secret-
neither can the sea
  that fellow knew what he was talk-
ing about when he wrote that but he
did not know it half so well as we
did because he did not know how
much we depend on the tide and the
surf for our tips on what the smug-
glers and other criminals are doing
along our uninhabited coasts if it
were not for the help of the sea we
would surely be lost
  it was a wave-a big one unwel-
  b m-dec-
come at the time unasked and rough
as waves usually are-that solved for
me one of the greatest mysteries our
service was ever called upon to run
down and one which had baffled our
best men for more than a year
  ill tell you about it
  do you remember james j plain-
field the man who made twenty or
thirty millions out of railway and
steamship lines in the west and died
a few years ago  you do i guess
everybody does i never met him
myself but at the time i am speak-
ing of it was part of my days work
to look up him and his past history
pretty thoroughly
  did you ever hear of a place he
built out here on the west coast to
entertain a king he called it the
aerie-eagles nest you know he
was that kind of a fellow-big and
rough and blustering but with a sort
of poets imagination it was that
which had brought him up from a
common sailor to what he was and
which gave him the idea when his
chance came to have a real king as a
guest to build this place up on the
rocks to take him to and stand with
him up there where he could take in
the whole pacific with one sweep of
his hand and say here king see
this ocean  well i control that
  hes dead now plainfield is but
the king isnt ive got two letters at
home from his royal highness-one
asking for full details of what i found
out about his friends house on the
cliff and the other thanking me for
my report i dont mind saying that

fit for a king

in the second one lie says that he feels
sure that if i had been on the job he
would have been perfectly safe
  of course that is more of a com-
pliment like some kings like to
make than anything else because
this king never saw the aerie he
got too busy with a war they were
having over in europe and had to
cancel his acceptance of jim plain-
fields invitation jim plainfield him-
self got pretty busy in that same war
in the shipping end of it and t guess
he and all the rest of the world would
have pretty nearly forgotten all
about the aerie if a newspaper-
man in seattle hadnt assembled a lot
of facts and strung them together in
a sensational story he called the
house of fatal mystery which was
copied all over the country
  that was the way i got in on it
the big chiefs in washington read it
and as it was in our territory we
got orders to look into the matter
and it surely did seem serious and
mysterious enough for somebody to
look into
  it seems that in six months no less
than four men who were last seen in
the neighborhood of the aerie had
disappeared off the face of the earth
more than that two women who
couldnt tell what had happened to
them or the missing men they had ac-
companied to the house on the cliff
had been found exhausted and more
than half crazy in the big woods that
the place on three sides surround
  it was a house of mystery all right
but as fine a structure as you ever
saw plainfield had given orders
that it was to be fit for a king-
and it was in more ways than one
  it was a sort of glorified log-cabin
something like what i understand
they call chalets or hunting lodges in
europe but i dont believe there is
one in europe like this house on the
cliff jim plainfield as i said had
been a common sailor but he had a
soul far above tar and ropes and can-
vas he had roamed the far seas and
seen a lot he had studied a lot
and when the riches came he kept
on traveling and seeing and reading
he loved the sea and his big yacht
the fir was a common sight on every
ocean
  it was in this way he met the king
i	never knew the exact details but i
believe he saved the kings life or
something like that during a yacht
club regatta at any rate their friend-
ship became common knowledge
and when the king planned a visit to
america it was common gossip that
he would be plainfields guest when
he reached the coast
  plainfield was always a very busy
man and depended for details a great
deal upon subordinates who had been
with him for years in most cases so
even in so important a matter as the
building of this house for a king he
only went as far as drawing the plans
and giving directions for the furnish-
ings the actual superintendence of
the thing we learned had been left
to a man named harry stanwood who
had been steward of the big yacht
valet to plainfield and generally his
man of affairs in minor business and
quite largely in social matters
  so while the boss planned the
house it was really stanwood who
built it and had it all ready with every
convenience to receive a king and it
was some job too out in that wilder-
ness materials had to be hauled for
miles and labor was very scarce
stanwood who was something of a
mechanic had to do a good deal of
the work himself but he had plenty
of time so it did not make a great
deal of difference
  he was a most interesting sort of
character we found out all about
fit for a king

him because in our investigation we
started out with plainfield himself
and gradually took in everybody who
had had anything to do with the
aerie naturally stanwood came
second because when the war came
on and it was found that the king
could not come and plainfield be-
came so busy with his shipping in-
terests he left stanwood in charge of
the house with permission to do as
he pleased-practically gave it to
him
  there used to be some gay old
times out there and harry stanwood
became well known in all the puget
sound country for his hospitality at
the expense of his boss it was war
time and everybody was more or less
on edge with war worry and specu-
lation and german spy scares and
one thing and another it seemed to
be a great relief to a lot of people to
go out to the aerie for a few days
and sort of rest up
  out there one could forget the war
plainfield himself was above sus-
picion  stanwood the financially re-
ceptive host of the place was past
fifty years of age apparently not de-
sired for war duty and by his own
statements of many years an english-
man-a statement borne out by his
speech manner and conversation
  besides that the state of washing-
ton had voted dry but the aerie
never seemed to have heard of the
law going into effect stanwood ran
no bar but the cellar stock was
checked against each paying guest
and the cellar itself in a sort of cave
under the cliff was one of the houses
principal points of interest it was
big enough to house a regiment-a
natural formation in the rock upon
which the house was built-and upon
those notable occasions when stan-
wood himself was host to his
own particular cronies he frequently
ordered supper served underground
where the wine and spirits were
handy
  not many people knew of the place
i have always doubted if plainfield
ever knew anything at all about what
went on there but among those who
did know the aerie was a cele-
brated rendezvous that was so un-
til this newspaper article with its
array of gruesome facts threw a dam-
per of dark mystery about the whole
region cut off stanwoods source of
revenue and probably hastened the
death of plainfield which occurred
within a few months and before the
mystery surrounding his chalet had
been solved
ii
  we were really first drawn into
the case in a sort of semi-official and
confidential capacity one of the
men who had disappeared there-
about was a former assistant to a
cabinet officer who still had many
friends in washington the circum-
stances were such that they did not
want to call in the regular peace offi-
cers of the state of washington
there was a matter of a little spree
and a woman or two involved we
were called in as much to avoid pub-
licity as anything else but we got in
good and deep-we and our old
friend the sea after we had watched
in vain for it to give up a body
  i wont mention this mans name
we succeeded in keeping the facts
quiet and avoiding scandal even after
we found his body its the way we
have in the service but you must
have read in the newspapers about
the others we found them and we
also checked up on the two women
found half crazy in the woods i dont
wonder that they were
  naturally we were first suspicious
of the people at the house itself

fit for a king
there is nothing particularly sus-
picious about four or five people
dying or disappearing in the course
of a few weeks or months in this big
world of ours but when they happen
to do so in the immediate vicinity of
an isolated place up on a cliff looking
out over the pacific and none of them
has any connection with one an-
other save through visiting this spot
something seems to be wrong it is
like there was a regular fog of sus-
picion clustering about the whole locality
and we plunged in first where the fog
was thickest
  but the trouble was to find the people
who were or had been connected with
the aerie stan wood was in charge
but it was easily found out that he spent
most of his time in seattle portland
vancouver or victoria indeed the
facts stood out like sore thumbs that
he had been particularly conspicuous
in one or another of these cities upon
the dates of the mysterious disappear-
ances that he had seemed greatly con-
cerned over them and had himself led
the searching parties that had recov-
ered the two women but had been un-
able to find any trace whatever of the
four men
  outside of him we could find no one
regularly connected with the place ex-
cept song chin a chinaman of the
usually mystical age of forty or eighty
or thereabout who so completely no-
sabbied everything except expert cook-
ing that we had to give him up and put
him in the same class with the rocks
and the trees and the ocean rather
considering the fact that sermons are
said to come from stones that the big
firs distinctly sing and that the waves
roar in anger when their long ocean trip
is ended at the coast song was dumbest
of them all
  there were a couple of young indians
who puttered about the place occasion-
ally cutting firewood and sometimes
acting as guides in the woods or han-
dling a few canoes and a motorboat that
were kept in a sheltered cove about half
a mile down the coast from the rocky
crest where the house stood but they
were no different from a couple of
hundred other young bucks along the
coast and indeed stanwood seemed to
have employed a lot of them rather in-
differently from time to time it was
true as he explained that a months pay
was enough to last one of them half a
year and they usually quit on pay day
  there was a garage but no chauffeur
or mechanic stanwood was fully quali-
fied to act in both of these capacities
and indeed that was one of the reasons
plainfield had put him in charge of the
house he was a whole crew of serv-
ants in himself during the time that
guests were on the cliff we found that
it had been the custom for them to bring
their own servants-a couple of japa-
nese boys or a maid sufficing for these
visits which were generally of a sort
in which the utmost privacy seemed
to be desirable
  so we were up against it so far as
the house staff was concerned and
forced to attack at the mysterious
house itself
ill
  it was a twelve-mile ride through a
huge forest of firs over a private road
to reach the place and outside of a few
scattered and tangled wood trails this
was the only way to reach the aerie
loggers had never penetrated that sec-
tion and the underbrush was too thick
to make the country attractive either
for hunters or for deer or bear them-
selves it was one of those places where
the forest remains just as god planted it
waiting its turn to serve its purpose in
the world
  from the sea as we finally saw it the
place seemed the most inaccessible spot
in the world standing high on a great
fit for a king

cliff the waves beat interminably on
jagged rocks that formed its base
always the spray seemed to dash half-
way up this great -foot pedestal up-
on which the house stood down below
was the little cove in which the canoes
and the motorboats were stored but
even these had been dragged to the spot
through the forest and the nearest really
safe havens for watercraft were fifty
miles south and in barclay sound be-
yond the strait of juan de fuca far to
the north
  it was heart-breaking work but it
had to be done we quartered and criss-
crossed that whole tangled section of
primeval forest we made trails through
parts of it that not even a pheasant had
ever seen so thick was it ahead of us
we drove indian guides and scandina-
vian axemen until they were reeling
with weariness wet with perspiration
and soaked with the eternal dampness
of these woods and nothing could we
find finally absolute exhaustion drove
us back to the aerie to rest up but
principally we went there to collect our
frazzled wits and think things over
  naturally we had made a complete
search of the house-or as complete as
we could stanwood had not been
there at the time he had pleaded im-
portant business in seattle and as we
had him constantly shadowed in the city
we were rather glad of his absence but
he came out while we were there the
second time and with him along with us
we went through the house again with a
fine-toothed comb to say nothing of
flashlights jimmies and other tools we
had said we were going to tear the whole
house apart itntil we had solved the
mystery but we didnt find anything
  the house itself was a beauty built
all on one floor with the exception of
an observatory on the roof to give
it a little touch of distinction i imagine
it was apparently hewn out of solid logs
from the little clearing behind it even
the floors were of solid slabs of cedar
and so was the woodwork with which
the interior was finished
  from the rear or the land side you
stepped into an entrance hall alongside
the kitchen and from there into a great
combined living- and dining-room that
took up the whole center of the house
to the right were four or five bed-
rooms and to the left the private suite
built for the personal use of the king
in front of this was a sort of sun-
parlor and study and a private
dining-room and along the side a huge
bedchamber with a massive bed in it
made out of native cedar
  most of the beds in the house were of
the usual brass variety but the royal
couch was a huge and most interesting
affair stanwood confided to us that he
had made it himself for plainfields
room but the boss had done him the
honor of selecting it for the king be-
cause it was such a fine example of
the craftmans skill it was indeed
we all had to take our hats off to
stanwood as a master at carpenter
work
  he had a marvelous set of wood-
working tools and he seemed to be more
worried about them than about anything
else as we searched the house ruining
the edge of one after another as we
tested floors and walls and sought to
pry up huge timbers with delicate
chisels we tapped and tested and
sawed and bored until the house was
pretty near a wreck and still we could
not find anything
  at last as the best boatman in the
party i volunteered to make a search
of the ocean front we had done it be-
fore from the motorboat keeping well
off the rocks and searching the face of
the cliff through binoculars but i
wanted to get in closer and finally per-
suaded an indian to go with me in a
canoe it was plain he did not want to
go i had to talk real rough to him but

fit for a king
he knew about the federal prison on
mcneil island and he recognized my
badge he figured that the sea was
safer than my anger and we started out
  it was a hair-raising trip although
we had selected the ebbing tide of a
fairly calm day for our exploration
even on the ebb the swells of the wide
pacific were torn into surf by great hid-
den rocks and dashed into foaming
spray as they were broken by the claws
of the cliff we could only edge in a
way then turn and paddle for our lives
-turn back and try it over again the
same way
  not much satisfaction in that sort of
work i soon decided but the sea has
always been my ally in duty along the
coast and i had a hunch it would help
us out in this baffling case and i was
playing that hunch strong just as we
edged in for the last time i saw some-
thing-a shadow it might have been
or a discoloration in the cliff  but at any
rate it was something-and dropped my
glasses to seize my paddle to swing in
closer but before i could dip we were
nearly capsized on a hidden rock and
only the caution of the indian whose
muscles had already been set for flight
saved us from death as the vision was
snatched from my eyes
iv
  when i got back the other fellows
listened politely enough but they were
too busy with another angle of the case
to take my fleeting vision very seriously
brierly and campbell were seated at the
big table in the living-room with the
notes and papers they had taken from
their pockets before them stanwood
was in his room and corrigan was keep-
ing watch on things outside as one of
us always did
  brierly was talking or rather think-
ing aloud as he reviewed the facts we
all knew and sought to find some hidden
meaning in them
  there was adams he said the
first one to drop out seattle ship-
builder supposed to be a millionaire
bachelor and privileged to have brought
this miss johnson here with him if he
wanted to i suppose no discoverable
reason for running away or committing
suicide no idiot would try to run away
from here on foot anyway
  the johnson girl knows nothing
about it or im a dutchman says he
went to the kings room to go to bed
she heard him scream and the room was
empty when she got there windows
all closed-no other door no one here
who could run the car and after two
days of it she went sort of off her head
and tried to get out on foot
  then come hunt and terwilliger
they were here together and alone ex-
cept for a jap valet and chauffeur no
one knows what door they went through
the jap says he liad gone to his room
over the garage after eating his supper
and that they were gone in the morning
certainly they left the car behind both
were good friends prosperous business
men happily married out here appar-
ently just for a little rest
  now we come to the bosss friend
what happened to him successful
lawyer fine record brilliant future no
troubles that we know of bit of a
rounder he was they say and i guess
its true if that kilmer girl came out
here with him tried to find him she
says after he vanished doesnt re-
member where she last saw him she
says but thinks it was some place inside
the house here now what became of
him
  what in hell became of any of
them campbell answered with a shrug
of his shoulders
  we were silent for several minutes
then brierly shifted his position sud-
denly and hurriedly relighted his pipe-
a sign that he had an idea or at least
thought he had
fit for a king

  what business was adams in he
demanded of us
  shipbuilding you idiot i an-
swered because he knew as well as i
did
  and what business were hunt and
terwilliger in was bis second ques-
tion
  airplane spruce-whats the idea
i grunted in reply
  and the bosss friend what was
his game  lawyer wasnt he but what
kind of clients did he have
  that set campbell and me to think-
ing who were his clients
  corporation lawyer wasnt he
brierly asked eagerly handled things
in a legal way for big firms gave ad-
vice to big manufacturers didnt he
  we agreed that he did
  was he attorney for adamss ship-
yard brierly went on fie was
heres his name on the letterhead as
one of the directors he was general
counsel for hunt and terwilligers lum-
ber company wasnt he you bet he
was and a stockholder in it too
  is it just a coincidence or is there
anything funny in the fact that all four
of these men were big figures in the
munition business out here
  campbell took his feet down from the
table rtnd t started scratching my-head
as this new angle soaked in they were
in the munition business-all four of
hem-but who-how-what connec-
tion was there between that fact
and their mysterious disappearances
neither campbell nor myself are partic-
ularly quick thinkers we sat silently
waiting for brierly to go on
  why did these men come out here 
he asked was this place advertised
for rent no very few people knew
anything about it and you know that
stanwood refused several pretty good
offers from people who did know but
whom he didnt want out here for some
reason or other some people asked
to come and were allowed to do so we
know who they were and know that they
paid well for the privilege they got
back all right and told some of their
friends about the place
  but how did these missing men get
out here tell me that
  i turned to campbell he had done
most of that end of the investigation
and i was not quite sure of this angle
of the case myself
  stanwood invited them he an-
swered
  sure of that asked brierly
positive he urged all four of them
to come why what the devil are
you driving at anyway
  for answer brierly leaped from his
chair and ran softly from the room over
to the bedroom wing of the house he
opened the door into the hall noiselessly
and disappeared for a moment
  its all right he reported as he re-
sumed his seat stanwoods in his
room reading
  what of it campbell wanted to
know
  just that weve got to make sure
that he stays there or some place else
where we can find him when we want
him was the reply go tell corrigan
to keep an extra eye open and then
hustle back here
  we smoked in silence until campbell
came back and brierly was ready with
a new line of questions he was a man
who thought a lot and let his thoughts
sort of simmer in his head until they
jelled then he was ready to talk and
when he talked it was to some purpose
who is stanwood  he demanded
englishman i answered sort of
upper-class servant has worked for
plainfield for years gambles drinks
and runs with women when the boss
isnt here
how do you know hes english
well i dont i admitted but hes
been accepted as english here and over

fit for a king
in canada for a long time talks about
england and all that sort of thing
humph grunted brierly re-
member that austrian chap we rounded
up after he blew up that ship in seattle
harbor last month what was his
name 
  good-looking well educated chap
i muttered why it was-stan-
stan- and i turned to campbell
who had made the arrest
  goshamighty stanwich campbell
exploded
  exactly said brierly with n air
of great satisfaction stanwich and
do you remember that our friend inside
there showed a particularly keen inter-
est in that case and that he was asking
about it only this morning 
  yes i nodded but what pos-
sible connection is there between that
and this case here
  just this said brierly slowly and
distinctly ive a lot more than a
hunch that our friend is no more
english than song chin that his name
is stanwich and not stanwood that
these two men are either brothers or
cousins and both on the same job
you mean- i asked
  i mean that the fellow in jail down
in seattle destroys munition ships and
the fellow in here destroys munition
makers and that they both work for the
same boss these four men were all
munition makers and stanwood either
murdered them or knows how they were
murdered
  it was a little too much for me and
i sat still thinking hard campbell
started up and made for the hall door
but brierly halted him
  what are you going to do he
called
  sweat it out of the devil he an-
swered
  brierly shook his head
  cant be done he said hes too
deep for that theres a trap in this
house some place and weve got to find
it then he turned to me what was
that again you thought you saw on the
side of the cliff
  i explained again and we waited for
brierly he was senior man and be-
sides had the clearest head in the
party and we readily agreed as he
outlined his plan
  campbell he said you and cor-
rigan go through the kings bedroom
again its the most likely place and
thats where the girl says adams dis-
appeared with a scream mac i hate
to ask yon to do it because i know how
dangerous it is but youre the best boat-
man and we ought to know what that
thing is you saw ill relieve corrigan
outside and think tilings over
v
  campbell and corrigan went at their
job at once but i had to wait for the
next ebb tide and before i left i made
sure that one man at least would be on
the edge of the cliff with a coil of rope
in case things went wrong i knew
there wasnt much chance for a capsized
man among those rocks but if i did hit
trouble a rope was the only possible
chance for my life
  i couldnt find an indian anywhere
about the place i think they had an
idea  might want to go out there again
and so i had to go alone in a lighter
canoe the sea was a little smoother
than before or rather a little less rough
you couldnt call it smooth at all i
crept in closer and closer while camp-
bell watched from the top of the cliff
i didnt dare use the glasses because
the paddle took both hands but i found
the spot i had seen and kept my eyes on
it plainer and plainer it grew as i
edged toward it and i let out a whoop of
satisfaction as i saw a narrow opening
in the rock
i waved an arm at campbell and
i
he saw his chance and before ive could stop him leaped through
the window-page 

fit for a king
turned my head to make sure of the
back track through the surf when i
saw a big comber almost on top of me
i dont know where it came from they
happen that way sometimes but it was
coming all right and i would have said
my prayers if i had had time it caught
the little canoe like a barrel at the crest
of niagara and in a huge surge of
water and blinding spray i dashed
straight at the cliff
  i didnt guide the canoe god or
somebody else did that but the next
thing i knew i flew between jagged
rocks that scraped the sides of the
canoe and then with a sickening lurch
and a flop i slid into quiet water twi-
light and then darkness i had hit the
fissure in the rocks and was inside a
huge cave
  two or three minutes later i had
managed to pull myself together enough
to look about i was shivering more
from the shock of being alive than any-
thing else but i managed to find
matches and scrambled out into the shal-
low tide pool i couldnt see any roof
about me but i threw pebbles as high as
i could without striking anything and
when i shouted i decided from the
sound that it must be mighty high i
had slid in about fifty feet and lighting
one match after another i felt my way
back into the darkness to see what was
there
  only a few steps had i taken when i
came to a wall which i could see was a
sort of a shelf about twenty feet high
and climbed it there on the rocky
floor was the solution of our mystery
if not the key to it
  four bodies four dead men twisted
and broken as they fell to their death
from far above adams hunt terwil-
liger and the bosss friend i had not a
doubt but i did not stop to make sure
my last match was in my fingers and
i had some job ahead if i were not to
join them
  scrambling down the wall i splashed
toward the sunlight at the mouth of the
cave where the surf still boiled about
the jagged rocks to swim through i
was impossible my only chance was
to find a pinnacle i could climb and trust
to campbell and his rope fortunately
there was one a few feet out of the
opening and watching for a calmer
moment i leaped and caught it in my
arms and clung there drenched and
lacerated but above the pull of the re-
ceding waves
  finally i managed to squirm around
so i could look up and saw campbell
and corrigan flat on their stomachs
leaning over the edge of the cliff and
waving to me in a minute the rope
was lowered with a loop on the end of
it and into this i thrust my arms
they hauled me up with a few more
bruises and cuts but i was alive and
the rest didnt matter much
  breathlessly i told brierly what i
had found and gave him the approxi-
mate measurements and directions of
the cave quickly he paced it off and
where do you think we located the
spot above the pile of bodies the
bed in the kings chamber
vi
  we didnt waste any more time then
but went for stanwood he knew that
something unusual was going on and
was nervously pacing up and down the
big living-room campbell and corri-
gan grabbed him and we hustled him in
beside the bed he had told us he had
built
  stanwich brierly snarled and the
man winced at the name you are
standing directly above the bodies of
four men you murdered how did you
do it and why
  the words shook the man to his mar-
row but he still kept part of his nerve
he denied the charge denied his name
fit for a king
denied everything but as i described
what i had seen he broke still further
in a sort of superstitious terror which
i couldnt understand for a time
brierly was an adept at the game and
as he picked up an axe and attacked the
bed the fellow leaped back with a
squeal of alarm
  so thats it eh  said brierly with a
grin come now show us how it was
done and save a lot of trouble
  he gave up at that and showed the
devils trap hidden in the head of the
bed was a spring which when he pressed
it released another spring in the side of
the couch just where a mans knee
would rest when he climbed into bed
securing a pole he pressed this spring
from a safe distance and swiftly the bed
tilted at a sharp angle while a black
hole opened in the floor for an instant
and then closed again into its perfect
jointures
  the scheme he explained as he grew
calmer was to set the spring at the
head of the bed only when the trap was
to receive a victim at other times the
room was perfectly safe he might
have set it for us but did not believe we
could ever prove anything- against him
and also feared that the fall of one of
us would reveal his secret to the others
  his terror at my story he explained
was due to the news that the bodies were
still under the house he had found the
chimney opening into the cave when he
came there to build the house and the
trap was a culmination of the discovery
but he could hear the waves washing

down below and believed that the bodies
that fell through it would be washed
away with the next tide then if diey
were ever found it would be supposed
that they had tumbled from the cliff
  but why did you kill these men
brierly demanded
i didnt kill them he answered
they fell while i was not here
true but you set the trap and then
invited them here why did you do it 
he was silent for a moment then set
his jaws and straightened his shoulders
  they were enemies of my country
he said they were making munitions
to destroy my brothers why should i
not destroy them
  but this house was built before the
war brierly insisted why did you
build this infernal trap
  because he answered slowly mr
plainfield ordered this house built to
entertain a king i do not believe in
kings they are the enemies of man-
kind he ordered a house fit for a
king i made it so
  we drew back startled at the hate
that gleamed in his eyes and at the cruel
cunning of the radical bared before us
he saw his chance and before we could
stop him leaped through the window
another instant and he had thrown him-
self over the cliff to the rocks and surf
below
  there isnt much else to tell we
never found out who he really was no
i	havent said what king it was who

the new mystery books
continued from page a
matic situations that follow each other
hot-footed are too improbable to be
taken seriously bad as was the
perils of pauline it was yet a mas-
terpiece compared with this story i
cant even recommend this novel as a
suitable christmas present for a miserly
uncle
iv
  listers great adventure by har-
old bindloss-a story that starts with
an elopement in canada and ends with
a treasure hunt on the west african
coast of course the hero must find
the treasure in order to win the girl
lost treasure stories are always in-
triguing and this is no exception there
is plenty of excitement and the hero
has enough daring courage to equip a
dozen men which makes you take a
grain of salt at the end of every chapter
v
  the cross-cut by courtney ryley
cooper-again we have the easterner
going west to take charge of a silver
mine in the wilds of colorado the
usual villain the usual struggle to gain
possession of the mine the usual sus-
picion of crime hovering over the hero
and the usual obstacles to overcome
not a thing in this whole story that is
the least bit original
vi
  the unlighted house by james
hay jr-in this detective story we
have something more to claim our at-
tention than the usual murder mystery
a united states senator loses from his
overcoat pocket some valuable state
papers of course there is a murder
connected with the missing papers and
a sherlock holmes detective who finally
solves the mystery not a bad yam
but still not new or clever enough to
make me want to throw my hat in the
air with enthusiasm
vii
  the three eyes by maurice le-
blanc-a powerful mystery story that
is as good as anything the creator of
arsene lupin has written it deals
with the unique and terrifying discov-
ery of an aged inventor and its disas-
trous consequences to those having
knowledge of its secret the plot is
rather fresh and novel and there is a
delightful love story a good book to
read
viii
  devil stories an anthology edited
by maximilian j rudwin-to me one
of the most interesting anthologies yet
published if you are at all thrilled by
the supernatural and have a secret de-
sire to know something about that most
mysterious of personalities the prince
of darkness here are enough yarns to
tickle your fancy the editor has se-
lected twenty well-written stories all of
which have the devil as their central
character fascinating reading and
well worth your time a book that
would not be out of place in your
library	-  
ix
  the house of night by leslie
howard gordon-this is a hectic tale
of the mexican-arizona border one
of the craftiest officers of the famous
villa kidnaps the beautiful daughter of
a rich rancher of course he docs not
reckon with the fearless hero who
loves her deeply theres the plot
and what happens takes up the whole
of the novel enough guerilla warfare
to break the dull monotony of a win-
ters evening

any phonograph can play brunswick records
a brunszvick achievement vouched
for by highest musical authorities
musicians critics teachers all will tell you the severe
test of a phonograph is in rendering high notes espe-
cially soprano
remember this when buying a phonograph and insist
that soprano records he played
note then how most instruments vibrate sound
metallic when the higher notes are reached
then hear the same records oil the brunswick
hear the full range of high notes soprano high
c in ringing intensity without slightest metallic
intrusion-clear-toned vibration less and you will
marvel at difference so great in phonographs
exclusive methods the reason
by means of exclusive methods of reproduction and
of interpretation brunswick achieves perfect rendition
of the so-called difficult tones-the piano the harp
the human voice methods which apply to no other
phonographs or records
the brunswick method of reproduction is exclusively
brunswick the brunswick method of interpretation
in producing records has not been successfully imitated
hence buying any phonograph without al least
hearing the brunswick is a mistake and lo be with-
out brunswick records is to be without what is best
in music
ask vour nearest brunswick dealer for a demonstra-
tion the brunswick plays all records and brunswick
records can be played on any phonograph hear com-
pare--then judge for yourself

 packs a wallop
granpop probably is
the national champion
at swapping things
        
two years ago he swapped
the old blind mare
        
for a cider mill
        
and then of course
when we went dry
      	 
cider mills got valuable
      	 
and granpop swapped again
and got a flivver
        
so i said granpop
        
suppose i start you
        
with that old busted
baby carriage back home
couldnt you swap it
and get me
a limousine
a crafty gleam
         
came into granpops eye
as he said no
        
but ill tell ye
ill swap a match
for one of them
cigarettes of yourn
that satisfy
       	 
so we swapped
one broken paper match
for one perfect cigarette
and you ought to see
how pleased he was
it did me good
       	 
to be done by granpop
swap some change for some chester-
fields your good money never brought
better value choicest tobaccos turkish
and domestic so blended that you get every
last bit of their flavor and chesterfields
do what no other cigarette can do for you
-they satisfy
