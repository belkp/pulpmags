these canyons of the night a man and girl came each for a different reason to find that their destinies lay in bringing light to this land together chapter i enemy country between high blood- red canyon walls the trail ran snakily cross- ing and recrossing a noisy little creek along the road two chunky gray horses were pulling a cov- ered studebaker wagon with a tarp patched in variegated shades stretched over its bows driving was a gray- mustached pleasant-faced rancher puff- ing contentedly on a pipe following the wagon came six loose saddle horses hazed along by a pretty dark-eyed girl sitting a blood-bay gel- ding with a careless thistle-like grace dressed in gray breeches woolen shirt a flat-crowned sombrero she looked to be a youngster of fifteen or sixteen but jean carvel was past eighteen as the wagon and the horses passed through the sun and shadow of the canyon she began whistling a gay somewhat in- tricate tune which her father the driv- er had often played on what their rancher neighbors called a fiddle--in reality an expensive violin in the wagon dan carvel nodding in time with the whistled music sud- denly hauled back on the reins mak- ing a sharp turn about a cliff shaped like a boat's prow the team had run  into half a dozen horsemen drawn up in a line a battle line plainly for four of the riders held rifles above their saddle horns the group as soon as the wag- on had stopped began to move on past the gray team in the lead was a big beefy-faced middle-aged man dressed in dandified style--a cream-white wide- brimmed hat red and black checkered shirt black leather chaps with huge silver conchas where you think you're headin fellow this man addressed carvel harshly i don't see any keep out signs posted along this road said the driver quietly my name is dan carvel i'm here on legitimate business i ranch over in the piedras country to the east a year ago i bought five horses that were raised in this night canyons country a while ago they all headed back for their home range i paid good money for them and i've come to get them if you've got no objections he added with mild sarcasm we got plenty objections growled the beefy rider i'm george threllen manager of the cross seven ranch and i never sold you any horses it's a ten to one bet if you bought any night can- yons horses they were stolen from us that bein the case you got no claim to em turn your outfit and hightail it out of here the girl's father eyed the six riders and the mild look left his face to be   robert dale denver replaced by one of stubborn determin- ation that sounds like an order threllen carvel stated and i don't work for you or the cross seven fur- thermore all this night river country except the little used for ranch head- quarters is government land--never has been homesteaded it's still public do- main and as a citizen i've got the right to travel over it on my business i've got a bill of sale from the garys in dawn canyon for those horses with proper descriptions and brands and those brands weren't cross seven and they had not been blotted after i find my stray horses you can look them over to see if you've got any claim or title to them threllen's big face turned redder his almost colorless eyes began to glow a bunch of thieves all the garys he stormed the whole tribe of em and their neighbors--thieves and worse killers murderers i'm giving you one last chance git outa here or else or else what inquired carvel un- perturbed but his calm had just the opposite of a quieting effect on threl- len the rider's big hand fell to the six-shooter in his holster but as the ugly snout of the gun came up jean carvel spurred past the wagon to push the blood-bay in between her father and threllen at this threllen's horse shied starting his rider to swearing and spurring then as the rowelling made the horse sheep jump threllen holstered his six-shooter to use both hands to jerk the animal's mouth sav- agely sitting her blood bay meanwhile jean carvel her dark eyes luminous angrily surveyed the group of them all of them in unconscious compli- ment to the girl's looks straightened a little in their saddles one horse- faced man black bearded as a biblical character with greasy black hair curl- ing from under a torn sombrero grinned in a loose-lipped way and slyly began edging his horse closer to the girl's she was talking to her father dad do what they say she urged you have no chance against six armed men turn the team around let's go back dan carvel shook his head no jean i'm going on the girl's gray- mustached father was one of those quiet men whose anger can equal in intensity the loud-mouthed rage represented by threllen's blustering sort i know i've got no chance against them he ad- mitted all i've got is a shotgun in the wagon loaded with birdshot but a man has a right to travel over govern- ment land on his own business and i'm not turning back they won't touch you jean if they harm me you ride back and notify the sheriff he spoke to the team and the wagon rolled on through the riders for a few yards it was allowed to proceed then the cross seven manager threl- len barked an order two men at once spurred after the grays to lean down and seize their bits again the outfit halted threllen still yanking vicious- ly on the bloodied mouth of his horse came up on the off side of the wagon opposite jean carvel shooting has been what we handed people passing through here after we warned em to keep out he snarled at carvel but we'd hate to shoot down a father in front of his own girl so we'll make it a quirtin for you--as a special favor grab him some of you and truss him up against that pine maybe losing a little hide will teach him we mean what we say yank him down for a few moments under the blood- red cliff walls there was a struggle-- a desperate but hopeless one pushing past jean carvel two men had dis- mounted to climb over a wheel plan- ning to drag her father from his seat behind them the girl took down her lariat intending to drop a loop over the pair stop that she-cat hake yelled threllen and the man with the curly black beard came in to snatch away the rope then dropping the lariat he caught the girl's wrists in his hands canyons of the night  meanwhile dan carvel had landed one hard blow on the jaw of the lank cowboy reaching for him promptly the cowboy fell back over the wheel hit- ting the ground hard two other cow- boys however seized carvel and des- pite his savage fighting brought him to the ground here they tore off his shirt and undershirt and a few moments later dan carvel's body bare above the waist was plastered against the rough reddish bark of a pine then his arms were bent around the trunk and the wrists lashed together with a length of thong leather after that at a word from threllen the lank cowboy that carvel had hit in the jaw went to get a quirt from his saddle jean carvel her wrists in the vise of the big hands of the man threllen had called hake tried vainly to break loose while her blood-bay danced nerv- ously hake chuckled and grasping both her wrists in one big wide paw he put the freed arm around the girl drawing her slim body close to him you ain't no she-cat you're just a little pigeon that's what you are he murmured cutest little pigeon i ever laid eyes on don't you dare hit him jean carvel screamed as she struggled fu- riously to get loose the girl was be- side herself with horror and anger looking for some way to free herself she glanced down at hake's knee cov- ered only by a pair of levis bringing up one leg agilely she jammed the spur wheel against the man's leg a loud squall of pain came from hake and his grip on the girl's hands slackened jean jerked them loose and reached for hake's six-shooter riding in a holster at his waist the big hog- leg came out of leather but threllen was coming in on her left crashing his horse deliberately into the girl's blood- bay jean clung desperately to the six- shooter but before she could use the weapon threllen had clamped her arms to her sides next instant he twisted the gun roughly from her hand the weapon fell to the ground and with it went the girl's slim chance of helping her father hake had captured her wrists again and was twisting them cruelly jean began crying not because of the pain but in pity for her father let him have it quinn yelled threllen to the man with the quirt and we ought to give his wild-cat daughter a dose of the same medicine the man lifted the quirt high over dan carvel's bare back but before the blow could fall a clatter of hoofs sounded and another rider came out of the trees down canyon a young wom- an riding side saddle and dressed in an impractical garb for range country --a long green riding habit topped by a sombrero as a concession doubtless to the strong southwestern sun she was blonde tall slender--too slender for vigorous health the face too thin for beauty her eyes a deep blue in color were dull dead with a definite look of haunting melancholy she rode straight to the tree to which dan carvel was bound i asked you to wait down canyon for us miss linda said threllen what are you doing here the girl returned what has this man done threllen who is he you can see for yourself what we're doin threllen told her sullenly we never saw him before him and his daughter say they want to hunt some stray horses they claim they bought from the garys most likely horses the garys stole from us if there was any horses like he claims it's my idea he's a gary spy we can't allow no stranger in here on our range you know that mr temple has given orders to stop anyone coming in on the ranch if this man had intended any harm the girl pointed out he wouldn't risk bringing in his own daughter since there's no other wagon road to dawn canyon he's entitled to travel through our range to the gary ranch to get back his horses give him a reasonable time to find them and take them out i don't understand why you have to count everyone as our enemies you and tem-  robert dale denver ple take it for granted that anyone coming into this country comes to do us harm and we got a right to take that for granted burst out threllen we didn't start what's been started in here one of the garys and a neighbor killed your father didn't they and they've killed five of our cross seven men haven't they it's us against the garys and the rest of those ranchers in dawn and star canyons they've been steal- in our horses and now that they've started shootin us down we got to fight back i'm having this man whipped so him and other men will learn to keep off our range his voice had an almost fanatical earnestness i say to turn him loose said the girl sharply lashing a man for just crossing our range is beastly and in- human turn him loose threllen evidently was having trou- ble in reaching a decision a powerful man physically with a huge store of vitality he plainly was a slow thinker the other men patiently waited for his orders except for the black-bearded man hake they appeared to take little interest in the affair it was just an- other job to them having to make up his mind seemed to enrage threllen almost to the point of bursting his dark-colored face turned purple he muttered to him- self then all right turn him loose he ordered finally but listen to me you he snarled at carvel's back you can go on to the garys the road to dawn canyon turns up a side canyon to the right up there a ways we'll give you three days to get back through here and we'll look over any horses you take out turn the girl loose hake freed carvel silently replaced his torn clothing then he addressed threllen if you had had me whipped he declared i'd have killed you some time for it he would have said more but jean carvel dismounted to lay a hand on her father's arm to urge him toward the wagon and don't you turn a foot off that road to dawn canyon said threllen as a final word don't hunt for horses on this range if you brought em from the garys they wouldn't of come back here that turnin off don't apply to you little pigeon the black-bearded hake told jean carvel his little pig-like eyes gleaming you can turn off any time you want to just so you turn my way at this carvel swung angrily on hake but the girl on the black horse spoke up hake she remarked in a voice that was suddenly like a whip- lash keep a decent tongue in your head the carvel wagon creaked on again with the loose horses trailing after it jean carvel rode over close to the girl in the riding habit thank god you stopped them she said in a low voice i'll never forget that never the rider of the black horse was at least three or four years older than jean she looked at jean gravely now as at a child and then she smiled sad- ly i'm only sorry it happened she said adios as the outfit went on with the wag- on wheels jolting hard over stones the girl on the black horse looked after the slim graceful figure of jean carvel in her blue eyes with the tragic cast was plain envy silently the whole group of cross seven riders watched until wag- on and horses were out of sight lafe hake with his loose-lipped smile keep- ing his small eyes fixed on the girl on the blood-bay then threllen frowned at the sun which was low enough to send a path of rays over the pines making a comb along the ridge gettin late he mut- tered yes agreed the woman on the black i wish i could trade places with that girl threllen she seems really happy without a worry she's of the sun while all of us that live here in these night river canyons are of the shadow and there is nothing ahead for us but shadows canyons of the night  threllen looked somberly at his horse's ears we'll have the shadows cleared up fore long miss linda he said gravely and then we'll have plenty sun--all the sun there is for ourselves we're due for a big ruckus but when it's ended we'll have those garys wiped out and we'll have all the canyons of the night to ourselves he spoke with the heavy conviction of a person who had few ideas but had those few firmly fixed the woman shivered let's go back she said abruptly and the group went along the canyon at a jog trot two men riding a hundred yards in front threllen with miss linda and three men in the back as they rode the men kept rifles over their saddle horns ready for instant use chapter ii night ambush oldish andy partle who was roane bran- don's partner on a small cattle ranch was frequently heard to declare that his young partner had been born a few dec- ades too late roane andy maintained should have lived in the days when he could have trapped the rockies in the company of kit car- son jim bridger and their kind roane liked hunting and catching wild mus- tangs more than he did ranching the business of ranching often bored him and at such times he would load a pack horse whistle to a half-dozen hounds and ride back into isolated country to hunt and trap a few weeks or months later looking as wild as a wolf he would reappear ready for another stint of ranch work two inches over six feet loose rangy with a deep good-humored voice roane brandon in a buckskin quill-ornamented jacket made a strik- ing figure lounging now against the bar of the coulter saloon in the town of hurley after a trip of a hundred miles from their home he and andy partle a gray-mustached man of sixty had ridden into hurley that morning with two pack horses having made camp on the outskirts of the place and hobbled their horses they had spent the hours since loafing about the town standing with them now in the coul- ter bar and gambling place was fred temple president of the big cross seven ranch company temple was a transplanted easterner a city man dressed in a business suit with english riding boots a long-headed reddish- blond man of forty-five who would have looked entirely in place at a bank direc- tors meeting andy and roane had practically forced their company on the rancher temple being the snobbish sort who did not readily pick up ac- quaintance with strangers andy and roane were drinking beer sparingly temple was drinking scotch--a lot of it--and warming up a little under its influence the two had been lucky in having found temple in town that day but that was as far as their luck went they had come to the hurley country to make a deal with temple for cross seven horses but temple had declared curtly that he had no horses for sale the cross seven is not selling horses i tell you snapped temple when andy partle brought up the mat- ter for the third time they would need gathering and we haven't time to do that just now we have more impor- tant matters to attend to we'll do the gathering offered partle and we'd pay mighty good money for a hundred head or so that we got a chance to turn a profit on we'll give you a hundred a piece for three-to five-year-old mares and gel- dings that's mighty good money good money admitted temple startled and you can make money paying that much for unbroken horses yeah stated roane brandon  robert dale denver these night canyon horses are some of the best in the west and they've got looks besides we know a bunch of easterners that will pay big money for horses to stock the ranch they just bought we'll pay you a thousand dol- lars down now as earnest money the rest when we tally out the hundred head for the first time temple considered the deal the ranch could use that money he said those horses do us no good out there just running on the range you say you can gather them yourself they're hard to corral in those canyons i know that country mr temple said andy partle like i told you i rode for the cross seven some years ago that's our offer--a hundred a piece for a hundred head totaling ten thou- sand dollars partle and brandon glancing at tem- ple knew that the man was seriously turning over their offer there was a money look in his light blue eyes you've got the thousand dollars earnest money in cash he asked andy partle promptly pulled out a roll of bills but another man had strolled up to the bar stepping in be- tween temple and the other two partle recognized the proprietor of the saloon and gambling place gid coulter andy had noticed him before standing talk- ing to a customer doing some solitary heavy drinking at a nearby table the customer seemed vaguely familiar to andy but he had not been able to place him hello coulter said andy still doing business at the old stand i see many a dollar of hard-earned wages i lost in here a long time ago when i worked for the cross seven nobody asked you to lose your money in here coulter rasped the saloon man was tall and raw-boned with a battered hook-nosed face seems to me i heard you talking about selling some horses temple probably i heard wrong it's mighty easy money coulter said temple ten thousand dollars for a hundred head--that's the offer we got so many horses out there running wild that they're eating the range poor i wouldn't sell no horses now tem- ple growled coulter not with these other things to attend to step back in the office and we'll talk it over coulter's voice was uncompromising and harsh it was the wrong tone to use on temple who had had too many drinks of scotch what's there to talk over he re- turned arrogantly i'm president of the cross seven and capable i trust of running its affairs we need money what's a better way to get it than to sell horses i'll take your offer he told andy partle and roane brandon hand over that money and i'll give you a receipt it would be businesslike i guess to have a sales agreement besides a re- ceipt said roane brandon and taking a pencil and sheet of paper from a pock- et he began writing on the bar top now look here temple put in coulter i say we'll talk this over first you're drunk and don't know what you're doing temple who was a plain snob when sober and worse when drunk turned on the saloon man my dear coulter he said sarcastically will you kindly con- cern yourself with your own business all right growled coulter abrupt- ly and his greenish eyes held a glare that boded no good for temple have it your own way he retreated to his office staying there while the deal for the horses was completed the sales agreement signed and the thousand dol- lars paid over during that interval the hard-drink- ing customer at the table had gotten up to stroll into coulter's private office closing the door behind him temple tucked the money in his pocket and promptly left the saloon brandon and partle were about to fol- low when gid coulter emerged from his office and strode toward them canyons of the night  you men probably think you've made a good deal he remarked try- ing hard to appear friendly but there's a war on in those canyons of the night you'll get shot if you go in --by one side or the other the garys and the mcwhirters and the neils got two of the seven canyons on the east side of the river and the cross seven has the other five they been fightin to see who gets them all the prin- cipal owner of the cross seven addi- roane brandon son stevens was killed in a gun battle not long ago this city dude temple who's running the ranch has no more business managin a horse ranch than i got ramroddin a sunday-school if i were you i'd keep out of that fight temple and his punchers can't protect you from the garys and their neigh- bors the garys used to be decent folks when i worked here before remarked andy tough now are they tough you bet they're tough i wouldn't ride through those canyons now for all the horses in the west five of the cross seven men been killed besides addison stevens you take a lot of interest in our health said roane coolly i'd like to ask why coulter stared at brandon hard you could ask he rasped out and i'd tell you that it's none of your damned busi- ness except that it happens i don't want you or anybody else in that coun- try is that plain the saloon man had raised his voice suddenly so that his words could be heard over the entire room roane and partle quickly glanced about them the gambling establishment in the coulter saloon occupied over half of the big room a half-dozen dealers were on duty lounging about their tables and layouts since the saloon was practically empty these dealers partle and bran- don noticed were suddenly alert all were armed with six-shooters the faro lookout was holding an ugly-looking shotgun over his knees roane realized this coulter saloon and gambling place could be a tough place he himself was not armed he never went armed into a town he went armed in wildernesses where he might run into a grizzly on the rampage andy partle wore an old bisley mod- el six-shooter stuck behind his belt andy moved now so that he faced both the dealers and coulter with his hand just above the handmade cedar handles of the gun i wouldn't start anything coulter said andy i'm old but i can still plug a dollar in the belly at thirty paces my friend's got no gun but he don't need one that young'un without a shootin iron is more danger- ous than you are with one coulter with his bare hands he could tear you apart you and any two men you got in here and what he can't tear apart i'll shore shoot apart for a moment coulter stared at andy partle's bisley then he looked at roane brandon in his garb that was reminis- cent of the old fur trapper days mean- while the dealers in the place looked at their employer for some signal abrupt- ly coulter shrugged his shoulders if you want to go in and buy horses off the cross seven all right he stat- ed it's no funeral of mine turn- ing he strolled back into his office coulter had backed down but when partle and brandon left they kept a  robert dale denver wary eye on the coulter dealers out- side the pair looked at the little town built on a slope of the monster canyon cut by the night river upstream in an enormous bend of the river were the seven so-called canyons of the night dusk in which the cross seven head- quarters lay and four sister canyons comprising the cross seven range-- dark twilight moon and midnight closer explained andy partle were the two canyons dawn and star in which were the ranches of the garys the neils and the mcwhirters nothin to keep us from travelin into them canyons now--ceptin our good sense remarked andy and the two headed for their camp a big flop-eared hound came out to greet roane leaping up on him and giv- ing one deep bark roane patted the black and tan hide of the animal called savvy because he was a smart dog with lots of savvy bringing in their hobbled horses they packed up and prepared to travel although the sun was already swinging low over the rims i don't like this trip andy partle grumbled as he tightened a pack saddle cinch that gambler wasn't tellin us no fairy story about how dangerous it is down there with a war on between the cross seven outfit and their neigh- bors in dawn and star canyons they's allus a lot o tough cowboys ridin them canyons nobody would ever work that rough country ceptin outlaws on the dodge is that why you took a job there asked roane slyly yes it was the other man admitted frankly i had to go on the dodge for a few years until the trouble i was in cleared up best horses i ever seen down there but them canyons is just good places for funerals a thousand feet straight down in some places them canyons had me spooked then and they still got me spooked i'm tell- in you i got a feelin we'll never get back out of there roane brandon chuckled you ought to get yourself a gypsy outfit and tell fortunes for a dollar a throw bet- ter buy yourself a quart of liquid cour- age before you leave town it'd take a bar'l to help me andy said whimsically as he slapped the sad- dle on his horse the kind o shivers i got now would take more'n whiskey to warm up nossir i didn't like this from the time that nab woman sent me a thousand dollars cash to hand fred temple as down money in a deal to buy horses i couldn't see no sense to hand- in out a thousand dollars for nothin what was to keep me from just waltz- in in i thought but that woman was right she wrote that any other way it wouldn't be safe strangers found in them night canyons are shot on sight with gun- hands jist hired to exterminate garys and neils i cain't believe it--when i worked on the ranch addison stevens was plumb friendly with the garys but he's dead now and this here temple is in charge a different breed andy's jaw suddenly fell and he stopped his work now i know that fattish feller that sat at the table he exclaimed hamlin stevens addison's half-brother he used to be a slim sort owned some stock in the ranch and used to come there to live and hunt in between traveling to europe and back drinkin'est feller i ever heard of two quarts a day was nothin to him when he was goin good but he was quiet on his drunks--not no hell raiser not like you then remarked roane jokingly come on get that horse loaded you can chatter later they set out jogging along with jouncing pack boxes and with the hound savvy sniffing at trails but fol- lowing none knowing this was not a day to hunt but after the hound had scared two young grouse whirring into a pine roane shot them grouse would make a good supper reaching the rim of a deep canyon andy halted moon canyon he said next one to it is dusk where the cross seven headquarters is located canyons of the night  might as well camp here it's gittin late i used to stop here often years ago when i was ridin for the cross seven roane hobbled their horses while andy cooked supper the return to the country where he had ridden years be- fore had put the oldish partle in a sen- timental and reminiscent mood it's sorta like one of these romances you read about in books confessed andy as they ate this here margaret mcnab woman--we called her nab-- she looks rough as an alligator but un- derneath she's got a soft heart and a big one she was on the ranch as nurse to that motherless little girl linda ste- vens when i was ridin there that little girl couldn't a had a better moth- er that nab was a mighty fine nurse too--she saved my life one time i had pneumonia that's when i fell for her --hard why didn't you marry her de- manded roane i'd of done it in a second the only reason why i didn't is nab wouldn't have me then said she was going to stick to this little girl linda stevens --that linda bein without a mother needed her more'n i did so when i left the ranch i told her nab if you ever need a wuthless roughneck to per- form some triflin service let me know and she promised me she would but i never heard nothing more all these years until i got that letter from her she said the stevens girl had been sent back east to school a few years back and nab had gone to the coast to nurse in some hospital now she was back on the ranch again sort of as com- panion for linda stevens who was all grown up she said that linda's pa had been killed in a gunfight and if i was still willin to give that help i offered once to let her know but that it might mean a risk to my life so i wrote her back i'd come and that's when she sent the thousand cash so i c'd get on the cross seven disguised as a horse buyer that's all right but i hadn't no call to get you into it you didn't get me into it dis- agreed roane i begged for the chance to come along and anyway i owe you something i haven't forgotten how you took me in after dad died andy spat tobacco juice you don't owe me nothin for that you could of raised yourself from the time you was a five-year-old weaner livin by hunt- in and trappin nobody had to take you in jean carvel all right said roane good-humor- edly there's no debt on either side and i just came along for a chance to look at these night river horses and see some new country and to see this nab lady fall into your arms savvy busy with part of a grouse carcass suddenly began a low growling andy scolded the hound let him growl said roane sav- vy's hearing something and warning us against it and by his growl it's no coyote smelling our grub it's some- thing more serious savvy smells a man  cordin to you that hound kin talk andy hoorawed his partner that brute'll get you into trouble some day he'll tackle a bear and then run back to git behind you for pro- tection not savvy returned roane i'm going to douse the fire and when i do  robert dale denver you jump back into the brush and don't waste any time jumpin that's a man savvy's smellin back there leaning forward he swiftly spilled a canvas bucket of water over the small flame as steam and smoke arose he and andy leaped back into the dark- ness seconds later came the crash of a rifle sounding from the direction of a rocky point behind camp a second shot came a moment later roane grab- bing a rifle from his bedroll shouted to savvy go git him boy when the hound with a deep bark streaked toward the little rocky hill roane was close at the dog's heels there were no other shots but as the hound's voice lifted again in a booming bark up ahead came the quick drum of horse hoofs and the crash of a horse through the brush savvy pursued hot- ly as the fleeing rider kept to the dense cover of pinion and cedar racing away from the camp roane realized the man would put a bullet into the hound if savvy got too close and taking a whis- tle from a pocket he sent a shrill blast to recall the dog from his hopeless chase before he returned to camp roane found the boot tracks of the ambusher not many yards from the camp using several matches he photographed their shape in his mind and took measure- ments with a piece of string andy had built up the fire again and was stomping about angrily when roane returned the blasted killer he growled all set to take a potshot at us likely sneakin up to git close range shots at us when you put out that fire lucky that hound smelled him out yeah agreed roane searching about in his bedroll and bringing out a pair of indian moccasins which he be- gan exchanging for his high-heeled rid- ing boots that bird came from the direction of hurley he was sent out likely by someone there i'd mention your old friend coulter if it wouldn't hurt your feelings i'd like to hurt coulter with a hot sixgun slug grunted andy if twas him that sent that buzzard after us you sure ain't goin chasin a feller at night in this country afoot he pro- tested watching roane put on the moc- casins it's goin to storm and in the dark there's cliffs where if you fell off you'd land about in time for breakfast --only it'd be some buzzard's break- fast not yours roane swiftly laced the moccasins i got a pair of night eyes and i'll take savvy along on a leash to guide me i've got to go afoot if i rode a horse that fellow would hear me coming a mile away goin afoot after a man on a horse exclaimed andy and then abruptly shut up he knew that roane was a buck- aroo who had ridden bad outlaw horses and as a mountain cowboy had roped bulls on treacherous slopes andy also knew that in hunting roane and his pack of hounds had run innumerable bear and lion in country too rough to ride a horse over and had done it for hours at a stretch roane could travel all day at a trot most lion and bear hunters can they usually have to in following their hounds on a hot trail standing by the campfire in his buck- skin jacket roane looked like an in- dian except that his features were too square and his eyes were blue he put a knife in a scabbard at his waist wrapped a little bread jerky and coffee into a package and dropped a dozen rifle cartridges into a pocket i feel like taking a little run he remarked if i don't come back tonight you move the outfit on tomorrow to the cross seven headquarters i'll join you there if savvy was a little bigger you could put a saddle on his back and ride him said andy but i hate to see you go roane it's risky following a bushwhacker like that in rough coun- try he may lay for you or he may travel fifty miles fore he stops roane shrugged and picked up the carbine i won't kick at going fifty miles after that hombre i aim to find canyons of the night  out who would sneak up on us to am- bush us want to ask him why he did it better put a bullet in him first and ask him later cautioned andy partle they play marbles for keeps in this night river country and they use lead slugs for marbles chapter iii two good samaritans savvy had no trouble in picking up the trail of the horse of the would-be dry gulcher the rider had head- ed down into moon canyon on the trail roane and andy had followed from town savvy trot- ted down it sniffing occasionally tug- ging on his leash but not very hard whining a little in a bored way savvy wasn't too keen to be on this trail there was nothing exciting about fol- lowing a tame horse it was just a job chasing a rabbit would have been more fun and sport the canyon bottom was wide fairly level and clear of trees off under the peaks a storm was brewing but here the moon was out to show a wagon road the rider was following this road and after him trotted savvy mile after mile with roane jogging along tirelessly in his moccasins out of this canyon the road angled finally to climb through a long pass in a ridge then crossing a wide mesa it dropped into another canyon from andy's description roane knew that this would be dusk canyon in which lay the cross seven headquarters he rested a minute or so listening to the night noise of the wind through the pines on the slopes lulled by it as if by music from a great organ then again man and dog went on the road forked one branch climbing into a side can- yon the horse tracks were plain in the moonlight turning up the side canyon roane turned with them several times he thought he could catch the sound of a horse's steel shoes up ahead it did not surprise roane that he should be overtaking the horseman ordinarily men did not ride fast at night in can- yon country--a jog at best--and roane had trotted almost steadily since he had left andy he increased his pace a lit- tle clouds were beginning to drift across the moon and stars and the road angled back and forth along a dark wooded slope roane was a hundred yards or more from what he judged was the canyon rim when he heard the crash of a gun a six-shooter above him two or three seconds and there was another shot then a third roane halted listening hard whoever was doing the shooting was certainly not firing at him after a little period of silence came the sound of a horse running away tearing through brush with a clatter of flop- ping empty stirrups plainly the horse was riderless savvy growled but roane silenced him another horse was in motion now going across the mesa with the regular hoofbeats of a lope roane began climb- ing again following the road at a trot with savvy padding ahead of him the moon was blanketed by clouds a few stars gave a little light the most plausible explanation for the shots was that the man he and savvy had been trailing had met an- other rider and there had been a short fight between the two one man had been knocked from his saddle and his horse had run off without him the other not waiting to make sure wheth- er he had killed his man or not had loped away on the rim roane hesitated for a moment from the thick darkness of a clump of cedars and pinions came the sound of a human voice raised in what seemed a faint call for help he moved toward it warily for as andy had said this was dangerous country savvy growled a little he stopped to tie the dog to a tree after that he catfooted along car- bine in his hand moccasins pressing  robert dale denver down softly until he was certain there were no sticks to crack under them there was no further call but he heard several groans someone had been shot but an injured man if still alive can be as dangerous to someone wanting to help him as to an enemy pushing aside a growth of small pines roane looked out on a little open space the light was just sufficient to show the dark blot of a man lying on his back roane moved in quietly to kneel by the fellow's side first making sure that the fellow had no gun the wounded man's hands were empty and drawn up under his right shoulder roane struck a match cupped it the man was a long sandy-haired cowboy somewhere in his early twenties his eyes were closed another match in a swift examination showed that his pair of high-heeled boots were much small- er than those worn by the man who had ambushed roane and andy this cow- boy was a victim of that ambusher which warmed roane to him at once building a little fire out of dry twigs he took away the clenched hands and found blood soaking the flannel shirt just below the shoulder cutting away part of the shirt revealed a hole made by a bullet which had smashed through the man's right side high up leaving a gaping wound from which blood flowed freely to staunch the flow roane divided his neckerchief to make two wads fastening them with strips of cloth torn from the man's shirt hearing the murmur of a creek not far away he brought a hat full of water to pour some down the throat of the man who had begun to whisper faintly water--still without opening his eyes there was not much help roane could give a doctor was needed here they were roane knew somewhere on the big mesa above the cross seven headquarters in dusk canyon he could go down the trail and along the canyon bottom until he came to the ranch but that would be a long time to leave the young fellow maybe too long in cutting away the blood-soaked shirt he'd heard paper crinkle in a pocket examining the paper now he found it was a letter addressed to one tom gary if this were one of the garys deadly enemies of the cross seven that did away with his idea of going to the cross seven for help there would be no help there for a gary looking about him he suddenly saw a faint glimmer of light through the pines to the north climbing a little hill he could see the mounting flames of a fire a fire started recently since he had not seen it before it offered a prospect of help and he started off on a trot near the campfire which was burning low by the time he came near it he saw the gray tarp of a covered wagon he raised a hail it was not answered but as he went close to the wagon a voice sounded from behind him--a fem- inine voice drop that rifle the voice ordered him firmly then put up your hands and march toward that fire and don't try any tricks yes ma'am no ma'am he said meekly and letting his carbine fall went along with his hands up he grinned a little he liked that voice despite the attempt of its owner to make it sound very harsh and forceful reaching the fire he calmly used a moccasined foot to kick up the fire then turned to look at his captor she was a girl of sixteen at most he judged garbed in a blue skirt leather jacket high-heeled boots her hair brown with luminous lights caught from the fire was fluffed above a dark-eyed face that was the prettiest roane had ever seen a mighty cute kid despite the double- barreled shotgun she held in a business- like manner sorry to disturb you miss he said but i ran onto a man who's been shot and is in a bad way he's lying close to the place where this road drops through the rimrock i'd like to bring him here to be taken care of laying canyons of the night  out in the open he won't have much chance to pull through i heard the shots said the girl that's why i built up the fire i was figuring to go over and investigate but you found him you say is he-- she hesitated i'm worried about my father he rode off today and hasn't come back yet that isn't the direction he went but-- her voice broke off it can't be your father roane as- sured her hastily a young fellow one of the garys at any rate he car- ried a letter in his pocket addressed to tom gary i'm a stranger in this coun- try but the man that shot him i'm positive is the same hombre that fired at my partner and me in our camp above moon canyon to- night the shotgun lowered a little then only to be brought sharply up again how do i know you're telling the truth she demanded why would i tell you anything else he returned simply the only way i can prove it is to show you that young fel- low right now you'll just have to take my word that i'm not a liar i know you're not lying said the girl quickly and as if to show she was ashamed of having doubted him she at once leaned the gun against a wagon wheel can you bring him here on a horse only way to get him here i guess although i hate to run the risk of all that jolting if there was another man we could carry him on a stretcher are you alone here she nodded yes we're strangers in here too we were traveling to see the garys about some horses that strayed back to this country and we came to a stretch of road that we in the second march number the road to grayhorse the story of a lost range empire by frank c robertson couldn't get the wagon across dad said he'd ride on alone and leave me in camp he'd have taken me along but it's dangerous riding through this coun- try and he intended to be gone only a day but why don't we make a stretcher for this man i can carry my end of it roane looked at her wiry body i guess you could he admitted this young gary is tall but not so heavy i'll cut a couple of poles if you'll get a piece of tarp by the fire they worked fastening a strip of stout canvas to two tough poles roane had cut then with roane car- rying the makeshift stretcher and a can- teen of water they started out walking fast over the rough ground he had left savvy tied near the wounded man and the hound gave a deep bark as they came near surprising- ly roane found young gary con- scious and even able to talk a lit- tle he stared up at roane and asked who are you someone that's willing to help you mister my name is roane bran- don i ranch over in the cradle river country and this girl's father rode to see you garys about some stray horses he hasn't come back yet maybe you met him he bought some horses from some of your family some time ago his name is dan carvel put in the girl you haven't seen him no said the wounded man but i left the ranch early today your horses came back my brother ed said they were the ones he'd sold roane held the canteen to gary's lips and gary swallowed a little you know what man you met up here asked roane the fellow that shot you  robert dale denver gary hesitated a moment then shook his head wouldn't tell us i reckon if you did said roane want to look after your own wolf skinning we'll have to get a doctor for you nearest one i suppose is in hurley no none there my uncle will gary is a doctor the best in night river country lives over on a ranch near dad's in dawn canyon i'll be able to ride back in a couple hours if i can get a horse i wish you'd get word to--to-- another gusty sigh came then weak from the strain of talking he fainted the blood flow from the wound had dwindled but plainly a ride even a short one would start it again they placed gary on the stretcher and started out walking slowly so as to jar him as little as possible thun- der was rumbling from a cloud bank to the northwest roane led the way enabled by his freakish eyes to avoid brush and boulders despite the dark- ness made by the approaching storm the girl tired but she was game re- fusing to stop longer than a few sec- onds to rest reaching the camp they placed gary in a comfortable bed jean carvel made in the wagon for him there roane undressed the man meanwhile the girl had prepared bandages and together they washed the dirt from about the ugly wound as best they could without disturbing the blood clots the bleed- ing had practically stopped but a high fever had begun to burn the man's body in delirium he began to mumble a few words jean carvel glanced up at roane in astonishment why he's saying the name of that girl from the cross seven the one who saved dad from being quirted by those brutes yesterday linda stevens he wants word gotten to her but i thought the stevens and gary families are enemies they are said roane i heard in town that addison stevens was found with a gary and a neighbor all dead of bullets this cowboy may be a friend of the stevens girl but i've got a hunch he has to be kept hidden from the cross seven bunch that his life won't be worth much if they find him we could take him on in the wag- on toward the garys if the road wasn't washed out but you wouldn't be here if it hadn't been washed out i don't know what to do with him it's going to rain which will wipe out our tracks carrying him over here but i doubt if it's safe to leave him in the wagon likely a cross seven rider shot him and that fellow may ride up here in the morning to see what happened to the man he potted she nodded agreement the wagon is off the road but it can be easily seen and if anybody comes into camp they could hear gary moaning but what can we do i can borrow a horse from you to ride for his doctor uncle to attend to him maybe he'll say it's safe to move him home meanwhile he can be hid- den in that rocky ridge back of here with a shelter rigged up against the rain but i don't like to leave you here alone in this ornery country you bet- ter ride with me to the garys your dad is likely there by now go away and leave gary by him- self jean carvel shook her head i couldn't do that and dad might come back here and find me gone not that i wouldn't like to be out of here i've been scared ever since i came down into these deep canyons and i'll stay scared until we get out if dad doesn't come back and he isn't at the garys i'll have to hunt for him tomorrow a few drops of rain hissed into the fire roane looked at his watch it was still an hour before midnight by morning enough rain would have fal- len to cover the tracks they had made carrying gary to camp taking a lantern and axe he set off into the low rocky ridge a hundred yards away he found a semi-cave made by a huge boulder that had fallen against a cliff no horseman could canyons of the night  reach the spot without dismounting no man afoot could see it without a close search a few poles and a tarpaulin would make a snug shelter against wind and rain after he had the shelter pre- pared he brought up dan carvel's bed- roll and a jug of water placing the blankets on a bed made of pine needles he stretched the tarp for a door after that he and jean carvel put gary on a stretcher again and trans- ferred him to the shelter she was to stay with the wounded man during the night she could as roane pointed out go to and from the wagon along a rocky path without leaving tracks--although the rain now slogging down steadily would take care of that back in the camp roane saddled one of the camp horses lengthening the stirrups on jean's saddle the wagon road leading to the gary ranches in dawn canyon would be difficult to fol- low in the rain but he was used to traveling strange country at night i think tom gary is in love with linda stevens jean said as they drank coffee from a fresh pot she had prepared he keeps saying her name if it came to the worst she'd help him maybe she's not in love with him said roane and she might turn him over to her relatives instead no said jean carvel firmly she's not that kind i saw her she seemed to be so unhappy herself that she'd hate to make anyone else unhappy she's sick--i don't mean with a disease just sick inside unhappy and i think that she's unhappy because she and this gary are in love and their families are fighting roane grinned just like a girl to think that he remarked you've been reading a lot of romances no use to fill your mind with that stuff now time for that later yes she scoffed how old do you think i am anyway he looked at her suddenly and frowned older i guess-than i thought at first he admitted but i don't imagine you're married are you no she said and chuckled of course not not for a long time yet fine he said and laughed also i'm in no hurry to get married my- self always figured thirty would be about the right age for me if i could find a girl to have me by then maybe you'd consider waiting that long i thought i'd wait until i was at least thirty-five she told him better yet he said approvingly that would let me put off marrying until i'm about forty it's a deal when you're thirty-five i'll be waiting then he sobered abruptly i hate to leave you here you won't get scared i'll be back as soon as i can i'd leave my dog savvy but if anyone saw him here it would be a dead give-away that i'd been in your camp i think i'll send him back to my partner with a note for him to move on to the cross seven that i won't be back i've trained savvy to go back to the last camp a smart dog takes after his own- er no doubt jean added slyly i'll get you some paper to write that note on and some oil cloth to wrap it in so it will stay dry drinking his coffee roane brandon looked with appreciative eyes at the girl as she climbed briskly into the wagon a lot of chance any man would have to marry that girl if he waited he reflected she'd have dozens of chances to marry the only way to get her would be to sweep her off her feet and rush her to a preacher quick chapter iv death at the wagon the storm as it moved over the canyons brought with it frequent flashes of lightning aided by them roane traveled steadily along the road to the across a rolling pine- covered mesa to drop into another of the seven sister canyons of the night river climbing out of this the road  robert dale denver wound along a narrow ridge where the cliffs fell almost sheer on one side to descend into a deep gorge that he judged belonged to dawn canyon home of the garys and neighbor ranch- ers andy had mentioned a narrow precipitous-walled rock gorge called gary gorge by then the storm had rumbled away leaving wispy clouds which allowed enough light for travel at a lope the clattering of the horse raising an up- roar that filled the canyon ahead finally he saw the first sign of habitation a light closer he could make out the dim outlines of building and corrals huddled on a bench a little back from the steep-walled trench through which he rode this must be a ranch of one of the gary families and if the garys were as quick to shoot as the cross seven riders it might be a ticklish matter to ride up to the place roane found however that riding up to the ranch was not simple he was halted suddenly by an obstruction a ten-foot fence of poles and wire stretched between the cliff walls there was no gate that he could discover half a dozen dogs had started a furious barking above him he raised his voice in a hail that was drowned out by the animals after repeated shouts he was answered by a mellow hello which floated from some point below the house you garys he shouted i want to come up and talk to you i've got word for you come up but come alone came the reply you can get through on the left we'll open up for you the dogs were called off and a small section of the fence next to the cliff lifted leaving a space wide enough for a horse and rider to pass through some mechanical device roane guess- ed operated by a rope or wire from a distance after he had ridden through the gate dropped again with an ominous clatter he was still in a rocky trough some thirty feet deep what do you want and who are you demanded the mellow voice com- ing from the top of the cliff i've brought news of a young fellow named tom gary and i've come to ask about a man named carvel myself i'm a stranger here--roane brandon i came to this country to buy horses all right leave your horse and walk on up to the house you'll find a foot trail a little to your left he found it a series of steep steps and dismounting climbed to it to fol- low a path toward the lighted house as he approached the building a door opened and a man appeared and in- vited him to enter inside he found himself in a comfortable well furnished ranch house the rancher was a tall oldish fellow long-faced with a bushy mustache the shade of bright wheat straw and mild blue eyes two men had followed roane up the path and now came into the house they were young fellows resembling tom gary either his younger brothers or cousins roane guessed you have news of tom you said remarked the older man yes he met some rider tonight on the rim of dusk canyon not far from the cross seven got shot roane said briefly i heard the shooting and found him lying there with a hole drilled in him--just below his shoulder we put him in a shelter off the road and looked after him as well as we could the older man shook his head shot is he i'm his father--clayton gary these are his brothers ed and lee the four of us batch here together where did you say he was roane detailed the location more fully and explained how he had found the wounded man and with the help of jean carvel got him to shelter and he told also that dan carvel had headed the previous day for the gary ranch to hunt for his stray horses carvel never arrived said clayton gary i'm afraid that what happened to tom may have happened to him those cross seven gunmen that tem- ple and threllen have hired shoot on canyons of the night  sight anyone not belonging to their out- fit but i can't understand what tom was doing over on the cross seven to- night he knew how dangerous it was to travel over there but come in the kitchen we'll have some coffee ed you ride up and bring down your uncle he's my brother and a doctor he ex- plained to roane in the kitchen lee gary made fresh coffee warmed meat and biscuits roane ate and told of the deal to buy horses from fred temple omitting however any mention that the thousand dollars earnest money had been furnished by margaret mcnab living at the cross seven i can't understand what got into tom to go over in the cross seven neighborhood clayton gary remarked again did he say why he rode over there he was out of his head roane replied evasively he surmised that tom gary had been riding to the cross seven to see linda stevens but it was only a guess and tom gary's private business besides what's all this fighting over he asked gary's face turned bleak god knows i don't i can't understand what happened to addison stevens who ran the cross seven until his health broke and his cousin fred temple came in addison was always friendly and cooperated with us--we garys our neighbors the neils and mcwhirters we were all developing in these can- yons of the night what we think is the finest strain of western cow horse-- rock and mountain horses it was addi- son's idea to cross morgans with steel- dust strains to develop a cow horse that had a world of bottom and spirit but wouldn't go crazy when roping like thoroughbreds do i've seen some horses out of this country stated roane they were good ones we've got hundreds of them enough to make us all rich if we'd gather them and break them all of us got along in here fine until addison stevens suffered a breakdown in health and the cross seven went downhill addison practically owned the ranch except for a little stock owned by his half-brother hamlin he borrowed money from jim coulter the hurley saloonman-gambler and sold an inter- est in the ranch to his cousin fred temple who's one of these polo-play- ing sportsmen that think they know all about horses linda stevens shortly after that addison stevens seemed to go plumb out of his head accused us of wanting to kill him claimed that some of us had taken pot shots at him we couldn't make him believe otherwise and then one day we found addison with my nephew lane gary and one of the neil boys--all three shot dead evidently in a terrible gunfight since then there's been open war between us and the cross seven clayton gary got up and poured him- self another cup of coffee no telling where it will stop and tom shot to- night he shook his head they've gone crazy that's what he went on the whole stevens fam- ily a streak of insanity runs through the whole outfit addison's half-brother hamlin has showed it all his life al- ways was an excessive drinker my brother had to treat him after the big  robert dale denver sprees he used to go on if hamlin hadn't been born in a wealthy family he'd have been put in an asylum long ago lately fred temple and his wife have said that they feared linda addi- son's daughter would go insane some- time that she was already showing signs of it they've brought out a nurse from the coast to look after her i'd say that we're living next to an insane asylum one that has money to hire gun- men fred temple is keeping up the feud asked roane keeping it up more than that he's had his manager george threllen hire a bunch of gun-slingers as riders tem- ple is an ambitious sort i think he wants this whole country and its horses for himself and is trying to drive us out the cross seven claims we've shot five of their men that's a plain lie seems to me remarked roane all this is something for a sheriff to stop gary snorted the sheriff that gambler coulter is strong enough in politics to keep the sheriff on the side of the cross seven someone rode up to the house and ed who had gone after his uncle came in uncle will is up at the sam neils he reported they've ridden to fetch him but it'll be an hour or two before he gets here roane got to his feet i'd better be riding back then without waiting for you he told clayton gary that carvel girl is alone over there you can come with your brother we'll look after tom until you come i've told you where to find the wagon i'd send one of the boys with you offered gary but the fewer of us in that country the better brother will and i will get there as soon as we can and the boys will make a search from this end for carvel roane nodded back through the fence closing the gorge he shoved his horse hard the first gray light of dawn was sifting into the canyons when he climbed finally to the mesa where he had left jean carvel he used the last strength in the horse spurring hard over the mesa turning off the road at last to head for the wagon he smelled the smoke of the fire be- fore he saw the wagon cover through the trees nearer he saw someone across the campfire--not one person but two one was the girl her back against a high wagon wheel holding a quirt back to roane was a tall puncher feinting to get in past the whip the man's laughter came to roane as he rode an evil sort that sent a flood of primitive rage into roane he rode straight in yelling in his savage rage forgetting the carbine in a saddle scab- bard the garys had lent him the man who was a black-bearded rangy giant swung instantly seeing the rider he dropped a hand to draw the six-shooter from his belt holster behind him jean carvel flashed in to catch the man's forearm--an act that maybe saved roane from being dumped from the saddle as he continued to ride in possessed with a crazy desire to deal bare-handed with the black- bearded brute roaring with anger the man--who was the hake that had held jean cap- tive at the attack on dan carvel--shook off the girl's grip he was too late however to fire the six-shooter roane had thrown himself from his saddle catapulting himself at the stranger as one would bulldog a steer his hun- dred eighty pounds hit hake full tilt sent the man to the ground with roane on top hake's six-shooter exploded harm- lessly just before it flew from his hand to fall close to the wagon tongue for a second both lay still a little dazed by the fall roane was the first to get up but he had only reached his knees when hake leaped at him like a cougar bearing him to the ground again this time with roane underneath roane twisted himself away and rolling out of reach got to his feet hake was up like a rubber ball also to dive for the fallen six-shooter too late jean carvel who had stood petri- canyons of the night  gid coulter fied rushed forward to try to kick it out of his reach hake had it and with a wolfish growl swung it about just as roane diving some six feet through the air struck hake with his shoulder hake crashed down but this time he held the gun he could not use it however roane clamping hake's fore- arm bent it back until he yelped with pain the man held to the weapon like grim death and roane lowered his hold to hake's wrist and gun barrel slowly he put pressure on the wrist while hake twisted and fought furiously to free his hand there ensued a grim silent struggle between the pair for the weapon with the younger roane proving to have the superior strength using the leverage of his long arms he succeeded in turning the barrel toward hake's side quit he ordered or you'll shoot yourself damn you the man grunted and again tried savagely to wrench the gun away the weapon was so fixed that the hammer fired without the trigger being pulled and the hammer had lifted during the struggle the gun exploded suddenly sending a shot tunneling up- ward into hake's chest shattering his heart the man shuddered and then straightened out to lie inert every muscle relaxed roane got up breathing hard hold- ing the six-shooter staring down at the dead man as he stood he swayed a little and jean carvel thinking he was about to collapse put her arm about him i'm all right he told her except that i killed a man i hoped i never would have to do that he killed himself disagreed the girl i'm witness to that you asked him to quit but he wouldn't and that's the man who shot tom gary last night his name is hake he works for the cross seven roane looked at the man's boots they would leave tracks about the size of those left by the man who had am- bushed him and andy partle in camp after shooting gary last night the girl went on he was afraid to risk finishing him in the dark he went to the ranch and came back this morn- ing to find out what had become of gary while hunting him he came into camp here he caught me and began kissing me i broke loose then he came at me again-- i'm not sorry i killed him inter- rupted roane grimly it was a plumb pleasure i'd like to do it over again him putting his hands on you i-- his arm went about the girl you're the bravest girl i ever knew jean to think that this--this--but let's forget him i reached the garys all right but your dad hadn't shown up there tom's father and his uncle doctor will be here soon and if there's no word of your father by that time i'll look for him with the help of my hound how's gary been she looked in the direction of the shelter containing the wounded man he's worse a lot worse i'll have to go back to look after him supposing i spell you out while you cook a breakfast here there's some- thing else i've got to do too he nodded at hake's body bury him and his saddle and turn his horse loose hoping it won't go back to the cross seven headquarters the horse is only  robert dale denver a half-broke bronc and the chances are he'll head for the range where he was foaled if he goes back to the ranch they might backtrack him here unless the rain starts again which it's going to do--those clouds mean business i hate to bury a man without benefit of coroner and preacher but it's the only way to make gary safe and ourselves she nooded go ahead i can testify later how he ended we'll never get out of here ourselves unless we're as hard as men like hake she brought two shovels from the wagon i'll help you she added practically no he vetoed that you've seen too much already for a girl you get busy on breakfast in an hour roane had a grave dug and filled and hidden under the pine needles rain had started to fall again a slashing downpour he had looked in on tom gary every few minutes the boy was in a bad way no doubt about it he ate a hurried breakfast with jean they had just finished when someone called from the brush not far from the wagon back in the trees roane found clayton gary and his doctor brother will roane took them at once to the shelter where the doctor made a care- ful examination of his nephew chapter v fugitive hunt the doctor-rancher will gary took his nephew's pulse and temperature shook his head tom can't be moved far he declared flatly i can clean out that wound and give him enough opiate to put him to sleep but he'd never live halfway to dawn can- yon if we tried to move him now by horseback the jarring would reopen that hole and he'd bleed to death the best we could do is to take him over part way by stretcher and the rest of the way in a rig at night but i couldn't recommend even that for a couple of days but if we leave him here argued clayton gary he's in danger of being tracked down and shot by these cross seven hounds i don't think he'll be tracked down after these rains stated roane they may not even know anyone was shot last night the man who shot him hake came back here this morning to hunt for tom it's just possible hake might not have told anyone of the fight and hake sure won't tell any- one now briefly he told the garys of his encounter with hake dr gary nodded it's at least safer to leave tom here than to try to move him on a horse leaving him in enemy country is bad enough but it gives him a chance at least taking him away now means he'd have none if he's got to stay he'll have to stay said clayton gary resignedly i'll be here with him of course you tell me how to take care of him i'd stay myself if i could said the doctor but with mrs sam neil expecting a baby i've got to go back and i couldn't do tom much good by staying here keep his fever down give him little to eat--that's all we can do i'll clean out this wound and we'll hope that he dodges blood poisoning and pneumonia then i'll be starting back and plan to get here again tonight to see him hastily dr gary worked with the patient after which he rode away tak- ing a little used trail to return to dawn canyon jean carvel who had stationed her- self on a little rocky pinnacle near the wagon to keep watch hurried to the shelter to give warning that a group of riders a dozen or so had come up the road leading from the bottom of dusk canyon threllen the cross seven manager was leading them this brought a fresh complication roane went back with the girl to the pinnacle through the rain they saw that all the riders except two were canyons of the night  spreading out through the timber near the head of the side canyon evidently to make a search so hake had told the cross seven that he had shot some- one and threllen had brought men to hunt the wounded man two of the party had caught sight of the wagon cover evidently for they were coming through the trees toward the carvel camp jean identi- fied one of these as threllen the other roane recognized as fred temple keep cool roane told the girl there's been enough rain to cover the tracks of hake's horse to your wagon tell them you haven't seen him but maybe heard a horse off in the brush this morning and you heard no shots last night roane hid in a dense thicket of brush close to the wagon judging it best that he be not seen in the carvel camp threllen and temple pulled up near the wagon to find jean washing breakfast dishes--only one set your father where is he de- manded threllen harshly i gave him orders to travel straight on to the garys the road was so bad that we couldn't take the wagon along it re- turned the girl spiritedly dad left by horseback yesterday to go to the garys he was to come back last night but he didn't fred temple whose pale blue eyes had been admiring jean carvel's pretty face and slim person pushed himself into the talk so you're the girl who came in here hunting stray horses he said with a gallant sweep of his hat and your father rode to the garys and hasn't returned it's easy to guess what's become of him in that case too easy he went on with a show of deep regret he ran into some of these gary killers and they shot him just as they shot my cousin and five of our riders my name is temple i run the cross seven may i offer you my sympathy and protection and may i suggest that you come to the cross seven to stay with us until we have definite word of your father mean- while i'll do what we can to find your father i'm afraid however he added with a shake of his head that i can't offer too much hope there seemed but one thing to say to temple's offer jean had to thank the man although she realized what lay behind his pretended solicitude temple plainly was a lady-killer jean had known a few of his sort george threllen we were told that one of the garys rode over here last night and was shot by one of our men temple went on there must have been a shooting scrape not far from here-- near enough for you to have heard the shots i'm a sound sleeper the girl said evasively you should have heard the shots repeated temple if there was any shooting maybe there was no shoot- ing at all threllen i think hake might have been lying he said he was com- ing back here early to see if he could find the man he'd shot he's not here now you didn't see him miss car- vel jean hesitated i did think i heard a horse off in the brush this morning she said but i could have been mis- taken ten to one hake was spinning us  robert dale denver a wild yarn temple said to threllen he claimed he recognized tom gary but what would tom gary be doing over here someone from the garys has been close to the ranch house several times in the last couple weeks stated threllen twice i followed the tracks of a horse back to gary gorge fum- ing threllen glanced about the timber and at the rocky rampart in which tom gary lay i say hake wasn't lying he did shoot somebody but what's become of hake all this don't look good to me if tom gary was wounded and set afoot like hake said he's likely hiding somewhere around here i'm going to have this mesa hunted over foot by foot we'll locate him if it takes us all day threllen's voice held a stubborn determination jean realized that he meant what he said her heart beat fast tom gary and his father were certain to be discovered the sky was clearing a little and the rain changing to a drizzle if threllen kept his men circling here combing the country thoroughly they would be sure to come to the shelter and that meant a gun battle which would end in both garys being slaughtered a desperate chance had to be taken to get them out of that danger jean smiled at fred temple a plan had flashed into her mind i think if you don't mind she said i'll move my wagon near your ranch this morning mr temple and camp there until my father has been found fred temple positively beamed ap- proval of this certainly he said you're welcome to do that but you don't have to camp you'll be more than welcome as a guest in our house my wife will be glad to have you he added he glanced over jean's head and frowned suddenly why there's linda he exclaimed followed us up here in this rain what got into her jean turned also and saw the girl who had saved her father from a quirt- ing riding toward the wagon this morning linda had discarded her side saddle and riding habit for jeans a man's shirt slicker and stock saddle jean noticed as the girl pulled up near the wagon that the pale face was tense drawn and the eyes were red as if from weeping jean promptly poured a cup of steam- ing coffee and took it to the girl linda stevens took it with a trembling hand fred temple and threllen had with- drawn a little distance to talk which gave jean her chance she signalled to the girl to move her horse a few paces so that both she and linda would be only a few feet from roane bran- don's hiding place--so close that he could overhear their talk you know tom gary jean asked directly the girl stared at her in wide-eyed surprise i know him yes she ad- mitted hesitantly i knew him years ago he and his brothers came to our ranch to attend school you don't hate him the girl's fingers tightened on the handle of the cup no i don't hate him she said huskily but how do you know about tom you have seen him tell me what happened you're willing to help him per- sisted jean yes anything believe me i'd do anything for him i have to listen to threllen and temple and the rest talk of murdering the garys but i love tom he's been coming to the ranch secretly to see me although each trip has meant risking his life he was to come last night but he didn't some- thing happened to him at the ranch this morning i heard that hake claimed to have shot one of the garys --tom he thought tell me what hap- pened hake did shoot tom gary shot him from his saddle but he's still alive we've been taking care of him he's not far away from here now too close canyons of the night  to be safe threllen is hunting this mesa and he'll be found sure there's no time to lose he needs your help the soul of the girl was revealed in the sudden illumination that came to her face i'll do anything she repeated what can i do tell me jean's voice became matter-of-fact casual you've got to calm yourself first i'm going to hitch up the team to the wagon and move down canyon to be near your ranch i want you to ride into the rocks where you see those two dead pines leaning against each other a few yards west of there you'll find tom gary and his father you must tell his father it's necessary to move his son at once and the only way to do that is to get him to the wagon there's a stretcher in the shelter that can be used to bring him here once here we can hide him in the back i'll drive close to the cross seven head- quarters tom can stand only a short trip otherwise i'd take him to hurley do you understand linda stevens nodded yes bring him to the ranch we'll find a place to hide him there in the cliffs threllen had ridden away to join his men but temple was lingering near the wagon when you come back jean went on you've got to get temple away from here without making him sus- picious after the girl had ridden into the trees jean hurried to get the gray team harnessed roane brandon she knew would follow linda stevens to the shelter and help gary move his son jean found herself working in a frenzy of haste with her fingers all thumbs then she suddenly got hold of herself a man's life--no the lives of three men roane tom and tom gary's father--were at stake with the team hooked to the wagon she loaded up the camp gear spreading her bed in the back for tom gary when she began work fred temple lazily sat his horse nearby chatting plainly liking to talk with a pretty young stranger but when linda stevens returned she soon disposed of temple challenging him to hurdle some fallen trees temple preferred showing off his riding skill of which he was plainly proud even to talking to jean little by little by inducing temple to race his horse against hers linda got temple out of sight of the wagon jean stood guard while roane and clayton gary brought the wounded man from the brush to load him into the vehicle then roane went back for the bed and tarpaulin while gary crawled in beside his son it will be a hard ride for him jean said it's not far to the cross seven said clayton gary they'll never think to look for tom there it was a smart idea you had we'll get him away as soon as we can though if we have to carry him every foot on a stretcher i'm afraid to trust the stevens girl with a secret like this she may mean well toward tom but she's got an insane streak in her same as the rest of the family jean went into the brush to meet roane who had brought the bedroll placed in the back of the wagon it would serve as a screen for the garys roane looked at her you're a smart brave girl he told her warmly i'm riding out now taking clayton gary's horse with me to turn loose it won't do to have him found around here then i'm riding to meet my partner want to get my hound to help hunt for your father it's rained too much for a dog to find old trails but savvy he's not an ordinary dog i'd like something your father has worn there's an old soft leather pair of shoes he wears around camp she said i'll get one of them fine if he's afoot and wandering about savvy can cut his trail in a hurry i'll see you at the cross seven tonight and i'll hope to have good news for you  robert dale denver jean forgot the danger and worry for a moment looking at roane bran- don you'll be running the risk of being shot yourself she told him all this is shooting country be care- ful you be careful he ordered you're taking a lot of chances yourself doing this for tom gary he grinned the more i see of you the more willing i am to wait for you until i'm forty but only if i have to he added a little later she sat in the front of the wagon she spoke to the team and the grays moved out chapter vi cross seven ranch the wagon following the road down the side can- yon bumped terribly as its steel-rimmed wheels hammered over stones jean flinched with each jar as if she were the wounded man in the back behind her tom gary occasionally broke out into a delirious mutter which his father tried to quiet reaching dusk canyon they turned down it toward the cross seven head- quarters they had traveled a little over a mile along this when a rider galloped up alongside the wagon-- linda stevens who had managed to leave fred temple behind jean stopped the wagon he's all right linda asked anxiously tom gary's father was looking over jean's shoulder at the rider with so forbidding a face that linda stevens shivered and what is it to you how he is gary growled she had nothing to do with tom being shot jean put in sharply feel- ing pity for the pale-faced girl there is no blame to her for the shooting gary was forced to admit but her relatives are responsible and i promise you miss stevens we'll get tom away from the cross seven neigh- borhood tonight if it's possible there is no need to hurry him away protested linda you mustn't move him until he's well enough gary's face was stern that is for us to judge he declared there is no safety for him near the cross seven ranch any more than if we were in a nest of-- evidently he had intended to say rattlesnakes but he did not finish the wagon rumbled on again with linda stevens riding a little ahead the canyon was widening now on the left were slopes covered thickly with pines on the right rose sheer cliffs now the ranch came in sight lying in the wide cleft made by a side canyon below near the creek were the corrals sheds stables and a bunkhouse the latter built of thin slabs of red rock several hundred yards above sat the ranch house it sprawled under a huge wedge of wall a big rock dwelling built in some respects like an english castle with little towers and the side walls ex- tended above the roof in a parapet which was cut with slits designed in the old days for the use of archers the walls had been built of thin rock laid by expert workmen shrubs trees and stretches of green lawn lay in terraces in front and at the side of the house it all looked like a pretentious city mansion and was as out of place in this country as a herd of giraffes or zebras behind the house lifted cliffs blood- red in color the kind of red that is somber and gloomy with a few pinions and junipers that did little to soften the somber walls in places the cliffs mounted in sheets of solid rock like curtains hung from the rims to the canyon floor in other places they had been weathered into towers obelisks various-shaped domes and cubes linda stevens pointed to a break in the cliff a quarter of a mile or so further on and about the same distance from the ranch there's a good place canyons of the night  to camp she remarked i played in there as a child we children had a secret house back under the cliff in a thicket jean stopped the team when they reached the place linda had pointed out clumps of thick brush choked the entrance to the little break in the cliff walls the wagon could be so drawn up that tom gary could be carried from it directly into the brush she looked back inquiringly at gary and when he nodded his approval she guided the team into the open space halting the wagon so that the back of it was close to the thicket then she got down to follow gary who had slipped out to enter the brushy covert through growth so thick that they had to force their way through it thirty yards or so and they found the remains of an old play-house from a low-branched andy partle tree nearby a tarpaulin could be rigged to make a shelter tent while linda acted as lookout in case anyone should ride up gary and jean got the wounded man back through the brush with difficulty after that jean gathered wood and built a fire near the wagon linda stevens would have stayed but she realized that she could be of no help and she was only disturbing tom's father by being there reluctantly she went back to the ranch while jean made a broth for the wounded man from fresh meat she and her father had brought with them andy partle came along shortly leading two pack horses roane had met him he told jean and had saddled a horse and ridden out with savvy to hunt for dan carvel andy brought jean's saddle hidden in a bedroll just leave it to roane andy as- sured her believe it or not but roane's just got a instinct for finding critters he kin jist size up a country and seem to know where to look for what he's huntin--b'ar or cougar or horses or cattle while that dog savvy has got the high-poweredest nose i ever seen in a dog they make a pair those two they found a dead man one time after the country had been gone over inch by inch of course he added hastily your pa ain't dead he'll turn up alive jean tried to believe that but it was hard if her father had met with an accident it seemed an impossible task for a man and a dog to find him in a strange country where rain had certainly washed out all tracks and yet she had faith in that young fel- low who seemed somehow to be part of the canyons the trees the mountain peaks he reminded her of the stories she had heard of the fur trappers the buckskin clad men who had wandered easily into every corner of the un- explored west often through hostile indian tribes in the strange insane world of the mighty canyons into which she and her father had traveled where cruelty and murder ruled roane brandon was a stalwart refuge the day dragged by andy partle wandered up to the cross seven and was gone for several hours clayton gary watched by the side of his son jean dozed a little and came to with a start the skies were clouded again rain was falling on distant peaks standing not ten feet from her was a man of medium height rather chunky with a sharp-featured face and  robert dale denver dark prominent eyes that shone with a malicious delight he was dressed in slovenly fashion but carried an ex- pensive hunting rifle jean was frightened there was something terrifying about the man although he smiled at her have no fear he said it is only hamlin stevens completely and entirely harm- less and you're the little girl whose father has been lost he made a clucking noise of sympathy and then smiled again this she realized must be linda stevens uncle her father's half- brother while she looked at him fearfully the man suddenly wheeled galvanized into action bringing his rifle to his shoulder he pumped all the shots in the magazine apparently at a blank spot--the cliff opposite then chuckling to himself he strolled on she waited a little and then went back to reassure gary about the shoot- ing hamlin stevens is crazy he growled raving mad oughtn't to be allowed to carry a gun a no-good that all but drank himself to death when he was young a wastrel never did a day's work in his life traveled back and forth to europe until his inheritance was all used up the shots had brought linda stevens hurrying down to camp afoot she was shaking with fear believing that tom gary had been found from the ever-ready coffee-pot jean poured a cup of hot liquid for her while she explained the firing uncle hamlin should be in an asy- lum everyone says stated linda my father got him out of plenty of scrapes he's never been responsible both my uncle and i would be far bet- ter off dead--like dad she went on bitterly we're no good to the world but i should keep such talk to myself you have your own troubles with your father missing she reproached her- self dad's all right said jean with a confidence she was far from feeling anyway i'll believe that he's all right until i have word that he isn't what good is there in worrying until then none admitted linda but you have nothing to blame yourself for with me it's different my caring for someone resulted in his getting shot his family hates all of us at the cross seven and i don't blame them and i can't be of much help to him now when he's in trouble i couldn't even save his life if they were to find him her tone changed i want to ask you jean to come up to the ranch for supper tonight--aunt erica insists on calling it dinner out here on a ranch fred temple suggested that i ask you and i want you to meet nab my nurse when i was a child andy partle knew her when he worked here years ago he's been up there talking to her for hours jean hesitated she did not trust fred temple and the further she kept from him the better george threllen was a merciless brute but she felt safer with him than with temple she did not want to go to the ranch but she could not refuse linda's invitation linda waited while jean got ready to go to the house and together the two girls walked down canyon to head for the grassy terraces below the house as they passed through a gate in a high carefully trimmed hedge they came on a tall sleek-haired woman cutting flowers from a little garden plot aunt erica said linda this is jean carvel erica temple a tight-mouthed woman who looked older than her hus- band looked at jean from cold eyes she nodded slightly dismissing jean as of no consequences an older woman had appeared--tall raw-boned this was margaret mc- nab who had been linda's childhood nurse she was a thin angular woman with hair so colorless and unattractive it could not have been helped by any- thing except a wig she bunched it up canyons of the night  carelessly and let it go at that she had long bony hands and a voice as rough as a rasp despite all this jean liked the woman at once she was plainly so blunt and honest and good- hearted the three went into one wing of the big house where a living room and two bedrooms made linda's suite of rooms nab settled down to knitting making her needles click if you take my advice both of you she said in her mannish voice you girls will both get out of here take two horses and hightail it tonight and keep riding until you are out of the country it's madness to stay here it's madness agreed linda stevens despondently that's just it--mad- ness nab laid down her knitting needles linda thinks she told jean that she's losing her mind going insane she thinks it runs in the family that's what the temples say but i say they're wrong they claim her pa went crazy and got in a quarrel with the garys and started all this war i say it's non- sense her uncle hamlin is sort of crazy but only from booze and any- way he's only her father's half- brother uncle hamlin says it runs back in the family for generations said the girl dully he says that's why he first started drinking knowing he couldn't marry with the chance of hav- ing his children tainted by insanity the temples are right i feel that i am losing my mind i've got something to tell you linda said nab those men in here --andy partle and that fellow he brought with him--they're here to help you they're not here to buy horses i asked andy to come in here to help you i sent him a thousand dollars so they could come in here and deal for horses with fred temple and i wouldn't have done that if i thought anything was wrong with your mind linda why nab exclaimed linda and hugged the woman hard you were foolish to use your money for that and i once even thought you'd turned against me that you were looking after me because you thought i was going insane that's how i got the temples to let me come here nab explained to jean they were to pay me a lot of money to testify when a hearing is held to decide if linda is what they call mentally competent or not they're the worst people i ever saw those two deliberately trying to ruin a young girl's life by getting her declared in- sane when it's all nonsense across the court a door was thrown violently open and hamlin stevens emerged in his shirt sleeves wearing flapping slippers carrying the hunting rifle he raised the weapon and emptied it at a canyon wall then reloading in a frenzy of haste he emptied the gun again linda walked out into the court to take the man's arm and talking to him soothingly conducted him back to his quarters hamlin busts out that crazy way about every so often said nab quiet- ly but it's only natural after all the whiskey he's downed as a nurse i've seen a lot of whiskey-swillin hogs but never one to compare with him a gong summoned them to dinner and when linda returned the three went into a hall-like room where a stingy fire burned cheerlessly in a huge fireplace fred temple and his wife appeared temple to rush forward to try to take jean's hands she dodged him aware of the glinting eyes of erica temple they ate in a dining room which wouldn't have been much larger in a real castle with heavy oak beams and paneled walls of dark wood it was a dreary sort of meal with only candles for light and a bald chinaman serving fred temple tried to make light talk with compliments to jean and his light blue eyes never left her hamlin stevens came in to take a  robert dale denver place when they were about through he did not eat he only stared around the table at everybody from his bugged- out eyes chuckling to himself occa- sionally linda was the only one who tried to talk to him but he paid no attention to what she said finally with a sharp sarcastic ex- cuse me he got up quickly and disap- peared finished with the meal the others went back into the hall-like room i'll have to start back said jean wanting desperately to leave nab and i will walk down to your camp with you linda offered do you think it's safe for you to go out at night linda asked erica temple some of these gary killers may be lurking around waiting to kill you as they killed your father i'm not afraid of the garys and i don't believe they killed father stated linda in a sudden flash of spirit they're not killers both the temples gazed at linda and in the silence a pin dropped on the tiled-in front of the fireplace would have sounded as loud as a shot then you don't know what you are saying said erica temple in a sud- den rage defending your father's murderers linda stevens had shown spirit against threllen in compelling the re- lease of dan carvel but now the flash of independence died swiftly and she seemed only to cower no i don't know what i'm saying she admitted tonelessly we will forget what you said said erica temple we know you are afraid that these dark canyons terrify you you must not forget what hap- pened to your father and you must hate these people who murdered him they are your enemies the woman went on in her hard smooth voice and we must be careful dear not to let fear get the best of us fear in your case is fatal you know what it will lead to you know your weakness you must guard yourself yes aunt erica said the girl meekly as for you child fred temple said to jean i think you'd better stay here in the house it's safer those horse-buyers--we don't know anything about them and they are camped not far from you i think you should stay here at the house where we can look after you i'd prefer to be in camp jean said calmly temple glared at his wife evidently blaming her for the girl's refusal to stay in the ranch house tomorrow we'll see what we can do in trying to find your father my dear he promised and took one of her hands jean withdrew it and shivered more and more she disliked and feared this temple back at the carvel wagon linda stevens asked to see tom gary if only for a moment the wounded man was breathing hard tossing about restlessly muttering deliriously linda came back to the wagon with tears in her eyes nab as a nurse went to look at him and make fresh bandages for him then the two women returned to the ranch andy partle wandered down to jean's camp roane had not yet re- turned from his search he reported jean could see that the oldish man was worried chapter vii night boat roane's partner was worried and with good reason certain- ly roane was in danger of being shot by both sides in the canyons off the night river there had been no sign all day of threllen and the riders that had been making a search on the mesa for tom gary but now the cavalcade of riders canyons of the night  came loping down the canyon with a sudden outburst of yells to pull up at the corrals below the ranch house lights came on in the bunkhouse andy partle went in to talk to clay- ton gary whom andy had known when he had ridden for the cross seven he came out finally yawning drowsily and headed for the camp he had made not far from jean's wagon the lights in the bunkhouse went out and the canyon became quiet with the storm cleared away the night was still so still that jean could hear the occasional restless muttering of tom gary she sat down with her back against a bedroll and dozed a little and then as if he had materialized there by magic roane was in camp smiling at jean over the fire found your dad he reported his leg was broken his horse had been nab shot from ambush but your father managed to get away--dragged him- self into some rocks likely some cross seven man tried to get him i got him on a horse and took him to the garys doc gary set his leg and he's resting easy except that he's worried about you you found him she could only exclaim at first while relief and grati- tude flooded her andy told me you would thank savvy he said referring to the black-and-tan hound he ran on to the fresh trails of three different mountain lions but i kept him to the notion he was hunting a man finding him was luck mostly--and savvy i left savvy at the garys--he was foot- sore you'd better travel over there tonight and get out of this country but i can't do that she pointed out if i went away the cross seven would be sure to find tom gary unless we could take him with us we can't do that tonight doc gary can't come over tonight he has to at- tend a sick neighbor woman how's tom been as well as could be expected still out of his head they plan to move him tomorrow night doc gary said it wouldn't be safe any sooner they're bringing a buckboard tomorrow night to the top of the mesa and they'll carry him to it by stretcher you'll leave then too and you she asked i'm staying here to get some of those night canyon horses they're the finest i've seen anywhere the country is full of them are they worth risking your life for sure he said besides i like this country i'd like to ranch here in these canyons trap beaver in the upper streams and hunt the mountain lions that are killing off colts this is horse country if i ever saw one he was looking at her smiling a little his eyes glowing i always knew it he said abruptly knew what she asked surprised knew that when i saw a certain face across a campfire i'd know that face belonged to the girl i'd like to see across my fire always you fit in with an outdoor fire jean she laughed at that you say the queerest things sometimes roane brandon who else would ever tell a girl that she fitted in with an outdoor fire sounds foolish i guess but it's not  robert dale denver looking across a fire at a girl seems the most natural way to me of looking at a girl my partner tells me i ought to have been born sixty years ago so i could have been a trapper but i like living in a house--a good log house and i can build one too i'll have you know i'm going to build one for the girl i marry as many rooms in it as she wants and i'm not joking i know you're not roane she said quietly and when dad and i get back to our ranch you'll come to see us we've got a big fireplace and i want to see how you look by the light of it but that will be when we're all out of these canyons of the night--if we ever are roane stepped close to her and put his arm over her shoulders lightly look he said don't you go getting afraid now after it's all over to- morrow night you'll be safe and happy with your father over in dawn can- yon she was very still a moment then but you won't be going with us you'll be staying here and will that make a difference to you he asked her eyes met him yes it will roane i like to hear you say that he told her gravely his arm tightened about her drawing her to him but i've got to stay here jean andy and i came in here to help linda stevens andy's friend--that mcnab woman-- paid a lot of money so we could come in she was silent her slim figure rigid you persuade linda to leave with you and i'll go along said roane is that a promise she demanded swiftly it's a promise it's little to what i'd really do for you jean when you're out of this i want to tell you just how much i would like to do for you--including that big log house built to your order he thought of her smile as he went to the camp andy partle had made and there near exhaustion from his two trips to the gary ranch and his long search for jean's father he rolled in and slept like a dead man but he was awake before daylight joining andy partle who was up getting breakfast andy was in a sober mood to him the situation was as dangerous as a family of children playing with a box of dynamite caps roane agreed but had he only him- self to worry about he would have been enjoying the danger these deep canyons the horses that ranged on the mesas above the deadly feud even attracted him this cross seven pre- sented a problem to him like that of catching some renegade shrewd old silvertip only this situation was one of human minds and human hands that could shoot deadly guns he had re- assured jean carvel that the danger was practically over but he knew it wasn't for one thing too many people knew of the presence of the wounded tom gary the girl linda in love with the young fellow might give away the dangerous secret in a dozen ways only thing to do said andy is to git all these females and gary out of here tonight that's a large party to move with- out any of these cross seven riders finding out about it no matter either we all git out or else we're all gone goslin's that temple and threllen are snake bloods from what nab told me if they sus- pected we ain't in here to buy horses we'd be in hot water quick they were eating breakfast when the cross seven crew of riders started from the corrals led by threllen both roane and andy put rifles under bed- rolls where they could be yanked out quickly and stuck six-shooters under their jackets threllen rode up to the fire i heard you brought in a hound is he any good at trailing demanded threllen he's got a nose can smell said roane but not after these rains canyons of the night  besides he's off hunting somewhere now trouble with that hound he trails the wrong direction sometimes put in andy like he started off wrong way on a turkey trail oncet and finally landed back at the egg shells out o which they'd been hatched out that spring this was a favorite humorous yarn among hunters but it brought no smile from threllen one of them garys was up on that mesa night before last he said harsh- ly and hake shot him outa the saddle hake's disappeared and we haven't been able to find that gary it's my idea some people know more about that than they're tellin and are keepin their mouths shut i got a hunch someone hid that man from us and that might be some of you strangers one thing he growled you'll get no horses from this ranch we got none to sell he rejoined his men and they rode on up the canyon presumably to take up the hunt again andy and roane looked after the cavalcade that feller gives me a chill commented old andy sooner we git outa here the better i'll like it he suspects us he may even git around to suspectin we got tom gary hid down here and then there'll be hell to pay in big chunks the day passed by slowly several times linda came down with nab to visit the carvel camp they brought news of a heated quarrel between the temples ending in mrs temple de- parting for hurley in a buckboard driven by one of the ranch hands the woman often left the ranch after quarreling with her husband said nab jean suggested that linda and nab go to the garys that night but the girl replied that she was not wanted by the garys and had too much pride to force herself on them there was no changing her mind roane had ridden out to pretend to look for carvel again during the ride he was trailed by several of the cross seven riders and he dared not go to the gary ranch twice during the day hamlin stevens came by with his rifle to send a sense- less burst of shots at a bare cliff wall in the late afternoon threllen and the cross seven crew returned to the ranch roane came in before sunset andy partle told him what news there was a half-mile up the canyon in a brush clump andy had discovered a buckboard that had been abandoned with a broken tongue evidently shoved off the road and forgotten andy had spliced the broken tongue and bound it with rawhide strips to make the rig serviceable it represented a possible way of taking out tom gary if it be- came necessary it should not be needed if the garys arrived as planned to carry tom to the top of the mesa where a rig was to be waiting to trans- port him the rest of the way home the sun set leaving a clear sky roane would have preferred a clouded one there were a lot of men working for the cross seven andy said he had counted nearly twenty just after sun- set several more came in from the di- rection of hurley some more recruits for the cross seven army andy re- marked according to the plan the garys were due to arrive an hour or so before midnight twilight came roane re- gretted that they had not set an earlier hour he scented danger there was a lot of restless activity at the cross seven corrals down canyon men came from the bunkhouse to go to the corrals to sad- dle a dozen men led by threllen raced up canyon to pull in suddenly by the campfire where andy partle and roane were cooking supper the riders gathered in a semi-circle about the two i told you birds said threllen that you aren't gettin any horses from this ranch so git out--now now said andy startled that meant the end of their plan to take jean carvel linda stevens and nab  robert dale denver out of the country--and to help tom gary get back home now repeated threllen harshly git your horses packed and pull your freight how about the thousand dollars we paid as earnest money to temple inquired roane talk to him about that growled threllen we don't want you in this country that's all talking to temple is just what we'll do said roane promptly yeah we demand to see fred temple said andy partle we made a deal with him and he's running this ranch he just thinks he's runnin it stated threllen you two are gittin off the range and doin it quick you're not talking to temple you're leavin we don't want strangers in here we don't know if you belong to the gary tribe or not but some queer things has happened since you come in one bein that our man hake has never showed up and we found his horse runnin loose without his saddle and bridle but argued partle we paid a thousand dollars down and we're en- titled to take out at least a few head of horses it wouldn't take a day to get the ten head we paid for no said threllen raising his voice almost to a shout git your loads on your pack horses and git ready to travel i'm sendin some men with you to see that you go to hurley they'll take you down the night river by a short cut there was nothing that they could do they couldn't fight nearly a dozen men who were plainly prepared to go into action at a word from threllen andy partle shrugged looks like we got our tickets bought for the train and the conductor is yellin all aboard  he remarked silently he and roane cinched pack saddles on their two horses and loaded them throwing diamond hitches over topping bedrolls while threllen's party watched then satisfied threl- len turned to go back to the ranch one final thing he said don't you come back in here you two what- ever you do roane caught half grins on the faces of several of the men at this remark he guessed the reason for their amusement with four men riding behind them he and andy started out each leading a packed horse jean carvel was wait- ing by the wagon and roane pulled up to talk to her while andy arranged his mount and pack horse to keep their escort of four men back out of ear- shot don't worry roane said in a low voice threllen told us to pull out but we won't go far we'll come back tonight and we'll all get over to the garys if we have to we'll hitch your team to that buckboard andy fixed and take gary out in it those four men with you she whispered i don't like their looks neither do i said roane not well enough for em to be behind me i've got a hunch they're to make sure we don't come back we'll take care of them the moon pushed up as the six jog- ged on down canyon heading for the big canyon of the night river the four men following grew careless roane wasn't sure that they had actu- ally been detailed to kill them but threllen he was convinced had a great deal more against them than just sus- picion andy partle had no doubts what- ever but that their mission had been discovered and the men following them had orders to kill them the big can- yon of the night river was opening below and the dull boom of the river came to their ears the night would make a good burial place for two strangers bodies dumped into its sandy current would never appear again when the trail narrowed so that they would have to ride single file the men behind could blast andy canyons of the night  and roane out of their saddles and roll their bodies into the river to roane this affair had more and more of the certain air of an execu- tion executions however could back- fire he and andy still had their six- shooters under their jackets and andy partle was a tough coot who could strike with the speed of a rattler fred temple roane muttered a few words to him as the trail began to narrow passing into the deep shadow of a cliff wall behind them the four were riding in pairs smoking talking a few yards ahead huge boulders bordered the trail coming to these as the trail curved a little roane and andy swung quickly down one on each side of the trail with the move they drew their six-shooters covering the riders be- hind them it was simple because the move had been entirely unexpected lift your blasted paws yelled andy or we'll blow you to pieces roane had scrambled to the top of a boulder from which he could see every move the four made they were caught flat-footed one man who had been carrying his rifle over his saddle horn hesitated but only a moment raising his hands with the rest letting the weapon fall while roane kept them covered andy took their guns working care- fully at their backs shucking them of rifles and sixguns and searching them afterward for hidden weapons what we doin with em inquired roane make em jump in the river snapped andy partle promptly these birds were sent to kill us we'll just do the same to them we wasn't sent to kill you whined one of the four just to see that you went to hurley don't lie to us growled old andy tell the truth and we'll give you a chance to live lie and we'll dump you outa your saddles we're only doin what we're ordered said one of the four we draw our pay they got word in hur- ley you was spies of the garys--least- wise that's what threllen told us and you were to shoot us and throw us in the river asked andy sternly yeah admitted the same man that was it there's a big battle com- ing up in these canyons and we couldn't let no spies be in so close to the ranch gid coulter is bringin out more men tonight and him and threllen is startin a big gun cleanup of this country tomorrow coulter sent out word about us asked roane yeah that you wasn't horse buyers he telegraphed out about you and found you didn't have ten thousand dollars to buy horses with like you claimed he's a smart bird that coulter admitted andy and now what to do with these buzzards roane glanced at a log on the river bank a big cottonwood that had been grounded there by a flood that would make a good boat for these birds he suggested we'll take off their boots so they won't walk back and let em float down the river puttin us into the river on that log protested one immediately it's plain murder there's rapids below in that case you can beach the  robert dale denver log before you get to the rapids and head back to the ranch barefoot it may take you a day or so for the trip but they won't be needing you there anyway meanwhile we want senor threllen to think that we're floating down the river the men had no choice but to obey sullenly they took off their boots and after a great deal of effort managed to roll the log into the river then they straddled the log and the sluggish shore current slowly took the strange boat out into the stream they rode fast until they neared the cross seven again lights burned in the bunkhouse besides the main house cautiously they kept to the slope op- posite the ranch until they were above the carvel camp roane went down to find jean sitting by the fire you came back she exclaimed at sight of him those men-- figured to kill us but we gave them a little boat ride in return sent em off down the river on a log his arm went around her drawing her close we got to make tracks out of this country fast we're not waiting for the garys we'll hitch your team to that old buckboard for an ambulance for tom we got to take nab and linda stevens with us there's horses for everybody do you think you could sneak up to the house and get nab and linda to come down here tell them a big war is due to break in this coun- try coulter is bringing out a bunch of men tonight to start a real war we've got to travel to dawn canyon where we'll be with friends chapter viii unseen assassin jean carvel had no trouble in getting to the cross seven ranch house un- detected lights still burned in several of the rooms but those occupied by linda and nab were dark the two were evidently asleep linda had not been told that the garys were coming to take tom away tom's father had been afraid that she might reveal the secret jean reaching one of the windows of the suite occupied by the two women rap- ped on it lightly someone stirred in a bed and the nurse nab came to the window her gaunt figure attired in a high-necked nightgown there's to be real war started in here tomorrow gid coulter is bring- ing out a bunch of men from hurley andy and roane say we've got to leave jean explained in a whisper threllen sent four men out tonight with andy and roane to kill them but they sent the four men down the river on a log we're all to go to the garys tonight and we've got to leave at once tell linda she can't stay here any longer i'll tell her and i'll be thankin the lord on my knees when and if we git outa here said the nurse i've expected to wake up and find myself killed in my bed almost any night for a long time hark horses were riding down canyon to the ranch--at least a dozen of them these jean guessed would be the group brought by gid coulter one rider came straight to the house the others went to the bunkhouse below threllen's voice came greeting the newcomer acting on an impulse while nab and linda stevens were getting ready jean went through the dark courtyard toward the lighted windows of the big hall-like room keeping close to the shadow of the wall the windows of the room were uncurtained a tall raw-boned husky with a hooked nose was entering threllen following fred temple was already in the room this is an unexpected pleasure see- ing you out here coulter temple said in his arrogant way i could do with a drink said coulter and going to a cabinet brought out a whiskey decanter and a glass and poured liquor then throw- canyons of the night  ing the drink down his throat he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand temple you been botchin up things out here he said deliberately i told you not to deal with those two men that said they wanted to buy horses they didn't come here for horses someone had em come in here--we don't know who whoever it was paid that thousand dollars just to get that pair to the ranch threllen has had them taken care of but it could have been serious you don't seem to realize you're not really running the ranch temple no sneered temple as admin- istrator of the stevens estate i con- trol most of the common stock of the cross seven company in addition to the stock i own personally stock coulter laughed just a lot of paper he poured himself an- other drink you're a slick one temple it was a slick idea making people think addison stevens had gone crazy before he was killed and ar- ranging it to get the daughter de- clared crazy legally--and meanwhile tryin to drive her crazy you figured it would be easy to prove hamlin stevens insane and with the girl and uncle declared loco by a court you'd have the same as sole ownership of the whole ranch temple shrugged no trick to it everyone knows about hamlin and it's been my opinion that linda is not mentally responsible we now have the evidence to show it in court mrs mcnab a graduate nurse will testify that the girl is not responsible a wonderful scheme remarked coulter but it's got one bad flaw you've been fool enough to overlook one thing temple stiffened i don't like your talk gid the saloonman-gambler shrugged you'll have to learn to like it i'm taking charge here tonight threllen and the others will be taking my or- ders--not yours jean carvel crouched outside the open window was watching and listen- ing so intently that she almost forgot to breathe it was like a scene from a play but no play could ever be a tenth as dramatic to her it seemed that coulter was playing with the hapless temple as the proverbial cat with its proverbial mouse threllen said temple see that this fellow leaves the ranch and doesn't come back threllen was humorless there was not the ghost of a grin on his face he merely remained grimly silent gid coulter however grinned wol- fishly and temple realized suddenly what he was up against that threllen was coulter's man and that the other men on the ranch would take threl- len's orders i see he said there seems noth- ing for me to do but to leave you in charge and have you thrown out in the courts that won't be difficult i can get friends to advance me enough to pay off the money you loaned to the ranch coulter's grin widened courts is it we're in a canyon of the river night a long ways from a court temple i hand it to you you've been playing a slick game to get this ranch by shutting up your relatives for in- sanity and at the same time driving out your neighbors you're a good enough horseman to know the ranch is a millon-dollar proposition here that the horses running on the range could bring in a couple hundred thou- sand dollars cash sold to the right parties a slick game temple but you're licked we'll see declared temple con- fidently you can't scare me if any- thing happens to me here there'd be an inquiry that would send you to the gallows i've got friends behind me my wife would see to it that they'd send in a bunch of detectives would they now asked coulter and chuckled detectives wouldn't get far in this country i'm not trying  robert dale denver to scare you i'm just making an offer i've got a few papers that either you sign or you don't leave here alive he brought out a long heavy envelope from his pocket i'll be damned if i sign anything snarled temple you can't bluff me in signing these papers said coulter you admit to being respon- sible for the killing of a few men in- cluding addison stevens you admit also to having made it look as if addi- son stevens got in a fight with one of the garys and neils when they were really killed separately by your hired gunmen and the bodies arranged so it would be laid to a gun battle and you admit that you started a war of ex- termination against your neighbors i'm damned if i sign any such thing burst out temple you'll be damned if you don't coulter's sixgun slithered up out of its holster the night river has covered up a lot of bodies in its time it's big enough to cover yours too you can't shoot a man in cold blood coulter protested temple you're not as low as that coulter's smile only widened and temple turned to threllen standing watching quietly threllen you won't let him do it temple appealed to his employee you wouldn't see me shot down in cold blood you're my friend threl- len threllen said nothing he merely looked at temple and reading that look temple knew he had no chance i'll sign he said slowly i'd have more chance against a pair of rattlers coulter spread the contents of the envelope on a table blackmail muttered temple after he had scratched his name on the bot- tom of the pages and coulter had fold- ed them up and replaced them in the envelope blackmail yes coulter admitted you'll tell the court you signed under duress of course but you're thinking wrong there temple something about coulter's tone made temple turn pale you mean you're going to kill me anyway he asked hoarsely it's the safest way for us isn't it said coulter you've always realized it yourself dead men tell no tales you've been getting up an army of men to go over and wipe out the garys and neils and mcwhirters you'll be glad to know that's going as you planned it i brought some more men to help and you'll be in the saddle here as far as anyone knows when it's over you'll be found dead and people will say it served you right while the cross seven you hoped to own for yourself will be owned by somebody else they'll even say you killed your girl cousin when she's found dead as she's going to be you'll be charged with everything and meanwhile who will take over the ranch who do you think temple you said temple who else wrong it won't be me it'll be a smarter man than i am you're look- ing at him temple temple looked at threllen and then back at coulter then he stared hard toward the doorway leading into the dining room he stood as if transfixed looking into the other room as if he saw a ghost there d-don't let him do it he stam- mered don't let him-- the rest of his words were drowned in the loud crash of a rifle from beyond that door- way fired by someone that jean could not see temple went down all at once his body collapsing to hit the floor with a thump silence followed until coulter chuckled dead center he said good shoot- ing that mysterious murder the shot fired through the doorway by some un- known saved jean carvel from an out- cry that would surely have betrayed her an ordinary murder would have brought a scream from her but this sinister deliberate killing paralyzed her her eyes were fixed on the rec- canyons of the night  tangle of the doorway but no one ap- peared in it only after a few moments was she able to move at all then horror-struck she hurried back to the window where linda and nab were waiting in dark- ness they helped her into the room where she still trembled violently then getting control of herself she told them briefly what had happened threllen had come into the court you heard that shot he called of course i heard it said nab tartly it was like a cannon how could i help but hear it i'll tell you about it in the morn- ing he said don't worry someone just accidentally discharged a gun tell you all about it in the morning he added reassuringly they waited a few minutes then slipping out of a back window they left the house a light was shining in hamlin stevens quarters through the uncurtained windows they saw linda's uncle sitting at a table which had an array of bottles on it he shouldn't be left here said linda at least we could give him warning that hog muttered nab he's so worthless that no one would trouble to kill him he's too drunk to heed any warning anyway they hurried on into a little orchard above the ranch and went through it before dropping into the main canyon when they were clear of the house jean carvel told them more in detail what she had seen and heard the threats of coulter and the shot from the unseen assassin andy had the gray carvel team hitched to the buckboard up canyon roane and clayton gary used the stretcher to carry the helpless tom gary to the rig the saddle horses had been brought there the three women swung into the saddles and they start- ed off clayton gary driving the rig slowly with andy and roane acting as guard one up ahead one at the back there was always a chance of running into some rider from the bunkhouse came an occasional yell the men com- ing out with coulter must have brought out a supply of whiskey the buckboard wheels ground on the rocky trail despite the slow pace gary used in driving but they were far enough away so the noise could not be heard at the cross seven jean's heart lightened a little with each rod of trail they covered reach- hamilton stevens ing the side canyon that climbed to the rim gary pushed the team into a trot on the easier grades their luck had held so far but they guessed it had deserted them when as they neared the rim out of dusk canyon welled a tremendous clatter of hoofs and loud- pitched yells they stopped if their flight had not been discovered the cavalcade might continue along dusk canyon or if the riders turned up the side canyon the fugitives could push into the brush to hide that hope died as the riders halted at the forks of the trail matches flared the rider group was looking for tracks plainly they were following the buck- board maybe the absence of the women at the house had been noticed at any rate the flight had been discovered  robert dale denver and they were being pursued with every available cross seven rider chapter ix barbed wire trap it was a crazy wild flight with the buckboard rattling over the rocky trail as tom gary's father urged the team to a lope the three women--jean linda and nab--were keeping close behind the rig dusk canyon was a deep well of shadow below but the moon shone full on the trail making it into a road paved with silver a road to death thought roane bran- don as he and andy checked their horses to drop behind the buckboard steadily the hoofs of the small army were hammering up the side canyon until roane and andy could catch fleeting glimpses of the horsemen some distance below the rim the two calmly dismounted tied their horses and then hurried back down the trail to halt on a narrow ledge where the road lay with a deep canyon on one side and a cliff on the other the hoofs thudding nearer became a rumble that resounded in the canyon like the steady roll of thunder then the leaders streaked around a bend and came in full sight like shootin ducks off a pond murmured andy partle crouching with his rifle barrel resting on a boulder just can't fire into em without givin em a little warning except if i knowed it was threllen and coulter headin that parade or the feller that's bossin all this wolf pack they sent one warning shot and the men pulled up at once only to come on again yelling savagely sending a hot fire from their rifles one slug tore fragments from the boulder behind which andy partle was squatted andy swore and at once opened fire roane followed suit two men plummeted from their sad- dles that was enough to halt the charge to send the riders scattering into the brush along the trail for a few minutes there was a confused shouting below while the guns were still more riders were coming up until the side canyon seemed alive with men then the guns opened up almost at once for a full minute pouring a hail of shots up trail at the two that blocked the way andy and roane sent a brisk fire in return and the firing echoing and re- echoing within the canyon walls made a deafening uproar meanwhile men were advancing afoot the moonlight helped andy and roane enabling them to make certain targets of two men who foolishly exposed themselves that stopped the advance and roane took advantage of the lull to climb cat- like up a cliff working his way along it he stopped only when he was above the vanguard of attackers when the group moved forward again roane's rifle opened up at a short range a man went down rolling out into the trail clawing at his chest screech- ing with pain bullets hammered vengefully all about roane he was forced to flatten out until the storm of lead ended soon after he rejoined andy coulter and threllen had learned a lesson and cagily they sent men in a wide circle that would take them be- hind the stubborn pair that took time and roane and andy used an old trick stopping firing in the hope that the men below would think that they had retreated the ruse worked they've gone git after em came an order in a voice roane guessed to be threllen's git your horses and run em down men mounted again to ride forward but they did not get far the two rifles opened up again and men flung them- selves frantically from their saddles this time andy and roane did ac- tually withdraw to their horses mount- ing they rode quietly on up to the rimrock to halt again canyons of the night  fearing that they would run into an- other trap the group below was slow to follow waiting for long minutes before advancing warily as if they were crossing a mined battlefield on the rim to roane's and andy's astonishment jean carvel met them that place where dad and i couldn't get our wagon across she told them rather incoherently we got the buck- board over it carried tom gary across and then dragged the buckboard with the help of our saddle horses they're traveling on don't stay too long to fight them here two of you can't hope to hold them we done a good job of it so far bragged andy partle you ride on young'un bullets don't know if it's a girl or man they're hittin git he ordered sternly and keep poundin along the trail fore long you ort to be runnin into them garys headed over this way to fetch tom the girl obeyed reluctantly riding on while andy and roane followed at a more leisurely pace with ears cocked alertly for sounds along the back trail they had traveled a mile or more be- fore they heard the faint click of hoofs behind them again andy partle lead- ing the way set a faster pace on the open mesa there was no chance of hold- ing back even a dozen men but where the road dipped into one of the big canyons running into the night they could make another stand the buck- board they judged would need a lot of time to climb up out of that canyon and go across the mesa above dawn canyon as he rode roane was thinking of the trail ahead it would be a race to reach clayton gary's ranch but getting there meant no safety coulter and threllen had enough men to force a way through the fence blocking the gorge or failing that to make a wide circle to drop in on the ranch wiping out the defenders of the gary ranch house they could ride on to the other ranches in dawn and star canyons staging a massacre at each place that outfit of killers had to be stopped the problem was how considering possible ways roane thought of gary gorge that narrow deep trench closed in by sheer rock cliffs which a chipmunk could not climb he had thought on his ride through the gorge that it would make a wonderful natural trap for wild horses in a way this chase was like many of the chases he had made to capture bands of mustangs only in this chase he was running with the hunted chased by a wolf pack that would tear them to pieces as the mesa began to dip toward the canyon they heard a sudden clatter of hoofs from horsemen ahead of them andy partle checked his mount they sure ain't circled and got ahead of us he growled no you knothead returned roane and spurred his horse it's the garys coming over for tom four riders emerged from the trees and swept toward them only to turn to ride along with the pair they could not afford to stop the hammer of hoofs was growing louder behind them of the four riders two were jean carvel and clayton gary dr will gary had been in the rescue party and had taken clayton's place in the buckboard with his nephew the other two riders were tom's brothers ed and lee they now had five men to hold back pursuit but even five were too few to hold back the little army long we can make it to the ranch all right shouted clayton to roane rid- ing alongside what happens after is what worries me there's only eight families of us living in dawn and star a fifteen-year-old neil boy came along with us to help fetch tom when we met your rig we sent him hightailing it ahead to get all the folks in the can- yons to come to my ranch to meet this gun outfit all we can do is to hole up and fight em off until outside help comes which will take a day or so if any help comes at all maybe we can do better than hold  robert dale denver em off roane returned i've trapped more than a few bands of wild horses in my life so have i returned clayton over the drum of hoofs drove em into natural corrals or pens we built but what's trapping mustangs got to do with this flock of buzzards just this explained roane you've got a natural horse trap in that gorge and with both ends of it closed you'd have a corral strong enough to hold men you've got the lower end of it closed by that fence at your ranch if you had the upper end blocked this coulter-threllen bunch would be trapped the upper end is only a few yards across and i noticed a pile of barbed wire rolls there yeah we intended to make a fence there to keep our horses from driftin over on the cross seven range that same wire strung across the gorge and helped by a few riflemen could keep a big bunch of men penned in you haven't got enough men to fight this bunch a battle on even terms but i figure there's enough of us to keep em penned in that gorge both day and night as long as the moon is as bright as it is now clayton gary silently chewed over the proposition as they dropped into the depths of the canyon he was still considering it when they climbed out they had gained on the buckboard with linda and nab still riding close behind it the rig would need time to travel the steep trenches and switch- backs by which the road descended into dawn canyon and gary gorge it was time to make another stand the four men with jean still stub- bornly staying with them halted on the canyon rim dismounting to take cover once more the pursuing caval- cade thudded up to meet a hail of shots and to scatter before it and again coulter and threllen sent men in a circle on the rim the five fanned out to meet this maneuver spreading out to keep the circlers from getting past them for fully ten minutes there was a hot exchange of shots then the men and jean carvel raced on it was only then that clayton gary gave his judgment on roane's plan that scheme of yours he said is all right with both ends of the gorge closed we'd have a fair chance of hold- ing em there a monkey couldn't climb those walls there's just one break in them that men could use to get up outa there afoot but we can watch that spot we'll try it i'll stay behind with my boys to put up that fence and build us a barricade the upper stretch of the gorge is as bare as an egg--no cover at all for men to crawl along it better let me stay in your place volunteered roane you know your neighbors you go on and get them organized to hold that fence that's where these snake bloods will try hard- est to break through gary nodded all right we'll hold em below there ought to be five or six men and older boys down there by now with more coming near the upper end of the gorge they met two of the gary neighbors men from the mcwhirter family who had come to help get tom gary back from the cross seven these two volunteered to stay with roane and lee and ed gary to block the upper end of the gorge jean and clayton gary rode on leav- ing the five men who tied their horses back of some huge boulders and waited five minutes later the first of the cross seven riders came by and then the main body a flowing river of horsemen in the moonlight pouring into the shadows of the gorge walls the five waited until the last straggling riders had gone then they set to work hastily unrolling the spools of wire fastening the strands to trees and jagged pin- nacles of rock erecting a barricade with dangling loops of wire that made a barbed tangle of metal snakes across the head of the gorge then they built boulders into a wall on a little shelf some twenty feet above the gorge floor this was to serve as canyons of the night  a barricade behind which riflemen could crouch to cover the stretch be- hind the wire trap by then at the other end of the short gorge the firing had started hot and heavy coulter and threllen were evi- dently attacking the high fence below the gary house roane was anticipating that threllen and coulter would try their old tactics if they met too strong opposition send part of their force back through the gorge to circle along the rims and jump the gary ranch on a flank fif- teen minutes later the thud of hoofs sounded along the gorge and half a dozen riders came in sight to race unsuspectingly toward the wire barrier roane and the others behind the stone barricade on the shelf held their fire until the riders swept into a moon- lit stretch when their rifles boomed it was plain slaughter two men were instantly dumped from their saddles the rest frantically scurried back leav- ing the fallen men where they lay it was plain that three men were easily adequate to hold this end of the gorge judging by the heavy firing help might be needed at the other end lee gary and roane left afoot climb- ing to the rim of the gorge and travel- ing along it until they were above the gary ranch the guns were still mak- ing a harsh bellowing bedlam of sound below so far at least the attackers had been unable to penetrate the high fence across the gorge roane's black-and-tan hound which he had left at the gary ranch when he had taken dan carvel there came from the ranch house to greet his master with his usual single deep bark stop- ping at the house roane found jean nab and two neighbor women of the garys preparing a hot meal for the fighters dan carvel was in bed demanding querulously that broken leg or no broken leg he be carried to a place where he could help in the battle tom gary was in another room with linda stevens attending him there was no time to stop at the house however the guns were raising a fresh uproar below roane hurried down to join in the defense of the ranch chapter x battle of gary gorge roane found andy partle clayton gary and two neighbors firing from behind a wall of stones loop- holed for their rifles and looking down on the high wire fence in the gorge bottom other rifle- men were located behind barricades on the slope the moon and stars were fading fast before the slowly approaching day and as roane arrived the threllen-coulter men were making use of the faint light to try an advance it was a cautious one however with men keeping under close cover as they moved forward in an attempt to reach the fence fully half of the force stayed behind to hail shots at the rifle barricades on the slope coolly calmly deliberately the garys and their neighbors fired when- ever a target presented itself before that slow deadly shooting the advance was stopped cold coulter and threllen withdrew their men to some boulders in the gorge bot- tom and the guns fell silent we got a bear by the tail remarked andy partle as he reloaded his rifle it's like having a bunch of hornets in your back pocket as long as you keep em buttoned tight in there you're safe clayton gary nodded we'll keep em there besides the two ends of that gorge there's only one way of getting out--by a sort of chimney worn by flood water they may find that chim- ney when it comes full day and crawl up it we'll have to be waiting for em he grinned at roane suddenly your mantrap's worked fine so far lee just  robert dale denver told me you didn't have much trouble at the other end roane chuckled grimly no it was the other bunch that had all the trou- ble dr will gary a cigar stuck jauntily in his mouth and lugging a long-bar- reled rifle crawled over to join them enough men down there to burn us all out if they ever get loose he re- marked i just can't believe what i'm seeing and hearing jean carvel says they killed fred temple intending to put the blame for this whole ruckus on him and she said coulter admitted he wasn't boss of all this that the boss was the man that shot temple from that room only jean didn't see who he was who he could be is something i can't figure out as full day came the shots again began buzzing up angrily then they suddenly stopped and a man after wav- ing a rag that might be called white showed himself coming closer the flag bearer was revealed as gid coulter he marched up to the fence and halted clayton gary showed himself on the slope what you wantin he called we'll give you one chance to get out of this with your lives called coulter quit now and we'll let you have a week to take your families and your stock out of these canyons you can't lick us you can't hold us down here we'll find a way out coulter said clayton astounded by the man's brass on top of all else you're a fool this country won't stand for a massacre by a red man or white you can try to blame this on temple but we know temple is dead and you and threllen and every one of your bunch will pay for this try to collect that pay snarled coulter nobody is going to do any- thing to any of us this will go down as just a neighborhood quarrel are you quitting or not it's your last chance get out of my sight raged gary before i lose control of my trigger finger we'll hunt the highest tree in the country to hang you from along with threllen and whoever is the big boss of your gang coulter retreated and the guns start- ed up again in a renewed fury some of the attackers were going along the cliff walls hunting for a way of escape while the garys and their neighbors trailed them along the rim of the gorge angling down shots whenever they saw targets one man succeeded in climb- ing to a ledge that seemed to promise a route to the rim lee gary discovered him and fired a wild shot the man however was scared and losing his hold fell some thirty feet to land in a crumpled heap the sun began to shine down with an increasing warmth that gave prom- ise of an oven heat later in the day reluctantly the cross seven riders were forced to realize that they were in a jam caught in a rock-girt pen whose two gateways were defended by stubborn riflemen there was no hope of successfully attacking those block- ing fences in daylight their best chance was in waiting until night hop- ing that a mountain storm might come up bringing a darkness that would en- able them to cut through one of the fences but coulter and threllen evi- dently weren't willing to wait they seemed possessed by the fierce desire of all trapped animals for freedom there must be some other way out and with a cautious regard for the watch- ing rifles they continued to search for it not overlooking any possible out for them it was half an hour before one of the group discovered the chimney-like crack in a cliff wall clmbing it the man came to a water trough channeled in the rock and angling steeply up- ward unaware that eyes were watch- ing from above he returned jubilantly to report his discovery shortly after- ward some ten men began crawling up the chimney with rifles fastened to their backs below the remainder of the threllen-coulter force had opened up a hot fire keeping their guns boom- canyons of the night  ing to cover the escape of part of their crew a hard climb brought the ten led personally by threllen and coulter to the bottom of a shallow well of rock just below the rim the sides of this well were some twenty feet high but slanted so that an acrobatic man could scramble up it and assist the others to join him as they rested for a few minutes from the climb a pebble fell from the lip of the well and clattered at their feet the men all glanced up nervously we could have made that a fifty- pound boulder called down roane who had been given command of the party of six men that had been waiting patiently you fellows can climb on up but leave your guns behind you you won't need them any more george threllen stared up hard at the screen of cedars that grew on the lip of the well trying to pierce the particular curtain from which the voice had sounded you're the fellow that was camped below the ranch he said accusingly damn those four that let you and your partner get away if i'd only shot you down when we had you surrounded in your camp we'd have dodged all this trouble all that's water passed under the bridge roane returned are you quittin threllen or not we're sure not letting you go back make up your mind and do it quick your outfit is too dangerous to play around with threllen stepped close to coulter and muttered something to him when coulter shook his head threllen cursed him threllen had a certain bull- headed bravery about him and just now a blind unreasoning rage go to hell he bawled as answer to the invitation to surrender and swung up his rifle to begin pulling the trigger shooting blindly at the cedar screen the first shot threw the rest of the men into confusion most of them jumped away as far as possible from threllen pressing their bodies against the sides of the deep cup in which they had been trapped as they jumped they yelled that they quit coulter and one other man turned to try to slip back down the way they had come hoping to escape from above the guns boomed a heavy echo to threllen's shots threllen went down trying vainly to keep his big legs under him even lying on the rocky floor he tried to raise his rifle to his shoulder to fire a last shot but that effort was too great for him a slug sent by lee gary had smashed through threllen's chest the man who had attempted to es- cape with coulter had been ahead of the saloonman-gambler taking a des- perate chance he half leaped half slid down a small cliff missed by the bul- lets raining from above coulter fol- lowing him frantically was not so lucky a rifle shot caught him in the back sent him sprawling with that the battle was over almost as soon as it had begun the rest of the men in the rock cup with their rifles dropped were still screeching that they quit and keeping their hands raised high as proof that they meant what they yelled they were ordered to climb from the hole leaving threllen and coulter roane and andy partle descended to look at the pair andy turned threllen over with a foot for an examination dead as a petrified injun maid he announced and i'm hopin the same for mister coulter andy was doomed to disappointment on that point coulter was still alive but able to do no more than glare up at andy likely to have to waste a lot o good whiskey and grub tryin to keep him alive until they kin hang him andy said sourly lariats had been brought and one of them now was used to lift coulter from the hole then with two of the other prisoners carrying the wounded coul- ter roane and andy started back to- ward the gary ranch threading a  robert dale denver course above the cliffs lee gary was left to guard against any attempt at further escape by way of the water course when the party reached the ranch they found that the guns of the men trapped in the gorge were still the one man who had slid back safely had returned to his companions to tell them of the disaster that had met coulter threllen and the others everything had been staked on the hope that the threllen-coulter group would be able to surprise the ranchers from the rear with that hope gone and their two leaders missing they had no resistance left hungry and disheartened they asked for a parley a little later they marched out with their hands up they were herded with the other prisoners into a little natural rock pen where they were given food and held under guard by this time nearly the whole popu- lation of dawn and star canyons had arrived at the gary ranch a few men argued hotly for a wholesale hanging of the cross seven gunmen but cooler counsel prevailed some of the men working for the cross seven might have been persuaded that they were fighting on the righteous side of a range war their punishment was for the courts to decide as for two of the ringleaders threllen was dead and dr gary gave coulter but a few hours to live a committee of three men was chosen to ride to hurley to notify not only the sheriff a close coulter friend but in addition a score of leading citizens who would be asked to come out to thresh over the battle of gary gorge and the events leading up to it meanwhile the ranchers of dawn and star canyons were quietly jubilant they had lost no men in the battle in the gorge young tom gary for the first time since he had been carried to jean carvel's camp was pronounced out of danger by his uncle dan car- vel's broken leg needed only time to mend roane brandon and andy partle had headed for the kitchen with the satis- faction that the job which had brought them to help linda stevens was done she had escaped the dangers which nab had rightly feared threatened the girl the kitchen was crowded with strange women which was all right with andy partle he barged right up to the stove grabbing an empty plate on the way roane however hesitated in the doorway and jean carvel know- ing what he had come for filled a plate with the old ranch standbys beef and beans and brought it to him then while he ate on a bench outdoors she sat beside him all over he remarked cheerfully and they raise mighty good-tasting beef in this country raise almost as good cattle i guess as they do horses can't you forget horses jean said teasingly he put down his plate and laid his hand on hers it's a good idea to try to forget things like those that hap- pened last night jean i'd rather re- member the campfires i saw in here and seeing you by their light i'd like to see you beside a lot of campfires in these canyons jean what's happened in here was horrible but it wasn't the fault of the canyons--just the wrong sort of people i like this country i'd like to stay in it clayton gary and the doctor have talked to me about taking over the job of gathering their horses and selling them i've got a better job for you that that linda told me that she'd like to have you take over the job of running the cross seven you and tom gary linda's certain now that her father was never insane and she's not afraid to marry tom it could be worked out--to work for the cross seven i guess admitted roane i'm kind of thinking that my partner will want to be over here near nab we could sell our ranch for enough to buy an interest in the cross seven but i'd do that only if you canyons of the night  stayed here too with me will you jean i'll stay wherever you are she said simply but roane there's something that still bothers me the rest seem to have forgotten it but we still don't know who shot fred temple through that doorway we don't know who en- gineered all this working through coulter and threllen she went on impetuously some man planned to have linda killed and no one knows who he is he might still be making plans you're right on that he agreed soberly doc gary has been trying to get it out of coulter but so far it's no go he turned to look at the door of the leanto where the wounded coulter had been taken the door opened suddenly and dr gary stepped out his face was flushed with anger as he turned toward the open doorway it's the least that you could do to make up a little for all the hell you fellows caused in here he shouted we'll find out sooner or later who was behind all this you might as well tell us now who was it that shot fred temple i shot him said coulter promptly from the bed where he lay it was a pleasure to see him kick and there wasn't nobody running this show ex- cept me and threllen we was only using temple cashing in on the dirty scheme he had in his head--getting addison stevens killed and starting a range war in here me and threllen we'd have got the ranch through the loan i had made the cross seven it would have been easy with linda and that drunk fool of a hamlin dead i'd have hated to kill hamlin though he's the best drinking customer i ever had hamlin was hamlin was what croaked some- one behind jean and roane they both turned hamlin stevens was sitting on a sor- rel horse ten feet from them he was clad in a leather jacket old wool shirt soiled corduroy breeches and a pair of badly scuffed english riding boots the frog-like eyes in his sharp-fea- tured face seem to bulge out further than ever he chuckled as the doctor stared at him astonished what's been going on over here doc he called a worse nightmare than you ever had after your sprees the doctor re- sponded shortly you can count your- self lucky you're still alive hamlin they were about to wipe out your whole family--to get the cross seven you probably know that fred temple was killed last night or don't you hamlin shrugged the china cook told me he said and not much loss if we had been wiped out these can- yons of the night have been bad luck for all of us stevenses beside roane jean drew in a sharp breath and her fingers were suddenly digging hard into his arm as she half arose roane looking up was aston- ished to find her pretty face drawn and pale her dark eyes staring wide at the rider on the sorrel why what's the matter jean he asked there she exclaimed in a half- strangled voice there she lifted her hand and pointed at hamlin stevens he is the one that killed fred temple he was the man that shot temple through the doorway both roane and dr will gary stared bewilderedly at the girl you don't believe me but i say he killed fred temple i know it i just feel it she went on almost hysteri- cally he was the one that would have gotten the cross seven with his rela- tives all dead he may be insane but he was smart enough to plan all this and he'll still go on killing and plan- ning dr gary shook his head no he said you're mistaken jean why hamlin he-- his voice trailed off as he looked at the rider of the sorrel the bugged eyes of the man were star- ing with a horrible fixity at the girl  robert dale denver and with a light that never shone from a sane person's eyes then a chuckle came from stevens she's right doc he said in an amused voice she's guessed it she's a smart girl--too smart again stevens chuckled and look out shouted dr gary he's got a gun jean carvel knew that whether ham- lin stevens was insane or not she faced death from the ugly snout of the six- shooter that came up from under the leather jacket and swung slowly toward her frozen she stood and then a hand and arm were pushing her back over the bench and roane was springing in front of her jean could not have lifted a finger to save herself but she screamed now realizing that roane was taking the bullet intended for her the bellow of the gun was like the crack of doom in her ears then des- perately she was scrambling to her feet the sorrel horse was jumping about under stevens who was trying to level the still smoking gun to fire again as roane unarmed was running toward the man straight into the next bullet that would come from the gun but before that shot could be fired a rifle which sounded like a cannon ex- ploded from the direction of the kit- chen hamlin stevens blood flowing from his temple toppled from his sad- dle to fall a shapeless lump on the ground jean looked back and saw old andy partle by the kitchen doorway holding a long-barreled rifle from which powder smoke curled out lazily andy looked at the fallen figure of the man to make sure that he did not need another shot and then felt of his shoulder by dang roane's partner com- plained this old blunderbuss has got the wu'st kick of anything i ever pulled trigger on ort to be a law ag'in weapons like this here jean was looking unbelievingly at roane who had turned toward her plainly he was unhurt she ran to him shakily how did he ever miss you she asked still unable to believe the mir- acle he wasn't ten feet away when he shot why honey he told her as his arms folded about her that was plumb simple i just shied my empty plate at his horse's head and the sorrel nag jumped so far hamlin couldn't have hit the side of a barn if he'd been shoot- ing from inside it he might have killed you sobbed jean look he went on gently i told you what has happened in here we'll forget it's looking ahead that we'll be doing from now on--to all the camp- fires we'll have under the stars and to that big log house with twenty or thirty rooms i'm going to build for you in one of these canyons of the river night she smiled then her dark eyes shin- ing yes roane we'll look ahead she promised when a nazi or a jappy starts to shoot across the pond you can lick him dead as doornails if you've bought your wartime bond ghost town lady by  eric howard the judge never could abide a weepy woman and so old mrs gray kept herself so busy helping out young folks she didn't have time to mourn there was no one living in chaco any more but old mrs gray her husband judge gray had died a year ago he had started the town and he had al- ways been loyal to it believing that it would come back no one except mrs gray shared that belief all of the houses in the town had long since gone to pieces but the gray house largest and best was still in good repair it clung to the side of the canyon wall above the old street and mrs gray spent many sunny hours on the big porch she was small and frail she weighed not more than a hundred pounds but she claimed she was as tough as nails she kept the old house spic and span she took great pride in her garden and her chickens once a month or so someone from the railroad town of butte city visited her the doctor perhaps or parson hardy always they urged her to move down to butte city then she laughed at them and there was something youth- ful and musical about her laughter in- variably she would feed her guests fried chicken biscuits and rich gravy cooked as only she could cook them she had learned to cook she said be- cause the judge was a man who liked good vittles she had spent her whole life in pleasing the judge and now   eric howard that he was gone she was loyal to his memory and his town he was buried on a high hill above chaco this morning having fed her chick- ens and watered her garden and swept her house the old lady sat down in a hand-made rocker on the porch never idle she picked up some fancy work gazing far off across the tawny desert as it stretched toward butte city she saw a faint cloud of dust monday--and company comin she murmured that's strange i'd better pick a mess of butter beans and dress a fryer or two no tellin who it might be could be one of the syndicate men judge come to buy the mine she laughed quietly but we won't sell not us chaco's our town and we'll hang on she reached for a pair of field-glasses and held them to her blue eyes bless my heart she said it's a lady wonder who it can be none of the ladies in butte like to ride any more all soft and fat and lazy the way town folks get well whoever it is she'll be here inside an hour i'd best get busy she hummed as she worked she had discovered long ago during her first years of loneliness on the desert that if one didn't stay happy one would be miserable that was her philosophy and it worked well if you have to scrub a floor she often said you'd better sing at it she was again sitting composed and serene on the wide porch with her food all ready for the stove when the rider came up the trail through her field-glasses she saw that her visitor was young and slender the girl paused now and then to look over the deserted ghost town when she was dismounting just be- low mrs gray went to the porch rail and called down good mornin to you the girl looked up and smiled oh good morning you're mrs gray aren't you nobody else take your horse around back put him in the corral i'll be out there in a jiffy thank you mrs gray liked the girl's looks it was nice to have a visitor like her for a change someone young and happy- looking mighty sweet face she murmured pretty auburn hair framin it mighty near the color of her sorrel looks capable too and not foolish like some i can think of she hurried through the house and out the back door the girl had led her horse into the corral and was now unsaddling it's been a hot trip she said smil- ing at the old lady come on out on the porch and get cool there's water there and some hay your horse'll be all right the girl followed her through the house to the porch looking at the old furniture mrs gray urged her to sit down and she herself took up her needlework she waited quietly for her visitor to speak i'm mary grant the girl said and i've come all the way from my uncle's ranch up near denver mrs gray nodded the judge and i visited denver a few times a pretty city we stopped at a grand hotel and we had a wonderful time the judge bought me a dozen silk dresses and we went to dances and theaters she laughed to herself the judge was my husband mary the folks here made him judge when chaco was a big town they told me in butte city that you live here all alone yes i do bless me if i know why anybody would live in butte when they might live in chaco it's my town and i like it the girl frowned i came here to meet jerry lansing she said i couldn't believe what they told me in butte city because you see jerry wrote me that he was here--that he'd be waiting for me here they said they hadn't heard of him that there was no one around here by that name ghost town lady  jerry lansing no i can't place him there was a lansing here years ago tom his name was i remember him a big quiet man the judge liked him i recall i don't understand it the girl said she drew an envelope from the pocket in her blouse and took out a letter she read it he says as plain as anything that i should be here the th he even told me where to hire a horse in butte city to ride out here he says he final- ly struck it rich and that we'll be married and go on south to the ranch he wants to buy mrs gray sensed her worry well she said quietly the th is tomorrow this mr lansing may turn up by then have you known him long oh yes for years but i haven't seen him for nearly four years i haven't heard from him very often but--well we always planned to be married so-- well when this letter came i just skipped and now-- come on into the kitchen with me mrs gray suggested i was just goin to fix dinner i can't understand why no one seems to know jerry or why he wanted me to meet him here instead of butte city he didn't tell me chaco was a ghost town it isn't mrs gray said crisply not while i'm here she put the girl to work in the kitchen to take her mind off jerry lansing she herself whipped up a batch of biscuits floured the chicken and set the butter beans on to cook as she worked she spoke cheerfully of her garden and her happiness in chaco while the chicken was browning in the big skillet she heard a horse outside and went out on the back porch well tommy barnes she called out happily you're just in time come in deputy sheriff tom barnes swung down from the sad- dle and walked toward her spurs jingling he swept off his big hat and smiled at her you've got company he asked glancing at mary's horse yes a young lady from denver she was in butte yesterday rode out this mornin so wash your face and slick your hair down tommy get a hustle on she spoke to him as if he were still the ten-year-old chaco orphan who had run errands for the judge tommy was used to that i haven't been in butte for a week he said trailin a feller he got away from me then you'll be ready for something good to eat who was he tommy goes by the name of jud lane robbed a bank down below i was right close to him the son of a gun just melted away i can't understand it i'm ashamed of you the judge taught you to track anything on feet well hurry up the table's set tom barnes washed up outside combed his dark hair and then walked into the kitchen mary grant was stand- ing at one side neatly slicing tomatoes from mrs gray's garden it wasn't strange that tom saw her first the light from the window fell upon her hair and made it golden tom looked at her for a long moment scarcely hearing mrs gray's introduction oh if you're a deputy sheriff mary said you've probably heard of jerry lansing maybe you know him he wrote me once that he had been helping the sheriff no tom shook his head i can't say i've heard of him well it's the strangest thing mary declared all his letters lately have been mailed from butte city yet nobody knows him lot of prospectors up in the hills tom explained might be one of them of course mrs gray agreed he'll show up tomorrow mary eat hearty folks  eric howard early in the afternoon tom an- nounced that he would have to be getting on back to butte mrs gray asked i reckon--if i don't pick up the trail again well good-by if this gent doesn't show up miss send me word i'll look for him mary smiled at him oh i'm sure he'll be here jerry wouldn't disap- point me we're going to be married you know tom rode off and mrs gray spent most of the afternoon talking about him--what a fine boy he was what the judge had thought of him how he had lost his parents when he was just a lad and how he had worked and proved himself mrs gray retired early after a light supper after showing mary to an old- fashioned room mary was sitting be- fore a long mirror with a lamp on her right brushing her hair when she heard a faint tapping on the window the sound startled her and she dropped the brush sh someone whispered don't wake the old lady it's me--jerry turn that lamp down trembling mary obeyed jerry's voice sounded strange deep and harsh but after dimming the light she moved close to the window jerry she whispered hello sweetheart he said i saw you when you rode up here but i didn't want the old lady to know i was around then that deputy sheriff-- how are you mary i--i'm fine jerry the girl said uncertainly but--but why doesn't anyone know you why didn't you want mrs gray to see you i don't understand i can explain all that i told you i struck it rich well when that hap- pens in this country a man has to keep it secret now listen you stay here all day tomorrow just before sundown you tell the old lady

whispered another thing--don't call me jerry i've had to use another name so they wouldn't get wise to what i've been do- ing if they knew i was lansing they'd know what i was after call me jud mary jud lane jud lane mary gasped her hand against her lips yeah good night see you tomor- row before she could speak he had drifted into the darkness crouching near the window the girl stared out in- to the night jud lane--that was the name of the man tom barnes was hunt- ing he said he had robbed a bank for a long time mary was motionless hopeful of a new life with jerry whom she remembered as a gay and handsome and daring boy she had burned her bridges she couldn't return to her harsh stern uncle with whom she had lived but she was afraid of the future almost afraid of jerry he had changed even his voice had changed if what tom barnes said was true he had changed beyond all belief she heard a deep sigh from mrs gray in an adjoining room she list- ened but the old lady seemed to be asleep quietly mary prepared for bed she lay perfectly still looking out into ghost town lady  the night she couldn't sleep if jerry lansing had become jud lane bank robber she knew that all her romantic dreams of escape into a new life were ended and yet she told herself she owed it to jerry to give him a chance to explain perhaps tom barnes was mis- taken tomorrow she would meet jer- ry as he requested and she would lis- ten to him then she would know what she must do mrs gray greeted her in the morn- ing with a bright smile and a happy word mary looked tired and pale but it was impossible to be discouraged in mrs gray's presence the little old lady boasted of the size and freshness of her eggs and cooked more of them than mary could eat after breakfast she stacked the dishes took the girl with her into the garden she talked a good deal about tommy barnes when mary became pensive mrs gray put her arm around her and said now don't worry honey if this beau of yours isn't here today he'll likely show up tomorrow you're welcome to stay with me just as long as you like i en- joy havin you here thank you but i'm sure jerry will be here today tommy might show up too he never gives up tommy don't he'll likely catch that man he's after might stop in with his pris'ner mary trembled and looked down the hill somewhere down there jerry lansing--jud lane--was hiding not wishing to be seen by mrs gray or the deputy sheriff but the day passed swiftly and pleas- antly in spite of her disturbing thoughts mary caught herself laugh- ing at things mrs gray said she real- ized why it was that the old lady could live here in chaco all alone she never let herself be bored she was tireless and energetic she seemed to think of herself as very young late in the afternoon mary said hesi- tantly i guess jerry isn't coming to- day i--i'd like to ride down the hill and look over the old camp she felt that she was being dishonest especially when mrs gray peered at her through her steel-rimmed specta- cles go ahead child if you want to she said and when you look around try to picture the town as it was--when it was boomin ah it was some place then she watched mary ride off down the slope ah the poor chick she murmured off to meet that worthless bank-rob- bin jud lane jerry lansing that was it's hard to say mebbe he was some ac- count four years ago when last she saw him the desert makes or breaks a man the judge always said wonder if he could be any kin to tom lansing doubt it though tom lansing was a square man well the poor girl don't know which way to turn i could tell that last night listening to em talk i guess they don't know a person my age don't sleep much just rests and dreams he said i was sharp--seemed kind of afraid of me well old lady up and at em tommy must a gone on to butte or he'd a seen your signal the old flag flyin i don't see how tommy missed this jud lane though i'd best be goin down there no tellin what lies he'll hand out hastily she caught up a sunbonnet knotted the strings under her firm chin she was wearing an apron she left it on and when she took a gun from a wall rack she thrust it under her apron then lifting her skirt she hurried down a steep trail she said of herself that she was as sure-footed as a goat and she ran like a girl down the slope pausing near a tumble-down shack that had once been a mine office she looked ahead mary's horse was there near the old sliver queen buildings the girl and jud lane were not in sight mrs gray advanced cautiously her head a little on one side now and then she halted to listen ah she said  eric howard it was not that she had heard any- thing but she saw now where jud lane must have found a hide-out where he had disappeared when tommy barnes was trailing him there was a mound of slag ahead the ground was covered with it a horse would leave no tracks there over on one side against the bare hill there was a tun- neled opening a heavy door led into it she knew that inside down a dark passage there was a large timbered circular room a man could hide there could keep his horse inside could even build a fire without being detected the smoke would slowly drift upward through cracks and crevices disappear- ing before it reached the open mrs gray advanced to the heavy door it had been padlocked and chained but the lock had been broken off it was open a few inches she put her shoulder against it and slipped into the dark tunnel closing the door be- hind her she heard the man's voice then it was low harsh argumentative i told you that mary my uncle tom lansing was here long ago gave my father a map before he died it showed where he cached this gold when a bunch of cutthroats tried to rob him my father always planned to come here never got to it i had to go about it secret cause this property still belongs to the silver queen mine company but the gold is mine heired from uncle tom that's why i took this other name moved in secret these lawmen would claim i was stealin from the mine company if    come on girl you know me well enough to trust me it's gettin dark we'll ride south mary grant was silent for a moment then she spoke with an effort as though it pained her is that the truth jerry--jud you've taken nothing but this gold your uncle-- of course it's the truth he de- clared what's the matter with you your wrote me how things were up there with your uncle and i sent for you you oughta show a little grati- tude come on it's time to leave wait jerry please just one thing more the deputy sheriff tom barnes was looking for you for jud lane he said you had robbed a bank why should he say that jerry if--if you didn't barnes you takin his word against mine why would i rob a bank that feller barnes is just another crooked lawman workin for the mine comp'ny and other big outfits those fellers are always down on poor men railroadin em to jail and kickin em around that's why i had a friend of mine pick up my mail in butte i didn't want to run into that crowd but you wrote me that you had helped the sheriff mary quietly re- minded him you said-- we've got an all-night ride ahead of us girl he cut in we've got to get started you trust me don't you you were eager enough to get away from that stingy old uncle o yours there's no time to chew the rag now the girl spoke slowly i don't know she said i think i've made a mistake i'm not going jerry i--i just can't he seized her shoulders roughly she gasped you're goin all right he mut- tered there was another sound in the cav- ern-like room mrs gray standing in the tunnel stiffened the sound was that of a man groaning as he twisted and writhed on the floor what's that mary cried who-- jerry lansing swore under his breath never mind that he snapped you stand right here i'm gettin my horse but the girl ran to the side of the room it's a man roped and tied what have you done jerry it's--it's the ghost town lady  deputy sheriff tom barnes oh jerry get away from him he got what he had comin sneakin in here work- in for the mine comp'ny tryin to stop me from gettin what belongs to me the next time i hit him i'll cave his skull in he caught mary by the arm and pulled her away from the man on the floor the girl sobbed and said oh jerry what has happened to you he didn't bother to answer that mrs gray slipped into the room swiftly moved along the wall she knelt beside tom barnes she found a knife in his pocket and cut the ropes that bound him she put her hands on his head close to him she whispered tommy tommy you must-- sh he warned her thanks i'll take him now here's some matches wood over there get a fire goin so i'll have some light on him careful tommy he's armed and dangerous the deputy pulled his knees up shook his head he slowly got to his feet across the room mary was sob- bing almost inaudibly jerry lansing was putting a bridle on his horse tom barnes moved across the floor he heard the girl gasp as she saw him then he leaped he got his left arm around the other man's neck his right hand closed on lansing's wrist he bent him over backwards lansing choked and muttered then to free him- self from tom's hold dropped to the floor but the deputy sheriff clung to him and they rolled over and over fighting hard mrs gray pulled dry bark from ce- dar wood and applied a match a flick- ering flame played over the damp walls of the timbered room take him tommy boy she urged mrs gray mary gasped you-- come over here honey the old lady said i heard a lot of what he told you and if i ever heard a man lyin he's it that story of his is plain fishy if he struck it rich tom said how--by robbin a bank leave him to tommy but tom barnes wasn't proving ade- quate to the task of subduing lansing the latter outweighted him by some twenty pounds tom's head ached from the gun-clubbing he had received his whole body seemed stiff and awkward refusing to obey his will lansing's powerful arms and superior weight were too much for him knowing that he must break the clinch and get room to strike at lans- ing he exerted his full strength and broke away in a stand-up fight his skill and quickness would serve him well he leaped back from lansing as the latter jumped up then tom charged striking out with left and right lansing did not meet his rush in- stead he retreated mrs gray had added light wood to the small fire now the whole room was illumined bright- ly- lansing backed against the wall crouching his hand darted down to his side his face dark and bitter was twisted into a mask of rage his gun cleared leather goin to kill you this time he muttered no no jerry mary cried she started toward him but a gun spoke before she had taken more than one step lansing's arm extended as he aimed at tom barnes dropped to his side the gun fell from his fingers he stared across the firelit circle and saw mrs gray then he looked down at his bleeding arm you-- he muttered me said mrs gray with satisfac- tion you're not the first man i've had to shoot but i declare i haven't felt so much like killin one for years the judge always said-- tom barnes suddenly lunged a well aimed left an uppercut clipped lansing on the chin he dropped the deputy sheriff knelt beside him got out handcuffs and snapped them on his wrists then he rolled up lansing's  eric howard sleeve and bound the wound with a clean handkerchief i was wanderin around tryin to pick up his trail tom said when i saw your flag i come back here and tried to figger things out finally added two and two when i saw the lock busted off the door here he must a heard me he was waitin in the tunnel and he clubbed me down well lady as the judge used to say you're dynamite when you get riled mrs gray laughed had to be in my time she said where's your horse tom i didn't see it outside anywhere he likely put it in a shed or some- where after layin me out well let's get out of this hole the old lady said briskly she crossed over to mary and put her arm across the girl's shoulders come child you've just got to get used to the idea that men change here on the desert can you manage him tom sure tom said you go on ahead mary was crying softly as they went out through the dark tunnel into the twi- light mrs gray left her there for a moment and crossed over to a nearby shed she flung the door open tom's horse still saddled and bridled was there she led the horse out and told mary to mount her own go on up home honey she said gently we'll be along put the ket- tle on tom will need some strong coffee--and i could use some too tom led lansing's horse out of the tunnel lansing was lying across the saddle tom was carying a pair of saddle bags bank money's in here he said that story about his uncle's cache of gold--i reckon he just made that up i think so tommy he had to have some explanation of how he struck it rich for mary he knew that a fine sweet girl like mary wouldn't stand for crookedness she is a fine girl tom- my i'm goin to keep her with me she's had a hard time of it livin with an uncle that didn't want her dream- ing of this man as he was when he was a boy i'm going to tell her i'm gettin old and need her here you back me up on that tommy i sure will tom barnes said and grinned i'd hate to see her leave the country we're kind of short of pretty girls around here mrs gray chuckled it was high time she thought that tommy began to pay attention to pretty girls tom led lansing's horse up to mrs gray's house she followed leading his they put the animals in the corral and tom lifted lansing from the sadle he was able to stand now but all the fight had gone out of him mrs gray stood before him while tom unsaddled and fed the horses she looked steadily at lansing he gave her a surly insolent stare she slowly shook her head it's too bad she said i can see the kind of boy you must a been un- ruly and ambitious wanting to get what you wanted no matter how not strong enough to stick to the slow hard way too bad tom lansing didn't have your raisin cut out the sermon lansing snapped if it hadn't been for you i'd a won yeah i'd a been on my way you couldn't have won mrs gray said tommy would have got you if not tommy then the sheriff or mary mary would have found out how you struck it rich she wouldn't have stood for it we've had your kind in chaco before you've never won and i'm al- ways sorry for you lansing muttered something turned away from her and glared at the deputy sheriff how'd you get on my trail in the first place he demanded you made a mistake tom said you fellers always do that no- good friend of yours in butte the feller ghost town lady  you had pickin up your mail and buy- in you supplies so's you could keep out of sight you paid him off out of the bank money you stole he started spendin it he got drunk and talkative and we picked him up lansing swore mrs gray said sharp- ly no bad language young man not in chaco not before ladies the judge made that rule and it still holds you let one more hell or damn out of you and you won't get a thing to eat i've fed plenty of badmen--but no cussers mind your manners feller she means it and she's the best cook in ten counties you act decent and i'll treat you square tom's tone was easy-going friendly lansing looked around at him i was goin to kill you he said don't you hold that ag'in me not no more not since you didn't make it fact is he grinned it could be i owe you somethin lansing didn't bother to ask what he meant his face strained he said and his voice broke i can't face mary go ahead--lock me up somewhere but don't drag me in there in front of her he locked lansing in the cellar mrs gray prepared a tray of good food for him and tom carried it down mrs gray followed with iodine hot water and bandages she skilfully cleansed and bandaged his arm we'll head for butte tonight tom said might be best he don't want to see miss mary mebbe she don't want to see him so we'd better ride the old lady nodded come up and eat first tommy mary wasn't in the big old kitchen she had gone into her bedroom she stayed there she'll be all right mrs gray said it's a shock of course but she'll quiet down here with me in chaco when'll you be comin out this way again tommy i get sunday off if you'd invite me real nice i'd dress up and pay you a call i'll be lookin for you but it was mary who was looking for him that sunday morning she was on the porch and she saw him a long way off when he came close she called out a greeting to him tom took off his hat and waved mary ran down to speak to him what will they do to him mary asked most of the bank money is recov- ered so the bank don't feel very mean i reckon he won't get more'n a year and the sheriff says he's goin to straighten him out he can do it oh he gave me a letter for you thank you mary said go ahead and read it i'll hunt up mrs gray i'm sure glad you're stay- in with her she needs you mary didn't mention lansing's letter when she joined them on the porch she was quiet and subdued but not un- happy she smiled quietly later at the table she burst into laughter at something mrs gray said tom didn't leave until it was dark then he called out i get next sunday off too am i invited you know you are tommy mrs gray said sunday after sunday tom showed up in chaco it was on the sixth of these sundays that mrs gray about to call them in to dinner looked out of the back door and saw mary and tom near the corral they were gazing deeply into each other's eyes then they embraced and tom bent down to kiss her mrs gray quietly retreated and pushed the skillet back on the stove they won't be hungry for quite a spell she murmured think of it judge little tommy barnes growed up and kissin girls but she's a mighty sweet girl judge they make a fine couple you'd be proud of tommy she wiped away a tear and got very busy lest she weep if a person started crying every time she felt like it it might get to be a habit that would never do the judge couldn't abide a weepy woman poker winnings by  austin corcoran strange how a poker game years back could influence the lives of so many people and even bring young folks together to conquer problems and to love bill avery was on edge with excitement as he swung himself down the steps of the smoker when the train pulled into hanover this was several stations before his destination but he would go on by horseback and he could make it to indian creek by dark the trail over the ridge being considerably shorter than the route followed by the railroad but this wouldn't fit into bill's plans he had waited seven years for this return to the red hills country which had finally come with such astonishing abruptness his right hand went in- voluntarily to a pocket of his leather  poker winnings  jacket the rustling of paper giving reality to his recent hurried move- ments and it came to his mind that every tick of his watch might now mark some incident that could material- ly affect his future course this thought quickened his step and added keenness to his glance as he went along the street to the livery barn with the intention of at once arranging for the use of a good saddle horse turning into the wide entrance of the j d watson livery barn he faced a significant group a tall showily dressed young fellow held the reins of a restless thoroughbred with one hand while the other rested caressingly on the shoulder of a strikingly pretty blonde girl the features of his down- bent face were concealed by the wide brim of his hat but bill caught the trustfulness of the blue eyes and a wist- ful tremor of the girl's lips as she smiled up at her companion his words were audible as bill passed terribly sorry edna i can't stay over this time he said got a mighty important piece of business coming up in indian creek tomorrow but i'll be seeing you soon honey the smooth pacifying note in his voice brought a wry twist to bill's tanned features one of those promising birds he thought going on into the office when he emerged both the rider and the girl had vanished bill promptly forgot them in the absorption of his personal problems until that evening he was sitting on a bench in the tree- shaded square around which the town was built when the blonde girl passed his gaze clung to her noting again the charm of her features and slender soft- ly rounded figure that's edna watson his compan- ion on the bench explained old j d's daughter--and as fine a girl as she is pretty it's a damn shame van carter's got his eyes set on her van carter bill repeated hastily his jawline hardening yep--only son of lem carter over in the indian creek country van come to one of our dances got a good look at edna and swung his loop for her pronto he's the sort that's got a girl in every town within ridin distance but when he marries it'll be some- body with a dad a lot richer than j d watson the carters have money bill asked careful to speak casually i'd say they have was the reply what lem hasn't got by luck he has grabbed by chicanery of some kind he's about got a strangle holt on his section of the country the strong fingers of bill's right hand closed in a tight grip his gray eyes had the hard chill glint of steel here was corroboration of his own be- lief had it been folly to return to the neighborhood of the old avery ranch to place himself in close contact with the carters could he go ahead quietly with his plans without betrayal of what he had in mind perhaps his mother had been right and he should build his life against a new background far from the scene of memories with their stabbing questions which would re- quire a near miracle to supply answers i'll stay he vowed silently how- ever affairs work out an avery was the first settler in the red hills the first white man on indian creek my grandfather laid out the town we be- long here--our roots are deep in the soil and if there's a clue to what happened that night i'll find it the stores had been open but a few minutes next morning when bill rode into the little cowtown of indian creek going slowly past well remem- bered buildings and glimpsing an oc- casional familiar face stopping be- fore a red brick two-story structure he glanced up at the windows above the double-front store one bore in fading letters samuel ordway attorney-at-law satisfaction in his expression bill tied his horse and mounted the sag-  austin corcoran ging stairs at the side of the building a moment later he opened the first door on the narrow hallway the man at a rolltop desk glanced up penetrating hazel eyes appraising his visitor a gleam kindled in their depths and the hard lines of his mouth relaxed as he exclaimed bill avery right first guess bill said come back to stay when the two men had shaken hands a firm grip bill drew a folded news- paper clipping from his pocket ex- tending it to the lawyer has that place been sold he asked ordway's bushy eyebrows drew into a frown as he read the printed lines not yet he replied but-- fine bill broke in i want you to put through the deal for me i've kept an eye on things here through the county paper as soon's i read that old nate parks was paralyzed and his wife wanted to sell out quick it was like a signal to me that now was the time to come back it won't do ordway said flatly nate's ranch parallels lem carter's south range lem's wanted it for years on account of that big spring he's got a fifteen-hundred-dollar mortgage on the land and buildings the bank's already got the cattle lem's offered her a thousand dollars cash to cancel the note and turn the place over to him she'll do it the note's due this week and not a soul would dare raise lem's ante i will bill stated calmly i'll give her three thousand cash yes thir- ty-five hundred if i have to and she can take up the note you're crazy ordway rasped you're the last man who ought to start trouble with lem carter bill leaned across the desk to gaze closely into the attorney's eyes why should he have it in especially for me he asked he got our ranch and we just faded out of the picture answer me sam--why the lawyer's frown tightened he looked away then his eyes turned slow- ly back to hold bill's gaze i don't know he replied with undeniable hon- esty but i do know that he hates the very name of avery when i was closing up the business for your mother i sensed that he could hardly wait un- til you folks were out of this country he's grabbed a lot of land and put over some damned hard deals but there's never been a pin-point of illegality in one of em and he don't appear to have any personal feeling about any of the others that's because there was something crooked about his getting our ranch bill said grimly couldn't have been orway ob- jected that deal was dead open and shut i tried damned hard to find a crack in it lem held the unpaid notes and your father's death was pure acci- dent he was caught by flood water in wide wash his horse was swept away and he was flung on those rocks true bill agreed but i'll never believe nor will my mother that dad gambled away the money he got for his cattle i do believe though that he rode round and paid carter before he crossed the wash the notes lem later showed up were forgeries made after he knew my father had been killed two witnesses proved that jason avery lost every cent he had on him in that poker game at spike dober's saloon ordway said a bartender bill scoffed and-- tod bixby foreman of the x bar outfit the lawyer put in also an ex-convict i've learned bixby did time in the colorado state pen for forging the name of lem cart- er's brother-in-law on a check of course carter knew this and it gave him a hold on bixby forged notes-- carter gets the ranch and the money see what it adds up to bill asked tensely guesswork--and dangerous busi- ness ordway declared seriously digging back seven years is too deep i advise you-- wait bill exclaimed the fel- poker winnings  low supposed to have won in that game could settle the question a stranger from new england-- drifting around for his health with a pack outfit ordway said nobody even knew his name he was a dude and i figure he'd stop in town sometimes bill persisted i had a hunch to look at the register in hanover and found that a philip well- man of orchard beach maine stayed there two nights before the game write and see if he's the man we want after some further argument sam- uel ordway agreed to carry out bill's requests but keep your suspicions to yourself he warned insistently and don't start anything with lem carter bill went next to the post office two small boys were pummeling each other and scuf- fling around the lobby evading them he halted near the general delivery win- dow to wait his turn reflections on his recent interview with the lawyer were broken off abruptly when he glimpsed a girl in the corner of the room she stood with arm uplifted to open the last box in an upper row and the beautifully modeled contours of her figure and the cameo clearness of her profile were outlined against the white- washed side wall her skin was only lightly tanned and there was a lovely rose color in the visible cheek dark brown hair as soft and glossy as a bird's wing was gathered into a coil at the nape of her neck interest kindled rapidly in bill's eyes as he watched her deft graceful movements several letters were thrust into her handbag one she gazed at for a mo- ment then a hand flashed to her hair slender fingers grasepd a pin and slit the envelope unfolding the sheet of paper this contained she remained mo- tionless oblivious to everything be- yond the written lines she was read- ing when bill's turn came he asked vaguely for mail the girl was mov- ing slowly from the corner now her attention still on the letter suddenly the wrestling boys swung around striking her violently and flinging her forward off balance bill caught her before she struck the floor lifting her to her feet and steady- ing her with a firm arm the open letter had slid from her grasp and the handbag had been flung against the wall with a force that opened the catch and scattered the contents oh--thank you she exclaimed in a contralto voice that made bill feel tingly inside and he saw that her eyes were a deep blue with those in- tensely black pupils that have such a look of mystery no i'm not hurt just surprised she laughed one man hustled the boys from the lobby with a sharp reproof and another gathered up the handbag and spilled articles bill stooped for the open let- ter and without intention his eye caught the lines martha darling i must see you when you come to town wednesday will be at the hotel at noon if i miss you will ride out to the ranch something quite serious has happened and i-- bill wrenched his eyes from the let- ter his face burning uncomfortably as he handed this to its owner the clerk was calling attention to the mail he had asked for and he stepped back to the window when he turned the girl had vanished the incident had filled no more than five minutes yet he felt as if a long time had elapsed since his entry to the post office a confusion of impressions and unfamiliar emotions stayed with him as he went slowly along the street he heard the echo of a voice--a laugh and saw her on the porch of the hotel those eyes--how deeply blue and ex- citing they were remembering them gave bill a sensation of dizziness he halted striving to concentrate on the small happenings about him but  austin corcoran the teams and horses in the street the passing pedestrians had a look of un- reality snap out of it he com- manded himself you're having a pipe dream remember--some fellow calls that girl martha darling and that's that grinning wryly he stepped off at a brisk pace but the girl in the post office continued to haunt the edges of his mind and vainly he reminded himself that it was none of his business who had written the letter that brought the blush to her cheek probably if he saw her again his impressions would be quite different no girl was as re- markable as he remembered this one as noon approached he felt an in- creasing urge towards the hotel final- ly he whirled and strode rapidly in that direction it was the best place in town to eat he excused himself and he was going to take a room there anyhow situated on a corner a porch ex- tended across the front and down the street side of the building wooden chairs stood in a stiff row behind the railing but all were empty of occu- pants only the clerk was in the office where the wall clock assured bill that it was nearly half past twelve missed her he thought with rising irritation that he should feel that decided pang of disappointment a hurrying waitress indicated the one empty place in the dining room a chair at a table near the kitchen door bill turned that way glancing indif- ferently over the crowd he had nearly reached the corner when he came to sudden attention the girl was there-- on his left she was intent on what her companion was saying and did not see bill he paused briefly sizing up the oc- cupant of the other chair at her table the back of a longish head covered thickly with chestnut hair a shirt of heavy amber satin a belt adorned with wide silver conchas--of what did these remind him he couldn't decide but he did know at once that he resented his presence martha was as interest- ing as he had remembered--more so bill concluded darting a glance that way as he slid into his chair but what the devil was that bird saying to bring an alarmed look to her face now that was softening she was startled and confused do you know that fellow in the yel- lowish shirt he asked the waitress who came for his order she nodded sure--that's van car- ter she replied and martha leeds is with him i guess they'll be gettin married soon she's a smart girl if she gets van to settle down van carter bill's mind was churn- ing wildly of course--he was wear- ing that same outfit last night in hano- ver when i saw him with the blonde so this is the important business he had on today bill thought boiling with anger as he unobtrusively studied mar- that leeds and considered what he knew of young carter he scarcely noticed when his din- ner was set before him and when the sash curtain on the window at his right blew against his cheek he struck at it with positive savagery wish it was van's head i punched the damn sneak making up to a girl like that at the same time he's got that sweet little watson kid to thinking he's all for her he noticed that martha ate almost nothing she appeared worried and ex- cited her color fluctuating rapidly when they rose from the table van slipped a hand through her arm with proprietary assurance bill was tre- mendously pleased at the dignity of her carriage an aloofness which discounted her companion's manner again bill's anger boiled high as he recalled the martha darling in what was likely van carter's bold script and he stabbed furiously at the food on his plate he was oblivious to footsteps on the porch outside the window until aroused by an unmistakable contralto saying it's too dreadfully important van to make such a quick decision and when dad feels as he does-- poker winnings  he'll take it all right when we're actually married honey came in the same smooth voice bill had heard speaking to edna watson the previous day and you'll be helping him it's a bad business his getting mixed up with harve finley but if we're mar- ried my father will fix things up as soon as i heard a hint that ben leeds might get in a jam i figured this out we'll take the afternoon train over to the county seat get the license have the knot tied and take a nice little honeymoon over the week-end but van--i'm not sure martha protested leave all that to me was the sooth- ing reply just sit here while i run over to the bank and think how much i love you it's just because you're such a shy darling that you've been hesitating van's voice fell to a ca- ressing note that caused bill to clench his hands tightly he had sat in si- lence making no attempt to give warn- ing of his nearness from the first words he had frankly listened when young car- ter's footsteps re- ceded into the dis- tance for a moment there was no sound from the girl then bill's straining ears caught a long sigh- ing breath at the same instant the curtain swung inward revealing mar- tha seated tensely on one of the wood- en chairs close to the window impulsively he exclaimed don't do it she turned with a startled ejacula- tion her eyes widening with amaze- ment as they met his gaze instantly bill knew the enormity of what he had done but he was in for it now noth- ing to do but go ahead wait he exclaimed thrusting a hand into his pocket for some coins that he tossed on the table then he sprang lightly over the sill and reach- ing behind him drew down the win- dow she watched him with a baffling expression that made it harder to ex- plain i heard what you and van carter were saying he stated bluntly yes her voice was cold and it--it seemed to me-- he hesitated wishing she wouldn't look at him so fixedly what could he say he was thinking frantically couldn't tell her van wasn't any good i--hang it i think it's dreadful for you to be--to be hurried like that getting married is too--too serious to rush into it and --and a girl ought to consider what her father thinks bill could feel moist- ure trickling through his hair beading his forehead he had never been in so uncomfortable a spot you don't run a column in the newspaper do you she asked coolly offering advice to brides-to-be bill felt himself scorching beneath her steady gaze i did sound like a fool he said honestly but please believe me i'm sure you don't really want to be mar- ried like that you seemed so worried and unhappy i spoke before i could stop myself indeed she murmured flushing but it doesn't concern you maybe not bill said floundering on with characteristic tenacity but please mar--miss leeds go home to- day and think it over what's that it was amazing how harshly a smooth voice could speak at times neither bill nor the girl had been aware of van carter's approach he looked sharply from one to the other martha had again assumed the baffling expression we were just discussing a message to my father she said calmly what was it about your going home van insisted suspiciously add- ing as he shot bill an inimical look who are you i've seen you some place my name is bill avery was the reply old jase avery's boy van ex-  austin corcoran claimed thought you left this coun- try i did for a while bill said with forced calmness i've got to be going along martha said before carter could speak again coming van she nodded casually at bill as the two moved away martha obviously hurrying the pace bill gazed after them a meddler never done any good he reflected mor- osely i probably made her plumb set on marrying that coyote and she the swellest-looking girl and the smart- est i ever set my two eyes on kept her head just as cool as a frosty morn- ing didn't give me the least idea what she was thinking--nor him either managed things as slick as one of them magicians that pulls rabbits out of a hat and do i feel like a dumb rabbit --wow he went slowly to the street but neither martha nor van carter was in sight he considered going to the rail- road station but abandoned that idea while he was debating the best way to learn if the pair had left town by train he glimpsed a girl riding into the main road from the side street he knew led to the livery barn he couldn't be mis- taken in the pose of that head and shoulders that was martha heading for home she turned him down bill thought with a wave of that same exhilarating dizziness which had assailed him in the morning after first encountering her in the post office he wanted to emit a jubilant shout then his high spirits were deflated as he reflected that mar- tha had probably made her decision before he spoke and very likely she detested him for interfering in a strict- ly personal affair late that afternoon he dropped into samuel ordway's office the lawyer had just returned from the country and was shaking the dust from his coat when bill entered i saw parks and his wife he said with customary brevity they accept your offer of three thousand cash for the ranch make out the papers tomor- row good bill returned as briefly who is harve finley fellow running for sheriff in oppo- sition to lem carter's pet is finley in any trouble bill asked we-ell ordway replied cautious- ly there are rumors wouldn't sur- prise me if he does get into some could be framed and who is ben leeds bill went on with his questioning bought the arrowhead ranch coupla years ago takes sides with finley friends with lem no but carter would like to have van marry the leeds girl the arrow- head is about the only outfit carter hasn't been able to dig his claws into-- and martha leeds is her father's sole heir i see bill said thoughtfully she's a swell girl she's-- ordway halted eyeing bill suspiciously how do you know and van carter is a rat bill pro- ceeded ignoring the question he is ordway agreed also his father's main interest after land grab- bing and personal power lem's kind will lean backwards to keep within the law until they get in a panic he could slip a cog if he feared he was going to lose face in the community or if a pet scheme was about to be thwarted if your suspicions are true he won't want you around to remind him of that busi- ness with your father and if you-- if i should show interest in the girl van wants to marry bill put in cool- ly there might be--er--something in the line of fireworks the lawyer shrugged lean shoulders helplessly you were the nerviest kid i ever saw and you haven't changed a mite was his sole comment that night bill sent a telegram to his former employer that read every- think ok start ted with the cattle the first of the following week he poker winnings  took possession of the nate parks ranch which meant besides land and buildings a few head of fair saddle stock his purchase had aroused con- siderable attention around the country and ordway declared that carter had taken it hard though he was keeping amazingly quiet bill had seen neither the carters nor martha leeds his second morning on the ranch bill was repairing a corral gate when a horseman rode into the yard a com- pactly built man his iron grey hair was worn rather long and lay smoothly be- low his hat his closely shaven face was devoid of wrinkles and wore a bland expression good morning bill he said halt- ing near the corral howdy lem bill replied noncha- lantly you're lucky at your age to have cash enough to buy this place carter stated eyeing bill closely i worked hard for the stake but you haven't enough more to buy cattle lem suggested adding when bill said nothing and you either hope to raise some possibly at the bank or knowing my interest in this ranch you figured on tricking a still higher price out of me all right-- we'll settle the matter now i'm ex- panding considerably and can use this range and water i'll give you five hundred dollars more than you paid my reasons for buying are person- al bill replied staring into the black eyes that belied the blandness of the face this ranch positively is not for sale i'm here to stay i've made my only offer carter said curtly if your buy was on the level well--i hate to see a young fel- low start off with the handicap this un- stocked place will be and knowing how unfortunate your father was-- unfortunate is hardly the word i would use for what happened to my father bill broke in making a strong effort to conceal rising anger he had not foreseen how difficult it would be to face carter and restrain his suspi- cions when lem rode off after a few care- fully casual words bill was tensely on edge there must be some way of bringing this business to a head he thought never could play a waiting game rather risk everything on the cards i hold at the end of the week cattle were on bill's range and he had the companionship of a cowboy he had rid- den with for several years leaving ted rising in charge bill rode to town he wanted to see ordway and there was to be a horse sale that afternoon about a mile out of indian creek he saw a girl rider in front of him one look and he jabbed spurs into his horse when he slowed at her side martha gave him a serene glance and nod but the air held the disturbance of an electric current and he could not think of any ordinary comment to make it seemed that she was similarly af- fected for after a moment she startled bill by asking bluntly why were you so determined to stop me from going away with van carter that day w-why i--i told you the reasons he stammered those you stated were not sufficient to account for your extreme insist- ence she told him and since you interfered so inexcusably in my per- sonal affairs i consider you owe me at least an explanation she was looking squarely at him the intense color of her eyes adding to the disturbing mystery of their depths as before in her presence bill lost all pow- er to think i had to try to stop you he ex- claimed because i wanted to marry you myself oh the ejaculation was a gasp martha's serenity vanished and she blushed to the wave of soft hair below  austin corcoran her hat we're not even acquainted she said hastily didn't need to be he assured her the minute i saw you in the post of- fice that morning i let go all holds but those things i told you were all true he went on as far as they went there's no use martha i can't talk to you even a minute and try to hide what i think about you and i'll fight to the last second to keep you from marry- ing van carter--or anybody else the flush was subsiding but she evaded his eyes thanks for the hon- est reply she said attempting light- ness and you are excused from fur- ther explanations they were entering town and to bill's dismay before he could say any- thing further they had turned into the main street and met van face to face with a scowling glance at bill he wheeled in beside martha lucky break he said we'll put up the horses and go over-- sorry but i've got to go right on and meet dad she said coolly see you some other time but martha-- van began look she exclaimed someone's waving at you bill glanced at the sidewalk where an unusual number of people were grouped evidently attracted to town by the sale edna watson wearing an attractive riding outfit was standing at the side of the man from whom bill had rented the horse at the hanover barn the man had followed her eager glance and was scowling openly at van carter j d watson edna's father bill thought relishing van's chagrin but sorry for the girl whose eyes held such trust in him then martha was urging her horse ahead and he heard her softly utter  by bill the next minute a team and wagon came between them and van had dropped back ordway greeted bill with unusual eagerness heard from wellman he said pro- ducing a letter from his desk bill read the main paragraph aloud  i do recall the game because after the first round i lost steadily to the cat- tleman especially remember because i rode from town with him next morning to a tall red pinnacle rock where he turned off to pay a mortgage in full he told me what he had won made it pos- sible for he had only meant to take up half always considered that a happy loss guess that about settles it bill said with deep gravity only one red rock like that along any of the roads and it's where the trail heads off for carter's outfit a long way from bringing home anything to him i'm afraid ordway declared dubiously no bill said with quick decision the sale is about to start there's a gang gathered there i'm going to come right out in the open wait ordway shouted vainly as bill dashed from the room and down the stairway into the street the law- yer followed as fast as he could but by the time he had reached the open lot near the hotel bill was on the auction- eer's block and had the attention of the crowd many of you were my father's friends he said in a clear carrying voice some were our neighbors i know you will be glad with me that i can now prove that he did not gam- ble away the money which would keep us from dispossession the letter was read aloud accompanied by an explana- tion of its source what about them fellows saying jase avery lost his wad a voice de- manded from the crowd they were mistaken--or they had reason to make false statements bill replied every syllable audible to the farthest pair of ears all of you know that spike dober's bartender left this country ahead of a sheriff's posse a few dollars could have bought his testi- mony and sam ordway holds records that prove tod bixby served time in the pen for forging a check--with the name of lem carter's brother-in-law poker winnings  you knew that lem this question shot straight at the white face of the man addressed anybody with a hold on bixby could have given him or- ders to do or to say anything bill's steady gaze held the eyes of the crowd he saw van partly concealed by two broad-shouldered old cattlemen near the fringe of the onlookers and bill caught the gleam of savage fury in van's eyes as somebody demanded of bill what you trying to prove young fellow the truth you've all heard me and can do your own thinking bill re- plied adding only one more word my father's coat was torn off and lost in the flood anything in the nature of a receipt--or a canceled note--would have been lost damn you the frenzied shout was followed by a sharp explosion a bullet struck the post behind bill's head as he ducked and catapulted him- self through the jam of men van shot came a yell it was van young carter pulled trigger for a second time his face distorted to a mask of fury men sprang back as bill flung himself towards van stooping low then coming up in a terrific lunge hard fist striking carter on the chin while his other hand gripped the wrist above the forty-five van fought with the unleashed fury of insanity bill with the deadly purpose of a man who knows exactly what he is doing the impact of flesh on flesh the explosion of gunfire were followed by a cracking of bone as van's crushed wrist drooped and the forty-five fell to the ground sam ordway was shouting and the cold hard tones of the sheriff rang above the tumult get him boys that officer ordered lem too his tall sinewy figure strode toward the elder carter who stood as if frozen to the ground guess we don't need much more proof of the truth after van's break it was some time before bill could extricate himself from the crowd the tide of feeling against the carters surged higher and higher van's bro- ken words as he was led off to the jail were an even more complete betrayal of carter guilt and there were a dozen witnesses to attest to his attempt to shoot bill bill turned into a side street and walked slowly along trying to quiet his excitement and sort his thoughts quick light steps behind him were un- heeded until a soft call stopped him bill--wait martha came quickly to his side she caught his arm with both hands and looked up into his face you were splendid she exclaimed you should hear what people are saying the seriousness of bill's face yielded to a smile poker is a great game he said but let's forget that now i'm a lot more interested in what you think of my reason for taking a hand in your affairs dark eyelashes veiled her eyes we-ell she said slowly i might say i found it very interesting then bill kissed her couldn't have managed that if you had been looking at me he whispered your eyes are too dazzling and now let's go some place and talk things over how about getting our horses and riding out to your place we'll be all set to break the news to your father when he comes home oh martha murmured blushing deeply he's there now i only said that to get rid of van in the next issue buckaroo bounce by s omar barker man from blue river by  marian o'hearn sometimes it really does happen--a man and girl look at each other and know that this moment is what they've always waited for and if the girl is engaged to another man what then i the main street of law- rence was so crowded that the passing streams of people jostled each other and strangers walked shoulder to shoul- der the air was charged with carni- val but some of the faces in the crowd made faith byers afraid they were faces which belonged not to the range but to the back streets of cities pasty jowls and watchful furtive eyes what would happen when her fath- er who had mounted the steps of the newest and biggest saloon tried to talk to them she glanced at his slight fig- ure and serene old face and ran up the steps to his side dad it's not digni- fied for you to preach here a minister doesn't talk on the public streets anthony byers looked at her with gentle reproof i've explained faith people in this town won't come to church so i must go to them it's my duty but-- please and lifting his voice he called to the men and women on the sidewalk you must see the truth-- all of you this can be the greatest country in the world there is wealth at your feet and freedom if you want it but what's happening corrupt  illustration   marian o'hearn politicians rule the land not honest men you fight over whether there shall be territorial law or state gov- ernment but which of the two factions is honorable do you ask that aw quiet down a raucous voice bellowed shut him up boys let's dunk him in a barrel of beer half a dozen men wheeled out of the crowd and faith stepped in front of her father he has a right to speak she told them angrily you don't have to listen but you can't stop him confronted by the slim dark-haired girl they paused sheepishly but a wom- an at the rear of the crowd shrilled this town doesn't want any holy joes go get him once more the rush started and faith's lips went white she darted forward to meet the threatening men crying let him alone if you hurt him-- we won't hurt him we'll just give him a little lesson not this time brother the words rang through the uproar like the snap of a pistol hammer and a pony charged straight up the steps sending men leaping out of the way at the top the horseman wheeled widely and crowd- ed the last of the mob away from the elderly minister move back into the street the rider said and as he dropped to the ground the guns lifted from his holsters into his hands the crowd hesitated and there were a few indistinct sullen shouts but then people began to move again twin streams flowing past the saloon steps the man slid his guns into the hol- sters at his thighs and grinned his glance moving over faith they won't come back for a while he said but maybe you'd better give up the speech-making he was big and his faded clothes were covered with dust his skin was darkened by wind and sun into an al- most coppery brown but his hair was fair enough to catch the light and there was youngness on his face anthony byers said calmly i have to make speeches thank you for your help but these are my people and they must listen to me the gray eyes narrowed until they were as thin as the edge of minted coins you'd better not this town's kind of rough it's not only rough it's depraved there's no sense in staying in my church and preaching to empty pews people need me and i have to go where they can hear me if they're that stubborn why both- er with them let'em look after them- selves you're right faith broke in but dad thinks they don't know what they're doing he wants them to de- velop this country instead of letting political bosses rob them while they carouse his eyes touched hers held them their clear hardness was like a shock but then the metallic quality disap- peared or she imagined that it had imagined a boy's warm gaze was an- swering hers he said in a tone which she was to always remember my name's pat ransome ma'am i'm a stranger here just got down from my place way up in the blue river coun- try before faith could answer her father put out his hand i'm anthony byers and this is my daughter if you can't find a place to stay our home is open to you lawrence is so crowded you may need a bed thank you sir ransome hesi- tated over the words and his gaze went back to the girl i'll probably stay at the great western hotel meeting a friend of mine he paused and then added maybe you know him--tom knox he's been in lawrence for some years faith's blue eyes sharpened against his face and she told herself of course he would be a friend of knox's he would have to be but there was a sharp almost stunned second of loss as if something precious had been torn man from blue river  from her hands just as she tried to grasp it her father straightened and his face chilled we've met mr knox good day and taking faith's arm he start- ed hurriedly down the steps wait a minute ma'am ransome's voice was low and his hand lifted as if to touch her it dropped at once but she remembered that too remembered the shape and strength of his lifted hand maybe you'd better tell me how tom knox stands with you i'd guess you don't care much for him faith did not want to meet his eyes but her glance lifting against her will was caught by his caught in a com- mand which was like hands holding her her father said we know very lit- tle of him and couldn't tell you any- thing important good day young man ransome stepped back so that they could pass but faith knew that his gaze was following her and at the bottom of the steps she glanced back he was standing motionless looking after them and his eyes were like new-mint- ed coins anthony byers murmured i'm sor- ry he's one of knox's pals we'll for- get about it yes but she was wondering at her feeling of loss that man pat ran- some had been like an answer for which she was waiting ii all of the territory knew about knox who had fought his way up through dishonest petty politics to ruthless power he had been involved in every kind of land and mining graft and when accused laughingly admit- ted the facts insisting that everyone in the country was trying to do the same thing so strongly entrenched that not even an open admission of guilt could harm him he controlled the local government by filling every pub- lic office with his hirelings he re- ceived revenue from every bar gam- bling hall and dive in lawrence still the girl said suddenly if ransome's a stranger here-- the roar of a gun cut through her words and even as she whirled people were running for cover the gun barked again and the street was empty --except for pat ransome his wea- pons had flipped in that swift deadly dance into his hands and there was a dark blotch on the sleeve of his shirt he had been shot blood dripped from his hand but he was facing a side street which met the main thoroughfare directly in front of the saloon and his guns were leveling carefully faith saw the other man then he was clinging to the shelter of a wall as he slid away both ransome's weapons spoke and the man went down still pressing against the brown brick wall ransome waited erect and motion- less the last of the sunlight raying over his fair head and faith's breath caught in her dry mouth and she told herself his eyes look like that again --like the edges of a coin he stirred finally and walked toward the mound which had been a man the movement aroused anthony byers from his shock and he ran across the street faith followed and when she reached them her father was kneeling beside the still figure ransome was staring down at the dead man and his face was almost calm you've--killed him she said be- cause she had to say something had to break the terrible stillness he looked at her but his eyes did not see her yeah he would have killed me if i hadn't she was silent and his glance flicked oddly over her face i'll tell the sher- iff about it he said sorry you had to be here as he turned away a man with a small bag in his hand crossed the street and said matter-of-factly better let me look at your arm gunshot wounds can cause trouble it was mike har-  marian o'hearn vey one of the two physicians in law- rence thanks but not now i'll see you later it's not bad and ransome went on at that swift even pace harvey swung around and seeing faith started angrily toward her what's the idea of standing out in the street with a shooting match going on it was over before i knew it had happened she said and her glance fol- lowed pat ransome the young doctor shifted his bag and pulled her arm through his he glared at her father she might have been killed why didn't you get her out of the way anthony byers smiled i've never managed to make her accept orders that's why i don't try to give em you'd both better go home har- vey snapped we'll take this carriage at the corner he helped faith and her father up and sitting at the girl's side looked at her grimly i thought you promised not to have any part in this street preaching promised her blue glance lifted to his face i don't think i said any- thing mike you just told me but you knew i took it for granted anthony byers laughed drily which shows that doctors know less about women than ministers never take anything concerning them for granted faith smiled at harvey she had known him for almost two years ever since she and her father arrived in law- rence and she knew that some day when she was really ready she would marry him he was everything she wanted in a husband good-looking capable and hard-working until she met him she had not known that a man could be so gentle and yet completely strong he touched her hand make the promise now--then i'll only worry about you part of the time but i can't let dad go out alone he might be killed today-- but she stopped suddenly not wanting to tell mike about pat ransome what happened today anthony byers spoke quickly i started to talk in front of the oasis bar and some toughs threatened me a young fellow--probably a gunnie himself--stopped them someone shot him a minute after we left the man who wouldn't let me take care of his arm harvey's voice was startled and his hazel glance touched faith he didn't look like a gunnie to me fire beat up into the girl's cheeks and her blue eyes darkened he must be he's a friend of tom knox harvey's glance still on her face be- came intent and her hand lifted to her throat where an angry pulse was beat- ing against the flesh but he did not speak until they reached the parson- age where he said i think we'd bet- ter have a talk the color in her cheeks became even more fiercely bright mike pat ran- some's a stranger in lawrence yet someone tried to shoot him why would anyone want to kill a stranger there might be reasons i heard that tom knox was bringing in a man to run for the legislature the nom- ination's all set and knox's friends al- ways win the elections oh the glow in her face faded and once more she knew that sense of loss would the state party resort to murder might not have been the state par- ty--just someone who didn't want knox's man to be nominated he's al- ways careful about the people he brings in to run for office they're invariably strangers with clean records at least as far as anyone in the territory knows that's playing it safe a clean record she murmured have you ever seen a freshly minted coin that's what-- faith harvey's hand closed on her arm and he drew her toward the house i don't give a damn about this man from blue river  man ransome i want to talk about us your father's gone inside so we'll sit on the porch he put her onto the porch couch and sat beside her this latest idea of preaching sermons on the street is cra- zy i can't keep my mind on my work because i'm always wondering if you're in trouble but you know-- let me finish he took her hands in his firm strong ones why don't you marry me so i can really look after you this isn't a woman's country and girls like you can get hurt faith went very still so still that even her breath paused mike was ask- ing her to marry him just as she had dreamed he was waiting so close that she could see the line of his mouth and the healthy grain of his skin for months she had thought of this mo- ment but now that it had come some- thing was missing something which had to be between them is that the only reason why you want to marry me so you can look after me his head lifted and his eyes grew sharp well he murmured you can play the coquette too i didn't believe it she flushed and stopped searching for the magic the moment should have had perhaps every woman can--at times she said and thought of pat ransome with his narrowed searching eyes would he ask a girl to marry him so that he might look after her or would it be only because he couldn't live without her sorry darling mike murmured i shouldn't have said that i can make pretty speeches too then make some no there are better ways and his head bent over hers he claimed her lips with the tenderness which was part of him a tenderness that was ines- capable and yet could never be soft- ness but when he released her there were stinging tears in her eyes what mike whom she had hoped to marry was of- fering wasn't enough she was seeing pat ransome's face remembering him as he had stood in the light looking after her he had come to lawrence so that knox's thievery and graft could control another public office--yet he was making her forget the touch of mike's lips faith harvey said softly i'm leaving guess i muffed things this time no--wait she got up and her hands clung to him you didn't muff anything he put his fingers under her chin and tilted her face up to his sure he asked huskily you've got to be sure instead of answering she lifted her mouth and a moment later whispered no one could ever find a better hus- band than you'll be he laughed and pushed her gently away from him hold that theory lady just now i've got work to do by the time i get back there'll probably be a few more gunshot cases iii faith was finishing the supper dishes when she heard her father leave his study and go softly along the hall to the front door she raced out of the kitch- en calling where are you going to make this town listen to me you didn't think i'd give up please don't you'll be hurt that's not important realizing that she could not stop him she turned swiftly toward her own room saying then i'll go with you as soon as i get a wrap he nodded absently and waited for her to join him for the short walk to the business district but as they ap- proached the great western hotel they were almost forced off the side- walk by the surging reckless crowd looks as if tom knox is holding open house byers said grimly i suppose  marian o'hearn his political gang is in town to look over the nominee the boys have great times on the taxpayer's money the space in front of the hotel was almost impassable for hundreds of men had wedged themselves into the street to stare at the office holders as faith and her father neared the doors the crowd thrust back to make an opening for a group of men emerging from the hotel they were shouting with laugh- ter and one of them pausing on the steps called to the crowd you know old judge foster boys well we just found out he tried to kiss one of the hotel chambermaids this morning we're giving him a trial by kangaroo court all we need is the accusing wit- ness won't find any witnesses this time of the night someone shouted back the women in this town stay inside after dark the merry roisterer on the steps of the hotel made a large gesture find someone got to be girls around he paused stared down at faith and then roared there's one bring her in she can accuse the judge make it good girlie make it hot he'll have a time tonight the politicians companions charged down the steps and faith's father pushed her behind him are you all crazy he demanded not even tom knox's hired men would do this ah get out of the way we're not going to harm her one of them swept the girl off her feet and when anthony byers tried to stop him shoved the old minister back against the crowd faith tried to twist free and failing struck wildly at the man's face but he changed his grip so as to hold down her arms and continued with much laughter up into the lobby there was a roar of amusement as he staggered across the lobby carrying the struggling girl and someone pushed open the doors to the main floor ban- quet room here's our witness he set her down in a room thick with smoke and filled with half-drunken men get the trial going gentlemen we'll see whether judge foster can insult the womanhood of lawrence faith put her hands on the back of a chair to steady herself and drew a long careful breath somehow she would hold back the blazing anger which made her want to strike out at the men around her the man at the head of the table was a big once-powerful figure with an old young face his jaw was soft with wadded fat and too much flesh drooped down over his small dark eyes tom knox the political boss of lawrence who was said to steal a million dollars a year from the taxpayers and make them like it was grinning with delight as he gestured toward faith with a cigar held between pudgy fingers someone was ploughing toward him --and then faith saw that it was pat ransome his eyes were like no color she had ever seen and his coppery bronze skin was white the long nar- row banquet table was directly in front of him and he leaped over it as he made for the girl's captor she heard the ugly thud of flesh against bone as his fists struck and a man roared for god's sake pat stop stop ransome's hands were on the other's throat and his face was that of a sav- age the sight of him sent a sick hor- ror surging through the girl but to her own surprise she ran toward him you'd better let him go she said and her high thin words cut through the din you're one of tom knox's paid politicians too these are your own kind his eyes lifted and color began to creep back into his face he released the feebly struggling man and let him fall to the floor where's your father he asked through stiff barely moving lips outside she was already running for the door they may have killed him by this time the crowd in front of the hotel broke apart and she saw a group of men gath- man from blue river  ered around something on the walk dad she cried anthony byers face was bloodless and his body seemed curiously crum- pled but before she could touch him pat ransome lifted her to her feet i'll look after him he's probably just knocked out he swung around to the nearest man get a doctor-- fast there's one named harvey down the street tell him we're taking mr byers home he lifted the minister's slight body and opened the door of a carriage which had drawn up to the curb plac- ing the old man carefully on the back seat he said he's not badly hurt he'll be all right you're not leaving now the odd gray glance flickered no he said softly i'm taking you home the doctor ought to be there almost as soon as we are the doctor was mike faith with her father's head pillowed in her lap wondered why she could not call up a picture of his face if she could visual- ize the strength of his mouth and the kindness of his eyes she would remem- ber other things too the carriage crawled to a halt in front of the house and ransome carried the minister in she hurried ahead to show him the way and the door-knock- er banged faith mike harvey's voice came from the hall in here it's dad she started out to him only to stop and look up at the man at her side something moved in his eyes but in- stead of speaking he turned out of the room and when she followed he and mike harvey were facing each other silently hurry she cried dad was knocked down and hurt mike walked into the bedroom i'll want your help faith his tones were cool and clipped his eyes impersonal as he bent over her father she said nervously pat ransome was there at the hotel when we-- not now mike interrupted you can tell me about it later her head jerked up and her eyes widened against his face but he was not looking at her nor was he aware of her why is he unconscious so long she whispered shock i'll bring him out of it but he'll have to stay in bed for a few days he pulled the pillow from un- der anthony byers head and took a phial from his bag as he held it to the minister's lips he said you can go out now i'll undress him once more faith's eyes widened as she looked at the young physician was this the answer was the magic miss- ing from his caresses because no wom- an could ever have all of him he was a stranger now a cool detached stranger conscious only of the doctor's eternal struggle with life and death what of it she asked herself an- grily even part of him is enough-- and maybe no man ever gives all of himself iv ransome was wait- ing in the hall stand- ing straight and erect and still just as he had stood while her father prayed beside the man he had shot how is he still unconscious but the doctor says he'll be all right he's suffering from shock he nodded and was silent as if wait- ing for her to go on when she did not speak he said there's something i'd like to tell you but we'd better not talk here why-- but her words stopped and she moved uneasily past him to the living room he came in slowly his gray glance knifing over the room taking in every- thing in it when she sat down he pulled a chair directly before her i want to explain about tom knox  marian o'hearn he said i knew him a long time ago when we were kids in texas i worked for the same outfit and we covered a lot of trails together he left years ago and i didn't know where he was when i came to the territory to start a spread in the blue river country a week ago an hombre showed up at my spade ranch and said tom need- ed me here in lawrence i came--be- cause i'd have expected him to come if i'd sent for him but i wasn't ready for what i found knox isn't the man i used to know he doesn't even look the same after i get him straightened out on what his gang pulled tonight i'm heading back to the blue river country his coppery bronzed face was almost tense but his gaze was that of a boy young and warm or perhaps she was imagining that because his eyes seemed to command her to say disturbing soundless words then you've probably found out what tom knox means to lawrence he and his crowd are turning it into the most corrupt dishonest town in the west the thin look about his mouth be- came more marked if the people of the territory wanted honest govern- ment they'd force the politicians to give it to them so i'm not worried about that then why did you want me to know about your friendship with knox the light which had made his eyes young suddenly flared high because you're you when i go back to the blue river country i want you to go with me color raced up her throat and re- ceded so swiftly that her face was pa- per white she started to her feet then sat down again almost helplessly he had held her as much as if he had put his hands on her i don't know what you mean she said the words almost whispering through her dry lips i don't know you we only saw each other a little while ago we've always known each other at least i've always known you may- be i've been waiting for you i've heard it happened that way but i didn't be- lieve it until now faith he was bending over her and the light which had moved in his eyes was also glowing behind the flesh of his face she shook her head trying to find words to stop him struggling to say that he must not touch her but his hands were already on her drawing her toward him and his mouth was crush- ing down on hers she could never remember all of that kiss which stretched over an endless second she only knew that his lips sent a savage song into her blood a wild rhythm which was hard as his eyes and his arms she had hunted for an elusive magic with mike harvey and had not found it was this that magic no it was wilder and deeper something she could never forget nor escape now that she had known it his arms loosened and she felt him straighten he lifted his head and looked toward the door there was someone there  mike har- vey she turned unsteadily and felt pat's quick supporting hand on her arm she did not speak but she and mike looked at each other across the length of the room finally he made an odd gesture and put his bag down on a table maybe he said and his voice sounded weary i'd better talk to you alone ran- some pat's hand left faith's arm and she heard him say you can talk to me any time--but is there any special rea- son to do it now i'm afraid there is miss byers is my fiancée ransome did not speak and faith facing mike wondered how many min- utes were dragging by in a stillness which grew sharper than a scream she wet her dry lips and put her hand against the hard pulse in her throat be- fore she was able to turn his eyes man from blue river  looked down at her almost calmly and they were the gray of minted coin then his glance went back to harvey seems to have been a misunder- standing doc you needn't bother to do any talking it's all said adios and good night to you ma'am he walked past her to the door mov- ing evenly and surely his face seemed darker than ever and his hair more bril- liantly fair pat the word burst from her lips where are you going he paused and looked back to see about getting nominated to the terri- torial legislature faith listened to pat ransome's foot- steps going down the hall heard the closing of the front door only then did she turn back to mike harvey and he said quickly your father's con- scious but i want him to sleep thank you she sat down and waited as he crossed the room to her you shouldn't have done that he said quietly he's not a man to play with and i don't think he's the kind who plays himself maybe i don't understand mike smiled wryly it's simple enough and don't look like that i guess i knew this afternoon that you weren't for me she made herself meet his eyes what are you telling me just that our engagement's ended his face no longer looked drawn but there was a new crookedness at the corners of his mouth would you let me go like this so easily mike listen to me pat ran- some's a stranger i don't know why i kissed him or why i wanted to but it's over now and it has nothing to do with us with what we might have the crooked grin deepened i'm afraid it has a lot to do with us i wouldn't have told ransome you'd promised to marry me except that he isn't for you either he's not your kind and you wouldn't like being mar- ried to one of tom knox's hired hands they're worse than professional gun- men because a gunnie can only ruin a few lives -- they destroy thousands that means you decided then as soon as you saw us together-- i decided you shouldn't be engaged to anyone until you've grown up he took his bag from the table i'll be around in the morning mike wait she went to him quickly her hands lifting in appeal i wish it hadn't happened you have to believe that please kiss me good night so that i'll know-- so you'll know i still want to hold you in my arms she stopped and stared at him with darkening eyes is that what you think of me he turned to the door good night faith he said crisply and he too moved quietly down the hall and out of the house it was a long time before she went to her own room and got into bed knowing she would not sleep the dark- ness was a curtain on which played vivid pictures of pat ransome and it also showed her mike harvey smiling drily to hide the tenderness of his mouth at dawn she got up and pulling on her clothes went to her father's room finding him asleep she started a fire in the kitchen range and began to prepare breakfast the sun would be up soon and pat ransome would be moving about in the sunlight apart from her and out of her life as she measured coffee into the pot there was a sound like a soft footstep on the back porch she listened the spoon in mid- air had she actually heard the door opening it couldn't be but it was it swung in slowly and a man stepped into the kitchen tom knox the political boss of lawrence he looked at her with his appraising heavy-lidded dark eyes and said good morning ma'am i saw a light and figured you were awake how's your father i heard he was roughed up a bit last night yes your men did the roughing  marian o'hearn i'm sorry about that and the boys'll pay for it too mind if i sit down he pulled out a kitchen chair as much at ease as if before dawn calls were a frequent occurrence heard pat ransome was here last night that he brought your father home after he was hurt faith was silent watching his un- naturally heavy face with the folds of soft flesh beneath a chin which should have been hard ransome got plenty excited when that crazy fool dragged you in off the street as a witness in his kangeroo court the man didn't mean any real harm and it wouldn't have happened if he hadn't been drunk that didn't make it any pleasanter still i'd hate to think it would cause serious trouble for ransome how could it cause trouble for him knox shrugged his thick shoulders he seems to have gotten ideas may- be he got them after talking to you late last night he showed up in front of the great western hotel and made a wild-eyed speech wanted the peo- ple of lawrence to drive me out of the territory knox paused and chuckled softly and i brought him here any- how he told the crowd that he was going to run for the nomination--in- dependently independently that's funny isn't it ma'am as if anybody could get elected like that in this coun- try the thickly enfolded eyes were un- smiling and watchful but faith was no longer seeing them pat ransome hadn't become a political puppet in- stead he was going to fight knox if he could get the people behind him   too bad knox broke in and his voice held that thick laughter it wouldn't work just couldn't ma'am suppose the people of this district were crazy enough to line up behind a man without any political connec- tions what'd happen maybe there would be honest gov- ernment depends on how you look at those things but if ransome got too many people on his side it wouldn't be nice --because he wouldn't live long the slow casual words sent ice into the girl's veins and the man's dark eyes told her that he meant exactly what he had said ransome had been his friend but he would die if he tried to stand in knox's way she stepped back uncomfortably why are you telling me this maybe you ought to tell pat ransome i'll do that too but he's a stubborn hombre thought maybe you could make him listen why i never saw him until yes- terday and i don't expect to see him again no knox murmured that's too bad he acted pretty interested but maybe he doesn't know about young doc harvey he got up and started for the door letting his words trail after him but with his hand on the knob he went on ransome's an explosive jasper you saw that last night he would have killed someone if he hadn't been stopped might not be safe for the doc if pat found out wait a minute mr knox i don't like what you've said and you had no right to come here don't do it again i won't ma'am but remember about ransome he plays for keeps the door snapped closed but she heard him chuckle as he went down the steps v when faith took a breakfast tray into her father's room at eight o'clock she was dressed for the street and the sick man smiled i like that outfit he murmured but isn't it a bit fancy for doing housework i'm going out if you're well enough to be alone for a while man from blue river  of course i'm well enough can't you wait for young harvey to get here it's still early faith attempted to smile but her lips twisted and she turned away i'm not going to see mike dad-- she glanced at her reflection in the mirror--do you really like this dress of course but she did not hear him for she was trying to see herself through a man's eyes through pat ransome's eyes the dove-gray frock hugged her slim waist and the full graceful skirt was so long that only the tips of her slippers showed a spray of rose-pink plume dipped over the side of the matching gray bonnet and rested against her black curls she was glad that her hair was so dark because it made her skin seem very fair her eyes were good too deep blue and just large enough faith stop mooning i hate to see a girl admire herself i wasn't--that is i'm not sure about this dress now i'm going to leave you for a few minutes mike will be in later she hurried out in the warm sunlight and started for the great western hotel through streets as crowded as they had been the night before but today the mood of the crowd was dif- ferent groups of men and women talked in undertones and others moved quietly toward the main thoroughfare which was lined with hastily made ban- ners the largest banner fluttered over a building opposite the great western hotel where workmen were erecting a platform the breeze caught the home- made pennant and shook it out in front of the girl's eyes clean up law- rence it read nominate pat ran- some dozens of other signs shrieked tom knox's machine is through pat ransome will represent the peo- ple not the office holders warmth stirred through faith it was really happening he was actu- ally defying knox and apparently the people of lawrence were determined to support him the lobby of the great western was almost empty and the clerk said mr ransome's no longer here you'll find him across the street in that building where they're putting up the stand as she reached the entrance of the shabby office building pat appeared in the doorway i saw you coming he said is there anything i can do for you ye-es i'd like to talk to you he hesitated and the corners of his lips moved of course ma'am come in he led the way into what had once been a store and pulled out an ancient chair we haven't much of a political headquarters i don't want to sit down i have to tell you something if it's about last night please don't i've forgotten it she stiffened and anger flickered through her did he think she had come here to beg if he hadn't known the truth when he held her in his arms    have you really forgotten she asked making her voice light his glance was a cold touch on her face yes ma'am she smiled deliberately and her growing anger flung scarlet banners into her cheeks in that case you shouldn't have told me it's not polite to tell any woman you could ever for- get her his mouth clamped into a thin line you said you had something to tell me i have in that half-edged half- flirtatious tone but first i'd like to be sure because you see--i haven't for- gotten you his eyes blazed fire burning through their chill in that case he said his words a thin drawl i under- stand your being here he moved toward her almost calmly and took her into his arms laughing when she tried to escape i should have told you i play for  marian o'hearn keeps and he kissed her with hard lips she shivered and wanted to sob no wild dangerous sweetness in this just anger and fierce challenge the kind of kiss no man should know about she drove her small clenched fists against his chest and broke away from him but his face was quiet and his eyes unreadable i shouldn't have done that and you shouldn't have come here to make me do it she tore her glance free and started for the door hoping he would not see the tears that were burning into her eyes but as she remembered she stopped and made herself face him tom knox came to see me this morn- ing he said that if you win the nom- ination you'll be killed ransome grinned you needn't have told me that ma'am but thanks just the same i figure knox's crowd will do anything to protect themselves so i'm ready for a little lead-throw- ing he controls this country he can give orders to thousands of men he's filled every office with people who obey him if he orders them to kill you-- they'll try to do it but i don't in- tend to let them thanks again ma'am he made the last words an ending but she could not go instead she re- mained at the door looking at him feeling all of her pride being stripped away from her i didn't come here to--to make you kiss me she said her voice a low cry and last night-- his face closed and his eyes did not seem to see her i told you last night never happened ma'am i'd rather re- member this morning then it won't be important faith felt the breath stop in her throat and fire poured over her face as if his hard palm had cracked against her cheek she jerked blindly at the door and plunging through it found herself caught in a crush of men mill- ing about the entrance to the building curious onlookers were mingled with the workers and with the soft-faced sharp-eyed adherents of tom knox she got through at last and turning toward home had to force herself not to run she would not sob not now or ever instead she would always re- call pat ransome's insolent stinging words faith mike harvey's voice stopped her as she saw his face fear struck at her what is it she cried have you seen dad yes i just came from your house your father's fine but something's happened he hesitated i've got to ask you a question i don't like did pat ran- some go back to see you after i left last night go back to see me-- she did not understand even as she repeated the words but then her eyes turned very blue and some of the girlishness left her face i'm sorry mike that wouldn't have hurt so much if it had come from anyone else listen his hand closed impa- tiently on her arm you know me too well to think i'd get nasty i've just got to know--because of something i heard are you serious what did you hear pat didn't come back but even if he had-- i'm afraid you don't understand what such a story means when it's told by the man involved--in a town like this but it couldn't have-- she stopped and her voice trailed off into a thin high sound told by the man in- volved  oh no she said her tone once more firm and steady and her breath more even mike's face tightened i'll drop in tonight better get home and look after your father where are you going instead of answering he moved swiftly away toward the main street she watched him for a moment and something in the set of his shoulders man from blue river  the carriage of his head frightened her mike wait he did not turn or pause and she ran after him if he went to pat ransome with whatever story had been repeated to him but who could have thought of such an ugly little tale only a few people knew that she had met ransome but one of those people was tom knox harvey turned into the main street and when she reached the corner he had disappeared the crowds got in her way and the street before ransome's headquarters was almost impassable but finally she worked her way to the doors and asked the nearest man is dr harvey here yeah just came a few minutes ago a gun crashed from inside the build- ing and the crowd broke in panic those who had been jamming the en- trance disappeared in a wild rush for safety faith her legs suddenly un- steady stumbled toward the door of ransome's campaign office when she got it open she saw mike harvey lying on the floor pat ransome was stand- ing against the opposite wall staring at the shattered window and there was a gun in his hand without looking at her he said take care of him call that other doctor and he sprang past her out of the room vi faith knew as soon as she knelt beside mike harvey that he was dying the floor was stained with blood seeping from his chest and he was breathing in hard choking gasps she began to call shril- ly for help but the men who had run for cover were already streaming into the room get dr adair she cried hurry she looked around wildly for help someone's already gone for him a man grunted and staring down at mike he added looks like this fin- ishes our reform government before it got started ransom'll be elected to a noose out of the way a voice snapped let the doctor in they shuffled back and white-haired dr adair bent over mike fix up some kind of stretcher he said take him to my place i'll have to operate then he's-- faith's voice broke he's dying i don't know he's in bad shape please leave young lady you shouldn't be here someone led her to the door and then the sunlight was spilling hotly over her as she walked along the rough side- walk mike was dying    and pat ransome he had not looked at her or noticed her when she found him standing over harvey with a gun in his hand if he had shot in self-defense    but mike never carried a gun her steps slowed sharply and part of the weight which had crushed down on her when she saw mike lying on the floor of pat's office disappeared why of course she told herself speaking aloud tom knox did this that's what he meant this morning if his gang had killed pat it might have ruined him politically but this way is safe ransome will be tried for mur- der she went on again more lightly there was some way that she could make the truth known not to anyone in lawrence where every official took orders from tom knox but she would get word to washington would go there if necessary the house seemed very quiet as she entered but passing the door of the liv- ing room she jerked to a halt a man was turning away from the windows moving toward her a tall man whose eyes were the color of gray minted metal she stepped into the room and closed the door mike harvey may be dying and everyone believes you shot him yeah the expression of his face did not change i figured on that what are you going to do  marian o'hearn several things but i couldn't leave without seeing you you're leaving and then before he could answer she rushed on why did you have to see me he hesitated had his eyes really changed were they clear and young or was she once more imagining that because i want you to know what i said this morning wasn't true i don't want to forget you i can't i'll al- ways remember faith and wish i'd found you sooner she felt the blood leaving her face and even her lips turning cold this was good-by he was leaving getting out of the territory before the law could catch up with him and he had not denied shooting harvey you can't go she said her words just above a whisper i have to for a lot of reasons you're the biggest one it wasn't your fault that i didn't know about harvey i didn't give you time to tell me i saw you and thought-- he broke off and once more the corners of his mouth moved into a faint wry smile what did you think she moved closer to him watching his face guess i thought we belonged to- gether--something simple like that it wasn't simple she could not keep back the words maybe it was right pat maybe that's how it should be with everyone yeah except that it never is adios ma'am he put out his hand and she placed hers in it but then she was in his arms which were holding her fierce- ly against him his lips were fiery music on her mouth and her racing blood took up the song of his kiss yes it was also magic the magic she had sought when he let her go she whispered no we were meant to be together wait he shook his head and there was no youngness or warmth in his eyes i told you i'd always remember but the trouble is i can't forget any part of it-- especially harvey faith's father remaining unwill- ingly in bed asked for mike half a dozen times that day i'll make him realize i'm well enough to be up send word to him please but anthony byers still looked so white and ill that faith would not tell him the truth instead she said mike was too busy to look in on him and in- sisted on his staying in his room evening arrived too slowly and twi- light stretched over long-drawn-out hours during which she kept hearing pat ransome's voice saying i can't forget any of it--especially harvey while she was having a lonely sup- per in the kitchen a boy arrived with a message from dr adair saying that mike was conscious and asking for her she went at once hurrying along the narrow unlighted street to adair's big frame home the elderly doctor an- swered the door and told her smiling- ly  looks as if we'll get him through he led the way to a room at the rear of the house and as he opened the door his pleasant-faced wife got up from her place at the bedside he's sleeping again she whispered miss byers had better wait she can sit here with him they went out and faith took the chair near mike's bed in sleep his face looked younger and less grave touchingly unguarded why couldn't she have loved him or have given him all of her love maybe he had part of it and maybe that part would always belong to him    there was a sound behind her the door swung in and pat ransome en- tered the room how did you get here i thought-- is he conscious he asked ignor- ing her question i was hoping he would be the man on the bed stirred restless- ly and then his eyes opened he looked at faith before his glance went to pat glad you're here ransome come closer so i won't have to shout pat went to the bed and mike said swiftly want to tell you while i can man from blue river  --you've got to get away send faith out of the room for a minute why-- the girl began but then she got up and walked out to the hall shutting the door behind her pat came out a moment later and she demanded what did he say does he think you shot him ransome's glance was odd remote and almost cold no he wants me to get out of the country maybe i'll take his advice and as soon as the last word was spoken he walked past her down the hall toward the rear of the house as he disappeared into the kitchen she realized that he had entered the same way she opened the bedroom door but mike harvey was asleep and for a mo- ment she looked down at him in be- wilderment which was mixed with anger he had sent for her but had been more interested in talking to pat ransome almost as if they had joined forces against her dr adair glanced in and said this has been enough of a visit for him miss byers he's very weak he ushered her out the front door and when it closed behind her she felt lonely and shut away from life a group of horsemen were pounding down the street and at their head was a deputy sheriff a posse starting the hunt for pat ransome probably he had been seen near dr adair's house and the lawmen knew he could not be far ahead of them if they caught him    another line of riders was approach- ing but these were moving at a walk four men heavily armed with holsters mounted on their saddles they reined in ahead of faith and two of them dropped to the ground are you miss byers the first rider asked ye-es that's what i thought his heavy- set body swayed forward one hand clamped over her mouth and the other arm lifted her from her feet vii before she could be- gin to struggle she was put onto his pony and he stepped up be- hind her digging in his spurs the three other men closed in around them and they pounded down the road traveling north within fifteen minutes they had left lawrence behind and were enter- ing a trail which led to the back hills how is it the man holding faith shouted to a rider behind him clear he took his hand from the girl's mouth there's no use yelling or fighting sister we're not going to hurt you but you can't get away so don't try it where are you taking me why-- you'll find out later just keep still and you'll be more comfortable he sent his mount into an even faster pace and they roared toward the first dim outline of the hills but a mile below they reined in and waited at the side of the trail no one spoke until the thud of hoofs broke the stillness and a man rode out of the brush mac he called yeah all here he rode up to them then and faith saw that it was tom knox you're responsible for this she told him you-- hold it ma'am he said easily there's nothing for you to be afraid of and nobody's going to hurt you i'm taking you to a nice comfortable cabin where you'll be all right for a few days why what's this about if you expect my father to pay you-- he chuckled you ought to guess the reason pat ransome's disappeared and he's smart enough to get away from ten posses but if he hears you've been kidnaped--and he will because he's got plenty of friends--he'll come back i know him when he comes  marian 'hearn back he'll walk right into the strong arms of the law after that-- he let his words fade into another chuckle after that you'll see he's sent to jail for shooting dr harvey but mike harvey's not going to die that'll make it harder for you won't it maybe but accidents can happen people might get so worked up they'd take ransome out of jail and lynch him even if the doc doesn't die this town thinks a lot of young harvey she stared at him in amazed dis- belief he was so sure of himself so conceited about his own power that he was coolly explaining how he in- tended to cause another man's death when she was silent he told the men we'll get going couple of hours of traveling ahead they started on--only to pull in again at once their hands jerking wild- ly at the reins a tall figure was standing directly ahead of them on the trail covering them with two leveled guns and in spite of the darkness faith knew that it was pat ransome all right tom he called to knox drop your guns and get down quiet- like i've got that scared little killer you sent to get harvey back there in the brush he's all tied up and safe and he's been talking plenty i caught him an hour after the shooting dumb to throw lead through a window knox did not speak and the men around him tensed their hands moving toward their weapons ransome said don't go for your irons boys if you do i'll let knox have it first better tell em tom pat you're crazy we've always been friends so let's talk this over knox's voice was actually friendly but suddenly even as he was speaking he flipped out his own weapon it ex- ploded with a roar both ransome guns barked at the same moment and knox went limp for a second he was a grotesque soft shape on top of his horse then he slid sidewise out of the saddle the riders remained motionless their hands still near their guns come on then pat told them soft- ly start throwing that lead and you won't have to worry about the law the man on the lead pony muttered he'll get at least one of us and he's right we're through let's pull out the second man growled there's no stake in this for us now the rider who had been holding faith in the saddle before him stepped down and lifted her to the ground then he got up again hastily and wheeled his mount the others fol- lowed driving their ponies to top speed and suddenly the girl sagged they were gone--and she was free pat she said weakly i think i'm going to faint i never have before but this must be the way it feels no you're not he reached her in two strides and caught her arms hold on to yourself do you hear ye-es she swayed against him and his arms closed around her feel better he asked a little but don't let me go to her surprise he laughed she straightened up forgetting her faint- ness to look at his face this hasn't been a very funny experience i was laughing at the idea of let- ting you go--because i never will she started to speak but he stopped her words with his lips and even now in the middle of the dark deserted prairie his mouth was touched with the thing she had sought the magic she had almost missed but at the end of that kiss she said then you won't remember mike you see he broke our engagement i know he told me yesterday he realizes things like this can happen and he said you belong with me he said that she drew out of his arms i'm so glad you and he ar- ranged everything it was sweet of him to give his consent and-- shut up he said and kissed her again love is the loot by  cliff walters things were so mixed up in rim valley and in eileen clark's head that it was pretty hard to tell friend from foe    though she woke up just in time having struggled through her first year of school teaching on stormy slope in a ramshackle log build- ing afflicted with a leaky roof and winter drafts eileen clark was grateful when her uncle frosty clark had invited her to make her home at the jy a hundred miles to the south in rim valley yet in spite of the month she had been here she felt that she hardly knew this uncle this squat-built blunt man with the chill blue eyes on this evening frosty clark stood on the ranch house porch and watched intently a pair of riders coming down the valley   cliff walters old jim got him all right said frosty and nodded not without satis- faction toward the sheriff jim bar- clay who was bringing an elderly pris- oner downstream eileen's clear brown eyes held to the oncoming horseman she looked at the elderly sheriff tall erect rather pic- turesque in his saddle then her gaze focused on the prisoner a stooped elderly shaggy-haired man whose feet were encased in ill-made moccasins eileen said to her uncle fortune seems to have followed you into this valley you were able to buy out three homesteaders and consolidate that land into a very fine ranch and here's moccasin shaw who refused to sell his little place now he'll-- she hesi- tated now what frosty clark asked bluntly she didn't answer the two riders were close the eyes of the prisoner smouldering under heavy brows burned at frosty clark and moccasin shaw said you've baited a trap clark you've sicced the law on me but you'll never get my little place baited a trap clark grunted you'd still be a free man shaw free to haul beef down to willow grove and sell it if you hadn't made the mis- take of butcherin one of my yearlin's or maybe your mistake was in bein caught--finally it's hard to tell how many of my yearlin's have been-- just one i'd guess said old moc- casin shaw one had to be killed you know so you'd have a fresh hide to plant on my place but that place ain't goin to go by the boards go for taxes so you can grab it no matter what happens to me no matter how many damned lies you and any of your sneakin riders swear to they'll be somebody livin at horseshoe springs you're sellin out clark asked that bothers you don't it shaw retorted he looked at eileen who hav- ing ridden past horseshoe springs a couple of times lately had visited with the lonely old man to her moccasin said if you saved any money on that school teachin job you'd better hide it and deep somewheres coyotes have good smellers you know he looked at clark again clark said to sheriff jim barclay did you trail this crooked old meat peddler down this way just so he could cuss me out barclay nope came the reply i just wanted to tell you and your puncher to be in town tomorrow for the hearin who's takin over shaw's place clark asked how do i know barclay replied well see you in town the riders continued their way clark grunted went in the house eileen sat down on the porch bench and wondered if she hadn't better apply for another school teaching job next winter perhaps there was worse things than winter wind blowing its glacial breath between chinkless logs worse things than unruly headstrong chil- dren    hello there eileen beautiful with a little start the girl turned to see turk powell husky dark and very handsome coming up the trail leading from the bunkhouse it's about time your guardian angel went in the house and allowed you some company you'd really enjoy she smiled it's seldom one sees handsome men who are so modest won't you come up and sit down as if you hadn't started to already oh grandma he retorted smiling how sharp your tongue is tonight sharper than a skinnin knife i'd like to know she said and still more sharply whose skinning knife peeled off the hide that was found in moccasin shaw's possession the hide of a jy yearling turk powell was suddenly sober your uncle tells me you're pretty much upset over this deal good gosh don't blame me for not ridin range with my eyes shut i'm paid to help look after jy stock if i stumbled onto a jy hide over at horseshoe love is the loot  springs when i rode down there to tighten a loose hind shoe on my horse don't blame me for mentionin it to frosty and don't blame him for hav- in old shaw picked up and put where he belongs i'm sorry turk said the girl sud- denly contrite it's just that old moc- casin shaw probably won't have much money to hire a decent lawyer with you want to see him go free don't you turk said then in a low voice he added down deep in my heart i wish the same thing i try to tell my- self that i did right by reportin the hide-findin to frosty that he was payin me to look after his stock but now i half wish i'd just rode back to the ranch drawed my wages and rode away from here not that i could've done that why not she countered wouldn't the loss of one steer mean much less to my uncle than the loss of freedom means to old moccasin a lot less--yeah it wasn't that eileen it was the thought of ridin away from you hold on cowboy you shouldn't-- i know it he answered and i don't want to lose my heart any more than you want old moccasin to lose his freedom but i have i saw you sittin on this porch a month ago and since then-- he stopped jaw set a little then rose abruptly husky erect he stood there sil- houetted for a moment against the afterglow of a sun which had slipped down into a notch of the valley's west rim then he left the porch and headed for the corrals watching him catch and bridle his own sorrel horse eileen heard shorty talbott the other jy puncher call hey turk i thought you wasn't goin to town tonight i've changed my mind came the answer today was payday wasn't it what are we waitin for pretty soon two cowpunchers were loping off and pretty soon two pairs of spurs would be jingling into the noisy saloon there would be drinks eileen walked to the end of the porch and thought you're not afraid to ride bucking horses turk powell but you're afraid to say the thing that's in your heart something tells me i'll be gone from here as soon as school starts next fall so turk powell if you've got anything to say    some- thing that maybe i want to hear you say    it was three nights later before turk powell a bot- tle in his saddle pocket and leading a newly purchased roan horse -- a bucker he hoped to enter in the con- test in tall tree--returned to the jy even then he didn't come up to the porch where eileen sat he stood beside the corral and talked to shorty talbott about the new buck- ing horse somewhat lonesome and a little irked eileen went in the house nor did she even so much as look out the window until she heard the excite- ment down there at the corral the roan bucker had been saddled now out there in the dusk he was really wiping it up with a rider who unable to match with his skill the fury of those long high crooked jumps was losing his balance after the third jump--and crashing to the ground just beyond the corral eileen's heart leaped to her mouth she had only glimpsed that rider be- fore he went spinning down to the earth now the roan horse was wheel- ing was bucking back toward the fallen man she raced out the front door and down the porch steps just as another rider a stranger hard of jaw and lean came spurring around the corner of the house he was pulling his gun as he came and he fired at the roan out- law now bucking back toward his thrown rider the roan bucker squealed veered away from the fallen man and plunged to the earth himself then turk powell --eileen realized now that he wasn't  cliff walters the thrown rider--came running around the corral at the lean bright-haired stranger turk bawled who the hell do you think you are shootin my horse i think i'm dave mayland shootin an outlaw horse before he kills my young brother somebody had to stop that killer--and it's a cinch you wasn't tryin very hard dave mayland rode to the side of his brother a dazed young fellow of about seventeen bent over him and tried to help him to his feet eileen could see then that the younger mayland's left arm dangled limply and his face looked tense and white in the dusk take him in the house called the girl i'll take him to town--on his old bay horse there replied dave may- land his voice harsh flat but first i'll know how come he happened to be twistin broncs for this tinhorn lay- out he come along--from the horse- shoe springs place he said replied turk powell and wanted to borrow a little coffee i told him i'd give him five pounds of coffee if he'd ride the roan and he was game game dave mayland echoed how did bob here know the roan was a killer did you tell him that when you was baitin a seventeen-year-old kid into riskin his neck you needn't answer you and the rest of the scum around this crooked outfit wanted to see anybody--anybody related to old moccasin shaw--smashed all to hell are you drunk mr mayland turk countered calmly not as drunk as you are good then we can talk business start shellin out for that horse you've just killed he cost me fifty dollars i'll pay you off this way dave mayland tall lean savage as a wolf smashed a blow to the face of turk powell who viciously retaliated with a blow of his own then they went at it give and take eileen gasped when a vicious blow staggered turk a little she gasped again when he nearly felled his tough opponent with a smashing uppercut dave mayland didn't go down how- ever blue eyes glinting with fury he waded into turk and punished him with lefts and rights punishment that was still being meted out when frosty clark came running down from the ranch house cut it out frosty bellowed there'll be no fightin here there'll be a lot more of it if this buzzard that ain't quite as handsome as he was a minute ago don't shell out for the doctor bill on my brother's busted arm    come on bob we ridin to town i'd taken you with me in the first place if i'd known you was comin down to this buzzard roost to bum grub i didn't know the jy had it in for us said the younger brother you know what they did to old moccasin don't you they'll have us in jail with him--if they have their way they want the horseshoe springs place to go by the boards remember that are you payin for that horse you killed turk powell asked try to collect all right maybe i will mr may- land as long as you're goin to be livin right handy here if i ketch you alone out on the range-- you've got it backwards came the reply coyotes never chase men but you'll see me as soon as the doc in tall tree hands me the bill for fixin this kid's arm and you'll pay that bill one way or another just like this thievin layout here'll pay moccasin shaw for the time he spends in jail get off this place stay off frosty clark ordered if that damned old thief has brought some of his tribe in here to scare the jy you'd better watch your step i'm not after horse- shoe springs you tried pretty hard to buy it once didn't you said dave mayland love is the loot  well let's see if you get it old moc- casin never had much money but what he got he got honestly and some of that he spent helpin to send me and my brother here to school we happen to know he's honest--which proves that you're a crook mr clark or moccasin wouldn't be in jail as the mayland brothers rode off to- ward town turk powell growled he'll pay me for that buckin horse why did you let that seventeen- year-old boy tackle such a killer as that horse eileen demanded i don't think it was a very sporting thing to do turk but perhaps you're not quite yourself tonight i don't know whether dave mayland's fists have made you a little groggy or whether-- do you s'pose turk would've paid fifty dollars for that roan if he knowed he was a killer inquired shorty tal- bott don't try to defnd a whisky-drink- in tramp like me shorty said turk of course i wanted to see that kid killed tromped to death by a killer's hoofs if there's anything i like bet- ter'n the sight of whiskey it's blood he turned toward the barn and said i'll hook up a team frosty and drag this roan carcass out in the hills that is if your niece can trust me with a team what's she got to do with it frosty clark irked looked hard at his niece who suddenly felt ashamed she wished now she'd remained at the house first thing in the morning turk you and shorty move that bunch of steers down here from the upper pasture the cattle buyer'll be out here pretty early tomorrow eileen went to the house and to her room later she heard the creak of the wagon turk was driving heard the rattle of a log chain and knew a roan outlaw was making his final trip into the sage-covered hills swathed in the haze of the starlight she went to bed but couldn't sleep she kept seeing two men locked in battle turk powell husky and hand- some fighting for all he was worth dave mayland lean fierce cool taking punishment and giving it somehow eileen felt that had there been ten turks to battle dave mayland would have waded into them this tough blond-haired man was made of steel he might be whipped might be killed but never scared and although the girl dreaded the dark shadows of trou- ble she could see on the horizons of rim valley she was glad that moc- casin shaw's little place was being guarded by such a man as dave may- land by mid-morning the following day the cattle buyer and his hired man were driv- ing a bunch of young steers toward tall tree and frosty clark was putting in a heavy envelope fifteen hundred dollars in cash he would have to go to town he told eileen and deposit the money if she'd like to come along maybe i will she answered and stay there two or three days i'd like to make some inquiries about a teach- ing job you'd prefer that to living here asked her uncle and sounded disap- pointed i'd hoped you'd like it here eileen but i guess it's just as lone- some for you as it was for me before you came i--i kinda thought that you and one of the hardest-workin hand- somest punchers i've ever seen would hit it off better'n you do she flushed i'd never suspect you of taking time out from your business to become a matchmaker uncle frosty mother used to tell me that's why you'd never married i guess i shouldn't blurt things out the way i do he answered turk seemed to think he'd be inheritin some money one of these days that he might buy an interest in the outfit here i just thought that--well-- i see he'll be more than just a cow- puncher some day i'm glad to hear it  cliff walters   but i'm afraid that whatever i think about him he isn't quite so fond of me as he appeared to be at first let's just forget it for a little while at least that trouble last night upset everyone it seems i'll get into my riding togs and-- turk powell came riding up to the porch then tipping his hat he said i'm here to apologize to you eileen for saying what i did last night and to tell you frosty that the fence is broke down in the pasture where you keep the little bunch of purebred white faces hell clark growled we can't have them mixin with the range cattle well we'll have to postpone the trip to town eileen i'll use the house for a bank today i guess he started in- doors anything i can help with turk asked the girl an extra rider could help round up them strayin purebreds all right they're already in the rough country to the west of the pasture i'll help then eileen hurried inside changed to her riding clothes and was at the corral almost as soon as her uncle was didn't turk wait asked the girl no time to wait now the girl and her uncle rode toward the upper valley they were crossing a ridge when eileen said look she was pointing toward horseshoe springs but there was no cabin there now only a charred spot where it had stood and half the corral was charred wreckage before frosty clark chose to com- ment on what he saw a rider came over the ridge he was dave mayland still stern of jaw and with the battle smoul- dering in his blue eyes to clark he said i don't see you sheddin any tears over what you see clark i guess i made a mistake last night when i said in front of you that i was takin my broken-armed kid brother to town those words were arrows sped from the taut bow of hate hold on mayland clark growled i didn't set no fires last night i was at home and-- well ask this girl why bother askin her came the reply she probably don't want her rich uncle stuck behind bars--where he deserves to be a lot more'n old moccasin shaw nope you ride to town with me clark now i can't right now and i wouldn't anyhow if you're pullin a trick of some kind mayland to get me behind bars--show me up as a cabin-burnin crook and force me to drop charges against your uncle-- so you won't come to town eh well you'll come later my uncle didn't burn your cabin eileen said sharply he was at home all last night and this morning too was he dave mayland answered he touched spurs to his horse and rode on down the valley come on eileen let's get them cattle rounded up said her uncle don't fret about mayland troubled the girl followed her uncle the two of them were heading into the rough country west of the purebred pasture when again topping a ridge frosty clark froze in his sad- dle and pointed down valley eileen stared gasped as she saw a cloud of black smoke rolling up into the sky-- above the spot where the jy ranch buildings were located dirty damned tribe clark spurred his horse toward home with eileen spurring after him but it was quite a long ride the house was a roaring inferno when the two riders were still a mile away they could only spur on and watch it burn my clothes all i've got cried the distraught girl yeah--clothes her uncle yelled what about that fifteen hundred cash oh heavens she moaned she hadn't thought about that once on the scene it was all eileen and clark could do to save the barn and other buildings toward which love is the loot  breeze-whipped sparks were sailing then turk powell his horse dripping sweat came spurring down valley and worked like a trojan to help frosty clark stared at the charred remains of his ranch home he said i'll put dave mayland behind bars for this and for the rest of his life or kill him mayland turk echoed did he do this yes clark growled you can't swear that he did it eileen put in stop meddling stop tryin to whitewash that crooked layout her uncle exploded you didn't want old shaw jailed when turk caught him with the goods on him nor maybe you don't know that moccasin shaw was mixed up with a wild bunch of lootin coyotes a few years ago one of that bunch wind river doyle was caught and wounded in shaw's cabin at horse- shoe springs doyle a killer holin up there when-- but about young mayland turk cut in what makes you think he burned your house  cause he accused me of burnin the horseshoe springs cabin then he rode down this way you s'pose his cabin's really burned turk said or was it just an excuse to-- it's burned all right clark said i saw it but mayland could've done it himself so he'd have an alibi for this the cowman clenched his hands is your gun and shorty's in the bunkhouse yeah turk answered and i think it's time we was takin those guns some fresh horses and headin along mayland's trail we'll find him all right so it's going to be murder now is it eileen spoke tensely a man is going to be shot down without trial stop meddlin her uncle shouted he turned followed turk toward the bunkhouse after an instant's hesitation eileen turned the slim gray horse she rode into the willows fringing the creek a minute later she was riding fast pick- ing up the fresh tracks of a horse traveling toward tall tree meddlin she said to herself well if meddling can prevent mur- dering   eileen rode fast as she followed the tall line of trees which followed rim creek yet she was some little distance from the ranch when rounding a bend of the stream she came upon a solitary rider he was staring at the ground ahead of him and now turned quickly and dropped his hand to the forty-five slung at his hip you said dave mayland and stopped his horse don't stop she answered ride faster get to town as soon as you can go to sheriff barclay's place and then-- why he asked so you won't be killed--or have to kill anyone else she answered im- patiently my uncle and turk powell are going to be riding down this valley pretty soon too soon perhaps and they're carrying guns now oh if you'd gone to town--gone to the sheriff in the first place instead of stopping to set that fire-- i didn't set fire to anything he interrupted you can tell that in court she an- swered you'll stand a better chance there than you will here in these hills stay in town don't come back what's been burned now he asked the jy ranch house his narrowed eyes were suddenly suspicious what kind of a trap is this one i was goin to town but now i'm not and who's that rider headin for horseshoe springs way up there he pointed to a horseman disappearing from view how do i know she said  cliff walters i'll find out he spurred his horse across the creek you fool eileen shouted i tried to warn you but-- he was already be- yond hearing distance tears welled to the girl's eyes this is what she got for meddling the censure of her uncle and the distrust of a man she was trying to protect she turned her horse started home- ward slowly she hadn't gone far when she met her uncle and turk powell turk said where's that fire-crazy mayland did you come down here and warn him i told him to get to town--yes as fast as he could she answered truth- fully he'll have to ride fast--if he ever gets there turk answered come on frosty the two men rode on at a fast clip and eileen was grateful for the screen of thickly growing trees which hid from view the range beyond the stream then she had reason to be still more grateful sure that dave mayland would make for town with all possible haste clark and turk powell veered off the road and headed across open range for a distant butte around which the road wound they thought ap- parently that this would gain them a little time eileen didn't ride back to the charred ruins of the ranch house wondering as to the identity of the rider on the black horse whom dave mayland had sighted she crossed the creek and headed for horseshoe springs shorty talbott the jy puncher had ridden a black horse this morning was he up to something and did he know some- thing about the burning of the cabin at horseshoe springs a little more meddling won't hurt the girl told herself the girl was within a few hundred yards of horseshoe springs when she stopped beside a dense clump of cedars to watch the movements of a man who had ridden a black horse up there was that shorty talbott get back outa sight said the voice of dave mayland sharply as he spoke he emerged from the cedars grabbed her bridle bit and forced her gray back a few steps who drug that dead roan horse out in the hills last night turk powell she answered why he didn't answer that he just said thanks for makin your uncle and powell think i'd hit out for town i saw em dustin it that way i'm sorry now i said what i did to you i might've known just by lookin at you that you're as decent as you are pretty is that shorty talbott up there at the spring nope it's a stranger to me i don't know what he's doin up there look at him pawin around that crevice in the rim just below the place where the cabin stood like a coyote huntin a lost den what is he hunting he asked i wish i knew but we'll wait let him find it if he can then we'll ride up there that was quite a wait one during which the girl and man talked in low tones dave mayland denied having set fire to the jy ranch house the way he spoke that denial the way in which his gaze met eileen's made her feel he spoke the truth i'm not here to fight and burn houses he told her i'm here to look after moccasin shaw's place keep an eye on his few head of stock hold the fort till he's freed that old man's honest eileen clark as honest and generous as they come it was him that sent grub money to my mother when bob and me were little--and starvin but your uncle ain't satisfied with jail- in moccasin he's got to burn his cabin the only home the old man's got or have it burned how long was turk powell away from the ranch last night when he drug that roan's carcass out to-- there's turk now said the girl excitedly and pointed to a horseman love is the loot  wending his way among the cedars on another ridge between the rimrock and the one she and dave occupied yeah it seemed as if dave may- land were bristling like a lean mastiff but he made no move turk powell rode on dismounted and crouched behind a huge rock jut- ting from the ridge a position from which he could watch the mysterious man working over by the rimrock suddenly that mysterious man--he had disappeared into the rocky crevice which split the rimrock's base--came hurrying out he was jamming some- thing into his pockets as he hurried toward his black horse but he never quite reached the black the gun in turk powell's hand cracked--and down went the little man eileen gasped moaned of all the cowardly acts dave had pulled his gun he was watching turk powell cautiously de- scend the ridge and move toward the fallen man dave moved too and eileen followed pretty soon the girl heard the wounded man yell don't shoot no more powell we'll split the roll split--hell powell rumbled i got to this range first frenchy it was me that made it safe for loot-hunters around here i got rid of old mocas- sin shaw and was gettin rid of his damned nephews i thought it might take quite a hunt to find what you've got in your pocket there it's as much mine as it is yours powell groaned the hard-looking lit- tle man called frenchy i overheard wind river doyle and boots ballan- tine talkin about the cache same as you did wind river doyle that name came back to eileen now that was the out- law her uncle had mentioned this morning the wounded outlaw who had been trapped at moccasin shaw's cabin evidently doyle hadn't want- ed shaw to know that he carried loot money or old moccasin might have turned him in to sheriff jim barclay shaw didn't know doyle was an outlaw accordin to wind river's story powell was saying to frenchy but nobody up on this range knows what i am either well with this money i can make love to a certain pretty girl pour my heart out to her at least let me get away with my life powell frenchy pleaded i will like hell the gun in pow- ell's hand started to come up again better not powell called dave mayland turk powell whirled as dave with his free hand shoved eileen away from him two guns roared their noisy defiance at each other and sent echoes hammering at the rim- rock eileen stifled a cry and dreaded to look yet she did look and saw turk powell lips twitching spin half- way around by the impact of a bullet that had raked across his left ribs he swore tried to right himself and whip his gun around for a second shot at dave mayland whose left arm had been furrowed by a bullet again dave shot and with the cool fierce deliberation that had marked with battle of fists with turk powell this time powell's gun fell from his hand a hand that was useless because the arm above it had been smashed by lead good for you stranger said frenchy who had already felt the sting of powell's gunfire dave paid no attention to that trib- ute gun still lveled for action he moved slowly toward powell who handsome face pale and distorted with pain now slumped on the ground so you made this place safe for loot-hunters eh dave asked it don't look too safe right now does it before i take you to town though i'm collectin--if you've got any cash on you--for that doctor bill you're s'posed  cliff walters to pay he started ripping at powell's pockets suddenly eileen emitted a cry there was no time to stifle a long packet of money in an envelope had come into view what's all this dave mayland asked where did you make this haul not punchin cows i hope powell that's uncle fred's money shouted the girl now i know who burned the ranch house and that's why the pasture fence was torn down --so my uncle couldn't go to town and put that money in the bank the same gent set fire to this cabin here said dave on the way up here i stopped by the carcass of a roan horse i could see where somebody had unhitched a team and had rode one of those horses in this direction you might as well tell us about that yearlin hide that got moccasin in trouble too powell or will i choke the truth out of you i planted the hide powell an- swered what the hell's the difference who knows it now eileen turned to see her uncle walk- ing around the half-burned corral she called come here uncle frosty and hear what happened i've heard enough and seen enough he said flatly his frosty eyes on powell why didn't you kill him mayland when he gave you such a good chance i'd rather have him talk like he has and then spend the rest of his days behind bars came the reply well there's your money mr clark i--i don't know about this loot that these crooks have uncovered keep it mumbled clark you sure deserve some reward for shootin powell and besides-- clark didn't finish frenchy larue who had broken out of the penitentiary a few days ago had squirmed around in his agony to- ward the gun which had fallen from powell's hand now that gun cracked lead tore into turk powell who rocked over and lay still turn about eh groaned frenchy himself on the verge of death the gun in his hand sagged to the earth and his fingers relaxed eileen shudered turned away her uncle came along before she had gone many steps laid a gentle hand on her arm and said thanks for meddlin lady if blinded by powell's tricks i'd helped him kill dave mayland this morning   promise me i'm really forgiven she tried to smile but tears were in her eyes something had melted the frosty armor from this man there was gentleness in his tone in his eyes now if you promise to live in that new house we're goin to build on the jy he replied a house you can design and make it big enough because-- because what hey mayland he called moc- casin'll be comin home as soon as we get to town how about you helpin me run the jy eileen wants you to and-- well if she wants me to    dave mayland was actually smiling a warm friendly smile that did something to eileen's heart will you have a job for my kid brother too after his arm's well sure clark answered the more maylands the better from what i've seen of em how about you eileen that goes for me too she an- swered firmly thanks for sayin that said dave coming forward now but i warn you if i'm near you all the time eileen clark i'm goin to start makin love --and for the first time in my life take the change from that quarter you've spent on ranch romances and buy a war savings stamp stars of the arena joe welch roper and bronc-rider joe welch one of our top rodeo contestants was born and raised in carlsbad new mexico and was content with making the shows around his home town till the bug really bit him in  the first rodeo where he cashed in big was at roswell new mexico when he won both the roping and bronc-riding from then on he couldn't stay put so he decided to come to new york and try his luck at the garden in the fall of  he won the calf-roping and bareback bronc-riding there and that's going some when you have the cream of the rodeo world to compete against at the twin falls idaho rodeo he won the calf-roping and in -- the all-around cowboy title at soda springs idaho later the same title was his at north platte nebraska and numerous other titles have come his way since he left the old homestead at carlsbad joe is a neighbor of elmer helper a top-hand who quit the rodeo game to run his own ranch it looks as if the game would lose joe one of these days too he's already deputy sheriff at carlsbad under sheriff hal gage and likely it's only a

two and a half and jan one and a half jim al- ready rides his own horse at the opening night in the garden this fall joe made the fastest time in both bulldogging and calf-roping he roped his calf in sixteen seconds flat and threw his steer in thirteen tex sherman  judy of the circle bar by  stephen payne right out of the movies he stepped into judy's life would he walk out again as quickly to judy he looked like the average fisherman from the big city--rub- ber boots and creel a slouch hat with flies hooked around its band and a soft shirt open at the neck with sleeves rolled up as if to aid the wearer in acquiring a coat of tan she had come stealing up behind him as he stood near the corral casting his line in the clear stream he must have heard her there for he turned and smiled and took off his hat judy caught her breath he was young and athletic with wide shoul- ders and dark wavy hair such a fas- cinating smile too tommy hargraves couldn't have smiled like that if he practiced in front of a mirror for ten years why hello young lady am i dreaming or are you real judy couldn't help feeling pleased but she must not let this very good- looking stranger get his way by induc- ing her to swallow such flattery she said i saw you drive your car across the bridge where the willows would hide you from the house i listened to make sure and after i heard you shut off your motor i waited until you came down the river now i've caught you fishing on our ranch although he was still smiling the young fellow looked a bit shame-faced but i haven't caught even one of your wily trout and i did want a mess of  judy of the circle bar  them for my dinner a wistful glance at the stream i've driven two hundred miles to get here judy steeled herself to be cold and hard and practical that's not my fault you couldn't have helped seeing the no fishing sign on our gate now you must go but this is my first chance to get into the mountains to camp and to fish and to sleep in the open i've been looking forward to it when my new picture was finished at last i threw my duffel into the old car and-- your new picture judy's voice was filled with awe then you--you're a movie hero the stranger started to reel in his line in a modest way yes perhaps you've seen my name--brant com- stock brant comstock well she blushed you see i hardly ever see any pictures    but that you're an actor does make a difference does it the smile had returned and there was a gay twinkle in the deep brown eyes both smile and twinkle do- ing strange things to judy's romantic heart and now may i ask your name it's tudy forrest impulsively she added suppose you catch that mess of trout then suppose i cook them for you you see since you're camping alone and i'm holding down the ranch alone if we can eat together we'll both be less lonesome a jim-dandy idea but do you mean to say miss judy you're alone on this big ranch judy shrugged i'm seventeen and there's nothing to be afraid of i suppose not but i can't imagine your folks leaving-- daddy and mother had to drive to dawson on busines they know i'll be all right i've stayed alone before you have judy surveying her with frank admiration but if the fishing goes well i may not get back until evening that ok ok judy was radiant now it's settled we'll have supper together adios not even feeling her feet touch the earth she sped back to the house what was this new and strange and wonder- ful something which had come into her life joyfully she carried in wood and wa- ter she built a fire in the range and made a cake and a pie what else would they have for supper fresh butter and fresh buttermilk would be a treat for brant so judy churned al- though this was onlv tuesday and the churning was usually done on satur- day she fed the chickens and gathered the egg's she fed the pigs she corralled the milk cows she watered and fed her saddle pony torchy she had even done the milking and separated the milk when at last brant comstock ar- rived though he was sunburned and bitten by mosquitoes and gnats he was hap- piness itself he called hi judy just look at this catch twenty all ready to fry i could almost eat em raw i'll bet you could you won't have to do that    brant over there across the bridge where you left your car isn't a good place to camp why couldn't you pull in here and pitch your tent somewhere in the yard judy had told him she wasn't afraid of being alone but all the same it would be reassuring to have someone near that is someone like brant comstock she noticed that he hesitated pinch- ing his sunburned chin where whiskers were showing their dark heads at last he shrugged and she heard him mur- mur i guess it's all right fella there's nobody around here to talk judy watching brant go for his car thought with alarm there is some- body mrs hargraves darn her scan- dal-wangling tongue and dad prob- ably asked tommy hargraves to come to help me with the chores even though i told him not to bother a minute later she was cooking the  stephen payne trout she had biscuits browning in the oven lima beans simmering in a pot potatoes frying in a skillet she heard the brown car chug-chug into the yard and pull up beside the little old ice house and brant had already pitched his tent before she called come and get it brant ate like a hungry man thor- oughly enjoying every bite when at last pie and cake appeared he cried why judy you shouldn't have done all this for me you're a dream girl meaning what brant her head on one side birdlike would his answer be disappointing it wasn't it was exactly what she hoped he would say the kind of girl a fellow dreams about yet never hopes to find when the pie had gone the way of all good pies she said you must light your pipe brant his eyes were one great twinkle why actors--the kind i like most-- smoke pipes and have their pictures taken posing sort of like this striking an attitude judy judy you're one continual source of amazement and of delight however i do smoke a pipe so here goes    should the chin be up or down a bit more get the exact pro- file photographer    now about dishes and other chores i've done practically everything ex- cept dishes you can wash and i'll wipe and then mr brant comstock you're to tell me all about your work the dishwashing was fun but when they were seated in the living room with brant enjoying his pipe he dis- appointed her i'd lots rather hear about you judy--about your life here but brant there's nothing here nothing i know all about that's interest- ing or romantic or thrilling it's all so dull and drab and humdrum i don't believe that for a minute-- not ranch life let me tell you about it so you can see how stupid it is we--that's dad- dy and mother and i--raise hay on the circle bar in the spring we fix fences to keep cattle out of our fields and we start irrigating to raise the hay it's just one round of hard work from daylight till dark but now daddy and mother are gone to dawson to try to get money so we can go into the cattle business if we can everything will be lots more interesting i like to punch cows i ride down to the box four and the tu lots of times and work with the cow- boys get a big kick out of it and they say i make a hand too i love breaking broncs and trailing cattle i'm dippy over little calves and most of all i love the roundups but here at home we just raise hay when it's ready to cut we get a crew of men to put it up in stacks you know i help mother cook for the crew or i run a sweep or a rake is that so dull judy dull brant it's deadly only ex- citement is if you have a bad runaway i had a humdinger last summer got thrown off the rake and dragged along by its teeth if the rake hadn't bounced up in the air i guess i'd have been a goner    in the fall we fence the haystacks then daddy sells the hay to some cow- man who puts cattle in the fields and when snow comes daddy feeds the hay to the cattle the snow gets neck deep to a tall indian and we wear out two four-horse teams breaking trails to the haystacks you must always feed the cattle blizzard or no blizzard daddy and i were out in a blizzard last winter where we couldn't see even the wheel team how did you ever get home oh the horses stuck to the trail they're real smart about that because if they get off the trail they're wallow- ing in snow to their necks    once in a while there's a dance and sometimes we go to town all terribly exciting isn't it i think i'd find it so said brant judy opened her eyes wider all ex- citement and interest again she edged judy of the circle bar  her chair around until she was facing brant in the lamplight why you were interested of course i was    and now i'll hit the hay good night judy blew out the lamp and sat for a little while in the soft darkness a smile on her lips and a warm glow en- veloping her but everyone says the course of true love never runs smooth she told herself the following morning she was again walking on air while brant helped with the chores he showed more skill with ranch work than should of a city fellow he even insisted upon milking ornery the bad-tempered cow who delighted in kicking and jerking and for his stub- bornness brant was kicked over milk bucket stool and all he helped judy get the breakfast and they had just finished the meal when there was a chud of hoofs fol- lowed by a metallic ring of spurs and tommy hargraves was standing in the open kitchen door judy's frightened eyes saw brant's amused glance travel up the stocky body of this self-important young man tommy wore run-over cowhide boots greasy overalls with a red bandanna hanging half out of one hip pocket a faded blue shirt in need of a visit to a wash tub leather cuffs and a slouchy black hat this hat he did not bother to lift from tangled black hair which framed raggedly a full round face with too-small mouth and too-wide nose and eyes that were little and dark and mean judy instantly on her feet was in- stantly on the defensive as well wh-- why hello tommy you needn't have come i--i'm making out dandy ye-ah i see you are tommy said it meaningly and favored brant com- stock with a slant-eyed look still with that amused smile brant took the situation in hand introduc- ing himself and shaking hands with tommy i'm enjoying the fishing here--and also judy's hospitality ye-ah i see you are repeating his earlier words a city jake ain't you brant shrugged unconcernedly i suppose i might be called that you're a cowman i take it tommy swelled with importance sure am you from the city com- stock my ma'll want to know tommy's mother would indeed want to know judy felt rage and rebellion surging within her now why should this--this lout have to appear at the circle bar and spoil everything brant however seemed quite unruf- fled that's right hargraves    we-ell if i'm going to hook a mess of trout for lunch i must be at it you'll excuse me brant was cheerfully whistling there's a long long trail as he went to his tent but judy felt no music either in her mind or in her heart she found her hands trembling as she cleared the table she felt tommy's eyes upon her questioning suspicious condemning your dad and ma gone said tommy him and you all there is on the place it's none of your business and it's all right you just wait till my ma hears bout this judy's heart leaped into her throat and choked her she knew how gos- sipy mrs hargraves could twist even the most trivial incident into the pat- tern she wished it to take judy be- lieved this woman's wagging tongue the most malicious thing in all the near- by world tommy hargraves so very like his mother was licking his lips as if al- ready gloating over the promised scan- dal there were a few terrible mo- ments during which judy as if a night- mare gripped her could say nothing then she heard your old dad hates tourists city jakes and fishermen but just the min- ute him and your ma go away miss  stephen payne judy takes up with a young city slicker and-- stop cried judy you're just as nasty as your horrid old mother you're-- you slamming my ma oh i didn't mean that not the way it sounded judy thought quick- ly you see tommy the situation isn't what you think it is at all i--i have every right in the world to live in the same house with brant com- stock if i choose huh tommy looked slightly less like a smug hypocrite what you getting at judy brant is my husband having taken this plunge judy thought triumphantly there will that spike the guns of the gossips but in another moment tommy was hooting the idea that judy could have been married so quickly after her par- ents had left the ranch he demanded proof and judy told a convincing story a story based on the fact that during the month of april she had visited her aunt in the city--as tommy and the entire neighborhood knew at that time she had met brant comstock and they had been married keeping the wedding quiet because she was under age never- theless daddy and mother had been delighted and when brant had come to the ranch early yesterday they had welcomed him as their son but after tommy had mounted and turned his horse toward the gate lead- ing to the highway he threw a parting shot well the wedding sure won't be a secret no longer when she could again think clearly judy asked herself with terrible uneasi- ness i wonder if i haven't jumped out of the frying pan into the fire she petted the big yellow cat told him her worries and received in re- turn only the cold comfort of a com- plaining meow the day dragged past as if it never would end then once again it was evening and the chores were done and supper was all ready except for frying the trout brant would bring when he did arrive he was more sun- burned more tortured by mosquitoes and gnats than yesterday but he was gloriously happy--so happy that his mood transmitted itself to troubled judy supper was over the dishes washed brant's pipe was scenting the living room where he and judy were sit- ting with the big old kero- scene lamp between them on the table when all at once from out-of- doors on every side of the log house arose a most terrific din the blast of a trumpet and a mouth organ the tinny rattle of pieces of iron on dish- pans and tubs the clanging of cowbells and the wild whooping of many voices all combined into an ear-splitting bed- lam of noise brant dropped his pipe and threw at the girl a strange startled glance what the dickens what the dickens reiterated judy marveling that her lips and tongue had moved when otherwise she felt petri- fied faces at the windows now men and women girls and boys pounding on the glass rattling the doors a stentorian voice called hi there bride and groom open up and give us a treat the cigars are on you never had judy seen anyone look quite so astounded as brant comstock she sprang up and caught his arm it's a charivari she said in a hollow tone oh brant and her eyes sought him you must--you must act as if we're married and go through with it bu--but why judy it's all a mis- take no wildly they think-- here they are    oh hello mrs gates and mrs bridger hello everybody how do you do mrs hargraves you old hell-cat hello tommy i could choke you judy of the circle bar  thus judy carried on a smile on her lips her heart frozen with dread wel- coming the neighbors the ranchers and their wives their sons and daughters their cowboys and ranch hands she introduced brant to them all at once my husband brant comstock every- body she watched the young fellow with only she knew what trepidation but he played up to her lead he carried out the deception magnificently like the actor he was soon the living room was cleared of its furniture and rugs old mort good- speed turned up his fiddle and bert dawson his banjo together they op- ened up with turkey in the straw the neighbors were dancing judy was dancing with them one after another square dances waltzes two-steps brant was right in the thick of it apparently having a grand time and how the neighborhood girls sought for his fav- ors judy felt pride she also felt jealousy the gay crowd had brought refresh- ments expecting the newlyweds to furnish nothing except coffee and the dishes time for the midnight supper judy eating with brant as if all was very right and proper--she strangely silent and preoccupied brant talking gaily making a hit with the shrewd ranchers too even if he was a city fel- low mrs hargraves bustling about and boasting how she had been the first one to hear the news and to spread it darn her anyhow then at last the merrymakers were gone at last judy and brant were alone he seized her shoulders roughly judy forrest what was back of all this judy shook herself free please let me alone i can't explain now perhaps i never can she ran to her room to hide her hot shamed face in the pillow and let the tears run unchecked down her cheeks the bright july sun awakened her for she had slept late very late when she had thought she could never sleep again in the bare and rather forlorn living room she glanced through a window and saw that brant's car was gone her breath caught in her tight throat so she must face the music all alone could she ever explain to daddy and mother to the neighbors she could hear tongues clacking could see the sly glances the pointing fingers she couldn't she wouldn't face this gossip she'd go far away from this place away writing a note for mother and dad- dy was the hardest thing she had ever attempted it would take pages to ex- plain and she didn't want to explain anyhow finally in desperation she wrote dearest daddy and mums i love you love you love you but i must leave home judy after this judy took not the road past the hg ranch where that horrid hargraves woman and tommy lived but the pass trail at length torchy her pony was climbing the steep slopes of the great mountain range when judy heard a car roaring behind her torchy snorted and turned aside as the car gained the crest of the ridge and stopped a bare-headed young man sunburned and badly bitten by mosquitoes and gnats sprang out of the car judy he cried and lifted her from her saddle oh brant she choked you-- you followed me yes i found that i couldn't go away and leave you loving you as i do judy honey we'll make it real--that fake wedding and the charivari and we'll buy us a real cow ranch and set- tle down shall we she clung to him all her cares and all her worries magically erased erased by the power of love we'll make it real you mean it brant darling and the pressure of his lips on hers was the most reassuring answer he could have given her skyline trail by  l lindley mulkey like a hero in some fanciful tale of old boyd hanley flew from beyond the horizon to fran taylor's range bright sunlight flooded across low hills as fran taylor raced the snowy al- bino down the little valley and came to a stop at its end red-brown curls framed the girl's flushed face sturdy cords and high-laced boots garbed her slim form with studied concentration in brown eyes fran put the albino through his paces walking on hind feet kneeling playing dead an im- pressive repertoire but fran had promised colonel morehouse that white arrow would be a high school  skyline trail  horse when he rode him in the wagon- tire rodeo that fall a nice exhibition spoke a voice from behind fran turned from the task of teach- ing white arrow to pick up a handker- chief with bared teeth a tall young man wearing whipcords and leather jacket stood at the foot of a small knoll he's not for sale stated the girl calmly the newcomer's eyes twinkled nice eyes thought fran with an innate friendliness in their depths sounds as if you'd had some offers he commented about three a week whenever i see an hombre stalking across the range with a determined look on his face and admiration in his eyes i know what he's got in mind need that admiration always be for a horse inquired the other gently crimson banners waved in fran's smooth cheeks it always has been then count this day an exception plainly the young man was enjoying her confusion i'm in the market for a phone not a horse my plane's grounded over beyond that rise it was then fran noted the tiny pair of silver wings on the lapel of his leather jacket a flyer it developed that his name was boyd hanley en- gaged in range seeding with a second- hand plane he'd picked up at auction two months before a cantankerous old lady hanley chuckled i have to humor her a lot but she scatters grass seed like no- body's business and i figure this job'll cover the cost of a new plane when i've finished fran had heard of the government's plan to re-establish overgrazed range- lands by means of airplane seeding but she hadn't realized the project extended this far north there's a phone at my lazy q she offered you'll see the buildings just beyond the bend in the trail i'm not good at findin my way around alone mock gravity marked the flyer's bronzed face you couldn't --er--personally conduct me to that phone fran's lips quirked a dimple appear- ing momentarily just follow the trail you can't miss it but i'm a sky rider not a trail walker if there's anything in this well known range hospitality   there is laughed the girl capitu- lating but some people take advan- tage of it somehow the sunshine seemed brighter the sky more heavenly blue as fran and boyd hanley strolled along the valley trail with white ar- row following a magnificent animal the albino slim-barreled yet power- ful every line of him from arched neck to flowing silver tail bespoke a royal lineage first time i ever saw a pure al- bino spoke boyd hanley glancing back at the spirited horse pure whites are very rare and then fran was telling of the day three years before when she'd found a weak little all-white colt struggling in a sand pit and had taken it home to hand raise from one of those wild hill bands i reckon surmised hanley i often see em when i'm cruisin over the breaks makes you a pretty valuable horse i guess with all those tricks he knows he's not mine any more said the girl not since colonel morehouse of- fered three thousand and laid the cash on the line it meant paying up a lot of debts and putting the lazy q in the clear but you had other offers dozens but it wasn't only the money most of the would-be buyers were show people who'd drag white arrow from one end of the country to the other for what they could make out of him but colonel morehouse loves horses his flying m's a regular horse heaven he had to go east this sum- mer on business and asked me to finish  l lindley mulkey training the albino ready for fall de- livery they had reached the little lazy q ranch house with its trim outbuildings and pole corrals in that moment fran thrilled with pride of ownership for- getting those times when loneliness lay like a pall on the little spread when her feet yearned to dance with other young feet when she longed for com- panionship other than that of old pad- dy mcgrew reckon there's another buyer for the albino chuckled boyd hanley as they reached the yard gate for the first time fran noticed the two men who'd come from the lazy q barn and the two saddled mounts tied near the corral i'll go down and talk to them while you use the phone she said it's just inside the kitchen door as fran continued along the path she wished white arrow were already in colonel morehouse's big flying m corral so she'd be finished with this matter of refusing would-be buyers some underground telegraph of the range had spread the arrow's fame far and wide    his beauty his spirit his speed only last week there'd been a letter from a circus owner in chicago others had come in person to the lazy q their disappointment doubled upon seeing the arrow the two men at the corral gate were patently father and son possessing the same long nose and beady black eyes both wore shoddy range clothes with lank dark hair showing below battered stetsons their one difference was in weight the father being heavy-set the son of rangier build dark eyes lighted as they took in white arrow's high-flung head and the beautiful symmetry of shoulders back and withers our name's felton carnival folks showin in wagontire this week spoke the older man we could use a good hoss act in our program is the albino for sale fran repeated the refusal which had become almost a habit colonel more- house owns white arrow now reckon he'd sell you'd have to ask him about that suddenly fran became aware of the younger man's stare taking her in from head to foot there was something rapacious in those small close-set eyes as if they saw below the modest neck- line of her blouse color spilled into her cheeks making them doubly lovely reckon we've come on a goose chase jud spoke snide felton sour- ly we'll be gettin back to town without further words the two mounted and rode toward the lazy q gate a pretty pair boyd hanley had come down the corral path and stopped behind fran a pretty disappointed pair shrugged the girl did you get your call through i did that they're sending me out some oil from wagontire it'll probably take an hour all during the follow- ing week as fran put white arrow through his daily practise in the little valley north of the lazy q ranch house she watched for boyd hanley's plane cruising back and forth across the range invariably on passing he dipped his wings in greeting and fran would wave back her heart per- forming queer antics in her breast it was wednesday afternoon that paddy mcgrew man of all work on the lazy q saddled a small bay so fran could ride into wagontire for the mail the little cattle town flaunt- ed a holiday air with the traveling carnival's tent pitched at one end of the main street fran noted the outfit as she came out of the post office and wondered what part the feltons father and son played in it like all such wandering troops they showed only in the evening when folk from the surrounding hills rode in for skyline trail  a bit of fun fran was about to swing aboard her bay and start for home when she saw an old woman in faded gypsy dress come out of the carnival tent huge earrings dangled from her ears but that which riveted fran's at- tention was a big snake coiled about the woman's neck the reptile lifted its ugly head then slid like quicksilver along its bearer's arm fran moved clos- er drawn by a sort of horrified fascina- tion the carnival woman looked up you like my leetle pet she smirked with a grin fran shuddered how can you stand it about your neck ah but ees he not a pretty neck- lace see how he glistens in the sun the woman handled the snake deftly to show off its colors but come you shall see all of tanya's pets you--you're a snake charmer questioned the girl a swift repugnance in her eyes but yes for many years tanya have love the snakes and they also have love her the old woman turned and lifted the tent flap come you shall see tanya snarled a masculine voice inside the tent the old woman stiffened a swift fear in dark eyes tanya come here wait muttered the old woman to fran and disappeared behind the tent flap fran hesitated then suddenly came that same snarling masculine voice from inside you old hag the only time people see them snakes is when they're payin for it we ain't givin no free shows a moment later tanya reappeared a sullen fear in wrinkled face eef the leetle lady come back tonight then will i show my pets she mumbled no thanks you tell snide felton i've seen all of his show i care to without further words fran swung aboard her bay and heeled him swiftly down the street somehow the air seemed cleaner away from that shabby carnival tent and to think the fel- tons had wanted to buy white arrow fran's repugnance lasted until she reached home shortly before sundown old paddy mcgrew was puttering about the lazy q corral brushing white arrow's satiny coat and patient- ly waiting for supper paddy irish as the proverbial shamrock with his gray- streaked hair and turned-up nose had been hired by fran as man of all work but had delegated himself her guardian as well that there range seeder was here this afternoon he stated stretching a diminutive five feet four to comb white arrow's flowing mane color spilled into fran's cheeks you mean boyd hanley the flyer yeah i reckon leastways he was wearin a pair of them little silver wings on his lapel a smothered pulse beat in fran's throat what did he want nothin much he hung around about an hour watchin me exercise white arrow said to tell you he'd stop by in the mornin old paddy mcgrew gave the albino's coat a finish- ing touch jest how much d'you know about this here aviator miss fran know about boyd fran started to say that boyd hanley was the most ex- citing person she'd ever met then changed her mind why--why i know he has a gov- ernment contract for range seeding and that he plans to buy a new plane with the money he makes fran paused what makes you ask paddy i dunno the old irishman kicked diffidently at a pebble it's jest that a purty girl without no father nor moth- er to look after her has to be kinda careful of strangers paddy in the role of mrs grundy fran wanted to laugh but knew the old cowhand's concern was born of loyalty and affection that's all right paddy you don't need to worry about boyd hanley now turn arrow into his stall and get  l lindley mulkey washed up for supper i'll have it ready in a jiffy all in all it had been a disappointing day for fran first that annoying inci- dent of the snake charmer and snide felton and then being away when when boyd hanley had called per- haps boyd had wanted to ask her to go to the big mid-summer dance in wag- ontire next week fran went to bed but not to sleep the mid-summer dance there was that pale green frock she'd sent for in the mail-order catalogue it'd be here in time pale green brought out red tints in her hair and did something for her eyes fran was up with the sun but paddy who bunked at the barn in a little room off white arrow's stall hadn't come in yet fran sounded the breakfast triangle a second time and when the old man still didn't appear went down the path to- ward the corral it wasn't like paddy to oversleep fran reached the corral gate and then suddenly stopped a groan sound- ed from over near the watering trough the next moment she saw paddy mc- grew lying in half out of the trough with a crimson trickle of blood across his forehead paddy paddy fran worked swiftly lifting the old cowhand and laying him on the ground for one terrifying moment she thought he was dead then another groan passed his lips fran rose and sped to the house returning a moment later with a flask of brandy a few drops forced between paddy's lips and his eyes slow- ly opened miss  fran  white arrow white arrow a paralyzing fear struck the girl gone    stolen gasped paddy struggling for breath and then as fran forced more brandy between his lips the old man gained strength for speech i was goin to bed last night then remembered the water hadn't been turned off here in the trough it was dark when i come out and i didn't see nobody around but as i bent down feelin for the faucet somethin hit me from behind i jest went numb all over then a flash o white came through the barn door    but some- how i couldn't move or yell reckon later i passed clean out white arrow stolen and she'd guaranteed the albino's delivery in an- other month she'd even spent the three thousand colonel morehouse had paid these thoughts raced like fire through fran's mind as she ran to the albino's stall empty paddy hadn't dreamed it all who you reckon it was miss fran asked the old cowhand pulling himself up with the watering trough for support i'm not sure paddy but suddenly fran stopped remember- ing her interrupted conversation with old tanya snide felton had been in the carnival tent and no doubt had recognized fran had he tried to in- sure her attendance at the night show in order to make the stealing of white arrow easier what is it miss fran exclaimed paddy watching the girl's white face that carnival outfit that's been camped in wagontire it was them i'm sure declared the girl snide felton and his son were out here only last week probably looking over the ground on the pretext of buying fran had snatched her saddle from the corral fence and thrown it on the little bay she'd ridden the day before there's only one thing to do paddy and that's to cut their trail before they get out of the country they won't travel the regular routes which means they'll probably follow down sand ridge and cross the alkali flats toward the san simeon badlands but miss fran you can't tackle them hombres alone i'll go along you're weaving on your feet pad- skyline trail  dy and in no condition to ride fran had already mounted turning for a last word but you can make it to the house and call sheriff bronson in wagontire tell him to cut down goose creek and meet me in the flats we'll pick up felton's trail there seems i ought to go along miss fran no paddy it's more important for you to stay here boyd hanley'll stop by this morning with his plane tell him what's happened and ask him to cruise over the country between here and the san simeons he can spot white arrow from the sky where it'd take a ground force a month in that rough country before old paddy could remon- strate further fran set spurs to flanks and went racing through the lazy q gate old paddy roused brush- ing a gnarled hand across dazed eyes fran had said to phone to sheriff bronson and at the rate she was travel ing bronson wouldn't more than have time to reach the flats and meet her paddy turned then suddenly stopped a slow stricture catching at his throat there in the damp dirt at his feet showed a bright gleam of metal the next moment he stooped and picked up a pair of tiny silver wings so it had been hanley there by the watering trough last night hanley who'd cracked down on him from be- hind paddy knew a sudden cold rage hanley in cahoots with that crooked carnival outfit playing up to fran so's to give snide and jud felton a chance to steal white arrow probably that story about a government seeding con- tract was all hooey and he'd come wingin in this mornin all mealy- mouthed and innocent to further throw em off the track but hanley wouldn't be dealing with fran this time han- ley'd find paddy mcgrew and sheriff bronson waiting with guns once they'd clipped that bird's wings they'd soon catch up with his pals sheriff bronson was in his office when paddy phoned what's that he shouted above the buzzing of the rural line that albino stole i'll be right out hold everything as paddy hung up the receiver his old jaw set implacably he oiled up his forty-five then went out to the front porch where he could watch down the section line road for the sheriff it was a clear morning bright and fresh with dew sparkling like jewels on the mead- ow grass yet paddy mcgrew saw none of it his thoughts being too engrossed with what lay ahead boyd hanley snide felton and jud felton a dirty trio of scoundrels who'd plotted to hornswoggle a fine girl like fran and then all at once paddy mcgrew stiffened there came the powerful hum of a motor overhead as boyd han- ley's plane zoomed into sight making for the little valley north of the house so hanley had come to call on fran again with an alacrity born of fury the old cowhand hitched up his gun- belt and set out on the valley path the flyer was coming in for a land- ing skimming over the smooth ground he brought the plane up into the wind then glided to a stop paddy rounding a last bend in the trail saw hanley climb from his cockpit as the propellor lost momentum somethin sort of romantic about them flyers the old cowhand mused grimly reckon fran couldn't help failin half in love with him boyd hanley was striding swiftly down the trail with wind lifting dark waving hair handsome even old paddy mcgrew must admit that yet it detracted nothing from his determina- tion stop right there hanley he snapped forty-five whipping up and start reachin for them clouds paddy what in hell boyd han- ley froze gray eyes wide why all the gunplay as if he didn't know hanley was sure a good actor all right no wonder he'd taken fran in i'm holdin you prisoner hanley  l lindley mulkey leastways till sheriff bronson gits here prisoner well i'll be hanged you will be all right snapped paddy less you loosen up mighty quick and tell sheriff bronson what them pals of your'n have done with white arrow the albino what-- as if yuh didn't know he was stole last night growled the old irishman caustically stolen you know damned well he was snapped paddy patience at an end and you needn't act so carnsarned innocent what's more if any harm comes to miss fran while she's trackin down them felton coyotes i'll settle with you myself law or no law boyd hanley's gray eyes narrowed you mean fran's trying to catch up with white arrow exactly snapped paddy mcgrew and if you think you'll git a chance't to warn snide and jud felton you're mistaken sheriff bronson'll be here any minute to take you into wagontire and you'll stay right there in jail till we git white arrow back boyd hanley suddenly straightened gray gaze fastened on a point beyond paddy mcgrew's shoulder but there's fran and white arrow now he ex- claimed just rounding the corner of the lazy q corral paddy mcgrew turned and in that moment a hundred and eighty pounds of corded sinew struck him paddy's gun exploded harmlessly into the ground then for the second time in twenty-four hours he went out like a light a horse and rider pounded through the lazy q gate leaving a plume of dust in their wake sheriff bronson swiftly the flyer picked up paddy mc- grew's limp body and dumped it into the rear cockpit of his plane a quick turn of the switch and propeller the engine roared hanley slipped into the pilot's seat and the next moment was skimming across the valley in a clean take-off higher and higher the plane lifted circling the lazy q buildings then zooming westward out of sight when fran left the lazy q she headed toward a low line of hills that lay like blue haze along the southern horizon here the country became rough and broken with scrub juniper and pine covering the higher slopes two miles farther on the hills merged into the alkali flats a shim- mering old lake bed from some pre- historic age here a vast unwrinkled sheet of gray alkali dust recorded ev- ery track left by man or beast and spread them like a pattern for all others to read fran cut a wide circle across the flats and finally found what she was looking for wagon tracks accompan- ied by two ridden and one led horse they came into the flats from the north yet at a different angle than she her- self had followed fran cast a swift glance in the direc- tion of wagontire but there was no sign of sheriff bronson perhaps he hadn't been in his office when paddy phoned in which case she'd better ride on in order to cut down the fel- tons lead when sheriff bronson reached the flats he'd see where her tracks merged with those of the carni- val outfit and follow pronto any west- erner could read that sign with his eyes shut fran knew she was making good time grimly overhauling the more cumbersome outfit ahead the bright sun wheeled like a golden disk across the sky topping the zenith then drop- ping toward the west still fran kept on prodding the little bay to faster pace now and then she glanced back- ward along her trail but when after- noon shadows lengthened across the hills there was still no sign of sheriff bronson the tracks of the carnival outfit showed fresh now fran knew they skyline trail  couldn't be more than an hour ahead her firm little chin set as she pulled her sixgun from its holster and made sure it was fully loaded dusk overtook the girl in a shallow valley cut by deep arroyas snide felton and his out- fit were still traveling west straight toward mule river ford beyond which they'd be safe in the san simeon bad- lands for years those badlands had been a favorite hiding place for thieves and rustlers there were countless hide- outs tiny springs in oasis-like ravines where a small gang could hole up in- definitely so well hidden they need not fear the law darkness came down swiftly yet still fran kept on and then suddenly she jerked the bay to a stop some distance ahead through screening trees she caught the glimmer of a campfire the girl's heart began to race she couldn't tackle that camp alone but she might slip up under cover of darkness and se- cure white arrow while the others slept fran tied her bay among scrub juni- pers and crept forward the pounding of her heart a clamor in her ears the top of the covered carnival wagon showed against a dark backdrop of trees between it and the fire moved old tanya busy at supper prepara- tions but that which riveted fran's gaze was snide felton at the front of the wagon where white arrow and two other horses munched grain from nose bags felton busy with paint can and brush was covering the arrow's beau- tiful white coat with drab gray fran's lips tightened so that was why the outfit had risked a campfire this first night felton needed its light to effect that camouflage from a dis- tance or the air white arrow would soon be just another horse his coat blending with surrounding rocks and brush a good thing she'd discovered fel- ton's trick thought fran she started to turn but suddenly a hard blunt ob- ject prodded the small of her back lift em hissed a voice as a hand clamped on her gun fran froze so intent had she been on snide felton that she'd forgotten about jud come along the latter chuckled exultantly pushing her toward the fire hey pa look what's caught up with us snide felton jerked erect pale eyes flaring so he spat you alone girlie she's alone snickered jud i been scoutin round the camp like you said finders keepers eh pa fran swung around brown eyes blaz- ing you don't dare keep me pris- oner who's a-goin to stop us sneered snide felton reckon we'll turn you loose to bring the law after us the girl was about to flare back to tell him that sheriff bronson was fol- lowing her that tomorrow boyd han- ley's plane would be scouring this coun- try from the sky and then she clamped small white teeth into lower lip better to keep still better to sub- mit peaceably and wait that night she lay in the wagon box one wrist linked to old tanya's the other to the heavy wagon wheel fran slept but little her thoughts busy with the morrow and that moment when sheriff bronson or boyd hanley would discover the carnival outfit traveling toward the badlands even with white arrow camouflaged boyd would inves- tigate and signal their location to bronson it was noon of the following day that the feltons halted in a deep arroyo with old tanya making coffee over a little oil stove in the back of the wagon not since that first night had snide felton risked a fire while they were on the move fran rode in the wagon jolting over rocks and ruts but at meal time she was allowed to walk about and help old tanya under the steady surveillance of snide and jud felton's eyes there was something in the latter's envelop-  l lindley mulkey ing stare that sent a chill through fran's heart thanks sweetheart he whispered once as she handed him a cup of cof- fee you n me are goin to git better acquainted once we hit the badlands fran's brown eyes hated him while a swift fear wakened in her breast why hadn't sheriff bronson come or boyd hanley a sudden staccato hum broke through the girl's thoughts a plane those others in the camp had frozen to attention all eyes fixed on the sky and then the plane circled into view sunlight glinting on silver wings tears started in fran's eyes her throat ached boyd she'd know that old crate anywhere swiftly the plane came on flying fairly low did she dare signal boyd fran caught at the bright scarf about her throat but in that moment snide felton's pale eyes met hers fran's hand dropped it didn't mat- ter she thought boyd couldn't fail to see them now he was at the upper end of the arroyo and now directly over- head fran watched breathlessly for that dip of his wings his invariable greeting to her but that signal did not come the plane continued on a steady even course passing overhead and on toward the southwest boyd hadn't seen them or if he had he'd figured the covered wagon and horses were some sheepherder's camp the girl turned and saw snide and jud felton exchange a cryptic satisfied glance an overwhelming worry claimed fran as the outfit once more got under way yet surely boyd would come back if he didn't    but fran thrust the thought away all afternoon they jolted over the rough trail stopping at dusk for sup- per snide and jud felton tended the horses while tanya lighted the little oil stove fran watched with bleak despairing eyes all at once the old woman turned pointing to the little tank on the stove then to a five-gallon oil can in the wagon empty you fill she said gutter- ally setting her box of matches on the tail-board of the wagon the girl rose to obey lifting off the stove tank and unscrewing the cap on the five-gallon can and then suddenly every nerve in her body tightened out of the southwest came the unmistak- able hum of boyd hanley's plane fran's heart leaped then sank like a leaden weight if boyd couldn't see them at noon he'd never spot them in the dusk a moment and the plane would be overhead suddenly an idea leaped full-formed into fran's mind she dropped the oil tank its contents gush- ing forth upon hard shale a match next from that box on the tail-board a swift rake against the iron wagon wheel and fran cast it blazing into the spilled kerosene a column of flame exploded upward into the dusk fran scarcely felt snide felton's fingers biting deep into her arms scarcely heard his curses her face was tipped up eyes straining to catch boyd's dipping wings signaling that he'd seen but that wing dip did not come for the second time that day fran watched the plane sail swift- ly out of sight crawling hours of darkness sleep- lessness despair fran lying with her wrist linked to that of old tanya shud- dered at the thought of the morrow by noon they'd reach the mule river ford once across it she must resign herself to jud felton's love-making with its ultimate hateful climax one against three she was entirely at their mercy snide felton roused old tanya at dawn twenty minutes later the outfit was again moving forward fran felt beaten whipped swaying there atop the wagon seat if only she had her gun    could die quickly cleanly but jud felton carried it in his belt a mute symbol of his power it was mid-morning when the outfit skyline trail  reached mule river a shallow sluggish stream winding between steep sand- stone bluffs beyond lay the san simeon badlands mysterious sinister mile on mile they stretched disappear- ing in distance snide felton's face wore a satisfied grin holed up in those hazy canyons he could take his time about disposing of the albino as for the girl well jud needed a wife as the wagon moved down a steep cut to the ford something in fran seemed to wither and die paddy and sheriff bronson had failed her but that which hurt most was boyd she'd been so sure so certain he'd come when she needed him in that moment all life seemed as ugly as those bleak ravines beyond mule river's murky waters jud felton spurred up beside the wagon nice place over there to honeymoon he leered nice and-- he didn't finish for suddenly a voice cracked through the midday quiet lift em you scum you're covered fran's agonized gaze jerked upward there on the bluff above the ford stood two grim figures paddy mcgrew and boyd hanley jud felton went for his gun but in that moment boyd's forty- five spat fire jud slumped from his saddle even as snide's and old tanya's hands lifted and then boyd was leap- ing down the bluff disarming and ty- ing the feltons while paddy kept them covered from above fran boyd there at the wagon wheel reaching up and then suddenly fran was in his arms her slender body shaken by sobs boyd carried her down to the water's edge and gently bathed her flushed tear-wet face you're all right dear they didn't hurt you no no choked the girl oh boyd i thought    that i didn't see you yesterday noon and last night you--you didn't dip your wings i was afraid to signal and maybe warn those varmints better to take em by surprise boyd smoothed back fran's red-gold curls tenderly you see after i kidnaped paddy    paddy yeah chuckled boyd softly old paddy got the idea it was me who'd conked him there by the lazy q wa- tering trough he even had sheriff bronson primed to nail me when i landed but when he said you'd gone out on white arrow's trail i knew there wasn't any time to waste in jail tryin to convince em of my inno- cence but paddy exclaimed fran whatever made him-- he found those little silver wings of mine there by the watering trough but when i got him up in the air i talked some sense into him i'd lost those wings in the carnival tent when i took in that show night before last reckon snide felton found em and planted them there by the trough he probably figured on killin two birds with one stone surmised boyd you see felton had tried to talk me into joinin his show do stunt flyin but after i met you that day in the valley i didn't want to leave the range till i knew if--if i had a chance a--a chance boyd whispered fran breathlessly to sign you on as co-pilot    for life sweetheart fran's misty eyes and trembling up- turned lips were boyd's answer an answer that was rudely interrupted by paddy mcgrew hi boyd here comes sheriff bronson straight on the course you laid him reckon we can turn this out- fit over to him now good boyd answered then to fran that leaves you and me free to take the skyline trail home sweetheart my plane's in a little flat downstream will you sign on oh boyd will i whispered fran once more surrendering soft lips and this time there was no interrup- tion cowboy lore leaves from a cowboy's sketch book by  walt mead prairie girl her name was ann reilly but at some of the community gatherings they called her little annie rooney a pretty little thing she was with wavy brown hair and the dancing blue eyes of the irish and always laughing even at herself just a mite of a thing too one hundred and five pounds of happiness for all her twenty years she was really nothing but a child and so poor that a little gingham dress from the dust-covered racks of clay bank's dilapidated general store looked to her like the gown of a fairy princess her family were hard pressed to make ends meet with eight hungry mouths to feed and all the drought had taken its toll and the family were clinging desperately to what little they had left it seemed to have hit them harder than most as is the way with some families any- thing they turned their hand to seemed never to pan out just right misfortune stalked them at ev- ery turn then fortune smiled upon ann in the buxom form of mrs davis who real- ly wore the trousers for the two dot outfit she needed a girl through the busy season and ann was so breathless with excitement and the prospects of earn- ing some money of her own that she could scarcely accept above a whisper five whole silver dollars a week only they called them cartwheels then why that could buy a girl like ann almost all the beautiful things in the whole world including the two-dollar gold- tinted locket and chain that had been gathering dust for months in clay bank's forlorn general store window so ann packed her few paltry be- longings in her mother's battered old cardboard suitcase and went to live in the big rambling white house that overlooked the yellowstone and which old man davis had built when as he put it he was in the chips he was far from being poverty stricken even now though mother nature had whittled him down some and the ex- perience rankled but he still held to a half-dozen riders and a buster in the breaking pens as for ann the poor girl didn't know how to act there at first after  cowboy lore  sleeping three in a bed as was the case at home suddenly having a big spacious bedroom all to herself proved too much even for a girl with her happy disposi- tion she cried herself to sleep the first night--tears of happiness mingled with a goodly slice of homesickness as well even a dugout can be home it was only natural that ann should come to know jeff best who was work- ing the breaking pens he often strolled up the path leading to the house for a cup of coffee leaving sev- eral three-year-olds in the corral to chew on snaffel bits with a chance to think things over jeff had a way with horses and some said with women too though i don't know about that at least he was handsome and dashing enough to stir the hearts of most wom- en i thought he'd been places too mexico the argentine and had even cowboyed some over in hawaii he knew all alaska and mining to hear him mrs davis sniffed at that one and remarked i never knew a cowpoke to do a hard day's work in his life jeff quite unabashed made it clear that it had been something of a lark at the time and he wasn't lookin fer work leastwise not a shovel job mr davis in the background as usu- al would often look upon jeff's empty cup after he had departed and remind martha that some day she might be a mite too flip with the fellow and he'd up and quit to which mrs davis would reply let him the woods are full of horse fighters but she knew otherwise it was all very thrilling to ann her face would go all pink and her eyes shiny when she poured his coffee she even mustered up enough courage to ask mrs davis if she might try her hand at a two-layer chocolate cake jeff had made the remark that it was really the only kind of cake he'd ever given a rip for reminded him of his moth- er he'd said she'd been watching him work his youngsters from her prim perch on a top rail when he'd said it with his head tilted back in that challenging way he had his eyes crinkled in a smile and ann had blushingly told him that it was her favorite cake too jeff kept right on with his work and his coffee and ann continued to please mrs davis with her culinary though it didn't take a sharp woman like mrs davis to see how events were shap- ing up quite well she knew what was going on in the girl's heart no one claims to know to what lengths the courtship of the bronco- buster might have gone even mrs davis was left in doubt in fact things happened so suddenly that it was sev- eral days before people could adjust themselves to the fact that jeff was gone and apparently for a long time at least that's what the grim-looking man with the star had said would like- ly be the case though he didn't state specifically the reason and no one asked him wyoming senorita by  marie de nervaud the story so far dolores de rio alcadero del rey with her maid maria has come from southern california to stay with her uncle bill granby crippled but mentally vigorous owner of the double bar x in wyoming she straightway meets and likes roy pelgren owner of the neighbor- ing lazy nine roy has been depressed be- cause color blindness has barred him from the air corps and because his girl bess huggins jilted him for a lieutenant but knowing dolores sends his spirits soaring all is not well on wyoming range a sabotage ring is systematically destroying cattle bill granby is bemoaning his help- lessness when his son jerry who is on the wild side comes home drunk and an- nounces that pike the foreman is also drunk--in the howling coyote saloon in hurricane gap unknown to her uncle dolores starts for hurricane gap after pike on route she eludes three men whom she overhears plot- ting against the double bar x sending pike off to the range she then heads for the sheriff's office to report what she had heard but is interrupted by art sampson the town banker with of all people diego orietra her fiancé from span- ish california diego locks her up in a hotel room and plans to force her to accompany him home but dolores escapes and again listens in on a conversation--this one be- tween the men she met on the range and art sampson she realizes they are all in the sabotage ring and so probably is diego she hurries to the sheriff's office but before she can tell her story to the deputy there a local tough barges in he kills the deputy steals papers which are evidence against the ring knocks dolores out and so arranges things that the signs will point to her as the murderer roy learns that dolores is absent from the ranch and rushes to town after her he finds her in the jail just coming to roy and sheriff tom crawford listen to her story and fantastic as it sounds even the sheriff believes her yet he knows he hasn't enough evidence to arrest sampson so he dolores and roy rig up a scheme to learn more from the banker sampson is persuaded to drive dolores home to her uncle's ranch and on the way she cleverly allays any suspicion he might have that she has linked him to the plotters she met on the range they are interrupted by bess huggins now a widow and after roy again telling dolores to keep away from her man after bess tears on samp-  son starts making love to dolores distaste- ful as this is dolores plays up to him until they reach the ranch but is unable to learn much from him roy and dolores now realize they are madly in love and plan to be married the next day meanwhile roy rides off to his range and dolores her uncle and maria all take much needed naps while the girl is sleeping in the porch hammock diego orie- tra creeps up dopes her with a hypodermic needle and absconds with her to southern california when she comes to she finds herself driving with diego along the south- ern california coast realizing once she is home her stern spanish father will never let her see roy again and that in any event diego must be thwarted in his traitorous plans she wrecks the car both diego and dolores are thrown out onto the sand of the pacific beach part five chapter xxiii where's dolores bill granby's ex- hausted nerves kept him in a stupor of sleep until supper time he was finally wakened by the per- sistent shaking of a brown wrinkled hand and maria's shrill voice go way vamouse avanti he opened one eye and glared at her then   marie de nervaud shook himself wider awake at her terri- fied expression what in hell's the matter now he growled getting himself hoisted up on one elbow he wrinkled his forehead trying to make head or tail of the tor- rent of spanish then straightened in alarm as he caught on to the main theme of her tirade gone dolores isn't here my god i wish that girl would stop pull- ing a disappearing act shut up for god's sake let me think his final yell brought maria to a trembling silence but she still kept her imploring hold on his arm a blind instinct to save himself from a repeti- tion of the scenes he had gone through last night with maria made him calm his excitement and hide his own alarm he nodded reassuringly sí sí bien--sí sí maria drew a long breath and asked a question which he gathered to mean did he know where dolores was again he nodded with a soothing sí--sí manana-- the terror went out of maria's eyes and she gave a great sigh of relief bill motioned her to go back to the kitchen and let out a stentorian call for jerry maria shook her head shrugged and threw out her hands nadie nadie not back yet eh bill granby frowned but still motioned maria away when she had finally backed out of the room he let out a relieved whew and settled back on his pillows to re- view this new development nadie he muttered an echo of maria's last word that must be no- body reckon that means pike hasn't showed up either damn it all i'm hanged if i'll spend another night alone with that screeching hyena a gleam of common sense broke through his despairing rumble of oaths there was no point in letting himself get in the state he had been in last night dolores had said the sheriff was coming out he had showed up evi- dently and wanted her to go in town with him she had probably left a note somewhere he was about to shout for maria then stopped himself no sense start- ing that up again if he got the idea across to her that he wanted her to look for a note she'd fall to the fact that he didn't know where dolores was and the screeching would begin all over again once more bill gave way to a pic- turesque vocabulary that ranged from curses on himself for not having a telephone to curses on jerry and pike for not getting back reverting finally to the one sensible solution which was that dolores had gone to town and left a note that he couldn't find until jerry or pike or some of the outfit came back to get him out of bed bill resigned himself to his inevitable role of in- action he ate the supper maria brought him then dropped off to fitful sleep by the time morning came and there was still no sign of jerry or pike bill's philosophic resignation had about reached the end of its rope he mo- tioned to maria to put down the break- fast tray she brought him hi get me out of this damn bed and into my chair to his grateful surprise maria proved to be stronger than she looked by the process of much gesticulating hauling and pulling she managed to get him into his chair now bring me that tray on the porch i'll wheel myself out maria nodded her understanding picked up the tray and went out ahead of him bill wheeled his chair through the living room eagerly scanning every possible place where a note might have been left acute disappointment swept over him at not finding any but he reso- lutely reasoned himself out of the growing anxiety that beat on his brain it couldn't be long now before dolores would show up or somebody he could send after her if she didn't he was just finishing his breakfast wyoming senorita  when the welcome sound of hoofbeats came from the pines another minute and a slender rider in blue jeans could be seen winding through the trees bill's thank god changed to an ejaculation of dismay as the girl came out into the open and headed for the house bess huggins what in hell was bringing her here instinctive caution narrowed bill granby's eyes as bess pulled her sweat- ing horse to a halt he had never had much use for bess and had less than ever since she had thrown roy over she made no effort to dismount but called an excited hi bill where's dolores bill's eyes narrowed still more she's not here right now what do you want her for not here bess was plainly star- tled at this news where is she search me bill studied her nerv- ous excitement gone off for an early morning ride i reckon which way did she go i'll ride out and meet her she might have taken any of a doz- en trails bill was anything but help- ful what's the excitement what do you want her for i--i've got to see her bess was obviously nonplussed at this turn of events i-- she hesitated then start- ed to dismount i'll wait for her make yourself at home bill said dryly it'll probably be a couple of hours or more oh i can't wait that long bess burst into a gasping little sob a terrible thing has happened bill roy has had an accident i--i don't know what happened but i found him there at the lazy nine he's delirious and keeps calling for dolores i -- i'm afraid he might die if she doesn't come to him will you--will you tell her the first minute she gets back wait a minute bill's first start of distress at this news was quickly super- seded by suspicion i don't see where dolores comes in she hardly knows roy that's what you think bess flashed out then leaned forward in her saddle her eyes filled with tears and her'breath coming fast i'm going to be frank with you bill i know you and all roy's friends have it in for me but i've paid for what i did my hus- band was killed and i've come back to roy i don't believe he really loves dolores but he's got a crush on her all that's beside the point now though she ended wildly dolores has got to come to him i flared out at her yesterday but she isn't the kind to hold that against me you'll tell her to come to the lazy nine won't you tell her to come as fast as she can make it i'll tell her what you say bill granby answered his face a non-com- mital mask sure you won't wait and see her yourself i must get back to roy bess let another sob break through then wheeled her horse and made for the pines for sometime bill granby stared at the spot where she had last disap- peared just what is she up to i won- der he mused uneasiness surging up in him at this new situation that whole story sounds darn fishy i'm hanged if i'll pass it on to dolores a groan broke off the soliloquy when was he going to have a chance to pass anything on to dolores or to keep anything from her for that mat- ter maria's sudden appearance brought an almost welcome diversion from the groaning anxiety of his thoughts he made out from her excited questioning that she wanted to know how soon do- lores would come now that manana was here he gave a soothing string of sí sí's that he was far from feeling and finally managed to get rid of her again the morning silence fell heav- ily around him to be broken at last by the distant clang of the ranch gate be- ing shut and the chug of a motor the fervent thank god that escaped bill's lips as he recognized the sheriff's  marie de nervaud flivver through the trees was no empty phrase weak with relief he moved as the car came toward him then fear gripped him once more why wasn't dolores in the front seat with tom where's dolores he cried he had to repeat his hoarse question twice before he could make the sheriff hear what's that tom crawford stopped short one foot on the ground the other on the running board what did you say my god i said where's dolores didn't you-- where's dolores the sheriff echoed what do you mean isn't she here with one bound he was up the steps do you mean to say she isn't here he ripped out an oath that puts me on the spot all right so she's vam- oused what the hell are you talking about bill granby roared she hasn't vamoused something's hap- pened to her i thought of course that she'd gone back to town with you yes- terday afternoon yesterday afternoon it was tom crawford's turn to roar she's been missing since yesterday afternoon why didn't you-- wait tom--wait bill breathed heavily and put his hand to his heart it isn't going to help to yell we'll only have that maria on our necks let me get this straight didn't you come out here yesterday afternoon i couldn't make it the sheriff an- swered i told dolores i expected to come but then i got delayed at all events i had the word of honor of this precious niece of yours that she wouldn't leave the ranch until i did come this morning i got the report on the gun those were her finger- prints all right not that i think she was the killer he added at bill's stricken look i don't but it'll be a hell of a job to prove it especially if she's run away she hasn't run away i tell you bill granby declared if she gave you her word she would stay here she would stay i'd stake my life on it tom there's foul play here what-- a yippee cut him short both men turned to see roy coming pellmell down the slope of the north pasture my god i knew all the time she was lying bill ejaculated who was lying the sheriff de- manded but before bill could answer roy was charging up to them with a joyful where's dolores chapter xxiv gone it seemed to roy as he came up at a hard gallop that years must have passed since he last saw that ranch house porch ever since the moment yesterday when he had turned to wave a farewell to do- lores emotion and a heady elation had flamed through him quickening him to an intensity of living he had never known before the sheer surprise and wonder of the fact that dolores actually loved him as he loved her keyed him to high exhila- ration it wasn't all fairy tale this business of love at first sight it could strike you out of a clear sky as it had struck him as thank heaven it had struck dolores every minute of these strenuous hours that roy had passed since he left her had been permeated waking or sleeping by dreams of her on first getting back to the lazy nine he had made himself snatch a few hours of much needed sleep his last waking thoughts had been the incredible real- ization that the next time he went to sleep in this room dolores would be beside him the glory of this thought vied with the glory of the sunset as once more in the saddle he raced across the mesa to the meeting place slim and he had agreed on twilight had been deepen- wyoming senorita  ing as he had finally caught up with the milling herd it had been hard to pull his thoughts back from the intox- icating subject of dolores but roy had felt a deep thankfulness as he saw his cattle safely down from the upper range slim had accepted roy's congratula- tions with a satisfied grunt reckon we're safe for one while i hope the double bar x outfit has had as good luck as we have how about my going over to see if they've made it down from the upper range roy had suggested and slim had readily fallen with the idea sure we're all set now i'm sending one of the boys back to the lazy nine tomorrow maybe if the double bar x is still havin trouble we could spare him to help em out i take it you'll be stickin around the ranch for a while instead of the bitterness that this re- mark would have brought to roy a few days ago a glow of happiness had radi- ated through him yeah i'll be sticking around he had gloated i've got to go to town tomorrow morning but after that you'll find me right at the lazy nine for bet- ter or worse slim had stared at roy as he had given a happy guffaw at his secret joke roy had continued to chuckle over it off and on after he had left slim and started for the double bar x ranch slim would get the surprise of his life all right when he came back to the ranch good luck had stayed with roy all that night of hard riding he had guessed fairly well about where the double bar x herd would be apt to be and pike's welcome had been a heartwarming reminder of the new and close connection between the two ranches golly roy but i'm plumb glad to see you i was hopin like hell that someone would show up so's i could send word to the old man that we're ok another two hours and we'll have the herd all safely down on the lower range i was too short-handed to send any of the boys back but you can tell bill we're practically out of danger i'll be glad to roy had answered then asked has jerry showed up jerry pike's disgusted grunt had been answer enough i got troubles a-plenty without addin jerry to em roy was thinking of this now as he rode up to the house and saw the fliv- ver and the sheriff he hoped jerry wasn't in a mess he pulled his horse to a halt and was about to call out again for dolores when he caught the expression of the two men on the porch waiting for him in a flash he was out of the saddle and up with them what's the matter his heart sank with sickening premonition what's happened to dolores nothing we hope bill's groan was anything but reassuring pipe down roy don't get that damn maria ex- cited tell me bill roy's tense low voice begged where is she he looked belligerently at the sheriff don't tell me you've run her in we don't know where she is tom crawford began she was here yester- day afternoon yesterday roy exploded for god's sake don't tell me she's been gone since yesterday and you've done noth- ing about it what are you doing here he turned fiercely on the sher- iff get going where the sheriff's solemn question froze roy in his tracks as he was about to leap for his horse coldly tom craw- ford added just what call have you roy to be taking charge in this high handed-- what call have i roy cut off his question with a hoarse anguished croak didn't dolores tell you he looked wildly at bill tell me what we were planning to get married this morning she can't be gone bill she can't he turned fiercely on the  marie de nervaud sheriff where's art sampson tom have you checked up on him my god why did you ever-- art sampson bill granby man- aged to produce a roar out of his stupe- faction then lowered his voice with a nervous glance toward the kitchen what in hell would art sampson have to do with it and what do you mean married are you crazy or am i i will be if we don't do something about-- now hold your horses roy the sheriff put a restraining hand on roy's arm suppose we get this straight we're not going to gain any time by going off half-cocked you say you and dolores had planned on getting married today kind of sudden wasn't it ever hear of love at first sight roy demanded well it was that way with us i figured the sooner dolores had the protection of a husband the better and i was right my god i'm going to town to see-- she didn't spend last night there the sheriff broke in i know that at least not at the hotel as to art samp- son i met him early this morning go- ing to the station he said he was off on a two weeks business trip and you let him go roy ex- ploded just how could i have stopped him the sheriff asked angrily but roy drowned him out don't you see he might have kid- naped dolores he might have her hidden away somewhere and he was establishing an alibi with you why didn't you have a deputy follow him let me get a word in bill gran- by roared why do you keep harping on art sampson just because he brought dolores home-- he broke off with an excited exclamation by golly seeing you two has driven bess huggins clear out of my head i'll bet there's a clue there he broke into an account of bess's sudden appearance and of her yarn about roy she was trying to get dolores away from the ranch he ended excitedly let me get this roy's voice had a steely ring bess said i was deliri- ous and calling for dolores why-- after a moment's musing he broke in with an impatient there's nothing to that just bess up to her tricks she has it in for me and she probably cooked this up to embarrass dolores by getting her over to the lazy nine then get even with me by spreading the word that she found her there i don't think bess would have been so excited at not finding dolores if that had been all there was to it bill granby disagreed she was plumb thrown off her keel i got the feeling she didn't want to leave a message with me but that she didn't know what else to do there's a clue there i tell you i'm not wasting any time with bess's monkeyshines roy said decisively my hunch is that we've got to track art sampson he turned to the sher- iff it's ok to tell bill the whole story now isn't it tom crawford hesitated then slowly nodded i reckon it is in as few words as possible he told bill the part of dolores story that he had made her promise to keep secret i thought it was safe enough to send her out with art so she could try to pump him for more evidence we could use against him especially with roy riding herd on them my god i'll never forgive myself if-- never mind about forgiving your- self roy broke in what are we go- ing to do you can telegraph ahead and see if art got off at any station can't you he's well enough known unless he was equipped with some disguise which i wouldn't put past him the sheriff was beginning when he broke off with a startled hello who's this they all turned to see a horseman come out from the pines he appar- ently glimpsed the sheriff's flivver almost threw his mount with a sudden jerk to his haunches then rightabout wyoming senorita  faced and made for the shelter of the woods again it's jerry bill exclaimed but not before roy had done his own recog- nizing of the flying figure even before bill had the words out roy was off the porch in his saddle and giving chase it was a matter of minutes only when by a clever outflanking movement roy caught up with jerry and grabbed his horse's bridle let go jerry's voice broke on a high adolescent squeak let go i say i'm not going to see the sheriff i'm not-- still holding the horse's bridle with one hand roy reached out and caught jerry's upraised arm with the other what do you know about dolores kidnapping he shot out dolores kidnaped even roy had to admit that the hor- ror and surprise in jerry's echo were genuine the color drained out of the boy's face and his brown eyes grew round and terrified you come back and come clean with anything you know roy dropped jerry's arm his mouth grim and his eyes hard it's damn well time you ran into the sheriff he made no attempt to answer jerry's hysterical questions but his hand still on the bridle brought both horses back to the porch at a fast trot i have a hunch jerry can give us some clue about art sampson roy declared sternly his hand on jerry's arm as they came up onto the porch spill it at the mention of art sampson's name jerry sagged abject terror was in his voice as roy jerked him relent- lessly forward no no i don't know a thing about art sampson i-- his eyes grew wild with the sudden memory of what roy had said about dolores words which obviously had been driven out of his head by his subsequent fright do- lores he gasped you don't--you don't really think she's kidnaped what do you think the sheriff's voice was like the lash of a whip she promised to stay here and she has been missing since yesterday after- noon if you had been home instead of-- jerry cut him short with a wild sob don't i'll tell everything i know-- everything if art sampson has done anything to dolores i don't care what he does to me i'll tell everything i know chapter xxv jerry comes clean get some brandy in the cupboard in the living room bill granby's voice was tragic in its depths of despair but steady as a rock he put a hand on jerry's arm where the boy had col- lapsed in a chair beside him and was sobbing hysterically i'm standing by you jerry he went on no matter what you've done but you've got to come clean son right from the begin- ning it may lead to our finding do- lores some of bill granby's strength seemed to flow into jerry and he made a desperate effort to control himself he gulped down the brandy roy brought him shuddered then threw back his head and looked straight into his father's eyes i'll come clean he said art will kill me--or worse--but i don't care it was a sordid story the beginning of jerry's association with the sabotage ring and the faces of roy and the two older men grew even more grim as they listened tom crawford made notes from time to time of what jerry was saying his excitement growing until he could no longer hold it in by god i've got enough here to get art sampson without needing any girl to testify about recognizing his voice you needn't worry about what he'll do to you jerry i'll have him in a good  marie de nervaud safe place until he's sent to a safer one when you catch him you mean roy reminded him grimly go on jerry do you know any hide-outs they might have taken dolores to i've just come from their principal one jerry answered she wasn't there last night that's one sure thing when i heard the sheriff was coming out here he threw a frightened side- long look at tom crawford i reck- oned i'd better light out ever since i heard bronc kenyon had been caught with those papers on him i've been about crazy i knew joe had given those papers to bronc when joe decid- ed to vamouse if the sheriff had read them i knew too my goose was cooked all right because my name was there in connection with last week's raid he gulped when he saw his father wince under these words i know he went on miserably i know how you feel dad but by play- ing in with art at least i was saving our herds they would have gone the way of the rest if i hadn't how do you figure that his father asked why art sampson himself when he got me in to this promised that the double bar x herds wouldn't be raid- ed he said i was protecting you by playing in with him not only now but later he said i was carving out a big future for myself when he and his ring took over the cattle industry of the country after the war was over oh he did did he the sheriff growled and you swallowed that you'll have to swallow it too be- fore long jerry retorted a flicker of spirit showing through his abject des- pair you're all living in a fool's para- dise figuring the u s is going to win this war art sampson is smart enough to know we can't win it and he has lined himself up with the ones that are going to come out on top after the axis has beaten europe and asia to a standstill--and art has inside informa- tion that it won't be long now--we'll have to do things their way they've got key men all picked out to take over the different industries in this country art sampson will handle all the cattle ranges in wyoming and montana and those of us who have helped him will be-- the damn swindling liar filling kids up with stuff like that bill granby's rage burst all bands of con- trol i'd like to get my two hands on him shut up bill the sheriff or- dered tersely what more did he say jerry he said helping to end the war quickly was being more patriotic in the end than dragging it out he said the sooner there wasn't enough for our army to eat the sooner they would stop fighting he said-- i don't give a damn what he said this time it was roy who broke in where's dolores my god every min- ute we're talking-- you're right the sheriff agreed if you'll just be patient a minute i'm coming to that who was in the hide- out jerry anyone jerry's face got even paler if that were possible yeah he groaned bronc kenyon was there he--a shudder ran over him--they gave him the third degree for being caught with those papers on him they said if cal hadn't got the papers back-- jerry clapped his hand over his mouth with a stricken realiza- tion of what he had given away no he didn't say that he cried wildly he didn't say that i'm getting mixed he said-- never mind making anything up jerry the sheriff's eyes gleamed you've given us the name of the kill- er of my deputy now go on i haven't jerry sobbed but his father's stern voice cut off his rising hysteria do you want us to find dolores what else did bronc say dolores name had a bracing effect on jerry's break in control i'll do any- wyoming senorita  thing to find her he gulped then forced himself to go on with his story they went farther than they meant to with bronc i reckon he was in too bad shape to go with them so they left him there by golly jerry's eyes started wide open with sudden blazing excitement i remember now bronc did say he overheard art and joe talk- ing after they thought he'd passed out he said they had a special fancy job on hand he started to tell me some- thing about it then gave me a funny look and shut up i'll bet you he heard them talking about dolores roy was hauling jerry to his feet be- fore he had stopped speaking come on get going and take us to that hide-out roy shouted to maria who came hob- bling out the door gazing from one to the other of the newcomers with terri- fied eyes bien bien roy soothed in answer to her shrill cry of mía senorita bien he repeated forcing a smile got coffee cafe he pointed to jerry and pan pronto get some bread and coffee in jerry bill roy added as maria made for the kitchen while tom and i bring up some fresh cayuses at last we've got something to go on there was little time for talking in the next few hours while the three men pushed their horses to the limit in their race against time jerry stood up under the strain better than roy had expected you don't think the kid is leading us on a wild-goose chase the sheriff had asked once motioning roy to fall back for a minute the thought of dolores danger will make him play straight roy an- swered positively he fell for her the way the rest of us have his voice was harsh and strained nothing but her disappearance would have made him come clean about art i'm sure of that reckon you're right the sheriff nodded once more roy and he streaked up beside jerry urging him to greater speed suppose art has come back jerry asked once that'll suit me fine the sheriff an- swered grimly i've got a sixgun for the beginning of that interview and handcuffs for the end of it how much further jerry another half-hour or so jerry pointed to a distant spur we round that and come into the canyon from this end it runs straight through and comes out the east side so you can reach it from hurricane gap too hav- ing two exits makes it mighty con- venient when at last they reached the land- slide of shale they left their horses and started the climb fifteen minutes later they were up and heading for the cleverly hidden entrance of the cave you go alone jerry in case any- one else is there the sheriff whis- pered roy and i will wait here where we can listen in to what bronc says to you look jerry paused miserably am i puttin a noose around bronc's neck tom crawford shook his head he'll have to pay for his folly just as you will both of you being such kids though i'll see it goes as easy as pos- sible with you coming clean with what you know will count in your favor a whole lot jerry nodded straightened his shoul- ders and pulled back the pile of brush a groan greeted his hi bronc then a surprised oath you back so soon what's up did you run into art or joe art jerry echoed i thought you said he was heading for montana that's what he thought but he got double crossed somewhere along the line the dame didn't show up the sheriff grabbed on to roy just in time to keep him from dashing into the cave at this unforeseen announce- ment what dame jerry asked  marie de nervaud hell i might as well tell you bronc let out an oath why should i help that torturing sampson bully to get what he wants art's got his eye on that california cousin of yours you were telling me about how do you know roy and tom exchanged a glance of approval at jerry's well acted excited surprise then strained their ears to hear every word i wasn't sure when you were here before bronc went on i knew art was after some dame and when you was telling me about the spanish beauty i kind of put two and two to- gether but i figured there was no use stickin my neck out so i kept mum i'm ready now though to throw a mon- key wrench in art's scheme what in hell are you getting at terry demanded like i told you i overheard joe and art talkin when they thought i'd passed out joe was trying to persuade art to let the girl wait until they'd got the raids finished but art was plumb burnin up with romance he had it all figured out so he'd be as safe as a church it appears there's a girl named bess who has it in for roy she was crazy-headed enough to do any- thing to get even--especially if it got this other dame off the range so art put her up to getting the spanish baby away from your ranch this morning and then joe and art were going to nab her art had it worked out foxy enough to make a point of havin the sheriff see him on his way to the early train and tellin him he was goin off to mon- tana on business for a couple of weeks then he was to rig up one of his dis- guises board the train and get off at the next flag station where cal would be waitin with a horse for him he laughed again breaking off with a curse of pain go on jerry added his own curse well joe and cal were here since you left the dame never showed up joe's fit to be tied because art won't give it up but swears he'll get the girl tonight joe and cal went to tell the other fellows the raids are off for a couple of nights god but i'd like to catch art sampson in a trap so would i jerry agreed excit- edly we-- and so would i bronc gave a frightened curse at the sheriff's voice and sudden appearance in the mouth of the cave what's more tom crawford add- ed as bronc star-ed at him in speech- less stupefaction we will bronc came out of his stupor to burst into shrill hysterical curses at jerry for bringing the sheriff there shut up bronc tom crawford ordered it's the luckiest thing that ever happened to you that jerry did bring me to this hide-out we're tak- ing you into town with us see and then we're going after art sampson but one thing i want clear or it will go mighty hard with you is this the truth what you've been telling jerry about art's plans for kidnaping do- lores and is it true that so far he has failed to do it it's true as far as i know bronc stammered i only know what joe and cal told me but i don't see why they'd make up such a yarn for my benefit they wouldn't roy charged in and joined them he winced as he saw the state of bronc's feet then added excitedly where-- let me do the questioning roy the sheriff broke in curtly you and jerry keep still while i get this straight you say bronc that art plans a kidnaping tonight that's what joe said there was no doubting that bronc was telling the truth ok tom crawford waved roy and jerry toward the opening of the cave i want to talk to you two out- side once there he motioned them away i don't want bronc to hear us he led the way out of earshot of the cave you're a prize dumbbell he turned wyoming senorita scornfully to roy just because you're in love with dolores you don't have to lose all your wits i don't want a soul to know dolores has disappeared i want art sampson to come there to- night to the double bar x for her and what's happening to dolores in the meantime roy groaned i don't give a damn about art sampson i want to know what could have hap- pened to dolores if art hasn't carried her off my god we can't just wait-- he broke off suddenly staring at some- thing bright on the ground under a thicket then made a pounce for it my god he straightened up his face drained of color his hands trembling as he held out a small gaudily colored match box it was smashed down at one end but still had in it tiny wax tapers the sheriff took it curiously what's that don't you see roy's voice was scarcely recognizable there are only two places you can buy those wax matches spain or mexico diego is i the one who has kidnaped dolores his face hardened to an iron expres- sionless mask i'm going after her tom crawford seized his arm as he started away from them wait a min- ute roy you don't know-- i do know roy's voice was as ex-

father's ranch he cast an uneasy eye to the west where the sun was about to sink beyond the watery horizon he would have preferred to arrive by day light but    the curious formation of a rocky point ahead caught his eye and he gave a sudden whew at the sharp pitch the road took beyond it speeding along the level stretch by the beach he was speculating on the width of that nar- row ribbon flung up against the stu- pendous cliffs when a great burst of smoke puffed up to be followed by the incredible sight of the road itself burst- ing into the air the next second came the deafening detonation of the ex- plosion roy came to a stop gazing in in- credulous stupefaction at a second burst of smoke and rock and dirt there was a second thundering roar then silence broken only by the gentle lap- ping of the waves on the beach beyond the dunes that lined the road shaken and still convinced that he must be dreaming roy got out of the car and walked a short distance down the road he had the feeling that the jagged gapping crater pitted into the cliff where a moment before a road had been must be a mirage but the boulders that continued to detach themselves from the edges of it and crash into the ocean below dispelled this hope it was real a section of the road was gone blown up before his eyes the words dolores had repeated that she had overheard in the hotel bed- room flashed to his mind

again proved futile with a groan roy headed his car around one of the dunes on the left of the road and drove it behind a cluster of the gnarled pines there he locked it and abandoned it plunging at once up the shallow opening of a canyon that widened out to a sandy triangle with a thin trickle of water flowing to the ocean the going at first was easy follow- ing up the creek bed but as the twi- light deepened the canyon narrowed to a seemingly impenetrable jungle of tough manzanita bushes and heaped boulders after taking a header or two on the slippery stones roy was forced to accept the inevitable to push on at night was the wildest folly it would net him nothing but possibly a broken leg if not a broken neck realizing that it was too risky even to try to retrace his way back to the car he picked out a fairly level spot by the creek and prepared to spend the night the exhaustion and strain of the last two days made him relax in spite of himself stretching out roy looked through the maze of leafy branches above him here and there the light of a star pene- trated and brought him a momentary comfort those same stars were shining on dolores at least he was within a few miles of

away once she was back in her own environment memory of dolores lips against his of the look in those deep eyes ban- ished his sudden fear it wasn't time that counted when a man and woman came together as he and dolores had the hypnotic rhythm of the wind through the trees and the soft envelop- ing darkness lulled roy's tired nerves to a doze and then to deep sleep how long he slept he never knew but all his life he was to remember his awaken- ing through his troubled dreams flares of light brought him to half conscious- ness and an excited foreigner jabbering completed the shattering of his rest he tried to sit up but found he could not move nor could he see anything through the blinding light that he stared into a sharp commanding voice said in spanish let him speak but first tie him securely in spite of roy's struggles against the many hands holding him he was rolled on one side and his wrists and ankles were securely bound with harsh horsehair riatas he was then jerked to a sitting position with his back against a tree before him he saw a striking looking older man in black riding breeches of a curious cut a black embroidered bolero sort of jacket and a broad black sombrero that kept his eyes and forehead in deep shadow with him were several vaqueros who stopped their chattering at the older man's peremptory gesture and stood back respectfully watching with ex- cited beady black eyes while he spoke to roy in slow stilted english what do you do here in this can- yon roy's impulsive desire to say it was none of his business gave way to better judgment at the expression of the  please mention newsstand fiction unit when answering advertisements wyoming senorita  stern hard mouth which was all he could see of the older man's face i am on my way to the alcadero del rey ranch he answered there was a quick exchange of ex- cited glances between the vaqueros but not the least flicker of any change of expression in the face of their leader and why are you going there roy hesitated while desperate al- ternatives raced through his mind the supposition had already come to him that this man might be dolores father himself on the other hand it might just as well be diego's father or one of the other of the ranch owners down here who were in with the sabotage ring not only his own safety but that of dolores and heaven only knew how many more might depend on the answer he gave i have news from senor del rey of his daughter dolores he said finally his eyes fixed on that straight uncom- promising mouth there was still no shift of expres- sion no change in the voice that asked what news that is for senor del rey roy's heart gave an excited leap as he took a daring plunge are you by any chance the father of senorita do- lores again roy was aware of the excite- ment running through the vaqueros but if the senor shared it he gave no sign as he replied i am asking questions not answer- ing them--senor the sarcasm of that senor brought home to roy how he must look for days now he had not had his clothes off nor had he even had a chance to shave since that far away morning which he had so joyfully anticipated as his wedding day his momentary confusion gave way to a quick burst of rage at the ignominy of his position blurring caution and common sense in a gust of anger the spanish californian hospitality seems to be mighty different from what it's cracked up to be he glanced from his bound wrists and ankles back to the black line of shadow through which he could feel if not see keen suspicious eyes studying him where do we go from here the senor made a brusque gesture of decision we will go i think where you will receive still more of our span- ish californian hospitality he spoke in spanish but roy was quick enough to catch the trap that was being laid for him he would be in a far better position to find out what was what if they thought he did not understand any spanish he presented a blank face and growled a disgusted i don't get that lingo say it in usa the senor repeated what he had said in english then gave a brusque order in spanish to the vaqueros once more roy felt himself mauled by many hands at least he had the satisfaction of hearing curses of pain as the vaqueros tried to dodge his thrashing about and left him a glanc- ing blow and a stab of pain at the back of roy's head put an end to his strug- gles and as far as he was concerned to him for the time being to he concluded in the next issue in the next issue up across texas beginning n new serial of the lough old trail-driving days by

get him single- handed dad took up the challenge but although he didn't know it the men in pensco formed a posse to ride after him my brother benny and i were alone on our ranch the following morning when dad pounded into the yard badly wounded with matt garson and another hombre close be- hind him as he collapsed at my feet before the kitchen stove i saw why he had tried to outrun them instead of shooting it out his right hand was blown to bits snatching dad's gun from its holster benny challenged matt garson and his pal as they rode into the yard they laughed loudly in reply and it was plain to see that they were coming in after dad benny raised the gun and pulled the trigger a look of amazed fury spread over the face of garson's pal and he tumbled backward just as garson sent a bullet into benny's body as he fell he whispered don't let him get dad sis then he lay still matt garson stood looking down at dad as he lay unconscious on the floor slowly he raised his gun in the distance i heard the sound of many horses the posse was coming but it would be too late to save dad it was left for me to stop him i seized a pan of hot grease that was sizzling on the stove and dashed it into matt garson's face he gave one agonized scream and i fainted both dad and benny recovered although both were badly wounded matt garson  amateur page  and his pal were buried up on boothill whether i

girl of pisces seems always to be serene but this outward show of serenity conceals a volatile temperamental nature she is sensi- tively fond of art and beauty and her capac- ity for detail inclines her to the more deli- cate things of life she makes an excellent homemaker a fine designer of clothes a conscientious com- munity worker her large sympathies and her strong beliefs make her invaluable in the war effort she would excell in nursery work that is attending the children of defense- working mothers she has a natural way with children and they respond to her quiet charm too she would make a sympathetic nurse and pisces meaning the sign of the two fish gives her a nautical leaning and often brings her extensive travels invari- ably she is endowed with exquisite grace being cautious by nature and even in- clined to be somewhat wary and afraid of big chances the pisces girl has good control of her own heart when she chooses her mate she knows exactly what she is doing and seldom falls into the emotional traps that await her more impetuous sisters perhaps her most enviable trait is her abil- ity to adjust herself to sudden changes in environment she need have no fears about changing her pattern of life she will be able always to leave one mode of life and enter happily upon another--a gift which makes her particularly valuable to her country in these days of sudden changes of life and oc- cupation being almost tireless her energy and her enthusiasm for whatever she is doing may be excessive and--a word of caution--she must learn not to overdo professor mari will
