bit of rangeland was loma carlyle's heritage but with it came a gang of traitorous thieving riders and then because loma was too lovely a thing to be left in such hands fate sent a stalwart young rancher to protect and cherish her chapter i new country on the rim of the great tableland which rose with mesa-like abruptness from the red hostile gulf of the durango desert and then swept away to the north in mighty undulations until it buried itself in the green timbered slopes of the cobalt mountains the little cavalcade of three horses came to a panting halt the trail up from the desert had been steep and winding and treacherous with it safely behind them the animals seemed to relax with the thankfulness of a precarious climb well completed the lone rider who bestrode the lead horse and led the two pack animals on a single running rope seemed to relax also and turned glad eyes on those dis- tant cool slopes which lay quiescent and brooding and enchanting under the bright pour of the sun loma carlyle had been envisioning the cobalt mountains for the past month and her first real view of them was not disappointing now face to face with their majesty she forgot the scorching weary miles of desert travel and the hair-raising climb to the rim of the tableland   ranch romances her tan solarmon stetson was swept off disclosing a head of sleek blue-black hair cunningly massed at the nape of her neck excitement built a fan of color in her cheeks and her eyes aston- ishingly blue shone under a like stim- ulus there they are buck she cried we'll camp on them tonight and to- morrow we'll be home think of it buck--no more sand and heat and al- kali no more sour water and bitter grass i can't wait to get there her mount a square-built sturdy little buckskin gelding rolled a lazy eye wob- bled his ears a few times and proceeded to doze he was quite willing to take his time and rest a bit but the girl's eagerness was not to be denied she donned her hat lifted the reins and buck stepped out obediently the pack animals shuffling along behind despite the direct impact of the sun the air was vastly different from that of the desert the added elevation of the tableland helped and there was a soft vagrant wind sweeping down from the cobalts crisp and invigorating and bearing a faint fragrance of balsam even buck noted the difference and un- consciously quickened his pace a half hour slid by the sun was slanting downward heading for a couch in the misty blue of the distant moun- tains where they curved a hundred miles distant to the west the first tim- ber was not far away now less than a mile and loma could pick out individ- ual trees giants which loomed above their fellows the last of the undulations of open land lay ahead higher and steeper than any of the rest and up this final slope the horses panted to the accompani- ment of creaking leather at the crest loma rose high in her stirrups to look over abruptly she settled back and reined buck to a quick halt she seemed to hesitate just a mo- ment before slipping from the saddle and dropping the reins to the ground then crouching she moved upward taking off her hat again at the very crest she lay flat on her stomach peer- ing through a handy clump of wild oat in the shallow swale beyond little more than a hundred yards distant from her own position were three riders two of them had their backs to her while the third was facing towards her something about their postures sent a queer gripping fear into loma's throat they were crouched in their saddles leaning forward their mutual gaze never wavering the horses of the two with their backs to the girl were mov- ing sidling slowly apart and then with startling speed the one who sat his horse alone spurred his mount to a rearing twist and raced off towards the timber hunched low in his saddle quick as the move was one of the other two was quicker his hand lifted and steadied there was a spurt of flame a flat thudding report and the fleeing rider went headlong from his saddle to lie a twisted blot upon the earth for a long moment loma did not breathe horror steeped in her veins at the cold-blooded maneuver she had just witnessed but this did not keep her immune to a sudden wave of white- hot anger she saw the other two rid- ers lift their horses to a run heading for the timber where the dusk was be- ginning to gather in thick purple shadows then she whirled raced back to buck jerked out her rifle and panted to the crest again the fleeing horsemen were close to cover now just a few jumps away swiftly the irate girl levered a cartridge into the chamber dropped on one knee and took the best aim she could the gun leaped in recoil and spanged its challenge across the world she saw one of the distant horses rear and lunge but it kept on going before she could shoot again both riders were out of sight in the timber careless and unthinking of her own safety loma rose to her feet and ran down into the swale towards the fallen man rifle still clenched in her hands she did not think of the chance that heritage of conflict  the other riders now safe in cover might turn and shoot evidently the fleeing men did not halt for loma reached the side of the victim unchallenged in any way she dropped on her knees beside him recoiling from the rapidly spreading crimson stain on his shirt he was lying on his face spread-eagled loma dropped her rifle and turned him over she saw a young- old face bronzed and hard-bitten gray beneath the deep tan shuddering she felt for a pulse there was none for the rider was dead loma sagged back her face white and stricken somehow she had not expected this he had been so full of surging life a moment before she grew dizzy and sick the world darkening before her eyes she might have fainted had not a harsh grim voice pounded suddenly upon her ears reach high quick--yuh dry-gulch- in rat claw the clouds subconsciously loma did as directed turning with trembling slowness to face this new threat she saw a rider there some ten yards distant a grizzle-haired eagle-featured rider whose cold bleak gaze seemed to cut right through her and whose right hand gripped a huge black gun that pointed with unwavering steadiness squarely at her heart for some reason she spoke almost stupidly he--he's dead she quav- ered they--they killed him the grizzled old rider stiffened his narrow eyes widening as he stared at her good gawd he ejaculated a woman momentarily the gun he held moved off line then jerked back to its original unwavering position steady he rasped don't try any tricks like that on me git on yore feet and back away from that rifle quick somehow loma mastered her trem- bling limbs enough to do as bidden there she stood biting her lips and clos- ing her eyes tight in a futile attempt to dam up the sudden tears she heard the pound of another horse approach- ing she heard an excited exclamation in a new voice a keener and younger voice than the other dad what is it why that's long andy is he daid so this young hell-cat says who shot him rumbled the older man she was jest-- loma's eyes jerked open blazing through the curtain of tears in indig- nant refutation i did not shoot him she cried hotly that's not true holy smokes so gasped the new arrival staring at loma he was tall and lithe and broad of shoulder with the same eagle-like features possessed by the older man loma met his look defiantly the young fellow jerked his gaze from her looking at the older man yuh say she shot andy he de- manded nothin else but son there was two shots not so awful far apart i was down yonder past the curve of the swale i come up slow not knowin jest what to expect i seen her runnin down towards pore andy her rifle ready for another shot if he showed signs of life she didn't hear me comin up be- hind her an i got the drop easy but i didn't think it was a woman i was coverin--not till she turned i didn't think any woman would pull a trick like this loma's tears were gone the blue of her eyes intensified until they were al- most purple hot denial suffused her she stamped her foot i tell you i didn't shoot him there were two others they-- don't lie to me growled the older man jest where are those other two his tone was contemptuous wait a minute dad broke in the young fellow let's listen to what she has to say maybe we've got some apologizin to do already loma's posture grew less tense i saw it all from up there she nodded towards the crest there were three of them that poor fellow there was  ranch romances facing the other two they had their backs to me they were spreading apart as though to get him be- tween them suddenly he spurred his horse to a whirling start and made a run for the timber they shot him then--brutally cold-bloodedly--in the back i saw red i guess anyway i ran back to my horse and got my rifle when i got where i could see again the two killers were racing for the timber--al- most in it i shot at them once and believe i creased one of their horses it acted like it then i ran down to see if i could help the rider they shot i had just found that he was dead when you came that's all--and it's true the older man laughed sarcastically a pretty yarn but too damn thin son yuh-- the younger man lifted his hand keep yore shirt on dad i can soon find out if she's telling the truth wait a minute he spurred his mount forward and began searching the ground in the rapidly fading light he soon struck the tracks where the killers had raced for the timber he went to the crest of the swale and looked over then he came back to the dead man and dis- mounted making a careful examination when he straightened up his hat came off i'm apologizin for dad an me miss he said quietly dad put that gun away she's told the truth andy's gun ain't on him first time i ever saw him without it an he wouldn't have made a run from no two men on this earth even if they had the drop on him--not if his gun was in the leather i don't understand all this but i'm shore the lady's on the square her out- fit is up yonder over the crest saddle hoss an two pack animals the old fellow gave in grudgingly that don't sound exactly regular either he growled why would any lone woman especially a young hand- some one like this gal be rammin around the country alone with a pack outfit mebbe she didn't do this killin but i'm bettin she's tryin to cover up somebody else's tracks she musta had a man with her bosh snorted the young fellow don't yuh think i know how to read sign better'n that i tell yuh she's given us the truth use yore haid he turned to loma i'm link san- derson--an this is my father called eagle by them who know him shore i'm sayin again that we're sorry we misjudged matters his lean hawkish features lit up with a disarming grin that loma responded to immediately i'm glad to know you she answered quietly my name's loma carlyle and i am heading for thunder city can you tell me how far it is too far for yuh to reach tonight he said promptly a good twelve miles at least unless yuh know the trails yuh'd be foolish to try for it in the dark i guessed as much she nodded i intended to camp for the night as soon as i could find water link sanderson frowned it's none of my business of course but this country ain't exactly safe for a lone girl to camp out in yuh'd better come on home with dad an me yuh'd be right welcome there's a easy trail from our outfit to thunder city an yuh could make the ride in tomorrow for a fractional second loma was on the point of accepting this invitation then her eyes went to the grim old cat- tleman who she felt was still viewing her with suspicion and her manner stiffened thanks but i'll be all right i've been camping alone every night for nearly a month i'm used to it--and i have my rifle i'm not afraid in the slightest young sanderson did not press his invitation he shrugged if yuh cut straight into the timber from here yuh'll pick up a meadow mebbe three hundred yards up the slope there's a spring at the upper end heritage of conflict  thanks again if you've no further objections i'll go after my horses and head for it i want to get located be- fore dark link shrugged again okeh in the mornin if yuh look over to the east from the meadow spring yuh'll see a pretty sizable ridge where the timber thins out on top it runs due north into the main range on top of that ridge is a trail follow it until yuh strike the mouth of bear creek canyon turn due east there an cut across the flank of the range about two miles an yuh'll run into the regular quarter circle s trail leadin to town turn left an yuh cain't miss thunder city thank you good-by loma picked up her rifle and climbed out of the swale to her horses standing patiently just where she left them she was much her old self again as far as being in control of her truant nerves but her exultation had died this vivid enchanting world had been smirched with the touch of violent death and the grim specter seemed to cling and mock her her face was sober as she placed the rifle in its boot and swung into the saddle lifting buck into a swing she moved down into the swale again and headed directly for the timber over on her right bulking dark in the purple dusk the sandersons stood be- side the dead man they had caught long andy's horse and were lifting the dead rider into the saddle looking back once more just before entering the timber loma saw them riding away to the east along the curving course of the fatal swale the next moment she was in the pungent blackness beneath the timber she found the meadow without any trouble and buck's own eager thirsty nose located the spring for her she dismounted and went expertly about making camp packs and saddles were removed and the three horses watered the pack animals alone she picketed in the midst of the luxurious grass below the overflow of the spring buck she let go free for she knew he would not stray dry fuel was abundant and she soon had a fire going she put on her bat- tered little coffee pot and while waiting for it to heat spread tarpaulin and blankets by the time the coffee was turning over she had bacon crisping in the pan and a small pad of camp bread browning before the flame she ate slowly and with relish at the same time her thoughts were busy with the fire crackling so briskly and cheerfully before her the fatal shooting episode seemed to take on an atmos- phere of unreality all was so peaceful now so still about the rim of the meadow the towering conifers nodded in slow ca- dence before the playful push of the night wind the air was keen and crisp and fragrant with the breath of the trees the winking stars were brilliant and warm and close human hate and conflict and all baseness seemed very far away now but loma did not allow the spell of the night to delude her too far she was hard-headed enough to know better as she washed her utensils she frowned she tried to recall what the two killers looked like for the notion had come to her that she would report the matter to the authorities as soon as she reached thunder city it was with some dismay that she realized she could not surely identify either of the men their backs had been towards her all the time and such had been the jumbled condition of her senses she had noted no identifying character- istics about their horses even had such characteristics existed all in all it was considerable of a puzzle to loma knowing so little of the why and wherefore of everything cer- tainly she had not enjoyed the part she had had to play and somehow she felt almost angry that her first impressions of the new country that was to be her home should have been shattered as they were  ranch romances chapter ii the eagle's chick when loma awoke the sun was in her eyes she lay for a mo- ment staring up into a golden sky blissfully content of a sudden she real- ized that a fire was crackling and that the air was heavy and fragrant with the aroma of coffee and sizzling bacon startled she sat upright and her eyes opened wide with amazement crouched over the fire wielding an expert fork on the bacon was none other than link sanderson his back was towards her but she recognized him instantly before she could catch her breath he spoke good morning miss carlyle sounded a pleasant drawl i'm beggin yore pardon for takin these liberties with yore grub but if yo're half as hungry as i am yuh'll forgive me how d'yuh like yore aigs--eyes open or shut eggs exclaimed the startled girl trying to master her confusion and sur- prise i had no eggs in my outfit she saw his wide shoulders shake as he chuckled i know it i brought em in from the ranch thought yuh might like some an i've made a mess of dough-gods that look pretty dang good even if i do say so myself loma's surprise gave way to a feel- ing of indignance how long had this drawling young fellow been around her camp anyway and what right had he to intrude in this fashion her tone was cold and full of censuring sarcasm i don't know about the eggs and dough-gods but certainly there is nothing wrong with your nerve is it the custom in this country to make so free and easy with other people's prop- erty well grinned link we folks try an be hospitable now don't waste this grand mornin rawhidin me my inten- tions are the best in the world i thought yuh'd be kinda tickled to find breakfast all hot an waitin when yuh woke up what say we eat first an then yuh can ride me bug-huntin after- wards how did yuh say yuh liked them aigs i didn't snapped loma but as long as you insist--leave the eyes open she slid out of the blankets and yawned pulled on her boots and with soap and towel unearthed from her sad- dle bags crossed to the spring the water was so cold it seemed electric and the rebound of it filled her with such a sense of glowing well-being that she found her anger and indignation dissipating fast as she toweled her face briskly she cautiously observed this rather forward young rider grudgingly she had to admit that he was good to look at his face was particularly fine the hawkishness of his profile gave him a look of intense brilliant virility the jaw showing strength and indomitable will it was the face of a fighter fearless intelligent and strong he was tanned to a mahog- any brown he were a blue woolen shirt and blue jeans over which were strapped flaring batwing chaps worn and use-scarred his boots were ex- pensive quilted ones and his spur rowels were taped loma scored a count in his favor for that evidently this man loved horses too much to punish them with naked rowels in stature he was tall with wide flat shoulders and the narrow hips of a rider about those hips sagged a car- tridge belt carrying a walnut-butted gun his neckerchief was a neutral shade his stetson black and pushed back far enough on his head to show an expanse of crisp brown hair she saw that his eyes were gray flawless clear and keen apparently he was not watching her in the slightest but he spoke suddenly with a humorous quirk on his lips and his words set the color to beating hotly in loma's cheeks shore hope i qualify under examina- tion he drawled but i warn yuh that looks can lie i'm ornery an pig- haided an lazy as all get-out indeed retorted loma i'm quite heritage of conflict  sure i'm not interested in the slightest my mistake he chuckled well let's eat grub's ready there was nothing wrong with the appetite of either of them and they ate with a relish neither spoke until the meal was finished then sanderson rolled a cigarette and inhaled gratefully i'll explain myself he stated after reachin home last night dad an me decided that we hadn't ought to have let yuh run the risk of campin here alone us knowin this country better than yuh so i grabbed a blanket an them aigs an came back i came jest close enough to make out the gleam of yore fire then i bedded down knowin that if yuh got into trouble i'd hear things goin on this mornin i sneaked in an started breakfast mebbe i hurt yore feelin's --but shore i didn't mean to loma was more mollified than she showed for truth and sincerity were in his tone and words but she persisted in her poise of chilliness i don't see why you believed me unable to take care of myself she declared i don't believe there was a thing to fear an i don't believe yuh believe what yuh jest said he returned coolly yuh saw a man shot down in cold blood last evenin those two yella curs who killed him are only part of the bad hom- bres who ride this country no tellin what might have happened if one of that stripe had been driftin an seen yore fire i ain't sayin but what yuh got plenty of spunk an can take care of yoreself most of the time but there's limits to all things i jest felt a heap more easy knowin i was close enough to help out in case yuh did have trouble loma smiled she knew he was right i'm sorry i was so grouchy she said it was really very nice and thoughtful of you thanks a lot and that break- fast was awfully good his answering grin was instantane- ous that's better--a heap better i knew yuh had plenty of common sense now i'm goin to ask a favor of yuh it ain't much to yuh but it's a lot to dad an me how about it it all depends cowboy make things a little clearer what is this favor why jest that yuh won't say nothin about that killin last evenin when yuh reach thunder city it wouldn't do no good anyhow an dad an me can fight our own battles we'd appreciate it a lot i see said loma thoughtfully you feel that you can administer your own law is that it i reckon we allus have supposing you found out who it was that did the shooting what would you do about it she was amazed startled--almost frightened at the look that swept over him in an instant the smiling person- able young rider was gone and in his place there was a man mature in action and thought his hawkish features set in lines of savage harshness almost cruelty and his gray eyes became icy sparks yuh'd be surprised he snapped long andy was a good hand honest an white an square-shootin somebody is goin to pay for his killin which reminds me of somethin else i want to ask yuh would yuh recognize either of them killers was yuh to see em again loma shook her head i don't be- lieve so she answered soberly i thought of that last night before going to sleep you see their backs were to me all the time and there was nothing about their broncos i could recall ex- cept that they looked dark in coloring i savvy muttered sanderson thoughtfully their broncs mighta been bays or chestnuts or blue roans-- or ten dozen shades in between which means they were exactly the same as a thousand other broncs wasn't there any words spoken or names called no that was what made it so ghastly if words were spoken they must have been very low i couldn't hear a thing i'm sorry i can't help you more there is nothing i'd rather see  ranch romances than those two brutes brought to jus- tice they will be declared link yuh said last night yuh thought yuh creased one of their broncs yes i'm really sure i did when i shot the animal lunged and reared as though the bullet had burned it some- where link got to his feet well that's somethin anyway i'll kinda go on a still hunt for a crippled hoss now i reckon yo're anxious to hit the trail i'll wash up these dishes an help yuh pack link got another surprise when it came to packing he had known a good many men who understood the intri- cacies of a properly thrown diamond hitch but loma carlyle was the first woman he had ever seen throw an ex- pert one he knew that he couldn't have done better himself this charming girl with her striking coloring of black hair and vivid blue eyes grew more amazing and rose high- er and higher in his estimation with every passing moment she was com- petent handsome and possessed of ex- traordinary courage for one of her sex this outfit shows a lot of hard use he ventured yuh've come quite a ways from lee's ferry link whistled as he stared at her clear across the wild hoss badlands an the durango desert she nodded i'm used to hardship i've had a lot of it link swept off his hat then mebbe yuh won't mind me sayin that yo're the gamest an most capable young lady i ever had the privilege of meetin loma colored but said nothing as she swung into her saddle and gathered up the lead rope link stepped back his hat still in his hands adios miss carlyle foller the directions i gave yuh last night an yuh can't miss thunder city my hoss is back where i bedded down i aim to pick up the trail of them two killers an foller it as far as i can but i ain't hopin for much mebbe yuh hit that hoss more center than yuh thought an it coulda played out somewhere along the line i'll take a look-see anyhow adios thunder city hardly fitted its sonorous name it lay in a long verdant meadow walled on all sides by the towering green of coniferous timber east and west this timber ran up and up in ridge and slope until it thinned out at snow-line above which reared half a mile more of mountain bare and precipitous for the most part but crowned at last with eternal snow these peaks called east cobalt and west cobalt were the absolute crests of the range to the north a stage road ran out of thunder city it wound along in lazy curves through the timber climbing slowly up to thunder pass whence it dropped down through zigzag and cut- back to the rolling rangeland beyond leading finally to the town of healy on the railroad forty-odd miles it was from thunder city to healy perhaps a dozen people were visible when loma carlyle rode in and every one of them stopped to stare at this vivid girl riding alone with her pack horses most of the spectators were men dressed in chaps sombreros and spurred boots but there was one stout matronly-looking woman of early mid- dle age seated in a home-made rocker on the porch of a tiny cabin and to her loma turned for information i wonder if you could tell me where i could find judge reynolds she asked smiling pleasantly the answering smile was genuine and motherly of course i imagine you'll find him in his office that is the third building up on your right if he isn't there stop at the blacksmith shop the judge and my man jim do an awful lot of arguing over politics thank you loma rode on dismounting before the building designated it was a large building given over in most part to a general store but one small corner of heritage of conflict  it held an office over the door of which hung a sign judge thomas reynolds attorney-at-law loma knocked at the door and en- tered at a brisk bidding before a bat- tered old desk sat a round white-haired rosy little man with twinkling eyes and cheery lips as he beheld loma he jumped to his feet bowing low i am happy to see you madam he chirruped i am judge reynolds what can i do for you i am loma carlyle she said quietly ah said the judge i am happy to see you won't you sit down loma took the chair offered and laid a packet of letters on the desk you'll desire proof of course she stated you'll find it in there the judge adjusted a pair of old-fash- ioned spectacles and buried his nose in the papers for ten minutes not a word was spoken then he looked up and nodded not a question he said i'm very glad you have come miss carlyle i feel now that i have discharged my debt to your uncle bert mannering was a very good friend of mine but i had begun despairing of locating you i'm sorry i was teaching school in a little out-of-the-way town in northern arizona it was only by merest chance that i ran across the personal advertise- ment in an old paper the judge rubbed his pudgy hands together better late than never he beamed tritely i suppose you wish to take over control of the inherited prop- erty immediately i'd like to i've come quite a dis- tance and i'd like to get settled as soon as possible very well it will take a few days to get the necessary paper work done but there is no need of your waiting around until then when all is in readi- ness i'll get word to you and you can drop in any time then to close the mat- ter up the ranch--your ranch now miss carlyle--lies southeast of town some fourteen miles it is a valuable inheritance and one of great future promise your uncle's registered brand is the bar c  i suppose you'll keep that yes nodded loma i see no rea- son to change if it was good enough for uncle bert it is good enough for me that's common sense approved the judge you'll find the ranch in good shape deuce coburn the foreman is a capable man and has been very con- scientious over his responsibility since your uncle's death they discussed matters for nearly an hour then loma thanked the judge and left outside the office she hesitated a mo- ment then headed for the wide dusky door of the store there were several personal purchases she wished to make a rider was coming along the street towards her his step was unsteady obviously he had been drinking his eyes bloodshot and set were fixed on loma and the impact of them sent a queer ripple of revulsion through her she hurried her steps to gain the open door but the rider anticipated the move and got there ahead of her he blocked her way teetering on his toes there was a depraved viciousness on his leering features drink-sodden and brutal loma tried to slip past him but he shot out a grimy hand and caught her by the shoulder not so fas sister he blurted not so fas lemme git a good look at yuh damn me fer a sheepherder if yuh ain't a li'l beauty c'mon smile fer me on the contrary loma's eyes turned violet and smoky with anger she had met drunken men before and had been accosted by them but never had one dared lay his hand on her this fellow's touch made her flesh creep she tried to jerk away but the grip on her shoul- der tightened the drunken leer became a grimace of anger so-o--tha's it eh the fellow snarled think yo're too good fer texas jack to talk to huh show yuh --bet i'll show yuh fer that yuh'll  ranch romances have to kish me fore i let yuh go loma's answer was purely reaction with her free hand she slapped him and such was the power of her lithe young strength the ruffian staggered back but his grip was maintained he cursed and dragged her towards him she fought him off frantically kicking and strug- gling dimly she sensed the approach of a running horse pounding down the street the animal came to a halt near- by and a saddle creaked the next mo- ment a human catapult flashed between loma and the drunk the impact threw her back against the wall of the store jarred and bewildered she saw the drunk reel a step or two then catch his balance spouting curses the curses broke off before the sodden spat of a hard-swung fist and the drunk went headlong where he lay in a sprawled motionless heap over him stood the wide-shouldered figure of link sanderson his face a cold relentless mask his eyes narrow and gleaming i oughta gun yuh where yuh lay yuh rotten coyote sanderson was growling i will next time i meet yuh --so help me i will from now on this range is too small for yuh an me texas jack suddenly link seemed to realize that his words were wasted for the rider was out cold he straightened up turned and faced loma his hat came off did he hurt yuh he demanded she shook her head no--no but-- she shuddered i understand said link he's a filthy brute who's been around these parts over-long i'll see to that little matter as soon as he snaps out of it the ominous purport of link's words steadied loma let's forget it she said quietly after all he wasn't really responsible it was the liquor in him not altogether snapped link he's jest naturally a crooked no-good polecat drunk or sober he's like the rest of that bar c  tribe there's a house-cleanin due an-- do you mean he rides for the bar c  broke in loma yeah but they're due to lose a hand today soon as he gets on his feet again i'm givin him his walkin papers i'll give him jest an hour after that if he's still around--well-- he left the sentence unfinished ominously so loma stiffened slightly what au- thority have you over the bar c  she demanded none--outside of this he tapped the gun swinging at his thigh but colonel colt is a powerful persuader at times this is gonna be one of them i allus used to think that bert manner- ing was a pretty level-haided sort of a feller but after lookin over that bunch of coyotes he put in charge of his ranch jest before he died i've had to revise my opinion they ain't fit for hell-room not one of em mannering musta been gettin childish in his old age loma's eyes were a smoky violet again of course i'm thanking you for what you did just now she stated coldly but you'll oblige me by keep- ing your opinions of my dead uncle to yourself as for him--she nodded towards the drunken rider who was be- ginning to stir again--i'll have him dis- charged immediately it was link sanderson's turn to be astounded he stared at her good lord he ejaculated bert manner- ing--yore uncle then you must be that heir that judge reynolds has been tryin so long to locate i am is there anything wrong in that but--but-- link stuttered aim- lessly good lord you--why yuh ain't figgerin on takin charge are yuh i am--immediately why not why not why not shucks it'd take me the rest of the day to tell yuh why yuh cain't i beg your pardon said loma stiffly i see no reason why i shouldn't judge reynolds tells me my title is absolutely clear the ranch is mine and i intend to run it heritage of conflict  but yuh get me wrong miss car- lyle link persisted seriously i ain't questionin yore ownership i'm sayin yuh cain't go out there alone some- body has got to go with yuh--some other woman yuh see-- loma shook her head i don't see why i shouldn't i'm quite able to take care of myself thank you again i'm obliged she nodded and pushed by him enter- ing the store for a long moment link stared after her then growling a low curse he turned to face the rider he had knocked out texas jack was sitting up now and the vacuousness of his ex- pression faded gradually he was fingering the gun at his belt but link stepped swiftly forward and jerked it away from him he thumbed open the loading gate of the weapon and jacked out the cartridges then he tossed the weapon back at its owner's feet yore time is up feller link growled this country is sick of the sight of yuh yuh got an hour to get out--not a second more i'll be in town that long next time yuh an me meet it's a showdown with the smoke a- rollin i've told yuh somethin turning on his heel link went to the door of judge reynolds office and en- tered without knocking texas jack watched him go then crawled to his feet sober now and with his depraved features a mask of hate he reloaded his gun slouched down the street and mounted a bronco roweling the animal cruelly as he went surging out of town judge reynolds looked up at link sanderson's abrupt entrance saw who it was and smiled pleasantly howdy link what brings you here i come in to tell yuh that yuh oughta have yore haid felt said link shortly the judge's merry eyes twinkled thanks for the suggestion being hu- man i make blunders and after some particularly bad blunder i've often thought i ought to myself what's wrong plenty what in the name of com- mon sense did yuh wanta send that car- lyle girl out to the bar c  spread alone for yuh oughta know better than that the judge laughed link you're an alarmist i'm quite sure she'll get along very well i differ snapped link she's haid- in for trouble shore as yo're a foot high yuh oughta've warned her off bosh you're like a small boy--see- ing goblins behind every tree i know you don't like deuce coburn but that doesn't alter the fact that he is a good man in his place--a mighty good man he's run that ranch right up to snuff since bert mannering's death i've been keeping a very close check on things and i can't find a single mistake his tallies are full and complete and show- ing a nice increase yes deuce is do- ing a good job mebbe growled link i wasn't referrin to the business side of things though my kick is that no girl spe- cially a young an pretty one like miss carlyle should be allowed out at that ranch alone good lord that bar c  crew is the hardest collection of nuts i ever saw on a ranch they ain't got no respect for gawd or man an deuce coburn ain't any better than the rest of em on the contrary observed the judge imperturbably i consider deuce a very reliable foreman granted that some of his riders are wild but deuce is quite capable of keeping them in their place no link you're whistling in the dark link shrugged and turned to the door have it yore own way judge mark my words though there'll come a time when yuh shore will go to an expert to have yore haid felt link slammed the door savagely and stood for a moment glowering down the street he saw loma carlyle leave the store with several small packages in her arms these she stowed away in her saddle bags mounted and rode out of town when the fringe of tim- ber had swallowed her up link prowled  ranch romances along frowning and thoughtful through the clear sparkling air re- sounded the clang of a blacksmith's busy hammer link's frown was replaced by a smile he hurried along to the little cabin where the kindly-faced woman still sat in her rocker he tipped his hat grin- ning boyishly howdy missis downs he greeted her perching himself on the low step at her feet yo're lookin mighty pert an handsome today stout mrs downs smiled fondly you young scalawag she retorted you don't fool me a bit you've got some scheme up your sleeve what is it out with it link twirled his hat in his lean strong bronzed hands well it's this- away missis downs bert mannering's heir has finally showed up judge rey- nolds has turned the bar c  over to her she-- she ejaculated the surprised lady do you mean to say that vivid girl with those wonderful eyes who was looking for the judge is bert manner- ing's heir well said link dreamily she shore has got wonderful eyes bluer than i ever thought eyes could be an they turn a sort of smoky violet when she gets mad yes'm i reckon that's her well now isn't that fine i'm aw- fully glad i liked that girl the mo- ment i saw her yes'm agreed link again so did i but missis downs she's gonna be out there all alone with that bunch of wild hombres that ride for the bar c  an i don't feel right easy in my mind about it now if there was another wo- man with her for a few days--a older woman--why mebbe them knot-haided bar c  peelers would realize that she's got friends here in town that are inter- ested in her an sorta keepin an eye open to see that she ain't bothered none mrs downs pursed her lips thought- fully there's something in what you say link she admitted i suppose you are hinting that i'm that elderly woman well sort of but link how would i ever get out there and back there isn't a chance of driving out in a buckboard and it's been years since i was on a horse link grinned impishly running his fingers through his hair well yuh know missis downs i been thinkin for some time that yuh oughta take up ridin again they do say it is swell ex- ercise for the figger an i know where i can rake up a quiet easy-ridin little bronc that yuh couldn't get off a walk with a stick of dynamite aunt molly downs laugh echoed merrily you scamp she cried i'm almost tempted but jim downs would be scandalized don't yuh worry about jim said link realizing that the victory was won i'll knot his tail if he gets ruc- tious i'll go get that bronc right away an i'll ride out most the way to the bar c  with yuh be back in a jiffy he loped away chuckling molly downs looked after him her eyes soft it's the sorrow of my life that god never sent me a son like you link san- derson she murmured chapter iii blotted brands the first glimpse loma carlyle had of her future home was more than favorable in fact it brought back to her an exultation akin to that she had experienced when first she glimpsed the charm and grandeur of the cobalt mountains the trail from town had wound along the southern slope of the mountains leading always east at first it had led for miles through solid unbroken aisles of timber where one rode in perpetual twilight but finally a change took place the timber thinned meadows enchanting in their luxurious green and smeared with slashes of wild flowers became more and more numerous the steady slope of the range gave way to broken coun- heritage of conflict  try that gradually leveled out until loma glimpsed ahead a tremendous valley shaped like a v one arm of the valley ran directly east the other stretched out to the south reaching down towards a great vague gulf of mist and harsh colors which she judged was the durango des- ert a central ridge lanced with tim- ber separated the two valleys which narrowed as they reached their apex until only a cut gulch connected them at one point the view of the valleys was extremely clear and here loma reined in momentarily all up and down the emerald expanse of the open ranges she could make out herds of grazing cattle the red backs and white faces of which shone resplendent in the clear crisp sunlight far down the southern arm was a group of toy-like cubes which loma identified as buildings but try as she would she could not make out anything of the sort in the eastern terrain until she had ridden some two miles farther on then of a sudden she saw the headquarters of the bar c  the buildings of the bar c  were numerous and all sizes beyond them was a maze of stake and rider corrals all corrals save one were empty and in this some score of horses were racing and twisting trying to escape the cun- ning ropes in the hands of two punch- ers outside that corral a portable forge was being operated by a third man while three others were working about a bronco that was thrown and hogtied the man at the forge was the first to see loma and he called a warning to the others who dropped their work im- mediately it seemed that they were full of suspicion and distrust for one of them openly stepped apart to pick up a win- chester rifle which he held in readiness in the hollow of his arm somewhat perturbed at this reception loma rode slowly forward one of the group spoke sharply to the others then strode out to meet her he was a big man tall and thickly built with enor- mous shoulders his skin was either swarthy or very heavily tanned and his face harshly featured loma was the first to speak and as her soft melodious tones struck his ear the rider stiffened in amazement how do you do she said i am loma carlye this i judge is the bar c  ranch the rider was so completely taken back he seemed momentarily bereft of speech he stared at her then he re- covered and swept off his sombrero this is the bar c  right enough miss so yo're miss carlyle eh shore i'm glad to see yuh i'm deuce coburn if yuh've talked to judge reynolds he probably mentioned my name his voice had a peculiar quality heavy slightly thick and with a touch of arrogance in it but he was patently trying to be agreeable and loma felt no resentment yes she nodded the judge spoke of you--and very favorably i see that you and the other riders are busy so don't let me interrupt your work just show me the main house and i'll look around and get settled later we'll talk matters over and become adjusted that's the main house--the one yon- der highest up the crick said coburn but first give the boys a chance to meet yuh hi gang come over here an say howdy to yore new boss miss loma carlyle as the riders approached loma re- membered that link sanderson had called them a bunch of human coyotes so she surveyed them curiously she was a trifle disturbed at their ap- pearance coburn was by far the most prepossessing of the lot to a man they were set of face hard and wild-looking with slouchy carriage and a baffling evasiveness of eye all carried guns two of them carrying two weapons apiece the holsters of which were tied down with buckskin thongs their ages were problematical miss carlyle boys introduced co- burn our new boss from now on her --ranch romances--first sept  ranch romances wish is yore order remember that dopey go up to the main house with miss carlyle an unpack for her put the stuff on the porch then take care of her broncs rest of yuh get back on the job he turned to loma yuh'll proba- bly find the place kinda upset it's been bachelors quarters for quite a time but soon as yuh see what yuh want done call dopey he'll swamp out for yuh loma nodded then essayed a little speech she had been rehearsing all the way out from town i want to run the ranch along the same general lines as uncle bert did men she told them i want to be fair and just in all mat- ters and if you will help me out i'm sure we'll all get along nicely coburn smiled boldly at her that's a up-an-down proposition miss car- lyle i'll speak for the boys we're with yuh to a finish the house as coburn warned showed plenty of signs of male occu- pancy it was dusty and disordered and in need of a thorough house-cleaning before dopey had even finished unpack- ing for her she saw that she was going to need help and plenty of it she told dopey so yes'm he nodded i reckoned yuh'd find things kinda tore up be with yuh soon as i git these broncs cared for he bowlegged his way off with the horses and loma gazed after him tell- ing herself that aside from texas jack this fellow was quite the most unpre- possessing individual she had ever chanced to meet he had lank tow hair hanging untidily about his ears and shirt collar his face held an unnatural pallor in a country where men were normally deeply bronzed his profile was a re- ceding one with buck teeth a weak chin and peculiar bulging frog-like eyes his clothes were badly worn and dis- tressingly untidy loma thought again of what link sanderson had said and she grew a lit- tle panicky but abruptly her slim shoulders stiffened and her head went up after all range work was hard work requiring the services of hard men and a cowboy who had been help- ing shoe refractory broncs in the dust and dirt and heat could hardly be ex- pected to appear immaculate any lingering doubts which might have persisted were soon banished be- fore a period of intense industry the homey sturdy log dwelling was swept and scrubbed from one end to the other walls were wiped down windows washed and the pile of odds and ends of equipment thrown out on the porch grew to amazing proportions the kitchen was given especial care and dopey worked as he hadn't worked in years loma indignant over the discovery of what seemed ten thousand dead ciga- rette butts scattered everywhere drove the perspiring puncher unmercifully pan after pan of water was heated used and thrown out dopey developed a crick in his back and his knees were sore from crawling over what seemed an acre of floor with scrubbing brush and bucket of soap suds men stated loma severely are natural-born pigs you'd think that the whole wide world was one big ash-can for them to throw their cigarette butts into and old boots--and socks--ugh yes'm agreed dopey meekly yes'm that's right eventually it was done just as aunt molly downs came ambling sedately up on a sleepy mild-looking pony loma met her at the door with mingled sur- prise and swift pleasure my dear explained aunt molly as she climbed stiffly from the saddle you've no idea what misery i've gone through to come on this visit so don't grow angry with me i'm just a poor fat woman so full of aches and pains i could scream goodness how good it is to get my feet on solid earth once more and that poor horse i'll bet he feels that the weight of all ages has been removed from his back she laughed then with genuine mer- heritage of conflict  riment and loma joined in a sudden rush of affection for this amiable soul gripped her and she welcomed aunt molly with genuine delight she real- ized now that a feeling of loneliness had been growing on her--loneliness for one of her own sex of course said molly i know who you are loma carlyle so that scamp link sanderson told me i'm mrs downs aunt molly to all my friends she eyed the pile of discarded equip- ment on the porch i see your femi- nine instincts to clean house have al- ready asserted themselves i hoped to get here in time to help men can be the most careless brutes they went inside arm in arm dopey seized the opportunity to get away and slouched down to the corrals leading aunt molly's pony the rest of the crew had just finished their job of shoe- ing as he came up he stared at them sourly pigs he muttered that's what yuh are a bunch of careless brutes and natural-born pigs she said so--an i figger she's right after all the muck i had to clean up goddlemighty i'm worked to a frazzle an to think that some folks hire out for that kind of a job link sanderson having parted with molly downs just above the apex of the two valleys rode down the south one at a leisurely lope he felt a lot better knowing that for the next few days at least the presence of mrs downs at the bar c  would keep the riders of that outfit subdued and by that time he gambled they would real- ize that it would be unwise and unsafe to molest loma carlyle link frankly admitted loma's charms she was unlike any girl he had ever met before good-looking proud and pos- sessed of a certain vibrant charm he could not fathom he only knew that the mere sight of her had set his pulses to throbbing and that from his very first look at her he had been unable to get her out of his mind he considered himself without any suggestion of ego to be pretty normal and sanely balanced with a stricter code of ethics than most men boasted and if loma carlyle's vivid beauty had so intrigued him what would it do to the wilder and more unprincipled riders she would perforce come in contact with link frowned at the thought a small group of grazing herefords scattered to let him pass and with the instinct of long habit his eyes ran over them noting their condition and num- ber his gaze fixed on one two-year-old and he reined in abruptly burned on that particular animal's flank was a bar c  brand which was in no way unusual in itself here at the head of the valleys cattle drifted back and forth bar c  stock mixing with his father's stuff and vice versa but to link's expert eye that brand did not look exactly right it seemed a little out of proportion and uneven not at all like the usually crisp outline from a stamp iron it might have been a mav- erick of course discovered by one of the bar c  riders and branded with a running iron still    he stared harder at the animal frowning his eyes narrowed in sud- den decision he unstrapped his riata from his saddle and ran out a noose he kneed his bronco into a run and swept down upon the startled two-year- old too late it scuttled for safety the rope hissed out writhing like a snake the loop flew true picking up both hind feet neatly the wise bronco stopped and braced the rope twanged tight and the startled animal feet cut from beneath it struck the ground with a thud while the pony kept the rope singing tight link knelt beside the panting whiteface and examined the brand very closely his finger tips sensitive and probing traced the mark when he finally stood up his face was harsh and stern his eyes cold as he rolled a cigarette his lips moved so-o that's it eh he muttered  ranch romances this particular brand will interest dad he went back to his horse mounted and slacked up on the rope the year- ling struggled to its feet kicked off the loop and started to run instantly link was after it coiling his rope as he rode he turned the animal and headed it down the valley towards home his pony seeming to understand what was wanted stayed close on the two-year- old's heels hazing it deftly along thwarting every attempt the whiteface made to dodge off to the side perhaps a mile had been covered in this fashion when out of the timber to the east a rider came loping he was heading at such an angle as to cut off link's progress link recognized the man instantly but his only sign of it was to loosen his gun in the holster some twenty yards distant the new- comer reined in he was a thin spidery-looking individual with hard jet eyes in a swarthy face those eyes went over the two-year-old in a set stare then fixed in unwinking intensity on link where yuh haidin with that two- year-old sanderson he demanded his voice thin and reedy i reckon yuh know glick link's answer was a cold drawl i suggest yuh turn it loose again yuh might be accused of rustlin an in this country a rustler is open game for the fust man who can get lead into him link's laugh was harsh he was staring straight into those beady orbs now his body smoothly tensed those are the truest words yuh ever spoke glick he retorted i know what yo're drivin at spin em when yo're ready spider glick's reaction to these words were movements as smooth and fast as light both hands flicked down and up and a twin report crashed across the silences it was a move that would have caught a more unwary man cold with a sen- tence of certain death for spider glick seldom missed at twenty yards this time however he did for the simple rea- son that link sanderson's body was not where it had been a split-second before at the slight settling move in the saddle glick had made before he went for his guns link had slithered far over in his saddle he hung practically out of sight on the off side of his horse holding his weight by knee hooked about the cantle and left hand locked to the horn glick's two slugs cut past where link's waist had been one of them low enough to slash the chap leg above his knee glick's guns made sheening arcs as he flipped them back caught the ham- mers with his hooked thumbs then threw down again as they came level link shot once from under his horse's neck the slug cut glick's mount just deep enough across the withers to cause the brute to drop to its knees partially stunned glick caught unawares as his mount dropped so suddenly was thrown for- ward on its neck he fought wildly to regain his balance snarling like a cor- nered wolf he was too slow how- ever for link pulled himself back into his saddle and drove an accurate slug into the viperish gunman's chest glick gasped and rolled to the ground beside his horse link waited a moment to make sure then dismounted and walked over glick was dead and link caught the rein of the horse just as it lurched to its feet again the hard relentless hawkish look was on link's face again as he stared down at the dead man lucky for me --unlucky for you glick he mur- mured but yuh didn't have me fooled yuh were out for my scalp whether i'd been bluffed out or not if yuh'd had yore winchester with yuh yuh'd plugged me from the timber i got no false idees about yuh glick--an no re- grets he reloaded his colt scanned the sur- rounding country to make sure no friend of glick's was in the vicinity then lifted the dead man into his own heritage of conflict  saddle tying him there with a thong the reins he looped over the saddle horn then he turned the animal until it was headed towards the convergence of the two valleys and hit it a cut with his quirt it went off at a run with its gruesome burden swinging astride link picked up the two-year-old once more and resumed his way hazing it before him a half hour later he had the whiteface in one of the quarter circle s corrals an amiable-faced puncher appeared in the bunkhouse doorway go get dad sleepy called link i got some- thin here to show him by the time old eagle sanderson ap- peared link had roped and hogtied the luckless whiteface what's up son rumbled eagle as he climbed into the corral plenty was the succinct reply take a look at that brand see if it tells yuh the same story it tells me the old cattleman examined the brand with minute care when he stood up and faced link his face was cold and savage where'd yuh find that crit- ter he snapped up at the haid of the valley the brand seemed kinda funny to me so i roped the brute and looked it over then i brought it home on the way i run into spider glick eagle stiffened sharply and cursed the devil what happened we shot it out said link quietly what yuh shot it out with spider glick seein yuh there all in one piece that's hard to believe son link showed the leg of his chaps where giick's lead had ripped it but what did he do then de- manded eagle quit shootin jest about said link i out-foxed him an got him center the old man stared at his son with wide eyes yuh mean yuh killed spi- der glick shore yuh didn't shoot him in the back did yuh link flushed but his gaze was steady i'm a sanderson dad he answered we don't shoot men in the back a grim smile twitched at the old man's lips and high pride gleamed in his eyes i'm apologizin lad but shore knowin glick--an knowin yuh --well-- i savvy nodded link giick's never been shaded before but there's allus a first time dad i happened to be the man to do it eagle sanderson stared out across the sunlit world his face sobering again son he said takin the life of a fel- low man is serious business i don't want any son of mine to develop into a killer but sometimes it is a case of kill or be killed an i know this was one of them life's thataway in this country yuh may have to rock off more men before yuh die i expect yuh will seein the turn things are takin right now but i hope it'll always be a case of self- defense with yuh it always will be dad said link quietly eagle shook his boy's hand i sired a man son i'm proud of yuh now i reckon we better pay deuce co- burn a visit i wanta see how he'll ex- plain that blotted brand we'll take the whiteface along with us but there's the grub call we better eat first chapter iv molly downs--amazon after the house-cleaning was complete loma carlyle's first move was to heat up a huge tub of water and take a thoroughly satisfying scrub on dressing again instead of the jeans and shirt she donned a simple gingham dress that she brought to light from one of the packs these garments changed her appearance amazingly and heightened her femininity and charm molly downs exclaimed with delight over her child you're delicious stunning why you'll have these simple cowboys completely out of their minds i'm warning you just watch them moon around loma colored and laughed they'll  ranch romances find me pretty practical i imagine i haven't any time for such foolishness mrs downs shrugged i've heard that story before my dear when the right man comes along--well wait and see you're exaggerating terribly pro- tested loma i haven't seen any of them yet who appeared greatly taken consider dopey that wretch who scrubbed out the house for me i'm quite sure he'll hate me for the rest of my life i bossed him dreadfully i know one of them who is badly struck right now teased mrs downs when some young man confides to me that a certain girl's eyes are bluer than he ever thought eyes could be and added that those same eyes turned a smoky violet when their owner became angry--why i'd say that young man was quite impressed loma's color deepened and she changed the subject i'm starving let's get something to eat by the time the meal was finished the two of them were very good friends indeed the straightforwardness of the elder woman wholesome and cheery loma found very stimulating and full of comfort they had finished their meal and were sitting quietly talking when a raucous yell of rage and anger sounded down by the corrals it cut through the peaceful moment like the blood- hungry scream of some predatory animal and the sound of it sent a chill up loma's spine while her cheeks paled what is that she gasped molly downs had heard that sound before in her life and always it pre- saged violence and battle and sudden death it was the voice of a man gripped in insensate killing rage she did not answer loma but scuttled to the porch loma was right at her heels down by the corrals they saw the bar c  riders grouped about a horse across the saddle hung a limp ghastly figure molly downs knew and turned to shoo the girl back into the house but loma's shoulders were straight and though the pallor in her face had deepened there was determination in the blue eyes that brooked no interfer- ence i'm going down she said quietly it must be one of my riders i've got to know she approached the group running as she neared it vicious rage-filled curses seared her ears it was deuce coburn who saw her first and snapped out a command that quieted the others he turned and faced her i wouldn't go no nearer miss car- lyle he said gruffly his face flushed his eyes flaming i'll tell yuh about it it's spider glick one of our boys he--he's dead asked loma yeah daid as a mackerel he's been shot somebody'll pay for this an pay plenty i got a hunch who's respon- sible the boys are gonna back-track the hoss and find out we'll make em plenty sick they cain't get away with it they whom do you mean those damned sandersons--father an son bit out coburn they're overdue we'll settle the whole argu- ment--now he would have turned away but loma caught his arm no she said spiritedly i'll have no feud talk this is my ranch and what i say goes you're not sure who did this and you're not sure of the cir- cumstances any one of you who makes some move without my orders is discharged i mean it unconsciously loma had raised her voice and it carried far the group split open as a short wide bowlegged rider pushed violently through loma's first impression was that she had never seen such a maddened depraved-look- ing human before he had feral eyes set deep under a sloping narrow brow eyes that glinted as red as those of a weasel on the kill some heavy blow in the past had broken the fellow's nose and it spread thick against his face with pig-like flaring nostrils heritage of conflict  his mouth was a narrow venomous gash snarling and working his throat and hands and wrists were hairy like those of an ape two big guns sagged at his thighs tied down his voice when he finally got words past his twisted lips held the same horrible fury that had sounded in that first blood-curdling yell what's that he barked we cain't go run down the polecat who did this yuh say we cain't hell try an stop me--try an stop me no lily-faced dame can tell joe colinga what to do they killed spider--killed my pal damn em an i'm gonna get em an shoot their hearts out fire me if yuh want to hell with the job i wouldn't work for no outfit that ain't got the guts to fight for its own men i'll settle this job myself loma quailed before the fellow's fury she couldn't help it she thought of some mad slavering animal coburn caught colinga by the arm trying to talk to him but the ape-like rider jerked violently away and ran in- to the bunkhouse to appear almost im- mediately with a winchester rifle into the loading gate of which he was stuf- fing cartridges coburn turned to loma shrugging she caught him up with a straight scornful glance you're supposed to be foreman of this ranch she cried if you are stop that man stop him --or go with him don't be a fool growled coburn roughly colinga is on the kill yuh cain't reason with him now if i tried to he'd gun me i've seen him this way once before an he's right in one thing we ain't worth much if we cain't right for our own punchers but he doesn't know argued loma helplessly he doesn't know who did it he might shoot some innocent per- son not him that's one thing about joe his first wildness will work off in a minute after that he'll turn wolf --all wolf he'll ferret out the trail if it takes him six months in the end he'll get his man see--he's calmin down already this was true colinga had quit his mad jerkiness of movement and was saddling up almost calmly but this change to loma held an even worse threat than his initial wild outburst and then a fresh yell from one of the punchers turned all eyes to a new phase of movement cantering slowly down the valley came the sandersons eagle and link before them trotted a badly blown whiteface two-year-old eagle had his right hand up palm fore- most in the age-old sign of the fron- tier he wanted to parley intense excitement gripped the bar c  riders they milled around un- certainly joe colinga noting what was going on came prowling forward leaving his rifle leaning against the cor- ral fence loma with sudden decision advanced to meet the two riders slowly almost grudgingly it seemed deuce coburn slouched at her heels but molly downs totally unnoticed by anyone slipped over to the corral caught up colinga's rifle and with it held from sight in back of her ample figure moved quietly up until she stood just behind the gun's owner the sandersons reined in coburn rumbled eagle we got somethin to show yuh link rope that critter link swept down upon the steer which tried to run but for the third time in as many hours it was upset violently by an unerring rope what's the idee growled coburn i've saw critters roped an throwed before eagle paid no attention to this at- tempt at sarcasm take a look at that brand i'm anxious to hear yore expla- nation coburn hesitated running the tip of his tongue along his lips it was loma who stepped forward mr sander- son she said evenly as owner of the bar c  suppose you let me look at the brand what's wrong with it eagle stared at her grudging admi- ration showed in his deep eyes if  ranch romances yuh know anythin about brands yuh'll soon find cut miss but if yuh really want me to say so i'll tell yuh that brand was originally a quarter circle s it's been blotted to a bar c --an a botched job it is too loma's breath quickened as she bent over the steer if what eagle sander- son said was true here was a very seri- ous situation indeed and she did know something about brands--enough to discern quickly through touch and visual scrutiny that sanderson had stated the case she straightened up and turned on coburn mr sanderson is right she said coolly how do you explain this mr coburn i don't know nothin about it growled the foreman plainly discon- certed if yuh say it's true i believe yuh but it don't hold that i did it or any of the rest of our boys mebbe it's a plant that somebody pulled to try an start trouble between the sandersons an us or mebbe it's a frame-up don't lie coburn barked old eagle his eyes flashing that kind of talk won't get yuh anywhere i ex- pected yuh'd say yuh didn't know any- thin about it the same holds true for yore whole damned crew but i wanted to show yuh that link an me got our eyes open an here's a warn- ing for yuh if this happens again i'm holdin yuh personally responsible --an i'm comin after yuh coburn shrugged his shoulders in a show of bravado any time--any place sanderson right now if yo're feelin that way eagle laughed harshly tough--an brave ain't yuh--with yore whole pack behind yuh i've noticed yuh sing damned low when yo're alone but that's aside from the main ques- tion i come over here to lay the cyards on the table--face up yuh know jest how we stand now c'mon link we'll be goin jest a minute--you two these words came from the edge of the group of riders a few yards back of loma and coburn loma turned and saw joe colinga there discolored teeth bared in a snarl squat body crouched hairy brutal hands dangling and clutching close to his guns jest a minute he repeated i'm askin you a question what d'yuh know about spider glick bein wiped out it was link who answered as much as you do about long andy bein mur- dered colinga colinga's answer to that was a rau- cous curse and his hands blurred downward he was fast much faster than the average but at that moment a stout keen-eyed matronly woman was faster aunt molly downs watch- ing colinga like a cat would watch a mouse swept the gunman's winchester out from behind her and with the same movement whacked the barrel em- phatically along the side of his bullet head colinga went down in a heap take that you filthy brute snapped aunt molly stepping back levering in a cartridge and then level- ing the rifle at the startled and as- tounded group of bar c  punchers i'll shoot the first one of you to make a crooked move for a moment dead silence reigned then link sanderson laughed soft and drawling missis downs he chuckled my hat's plumb off to yuh that was the neatest thing i ever saw yuh shore patted that jasper down yuh either put a dent in his haid or yuh bent that rifle barrel anyhow me an dad are thankin yuh anythin we got is yores i'm gonna shake hands with jim downs every time i meet him he's shore to be congratulated dad we better be rammin out of here missis downs holds the fort adios the sandersons whirled their horses and rode away but link before he left looked directly into loma's wide eyes bowed tipped his hat and smiled and to a man aside from the unconscious colinga the bar c  stood and watched them out of sight heritage of conflict  that evening deuce coburn came up to the house and asked to speak to loma aunt molly let him into the living room and took a chair to hear what was going on coburn was plainly ill at ease what is it you wish asked loma quietly why i jest wanted to tell yuh that i fired colinga blurted the foreman his eyes downcast he had no business goin on the prod like he did so i got rid of him i talked it over with the other boys an they figgered i was right in doin it they also asked me to tell yuh that they're plumb satisfied with their jobs here an want to keep em they'll toe the scratch an obey yore orders without a question nat- urally we were all kinda het up about glick bein killed but in thinkin it over we figger that whoever rocked him off musta had a good reason spider was a trouble hunter he jest took on a hombre he couldn't handle i see said loma but i've a ques- tion to ask how do you explain that blotted brand the sandersons showed us coburn shrugged i cain't i got an idee though if yuh care to hear it i would well i been thinkin that mebbe glick did it yuh see a couple of weeks ago him an me had a run-in of sorts i put him in his place but i know he's been sore about it he was a good hater glick was i figger he blotted that brand with the idee of let- tin the sandersons find it so they'd be on my neck about it which they was mebbe while he was steerin the critter out where it'd shore be found he run into either eagle sanderson or his son they musta called glick an beat him to the draw which he shore had comin to him if my idee is correct sooner or later colinga is goin to start somethin with the sandersons an i don't want him a member of the bar c  crew if he does it don't pay to fight with yore neighbors no it doesn't agreed loma but i heard you say out there today that the sandersons needed cleaning out as you put it what basis have you for such a statement coburn looked uncomfortable put it down that i was jest mad at the time an not thinkin like i ought to run- nin a ranch in this country is no snap yuh got plenty of troubles an yuh got to fight for what yuh get an then fight harder to hang onto it a feller cain't be blamed for swallerin his haid once in a while very well said loma we'll for- get it for the time we'll see how the future turns out you may tell the men you are all on trial if you behave yourselves and do as you are told you'll be kept on but the first defi- ance of my authority will mean imme- diate dismissal here is one ironbound order that must not be violated leave the sandersons alone understand okeh with me miss carlyle de- clared coburn in relief thanks a lot i'll tell the boys an see that yore or- ders are carried out g'night as the door closed loma turned on aunt molly triumphantly you see fundamentally coburn and the other riders are all right i won't have any trouble with them they're anxious to please aunt molly snorted bosh child use your head i've known deuce co- burn a sight longer than you have it isn't in him to turn so low an humble unless he's scheming something an the rest are just like him you want to watch out for trouble it's in the air i can smell it loma sobered let's talk of some- thing else i'll have bad dreams as it is chapter v cards off the bottom the following morning loma donned her riding togs again and set out to look over her newly acquired domain she would have liked to have  ranch romances molly downs accompany her but that worthy lady begged off don't mention a saddle to me again for a few days at least honey groaned mrs downs i'm so stiff and sore now i could scream so loma rode out alone and headed down the valley it was a beautiful day and eight hours of sound sleep the night before had done much to dissi- pate the depressing aftermath of spider glick's killing while not having been raised on a cattle ranch loma had sufficient judg- ment and common sense to know that her inheritance constituted an ideal range water was unlimited the feed was luxurious and heavy and timber offered secure shelter at all times of the year also due to the conformity of the country cattle would not stray very far from their initial range loma traversed the entire length of the valley marveling at its extent eventually she reached the lower end of it where it fell away rapidly in a great slope towards the southeast there was a section of tableland again and beyond that the durango desert se- lecting the peak of a grassy knoll she dismounted ground-reined her pony and squatted cross-legged on the grass staring out into the blazing infinity to the south she was vaguely troubled just be- fore going to bed the previous night she had looked through a lot of old tally sheets dated a few weeks before her uncle's death a hasty calculation showed that slightly in excess of four thousand head of stock were then car- rying the bar c  brand in her ride down the valley she had made a rough count of the cattle she passed and the best she could make of it was around twenty-five hundred so she was won- dering perhaps half an hour passed in si- lence then her bronco lifted its head and with pricked ears looked down the long slope of tableland loma follow- ing the look of the horse saw a rider down there jogging slowly along scru- tinizing the few head of cattle that were there loma recognized link sander- son her first thought was to take her mount and slip back out of sight before link saw her but this quickly passed and a rebellious glow built up in her link was plainly checking up on bar c  cattle evidently he was on the search for more blotted brands loma felt somehow that his implication was that she was a thief the color in her cheeks mounted as with quick deci- sion she swung into her saddle and can- tered down to meet him when she came up he doffed his hat and smiled howdy neighbor he greeted her fine mornin ain't it it will do replied loma coldly what brings you here just takin a look-see at some more brands link admitted findin that other one sorta made me curious any luck she took no trouble to hide the sneer that came unbidden to her tongue link looked at her very steadily some he drawled quietly fourteen by exact count the arrogance went out of loma fourteen she gasped you're cer- tain of that pretty shore my eyes are right good loma was scarlet but she stood to her guns i'm very sorry she mur- mured that puts me in the position of being a thief doesn't it not at all--not at all reassured link staunchly but it's time you an me had a good talk let's light down an take it easy suiting the words to action link dis- mounted rolled a cigarette then stretched his long lithe carcass on the grass loma hesitated but a moment before climbing down and sitting beside him well she demanded i'm gonna talk straight out said link briefly an please understand that what i say is for yore own good i know yo're proud an a mite stubborn heritage of conflict  besides but down deep yuh got plenty of good common sense thank you said loma some of her old stiffness returning suppose we dispense with the personalities and get down to facts i imagine you are going to warn me about deuce coburn again everybody except judge reynolds seems to have it in for coburn link laughed softly yuh can fool some folks but yuh cain't fool em all if it'll make yuh feel better i won't say a word about coburn i'll jest tell yuh somethin of what has been goin on an yuh can judge for yoreself first off dad an me have been figgerin lately that some of our stock was missin jest how many haid we cain't tell until we look over our stuff at the spring round-up which starts next week but we're shore we been losin some we never did before--not while bert man- nering was alive we allus got along good with bert he was a square- shooter findin that blotted brand yes- terday sorta pointed the way an what i've seen today just about cinches mat- ters in other words cried loma the bar c  has been rustling some of your stock no said link gravely not the bar c --which is you but the men who are ridin for the bar c  shore enough are but why should they do it how can they benefit i own the ranch-- and none of them ever saw me before yesterday morning they owe me noth- ing why should they steal for me i thought of that admitted link slowly an could only find one answer tell me have yuh any idee how many cattle was carryin the bar c  iron when yore uncle died why--yes i think so i looked over some tally sheets last night and i ar- rived at a rough figure of something over four thousand head that oughta be about right nodded link thoughtfully it might be illu- minatin to have a range count made now somethin tells me there wouldn't be near that many by a long sight loma paled slightly what you mean is that deuce coburn and my other riders have been stealing from me as well as you is that it exactly they probably figgered that judge reynolds would be a long time findin the heir to the bar c -- which he was durin that time they intended to sell off the bar c  stock an pocket the proceeds in that case why didn't they make one big round-up and clean the whole ranch out at one stroke because they mighta had a lot of trouble disposin of the stock four thousand haid is a sizable herd of cat- tle it would have been sure to start talk no matter where they drove to an yuh cain't allus find a buyer right off who can handle a herd of that size but by sellin a couple hundred haid at a time they could do it an they been doin it loma was fighting against this rea- soning though something told her that this lean bronzed young fellow was hit- ting squarely at the truth of matters how about the figures coburn has been furnishing judge reynolds link laughed quietly any liar can figger the judge claims he's been checkin up on coburn very carefully yeah he has--by figgers that coburn has been furnishin him nothin is easier than jugglin a tally sheet any fool can put down normal increase per- centage if he knows cattle at all--an i'll give coburn credit for knowin cattle all right the judge means well an he's a hon- est ole coot but the only way to check up coburn's figgers is to make a thor- ough range count which the judge couldn't do if he tried loma surprised link i believe you are right she admitted gravely i rode down the valley this morning checking up on the cattle i saw i do not claim to know a great deal about cattle raising but if there are four thou- sand head of cattle on my range i don't know where they are  ranch romances link straightened rolling another cig- arette now we can get down to brass tacks he exclaimed in satisfaction coburn has been stealin yore cattle he's been blottin our brand into yores an stealin our stuff too we got to think up a way to put a noose around that jasper's neck loma shivered don't talk that way we've had enough of death already and by the way did you kill spider glick link nodded his eyes narrowing yeah it was him or me he figgered he had me cold but his string played out the wrong way and your conscience doesn't bother you not a bit i'm moral shore that him an colinga killed long andy when we got andy home the other night we looked him over an found rope burns on his arms we savvy now how they got his gun off him they roped him from some sort of ambush disarmed him then plain murdered him d'yuh expect me to feel sorry for rockin off a human coyote who'd do such a thing hardly an one of these days i'm liable to look colinga over in smoke she looked at him soberly he was staring off into the distance his keen- featured face set and implacable loma thought that she had never met such a proud resolute capable-looking man be- fore and she had to admit his attrac- tiveness--the clean hardy fiber of him with abounding virility her heart quickened slightly and color crept into her cheeks if what you surmise is true i cannot blame you for feeling as you do she admitted quietly and i hope you do not think that i would sanction anything crooked on my ranch link looked at her his eyes softening the only thing i can think about yuh is that yo're the gamest proudest finest little lady i ever knew we're gonna be friends you an me--good friends but yo're up against a crooked deck an yo're gonna need help to handle the play my first idee was to tell yuh to fire yore crew--all of em but i think yuh'd bet- ter hold on to em for a while we'll give that smart rooster co- burn a little more rope an mebbe he'll hang hisself i'm goin on a trip for a few days to check up when i get back i'll let yuh know how we'll act what say we meet here again about--lemme see--say next saturday that'll gimme four days very well i'll be here promised loma link held out his hand let's shake on that pardner there was a caressing note about his last word and loma felt her cheeks burn hotly but she shook hands link's palm tightened about hers and he looked deep into her eyes blue and shining yeah he murmured we're gonna be friends--mebbe more loma fled she sent her horse up the slope at a run and did not look back until she reached the mouth of the val- ley even here her pride told her not to look back but her heart told her oth- erwise--and won the argument link stood just as she had left him looking after her she could not make out his features but he waved his hat and loma waved back glad that the friendly distance hid the luminosity of her glance and the wild throbbing of her heart then she spurred onward out of sight she enjoyed riding back to the ranch house a great deal more than she had leaving it and her thoughts were not about cattle or the troubles that faced her at all instead they were all of link sanderson he's nice buck she whispered to her pony i like him awfully well but that is a secret between you and me un- derstand you rascal buck wobbled his ears lazily it was okeh with him link sanderson rode directly back to the quarter circle s ranch where he selected a fresh mount saddled and then went up to the ranch heritage of conflict  house he filled a couple of canteens stuffed a pair of saddle bags with food and rolled up a blanket with this meager outfit plus a booted winchester rifle he went back to his horse and strapped the equipment to his saddle as he finished his father came over from beyond the bunkhouse where he had been superintending the reset- ting of the tires on the round-up chuck wagon where yuh haidin link he asked noting the blanket and saddle bags down buckeye way was the an- swer be gone for a couple of days i reckon what's doin there don't know yet but i expect a-plenty located fourteen of our brands that had been run to a bar c  this mornin what the word was a stentorian roar that could have been heard half a mile away fourteen goddlemighty yuh jest forget about buckeye we'll get the boys together an go over an clean out that bar c  crowd to the last man fourteen yuh say why-- why-- eagle sanderson began to sputter aimlessly so great was his anger link smiled grimly and waited until his father had calmed down a trifle we'll leave coburn an his crowd alone for a while he drawled finally we don't want to fly off the handle jest yet lord only knows how many more of our brands they've altered that's what i aim to find out besides that i'm convinced they've been lootin the bar c  ever since bert manner- ing died and link proceeded to tell his father his and loma's suspicions as i see it he continued coburn's been jugglin the figgers he's furnished judge reynolds with while drivin the bar c  herd out bit by bit an sellin em somewhere shore he couldn't have brought em out through thunder city an the pass down to healy like bert mannering used to do an like we do that'd been a daid give-away there's only one other way he could have moved an disposed of them that's by way of buckeye so i'm goin down to buckeye to see what i can find out when i get back i expect to be loaded with enough dynamite to blow coburn an his gang sky-high eagle sanderson thought this over for a moment glowering at the ground he nodded slowly that's sound rea- sonin he admitted i reckon he wouldn't have a heap of trouble gettin rid of em in that country but be careful son keep yore tracks cov- ered an don't ride the tops of any ridges don't worry i won't dad adios they shook hands and link rode away he headed directly south straight for the tableland that separated the timber-clad range and the durango desert reaching this he turned east and set his mount to that steady shuf- fling ground-eating jog which covers an amazing amount of country without un- due fatigue to either horse or rider he made a dry camp that night and long before daylight he was up again eastward he kept heading skirting the neutral zone between the desert and the cobalts with the rising of the sun he became interested in the ground he was traversing almost immediately he murmured in satisfaction the sandy earth showed indubitable signs of the passage of considerable herds of cattle there was no really fresh sign nothing that wasn't at least two weeks old but link was satisfied just before noon the country began to change the desert was pushed back farther and farther to the south and west by a stretch of rolling well grassed terrain across which link began to see scattered herds of stock he passed these closely studied the brands but saw nothing out of the ordinary the two most in evidence were a wineglass and a rafter o ahead showed a low twisting line of scrub willow beside a welcome pool of water link unsaddled for an hour al- lowing his mount the luxury of a good drink a roll and a feed of grass for  ranch romances himself he munched a cold flapjack or two about mid-afternoon he struck the town of buckeye it was a ramshackle raw-boarded sort of place spraddled around a single dusty street link halted and dismounted at a building before which several saddle animals were tethered a sign over the door identified the place as being the sunset saloon link entered casually leaned on the bar and had a glass of none too cold beer while he drank this he looked around five men sat at a card table engrossed in draw poker one of them dressed in store clothes with a pallid sphinx-like face link identified as a professional gambler the other four were riders clad in range togs one of these four was patently younger than the others--a boy of little more than twenty so link judged also in addition to being young this player was far from sober not a bad-looking youngster link de- cided with his smooth brown cheeks curly yellow hair and blue eyes--eyes that were hot and bloodshot now though his mouth and chin were not as much weak as they were wilful the young rider had just lost another pot which the gambler was impassively raking in the boy swore reaching down in his jeans for more money damn it he growled his voice thick from the liquor he had imbibed ain't there a hand i can hold that'll win i had a queen high straight that time an it wasn't worth shucks smythe yuh shore yo're dealin em straight up at this link saw the gambler stiffen while he stared at the boy with cold unwinking eyes his right hand started stealing inside the left flap of his black coat link dropped his hand to his own gun and was about to say something when the player next to smythe a coarse-featured dark-browed individual jabbed the gambler with his elbow forget it he growled with what was meant for a conciliatory smile don't pay no attention to johnny he's jest kid enough to say more than he means besides it's the liquor in him talkin an his luck has been lousy he ain't won a single pot me i'd be sore too but his luck'll change pretty quick deal em up pasco link watching closely saw the speak- er's left eyelid droop ever so little and the gambler relaxed okeh he said thinly but don't make any more cracks like that bidwell i deal cards on the square the tension died away and the game went on link turned to see the bar- tender a fat red-faced sulky-looking sort eyeing him speculatively link laughed softly seemed for a minute like there mighta been fireworks he drawled an a lot of em would have been comin yore way amigo had yuh gone ahaid an butted in like yuh made the move to do grunted the dispenser of drinks yo're a stranger so i'll give yuh a little tip buckeye is one hell of a good town to mind yore own business in a chill spark came into link's clear gray eyes though his smile still lin- gered so-o mebbe yo're right he protested mildly but the kid is half drunk an i never did cotton to seein somebody sneak a gun on a half-drunk kid least of all some tinhorn gambler don't worry yoreself over me feller i cut my eye-teeth quite some time back the bartender chilled clear to his heels by that spark in link's eye sub- sided and began polishing glasses indus- triously link hitched up his belt and strolled over to the card table standing behind the boy's chair the boy looked up met link's friendly grin and smiled in return hi stranger he greeted stick right where yuh are will yuh mebbe yuh'll change my luck which it shore could stand mebbe i will nodded link i'll give yuh all the moral support i got that this arrangement was not en- tirely suitable to the other players heritage of conflict  showed in the scowls they bent upon link but he paid no attention to them as he rolled and lighted a casual ciga- rette the game went on and as it pro- gressed link's eyes grew colder and colder while his face took on that pe- culiar hawkish ruthlessness that loma carlyle had so often noted there was a reason for it link was boiling inside for he was witnessing the most bare-faced piece of crooked sharp- ing he had ever run across the other four players were plainly in cahoots and the boy was the victim they were rob- bing him blind link sanderson was old enough and wise enough in the ways of the cattle country to know that minding one's own business is generally the safest course but he possessed certain codes that ruled him sternly one of those codes was being violated right now and he was determined whatever the outcome might be to assert himself smythe the gambler had just dealt the boy picked up his hand squinted at it and tried to hide his exultation the pot was opened by the man on smythe's left the coarse-featured fellow and was jumped in turn by the other two the boy kicked it again you fellers are gonna have to pay to see this hand he grinned foolishly smythe and the next two saw the raise the man on the boy's right saw it and raised again the boy met the raise and kicked it once more i'm loaded this time he warned the others scowled but met the raise cards snapped smythe the boy looked up at link showing his hand they're gonna get a spurrin this time--what he grinned link nodded thoughtfully they will if yuh draw right he drawled looking hard at the boy's blue eyes i wouldn't bob to that ace it never pays draw two is my advice the boy stared at link blankly for the hand he held was a full house kings on sixes there was no sign of an ace in it but suddenly far back in those blue orbs a glimmer of understanding showed he nodded reckon yo're right amigo i was gonna bob that ace but i'll try yore advice this time my judgment seems to have been rotten gimme two smythe he tossed the pair of sixes into the discard smythe hesitated and link smiled grimly the gambler met link's glance if yo're so anxious to have a say about this game feller he rasped why don't yuh buy chips an sit in if i did that stack in front of yuh would get smaller fast retorted link easily go ahaid--the kid asked for two give em to him smythe licked his lips fumbled at the cards and flicked out two of the paste- boards don't pick em up kid snapped link sharply his gray eyes boring at the gambler give him two more--off the top this time the ensuing stillness could have been cut with a knife smythe looked mur- derous yuh didn't figger the kid would draw did yuh smythe murmured link softly yuh knew he had a pat full house yuh gave it to him a-purpose but his drawin two upsets yore own hand them two would have given yuh fours enough to have beat the pat hand yuh dealt him so yuh tried to slip him two off the bottom he don't want them he wants top cyards give em to him the last words cracked like a whip and smythe cursing thickly did as he was bid his own hand he threw into the discard i thought this was a fair open game of poker he sneered but it looks like a hold-up right both times barked link the kid thought it was a square game but it wasn't it was a hold-up with you engineerin things an the rest of these coyotes helpin out yore dirty play the next moment was furious brutal action smythe's hand licked under his coat like the head of a striking snake it came out filled with blue cold metal as it appeared link's own gun lashed  ranch romances up and down in a flashing arc the heavy barrel landed crushingly across smythe's face breaking his nose and beating him to the floor in a senseless heap the coarse-featured man hancock was about to shoot when link drove a slug through his right shoulder and he toppled to the floor mouthing epithets the other two pasco and jardine spun out of their chairs snatching guns for the first stunning moment the boy had sat still his liquor-dazed brain refusing to work but now he lurched to his feet fumbling at his belt link poised and ready saw pasco pulling down squarely on the boy's heart and he threw a slug with lightning swift- ness it was a center shot cutting the fel- low down in his tracks pasco spun as he fell instinctively shooting the lance of flame from his gun almost seared jardine's face and that worthy went down with him a blank empty look on his face a bullet hole just under his right eye then link whirled towards the bar drop it he barked the bartender dropped the sawed-off shotgun of awesome bore that he had caught up from under the bar gawd gasped that worthy don't shoot--don't shoot i'm peaceable yo're a yellow-backed liar an a cow- ard bit out link put yore paws on the bar an keep em there silence fell except for the groaning of the coarse-featured rider whose shoul- der link had smashed the others were still the boy coughed in the swirling gunsmoke he looked at link cold sober i reckon i owe yuh one pardner he mumbled they'd have got me shore pasco was holdin daid on when yuh plugged him link nodded crisply yeah yuh owe me one i'll exact payment later jest now we got other things to think about how much did yuh lose in that crooked game i dunno exactly mebbe two hun- dred bucks take that much off that tinhorn cyard sharp hurry up then we'll be movin things are liable to be hot here in another minute or two the boy fumbled over the senseless gambler then stood up this'll do he gulped let's go they left the saloon and got their horses several men were apprzazhing the place yuh lead snapped link an step on it the boy lit out at a pounding gallop with link at his heels shouts followed them then a few shots that flew wild in another moment they were outside of town riding north link spurred alongside where yuh haidin he shouted home answered the boy out to the wineglass about seven about seven miles from here my dad owns it there was no pursuit at least no im- mediate one but link felt that he'd hear about the affair later thinking things over now he was somewhat dis- gusted in getting mixed up in such a scrape after all perhaps he should have let the sharpers fleece the kid and teach him a lesson he felt that his own mission in the country would be much more difficult to perform but he shrugged his shoulders the kid was a likable sort chapter vi colinga tries his luck the wineglass spread lay in a big basin along the foot of the cobalt range and looked to link as he and his companion drew up to it to be a prosperous thriftily run outfit as they pounded to a stop before the comfortable ranch house a middle- aged man and woman stepped cut onto the porch the woman had a gentle motherly face kindly and serene the man was of medium size rather stout with a square blocky face the fighting lines of which link immediately noted and liked heritage of conflict  what's all the rush johnny de- manded the man looking link over keenly an who's yore friend realizing that the boy did not know his name link spoke up i'm link sanderson from up thunder city way me an johnny met in town an he in- vited me out yuh a son of ole eagle sander- son link nodded that's right the man beamed shore i'm glad to meet yuh i've heard of yore daddy an he sounds like my idee of a man i'm bart bidwell an this is my wife how come you an johnny picked up as friends johnny would have blurted out the whole story then and there had not link stopped him with a warning glance oh jest one of those things drawled link we got to talkin missis bidwell i'm happy to know yuh ma'am mrs bidwell smiled and link fell in love with her on the spot you'll stay for supper of course she said which invite i hail an accept with delight ma'am an thank yuh johnny what say we put the hosses up as he said this link caught bart bidwell's eye and gave him a light nod then he started off for the corrals leading his bronc bart bidwell walked along with him while a scared and doubtful-looking johnny brought up the rear as soon as they were out of earshot of the house link turned to bidwell things happened in town he said gravely serious things i didn't want the missis to have to hear about it a couple of jaspers got rocked off a third's got a smashed shoulder and a tinhorn gambler named smythe has got his face pounded in with a gun barrel johnny an me were sorta in the mix- up bidwell whirled on his son so yuh were playin cyards ag'in with smythe an that crowd eh thought i told yuh not to now yuh see what it's led to but of course the ole man didn't know nothin johnny's head came up and he looked his father straight in the eye go ahaid dad he said simply raw- hide me a-plenty i got it comin and the lad proceeded to tell what had happened bidwell stared at the boy whose eyes did not quail but met his own fearlessly link laid his hand on bid- well's arm don't say it sir he drawled johnny made a fool of him- self--an knows it i figger he learned a good lesson--one he won't forget how about it johnny yo're right link said the boy quietly i'm done cyards an likker are things i've shore forgot from now on i mean that bart bidwell relaxed well that's somethin he growled shake san- derson me

yuh got a couple of hours before sup- per over a small glass of whiskey link outlined to bart bidwell the purpose of his visit into the buckeye country bidwell listened carefully and thought- fully his eyes squinted his blocky jaw --ranch romances--first sept  ranch romances set when link finished the rancher nodded yuh come to the right place for in- formation sanderson to my knowl- edge pete hancock has bought two sizable herds of bar c  stock it was reasonable an didn't strike any of the rest of us in this country as bein off- color deals so i didn't pay much at- tention what brand does hancock run asked link the lazy h his range is east some ten miles from here he's less than a dozen miles from splitrock on the a m amp southern railroad split- rock is the shippin point for all us

gamblin this pasco an jardine--who were they couple of hancock's riders i'm tellin yuh again--no loss link was silent for a time thinking he nodded slowly i reckon i got the story deuce coburn made a deal with hancock he's been drivin bar c  stock onto hancock's range ventin the brand an shippin from splitrock then they divvy up hancock gettin so much cut for the use of his iron well i reckon i

laugh the kid didn't throw a single shot--but he was goin to he's game all right two hours later link ate supper with the bidwells bade them good-by and went out to his horse which had rested and fed johnny went with him as link swung into the saddle he looked down at the boy back in buckeye after that mix-up yuh said yuh owed me one johnny i agreed with yuh an said i'd exact pay- ment later i'm gonna take that pay now i want yore promise as a man an a friend that yuh'll leave the likker an cyards alone--from now on remem- ber--on the up an up yo're to behave yoreself savvy yuh heard what i told dad said the boy i meant it i'm done link leaned over swiftly with cut- stretched hand and gleaming smile good kid we'll shake on that things were quiet and on the sur- face amicable enough around the bar c  headquarters loma carlyle with true feminine ardor and an eye for beauty called on aunt molly downs for advice and suggestions and began outlining plans for beautifying the house they discussed window cur- tains some new pieces of furniture and a rug or two heritage of conflict  loma got out pencil and paper and began making a list of the necessary purchases finished with plans for the interior she turned her attention to the out-of-doors and visualized some beds of flowers these satisfactorily outlined she called on deuce coburn and told him of her wishes in turn coburn set his men to work with pick and shovel and superintended matters himself in throwing up a small dam on the creek above the house then ditching water for irrigation down to where the flow- ers would be on the morning of the second day after loma's meeting with link a rider came cantering up to the place bearing a message from judge reynolds that all the necessary legal papers were drawn up and in readiness for her signature so loma decided to go to town imme- diately mrs downs concluded to end her visit for the time convinced that loma had nothing to fear for coburn and his men were treating her with the utmost respect so the two women rode away together loma's business with the judge was soon concluded it is all yours now miss carlyle said the judge handing the papers over to her and here is your uncle's bank book it shows a balance of around thirty thousand dol- lars in the bank at healy i've taken all the necessary steps with jacobs the bank president and you may draw on that balance at any time now loma was amazed and breathless at this news why--why that's a for- tune she stammered i had no idea-- reynolds laughed you rate as a pretty wealthy individual my dear he beamed what with your ranch and that bank balance you are more or less fixed for life there was nothing in stock at the store that satisfied loma's taste in win- dow curtains or furniture so she sent through an order for what she needed as well as a wide miscellany of flower seeds bulbs roots and rose cuttings she stopped in at the downs cabin and had dinner with molly and her hus- band jim--a kindly powerful man with the great corded forearms of his black- smith trade after exacting a promise from mrs downs to come and visit her again shortly loma galloped out of town a great happiness surged through the girl as she rode homeward her inheri- tance was vastly greater than she had surmised and she blessed the old ranch- man who had willed his estate to the orphaned daughter of a younger sister she regretted that she had not known bert mannering better in addition to all this loma knew a subtle thrill at the realization that she would shortly be seeing link sanderson again she was too inherently honest to try and bluff herself concerning the strange feeling she had towards link her past life had been a very stern and busy one with the first consideration always be- fore her of digging a living out of the world for herself her mother had died when loma was very young and her father a mining engineer had been killed in a cave-in when she was fifteen leaving her with practically nothing loma had worked hard fitting her- self to earn her own living and had had no time for romance she had met her share of men men who had offered their attentions but none of them had moved her in any way with link it was different from the first he had intrigued stirred her he was at once a clean-cut stalwart gentle- man yet so starkly a rugged fearless man loma's eyes brightened and her cheeks flushed slightly at mere thought of him on the point from which both of the valleys were visible loma reined in looking down across the sanderson range immediately she picked out a rider down there working slowly through the scattered grazing cattle she had a pair of field-glasses with her which she had found in the house that had evidently belonged to her uncle by the aid of these she quickly identified  ranch romances the rider as old eagle sanderson as she watched him the thought came to her that link would look like that some day erect grizzled poised --a man upon whom the years would rest lightly again she colored and she laughed to herself with secret de- light unconsciously her glasses swept here and there coming to rest finally on an opening in the timber on the ridge that divided the valleys immediately she stiffened she saw another rider down there just in the act of dismounting she saw him hit the ground draw a rifle from the saddle boot then turn and move off towards the edge of the timber in a line that would bring him within two hundred yards of where eagle sanderson was riding loma's identification of this second rider was immediate--that short wide figure with the long dangling arms the bowed legs and strange simian walk joe colinga as surely as she knew her own name loma guessed the import of the situa- tion colinga hating the sandersons with blind feral fury was going to dry- gulch eagle sanderson colinga was that sort--a killer without honor or conscience or sense of shame link had told her that he was positive colinga and glick were the two men who had murdered long andy certainly that had been ruthless and cold-blooded enough and now    loma wasted no further time in thought she wielded a hefty quirt on the amazed buck and went racing towards the valley she did not follow the winding trail instead she surged straight down the steep slope crouch- ing low in the saddle to keep from be- ing swept from her seat by the clawing brush thickets eagle sanderson had been about half a mile distant when she first saw him moving slowly up the valley perhaps six hundred yards now separated him from loma but this seemed like miles to the anxious girl with a final snort and a crash buck plunged clear of the witch hopples and quaking asp and raced into the open bosom of the val- ley loma caught a little gasp of relief as she saw that the old ranchman was still in his saddle unsuspecting and at ease yet at that very moment the flat crash of a rifle echoed eagle sander- son jerked sideways before some invisi- ble force and slithered to the ground his horse well trained and faithful spun a few steps to one side and stopped head upthrown ears pricked towards the point from which the shot came instinctively loma reined in to go racing up to the fallen man now would invite a shot at herself and there was nothing she could do for eagle sander- son a movement showed at the edge of the timber off there in the hostile distance joe colinga appeared walking steadily forward callously levering in another shell at first loma could not understand this move then she re- alized what colinga was about he was going up to his victim to make sure and so intent was he it was quite ap- parent that he had not noted her ap- pearance loma's first thought was to race straight for him to ride in blind defense of the fallen man but this changed im- mediately as she saw colinga stop level his rifle and shoot again she saw the bullet striking high kick up dust just beyond eagle sandersons outstretched figure wild fury coursed through her it was the most brutal cold-blooded thing she had ever seen colinga was going to drive more lead into the motionless ranchman--going to make absolutely sure loma swung to the ground dragged out her own rifle and ran a little apart from her bronco there she dropped to one knee and swung the rifle into line colinga was walking forward again he stopped throwing up his gun hold- ing a coarse bead loma pulled the trigger heritage of conflict  she was astounded at the success of her effort colinga went down like a pole-axed bull and to loma's further amazement eagle sanderson stirred and crawled slowly to his feet where he stood swaying loma ran back to the buckskin swung into the saddle and raced up eagle sanderson watched her come his grim face set in a mask of pain his left arm hung queerly limp and there was a red stain spreading on his shirt over his left shoulder loma set buck to a rearing halt slid to the ground and ran up to the old ranchman mr sanderson she cried thank god he--he didn't kill you after all despite his weakness and pain eagle sanderson smiled grimly no lass he growled thanks to you he didn't i've got a lot to apologize to yuh for yo're true blue--an a grand young- ster loma colored at his praise she got a canteen from her saddle and stepped close to him sit down she ordered that shoulder needs some emergency work when i get a bandage on it i'll get you home let that wait said the grim old fel- low first i'm gonna take a look to make shore that buzzard of a colinga is safe he's either daid as a mackerel or jest creased yuh shot a little high i could see where the bullet cut dust out beyond him loan me yore shoul- der loma did better than that she lifted his sound arm about her neck encircled his torso with her own left arm and put all of her lithe splendid young strength in supporting the ranchman as he stumbled slowly forward to where co- linga lay thought so grunted eagle he ain't daid yuh creased him over the ear lucky we looked at him he'll come outa this in a hurry go get my rope loma thankful in her heart that she had not killed the renegade sped away and soon returned with eagle's riata tie him up came the order i'll show yuh how colinga's wound was little more than a burn above his left ear but there had been enough shock to the bullet to knock him out momentarily already he was beginning to stir slightly but loma under advice from eagle sanderson worked with expert speed half hitches were thrown and drawn tight and when colinga's reptilian eyes flickered and opened and he made his first effort towards freedom loma saw that her work was good the murderous killer was trussed securely colinga began to curse sanderson turned away come lass we'll be goin now i'll send some of the boys up after him back at the horses loma insisted on bathing and bandaging the ranchman's shoulder her own silk neckerchief formed the bandage then she helped him into his saddle and rode close be- side him ready to give him the support of her arm again if it were needed grim old wolf that he was eagle sanderson stuck it out until the quar- ter circle s was reached but here sleepy burch hurried out just in time to catch his boss as the old fellow fainted sleepy's wild yell brought three other riders get him to bed ordered loma it's serious but hardly fatal the bul- let went completely through he's lost quite a bit of blood though when their boss was safely between blankets the riders turned on loma as one man who did it--an how de- manded sleepy joe colinga answered loma she went on to give a brief description of what had happened colinga should still be there she ended mr sander- son said he would send you boys after him while you're about it you'd bet- ter have someone go to town for a doc- tor i'll stay and do what i can we'll get the doc promised sleepy with a meaning glance at the other riders an we'll get colinga too c'mon gang  ranch romances chapter vii a midnight sortie link sanderson arrived at the quarter circle s just after sunup the following morning lines of fatigue were carven about his mouth and nos- trils but his eyes though sunken slightly still gleamed with their old clear light of virility sleepy burch met him at the corrals hell's been poppin said sleepy succinctly joe colinga tried to dry- gulch the ole man link stiffened tried yuh say he barked harshly how'd it happen sleepy went into enthusiastic detail when he finished link smiled dreamily that girl is a wonder sleepy yo're dang whistlin she is declared sleepy vehemently her an eagle are thicker'n blazes already i was in last night after the boss came to an he made her sit next to him an let him hold her hand wished i had a slug- through me he mourned lugubriously link laughed where'd yuh put colinga sleepy i'm gonna have a talk with that jasper right now sleepy's eyes grew evasive and he scuffed the ground with a boot heel well yuh see link--us fellers were sorta hot by the time we got to him an we got to arguin what we should do an yuh know--here he looked up and grinned--somewhere in that argument danged if colinga didn't get hung yes- sir he got strung up to a good stout limb o course we felt sorry after it was all over--but accidents do happen sleepy yo're right declared link solemnly accidents do happen an sometimes they sorta clear the air tell the boys thanks--for me now i reckon i better take a look at dad link found his father partaking of a little nourishment at the hands of loma carlyle at sight of link loma's cheeks burned slightly but she managed a very manner-of-fact greeting your father had a little accident she said quietly but he's doing fine eagle smiled grimly at his son don't let her steer yuh off the track link he rumbled i'd been plenty daid if it hadn't been for her so sleepy jest told me drawled link smiling unspoken thanks at loma an i hear that yuh two are high old tillikums eagle chuckled yo're doggone right if i was twenty years younger i'd marry that girl if i had to steal her to get her but we understand each other don't we lass loma smiled down at the old fellow we understand each other very well by the way what did your riders do with colinga link busied himself with a cigarette put him away for safe-keepin he parried well dad i'm shore happy that colinga didn't hold plumb center as it is yo're gonna miss a lot of fun yuh mean yuh've located some- thin demanded eagle quickly link nodded plenty jest about as we figgered i'm gonna engineer a set-up that'll put a finish to the whole business so don't go to frothin an foamin an agitatin yoreself jest take things easy an get well in the mean- time i'll attend to mister deuce co- burn an his crowd how yuh gonna do it persisted eagle never mind yuh quit worryin about it yuh had yore breakfast yet miss carlyle loma shook her head then we'll eat together i'm gaunt as a wolf over their breakfast loma surveyed link critically you are not only hungry but you look awfully weary she observed i recommend about twelve hours sleep for you i could stand it admitted link but i want to take this opportunity of thankin yuh for what yuh did for dad we are neighbors aren't we re- torted loma lightly we should do favors for each other goodness knows you are doing plenty for me your en- tire trip has been more for my interests heritage of conflict  than for your own so say no more about it okeh grinned link but that ain't gonna keep me from doin a lot of think- in i been doin a lot of that anyhow he added meaningly loma could not meet his eyes her own glance fell to her plate and the color mounted higher in her cheeks she pushed back her chair and stood up i'll be getting along home now your father is resting easily the doctor will be out from town again this afternoon to change the dressing on the wound and after that i'll come over and renew it when necessary yo're very very capable said link softly i never knew there were wo- men like yuh her laugh was a trifle shaky i'm very ordinary really it just happens that part of my preparation for being a frontier school teacher entailed some knowledge of emergency nursing i wonder if you'd have my pony saddled i'll do it myself said link an i'll ride home with yuh after that mix- up with colinga i don't like to have yuh ridin the range alone no protested loma emphatically there's no need of that you get some sleep if you really insist on having someone accompany me let one of your riders go--sleepy for instance he's very nice she finished mischievously he better be growled link i'll cuff his ears if he ain't okeh i'll tell him sleepy burch was more than glad to oblige and after seeing loma safely to her own ranch turned regretfully homeward sleepy was still young enough to know the charm of romance and while he realized perfectly that any dreams he had on the subject were entirely hopeless he found a mournful pleasure in being in the com- pany of this astounding girl a gal like her shore revives a man's faith muttered sleepy as he jogged back along the home trail to loma's surprise the bar c  was apparently deserted on her return there was no sign of life anywhere at first a vague fear filled her so she investigated thoroughly even to the ex- tent of invading the bunkhouse here she found her fears allayed for the place was jammed with personal belongings and equipment evidently coburn and the other riders were merely off on some job about the ranch she went back to the house and re- alized she was very weary herself for she had slept but little the previous night this lack of rest coupled with the strain and excitement of the shoot- ing affray had sapped her strength so she luxuriated in a hot bath then went to bed it was dusk when she awakened greatly refreshed while she was dress- ing she heard the clatter and pound of hoofs looking out of a window she saw coburn and the others just riding in from the southern part of the valley she cooked and ate a solitary supper and was just finishing when a knock sounded on the door she opened it to admit coburn evenin miss carlyle he greeted saw yore hoss in the corrals so i knew yuh'd got back from yore visit to town i jest wanted to report i've had the boys busy all day getting things ready for the spring round-up we been comb- in the timber an gettin what stock we could out in the open i took the liberty of sendin a couple of the gang into town for a few pack loads of supplies we'll start the round- up proper in the mornin shore but it's been a good winter for the stock i never saw a herd in better shape an the increase is way above normal loma carlyle in addition to her other gifts was a passably good actress therefore she showed no sign of her real thoughts she expressed gratifica- tion at the news but her thoughts were along a line that would have amazed the glib self-satisfied foreman she was drawing a mental comparison between link sanderson and this fel- low they were as wide apart as the  ranch romances poles she concluded with link honor and high purpose were the very essen- tial things of existence he was the sort who would speak the truth if it meant hanging for it on the other hand deuce coburn was nothing but a cheap slick crook steal- ing from the ranch that had paid his wages sheltered and fed him he knew neither honor self-respect nor faith the truth was not in him loma roused from her period of thought to find coburn staring at her fixedly and there was a leer in his eyes that sent the hot color sweeping up her throat she had donned a simple house dress of blue gingham which unknow- ingly enhanced the marvelous color of her eyes and set off her vivid beauty amazingly had coburn been but a single order lower on the animal scale he would have licked his lips it shore is easy to work for a boss like yuh he muttered with what was intended for an ingratiating look most men would be plumb satisfied for a smile or two instead of wages we won't discuss personalities if you please said loma coldly you must be weary after your long day's work thick-hided as he was coburn got the hint and before the level chill re- gard of loma's glance heeded it his tone was surly as he growled a good night but he left loma barred the door behind him she frowned with disgust you cheap lying thief she murmured i am continually amazed that a man of judge reynolds type should be taken in by you the way he has thank good- ness link sanderson isn't like him loma did not retire immediately on the contrary she had never felt more wide awake nor for that matter so vaguely uneasy the night was so still so brooding and somehow threatening she went to a window overlooking the bunkhouse and corrals and sat there she could see the lights of the bunk- house and from time to time catch snatches of indistinct voices in the timber above the house a coy- ote was yapping presently from the ridge on the other side of the valley another of the slinking brotherhood re- plied in kind and the night echoed with the poignantly weird and wild sound far down the valley a cow bawled mournfully a terrible stultifying loneliness gripped the girl she could not under- stand it she had not felt like this be- fore on all of that long lone trip from lee's ferry across the wild-horse badlands and the durango desert she had never known the slightest touch of loneliness yet here secure in her own house with a dozen riders within easy call she was fairly aquiver with this foreign emotion the eastern rim of the world took on a burnished silver tinge and presently the moon crept into view round and cold and pure it built intense shadows under the trees but lit up the open spaces almost like day through the stillness loma's ear caught the measured clump of a slowly moving horse her heart took a wild leap perhaps it was link immediately she knew better link would not be over tonight but she smiled mistily that sudden leap of her heart told her all too plainly that what she was half- way sure of before was now a cer- tainty she was in love with link san- derson she forgot the approaching horse for a moment--a precious moment there in the moon-glow while the first full glory of her emotion flowed over her she clutched the thought avidly hungrily and her lips parted in strange ecstasy as she looked through wide glorified eyes across the night to where link sanderson lay sleeping the sound of a coarse whiskey voice jerked her back to stern realities hey coburn came the call the bunkhouse door swung quickly open and deuce coburn stepped out who is it he rasped suspiciously me--texas jack send somebody to take care of my bronc i'm daid heritage of conflict  fagged jest got in from buckeye pete hancock sent me i'm-- shut up snarled coburn yuh must be drunk--bawlin out things of that sort for the whole world to hear shut up--an get inside texas jack muttered a string of curses but subsided loma saw him follow coburn into the bunkhouse a moment later another rider stepped out and led the newcomer's horse off towards the corrals for a long time loma was motion- less but her thoughts were racing texas jack she remembered him now as the drunken brute who had insulted her that first day in thunder city and whom link sanderson had punished for the insult with swift ruthless savagery but what was he doing here now and what news could he bear to co- burn from hancock of buckeye through her mind flitted the signifi- cance of what link sanderson had said to his father and to her hancock was the man who was in the deal with co- burn on the stolen cattle this must have something to do with that phase of affairs again link had just re- turned from the buckeye country per- haps his mission down there had been correctly guessed at daring ideas pulsed through loma she wanted to hear what else texas jack had to tell coburn and there was just one way to do it she ran to where her saddle bags hung extracted her slim but deadly  colt then slipped out- of-doors and poised in the shadows un- der the trees here she waited until she saw the puncher return and enter the bunk- house the one who had taken care of texas jack's horse then picking her way from shadow to shadow she scur- ried down to the corrals from the shelter of these she whisked across an open stretch into the black shadow thrown by the bunkhouse there she halted resting a moment for her breathing to become normal presently she inched along the wall towards a partially opened window just beside this she crouched motionless for the voices of the men inside were clear enough texas jack was speaking that damned link sanderson shore threw a jolt into things down in buckeye he butted into a game of cyards that han- cock was in hancock a cyard sharp named smythe an two of hancock's riders were cleanin out some kid smythe wasn't slick enough with the pasteboards to fool sanderson an san- derson called him guess he got purty rough anyhow when the ruckus was over smythe had his face pushed in from a gun barrel hancock was crippled an his two riders daid naturally han- cock is plenty sore he wants sander- son's scalp an says he'll pay plenty for it but he guessed what sanderson might be down there for an he sent me up here to warn yuh to watch yoreself pete hancock ain't guessed anythin i didn't know came coburn's answer things are gettin too tight around here for comfort so me an the boys figgered to make one last big drive-- a drive that'll clean this damn ranch from one end to the other we were out all day long today combin the tim- ber an concentratin the stock in the lower end of the valley tomorrow on the bluff of startin round-up we'll pick up everything else we can includin all the quarter circle s stuff we can get our hands on an tomorrow night we light out by morn- in we'll be a long way towards buckeye and by the time these thick-haids around here wake up to what's hap- pened we'll be safe on hancock's range what d'yuh think of it texas jack seemed to be considering well he said slowly i'd say it might work all right if the sandersons were out of the way this lone female boss of yores don't amount to a whoop o course as far as puttin up a fight is concerned but them damned sander- sons    coburn laughed brutally forget the sandersons i got joe colinga out  ranch romances lookin for them joe's got a little grub an a blanket an he's jest prowlin around waitin his chance don't be surprised if yuh hear of one or both of the sandersons bein dry-gulched joe'll make a better man at that work than spider glick spider was too proud of himself he felt nobody could beat him to the draw an he liked to get his men at close range allus said he liked to see em kick but his foot shore slipped on his last try joe's more pa- tient he'll get them buzzards see if he don't texas jack cursed i'll shore buy him a drink if he does an say i got an idee long as we're gonna clean this range of cattle tomorrow night why not lug that gal along too the stuck-up little devil i'd like a chance to tame her some a chorus of protest arose nothin doin came a voice that loma recog- nized as belonging to dopey we don't want no woman mixed in this cattle stealin is bad enough but woman steal- in is out yuh try that an i quit the whole game cold there were several additions to dopey's promise by others and texas jack subsided loma waited to hear no more what she had listened to set every outraged fiber of her body quivering with anger something indescribably savage pulsed through her at the moment she felt that given opportunity she could have shot down the entire crowd of traitor- ous thieving riders whom she had fondly believed for a short fatuous pe- riod to be toiling in her interests but she was too level-headed to waste time in useless regrets and futile anger action was imperative--intelligent ac- tion soft as a shadow she whisked away from the bunkhouse to the cor- rals thence back to the ranch house here she swiftly changed to shirt and overalls and boots leaving a lone light burning in her room she belted on her revolver took her rifle from where it stood in a corner and slipped out into the night once more this time she left on the opposite side from the bunkhouse circled far below the corrals then cut directly southwest across the valley the world was still and rapturous beneath the silver sheen of the moon and under ordinary cir- cumstances loma would have been en- tranced by it for in her normally lay a deep appreciation and response to the majesty of nature tonight however she was coldly practical she welcomed the moonlight merely because it made her progress easier straight across the valley she headed aiming for the timber-shrouded ridge that separated her range from that of the sandersons she had first thought of using a horse but discarded the idea before the reali- zation that to do so would entail a big risk of discovery by going this way on foot she had little fear of de- tection in her lungs the crisp night air burned --pure and cold and energizing the night was magic vital the timbered ridge moved rapidly closer before her quick firm stride then she was into it and climbing it was dark under the towering trees and her pace was of necessity slower but she scorned to rest driving steadily onward before the stimulation of need and the electric fountain of perfect health and strength underfoot lay a springy carpet of pine needles and the moist night air was heavy with pungent throat-tingling essence of balsam the long trek ended under the cold brilliant stars of early morning the bulk of the ranch buildings of the quar- ter circle s rose before her still and slumbering thoughtful of old eagle sanderson and his need of quiet and rest she went to the bunkhouse the door was open and through it drifted the sound of heavy breathing and subdued snores sleepy she called softly sleepy burch there came a stir from inside the click of a gun lock heritage of conflict  who is it sounded sleepy's voice hard and suspicious loma carlyle hurry i've got something to tell link she smiled at sleepy's murmured curse of utter amazement and she heard the thump of his boots as he donned them he stepped out of the doorway tousled and disheveled from sleep and hurried dressing you he exclaimed miss carlyle holy smokes what's this all about anyhow you can listen while i tell link get him down here--quick sleepy headed for the main house at a clumsy run still dizzy and befogged with sleep loma followed after him slowly by the time she reached the steps of the porch link emerged with sleepy at his heels link's eyes seemed to flame in the darkness and their contact sent loma's heart to thudding what is it loma he asked tersely link maybe you think i'm crazy but i thought you should know immedi- ately then she went on to tell of the arrival of texas jack at the bar c  and of what she had overheard between him and deuce coburn link listened intently when she finished she found that he had captured both of her hands and was pressing them tightly this is what i expected would happen--an what i hoped for it means that we'll catch em in the act in our own time and way an by bring- in the news immediately yuh've jest guaranteed the success of my plan sometime--later--i'll tell yuh what i think of yore pluck and common sense little lady there never was another like yuh to still the thunder of her heart and cover her confusion loma spoke again link that lying cur of a coburn set joe colinga after you and your father deliberately sent him out to dry-gulch you both and he sent spider glick be- fore colinga oh i know i should not feel this way maybe it is vicious and unwomanish but i could see men like that wiped out of existence and never know a qualm of pity i savvy said link quietly yo're entitled to feel thataway i don't think none the less of yuh for it an we'll take care of mister coburn in our own good time an way sleepy--and here his voice became crisp and forceful-- yuh got a long ride ahaid of yuh-- startin now grab yoreself a relay of about four broncs yo're haidin for buckeye north of buckeye lays the wineglass spread bart bidwell runs it find him an tell him the drive is on salt crick is the place he'll understand what to do--an he's expectin yuh git a wiggle on i'll make yuh up a pack of grub while yuh get the broncs sleepy was a good soldier he took his orders literally and without argu- ment he hurried off to the remuda corral while link led loma into the ranch house where he lit a lamp and showed the way to a food storeroom off the big kitchen the quarter circle s cook slept in the bunkhouse with the other men and link did not bother him he selected an empty flour sack and stuffed it with food then he went down to the corrals again sleepy was ready he tied the food on behind the saddle looped a couple of canteens over the horn and swung astride adios folks he drawled i'll be seein yuh he surged into the night the relay of ponies clattering after him as the sound of sleepy's departure died away link turned to loma that long walk shoulda give yuh an appetite he drawled whimsically what say we scare up a little breakfast then i'll sad- dle a couple of broncs an take yuh home we got about three hours before daylight yet an to play safe we want coburn to think yuh've been home all night if he was to investigate an find yuh'd disappeared he might get sus- picious an not make that drive--which would upset all our plans complete  ranch romances i am hungry admitted loma this will be fun together they cooked the meal and ate it not a great deal was said a strange thrilling constraint lay between them it was as if both were unwill- ing to trust their emotions fate chance or something of the sort was drawing the lives of these two young people closer and closer together welding them in bonds of mutual regard and affection both realized this and a gentle shyness blanketed them they were still silent as they rode away toward the bar c  but it was a silence in which both were queerly enough content not until they had crossed the ridge between the two val- leys and were on the fringe of the open country beyond did link speak he had reined in and was staring out to where the bar c  buildings stood yuh better go on foot from here he decided everythin seems quiet enough an when yuh get there jest flash a light twice from a window on this side that'll tell me yuh got there safe he wanted to say something more something that wasn't so matter-of-fact but for some reason the words would not come the same constraint lay over his companion good night link she said quietly loma slipped to the ground and hur- ried off disappearing in the haze link dismounted and squatted on his heels rolling a cigarette not a sound came to him from the buildings and after a little time a light flickered twice through the night he nodded and stood up as though to mount but he shook his head slowly no he muttered yuh stay right here link sanderson until yuh see that crowd of polecats move out mebbe that dirty rat of a texas jack put over his argument with coburn about takin loma with em i'm stayin until i'm shore of it and stay he did sitting with his back against the bole of a huge sugar pine waiting with the patience of an indian while the day slowly grew out of the night and the dawn began dissipating the mists he saw the renegade riders of the bar c  rise and go about their preparations and finally he saw them leave riding south along the center of the valley when they had disappeared with texas jack in their midst link rose stiffly mounted and cut back over the ridge towards home chapter viii coburn's raid all day long the renegade riders of the bar c  worked feverishly the cattle they had bunched in the val- ley the previous day had scattered some but not badly these were once more bunched and started moving towards the lower end of the valley leaving them in the care of three of his men coburn sent the rest into the timber again to pick up any stragglers that had been overlooked the day before this is our last big chance at the gravy he growled we don't want to overlook any of it there was no complaint from the rid- ers the more cattle they threw into this rustled herd the bigger their cut of the profits would be so they spared neither themselves nor their horses coburn had collected a small remuda of saddle mounts and as soon as any bronco showed signs of exhaustion the rider would race in to the remuda and pick a fresh horse these men despite the crooked twist in their make-up were top-hands every one--men who knew their business--and there was nothing overlooked coburn detailed himself and texas jack as guards he selected as his own point of outlook a spot on too of the dividing ridge between the bar c  and the quarter circle s ranges from this spot by the aid of a pair of field- glasses he could scrutinize all that went on at the sanderson ranch but he could find no evidence of untoward activity heritage of conflict  at that place after one long look he lowered the glasses with a sneer yuh pose as bein such a wise jasper link sanderson he muttered but this is shore one time when yo're sound asleep at the switch time yuh wake up to what's goin on we'll be a long way from here--too far away for yuh to do anythin about it an some day later on mebbeso we'll meet again yuh an me i'll finish the score then if joe colinga don't beat me to it at noon the rustlers stopped for a short bite to eat then resumed their toil and when sundown came and they gathered around coburn the latter knew by the size of the herd before them that the bar c  range had been combed clean we eat an rest for an hour said coburn then we hit the trail i know yuh fellers are tired but this ain't the time to stop tired--hell spat one of the riders i've rode thirty-six hours at a stretch more'n once in my life--an for jest what measly wages i was drawin with a real stake in sight i'll ride fifty if i have to i reckon the rest of the gang feel the same by the nods and grunts of approval it was plain that he had expressed the sentiments of the rest a hard game crowd mused coburn that would stand a lot of stopping to keep them from put- ting this thing over he thought of link sanderson again of loma carlyle and particularly of that fatuous old fool of a judge reynolds he barked a short sneering laugh of contempt at the quarter circle s ranch head- quarters link sanderson was moving leisurely enough he met the men at breakfast and told them to stick around close to the ranch and put their riding equipment their rifles and gun- belts in good shape when questioned about the absence of sleepy burch link merely grinned yuh know said shorty pierce scrubbing a cleaning patch industriously up and down the barrel of his winches- ter yuh know i'll swear to gosh that i heard somebody come an get sleepy outa bed early this mornin i didn't wake up complete but i heard em jest the same--sorta in a dream like yuh would snorted bob rennifer shorty's bosom pal and perpetual tor- ment yo're allus havin some sort of pipe-dream i never seen one of these little sawed-off squirts like yuh that wasn't full of fits an starts yuh prob- ably heard jim snorin--that's what yuh heard bob winked at jim staley a gaunt old puncher with little twinkly eyes and a grave mahogany-colored face jim nodded  twas either that or the ghost of joe colinga was spurtin him bob agreed the old puncher gravely yuh know i was plumb shocked the way shorty acted day before yestiday he was plumb bloodthirsty the way he pulled on the rope when we strung up colinga sorta horrified me yuh might say shorty's round pink-cheeked face turned a brick red truth be known shorty had been a trifle sick at the spec- tacle of stern and ready justice the quarter circle s punchers had meted out on the murderous renegade yah he retorted yuh jaspers think yo're smart don't yuh--jest be- cause yuh got a set of innards as hard as nigger-haid rocks but if yuh know so much where is sleepy answer me that if yuh can bob looked at shorty in pitying amazement why don't yuh know shorty shucks that's shore too bad sleepy's gone to kalamazoo to borrow a left-handed monkey wrench shorty tossed his winchester onto his bunk and stamped to the door of the bunkhouse there he turned yah he blurted yah yuh long-laiged hoss-faced drink of alkali yah-h with that final broadside he stumped off to the saddle shed with all the dig- nity his five-foot-three-inch carcass could muster jim staley curled up on his bunk convulsed with silent laughter bob rennifer grinned from ear to ear  ranch romances josé salvatore a lithe sunny-faced young mexican vaquero who possessed the undying friendship and admiration of every man on the ranch smiled gently behind this bantering front every one of them knew that serious business of some sort portended and their prepara- tions were thorough and painstaking by mid-afternoon they were ready not a detail overlooked and now link gathered them about him again he told them what was in the air and laid his plans before them we could go over right now an bust this thing up he concluded but it would- n't get the results i want coburn could take the stand that he was merely pull- in a round-up in the usual way an while we'd know different we couldn't prove it as it is we'll let em make the drive they'll start tonight we'll let em go all night an we'll be follerin em come mornin we'll have em where we want em coburn won't have an alibi then that'll hold water we'll have him cold an once an for all we'll clear the at- mosphere in these parts supposin drawled jim staley slowly supposin when we come up on em they don't elect to make a fight of it link mebbe they'll jest light right out an keep on runnin we'll get the cattle back but we won't do much harm to their scurvy hides link nodded i thought of that jim an i've made arrangements that's where sleepy is i sent him off early this mornin to carry word to bart bid- well who runs the wineglass spread north of buckeye bart's a friend of mine an will know what to do he'll be layin out with some of his men in the willows along salt crick an should coburn lose his nerve an make a run for it bart'll be waitin for him shorty turned on bob and jim tri- umphantly yah--yuh wise aigs did- n't i tell yuh i heard somebody get sleepy out early this mornin think yo're wise don't yuh yuh win shrimp grinned bob yuh win yo're doggoned right expanded shorty i allus win when do we start link no hurry drawled link if we don't leave until midnight we can come up to em easy by dawn they can move jest so fast with the stock so seein as yuh'll have to miss a lot o sleep to- night yuh might as well store up some while the chance is good in the crisp invigorating chill of night link and his men saddled up there was no delay in their departure link took the lead and they swung south and east circling the lower end of the ridge that divided the two val- leys as they struck the tableland and turned directly east a low rumbling overtone came to their ears it was the combined complaint of cattle under forced drive link reined in rolling a cigarette they're jest clearin the lower end of the bar c  range he announced we got a lot of time take it easy they killed a good half hour before moving on again then dropped in di- rectly behind the stolen herd some half mile or more in the rear the warm bovine smell of the cattle hung thick in the damp air link called to josé sal- vatore his mexican rider josé yo're far an away the best scout in this crowd yuh sneak on ahaid an get a line on that gang see if they're actin in any way suspicious they may have put out a rear guard of some sort so to speak an we don't want to go blunderin into a ambush jose's white teeth gleamed and he cantered quickly off link held his own pace and that of the others down to a slow walk the hours wore away josé returned to report that the raiders had no rear guard out but were concentrat- ing every man on the task of keeping the herd moving as fast as possible the complaint of the cattle was con- stant and now and then echoing faintly came the shrill high-pitched yell of a heritage of conflict  rider urging the bellowing herd on- ward shore mused link coburn ain't complimentin my good sense any he musta figgered to ketch me sound asleep well he allus was powerful shore of himself he'll learn his lesson too late when dawn gray and chill broke over the world the herd had passed the point where the tableland ran down to the edge of the desert link's wariness increased to be seen now would spoil everything therefore he led the way to the base of the cobalts and into the timber we'll skirt along through here he explained we'll be able to keep closer this way without the chance of bein seen when're we gonna pop the whistle link asked shorty impatiently them jaspers are gettin plumb in the open now wait'll we hit salt crick answered link bob rennifer looked at his stubby partner yuh musta had a change of heart shrimp what'cha been doin-- drinkin tiger's milk never saw yuh so full of hell an leather bet the first time a gun goes off yuh'll beat it fer parts unknown oh--yeah snapped shorty well i'll tell the world that if i do i'll be plumb strangled on the dust yuh'd be kickin up while leadin the way the sun rose and climbed upward the distant herd and the rustlers were almost hidden by the dust that funneled into the air in the distance a low wind- ing line of green showed--salt creek link reined in again his manner brisk and sure bob you and shorty cut straight south until yuh get well beyond the herd then turn east an move up fast josé and jim take this side move up on the flanks an don't let anybody break through i'll hold the center my- self this job is one that's been a long time overdue we might as well make it a good one while we're at it an that crowd would prefer lead to a rope any time i would myself savvy what yo're to do the riders nodded good one thing more--bart bidwell an his boys are out along the crick don't go shoot- in into them willows this oughta be over quick let's go--an good luck the long wait was over and action ahead of them at last the trap had been set the quarry had entered it and now came the final act of springing that trap low in their saddles link's men raced away link had taken the most dangerous position himself he did it without any thought of heroics it was simply the creed he had been born and bred to he knew that when the surprise first came coburn and his men would surge straight ahead but the reception they would get at the creek would make them rebound like a wave striking a rocky shore what was left of them would come pounding back at him some might cut out to the flanks but would turn in again when they met a reception from bob and shorty josé and jim the five of them had just about at- tained their desired positions before dis- covery came this was announced by a snarling report or two that sent lead skittering in dusty paths around shorty and bob these two wasted no time in returning the fire from the opposite flank josé and jim opened up caught between two fires coburn re- acted as link had figured he would he called his riders about him decided that as far as the cattle were concerned it was a lost cause then thundered out straight ahead for salt creek there dismay and fear bit deep for a volley of long-range rifle fire came that cut down two men and a horse the horse happened to be coburn's own he kicked free of the saddle as the beast went down and caught one of the mounts that had lost a rider it was dopey's horse dopey himself was crumpled up in a tangled heap at the final end of a crooked trail that he had traveled all his life  ranch romances coburn tried the north flank then figuring that if he could reach the tim- ber he could make a getaway he lost another man at this before the deadly accuracy of jim staley's winchester another of coburn's band racing south paralleling the creek found himself cut off by the alert shorty and bob he fought it out cursing and des- perate shorty went down one side of his head gory bob rennifer with a whim- pering curse tore down on the rustler shooting at every jump of his horse at two hundred yards he found the target and the rustler slumped then bob whirled back to his partner he choked out broken words of thanksgiving when he found that shorty had merely been creased so far link had fired not a single shot in fact he had seen no one to shoot at but he could chart the course of battle easily by the sound of the guns he was especially gratified by the vol- ley that came from the willow-shrouded reaches of salt creek that about settles it he muttered it was the one big gamble of my play if sleepy hadn't been able to git bid- well on the job then our birds would shore enough have slid through to a getaway as it is  his eyes smarted from the dust that billowed into the air in ever thickening clouds the cattle were moiling and bawling in fright and confusion yet their thirst was stronger than any mere fear of gunshots and their prog- ress towards the water in salt creek was steady abruptly the cattle split and through the dust came two riders leaning far over and spurring madly they did not see link until they were within ten yards of him one set his bronco to a rearing halt the other swerving aside and pounding past both began shoot- ing link's own gun winked back in mea- sured reply the rider who had halted went down in a welter of dust and hoofs and link his left arm limp and dead and bloody whirled after the last fugitive it was deuce coburn craven and ven- omous out of the dust thundered link and coburn the latter some hundred yards in the lead link's face white and drawn with pain was nevertheless set in a mask of relentless iron his eyes narrow and cold for a time coburn held his own but his mount was tired from the work of the day before and the all-night drive link's bronco was the stronger and be- gan cutting down the distance between them coburn spurred and quirted madly but to no avail with inexorable surety link drew up coburn's face looking back over his shoulder was white and snarling he began shooting throwing shot after shot in a wild effort to stop this figure of retribution coming steadily on link held his fire knowing he would need it later something whisked link's hat from his head sending it spinning he scarcely noticed it and then he saw an amazing thing one that sent a surge of disgust through him coburn dragged his badly blown horse to a stop slid to the ground and stood there his hands high over his head coburn had turned yellow--quit when a showdown was in- evitable link reined in beside the craven his gun bearing steadily on coburn's heart don't shoot gasped coburn for gawd's sake don't shoot i quit i give in i'll get all the cattle back if yuh'll gimme a chance--just a chance to square myself that's all i ask don't shoot for the moment link said nothing though his tight lips curled in scorn he heard other riders pounding towards him and a high-pitched yell told him it was his own men josé salvatore and jim staley whirled up tie him up jim snapped link coburn did not protest he merely shook and whined his last vestige of courage absolutely gone by the time jim had finished other riders came rac- heritage of conflict  ing with sleepy burch and bart bid- well leading the way and presently came bob rennifer supporting a con- scious but very sick shorty in his saddle none of em got by us link shouted sleepy how about it i reckon it was a complete clean-up said link quietly this rat is the last an he's tryin to beg off bob how bad is shorty hurt bob was grinning in relief not too bad he's got a hard haid the shrimp has it turned that slug same as a hunk of iron might but yuh got a bad wing yoreself it's nothin said link i'll make out now then men what d'yuh think we oughta do with that he nodded towards coburn that's easy link said jim staley coldly he planned this steal and the rest paid he oughta pay too i sug- gest a rope no gasped coburn not that-- not that i'll square everythin--i'll square it i say yuh cain't rasped link yuh cain't bring back long andy an i know yuh set spider glick an joe colinga after him same as yuh set em after dad an me no yuh cain't square a thing coburn the rest of yuh boys have heard what jim suggested what's yore sentiments on the matter the answering chorus spelled doom to coburn for a moment link thought the fellow was going to crumple right where he stood but hot sour hate gal- vanized him to some semblance of courage he cursed and spat his red eyes fixed on link damn yuh sanderson he shrieked yuh think yuh've won don't yuh yuh'll find out different ever hear of texas jack well where is he he started out with us but he was crazy over that carlyle dame an he's gone back after her yuh lose after all link's head jerked up and he whirled to the others who's got the fastest and freshest hoss he demanded his voice husky quick i want it sleepy slipped to the ground this bronc'll qualify link but man yo're wounded let me go--let any of us go we-- gimme that hoss snapped link i'm all right before the rest could speak again he was in the saddle and racing away back to the bar c  range chapter ix hungry hearts texas jack crouched in the tim- ber on the main slope of the co- balts a quarter of a mile above the bar c  ranch buildings his eyes small glittering and bloodshot stared down- ward with the set feral patience of some beast of the wild he had broken away from coburn and the rest of the raiders shortly before midnight co- burn had cursed him roundly on hear- ing of his plans but the renegade had insisted stubbornly if yuh don't finish this drive with us yuh won't come in for any cut on the profits coburn had threatened texas jack had shrugged keep yore profits had been his answer i'm goin back coburn cursed with greed had finally acquiesced he concluded to say nothing to the others planning to pocket texas jack's share himself and texas jack had turned his horse on the back trail the renegade's brain was warped far back in his cowardly soul he hated loma carlyle bitterly hated her al- most as much as he did link sander- son the memory of the ignominious manner in which link had smashed him to the ground that first day in thunder city when he had accosted loma burned in him like a hot iron he had sworn vengeance that day and each passing hour had intensified his thirst for revenge being the innate coward and bully that he was texas jack had no desire to run into link sanderson he was hoping against hope that joe colinga --ranch romances--first sept  ranch romances would succeed where spider glick had failed and he resolved that loma carlyle should pay both her own debt and that of link he had not hurried his trip back he would take his time he decided-- take his time and play the game abso- lutely safe therefore though he reached the bar c  just at dawn he did not immediately go to the build- ings he had heard of the way molly downs had beaten joe colinga to earth and he had no desire to run foul of this stalwart western woman she might have come down to the ranch to visit loma again so the renegade had taken up his position well up in the timber where he could watch without being seen he was going to make sure that loma was absolutely alone before he made any move the sun came up dispelling the mists of night and warming the spring- touched slopes smoke curled up from the chimney of the ranch house per- haps an hour later loma herself ap- peared she went to the corrals sad- dled a bronco and took the trail for thunder city texas jack's first inclination was to attempt to ride her down but he gave this up on realizing that she might and probably would outrun him also she carried a rifle and he knew that she was the sort who would use it so he bided his time his hate feeding his patience hunger came upon him and as the ranch was to all intents deserted he slipped down cautiously and made his way to it from the storehouse he se- cured a supply of food and went back to his hide-out after eating he stretched himself in the sun and slept it was mid-afternoon when he awoke to resume his scrutiny of the ranch house just in time to see loma return- ing from town still alone his lips twisted in savage satisfac- tion his opportunity was at hand he'd give her time to become settled down then make his advance loma unsaddled and walked briskly to the house she disappeared and the place lay somnolent and quiet from his saddle boot the renegade lifted his rifle hitched up his gunbelt and stole downward after removing his spurs in the cause of quietness he selected a blind corner of the ranch house for his advance and slipped across the intervening space without challenge of any sort here his stealth and care intensified silent as a shadow he glided along and peered around the next corner to view the porch a leer of triumph twisted his repelling unshaven fea- tures there was an old canvas loung- ing chair in evidence and in this was couched the slim strong figure of the girl she was asleep her face soft and glowing in repose turned slightly towards him she had loosened her hair and it spread beneath her head in a blue-black cascade of sheening silk texas jack's eyes narrowed his leer became more pronounced like some prowling jungle cat he stole towards her once she stirred and sighed a lit- tle like a tired child texas jack froze his lips peeling back but loma soon quieted and he moved forward cnce more a step in front of her he paused feasting his eyes on her loveliness then with a muttered curse his talon hand flashed forward and fastened on her shoulder loma awoke with a start staring up at him the color drained from her face and for a second deep in her eyes lay naked unashamed terror you she gasped yeah he leered me i come back to settle a little debt the terror in her eyes vanished and scathing anger and contempt replaced it take your filthy hand off me she blazed link told you he'd kill you if you ever bothered me again and he will texas jack laughed wolfishly he won't be in any condition to kill any- body after joe colinga gets through with him it was loma's turn to laugh you heritage of conflict  fool joe colinga made the mistake of trying to dry-gulch eagle sanderson the other day evidently you didn't know about that but if you're waiting for joe colinga to do anything to link you'll have a long wait texas jack knew that loma was telling him truthful words he hadn't heard about that particular incident and he was visibly startled but he steadied again either way it ain't gonna help yuh any yo're goin with me yuh can take yore choice of comin along peaceable or bein tied up which'll it be loma's brain had been racing her first furious anger at herself for being thus caught off her guard gave way to desperate cunning her demeanor changed she appeared to wilt helpless with fright d-don't tie me she stammered i'll come quietly it gratified the brute in texas jack to see this girl apparently quailing in terror before him he gloated over the spectacle loma had seemingly col- lapsed into tears her hands were over her face her shoulders heaving con- vulsively but had the renegade looked closely enough he would have seen through her slightly spread fingers eyes of stormy smoky violet watching him alertly he straightened up removing his grasp this was easy--too easy he had thought all along that this girl had courage that she was a fighter and he had relished the thought of taming her but here she was in a typically femi- nine paroxysm of tears shaking before his mere glance okeh he snarled i won't tie yuh up but if yuh don't come quiet or if yuh try any tricks i'll quirt the devil outa yuh stand up she did with an explosive sudden- ness that texas jack wasn't looking for and as she gained her feet one small brown tightly clenched fist curved up and out with all her hundred and twenty pounds of outraged dignity behind it it landed with a very re- spectable spat on the renegade's face spinning him off balance and before he could recover himself she had leaped off the porch and was running like a deer for the corrals cursing and raging texas jack went after her but she beat him to the first fence slithered over it just out of his reach and topped the next one before he could catch her by the time the renegade had topped this one she was among the sheds and feed barn then began a game of desperate hide-and-seek honest fear tipped loma's heels with wings as she dodged hither and yon just managing to keep her lead she knew it could not last forever sooner or later staunch as she was this brute would tire her out however she determined to fight for her freedom as long as she possibly could she wondered if her traitorous riders had left a weapon of any kind in the bunkhouse she began working around to make a dash for it but texas jack guessing her intent headed her back he was cursing horribly loma thought of a drooling mad animal her strength began to go link she murmured brokenly link she caught up a short length of wood and with her back to the wall of a shed determined to make a final des- perate stand there was just a chance that she might get in a lucky blow with the club held high she faced the renegade her heart thundering cruelly her breath coming in gasps berserk the renegade charged in she swung the club with all her might and texas jack caught the impact on an upraised warding arm the next moment he had her his hands tearing at her like claws neither heard the pounding desperate hoofs of a horse hammering to a halt not far away loma fought with all her strength but knew it was a losing fight the cry that came from her throat seemed to rise of its own accord despairing heart-broken  ranch romances link link right here sweetheart the answer reached her ears and she thought she must be dreaming but it was no dream the manner in which texas jack was torn away from her and thrown headlong nor was there anything dream-like in the lean dusty blood-stained figure that faced the sprawled renegade faced him in a low deadly crouch loma tried to speak her arms out- stretched but the arms fell empty by her sides the words did not come for link was not looking at her his face pale and pain-twisted beneath the ma- hogany tan was as bitter and stern and cold as death his eyes held the abysmal chill of glacial ice and they stared with unwinking intentness at texas jack who was struggling to his feet his features a mirror of mingled fear hate and thwarted cunning link was speaking and his words fell in low measured cadence the finish yuh poison polecat throw em i'm gonna kill yuh any- how--but throw em texas jack didn't want to throw his guns in an even break he had always maneuvered for an edge--for a set-up in his favor but death was looking him in the eye remorseless certain he licked his lips staring at link's face lined and gray and haggard he noted the limp dangling left arm and the blood-clotted sleeve maybe the edge was there after all maybe this fellow was far gone with weakness from that wound maybe his movements would be slowed down just that split second which meant the dif- ference of life or death for the first and last time in his life the renegade gambled his hands blurred down and started up they only started for there was red flame dancing before him measured thunder in his ears and hot vengeful lead lashing through his body beating him backward crushing out the life spark pounding him down    down    down    like an empty useless tossed-aside sack texas jack slithered to the ground without having fired a single shot a long minute link sanderson stared at the lifeless figure before him then he straightened slowly--a man in- finitely weary he turned to face the girl who was coming to him her face white but her eyes brilliant with death- less glory loma he mumbled loma-- honey he tottered and sagged his face fall- ing still and silent against her as she caught his crumpling body in her arms eagle sanderson barked wrathfully at sleepy burch doggone it he roared yuh ain't told me how bad link's hurt sleepy grinned boss yuh oughta be ashamed of yoreself d'yuh think link is the sort to pass out from a single slug an him yore own son shucks that jasper couldn't be killed with a post maul all right growled the old fellow now that yuh've quit searin me into fits suppose yuh tell me what hap- pened roll me a cigarette first sleepy rolled the smoke put it be- tween eagle's lips scratched a match and obediently related his tale when the rest of us got to the bar c  he concluded we finds texas jack was daid as he'll ever be an link sprawled cut in the shade with miss carlyle holdin his haid in her arms cryin over him an kissin him plumb scandalous link had jest come to an seemed to be shore enjoyin hisself anyhow josé an me finally got him to the house an in blankets an josé went after doc jasper i stuck around until the doc got there an fixed link up then i come home to report an that's all i reckon --exceptin that there'll shore be a wed- din in these parts before long eagle sanderson chuckled happily sleepy he said i ain't had a drink for a month let's celebrate a strange trail by  clinton dangerfield courage such as molly wardell possessed comes to but a few brave hearts and surely molly should have as mate a man whose valor equalled hers molly thought she had made such a choice until she took that strange trail that led to new and untried dangers a dozen of the diamond d geld- ings half wild from long dis- use galloped unwillingly toward the gaping mouth of the home corral forced on by molly wardell and her father wardell's stern blue eyes softened as he watched the careless ease of his daughter's riding knee grip as good as a man's thought wardell and no other girl half as pretty in this whole damn county molly caught his glance and flashed an eager happy smile at him nothing delighted her more than aiding in the recapture of horses needed for the re- muda she whirled her mount cutting off the escape of a plunging gray then gave a triumphant whoopee as the bunch streamed into the corral before her father could leave his saddle she sprang down put up the bars then leaned against them laughing at him beat yuh to it dad don't yuh think i'm just as good as lin at round- ing em up lin muttered her father suddenly frowning molly he claims you two will marry soon as he gets back from mexico with them cattle that true she nodded assent her lovely sun- bronzed face serious now molly lin derry's temper has showed up plumb hellish in the past two years i've had to pay him out of lots of trouble count of it oh yeah i know he's never showed you no temper--a man don't in courtin days she seized on a chance to change the subject look dad yonder comes a rider toppin that rise   ranch romances wardell turned in his saddle his stern eyes narrowed comin hell for leather bad news damn that's curt jones who ought to be down in mexico with lin they waited breathless then the man raced up to them his horse slid to a halt curt dusty haggard waited for no greeting but broke out as he halted lin's in bad trouble mr wardell them cattle were lousy an lin went wild over the long ride he'd had for nothin i tried to tame him down cause he had yore roll and we needed to keep cool couldn't do nothin with him he knocked mendoza down an when the fellow hops up he goes for his gun course lin beat him to the draw --kilt him molly whitened at the news clutched at the bars for support this here mendoza curt went on was a cousin of general yznaga's the general and his men was expected in an hour ridin through there lin was jailed and yore roll o course disap- peared in the process boss yznaga come in sooner'n they expected and i got private speech with him he said lin would be shot at sunrise an i said if he'd give me time to get to you yuh'd ransom him wardell looked grim at this and said nothing but this here yznaga the cowboy continued he's a dandy and a great horseman he's horse-mad like some folks are money-mad he says to me if i'll bring him ace the golden stallion he'll take the horse in exchange for lin's life an let lin escape secretly yznaga was up here once and seen ace tried to buy him from kit bridger but couldn't so ridin relays i came to kit bridger's place an told him what yznaga said kit says reckon yuh know lin derry sent me word just afore he went down into mexico that he aimed to shoot me on sight when he got back he picked a quarrel with me over nothin wardell stepped in be- tween us but that only put the matter off now yo're askin me to send the only thing i care about down into the hands of those mexicans to be rode to death cut to pieces with a quirt ace saved my life twice an i'll not do it and says kit moreover reckon yuh got sense enough to know curt that if yznaga did let lin escape from jail he'd see to it he was shot while he was runnin it's a little spanish custom  and i'll bet kit told yuh wardell interpolated harshly that if yuh went back down into mexico yuh'd never leave there alive once yuh delivered the stallion that mendoza had a follow- ing yznaga wouldn't dare leave anyone alive who knew he'd traded the life of mendoza's killer for a horse yeah curt said wearily slipping from his saddle and supporting him- self by an arm hooked over the saddle horn he said that so i bor- rowed me a fresh horse from kit and come on fast as i could kit bridger's heartless cruel gasped molly but we'll get up a res- cue party we'll save lin her father shook his head yznaga has that section of mexico under mar- tial control we couldn't raise three men for an expedition like that because it would be suicide for all of us i'm sorry for lin molly i'm sorry for yuh but    he stopped and turned to curt come on up to the house time yuh had food and drink curt ate drank fell across the bed pointed out to him and slept like a log meanwhile molly wept and argued but at last her father made her see clearly that nothing would induce either himself or his friends to attempt a res- cue this was confirmed by two of the neighboring ranchers who rode in on business both of them said just as wardell had done that they were sorry for lin but something chill about their regrets made it plain that the devilish temper lin had shown in the past two years had wrecked all the good-will the neighborhood had once felt toward him that night at ten o'clock wardell a strange trail  drew his daughter close to him and said yuh understand now molly that we'd give help if we could but we can't he brought this on himself yuh don't want us to go down there merely to die in the same town with him eh she clung to her father no i don't want that then yuh go up to yore room and try to sleep yo're worn out with this storming and crying she nodded exhausted with emotion he kissed her and she went meekly away she flung herself dressed as she was in her riding clothes on the bed there she lay face upward staring at the ceiling not sleeping but thinking that night about two o'clock a slender figure carefully dressed in men's clothes slipped like a shadow from the ranch house and in a short time rode quietly into the starlit night heading straight for kit bridger's place her only precaution against pursuit was to leave her father a note saying she had left for omaha to visit a friend her father might not believe her but it would take him some time to check up on her whereabouts meanwhile she would be well on her way to mexico molly found bridger's very quiet when she arrived kit and his men were asleep in the ranch house as he had no family the main building was ranch house and bunkhouse in one no dog barked only in the distance an owl hooted dismally dismounting molly stripped her own horse turned it into the corral she would use her own outfit on the mount that she was after now--the great golden stallion ace he was not loose in the corral he wouldn't be his temper was too high to turn him among the geldings she made straight for the barn the first stall she came to was occupied by ace it was a heavy stall built of timber reinforced the door solid oak and pad- locked she stared at the padlock in dismay remembering now that curt some days before had told her bridger had said two attempts had been made to steal the stallion but she had never thought of bridger's keeping him under lock and key she recalled also that curt reported bridger as saying any thief who gets ace signs his own death warrant i'll never leave the trail till i find him well if she could ever get the pad- lock open kit bridger might trail all he liked for the golden stallion was the fastest animal in the whole countryside she might trust ace to show a clean pair of heels to anything which kit bridger could ride after them the padlock soon demonstrated to her that only the key would serve her purpose she stood thinking that key would be somewhere in kit's own room --probably in his clothes she knew that the only ranch-owner distinction bridger affected was that of occupying a bedroom of his own she had ques- tioned curt artfully about kit bridger and all his habits she herself knew nothing of him except the brief glimpse she had had once while both of them were in town so with a desperate courage which refused to think of danger she went straight to the house people of this countryside didn't bolt their doors and molly found the front door unlocked as she had expected once inside she again drew upon the information she had cunningly extracted from the unsuspecting curt bridger's room lay to the left at the front on the other side of the narrow hall further back his men testified to their sound slumber by loud snores but kit bridger's room was silent she stole to his door it was closed but not locked she soon found as her cau- tious fingers slowly turned the knob now as she opened the door a little way her heart jumped at the sound of the rusty hinges creaking but bridger sound asleep on the bed did not wake through the curtainless wide-open windows the newly risen moon round and bright poured a flood  ranch romances of brilliance thankful for its aid molly hurried softly to the chaps and trousers flung carelessly across a chair the key was not there again she stood thinking and unwill- ingly enough realized that the key was probably under kit bridger's pillow she had left her boots hanging to the horn of her saddle and her moccasin- clad feet were light as falling feathers as she crept toward kit bridger's bed- side he lay on his back one hand flung out across the sheet which covered him even in sleep his handsome bronzed face looked stern the mouth resolutely closed between the fine arch of his brows a slight frown which had be- come habitual added its touch of warn- ing not to meddle with a man whom many feared his gun was not in his holster and molly realized with deepening fright that if the key were under his pillow no doubt the gun was also she was in men's clothes if she waked him getting at the key what if he jerked out the gun and shot her before he realized she was only a girl angrily she told herself she hadn't come there to entertain such thoughts she had shouldered a man's job and like a man she must get through with it ignoring whatever terrors lay in the path above all she needed coolness now and steadiness close to the bedside she stared down anxiously at kit bridger's face and sud- denly found herself held by it she shook off the deepening fascination was she mad to be standing there star- ing at a man who if he waked might kill her crouching beside him she thrust small exploring fingers under his pillow keeping the pressure of her fingers al- ways down against the mattress hop- ing in this way not to disturb him she would have had little chance of contin- uing this had not bridger been without sleep for the last forty-eight hours seeking the doctor for an injured man wrestling with a stampede and other unexpected troubles had resulted in to- night's deep sleep although usually the slightest sound the faintest vibration would waken him molly pushed her hand on further sometimes moving it to the right some- times to the left then suddenly just as she had given up hope her small fingers touched the key and still the sleep- lost man did not feel her presence in the room yet he dreamed of molly wardell--a troublesome dream which made him stir in his sleep he nearly froze molly with terror by rolling over on his left side and bringing his face directly opposite hers his weight holding her hand now still under the feathers he must be waking she squatted back on her heels frozen with fright then as he lay quite still she slowly and cautiously withdrew the key silence deepened in the room kit bridger ceased to dream at all and sank once more into deep sleep he did not waken till his usual hour just before dawn then as with all healthy people body and mind snapped into instant alertness he flung the covers aside walked to the window stretched then instinctively glanced toward the barn a curse leaped from his lips the door of ace's stall was wide open at furious speed kit bridger woke his men allotted to them their ranch tasks hurriedly got together the few things he wanted for the trail and roped the horse next best to the golden stallion then deaf to the warnings of his men not to follow the trail over the rio grande because of the turbulent condition of mexico bridger took up his quest of vengeance and of recapture to regain ace he would follow that trail through the whole length of mex- ico he swore to himself cursing curt jones in one breath and in another cer- tain horse rustlers whom he half sus- pected to be the guilty parties he had one advantage which molly wardell did not think of--there had been a hard rain the day before which a strange trail  made trailing easy and kit bridger had another advantage which he himself did not suspect the thief riding the golden stallion knew nothing of the route curt had ridden it was for this reason that molly riding out of her way and then into the right direction again handicapped her flight to such an extent that on the second day of her desperate ride she looked up from the floor of a gorge and to her terror saw a pursuing horseman riding down the trail above her she should have broken into instant flight as it was she believed that the man above had not seen her where- upon she cut across the floor of the gorge to hide in a ravine which ran deep into the west side of the gloomy place kit bridger not daring to hope that the thief was really riding for the cut snatched his rifle from the boot raised it to his shoulder and took steady aim at the fleeing figure the man on that horse was just about curt jones size small and slender yes it was curt and to hell with him because he valued a snarling quarreler like lin derry was that any reason why kit bridger should lose the one thing which still made life bright for him--the mag- nificent stallion curt rode kit knew he could not miss the shot was well within his rifle range he had killed mountain sheep at a much greater distance under much greater difficulties his trigger-finger hugged closer closer --pulled the trigger only a snap answered him in haste he examined the rifle and found that when the key had been stolen from un- der his pillow the thief had paused on the way out to ruin the mechanism of the weapon no doubt he had carried it out into the hall for that purpose where the faint sounds he made could not be heard kit bridger jammed the rifle back into its boot then almost uttered a yell of triumph for he saw the thief turn into the cut the fool thought he was hiding there well let him think so bridger rode down into the gorge at furious speed then galloped hard along the floor but kept straight ahead as though he were going to pass the arroyo east of the mouth even yet if the thief darted out at the top speed of the golden stallion he might escape should bridger happen to miss him with his short gun as the rancher drew even with the mouth of the ravine he saw no signs of the horse-thief issuing forth so he whirled his mount crossed the gorge floor in a flash and was in the ravine gun in hand the mouth was almost choked by a huge boulder bridger rounded this with reckless indifference then checked his mount to a sliding halt for beyond him at the head of the cut in plain sight stood ace--broadside to his mas- ter because the thief hearing the clatter of hoofs had instantly used him for a shield kit bridger flung himself from the saddle advanced a few steps and halted he called out scornfully come out from behind that horse yuh dirty cow- ard step aside to the right a couple of yards i'll promise yuh an even break but the thief didn't come out bridger snapped yuh damn fool don't yuh know yore legs are showin i can shoot the feet off yuh any min- ute still not a sound nor any movement from the feet kit bridger whistled at the sharp imperious sound a signal he had been sternly trained to obey ace plunged against the reins angered by their restraint he reared pivoted flung his whole weight against the leathers jerking away from the horse-thief he rushed to his master mane and tail floating triumphantly eyes gleaming to the astonishment of bridger curt jones instead of going for his gun had crumpled on the ground gauntleted hands over his face and sobs appar- ently shaking his shoulders for a second kit bridger looked in amazed contempt at the desolate figure then he realized this couldn't be curt  ranch romances jones--probably some mexican boy who had been hired to rustle the stallion he called out impatiently get up yuh young coyote and come here i'm not goin to hurt yuh now i've got the horse the figure rose came warily toward him his amazement deepened as he saw the pale tear-wet face of molly wardell kit bridger jammed his gun back into its holster and strode toward her the two stood looking into each other's eyes for pete's sake he demanded roughly what's the answer to all this lin's death she answered strug- gling against the sobs in her throat now yuh've got the horse he'll have to die where's the rest of yore gang his voice was harsh angry there never was anyone but me no one else cared enough to take any risks yuh mean he asked his eyes widening in sheer amazement that yuh were going alone with my horse to swap him--or fancying yuh could swap him--for lin derry she nodded assent it's all spoiled now she muttered she swayed he fancied she was about to fall sprang forward and swept her into his arms with a rush of pitying tenderness yuh brave little fool the unexpected sympathy of his tone the gentleness and strength combined in his clasp suddenly weakened her gal- lant courage against her enemy's shoulder she rested quietly too worn from the tense anxiety and fatigue of the past few days to marvel at her own reaction her hat held by its thong had fallen back on her shoulder kit bridger looked down on the ruffled glory of her hair her face was hidden now against his shoulder poor kid she loved this lin he thought as he himself had once idealized and loved a woman only to find that love mocked and betrayed molly he said gently we'll camp here a bit we both need some food and here's a spring handy let's try not to think of anythin right now but restin the horses and gettin a little grub our- selves she raised her head nodded bravely accepting with forced composure the task of helping him prepare the meal she noted with a bitter little sigh that he had taken no chances on her grab- bing the stallion after all both horses were hobbled and left to graze clean outside the mouth of the ravine where they could find sweet grasses along the meanderings of the spring's stream she felt revived and strengthened as the meal progressed not only by the food and drink but by some subtle stim- ulus she felt from his presence kit bridger himself was strangely dis- turbed the charm and challenge of this girl her amazing courage her love- liness stirred new depths in his being he had hated lin derry before in an impatient casual way but now his hate of derry was hot that she should be willing to risk her life--and more than her life--for that savage-tempered blun- dering fool he said a trifle hoarsely did yuh fancy that if yuh delivered the stallion to yznaga you yoreself would be allowed to return home a girl as  as beautiful as you i didn't intend that the mexicans should ever know i'm a girl she said naively can't yuh see how carefully i'm dressed to look like a man yuh wouldn't fool any man with eyes in his head molly yo're femi- nine from the top of yore head to the sole of yore feet it sings in that sweet voice of yores and when yuh move--no man could be so graceful you talk like that who hate me i don't hate yuh i wish i did in that case i wouldn't mind yuh calling me what yuh've called yore father and all the men yuh counted as friends of yores--cowards yuh've no right to think them cowards because they didn't want to commit suicide as you tried to do he rose commanding curtly help me get up the horses it's time to be a strange trail  moving quite a ways from here to yore father's house tears sprang again to her eyes they were going home ignominiously and lin down there in mexico she moved a little blindly towards the horses he strode beside her apparently not notic- ing her tears when they were both mounted she on the black he on the gleaming splen- dor of the golden stallion he said curtly beat it home as fast as yuh can tell yore dad i've gone down into mexico i'll see what i can do for lin i'll take the one chance there is of saving him-- not through that precious yznaga but through a little idea of my own she was now as amazed as he had been when she first stood revealed to him in the arroyo then she said in steady quiet tones do yuh think i'd let yuh go down there alone yuh'll do just what i tell yuh he countered savagely get going beat it for a moment she stared full into his eyes then slowly she turned the black and rode north he himself struck south and tried to keep from glancing in her direction again he did not turn his head for half a mile until he was out of the gorge and riding along a plain then looking back he saw molly on the black horse calmly following him he drove her back she obeyed him with the same meekness she had shown before but no sooner had he put some distance between them than looking back he again discovered her following when he had driven her back in vain for the third time he rode to meet her and looked at her with mingled respect admiration and exasperation it's no use she said smiling i'm going along--let's say as a boy yuh've hired she added hurriedly as she saw the frown between his eyes darkening ominously i'll mind every word yuh say if yuh tell me to hide in the bushes i'll hide and yuh fight all the mexicans yuh want alone he couldn't help grinning yo're not all there he said a lunatic with yuh is better than nothing and if yuh keep on turning me back yuh'll only waste a lot of time he groaned then suddenly said sav- agely if yuh don't turn back as i'm tellin yuh if yuh don't go straight to yore father i'll ride home myself lack- ing ace yuh couldn't do anythin oh yes i could she said steadily i can go and beg for lin's life and if that's all i can do i'll do that god knows you are crazy but come on only if yuh disobey a single order of mine-- i give yuh leave to beat me she said almost gaily mile after mile slipped beneath the feet of their horses as they moved steadily south night fell night passed day after day night after night slipped by like black beads on a chain of terror or so they should have been yet somehow strangely enough they went only too fast for these two who thought they would never again be to- gether they had good luck on the weather and good luck in being able to buy grain now and then at some isolated hamlet some time ago they had left the rio behind them and now were pushing down into that ancient dangerous country which never knows real peace kit's fluent mexican spanish was a great help to them but the beauty of the stallion and his striking color were always a danger yet for one thing kit was thankful the magnificence of his horse drew the eyes of the greedy on- lookers away from the seeming youth who rode beside him and she continued to pass for a boy it seemed to bridger now that he had known her always and he said to him- self with sudden bitterness had loved her always but that love would per- haps not torment him long he had a hunch he would be killed down there in releasing lin derry and grimly he  ranch romances said to himself maybe it was better so for he realized with every passing hour that he who seemed to be master on this journey was in reality body and soul captive to molly wardell at last just as night was closing in there appeared before them the lights of the mexican town they sought it lay in a small valley around which swept frowning cliffs the place was open to access in only two directions this in- cluded the trail they were following now they halted above the town looking down upon it here they would remain kit bridger explained until two o'clock and he elaborated fully the plan he had in mind falling back among the thick trees they made themselves as comfor- table as they could gave the horses what little grain remained at the cantles and settled down to waiting bridger now told her that he knew this section well he himself had been down here buying cattle before this re- cent revolution had broken out hour after hour passed through a little vista in the trees molly saw the lights of the town go out one after the other and suddenly it seemed to her that those lights had been stars of hope --hope that was now cruelly vanishing she had pitted kit bridger not only against the people of the town--the jailer the sentinel sure to be outside-- she had also pitted him against yznaga and all his men wrapped in her terror and pity for lin she had thought of nothing else but now she did think most fully of kit bridger's side of the game and it suddenly came upon her like a chill wave how right her father had been she and kit were sitting on the ground beside each other leaning against a ledge of rock one small hand flew out in the starlit darkness and caught bridger's hand in a quick con- vulsive clasp her sweet voice hoarse with anxiety murmured brokenly star- tling him by its emotion i'm sending yuh to yore death it's all useless and terrible lin brought this on himself i see now how right dad was there's no use in yore dying too  let's turn back bridger knew instinctively that she was not thinking of herself in all the misery and distress she had suffered during the past days her frantic anxiety had been always for someone else bridger's arm went round her crush- ing her close to his side his own voice was hoarse with feeling molly i never dreamed of a girl like you but quit worrying believe that i'll put it through and if i don't  and if yuh don't she shivered   then remember yore promise to me he said yuh'll cut out for home as fast as ever ace can carry yuh another hour and now the sentinel at the jail sullenly wondered why the relief on his beat was late was juan drinking again had he forgotten he was due here now if only this gringo dog there in the jail had been shot at once as he should have been the jail would have been empty and no sentinel work would have to be done his reflections were broken by the clear call of a quail which came from a fringe of bushes near the broken-down wall of the jail yard something must have disturbed the bird to make it call at night thought the sentinel if only it would come into the open and he could see its small body moving along he might be able to kill it with a rock he was very fond of quail he wouldn't dare to fire at it for that would alarm the town he moved a little nearer to the fringe of bushes his whole mind bent upon get- ting the quail which had come so op- portunely to break the maddening mo- notony of his beat the quail whistled boldly it was coming nearer still softly he laid down his rifle and reached for a small stone then as he flattened out on the ground like a dead bat astride of him dropped kit bridger warning him in spanish not to utter a sound a strange trail  now listen whispered kit close to the fellow's ear yuh'll rise yuh'll go to the jail door knock loudly and say there's a messenger out here from general yznaga to see the jailer obey an yuh won't be hurt fail in the slightest degree dog and yuh die señor señor whispered the senti- nel quite distinctly i have no desire to die i will obey every word that the sñnor commands disturbed by the loud pounding on the jail door the jailer arose sullenly and demanded through it who is there what do you desire glibly enough the sentinel explained just as he had been told to do the jailer shrugged no doubt yznaga was about to execute the gringo privately and a good thing if he did thought the jailer he opened the door and ad- mitted both the sentinel and the man whom he supposed to be the messenger beyond them in the furthest cell of the jail lin derry heard that knocking and interpreted it just as the jailer had done he was about to die yznaga was weary of keeping him he had broken his pledge to give curt jones time to return with the stallion but no there had been time and there had been no stallion at last in humiliation and despair lin derry had begun to realize how lit- tle he had taught men to value him how unlikely it was not only that kit bridger would be willing to part with his horse but also how most unlikely that any mass rescue would be at- tempted--especially in the present state of ferment in mexico if he had only kept his head about those lousy cattle but then when in the past few years had he ever kept his head well he was about to die and he would die bravely he heard the tramp of approaching feet folded his arms threw back his head and standing beside his window bravely faced the opening door his pale blue eyes quite steady his full passion- ate lips firm in this hour derry wore a real dignity but it vanished as he stepped forward to meet not yznaga's soldiers but the amazing presence of kit bridger--his enemy he knew instantly that bridger had not come here to do him any harm that was not necessary bridger would only have needed to leave that to the scant time remaining before derry faced execution the jailer and the sentinel are in the jailer's office knocked out and gagged explained bridger curtly here's a belt and gun for yuh follow me close i've got horses    damn it don't waste time thankin me be quiet he hurried derry on before him out of the jail door locked it and thrust the keys into his own belt in the shadow of the bushes fringing the trail the amazed derry saw not two horses but three the central one was ace the golden stallion with molly riding him on each side of her was a led horse these were fresh animals which kit bridger had picked out of yznaga's own remuda grazing in a paddock nearby re- flecting ironically to himself that both he and molly were horse-thieves now lin derry broke out into exclama- tions at sight of molly again kit bridger savagely cut him off they mounted hurriedly and were about to turn north when bridger halted them listen a detail of mounted men probably yznaga's was coming southward along the trail they should be on at bridger's order each rider leaned forward put- ting a swift hand over the nostrils of his horse then suddenly the horse lin derry rode reared in fright a man broke out from the thick scrub near him rushed toward the jail yelling and firing his gun as he went it was the relief the missing juan who should have been there half an hour ago but who as pedro had surmised had stopped for an extra drink yet he was not too drunk to realize that the gringo prisoner was escaping they could no longer ride north they must escape through the south exit bridger knew at his word of  ranch romances command the horses sprang forward and they raced past the demoralized sentinel who was battering vainly on the jail door on into the sleeping town they went where lights already were beginning to spring up dogs were barking wildly clamor and confusion coming to light everywhere the maudlin condition of the relief sentinel had saved them from any bul- lets from his gun but now as they thundered through the town more than one rifle snarled more than one bullet sung past them the detail of soldiers would of course gallop to the jail first and would undoubtedly have sense enough to realize that the three on horseback would make for the south exit since they had been cut off from the north molly felt thankful when they were past the clamor of the village somehow she didn't mind the bullets as much as she minded the wild barking of the dogs there was something sinister in their chorus as though they presaged certain death at the furious pace they were keep- ing it did not take them long to arrive at the second exit prehistoric forces had torn a gaping rent in the mountain if that rent had been deeper a river would have flowed into the valley would have made a lake where the town lay now but the rent was not deep enough and the river outside the pass shouldered close by it cutting off all exit except for the bridge ramshackle and so narrow horses must pass over it in defile the walls of the river pitched sheer down on the town side opposite fifty yards beyond the bridge was a place where a horse might scramble out they thundered across but on the other bank kit bridger paused molly and lin derry watched him with anx- ious curiosity hell snarled lin derry what yuh hangin round here for yznaga's men will be on that bridge in a few minutes it's bad enough for yuh to have dragged a girl like molly into this without riskin her life any more than yuh can help lin cried molly angrily let me tell yuh-- but kit bridger cut them both off short leave him alone molly what difference does it make what he thinks i want yore riatas--or wait i want yore horse this one i'm ridin has speed plenty of it but i'll need my stallion's strength for what i'm goin to do give me the riata on yore saddle derry--and the one from yores molly he added for they had now exchanged horses that gives me three i think i can swing what i'm after now molly yuh promised to obey orders beat it you and lin oh kit wailed the girl i'd rather-- damn yuh almost snarled kit bridger will yuh go she turned and galloped away the rhythm of her horse's feet mingling with her sobbing galloping alongside of her lin derry gazed at her his hate of kit bridger deepening with every moment that bridger had saved him only made things much worse he would not dare to quarrel again with kit bridger lin derry felt no hell could be worse than posing as grateful to the man he wanted to kill and yet such a pose he would be forced to keep they were topping a small rise now disobedient molly halted and looked back her face went white she gasped lin look he's gone back over the bridge oh god lin what's he do- ing unwillingly enough lin derry halted beside her they both wheeled their horses and sat looking toward the river i know what he's doin growled lin the supports on the town side of that bridge are rotten ace is as strong as two ordinary horses this fellow bridger is aimin to drag the main sup- port out from under the bridge and wreck it he mustn't he shan't stop there a strange trail  almost screamed molly i'm going over there and make him come with us lin derry's hand shot out and caught her rein stay where yuh are he snarled see--i told yuh he's made a dutch collar out of the third riata to strengthen the horse's chances let go my rein shrieked molly or i'll cut it with a curse lin derry let loose of it and like a whirlwind she galloped back toward the bridge with lin at her side as they reached it the gleaming magnificent body of the stallion was straining forward in a lunging powerful pull kit bridger beside him urging him on with his voice and a slight touch of his quirt kit screamed the girl for god's sake kit he did not hear her heart and soul he was bent on his task for which he had little time if it were to be accom- plished the soldiers of yznaga were already firing at the rear yelling as they came but now an encouraging cracking sound came from the rotten main sup- port of the bridge on that side for years it had been in bad condition for years the town had known it should be mended but always it was to be done mañana and now thanks to that dila- tory attitude the rotten wood suddenly gave way the town side of the bridge crashed into the water but bullets were whistling like hail around the destroyer of the town's causeway kit had no time to loosen the bridge riatia he cut it with the flash of his knife then whirled the stal- lion toward the unfordable sheer bank driving in his spurs molly hid her eyes as man and horse arched into the air below kit bridger lay a pool how deep it was he did not know if it were too shallow both he and the stallion would die if it were deep enough    the failing horse hit the center of the water with a tremendous splash flying spray seemed to hide them both al- though in reality it was the water which hid them the pool was very deep and man and horse went completely under they rose and on the shelving side of the pool nearest molly passed into shallow water and made for the break on the bank where they might scramble out toward that break molly galloped wildly for rifle fire was pouring around kit bridger and she saw no chance for him whatever in that moment she felt that she would share death with him gladly yet he came out unscathed and in five minutes the yelling cursing mob of soldiery in the rear could be heard no longer we've got a fighting chance now kit bridger announced by the time they get back to the north exit and cut around to where we are we'll have had a start of miles the river isn't fordable again until yuh've gone a long way yo're sure yo're not shot any- where yo're not hit at all persisted molly anxiously it seems impossible that yuh weren't-- i'm not hurt reiterated kit bridger then sharply but somebody else is look he wheeled his horse around her as she was riding between them and caught lin derry just as he was slip- ping from the saddle dismounting he laid derry at length on the sod tore open his shirt and with a start of surprise wondered that he had kept the saddle as far as he had gone there was a gaping wound in his chest he must have been caught by the gun- fire as they were leaving the town lin derry looked up i'm goin molly they got me    kiss    she bent above him her lips touched his just as his last sigh came ahead of them lay a long and cruel trail they could not stop to bury lin nor could they carry him for days and nights ahead kit bridger said gently that on the trail he would pay the mexi- cans at some hamlet to go back and do for them and for lin what they could not do now there followed long days long nights  ranch romances of desperate riding of twisting and turning and then like a miracle the rio grande appeared back on american soil the tension lifted as they rode along molly said slowly kit i know now that the love i had for poor lin was the kind a sister gives to her brother not the kind i feel for    she broke off flushing he pressed his horse close to hers his arm went round her shoulder draw- ing her toward him not the kind that yuh'll give kit bridger who's goin to be yore husband he announced firmly she sighed happily he added with a grin but thinkin of all the times yuh've disobeyed me molly i reckon yo're goin to make a plumb disobedient wife the puncher's slogan by  s omar barker laugh and the world laughs with you weep and you weep alone but you ain't got time fer neither straddlin a bronco roan every cloud's got silver fer linin says the poet-- bouncin on top of a bronco who's got time to

fer the puncher git on im boy an ride the girl and the guitar by  c wiles hallock here's ol pete carberry well known hereabouts as a first-class matchmaker although he claims to be top-hand to cupid things ain't always as smooth along the path of love as pete would like to make them when i joined up with jared arrondale's outfit over in elko county i had hopes of fulfillin a long-cherished dream as far back as i kin remember i've nursed a ardent yearnin to play on the guitar waal--young jerry arrondale was one of the highfalutinest guitar-twangers ever i heard bein as i was foreman of the arrondale spread with jerry my top-hand i figgered mebbe my crave to strum the spanish fandango and juan- iter and other heart-warmin tunes would be realized but i guess fate didn't decree for me to twang guitar strings though jerry seemed willin enough to give me les- sons when i asked him we was ridin over pardo way one bright may mornin to see if there was some cattle cars on the railway sidin there jerry'd been playin and singin in the bunkhouse the night before and a rip-roarin time was had by all --ranch romances--first sept   ranch romances i shore admire the way you wrangle the guitar laddie says i it's down- right inspirin the way you render that spanish cavalier ballad heck pete tain't nothin to speak about says jerry grinnin broad and flushin up he was a big brawny ran- nigan with curly black hair and flashin blue eyes it's plumb scrumptious if you ask me says i boy almost since child- hood's earliest hour i've had me a se- cret longin to whang on a guitar like you do s'pose you could learn me to strum a few ditties jerry let out a roarin laugh you're durned tootin i could you old mav- erick he yelps if you got a ear for music i can learn you to play chords and you can set and howl home on the range and the cowboy's lament to a fare-you-well i'll start workin on you tonight after supper but as luck would have it we come joggin past the district schoolhouse just then and less'n a second after jerry spoke two piercin screams split the ozone we wheeled our hosses round and before we was out of our saddles nine young'uns come shriekin from the schoolhouse follered by the teacher what's up yelled jerry runnin to'rds em with me right at his heels a snake cried the teacher wide- eyed and tremblin with terror a huge rattler--coiled up behind the stove she swayed and would've fell in a heap if jerry hadn't gripped her arms she was all aquiver so jerry just lifted her in his arms and carried her to a bench under a big pine tree in the school yard just set quiet and calm yourself he said puttin her on the bench and fan- nin her with his hat i'll tend to mister snake says i rushin into the schoolhouse shore nuff there was a reptile coiled up be- hind the stove but twasn't no rattler so i picked it up and went to the door and yelled your visitor ain't no rattlesnake miss just a bullsnake--plumb harm- less i hated to kill the pore thing but i knowed that pretty schoclma'am would worry herself sick wonderin if it might come back again so i took it up into a little gully behind the schoolhouse and done away with it the little boys fol- lered and watched me bury it when i come back to the tree jerry was settin on the bench beside the little lady gazin with admirin eyes at the glossy sheen of her dark wavy hair hope you're feelin better now miss he said you needn't have been scared though them reptiles is meek and gentle--they keep the rattlers away anyhow that one won't never bother you no more i chimed in thank you a thousand times she said in tremblin tones givin us a flashin smile she had big brown eyes with a pleadin lingerin glow in em that made you ketch your breath when she leveled em straight at you guess we'd ought to interduce our- selves said jerry risin up i'm jerry arrondale from the arrondale ranch southeast of here--and this here's pete carberry i bowed to the lady i am ruth woodstock she said blushin pretty i don't know how to thank you gentlemen for your timely assistance you don't have to thank us for nothin cried jerry i'm mighty glad to know you miss woodstock he laughed hearty you was plenty up- set i was near fainting said the girl it was silly of me say i don't blame you a-tall cried jerry i get shaky just like you did when i meet up with a rattler he set down beside her again the little lady give him one of her pleadin looks smilin gorgeous he gazed into her big brown eyes and sighed looked like they was hypnotizin each other to anybuddy that's been mixed up in as many match- makin contracts as what i've been it was a plain case of mutual beguilement the girl and the guitar  you might say it was one of them times when three is a crowd so i says think i'll go take a look around mebbe i kin find the place where that varmint got in at come on kids let's investigate i went in the school with all the little folks follerin me and it didn't take me long to locate a big knot-hole in the floor right back of the stove so i plugged it up with a willow saplin jerry and miss woodstock was at the door when i finished the job i'm quite myself now she said so i must get back to school-teaching she shook hands with us cordial sayin thank you again for killing the snake--and i am pleased to have met you the way she smiled into jerry's eyes i knowed she was more'n half hopin she'd have some more snake trouble and he'd come ridin by again just in the nick of time i'm lopin down to elko to fetch mail said jerry is there anything i could bring you comin back no thanks she said real sweet good-by so long mebbe--mebbe i'll stop by anyhow says jerry she just laughed and went inside now we hadn't had no intentions of foggin down to elko which it was clean out of our way the lad was tryin to figger out some excuse for callin on the little lady again so i says i'll go and see about them cattle cars whilst you're lopin after the mail and you might inquire in regards to miss woodstock's mail too might be she's expectin a important letter which you could deliver it to her pete you're a smart feller he chuckles a very smart feller indeed he give me a wink and went dustin down the road to'rds elko singin school days school days dear ol golden rule days that night after supper jerry didn't make no move to git out his guitar and start learnin me how to pluck chords when the other boys asked him to play a few tunes he begged off sayin he didn't feel good course i knowed what was eatin on him so i follered him when he up and charged out of the bunkhouse waal boy says i did you find any important letters for miss wood- stock down to elko no i didn't says he sighin heavy if there'd been any mail for her i could have rode up to the schoolhouse and seen her again and mebbe got bet- ter acquainted with her and found out where she lives but i didn't have nerve enough to just drop in on her empty- handed gosh that little gal gets to me pete she shore gets to me he sighed like a dyin calf yeah i noticed says i but how am i gonna manage he groans what d'you mean says i i mean you gotta help me figger out some way to see her again i can't go callin on her less i got some good reason for showin up and besides i gotta have some excuse to git away from the ranch or else dad'll land all over me for not bein on the job can't you figger out some good excuse for sendin me over pardo way and also a reason for droppin in on miss wood- stock after i find out where she lives i can call on her of evenin's but until then--you see what i mean i'm ketchin on says i but if i know anything about the meanin of a gal's tender glances that little teacher'd be plumb delighted to see you if you didn't have no more cause to knock on her door than just to ask for a drink of water i kin manage gittin you away from here okeh providin you don't abuse the privilege i gotta do right by your dad and the rest of the hands-- you know that just gimme one privilege pete says he with tears in his voice i'll work extra hard to make up for it all right says i i'll think up some way to git you and your teacher together meanwhile you go back to the bunkhouse and give the boys a treat with your guitar-playin  ranch romances so he went and hauled out his guitar and sang and played for us but he didn't put his heart into it his thoughts was all wanderin over pardo way and instead of givin us merry upliftin dit- ties he drummed and droned out mel- ancholy strains such as in the gloamin and nellie was a lady and you made me wot i am today i hope yo're satisfied    now i was plumb eager to boost along this buddin romance cause the one thing in life i admire equal with buckarooin is bein top-hand and round- up boss for dan cupid so i made up my mind to sort of scout ahead and pave the way for this pair there was a rambunctious steer on the spread plumb ornery and worthless cept for rodeo- showin purposes which was the only reason why old man arrondale kept him around he was kept in a pasture lot close by the corrals and every now and again he'd ram through the fence and go rangin so i ambled over to the pasture lot that night before retirin busted the fence chased the critter out and run him a ways in the direction of pardo next mornin i says to old man ar- rondale old pandemonium's broke loose again i don't aim to take none of the hands off their chores to round him up though i'll go git him myself the old man growled some but didn't put up no argument i forked my bronc and started off jerry come foggin after me where you headin says he lookin terrible woebegone i'm workin on a scheme says i i'm gonna fix things so's you kin call on your lady friend tomorrow now-- say d'you s'pose you could mebbe start learnin me a thing or two about guitar-twangin this evenin oh shore he boomed i'd plumb forgot i'll learn you to play the g chord tonight gosh i kin see her to- morrow huh yep--shore as shootin says i dustin away i was all excited myself thinkin bout learnin to play that there g chord i headed northwest to'rds pardo and hunted all over for that dang- rammed steer but didn't see hide nor hair of him i got to the schoolhouse bout noon when the kids come out to play and eat their lunches under the big pine tree i went up and banged on the door the little teacher seemed right glad to see me you ain't seen nothin of a ornery- lookin steer rangin round these parts have you says i no i haven't she says smilin sweet i didn't s'pose you had says i but i thought i'd stop in and ask if you'd had any more reptile trouble no we haven't seen any more snakes says she laughin merry come in mr carberry i'm just eat- ing my lunch won't you share this piece of cake with me i'd admire to set and chat with you a few minutes says i goin inside but i couldn't take your cake thanks now if it was jerry stead of me he couldn't resist your temptin offer he's terrible fond of sweets miss woodstock's cheeks turned a shade pinker and that pleadin lingerin glow come into her eyes when i men- tioned jerry's name how's the school work comin along says i whilst i was talkin i slipped my gauntlets off and hung em on one of the rungs of the chair i was settin on most of the children are doing very well mr carberry says she they're nice youngsters so we re getting along just fine we've been extra busy this week preparing an entertainment pro- gram for next friday afternoon it's a very thrilling experience for the children i'm bettin it would be thrillin to see them young'uns perform says i i'm afraid they aren't going to have an audience says miss woodstock their parents are too busy to take an interest in such things them words give me a sudden bright the girl and the guitar  idear say i says if it's a audience you crave i know a couple of parties you could count on i and jerry would come a-whoopin if you was to invite us do you really mean it cried the gal flushin up i shore do says i what's more if you was to crave some extra-special entertainin for your program you could git jerry to give the young'uns a very nice surprise and i told her bout his guitar-playin say you oughta hear him twang them strings and warble la palomy and when the harvest days is over jessie dear oh mr carberry--that would be gr-a-and cries the little lady clappin her hands do you think jerry--er mr arrondale--would do it miss woodstock says i very sol- emn jerry would do anything in the world for you when you git to know him real good you'll find he's a won- derful young feller he'll be tickled pink to play his guitar on your program-- take my word for it oh sighed the little lady then she laughed and her eyes glowed like stars she picked up a piece of her cake and wrapped it up careful in a paper napkin here she cried holdingthe cake out to me take this to mr jerry with my very best wishes tell him i invite him to the school program friday afternoon --and say i implore him to bring his guitar and play for me and the chil- dren she laughed beautiful i shore will says i and you can count on him comin he'll be here-- guitar and all of course you're invited too she cried as i went out thanks kindly says i mebbe jerry might be over this way tomorrow mebbe he might stop in and talk over the program with you i hope so she said with a deep sigh and a dazzlin smile i think that would be fine as i piled into my saddle she cried good-by i hope you find your cow i went lookin for pandemonium down elko way figgered i might as well pick up the mail bein i was so near to town i didn't run acrost the crazy steer but it didn't worry me none twasn't no killin matter if he did run around loose for a spell when i got to elko i blowed into mike leary's refreshment parlor before goin to the post office to git me a lemon sody whilst i was guzzlin it a feller come in and bought a pack of cigarettes he was a total stranger to mike and me--a middle-aged mean-lookin party with slicked black hair and dressed like a big town dude also he was likkered up tighter'n a tick where'sh the post office he growled swayin back and forth down the street a coupla blocks says i i'm goin there pretty soon-- i'll show you where tis here he says pullin a letter out of his pocket mail this he handed me the missive and staggered out with- out so much as a thank you okeh stranger says i shovin the letter into my hip pocket that maverick's been snoopin round here since mornin says mike he don't belong in nevady--not in these parts anyhow i went and got the mail after chinnin with mike a few minutes then lit out for home i looked careful for pande- monium but he wasn't nowheres around that night right after supper jerry and me took a walk and i give him the piece of cake miss woodstock sent to him which it was kind of mashed up account of me havin to carry it in the breast pocket of my shirt and also i give him the gal's message gosh pete says the lad all choked up i don't know how i kin ever make it up to you for what you've done for me shucks boy says i all you gotta do is learn me somethin about guitar- twangin i'd admire to git started on that g chord you said you'd show me next payday i'm gonna lope over to  ranch romances elko and buy me the best durned guitar i kin find so we went to the bunkhouse and he got out his insterment and showed me how to hold it then he told me the names of the strings and showed me how to press the two outside strings down on the third fret with my left hand and pluck with my right that there's the first position of the g chord he said you practise on it awhile pluck gentle--don't pull the strings out by the roots twasn't near as easy to do as it looked but it shore was fun it got me so excited i was all lathered up with perspiration i yanked my handkerchief out of my hip pocket to mop my brow somethin else popped out and fell onto the floor like a flash i remembered about the letter that dude stranger gave me to mail--and i'd forgot to do same i picked it up looked at it--and almost fell off my bunk when i seen the name on the envelope it was addressed to miss woodstock what in thunder does it mean asked jerry when i told him how i come by it it means you've gotta deliver this letter to the little lady when you see her tomorrow says i in regards to the sneaky party which give it to me i'm bettin hosses to hotcakes she ain't nowise to blame for havin to git it but it ain't none of our business--and it ain't nothin for you to git all wrought up over neither i picked up the guitar and started practisin that first position of the g chord again that was just as far as i ever got learnin to play the guitar jerry just set gloomin over that danged letter too upset to pay any more attention to me that night and things that transpired from then on kept him from ever givin me any more lessons next mornin jerry went over to the pardo schoolhouse i told his dad i'd sent him out lookin for old pandemo- nium which i wasn't lyin outright cause i'd asked the boy to keep his eye peeled for the steer when he got back long about mid-afternoon i jumped my hoss and we rode away from the other hands so's he could say what he craved to tell me gosh a'mighty pete he yelped that ornery hombre is pesterin miss woodstock some way she was terri- ble upset when she read that there let- ter she got pale as a ghost and she was tremblin when she finished readin it so i told her if she was needin any help she could count on me to stand by her through thick and thin what did she say to that says i she said i was sweet he muttered colorin up and she patted my hand and she's gonna pull off that there pro- gram tomorrow afternoonstead of fri- day i'm bettin it was on account of the danged letter that she changed the date cause she said she feared friday was gonna be an unlucky day for her that bein the case says i me and you'll hafta scout around the pardo schoolhouse on friday cause if that tough dude i seen down to elko is on the little lady's trail she'll be needin help d'you know where she lives yeah--at the rudolph ranch a mile west of pardo did you see anything of my gaunt- lets yeah i brung em to you he handed em over which i'd left em at the school on purpose just to give him an excuse for stoppin by sometime when he couldn't think of no good rea- son for doin same at one-thirty o'clock thursday afternoon the lad and me was set- tin side by side on the platform in the pardo schoolhouse all ready for the show jerry looked terrible solemn with his arms folded acrost his chest and his face flamin red miss woodstock was dressed up pretty and she shore was a picture standin at her desk whilst the little folks filed in and took their places but she was pale and nervous and showed plain enough that she was al- mighty worried bout somethin she rapped on her desk and said the girl and the guitar  children we are very pleased of course to have guests with us today who have come to hear our program i'm sure you all remember mr carberry and mr arrondale who so kindly helped us the other morning with the snake when she said them words me and jerry rose up and bowed and whilst we was bowin an ornery little red-headed kid in the back of the room whispered loud enough for everybuddy to hear teacher's got a feller the room rang with uproar'ous mirth me and jerry set and miss ruth rapped for order again we will start the pro- gram at once she said speakin so sharp that the laughin stopped as sud- den as it started we will stand and sing our opening song so the kids stood up and sang amer- ica right lusty which jerry and me joined in and the pretty school teacher looked pleased waal--after the patriotic salute a boy bout fourteen come for'ard and spoke a very excitin piece called the charge of the light brigade he was a ganglin youth but talented he waved his arms and shouted and made a big to-do tellin bout six hundred soldiers that got wiped out in death valleywhich it was all news to me and got me quite some wrought up then two or three others sang songs and spoke pieces an miss woodstock said now children i have a very grand surprise for you mr arrondale is go- ing to entertain us with some music he will play his guitar and sing for us it was very kind of mr arrondale to take part in our program and i'm sure we will show our appreciation by keep- ing perfectly still she give jerry a sweet smile he was all a-tremble with flusteration but he done himself proud playin the spanish fandango the young uns clapped and cheered and miss woodstock give the lad such a sweet yearnin look he almost bust into tears so then he played and sang the spanish cavalier very sad and tender gazin straight at the little lady all the while but when he was right in the middle of the glide waltzthere come a loud knock on the door jerry stopped miss ruth's face went white excuse me mr arrondale she murmured i believe we have an- other visitor she was all a-tremble as she passed in front of us to open the door but before she reached it the door swung open and a big feller scowl- in grim as thunder come stridin in it was the dude stranger i'd met up with down to elko he was one of the meanest lookin hombres ever i see without so much as a glance at jerry and me he follered the frightened little lady to her desk get my letter he snarled glarin at the pore gal

ruth turned to the children we will not be able to finish our pro- gram she said i am very sorry school is dismissed--now please go-- all of you--at once the kids got up and straggled out the tough party turned to me and jerry for the first time and snarled you can go too get out mr bardonni-- cried the little teacher but jerry spoke up before she could finish we're takin orders from the lady he said cool and calm but his eyes was flashin danger mr bardonni these gentlemen are friends of mine cried miss ruth i'd advise you to address them civilly furthermore i'm not going to denver or anywhere else with you--and that's final the tough hombre walked over to us  ranch romances and stood within two feet of jerry sneerin insolent we was on the plat- form bout a foot higher than him who

him sprawlin miss ruth screamed then jerry was on top of the sprawlin bully with one knee on his chest he gripped the bully's right hand and twisted the gun from his clutch he tossed the gun onto the desk shoutin here ruth--a souvenir for you then he jerked the bully up onto his feet and smashed him again knockin him clean over a row of desks the bully just laid limp--he was plumb out and there was me standin by the desk watchin the battle plumb dazed and huggin jerry's guitar to my buz- zom then i heard a moan and miss ruth collapsed on the desk in a dead faint jerry rushed over and gathered the little lady in his arms so i set the guitar down and took charge of the tough customer sprawled on the floor take that bad hombre and do anything you crave to do with him said jerry i took mr bardonni out and tied him onto my hoss with my lariat there was a team and buckboard hitched at the school fence--the rig this hombre mentioned to miss ruth but whilst i was ropin up mr bardonni i heard a hullabaloo of bellerin and snortin and there come old pandemonium the crazy steer down the road he charged straight to'rds the team and buckboard like a demon out of perdition the team busted loose and went streakin down the road to'rds elko so i jumped jerry's bronc and took after pandemonium i roped the crazy critter with jerry's lariat and tied him up to a tree then i got my hoss with the tough dude tied onto him and lit out for elko when we got to town i says lis- ten stranger you're goin back to den- ver tonight only you're goin alone then i took my rope off him and let him go the last i seen of him he was hot-footin it to'rds the depot when i got back to the pardo school- house there was jerry settin on the teacher's desk claspin miss woodstock to his breast her arms was twined round his neck and they was kissin and cooin waal--after jerry seen his future wife home i and him brung old pandemo- nium back to the arrondale ranch it was plenty late on the way jerry ex- plained to me that the bardonni party was a denver pawnbroker and also a bootlegger and gambler the little lady pawned her pianna with him to git money to help her kid brother through college then he forced his intentions on her and was tryin to make her marry him but what's botherin me said jerry is how i'm gonna break the news to dad that ruth is gonna be my bride i promised i'd

my pandemonium yit and when jerry told him we had all right then he boomed i'll let you git married you too pete--if you want now go git your supper a song on the trail by  elsa barker just what are the qualifications for a sheriff's wife should a girl be strong and sturdy or will a dainty little creature do--if she's the right sort and the sheriff likes her down the steep narrow moun- tain trail came a tiny figure on a tall bay mare--the horse stepping along with the dain- tily arched steps of a thoroughbred-- the rider singing head thrown back golden curls blowing in the breeze the voice like the singer was small and dainty and sweet if connie morgan had a care in the world she wasn't going to let it spoil the keen pleasure of her ride she had already come five miles this morn- ing from the tiny log cabin where she had lived the last three summers with her father at the foot of the truchas peaks winters they spent in a big white house in the little town of palomas connie was going in now to make arrangements for opening and clean- ing the town place in another two weeks by the middle of october they would have to be moving before some early snowstorm might pile up its great white drifts across their trail already just the night before they had had a warning flurry and the ground was still white with it connie's father had inherited money   ranch romances and a hobby he had a passion for beautiful horseflesh as his father had had before him next to connie he loved more than anything else in the world his two dozen or so beautiful slim-legged and slender-bodied bays blacks and sorrels racing stock they were from some of the best stables in america occasionally he entered one of them in one of the local races at palomas or vegas as a sort of de- fiant excuse to the world for owning them every spring now for three years he had driven his frolicsome spir- ited pets over the mountain passes to their high summer home where they thrived on the luscious grass another mile down the trail to the canyon bottom and connie would be at the cabin of frenchy arnot ex- cept for their own there was no other cabin for miles in all this vast wilder- ness of high country she'd stop and see if there was any- thing frenchy wanted her to do for him in palomas poor lonesome fear- driven frenchy people had warned her about him they said he was crazy and probably dangerous it ain't noways natural for a body to shut hisself up thataway away from ever'body year in an year out why i even hear tell as how a feller stopped there and wanted to thaw hisself out by the fire one day an frenchy chased him away with a gun like as not he'll get to broodin up there some long winter an kill some- body yes sir i'd keep away frum him if it wuz me garrulous old mrs o'brien who ran the hotel told her connie had smiled at this and other warnings she knew and understood frenchy they'd been good friends since that spring she'd found him pinned under a fallen tree with a broken leg and some smashed ribs in the long idle hours while frenchy's old bones were knitting he'd told her a lot about himself and what he hadn't told her she'd been able to guess it was an old story frenchy had been a chef--a good one--in a big hotel in the east he'd had a son--a bad one through and through--whom he'd loved as men do love an only son the boy joe had gotten into trouble with the police repeatedly and old frenchy had always managed some- how to get him out hoping and half believing each time that this would be the last that now the boy would settle down and behave himself then frenchy tiring finally decid- ed that what the boy needed was a quiet place and plenty of time to think things over the next time there was trouble frenchy sat tight neither putting up the money for bail for his boy nor hiring him a good lawyer what is more when the case came to trial old frenchy appeared as a wit- ness against joe the judge gave the boy five years at hard labor the state had a case without frenchy's testimony and the boy might have been convicted anyway but young joe never believed that he blamed everything on his father after the verdict joe was given a few minutes to say farewell to frenchy he had looked at his father steadily for a minute small black eyes glittering then with demoniacal de- termination in his silky voice he said quietly remember this old man when my five years are up i'm going to kill you unheeding frenchy's quivering gray-white face he had turned and walked away with his guards black head held high--a reckless swagger- ing picture of unconcern it is a hard thing for a man to lose hope entirely for a year after that frenchy had tried to make peace with his boy going to see him once a week carrying delicacies of his own making to him young joe arnot's mother had died in an asylum and he had always been a queer one but now he had changed somehow from a wild care- less youth to a quiet unbalanced man he lived with but a single purpose-- a song on the trail  to kill his father as soon as he was free always he repeated in that soft gentle voice of his the threat he had made the day in the courtroom at last despairing beaten old frenchy had made his way west hid- ing himself year in and year out in his little log cabin high in the sangre de cristo mountains until now after ten years he was known as the queer old man of the mountains yes connie thought she understood frenchy arnot small wonder he chased strangers away from his door with a gun instead of fearing him she pitied him from the depths of her warm generous heart it was a ter- rible thing she thought to see a man loving yet at the same time living in deadly fear of an only son another half mile down the canyon connie drew rein and sat for a min- ute looking at the golden beauty of straight trunked aspens contrasted with white snow and an unbelievably blue sky she loved this wild moun- tain country of hers loved every tree and every curve in the winding old cow and sheep trails loved the tiny cabin nestling at the foot of the rugged truchas peaks connie at sixteen fresh from boarding school in the east had for the first time followed her father across the mountains with the ponies she had slipped quickly and easily into a new life in the west she was nineteen now a tiny perfect rosebud of a girl barely tipping the scales at ninety-five pounds with her sky-blue eyes hair like autumn aspen leaves and long curling lashes she looked like an old-fashioned dresden china doll come to life too much so for her own peace of mind kind-hearted matronly ladies always insisted on mothering her gave her overshoes pestered her about wearing ear muffs and wool stockings their concern was well intentioned but it was just so much poison in connie's cup of happiness cool com- petent self-sufficient little connie hated looking like some fragile deli- cate toy she might have told them things that would have made their eyes open but a girl couldn't go around boasting of things she had done and besides they probably wouldn't have believed her for instance there was that spring she had found frenchy pinned under- neath the top half of a fallen spruce tree she had single-handed managed to rig up a sort of block and tackle and lift the tree top enough to get the old man out then too there was the time she had found a grizzly milling around the horses and her with only one shell in the rifle she was carry- ing she hadn't hesitated her aim was good and her bullet went crashing through his brain of course there was a particular reason why connie didn't want to be just another big-eyed blonde with it that reason was young buck mindon who was sheriff mindon now tall straight as an indian face tanned nut-brown from years of rid- ing the range he had set connie's heart to thumping the first time she saw him she had had reason during those first few months to believe that he might feel the same way about her but their acquaintance had ripened no further than an ordinary friendship in her presence buck mindon seemed suddenly to become reserved yet stubborn feminine instinct told connie that he did or at least he could care for her there had been an unguarded moment at a dance last summer when she had looked up un- expectedly into his face as she swirled by in another man's arms her high heels clipping a gay tattoo on the rough pine floor their eyes had met and clung for an instant then they had lost each other again in the shuttling of the dance connie was no fool she thought she knew why buck mindon seemed to avoid her and she was determined somehow to set things right again  ranch romances buck mindon was young his sal- ary as sheriff was small his wife should he take one would have to do her own housework would even prob- ably be left alone for days at a time on the little ranch where he lived the life of a sheriff's wife is not easy doubtless he thought its work and worry would crush connie make her prematurely old with a queer old- fashioned chivalry he would not ask a toy who looked as if a gust of wind might blow her away to cook and scrub and mend for him connie gritted her teeth all she wanted was a chance to prove with- out telling him so in words that in reality she was both competent and as tough as horsehide she rode on down the canyon eyes pensive but with a firm set to her soft round chin in a few minutes she was in front of frenchy arnot's cabin the cabin a one-room affair was lo- cated about fifty yards to one side of the trail and almost completely hid- den behind great clumps of alder and willow smoke curled lazily out of the stone fireplace chimney with a start of surprise connie noted a rangy deep-chested gray mare browsing lazily on an oak bush a few yards away the horse was a magnifi- cent specimen of the mountainbred animal that can hold a long swinging gait for hours over steep rocky trails and never tire connie was sure she had never seen her before her flanks were wet with sweat and saddle marks still showed on her back but she showed no other signs of fatigue she was not tied and she circled war- ily as the girl rode near who could the visitor be certain- ly no passing cowboy--on a mare frenchy had no friends except con- nie and her father was it possible that    without quite knowing why con- nie felt a strange pang of apprehen- sion she slipped down from the sad- dle and walked to the door nobody answered her gentle knock she glanced at her watch it was nearly noon frenchy would be com- ing in soon he wouldn't mind if she went in and waited for him quickly she opened the door inside all was cleanliness and order a cheer- ful fire blazed merrily in the fireplace frenchy had not been gone long a strange wet leather jacket hung over the back of a chair before the fire and again that sharp stab of fear gripped her she warmed herself before the fire for a few minutes and then began a restless pacing of the room there was a small window in the back with a green shade drawn tightly down to shut out the blinding glare of sun on snow before this connie paused impatiently she flipped up the shade and peered out the window she froze in her tracks one hand crept to her throat and she gave a low choked cry two men stood directly back of the cabin not more than thirty yards away one of them was old frenchy he stood in an attitude of pleading grizzled face quivering shaking hands outstretched the other towered over him dark-bearded face laughing gun in hand at their feet was a newly dug hole in the ground about six feet long by three feet wide connie shivered in the instant she stood there para- lyzed a single shot rang out and old frenchy a spot of red jumping sud- denly out on his forehead crumpled to the ground connie grasped the window ledge for support the room whirled dizzily around her dry-throated she tried to scream and made no sound horror was succeeded by a fury of anger old frenchy had been her friend she'd get his murderer she'd show him he couldn't get away with that stumbling blindly she started across the room to the door sobbing under her breath halfway there she stopped she'd a song on the trail  just remembered something--some- thing that made a difference she didn't have a gun her father had taken her rifle that morning to hunt a bear that had killed one of his colts the night before they had been with- out shells for his gun a heavy old- fashioned blunderbuss connie gave a short half hysterical laugh she had a mental picture of herself--small dainty helpless-look- ing--defying a maniac murderer with- out even a gun to back her up the man was vicious partially crazy the knowledge of a witness to his crime would make him desperate her eyes darted quickly around there was frenchy's - hanging by the fireplace on the homemade deer-foot gun rack hands trembling with haste she levered the gun re- peatedly to see if there were shells in the magazine the gun was empty frantically she searched the room and found none obviously the mur- derer having the upper hand had taken all the shells she must get control of herself must think what to do she did not dare get panicked dropping into the chair before the fireplace she pressed slim white fingers to throbbing tem- ples she knew she had a few minutes yet before the man outside should finish his gruesome task of covering the body there was nothing she could do now to help frenchy except to bring his murderer to justice connie was young and it was the first time she had seen a man die but one look at the dark red hole in his forehead had told her that he was beyond human aid she thought of trying to take the murderer in with frenchy's empty gun reason told her that was foolish she was so tiny and ineffective-look- ing a desperate man would take a chance on her not having nerve enough to pull the trigger she couldn't clear out without the man behind the house knowing some- one had been there the snow had fixed that tracks would give her away even to a man unused to paying attention to such things could she beat him to town dolly her mount was fast but could she hold the pace for ten long gruelling miles her mind contrasted the beau- tiful slender-bodied dolly with the rangy thick-chested gray dolly wouldn't have a chance after the first few miles how about taking both horses con- nie peeped out the side window at the extreme left behind a clump of oaks she saw a gray tail switch she estimated the distance with her eye the gray mare would be within the man's line of vision so taking the gray was out then suddenly the plan sprang to her mind--full grown like minerva from the head of jupiter it was so simple so easy that she smiled yet it would require more courage than any- thing she had ever done before she might not be able to do it and the ruse itself might not work but at least she could try carefully her eyes searched the room she had left no footprints by the little back window she didn't dare pull the shade down again with the man so close she'd have to take a chance on him not noticing that it had been touched quickly she laid the gun back on the rack then quietly she slipped out the door and swung to the saddle with her heart in her mouth she turned dolly easily daintily back onto the trail connie made no at- tempt to hurry her certainly the murderer would see by her tracks that someone had been there almost certainly he would fol- low lest a possible eye witness to his crime should escape to tell the au- thorities what he would do when he caught up with her--well if her plan should work as she hoped there would be no need to worry about that  ranch romances a mile up the next slope on the trail toward town the mare picked up her ears and whinnied connie's heart seemed to stop beating now she told herself do your stuff he's coming icy terror gripped her her throat felt harsh and dry always before this in time of trouble she had need- ed to act quickly without much time for thought or fear now she would know if she had the kind of courage needed to sustain her for long drag- ging minutes--perhaps connie tossed back her head and tried to sing the first few measures of cielito lindo her voice was a husky whispering monotone she swallowed the lump in her throat wet her lips and tried again the result was bizarre and star- tling her voice usually so sweet and true was high now and almost shrill neither was she able always to hit the note she aimed at but it was singing of a sort at least she kept doggedly on until she fin- ished the song she untied from the saddle the little camp hatchet she al- ways carried with her and casually carelessly as she rode beneath an aspen tree chopped off a limb that was hanging over the trail a hun- dred yards farther on she chopped off another next she paused to slash a great white blaze upon the trunk of a trailside fir so she rode on up to the hamilton mesa always aware of that lurking stalking rider behind her yet never daring to give sign of that awareness on top of the mesa she tried an- other song still riding easily hatchet swinging from limber right wrist this time it was the red river val- ley her new effort was a little more successful when she aimed at c she didn't often miss it any farther than b she thought of buck mindon and her voice quivered if this man should shoot her from behind--now--maybe buck would think she was the guile- less little fool she looked just a girl without sense enough to realize her own danger now she was down the trail off the hamilton mesa to the mora pecos river still singing intermittently still nicking off limbs and blazing occasional trees at the mora pecos she stopped to eat her lunch and rest and water dolly connie threw herself down by the creek cowboy fashion and tried to drink but the water choked her now she thought if he's going to do it this is the time i'm in the open an easy shot for two long minutes she lay per- fectly still in the grip of the most utter and complete terror she had ever known if she had just had a gun could just do something that would put an end to this endless watching waiting--waiting for she knew not what at last trembling in every muscle she arose took her lunch cut of the saddle bag and made a pretense of eating as the expected shot still did not come connie grew a little more confident as she swung back into the saddle she played with the idea of making a break for it now as soon as i get under cover of the green timber she told herself i'm going to put my foot on the gas up on the mesa trail a lean dark- haired bearded man watched her intently slowly his body relaxed and he drew a breath of something like relief he looked down at his horse's feet lay a freshly hewn-off limb of an aspen tree he glanced across the canyon again to where a tiny rider on a tall bay mare was just going into the green timber there was the flash of sun on steel as the rider's right arm swung up and down from where he watched he could see a small sprig of some- thing green fall to the ground a song on the trail  a high sweet voice singing a stanza of the incomparable cielito lindo came faintly to his ears a slow triumphant smile spread over his swarthy features just some damn fool kid whackin around he said half aloud queer voice glad i didn't make the mistake of riding up on her and letting her see me there's not a chance that she saw it or she'd a made a run for it i'd better get going if i hurry back i can make it out of these damn hills by tomorrow night and then take a train to california guess i'd better go back the other way and out by santa fe someone in that little town down there might remember later that i came through and start asking questions an hour and a half later it was an excited half sobbing girl who tumbled off a tall bay mare into the arms of sheriff mindon himself she gasped out her story incoherently be- tween sobs and gulps buck mindon's arms tightened around her just a minute now con- nie he said gently let me get this straight what is it you saw i saw--i saw--a man kill frenchy --frenchy arnot you know--the old prospector who lives near us murder connie or was it a--a fight connie shuddered it was just plain murder--in cold blood frenchy didn't even have a gun he begged for his life but the man just laughed his name's joe arnot--frenchy's son i know because frenchy told me all about him--even showed me his pic- ture when did you see this killing-- today she nodded then how did you-- buck min- don glanced from dolly to the tiny figure in his arms he paled suddenly beneath his tan you witnessed a murder and the killer let you get away didn't he follow you did he try to hurt you connie before she had time to answer he shook her al- most fiercely tell me he said harshly did he hurt you she shook her golden head no i--i don't think he knew i saw it they were behind frenchy's cabin i saw them out the back window i didn't even have a gun buck and i couldn't think of anything else to do so i just slipped out and came along as if nothing had happened i even sang a little as i rode and whacked off limbs of trees you see i thought if i could act natural and unhurried enough that he'd believe i hadn't seen him i guess i fooled him too because he didn't follow any farther than the mora pecos i suppose he thought that be- cause i was a woman that i'd have screamed and tried to run away if i'd seen the murder for a long minute buck mindon stood silent a new light of compre- hension mingling with the anxiety in his eyes his hands shook a little as he dropped his arms and stepped back he smiled down at her with lips that were still a little white and grim i must be going now connie i'll make it back to frenchy's tonight and get on the trail i ought to catch him early in the morning shall i take you over to mrs o'brien first she managed a tremulous little laugh no i'm all right now i'm sorry i acted like a baby you'll--you'll be careful won't you buck don't take any chances with him he's danger- ous buck mindon looked at her grave- ly i won't be taking any chances-- now he promised connie watched him clatter down the street and then turned wearily toward the hotel she spent a restless sleepless night this must be what it's like to be a sheriff's wife she told herself as the long minutes dragged by the next morning she was up early  ranch romances and downstairs her face showed signs of what she had been through deep violet shadows circled her eyes and her cheeks were drawn and colorless she kept watching the hands of her wrist watch time seemed endless buck should be back with his prisoner by ten or eleven she wanted to go over to the sheriff's office and wait for them but she was afraid buck had had a night in which to think it over why had she weakened yesterday lost her nerve and cried so when he put his arms around her suppose he had decided that after all she didn't have the stuff for a westerner's wife connie didn't think she could stand it if he should look at her again in the old cool friendly way about eleven o'clock she saw him crossing the street toward the hotel one arm in a sling somehow she knew by his stride that he had got his man in a panic she got up and crossed to a window standing with her back to the room she didn't turn until he had nearly reached her then what she read in his face set all her doubts forever at rest his eyes rested on her humbly al- most reverently took in the trim per- fection of her tiny figure the lovely tilt of her small head the blue eyes that looked at him so wistfully a strange new beauty flamed in her face color returned in a flood to her pale cheeks this must be what it's like to be a sheriff's wife she thought and smiled as buck mindon gently put his one good arm around her in the next issue la golondrina a romantic tale by lupe loya a date with

reflected from polished mahogany and bright glassware he's ridin high wide an hand- some the tall young foreman of the rail fence said to sally everly when the old man gets started there ain't no stoppin him it's his way the girl answered shrugging her shoulders in boots overalls and faded flannel shirt she did not look like the daughter of the rich- est man in cade county but the rough- ness of her garb could not extinguish her beauty the cropped curly hair was red-gold the nose piquantly tip- tilted and the picture was completed by a full-lipped generous mouth and --ranch romances--first sept   ranch romances eyes a corn-flower blue darkening to violet in moments of abstraction there was a redeeming feminine inconsis- tency in her apparel too in the silver chain of a locket at her bared throat yes it's his way she repeated as she smiled frankly me i'm schooled to it if daddy didn't buck and fight leather once in a while i'd figure his health was failing true jack williams considered but there weren't so many girls who didn't feel bound to try and reform a man sally here was a wonder about that when her father felt like a bust--well he had one it was unusual for a girl even to enter blue bart's bodega the popular resort of this cowtown but sally everly went where she pleased if her father happened to be in the bodega when she wanted to speak to him in she went after him although when old henry everly rolled his tail she gen- erally let him run now however she stood poised in the doorway with her father's foreman and surveyed her rowdy sire appraisingly mr everly spending his money held down the end of the bar blue bart the purple-jawed proprietor was busily serving the cattle king and his dozen friends song was in the air an the skies are not cloudy all day chirped willie the wrangler an the deer and the cantaloup play chanted judge rumble and be- gan again in a booming basso home home on the range   that's what the tea kettle said agreed mr everly an another li'l drink won't do us any harm set em up in the other alley bart a flock o the same comin up mister everly grinned the proprietor at the same time slant- ing a fishy eye at sally who had ar- rived at her father's elbow any other dame he would have chased out ladies and liquor don't mix so well it was blue bart's solid conviction but old everly's daughter--well let her own pa handle her no i'm not a-comin home honey the stockman took the defensive i ain't boiled nor even simmerin jest havin a time with the boys oh that's all right with me sally humored the old reprobate only listen dad-- and she whispered in his ear well i reckon i can fend fer my- self maybe so but give it to me she was smiling but there was plenty of resolution in her eye and from the watch pocket of his trousers henry everly reluctantly drew a tiny slip of paper guardedly sally examined this there were scrawled numbers on it then she quickly snapped this scrap of paper into the locket on the end of her silver chain check dad she said affectionately patting his shoulder i'm hitting out for home now and in the morning i'll have a nice bromo- seltzer for your breakfast together under the stars the girl and the rail fence foreman rode on homeward they spoke little but each one knew what the other was thinking unlike a good many waddies jack williams had no false assurance as to his own abilities he was entirely fear- less he could handle men--and horses he was gay courageous popular very easy-going but that was the trouble if you'd only not be so nice--so --damned nice that's what sally had said to him exasperated only this afternoon she had learned that jack had been up since dawn combing the high pasture for a single measly mav- erick--a hand's work not a foreman's everybody puts things off on you how do you ever expect to run a spread of your own for who his knee touched hers as they were riding in you know jack aw honey he had grabbed her hand and she had let him hold it a moment eight spot  so now the ride back home was just another installment of this continued love story it took a man a hard smart sagacious man to run an enor- mous ranch like the rail fence sally right well knew it and hoped that jack was such a man times were particularly hard just now beef was way down and it looked as if there'd be mighty little profit for any of the cattlemen old everly himself was at the moment just a little better than solvent four whole sections of his best grazing land were heavily mortgaged and while he did have enough government bonds in his safe to clear up all indebtedness there would--if it came to a pinch-- be practically nothing left over for fu- ture operating expenses the everlys would pull through the old man for all his periodic toots had backbone but after henry everly was gone-- that in the starlight was what occu- pied both riders silent they rode hand in hand to the white bars of the gate mutely jack dismounted to let sally's sorrel mare through then walked up the long lane to the house at her stirrup he took the sorrel there as she slipped out of the saddle i'll try to make good sally i'll try to show yuh sally had to smile her hand was on his sleeve but she couldn't resist the dig let the nighthawk put up the horses it's his job well he's way at the end of the feed lot i could-- oh there you go again trying to do everybody's work sally ex- claimed and there was disappointment in her tone aw sally yuh don't hate me her hand slid up his sleeve and caught his chin firmly no jack she kissed him on the lips i love you darling dumbbell a rumbling sonata of snoring rolled out of the bunkhouse into that depth of darkness which precedes an autumn dawn it was indeed a sound of surprising variety and volume-- deep bass snores thin falsetto snores wheezes and whistles a couple of nervous milk cows in the neighboring corral stirred uneasily and switched their tails a leggy foal in the feed lot leaped from sleep and rushed wildly about until its mamma kicked it gently and told it to hush up and those same cowpokes laugh when they hear a burro soundin off was doubtless what the mare told its off- spring even the rather noisy homecoming of the boss henry everly did not dis- turb the boys slumbers incidentally unlike his foreman the boss did not bother about the nighthawk's comfort the wrangler had damn well better pick up his buckskin and stable it but just one minute later the roar which shook the prairie would almost have wakened the dead it was as se- vere as the explosion of a cannon jack williams was out of his bunk while the earth still shivered and trem- bled he did not pause even for his boots though instinctively his fingers snatched up his gunbelt and sixguns laid handy on the floor beside him he was at the door of the bunkhouse al- most before the others were stirring a wavering light in the ranch house suggested that the scene of the explo- sion might be yonder in stocking feet the young foreman ran headlong to- wards the main building then the light disappeared there came the scuffing and stamping of horses the low voices of men growling and swearing slap in yore hooks an git scarce someone shouted in the dark we'll have the whole nest of em swarmin indeed back at the bunkhouse the boys of the rail fence were rallying to follow their foreman jack let go one wild shot in the gen- eral direction of the ranch house he couldn't see a thing of course but from beyond the house where their horses had evidently been bunched came a spattering volley in answer  ranch romances bullets went zinging through the air or pecked into the dust it was jack williams impulse to re- turn that fire but in a crisis he pos- sessed a cool calm intelligence and he was aware that emptying his guns at an invisible target wouldn't be a whole lot of use moreover such an act might leave him with empty cylinders in his long sixes when he came close enough to fight effectively so both guns ready although silent he dashed on in the racket of galloping hoofs showed that the enemy were fleeing still in that blackness before dawn-- the night was clouded now -- you couldn't even glimpse the outline of the flying horses at the same time the clear command sounded in the deep voice of the one who was evidently the leader hold yore fire don't give em a mark jack did fire once then in the gen- eral direction from which the voice had issued but he got no salvo for an an- swer this time and so far as he could know his own shot had been useless put-a-poom put-a-poom across the prairie the thunder of the galloping horses faded further and further into the distance the intruders whoever they were had got away clean swiftly there came to jack's mind the whole understanding of what had hap- pened robbers had blown the safe in the ranch house living room anyone might have known that everly kept negotiable bonds there and the safe hopelessly old-fashioned could have been cracked by any yegg and sally the girl's bedroom was in a wing true but what if she had been aroused before the explosion and had gone to investigate her voice called him clothed in a dark green bathrobe she held a match high at the living room door beyond amid the debris of shattered plaster her father lay dead up from the bunkhouse the rest of the rail fence boys were already pounding they were in the living room by the time jack had lighted the oil lamp no need to take old everly's pulse or to listen to his heart sally white- faced wordless needed only to look at her father's face a bullet between the eyes is summary it was entirely evident that the old stockman entering the living room had come directly upon the thieves just as they were ready to blow the door of the safe one of them must have drilled him ruthlessly almost at the instant that the dynamite charge was fired everly's own sixgun dropped on the floor had not been fired its bore was unsullied by powder its chambers fully charged the girl in the first shock of the ca- tastrophe seemed congealed her mouth was drawn to a thin grim line her eyes were the hard brilliant blue of a bitter-cold winter sea when her lover tried clumsily to offer a word of comfort she held out one protesting hand and shook her head standing there with her back to the wall hands gripped in front of her she watched mutely while the men examined the evidences of the crime it was as if in her grief and anger she was in a hypnotic trance the door of the ancient safe had been neatly blown and hung only by the shred of a hinge that clearly in- dicated the work either of a profes- sional peterman--a city criminal expe- rienced in safe-cracking--or possibly of a skillful miner these were not just stray badmen of the range for the aver- age grub-liner knows nothing of the use of high explosives professional crooks if you ask me jack remarked squatting in front of the blown safe dragged their picket ropes a long ways commented riley jones there's none such varmints in sump flats not as we've heared of huh noddy bing noddy riley's partner noted for the briefness of his replies ad- mitted none i've heared of eight spot  well they've come now jack ex- pressed the obvious an gone said noddy but not jack pointed with a fin- ger with everything they were look- ing for he was indicating the face of a flat drawer the strong box set into the center of the wide-open safe that drawer operated by a small dial com- bination lock remained flush and un- opened they either didn't know that the ole man cached his government bonds there jack continued or else couldn't get at em he turned to sally you have the combination for all the grisly situation there was the sense of the lift of relief within him sally's body was safe her future financially provided for the girl nodded then she spoke for the first time as she turned back towards her bedroom i'm dressing we'll all be riding was all she said sally was the authority now si- lently the cowhands streamed out to catch up their broncos a milky line of dawn across the east heralded a sunless morning as they started out guns loose in their leath- ers loaded cartridge belts sagging on their thighs the rail fence men fanned out in a general northerly di- rection there was the best cover a gaunt wilderness country mountain- ous and arid save for the winding flow of the stream known as buffalo run this creek cutting often through deep canyons was impossible to follow con- tinuously but jack williams had the wise idea that the murderers would not stray too far from the stream's general course they and their mounts would often need water not the easiest thing to come by in this rugged country sally and her foreman held the cen- ter of the fan-shaped formation the others were lined out at about quarter- mile intervals in that rugged terrain few were in sight of each other at any one time but it had been agreed that a quick double shot should be the sig- nal to rally the girl on a pale gray mustang a handy chunk called ghost rode reck- lessly they were in a big loop of the river now working downhill towards a deep cut in the flat cold light of the morning they could distinguish fresh hoofprints now and then though the ground was mostly too stony to carry visible trace but lower down towards the edge of the stream a dis- tinct trail evidenced itself the way was narrowly hemmed in by tumbled boulders if the killers had planned a trap-- it was not a pistol shot which crashed against jack williams head but a jagged rock thrown deftly sally two rods ahead heard the thump of the missile and reined back she saw jack sway in his saddle and smash against a bulging rock--not thrown but balancing dizzily ghost was yanked around rearing his forefeet struck and scraped on the rocks as he tried desperately to turn in that narrow compass sally leaning far forward to preserve balance had her revolver cramped between thigh and saddle horn she could not jerk it loose even though a man's figure rose on a stony shelf almost directly above her so the noose of a lariat dropped rather than thrown clamped her elbows to her body and whipped her up out of the saddle she felt her ribs crushed in as if caught in a chain tourniquet then pain blanked out her consciousness nauseated and bruised sally woke to find herself helplessly baled up she could move her body from the waist up though the stabbing pain of bruised ribs tortured her if she stirred a muscle any other movement was effectively prevented though for her hands were securely lashed to her own belt buckle in front of her and her overalled legs had the feel of being bound together tight at the knees from as much as she could perceive she was able to gather only that she must be somewhere at the back of a cave the dim ruddiness of firelight  ranch romances shone upon the damp vaulting of the roof above there was from that gen- eral direction too the sound of the plashing flow of water she must be in a hide-out in buffalo run gritting her teeth against the pain it caused her sally writhed her body round till she could look in the direc- tion of the outer cave where there was the grumble of men's voices four figures faces masked to the eyes sat around a lantern they were intently playing black-jack their pris- oner saw and it was no penny-ante game either they were handling con- siderable sums of money bank notes as well as small stacks of silver half dollars and quarters hit me came the low-voiced re- iteration or else and again    enough    stand on this some- one said i'll pay eighteen that would be the dealer sink that damned mutilated eight spot another man snarled i'll be damned if i'll play with marked cards wonder he'd have to cut up the only deck o cards we got jest like a sneakin-- shut yore damn fool face was the sharp interruption else it'll be slapped shut for yuh that was the dealer a quick glance over his shoulder had glimpsed the reflection of the lamplight in the supposedly uncon- scious captive's eyeballs so yo're awake sister the dealer laid down his deck of cards rose and came over to where sally crouched he was a big bulky man his eyes startlingly pale through the slits in his mask treated yuh sort o rough hey too bad but we had to kid yuh was getting a mite too close to home no hard feel- in's we're just rough big-hearted fellers what--what happened to jack williams that was her immediate concern the man i was riding with what's he to yuh--lover i love him yes so  mused the big man well now if i tell yuh-- there was a sharp interruption aw can the chatter an tell her to come across with the combination to open the strong box a stoop-shoul- dered man with long arms which dan- gled ape-like had risen and was hold- ing the lamp high so that there was more light in the inner cave he like the others was masked with black calico not a makeshift scarf wound to the eyes but a stitched hand-made af- fair to the girl's quick intelligence this was proof that these were not in- deed mere casual criminals but thieves of careful intent check that's right said the first man we got yuh here sister we aim to keep yuh awhile say until yuh tell the combination to that locked box in yore safe the locket against her flesh seemed suddenly hot if they should guess what was in that but she managed to control her voice to answer flatly i don't know she's lyin o course she savvies broke in a third member of the gang masked uniformly with the others she led her ole man around by the nose tough old wampus though he was he'd sure have told her we got ways of makin yuh talk sweetness murmured the leader malevolently we wouldn't like to hurt a nice girl but-- frightened as she was sally used her brain it suddenly occurred to her that here was a way to find out the truth about jack williams i tell you i don't know so much was the truth for she had not memorized the num- bers for all that they were there plain to read in the locket against her skin but now the chance by a misleading statement to learn of her lover prompted her to say jack williams had the slip with the numbers on it in his shirt pocket the long-armed rogue exploded an we let him get away cathcart too late a savage elbow jolted him eight spot  in the midriff we didn't search his corpse yuh mean corrected the leader but the correction came too late if jack williams had been killed they would certainly have stripped him in search of cash and valuables and most of all for a possible clue to the strong box's combination no sally's lover was alive free and so would surely come looking for her likely before dark fell again meantime-- for all her physical shrinking the calm strength of her will allowed her to maintain a brave front the four ruffians grumbled and growled ar- gued hesitated but in the end they did nothing they could not be sure that she really did know the combina- tion of the lock to the strong box however lawless and brutal they still had the westerners traditional loath- ing of any act of violence towards a woman the hours drew along while they half heartedly gambled with their tat- tered and mutilated playing cards it was reasonable to suppose that with the return of night they would attempt an escape from a neighborhood which must by now be fairly swarming with vengeful searchers then sore as was her body and un- comfortable her position sally must have slept for she woke to hear an entirely new voice--a very heavy bass disguised she was quite sure so some- one else had come to the cave to join her four captors not a friend though by midnight i'll meet yuh i know the way those particular words were distinct meanwhile get it off her an bring it to me at-- the voice went trailing away as the speaker un- seen in the outer cave moved off towards the den's opening almost instantly though the man cathcart the one sally had thought of as the leader entered the inner cave carrying a patent flash this he coolly pocketed and then in the dark with- out a word seized the girl's chin in his left hand jerked her head back sav- agely and with a clawing right hand tore the locket from its chain using his flash for an instant he clicked the locket's lid open to dis- cover the scrawled scrap of paper here all right he called to the men a man with a fractured skull may have his lucid moments but whatever his determination no exer- cise of will can keep him straddling a horse for long jack williams with bloodied head had been powerless to control his panicked bronc but he had been borne away clear out of the narrow cut and into open grazing land before he finally toppled there he was quickly discovered and carried back to the bunkhouse long hours he lay in a daze sump flats had turned out to a man to try to run down the murderers of the old rail fence owner henry everly had been well liked moreover the wounding of his foreman and the ab- duction of the girl had set the whole county seething with anger trigger- fingers itched and a hundred riders went fanning out from the ranch spurring into the hides of as many con- trary cayuses judge rumble the saloonkeeper blue bart titus the gentlemanly gambler sheriff arp and banker bur- cheil had all assembled to pursue the hunt they stopped for a word with the injured foreman who lay con- scious only now and then under the ministrations of doc wren the local physician veterinarian and coroner sheriff arp no modern sleuth had been able to deduce little as to the iden- tity of the criminals sump flats had been enjoying--or suffering--a mild homestead boom and many a saddle- bum moocher and tinhorn sashayed through the town this dirty job would have been the work of strang- ers but which ones nor was the sheriff particularly adept in his pursuit of clues dozens of inquisitive amateur investigators  ranch romances went rambling about through the ranch house inspecting the shattered safe viewing the spot where everly fell messing up whatever minute items of evidence there possibly might have been till after dark the posses combed empty draws but before nine o'clock in the evening the first enthusiasm of the pursuit bogged down most of the amateur hunters hungry and weary came trailing in on tired horses to the bunkhouse of the rail fence the sheriff for the tenth time was trying to draw some definite details from the wounded and dizzied foreman while the judge blue bart titus and half a dozen others fidgeted around jack's bunk the hands of the bunkhouse clock stood exactly at right angles to indi- cate nine o'clock when the distant fus- illade opened everyone but the old doctor was im- mediately out and off again it was a welcome thrill for most of them after so many hours of futile casting about but old doc wren surgeon through indian wars sitting coroner in the wake of many a cowtown fracas was content to stay at his post and watch his patient's temperature a mean thing a fractured skull may not amount to anything or may knock a man out as suddenly as a puff of breath snuffs out a candle afar off sounded gunfire in a con- tinual tut-tut-tut-tut punctuated now and then by the flatter distinctive note of a long rifle it was a veritable can- nonade there could be little doubt that over the buttes and barrancas the boys were harrying the killer gang no moon but a brilliant starlight would give illumination enough for the battle as doc wren perceived staring out of the bunkhouse window but at that he cynically observed thar'll be more of our own boys nicked than any of the others whereupon he moved over to the stove to sterilize some more knives and probes jack from the bed spoke lucidly for the first time good business for yuh tonight doc he said then remem- bering the situation doc docwhere's sally the physician shook his head as he shot an appraising glance at his pa- tient the flush had seeped from jack's face he was if anything too pale now the doctor left his scalpels to boil and went over to take jack's pulse slow yeah--but steady sally sally i remember--she was ridin just ahead o me when-- when somebody dropped a whole hunk o hillside right crack on yore conk agreed wren inelegantly but accurately but don't yuh git all of a whew about sally everly men huh she can handle em like a good workin hand handles a bunch o dogies but what happened to her is she out in that gunfire echoed now more brokenly and what sporadic shots still detonated seemed actually to be approaching now and then too down wind drifted the shrill yip-e-e-e the cowboy shout of triumph a distant vague rever- beration told that a cavalcade was re- turning sounds like they'd corralled the lot mused doc wren that sheriff fer all he's thicker than a stout cedar post ain't one to drop his hand till he's played it to the limit sure enough here they come and he stared through the window bringin home the bacon with sally tut tut is that nice the tough old codger jollied dead hawgs make bacon he supplemented cynically there was no necessity to explain this very gruesome jest several of the sump flats boys were riding double with led horse which carried things which were not--well--riders one rail fence hand and one deputy sheriff had been sadly brought home to die but the bodies of the four strang- ers which were carried in to be laid on the bunkhouse floor were far past doc eight spot  wren's ministrations in the case of these four he could serve only as coroner the story of their capture and anni- hilation was briefly told north of buffalo run riley jones and bing noddy had spied hailed and chal- lenged them in the running fight which had ensued as reinforcements swept up the four bandits had been mown down but not a one of them had spoken before he died there was yet no clue to sally's fate with a rising fever jack williams tried to sit up demanding news of the girl he loved i'll give yuh a shot of the needle doc wren threatened i told yuh that girl could fend for herself dizzily jack heaved himself up from his bunk grab im he'll kill himself one of the boys exclaimed i'm goin--goin--to find her jack insisted hombre yo're goin to sleep was the physician's reply prompt in an emergency doc wren drove his hypodermic needle hard into jack's shoulder while several cow- hands held the man and forced him back onto the blankets quickly be- cause of his feeble condition the nar- cotic took effect he lay presently in merciful unconsciousness we will now gents the doctor re- marked imperturbable as ever per- ceed to view the remains you bart he spoke to the saloonkeeper turn out their pockets and you brother titus bein a hand at figgers make a list o what yuh find on ary corpse letterin em a b c an d sheriff arp who had been back and forth to the ranch house restlessly sud- denly appeared in the door they did get those gov'ment bonds was his sudden announcement somebody indeed had purloined the bonds somehow the drawer in the safe which served as strong box and which had been locked tight at the dis- covery of the murder the night before was now slightly open--and empty it had not been jimmied or blown loose someone had got hold of the dial com- bination and placidly helped himself one o these fellers could've sneaked back mebbe riley jones suggested pointing to the grim rank of corpses he might've got the com- bination-- he broke off to look ner- vously at the heavily slumbering fore- man then went on--from--from sally the rat cursed a dozen turn em inside out bart croaked the sheriff one of em'll have the papers on him he prob'ly thought he'd made a good haul bing noddy suggested hard to cash where he's at blue bart and titus rapidly went over the bodies there was a considerable sum of loose cash several hundred dollars in bank notes and silver and gold pieces but on none of the thieves was there any trace of a negotiable government bond for the rest there was only the useless collection of junk which men are accustomed to carry in their pockets knives a rabbit's foot a cou- ple of horsehair fobs various scraps of paper tobacco sacks sulphur matches girls pictures a sentimental piece of poetry only a single postcard taken from the body of the biggest bandit offered anything which might be even remotely considered to promise any lead the postcard read on the address side mr chris cathcart oklahoma city okla the message on the other side was printed out an ordinary enough message in any cattle country take it easy there are no box cars ready for movement to el paso now road not open yet get beef here before a week from next saturday and there won't be no great hurry make deal by barter or trade of two for one innocent looking as the card was the sheriff and the rest stared at this thing till they were dizzy anybody might've sent it an it  ranch romances might mean anythin or nothin the baffled officer of the law said shaking his head sadly to run down a crowd of crooks and wipe them out and then to discover that the master criminal had whisked away clean--a swell dish but if i kin only lay hands on any friend o this here cathcart's sheriff arp went on any live friend that is-- jack where is he came a choked cry at the doorway breathless covered with dust bare arms scarred and blistered from the rawhide which had bound her and which she had had to burn loose in or- der to free herself sally everly stum- bled into the bunkhouse her eyes were blazing but beautiful for all that they were deep-sunk behind cheek bones smeared with soot and there was clotted blood on her throat where the chain of the locket had been wrenched asunder but careless of all comment she dropped on her knees by the semi-con- scious sufferer pillowing his head against her breast jack jack dear- est don't take on miss sally the doc- tor told her he's jest enjoyin sweet slumber he'll come to in his own good time then we'll carry him up to the house the girl ordered peremptorily lift him some of you boys several jumped to obey her wal bing noddy commented as they carried the sleeping man out i aim to heir his bunk till he comes back agreed riley bing noddy made a good guess i low he ain't a-comin back to the bunk- house hombre removal to the ranch house had how- ever roused jack williams from his pleasant torpor for a minute or two it was idle blissfulness to rest his throbbing head against the shoulder of the girl he loved then dawning recog- nition of her own injuries startled him into full consciousness honey he gasped did they maul yuh rest easy darling she told him and proceeded quietly to recount the details of her capture--the intermin- able game of cards the entrance of the fifth man the violent theft of the locket which obviously had led to the disappearance of her government bonds we'll be dirt-poor now jack they'll foreclose on the whole rail fence we'll have to begin all over dear in a cabin on buffalo run with three hens and a burro her lever grinned well that's all right with me but they ain't outdrawn us yet let me think over what yuh told me sally for all her warm-hearted emo- tional impetuousness had a very clear head on her shapely shoulders she had neglected no incident of her long day of imprisonment in the cave in- cluding the detail of the peculiarly mutilated playing card she had been able to identify the dead men accu- rately enough from the brief glance she'd had of them in the bunkhouse sheriff arp accompanying her to the ranch house had displayed the small scrap of evidence he had garnered the ambiguous postcard she told jack about that too that eight spot--now that's curi- ous jack now reflected going over her story in his mind yuh don't know what suit it was guess it don't matter all eight spots have their spots set on em alike ai-e-e-e he jerked himself upright and thought his whole scalp was likely to burn off tenderly sally eased him back against the pillows easy cowboy what is it just an idea go ask sheriff arp to come up here he muttered when he was able to control the throbbing of his head enough to permit himself to think lucidly ask him on the quiet honey without the others knowin hatched something jack mebbe not but got a hen on an tip him to bring that postcard he got off the guy that was called cathcart no sooner had the girl gone out into eight spot  the darkness than the wounded man be- haved like a very undisciplined invalid brutal as the pain in his head was he slipped out of the bed whisked out to the living room of the ranch and there possessed himself of two articles--a deck of cards and the late henry ev- erly's revolver battling the blinding dizziness which seemed to club at his brain he got back into his bed without being observed tucked the revolver under the bed- clothes by his hip and then performed a peculiar operation upon the first eight spot of cards which came to his hand-- it happened to be an eight of clubs he carefully poked out all the black spots leaving a white oblong of pasteboard with eight symmetrically arranged punctures in it sally came back with the sheriff honey jack told her us men'd now admire to stage a stag party would yuh be good an kind enough to round up the judge blue bart titus an the doc those four'll be sufficient send em in to me an wait awhile out- side if sally everly resented this brusque taking over of her authority she did not at least evidence it or--just maybe--she reminded herself that she was no longer the boss here with the loss of the bonds the rail fence was no longer hers it would be corralled by the bankers gracefuly enough therefore she took orders from her foreman silent evidently uneasy the four men who had thus been summoned came trooping into the ranch house bed- room sheriff arp stood just by the door so that all four had to pass him and stand a little in front of him as they faced the man in the bed i have here said jack williams producing the postcard the sheriff had loaned him a right interestin docu- ment we've all of us used stencils-- smack im sheriff the keeper of the bodega blue bart had suddenly gone for his sixgun so swift had been the move that the slow-witted sheriff had not been pre- pared only the very mercy of the extreme speed of bart's draw which made aim- ing difficult sent the first bullet sogging into the wall over the bed's head-board jack's gun spoke then and blue bart went down the neat packet of bonds was in the dead man's inner pocket the room had been tidied up by the removal of the remains the wounded man and his nurse were alone in the lamplight sally was still eying that betraying postcard with the punctured eight of clubs superimposed upon it as in a stencil the eight damning words stood out through the soles in the playing card easy box to open here saturday hurry bart so that was the reason for the muti- lated eight spot it was a sort of secret decoding device which enabled the men to read the cryptic messages sent them by their chief the invalid grinning observed this'd sure make a funny-soundin story you doin all the fightin takin all the risks gettin away from those rogues and me just lyin here dreamin and finding me the money her fingers caressed his hot forehead sho i had to find yuh yore money sweet but this yarn sure got saddled backward what was the old song dear she couldn't help teasing him tenderly for men must work and women must weep that poet sure pulled a boner it went hind end to this time sally said of course i do like to be called brave but darling you are smarter no his cheek touched hers it's only the result of a wicked an wasteful youth honey i just know more about playin cards the valley of dispute by  eric howard they called him rolling stone and certainly he had gathered no moss but that was before he came to clear creek valley and laid eyes on anne who charmed him with her radiant smile riding down from the pine meadows where he had camped last night jerry stone sud- denly pulled up his roan horse and stared down into the small green valley a rough map that had been drawn for him told him that this was the disputed territory he reached into his saddle bag and took out a pair of high-powered field glasses with them to aid his natur- ally far-sighted eyes he could see the thin trickle of sparkling water that flowed through the center of the little valley its source was the spring that was the particular object of con- tention between the c cross owner and the circle four outfit but it wasn't the valley itself beau- tiful as it was that had attracted his attention he had seen the movement of animals down there in and out of the aspens that fringed the green meadow cattle no doubt then he realized that they were horses and that each horse bore a rider he was too far away to make out their brands but he judged that they were circle four riders he frowned remembering that the big outfit had agreed to keep the peace and to stay away from the disputed valley until he had completed his survey that was the injunction of the court he rode on down the trail part of the time the valley was obscured by  the valley of dispute  trees and outcropping rocks but whenever he could see it jerry swung his field glasses to his eyes and sur- veyed the scene he saw about fifteen horsemen on one side of the thin stream they seemed to be confront- ing someone lined up on the opposite side of the valley but who it was jerry could not see he rode faster hoping to reach a place of vantage before his presence was discovered a shot rang out and he saw a puff of smoke from the gun held by one of the riders an answer- ing shot came from the other side and then many guns spoke jerry spurred his horse whirled off the dim trail and started down the steep slope he came out on a level expanse halfway down the hill and halted again the horsemen he had seen were riding away those who had answered their attack let them go he continued down into the valley his field glasses were replaced and his hand was near his holstered gun in his saddle boot he carried a rifle stop or i'll shoot came a sharp command jerry had emerged from a thicket of aspens in spite of his cautious advance he had been seen he stopped and slowly lifted his hands mean- while looking for the owner of the voice a slim figure came out from the brush howdy said jerry easily i rode down when i heard ail the shootin looks like you run off all them hombres i ain't one of em if that's what you thought he observed that the hand which held a gun leveled at him wavered he saw too that the hand was quite small lordy you're a girl he exclaimed and swung down from his saddle don't come near the girl cried don't jerry obediently stood beside his horse his hands raised again shucks ma'am you don't have to be afraid of me i'm jerry stone sur- veyor an deputy sheriff appointed by the court to run a survey through here an find out who owns this spring an valley i reckon you must be miss custer of the c cross an them fellers that jest left here was from the circle four right the girl nodded and allowed her gun to fall at her side jerry grinned and lowered his hands you're really jerry stone appoint- ed by the court she asked yes ma'am i sure am buck dawson--he's the circle four superintendent--said you'd never get here he said he'd see that you were stopped and turned back h'm well it looks like mr daw- son kind o miscalculated here i am jerry's gray eyes twinkled and a faint smile hovered on the lips of the girl then jerry heard a groan of pain and the girl turned swiftly and took two steps into the brush jerry followed there on the ground lay a gray-haired man his hat had fallen at his side and there was a dark stain of blood on his flannel shirt dad cried anne custer here's jerry stone the surveyor he's come at last the old man on the ground gritted his teeth and looked up at jerry them fellers attack you two jerry asked jest you two lord i thought there was a whole army of you from the way they was shootin he knelt beside jim custer and opened his shirt examining the wound we been expectin you custer said through tight lips we figgered they'd obey the court's injunction till you settled things but they won't i'm all right anne girl get my horse we'll ride for home on that ride to the c cross ranch house with anne on one side of her father and jerry on the other the young man heard their version of the boundary dispute the spring and half of the green valley had always been considered a part of the c cross spread until the circle four ranch  ranch romances was bought by a syndicate and buck dawson placed in charge of it dawson with big plans for the de- velopment of the ranch had soon claimed the whole valley and all the water of the spring jim custer had taken the dispute into court with the result a survey had been ordered made and both parties had been en- joined to avoid conflict dawson however had failed to live up to his agreement one of custer's riders had seen a suspicious fire down in the valley and upon investigating had found two c cross calves bearing the circle four brand it's easy to change c cross into circle four anne pointed out and that's what he's been doing dad and i rode out this morning and we met those men there dawson was with them dad reminded them that the court had ordered them to stay away from the stream dawson laughed and some pretty hot words followed then one of them began shooting i saw that jerry nodded but i wasn't close enough to see any of em this dawson must be pretty bad huh scum ejaculated jim custer scum that's what he is he'll stop at nothin to get what he wants he's told us what he'll do to you we thought mebbe you'd been scared out already not yet jerry grinned whimsi- cally i haven't seen dawson yet of course so i'm not scared out you can't tell--i may be when i meet up with him he's scared out plenty grunted custer but anne was looking steadily at jerry as though testing his quality and strength she saw a mouth and chin firm and resolute in spite of his slow smile and she recognized that beneath his easy good humor there was something of steel or of stone i guess he won't scare you out she nodded satisfied at the ranch after jim custer had been made comfortable and a rider had been dispatched to cabazon for a doctor jerry stone sat on the porch steps and watched the slim quick- moving figure of anne as she went about directing the work of the men he admired her competence almost as much as he admired that direct level glance out of her blue eyes and the rose flush on her tanned cheeks she came and sat down beside him as he had hoped she would this feller dawson said jerry voicing the thoughts that had been running through his mind it seems like he was takin a long chance at- tackin you he didn't know i was there at first anne told him he thought he'd got dad alone when he saw me he was surprised he doesn't want any witnesses to what he does and then i think he saw you riding down and that's what made them leave maybe he didn't know who you were but you came just in time glad of that jerry nodded al- though i wouldn't a been much use against that mob i'll start out in the mornin an look the situation over then the next day mebbe your father will lend me one of his hands an i can get to work dawson will try to make trouble for you one way or another i reckon he might but i been appointed to run a line through that valley an i guess i have to do it there was something very pleasant about the c cross outfit to jerry stone homeless wanderer of the range sitting at the table with anne and later before the great fireplace in the living room he began to reflect upon the wisdom of settling down they had called him rolling stone down on the border and he had cer- tainly gathered no moss of experi- ence he had had a plenty he had known danger and he had followed the bright trail of adventure that was what he was doing now he thought stroking his chin the valley of dispute  none of the regular deputies had wanted this job he remembered that they had all protested that they weren't surveyors the sheriff had seized upon jerry and had eagerly appointed him to carry out the court's order he grinned to himself the sheriff had known what he was send- ing him into and he hadn't given him so much as a hint of dawson's caliber but he was glad he had come the doctor from cabazon arrived interrupting the friendly conversation jerry and anne were having and with the doctor came a young man who was introduced as stanley vail jerry took an immediate dislike to him for no other reason than the cordiality with which anne welcomed him stan vail was a laughing happy curly-haired cowboy he had a way with him as he caught anne's hands and held them looking down at her affectionately i heard your dad had been shot he said so i rode right out with the doctor thanks stan how is he honey anne didn't try to take her hands out of his and she didn't object to the word of endearment jerry stone busying himself with the rolling of a cigarette felt the blood rise in his cheeks he rebuked himself sternly and caustically just because anne had been pleasant and friendly to him a stranger didn't mean that he had any right to object to her friendliness toward others no doubt she loved this big good-looking stan vail was that any business of his jerry stone's it wasn't but for all that he felt a vague resentment when anne had followed the doctor into her father's room vail sat down before the fire and spread his hands to the blaze so you're goin to survey clear creek valley he asked jerry had dealt with men of all types in his wanderings he had learned to weigh not only their words but their manner of speech and so he caught an overtone of mockery of derision in stan vail's question that's what i was sent here for he answered obliquely an it looked easy enough they didn't tell me about dawson that was a bid for vail to express his opinion he merely laughed didn't they tell you what dawson did to another surveyor that came here asked vail after a moment jerry shook his head and vail laughed again jerry wondered why vail friendly to the custers probably in love with anne had not allied himself with them in their fight with dawson he himself had already taken their side had decided that they were in the right otherwise dawson wouldn't have attacked them fifteen men against a man and a girl dawson's a big man over this way vail volunteered the county seat an the sheriff are too far away to bother him he does what he likes yeah but in this boundary dis- pute how come he's been allowed to do what he likes one of his men shot jim custer today how come the men of this section stand for that vail shrugged nobody big enough to buck him he said with an apprais- ing glance at jerry the s bar o-- that's where i work--has kept him off our range so far but the boss ain't lookin for trouble so you jest let him shoot up any- body he don't like asked jerry mildly you let him try to kill jim custer an mebbe injure miss anne me demanded vail angrily i-- then he smiled again i reckon you won't do anything once dawson gets to you mebbe jerry granted when anne and the doctor came out of custer's room reporting that he was resting easily and not badly hurt jerry got up and said good night he went to the room anne had shown him earlier and lay awake for  ranch romances hours pondering on the situation vail he was sure had tried to im- press him with the impossibility of carrying out his task there was no- body big enough to buck dawson jerry grunted in disgust he would suspend judgment until he had met dawson but from what he knew of him he was an imitation badman run- ning loose on the range tomorrow he'd make a preliminary inspection of the spring and the val- ley perhaps he'd meet dawson hours after he had gone to his room long after the doctor had left jerry saw stan vail ride away he scowled early the next morning after a hasty breakfast in the kitchen jerry saddled his roan and rode off toward clear creek valley after reaching the spring high above the valley he followed the stream down to the point where its waters poured into a blue lake which was indispu- tably on c cross land dawson in claiming the spring and the valley intended to impound the water by building an earth dam and creating an artificial lake from which he could irrigate the circle four bottom lands there was much at stake nothing was so valuable as water on this range and the possession of the spring meant everything to the c cross the circle four a bigger spread had plenty of water on other parts of its land as jerry had half expected a rider approached him from the circle four side of the valley pretending that he had not seen him jerry rode on slowly hey you what you doin here jerry halted and turned waiting for the other to ride close as the man advanced he was sure that it was dawson and as he looked at the man's heavy pockmarked face a flicker of surprise passed over his own dawson was wearing the usual range garb but as jerry looked at him he saw him in different clothes he saw him mounted on a chestnut arabian with a silver-studded saddle and ornamented bridle wearing tight mexican trousers a silk shirt and a short jacket with his oily black hair topped by a flat-crowned sombrero he saw him riding into the border town of los alamos at the head of a band of men again he listened to the warning cries of the people as they took refuge behind the barred doors of their houses he heard again the name which struck terror into their hearts the name was not daw- son what you doin here the rider demanded again jerry smiled the advantage was his decidedly he knew dawson yet dawson had never seen him before i reckon it's none of your busi- ness jerry drawled but i don't mind tellin you he explained who he was watching dawson closely what would have been an ingratiating smile in another man crossed dawson's face and he thrust out his hand with an exclama- tion of pleasure been expectin you he boomed we sure want this dispute cleared up why didn't you come right along to the circle four we can make you comfortable an help you while you're on this job thanks nodded jerry i met up with custer an his daughter an i'm stoppin there huh laughed dawson well we ain't got any pretty girls like her over our way don't blame you he leered at jerry and laughed again but we'll be glad to help you out jest come along an let me show you where this line oughta be the way we see it jerry followed him and listened to his explanations they didn't ring true but he made no comment he was waiting for some definite pro- posal from dawson it came later as a result of something jerry said the valley of dispute  dawson had asked if he were a regu- lar deputy and he replied that he had taken the job because he was broke say dawson caught him up you won't get much out of this--jest wages no use wastin a lot o time on it custer's had the use of this water quite a spell but it's circle four property all right that's plain enough he waited a moment then hurried on s'pose you make a quick job of it an go back an report the line runs here he gestured with a sweep of his arm huh i could make it worth five hundred mebbe jerry laughed you tryin to bribe me dawson no he shook his head i was taught always to do my duty i got to run a survey through here all right an proper shucks said dawson with that same ingratiating smile of course you do i was jest jokin forget it these days most men can be bought --i was tryin you out now i can see you're square an goin to do what's right i reckon you won't let anne custer's smiles bribe you huh i'm here to do this job said jerry sternly they tell me another sur- veyor was here did you bribe him-- or what lordy no boomed dawson that feller was scared of his shadow somebody filled him full o hot air told him i was plumb ornery an he jest quit i'm glad to see you on the job cause we want this matter set- tled shortly afterwards dawson left him with another handshake and hearty words jerry watched him smiling slightly he had deliberately avoided all mention or the scene he had wit- nessed the day before he had allowed dawson to think he was taken in by his overly cordial manner but he knew that failing to bribe him sus- picious of him because he was staying at the c cross and evidently not wishing to try to scare him off daw- son would resort to other methods when the time came late that day he rode back to the c cross and went in to see jim cus- ter the old rancher was sitting up staring somberly out of the window when jerry entered he turned with a smile and gestured to another chair they discussed the boundary line for some time but jerry made no mention of dawson's attempt to bribe him as he got up to leave the room jim custer put out his hand i took a likin to you young fel- ler he said an i want to tell you something you seem like an easy- goin square-shootin man the sheriff run you in on this job prob'ly with- out tellin you what you'd be up against i'll tell you dawson's bound an set to beat me legal or illegal i figger we can't win even if the court says we're right i wouldn't care so much only this outfit's all i've got --for anne if you report that we're right dawson won't let you out o here he'll get you what the sheriff oughta do is to send a lot of men here on this job not one one man hasn't got a chance i'm tellin you this cause i don't want to see you get hurt you'd better go back an tell the sheriff you can't do it alone an then he'll send somebody that can do it--the way dawson wants it done huh jim custer nodded i reckon jerry shook his head i'll stay till it's done i met up with dawson to- day seems right friendly i won't have any trouble i guess if i can borrow one of your boys tomorrow i'll start in don't let dawson fool you son if he finds out you're square if he knows you're goin to report in our favor--the way you'll have to bein square--he won't let you make that report thanks for tellin me but i'll have to risk it i guess meeting anne in the hall as he left the room jerry was puzzled by her impersonal unfriendly nod she passed --ranch romances--first sept  ranch romances him quickly going into her father's room and closed the door jerry stared the friendliness of the day before had vanished as he went out on the porch jerry saw stan vail riding down the lane toward the road to cabazon he nod- ded to himself vail had been talking to anne about him he lounged against a porch pillar staring across at the rolling hills when this job was done and he had made his report he'd be riding again into new country no use staying in one place but he wouldn't have minded staying at the c cross presently anne called to him say- ing dad would like to see you a moment when he went back into the room the rancher scrutinized him for a long moment then he spoke his friendly paternal attitude of a few minutes before seemed to have vanished too i believe in sayin what's on my mind we been told stone that daw- son is boastin he's bought you up when i advised you to leave this job undone my warnin didn't seem to worry you now dawson claims he's bribed you did you meet him today yeah did he bribe you custer leaned forward jerry looked from him to the girl i reckon you'll have to find that out from the messenger boy that brought you this here news he drawled if dawson did bribe me i wouldn't be tellin if he didn't an says he did it wouldn't do me much good to talk i'll leave the talkin to him an mister vail he turned toward the door i wouldn't a listened to it said jim custer half apologetically if you hadn't acted so plumb careless about buckin dawson jerry grinned dawson's a kind of bogey man around here he remarked vail was tellin me how bad he is an you too looks like nobody wants me to survey that valley how do i know but what dawson's bribed vail we've known stan vail a long time said jim custer an you don't know me at all jerry smiled well all i'm askin of you is the help of one man he left them passing anne with an amused glance and he knew that they would discuss him after he had gone later at the table and in the big living room they were hospitable enough but the friendly warmth of the day before had disappeared they weren't sure of him didn't trust him well it couldn't be helped he went to his room early after custer had told him that slim purdue would help him the next day purdue was one of the oldest men on the ranch and un- questionably loyal to custer jerry and slim left the ranch early and had been at work for several hours when slim came running down to where jerry stood they're comin he cried daw- son an some of his gang we better duck out o here let em come said jerry slim stared at him open-mouthed say he exclaimed when dawson sees where you're runnin this line he'll go loco i don't aim to get shot up then jump your horse an high-tail it for the ranch advised jerry heck i can't leave you here mut- tered slim the boss'd give me hell if i did come on jerry waved his hand and went back to his instrument say exploded slim you don't know this dawson jerry grinned that's where you're wrong slim i sure do know him not knowing what to make of that slim stared at jerry he scratched his chin meanwhile glancing up toward the bluff where he had seen dawson and his riders you're runnin this line jest where jim custer claims it oughta be he the valley of dispute  muttered which means dawson'll be out for your scalp if he bought you off how come you ain't doin what he wanted done slim was asking the question of himself having been told by jim cus- ter to keep a close watch on jerry if the surveyor-deputy heard it he gave no sign he was busily at work when dawson followed by three men rode into the valley as before dawson greeted him cor- dially but jerry saw that his com- panions were hard-faced scowling and heavily armed in reply to dawson's questions he indicated where the boundary line would run dawson uttered an exclamation of surprise and asked more questions jerry re- plied crisply so you're sidin with custer dawson demanded his ingratiating manner suddenly leaving him him an his gal fixed you huh he took a step toward jerry his right hand stiff above his gun out of the corner of his eye jerry saw his three companions circle in some- where behind him if he hadn't fled was slim when jerry stone replied to daw- son he looked him in the eye he was smiling i'm runnin the line where it be- longs it ain't a question of sidin with anybody custer jest happens to be right you tried to bribe me he didn't but that's beside the point here's the line and here she goes he lowered his voice and added so that only dawson could hear si señor gringo dawes if dawson had intended to draw his gun those few softly spoken words astonished and surprised him it re- quired a full moment for them to sink into his mind and in that moment he saw a flashing series of pictures from his own past jerry before had seen those pic- tures gringo dawes the terror of border towns riding his chestnut arabian robbing and killing at the head of his band of assorted ruffians gringo dawes in fights with sheriffs and rangers riding rough-shod over the officers of the law and then-- what jerry didn't know--gringo dawes captured arrested wounded jailed escaping only by chance and the loyalty of one of his men now as buck dawson he was the boss of the circle four but unable to run straight playing his old game of taking what he wanted by force jerry's words brought to him the realization that he was known jerry like the others he had fought and killed was an officer of the law expres- sions of fear anger and cunning crossed his heavy dark face his stiff- fingered hand moved downward but jerry watching him closely stepped quickly forward his gun flash- ing in his hand the barrel of it sink- ing into dawson's paunch with his left hand he snatched dawson's gun from its holster flung it aside as the other's hand closed on his wrist over dawson's shoulder jerry saw the three circle four men dismount- ing edging forward stay where you are he command- ed or i'll finish dawson you're wanted gringo i'm arrestin you they stood quite still dawson clutching jerry's wrist jerry's gun against his body the other men had halted where slim was jerry didn't know circle round dawson called to his men get in back of him an grab him you do laughed jerry an i'll kill this hombre the reward notices say dead or alive gringo--you oughta know that dawson did not lack courage with a savage growl of rage he jerked at jerry's arm exerting the full strength of his heavy body and swung aside his left arm sweeping down to knock the gun from jerry's hand the gun roared and the bullet grazed dawson's side as he swung as jerry was off balance and a little apart from daw-  ranch romances son one of the circle four men fired hot lead tore through jerry's shoul- der in self-protection he closed with dawson attacking savagely bearing him to the ground dawson yelled to his comrades and they ran toward the fighting men jerry heard the roar of sixguns and then with a feeling of relief slim purdue's steady voice stand back you jaspers said slim amid the deafening roar as he fought with dawson jerry heard the crack of a rifle then he saw that dawson had recovered his own gun and was bringing it down toward his head he swung aside wrenching his wounded shoulder and with a pain- stiffened finger pulled the trigger of his forty-four dawson's gun crashed against his skull and a great weight descended upon him that was all jerry knew until he felt gentle arms encircling his neck and felt hot tears upon his cheek then he heard slim purdue's voice i reckon he's comin to he sure finished dawson or dawes or what- ever his name was an them others-- say when you opened up with the rifle they must a thought a hull army had dropped down on em only you shouldn't a come here ma'am--it was plumb crazy jerry heard a choked sob and softly spoken words i came to spy on him thinking he had sold out to dawson i didn't trust him i might have known--i did know that he was honest and square but i let stan vail-- vail said slim disgustedly you can't believe him on a stack of bibles jerry wanted to tell anne not to cry but it was some time before his brain cleared and he could sit up he found anne beside him and he patted her arm she said something about forgive- ness and he smiled at her he saw her own radiant smile and he sighed her tear-wet cheek was against his and she kissed him heck observed slim we oughta be ridin home slim rode on ahead and reported to jim custer the details of what had hap- pened yeah he concluded an you're goin to get a son-in-law out of this deal not stan vail slim waved his hand disdainfully him lord no this surveyor- deputy they plumb forgot i was with em billin an cooin like they'd discovered a new world and they had phantom gunman by  john johnson there was only one person who could bring law to sterling county and they said he was dead yet someone some strange illusive gunman entered the ranks of justice to wreak vengeance for the death of an honest man any mail for me asked the girl nothin miss lee you're sure there's noth- ing from jim cranford the corrupt postmaster of sterling could not meet grace lee's wide vio- let eyes nothin ma'am he lied she sighed and went away a shad- ow over her fine-featured lovely face the postmaster stuck a postcard in his pocket and hurried over to the diamond saloon three men were playing cards at a table sterling knew and feared them as the big three the postmaster handed the postcard to crease wal- den who read dear grace home next week love jim jim cranford's comin back said crease at this announcement capper munn and sheriff sid lucas started jim cranford they echoed the three stared at each other their set faces reflecting the memories roused by that name   ranch romances jim cranford had first won fame as a super-gunman in the sterling coun- ty range war two years before when the cattlemen rose to fight the rustlers who had so long oppressed them jim was only twenty-two then and had never shot at anything but tin cans but when the struggle broke he turned his guns from tin cans to men he beat several professional killers to the draw and led the cowmen to victory in a dozen skirmishes elected sheriff despite his youth he gathered a posse of daredevils and rode up and down the county till the last rustler had been killed jailed or driven out when sterling county was at peace again jim's job was done he resigned his office and took the south trail to sonora with a herd from his father's ranch after delivering the cattle he drifted on alone through mexico a revolution suddenly flared up there and jim seemed to drop out of sight months passing with no word from him meanwhile changes were taking place back home crease walden a crooked rancher got out of jail by political wire-pulling returned to sterling and had a talk with the new sheriff at the diamond saloon sheriff lucas had been one of cranford's deputies but now he sold out his oath of office and joined walden's plot capper munn boss rustler who had fled from cranford's posse returned when walden and lucas sent word to him a swarm of gunmen accom- panied him so the old days were back in sterling county--open rustling killing lawlessness old george cran- ford jim's father had tried to or- ganize resistance as a result he was shot from ambush one night his lands and cattle taken over by the big three the small ranchers disorganized and helpless lacked leadership to re- store peace and law they had one hope if only jim cranford comes back crease walden broke the silence don't let a word of this get out he commanded tearing the postcard to bits turn out the gang to guard all trails and roads south of sterling to watch for cranford that's it--we've got to get cran- ford said capper he's the one man that can beat us and he musn't get away shoot him on sight and pour lead into him till he stops kickin as long as he lives he's dangerous massive bull-like lucas shook his head i worked for that hombre once but i'll fix his clock i'll watch the main trail myself a tall lean rider came up the southeast trail at dusk he had a striking face a face of contradic- tions--a friendly mouth above a stern chin full round cheeks like a boy a curved hawk-like nose and keen bold dark eyes as he passed a nester's cabin at the county line the old nester cried jim cranford jim stopped to shake hands see yuh later i'm in a hurry to see grace and dad he said in his deep mellow voice then yuh ain't heard jim asked the nester didn't yuh get any of our letters why no anyway there wouldn't be any news to hear with everything okay here i got caught in that revo- lution saw lots of fightin and hard ridin with the federalistas and my mail never caught up with me jim sighed been gone seven months breeze i've seen lots of things and had a great time but it's best of all to get home again well so long he said and started away the nester grasped jim's arm say- ing hoarsely wait jim saw the sorrow in the old man's eyes there ain't anything wrong is there a chill went through him what is it pronto--tell me the nester told him at the news of his father's murder jim seemed stunned for a moment then he went nearly mad with grief and rage cry- phantom gunman  ing the rotten killers i'll show them he spun the cylinders of his two guns and ran to his horse what yuh goin to do jim i'm goin to sterling and tear it apart till i get the truth shouted jim then i'll smoke down those killers one by one dad i'll get them for yuh wait cried the nester go slow even the sheriff's with them yuh can't go alone against em all they'll kill yuh before yuh start wait but jim was already racing north his dark eyes blazing and his face a granite mask a wisp of a moon rose above the horizon as he rode madly on as the trail swung to the right to follow a canyon rim four men rose from cover with levelled guns and fired a shot grazed jim's bronc and the animal swerved off the trail toward the precipice a huge man was draw- ing a bead on jim's heart jim spurred and swung the bronc with all his force the beast reared wildly on its hind legs at the very canyon edge and stopped the bullet meant for the rider the stricken horse screamed and tottered on the brink jim flung him- self clear of the saddle but the leap landed him on the treacherous rock of the canyon rim the huge man came up for another shot and jim recognized him lucas cried jim yuh rat i'll get yuh he reached for his gun then the crumbled rock under his feet gave way even as his bronc collapsed a few feet away man and horse fell into the black depths of the canyon at the same in- stant seconds later there was a series of thuds as of bodies ricocheting down the rocks--then a splash and silence lucas grinned let's go to town was all he said the next day they found the bronc and jim's gun at the spot where he had been ambushed and his hat a mile down the river of the body there was no trace he must of washed on downstream further they agreed returning to town lucas exhibited the hat and gun and announced that jim cranford had been shot resisting arrest a shudder of despair went over sterling county cranford was gone what hope was left now grace lee went about dressed in black now but somehow she could not fully believe that jim cran- ford was dead jim had loved her and she loved him there would never be anyone else wait for me grace he had said and she was still waiting she could not accept the grim facts could not tear the hope out of her heart sid lucas joined her one day as she was walking down the street hello she said she hated the man when jim was home lucas had never dared speak to her had merely followed her hungrily with his eyes now however he was smirking bold half possessive but she did not dare turn him away for her father's sake old lee had quavered better be civil to lucas grace he's threatened me we've got to be on the good side of him lucas was explaining that his men watching for a bandit had shot cran- ford in the darkness by mistake i hope yuh don't hold it against me he added we oughta be good friends i'm a good friend to have and a bad enemy grace he grasped her arm possessively i'll be seein yuh to- night her heart felt like lead i suppose so she said dully many strangers mostly crooks and badmen flocked into sterling in the following months there was scar norwalk a rustler from the white mountains who came with several friends things had become too hot for him in his old haunts so he fled to sterling for refuge saw that the pickings were good here and decided to locate  ranch romances charlie thomas agent for an un- scrupulous eastern packer came to establish connections and buy cheap beef from the local rustlers loud flashily dressed a show-off he was quickly attracted to grace and sought her company constantly the rosarios notorious bandits from old mexico passed through sterling they were two brothers jose and miguel swarthy and sinister their shoe-button eyes darting everywhere walden approached them with an offer to join his gang but they refused no señor said jose we play what you call--lone hand they loaded two pack horses with supplies and rode out of town again there was also whisperin a ragged vagrant who drifted into town one morning and attached himself to the diamond saloon he was young his regular even-featured thin-lipped face with its faint scar lines seemed strong but sterling soon found he was no good he spoke only in a husky whis- per his weak eyes were covered by tinted glasses and he seemed a coward he did not carry a gun and at the challenges and insults of toughs he simply shook his head and walked away he became general roustabout at the diamond saloon ran errands cleaned up took an occasional shift at tending bar the patrons scornfully ignored him men drank and quarreled and gambled outlaws held whispered con- ferences over future crimes mean- while silent as ever whisperin would come to their very elbows wielding his broom and they would continue as though he were not there he was harmless despised one evening the cattle buyer came to the diamond saloon and bought the house for the night treating all who came to unlimited free drinks to gain good will for his company un- restrained drunkenness followed oc- casionally someone shot at whisper- in's feet to make him jump a dozen quarrels broke out crease walden and scar norwalk were in one corner shouting at each other there's plenty of room for both of us workin this territory roared the white mountain rustler either you cut me in or i'll force my way in walden walden cursed the other savagely a walden tough named stark stepped in and struck norwalk in the mouth capper interfered and restored peace a group of gunmen boasted of their killings joining them stark drew his gun and pointed out the four notches on the butt someone said bout time yo're addin that fifth stark--the one for old cran-- shut up yuh fool snarled stark the other laughed drunkenly aw be yoreself yo're among friends ain't yuh we all know yuh had a hand in that and there's nothin to worry about now the cub's gone the crowd broke up late the next morning an early riser noticed a paper pinned to the sheriff's bulletin board that had not been there the night before it was printed in pencil and read warning to joe stark bill loring monk ferrel capper munn sid lucas crease walden the murder of my father will be avenged jim cranford stark's name had been crossed out soon a group gathered about the bulletin board talking excitedly some- one roused the sheriff lucas came out sleepy and sullen from a hang- over what's up look--that note lucas read and laughed he tore down the paper bunk some fool practical joker cranford's dead phantom gunman  stark's name was crossed out said a cowboy well what of it you don't think-- lucas began and then shrugged okay i'll go see him but he won't thank me for wakin him at this hour joe stark was beyond waking they found him in his hotel room on the floor dead his face was contorted with horror an unfired gun was in his hand and three bullets in his chest at noon grace lee and lafe jen- nings chanced to meet in front of the general store lafe had been the cran- ford's trusted foreman he worked for walden now with stifled hate in his heart grace asked breathlessly lafe you've heard do you think jim is really alive i wouldn't build up any hopes grace said lafe gently some drunken fool fixed that note why wasn't it written instead of printed so that those of us who know jim's handwritin could really know maybe that's it maybe he doesn't want anyone to be sure just yet sug- gested grace lafe shook his head whisperin came by tipping his hat to grace she nodded absently as he passed i think i'll have to marry lucas eventually she said dully i'd sooner die but it's for dad's sake she clenched her hands if jim would only come if he only would echoed lafe i'd follow him through the gates of hell he shrugged said why talk about impossible things and went on that afternoon the big three held a conference in a quiet corner of the diamond saloon whoever wrote that note put the right names down began crease spare and hawk-like the killer made that yellow stark talk before he shot how else would he know said lucas a hundred ways said crease we shoulda done that job by ourselves those three roughnecks talk when they're drunk everybody's got a pretty good idea about old cranford's finish but what's the note got to do with stark's killin anyway why it's plain-- lucas began crease is right wizened little capper interrupted the sheriff the note was a drunkard's fool joke it wasn't written by the hombre who plugged stark though the killer mighta seen it and crossed out stark's name when he got through no we've got to look elsewhere for that shootin and my guess is scar norwalk crease nodded thoughtfully my idea too stark hit him at the party and he got even he drummed on the table his cold gray eyes narrow we got to tend to that hombre give him the works he's gettin too cocky around here anyway tomorrow say right said lucas raising his huge bulk from his chair capper nodded funny nobody heard those shots remarked capper that's easy laughed crease everybody was pie-eyed except a few hombres like whisperin here how about it whisperin did yuh hear anything whisperin kept on mopping as he shook his head no three of norwalk's gang had been bought off by capper the rest of the out-of-town bunch includ- ing the leader rode out to walden's mountain cabin the next day with crease the local rancher was genial and hospitable promised the norwalk crew a third share of the rustling profits and circulated the bottles freely suddenly crease excused himself ducked outside and the next moment a score of gunmen outlaws and depu- ties intermingled rushed the cabin from all sides it was more of a massa- cre than a battle norwalk and his three attendants were quickly dis- posed of while the big three lost only one man  ranch romances this grim lesson impressed all with two points--don't horn into sterling county don't harm anyone connected with the big three the empty mockery of sterling county law was gone through with the victims were buried shortly after this a pair of masked road agents began to work the trails out of sterling robbing many travel- ers they were vicious gunmen who shot at the faintest show of resistance some thought it was the rosarios meanwhile the eastern cattle buyer offered poor prices so the big three decided to continue sending their stolen herds to mexico his dickering over charlie thomas still lingered to see grace lee he was a harmless windbag and the girl found him more tolerable than the brutal hulking lucas but the sheriff flamed with jealousy and ordered his deputy lor- ing to break it up loring stopped grace and thomas on the street sent the girl on and beat the cattle buyer's face to a pulp the next night there was an after- math it was late the saloon was clos- ing up and crease and lucas stood talking near the front door nearly everyone had gone home long ago and the dark street was deserted loring passed the two saying good night the next moment crease grew rigid and seized his companion's arm look--out there the windows of the saloon threw great rectangles of yellow light across the blackness of the street outside loring stood in the farthest of these rectangles staring into the night be- yond he was a picture of stark terror beneath a face gone sickly gray his jaw dropped his hands hung limp at his sides for the space of three breaths he stood so then his right hand clawed at his gun cleared the holster two red flashes stabbed at him out of the darkness with a roar and loring fell without firing come on shouted crease he and lucas raced outside quickly they bent over loring but he was already dead they looked up and down the street there was no one to be seen and no sound but the chirping of crickets the pair ran back into the saloon murder turn out pronto shouted crease to the bartender and the re- maining patrons this way sid out the back door he'll be gettin away up the alley as they rushed through the back room lucas bumped against someone cursed and whipped out his gun crease cried sharply who's that lucas grunted disgustedly as he peered into an even-featured dark- spectacled face heard a whispered ex- planation about hunting that extra case of bourbon hell it's only whisperin come on they went on into the alley raced in opposite direc- tions found nothing but a single idea filled lucas heavy one-track brain seething with red fury he went on and burst into charlie thomas cabin to find thomas reading there alone what's wrong sheriff never figgered yuh'd have the guts to shoot it out with loring gritted lucas now let's see yuh shoot it out with loring's boss for gosh sake lucas cried the cattle buyer frantically i don't know what you're talkin about my gun ain't been fired for weeks look and see get up and take it coyote roared lucas he cursed and goaded the terror-stricken man and at last thomas rose and made his play lucas beat him to the draw easily and shot him down thomas gun discharging harm- lessly as it fell on the way back to the saloon the sheriff halted abruptly at his bulletin board and struck a match there was what he had feared to find--a fresh duplicate of the cranford note only on this copy loring's name had also been crossed out i will avenge my father's death lucas read aloud phantom gunman  slowly his fury evaporated and changed to fear a sleepy crowd began to gather what's all the shootin asked some- one nothin i can't handle shouted lucas go back to bed that was the beginning of uneasi- ness in the big three spread monk ferrel who stood third on that kill- ers list went about with guns and nerves at hairtrigger tension capper munn threw guards about the town to stop everyone after nightfall and put ferrel in charge of things generally crease walden jeered foolishness norwalk drilled stark the buyer got loring and we got both of them the paper's from the same fool joker stark and loring bein in on the cranford killin with us is just a co- incidence coincidence hell growled ferret- like capper that paper was posted two minutes after loring died--and his name was crossed off i tell yuh there's somebody after us a sort of phantom gunman--jim cranford or somebody posin as him not jim cranford damn yuh shouted lucas in swift fury i saw him die keep yore head sid advised crease if yuh hadn't flew off the handle and gunned thomas so quick we mighta checked him up whoever it is we got to get him or he'll get us finished capper and i'm watchin every bet capper had spies out through the county he even sent men to track down the road agents election day was drawing near with the sheriff's office falling vacant capper sent for the candidate opposing lucas a griz- zled nester and spoke very forcefully the nester withdrew from the run- ning unopposed for the office lucas would have a walkaway capper also sent for lafe jennings yuh used to come to town once a month now it's every day or so what's the idea maybe fer a look at the tall build- ings replied lafe airily can the wisecracks puncher snarled capper we've got no use for yuh take a tip and stay out of sterl- ing from now on the old cranford ex-foreman had to obey capper overlooked no possibility he even wrote to a nation-wide detec- tive agency enclosing a check and an old photograph of jim cranford meanwhile crease scoffed and lucas was busy elsewhere with grace lee three days before election lucas swaggered into the saloon cuffed whisperin good humoredly slapped ferrel on the back and cried to the bartender to set up the house crease understood the reason for this out- burst he had seen lucas kiss grace publicly in parting watched her walk away now tight-lipped her head held high grace had agreed to marry lucas does she love yuh fer yore looks or yore disposition drawled capper she hates me i reckon lucas drank and laughed but she's marryin me just the same his brutal face was aglow with wolfish triumph that's why i drygulched cranford that's why i throwed in with yuh--to get her and fer the girl i'd do it again phantom and all that night the phantom struck again at midnight ferrel started out to inspect the outposts he walked from the diamond saloon toward the southern edge of town--a distance of three hundred yards with guards stationed at both places there was only starlight ferrel had gone down the dark street about halfway when shots rang out--then a cry they found ferrel stretched in the roadway his unfired gun in his hand his animal-like face was ghastly but he was not yet dead he seized crease's arm with a convulsive grip and gasped cranford it's jim cran- ford it was too dark there to discern  ranch romances faces one could see only the outline of men's bodies black against the starry night it couldn't a been cranford said crease yuh couldn't a seen him clear enough to know but i heard his voice i knew jim cranford for years i couldn't be wrong  on that    blood gushed to ferrel's lips crease wiped it away and ferrel went on jim said hello ferrel and i stopped he said turn around rat i'm givin yuh a chance like yuh didn't give my dad make yore play then-- ferrel broke off and laughed crazily it's jim cranford back from the dead he continued again he came back to get me--to get yuh all it was a few minutes later that two men carried the dying killer away lucas had struck a match picked up something now from beside the spot where ferrel had lain the big three gathered close to stare at the scrap of paper ferrel's name crossed off whispered lucas coincidence crease drawled cap- per crease shook his head stark lor- ing ferrel gone only us three left now blow out that match barked cap- per want him to pot-shoot us lucas said he don't work that way he'll shoot it out with us like he did with the others he stared into the night added in a strange hoarse voice maybe it is jim cran- ford who else could throw a gun like that come on are we goin to take this sittin still snap out of it snarled capper call out every man we're movin against this hombre pronto with all we've got pick yoreselves a spot me i'm searchin sterling from top to bottom maybe he ain't out of town yet i'll go out and nab them road agents lucas had caught fire from capper's example maybe they're the ones any shot in the dark's worth tryin i'll take half the gang and comb the ranges said crease let's go though there was furious activity that night the searchers were handi- capped by the fact that they did not know just whom they were looking for capper ransacked sterling and found nothing using secret informa- tion and a decoy lucas trapped the pair of road agents and shot them to death unmasked the bodies proved to be those of the rosario brothers as had been expected crease's party accomplished nothing for all their hard riding and question- ing of sleepy cowmen but as the next day dawned they found crudely let- tered placards scattered everywhere nailed to trees and fence posts say- ing vote for jim cranford for sheriff crease cursed like a madman when he saw that his men destroyed all the signs they came across but enough remained for all of sterling county to read a strange stirring ran through the region like a hidden wave almost every voter went to the polls per- haps they were moved by remem- brance or by blind hope that persisted in spite of facts perhaps it was simply a cynical secret protest against things as they were a preference for a dead honest man over a live scoundrel at any rate they cast their ballots in a strange way the election board was composed of honest men chiefly because the big three had never gone to the trouble of replacing them late election night the last vote counted the chairman of the board announced the results jim cranford is elected sheriff by a majority over sid lucas he wrote though cranford was not a regular candidate his name was written in by the individual voters which is per- fectly legal also though cranford is reported killed on the best authority yet he has not been legally declared dead therefore his election stands lucas was made acting sheriff in phantom gunman  cranford's absence if cranford did not appear to take office within thirty days then lucas as runner-up would get the position by forfeiture old-timers shook their heads there had been a reign of bloodshed and terror and now the climax--a dead man placed in the sheriff's chair few noticed that those slain whether mem- bers of the big three or their victims were all scoundrels and criminals not a single honest man had perished since jim cranford there was nothing on the bulletin board when lucas returned late from seeing grace but several sleepless hours later he went out into the dawn and found this at the diamond saloon--tonight at ten sheriff jim cranford at this the big three assembled lucas was fatalistic to his primitive superstitious mind the ghost of his victim was returning for vengeance crease was bewildered could only stare but capper was glad at last the baffling search for an unknown was over and the showdown near boys our phantom gunman's foot has slipped at last this time he's committed suicide capper cried what d'yuh mean asked crease he's always done what he said he would ain't he capper replied never disappointed us and he won't disappoint us now come hell or high water he aims to be at the saloon at ten tonight well we'll be ready for him warn everybody to stay at home surround the saloon with torches and bonfires light up the ground so a mouse can't cross without bein seen plant all our men in ambush with orders to shoot to kill everyone who comes then whether the phantom travels alone or with a crowd tonight let him come but the thing'll spread around he's bound to hear and stay away protested crease he'll hear but he'll come anyway laughed capper the way i figger this mysterious hombre it's a matter of pride with him never to go back on his word to us he's plumb locoed thataway sid yuh'll see he's real enough and no ghost we'll wait in the saloon if he gets past the gang alive which a million to one he won't we might get the chance to throw lead into him crease crease his hawk face agleam smiled cruelly nine o'clock a dark cloudy night all was ready the trap set the big three waited in the diamond saloon playing stud half a dozen loungers whose curiosity was greater than their fear were there also fill em up again shouted lucas come on where's that bottle he lurched toward the bar and col- lided heavily with whisperin with a snarl he struck the roustabout and sent him sprawling whisperin picked himself up his face expressionless and went on mopping the floor the three snarled at each other over their game and watched the hands of the clock creep around lucas said ferrel heard cranford's voice nothin to it scoffed crease dyin men get locoed notions some- times wonder who it really is and what's his game this fake cranford i've stopped thinkin about that answered capper we bumped off norwalk and thomas and the rosarios on the chance that one of them was our man and we were wrong now ferget it and wait soon we'll know we've done a lot of killin said lucas the cranfords young and old-- stop harpin on that yuh block- head barked crease here's yore mail capper said the bartender it's been layin here since mornin impatiently capper waved him away the bartender watched him how  ranch romances strange that this hard desperate trio who with their gang had terrorized the entire country should themselves be terrorized in turn by one man now the time was growing short and the three threw down their cards and lined up against the bar facing the front door guns ready crease peered out through a crack in the win- dow shade the fires made it as bright as day outside the gang crouched ready whisperin finished his task and went into the back room the bar- tender stopped polishing the bar ex- cept for the hoarse breathing of the men and the tick of the clock there was no sound in the room it was nearly ten crease's laugh grated in the silence hell we're a pack of fools he won't come how could he come the clock struck--ten measured clanging strokes all eyes in the room stared at it as though fascinated as the last stroke died away there was a breath of air the ghost of a sound they all spun around as one man at the back room door stood whis- perin his even-featured face was tense and hard his tinted glasses were off and for the first time they really noticed his eyes--dark keen blazing there were two gunbelts about his waist now his hands tensed above the gun butts he spoke in a deep mellow voice that filled the room make yore play it was a voice they all knew beyond any doubt--the voice of jim cranford the big three stared this thing could not be jim cran- ford whom they had slain could not be alive yet the man with the familiar face of whisperin had jim cranford's eyes jim cranford's voice again he was talking in tones that rang as hard as iron make yore play yuh murderin coyotes i'm jim cranford crease made the first break lurch- ing sideways as he clawed for his holster jim cranford's guns seemed to leap from their holsters like twin striking snakes and roared walden's death song capper was next in the line he cleared leather but before he could level his weapon two slugs caught him in the chest and he died without firing then lucas--in the fraction of a second that had elapsed he had time to draw but just as he pulled trigger cranford shot and lucas convulsive grip sent his bullet wild lucas held himself erect with an arm across the bar and fired again cranford jerked and steadied returned the fire with both guns and lucas went down wisps of acrid gunsmoke curled upward cranford turned his blazing eyes on the bystanders as he waved them away from the door they scut- tled like sheep into a far corner huddled there harmlessly outside the gang amazed at the outburst of gun- fire in their midst came from their hiding places and gathered at the front door there were shouts of capper lucas what's wrong in there a gunman opened the door stared for a moment at the scene within at his leaders stretched on the floor with a gasp he reached toward his hip but cranford guns levelled at his heart cried leave it there the man's fingers jerked away from his gun butt as though the touch burned him and he slammed the door to jim cranford took the nickeled star off lucas shirt and pinned it to his own in the name of the law throw down yore guns he cried he levelled his guns at the closed door ready for a rush outside the leaderless ruffians whispered together uncertain suddenly a swarm of men swept out of the night upon them a warning shot went over their heads a cry rang out throw em up pronto the tables were turned the gangsters had been drawn from their hiding places now stood outlined in the light of their own fires two or three resisted and were shot down the rest of them surrendered without a struggle phantom gunman  lafe jennings burst into the saloon and at the sight of him jim grinned and put his guns away the two com- pared watches we came about twenty seconds late said lafe close enough laughed jim yo're bleedin boy cried the old ex-foreman a scratch bullet raked my ribs said jim he took a glass of whiskey from the trembling bartender and dashed it on the wound stay here in charge lafe i'll tend to the rest as jim started away lucas opened his eyes and called faintly jim went to the ex-sheriff's side he stooped down and lucas ran exploring fingers over his arm don't savvy this but reckon    yo're real jim mind shak- in hands jim pressed the hand in silence reckon yuh win everything    girl and all said lucas well i'd  do it    all over again his breathing rattled then his defiant grin became fixed and his head fell back jim laid the body down and went outside he gave orders to lafe's men sent part of them to lock up the prisoners gradually the group dis- persed and jim was left alone beside a glaring bonfire then a slim white-clad figure came out of the darkness toward him it was grace lee who had been waiting she approached slowly peering at his face--at his straight nose and flat cheeks and thin lips and the fine scar lines at the edge of his jaw a de- spairing sob burst from her quivering lips no no it can't be as she came a step closer and he faced toward the fire suddenly her violet eyes bright- ened she gasped jim cranford's eyes why-- jim asked in his deep mellow voice grace don't you know me the next moment grace was in his arms her arms about his neck jim jim you've come back i thought you were dead jim held her close come he said gently i'll take yuh home meanwhile at the saloon the bodies had been taken away and lafe with several men stood guard outside the loungers gathered at the bar talking excitedly how could that be jim cranford cranford didn't look any- thing like this hombre the bartender said here's capper's mail he'll never need it now he opened the envelopes to find a couple of circulars then at the sight of a letter he stiffened get this boys he cried while the others closed around report on james cranford dear mr munn we finally traced james cranford to the mountain city hospital he arrived there last april suffering from several broken ribs and a broken arm his face terribly smashed and infected he ex- plained he had fallen over a cliff landing by chance on a ledge part way down the side which saved his life afterwards he had drifted downstream on a raft until rescued by cowboys after cranford was out of danger several operations were performed on his face plastic surgery being used to remedy his disfigurement it was highly successful when the plastic surgery was finished cranford had a new face --even well proportioned features in place of his former irregular ones and only a few very faint scars showed after a four-month stay when cran- ford was about to leave the hospital he asked the chief surgeon would folks who knew me all my life ever recognize me now not a chance declared the surgeon we'll see said cranford as he went away we believe that cranford posing as a stranger is now in your very midst unrecognized we enclose a photograph from the hospital records of james cranford as he appears now respectfully standard detective agency the bartender laid down the letter that had been read too late and stared at the photograph so the whisperin roustabout i've been orderin around was really jim cranford the next night grace and jim were on the lee ranch house porch under the moon after that plastic surgery i couldn't be recognized ex-  ranch romances cept by my eyes and my voice so i used dark glasses and a fake whisper to fix that said jim i came back to get even for dad's death--hung around the saloon until i got a clue then i cornered stark alone forced him to tell who the others were then beat him to the draw afterward i went after the others one by one in a fair fight soon as the shooting was over i put my gunbelt under my shirt and ducked the gang saw me said it's only whisperin and rushed on by to find the killer i put lafe jennings wise and he got together some close-mouthed men he could trust after that strange election i had official standin lafe's boys were ready and it was time to come out in the open for the show- down i reckon that's all but why didn't you tell me you were here--alive asked grace i couldn't i had a big job to do yuh'd have worried even more better for yuh not to know till it was over he sighed well it's over now dad can rest easy in his grave yes that's ended said grace when yuh didn't recognize me i had a strange feelin as if i'd lost yuh said jim does it matter to yuh my face bein changed do yuh feel that i'm a stranger she looked at him smiling you look better than before jim but ap- pearance doesn't matter anyway i know that inside you're the same jim cranford i've always known then somethin new is just begin- nin said jim the hard lines had faded out of his face his dark eyes were soft adoring gently he drew her toward him i mean our life together grace i've always loved yuh--if yuh'll have me wordless she raised her radiant face to his the youngest brand expert already at four years of age miss frances peters of midland texas is accounted a cattle brand expert she can draw

myrtle juliette corey to cook or not to cook that was the question such a predicament faced brady wilson bronc-buster par excellence when all the time he longed to perform some heroic act that would enable him to cut a figure in the eyes of pretty doreen brady wilson drew in his horse at the crest of a ridge about a mile out of town to gaze down into the valley at the cluster of houses and stores with the railroad loading chutes and corrals which comprised baxter then he turned in the saddle for a sweeping look over the surrounding country this range sure suits me he mused aloud next thing is to find some out- fit that's looking for a first-class cow- puncher grinning at his own conceit he dis- played a double row of white even teeth his gray eyes twinkled while tiny lines radiating from their corners betrayed a sense of humor brady had drifted up from arizona with the determination to locate him- self somewhere in western colorado a section which had always appealed to him but a week's search discovered no outfit in need of his services while an unlucky session of poker had made it imperative that he connect with some paying occupation within a few hours horse saddle and equipment were of the best which would assure any dis- cerning eye that brady wilson was a good hand an asset to any ranch payroll however luck was against him for there happened at that time to be an oversupply of first-class cow- punchers in that section he rode slowly into town to dis- --ranch romances--first sept   ranch romances mount in front of the general store as he looped one rein about the hitch-rail the screen door at the top of the steps was pushed open and held by a cowboy whose face was wreathed with smiles as he bowed awkwardly to the girl who emerged several parcels in her arms thanks bud she said her voice like the unexpected chiming of a silver bell on clear morning air already brady's glance was unobtru- sively enveloping her not a contour of her lovely features and graceful figure escaping his eye soft tendrils of brown hair with bronze high-lights evaded the confinement of her straw hat the brim of which was cleverly turned back to frame the sweet oval of her face thick lashes exactly matching the curls which caressed her forehead and half concealed the pink-lobed ears fringed eyes of so brilliant a blue that brady could think of nothing in the world to match them her whole being radiated daintiness the clear skin just lightly touched with tan the hands that were graceful and dimpled without be- ing too small the high-arched feet as she descended the steps her glance passed lightly over brady meeting his eyes for just an instant to leave him with a breathless helpless feeling the cowboy she had called bud was already clattering down the steps to follow her to an automobile standing at the end of the hitch-rack he opened the car door giving clumsy assistance with the parcels but his only words were good-by doreen as she drove away not until girl and car disappeared around a corner did brady wilson re- cover his powers of locomotion suffi- ciently to mount the steps and pursue his original intention of entering the store to make some inquiries doreen he exclaimed under his breath sounds as pretty as she looks i'll sure stay around here if i have to hold some rancher up for a job abel barnes was more than willing to dispense information while he weighed out sugar and wrapped parcels for the group around the counter but he shook his head lugubriously at brady's questions ain't heard of anyone wantin a cowpuncher he wheezed peering sharply at brady from little eyes al- most smothered with fat but here comes jordan gates--he's foreman for the cross bar over temeech way-- he'll know if any of them ranchers are short a hand brady wilson didn't care for the ap- pearance of the slender self-assured fellow who pushed open the screen door with the manner of one who ex- pects to command instant attention from all and sundry he favored brady with a supercilious glance turning back to give him a cool stare as the storekeeper put a question no gates drawled there isn't much demand around here for drifting cowpunchers there was almost a sneer in the words straight and steady brady's gray eyes looked into the greenish ones set in the narrow closely shaven face of the cross bar foreman then without comment he swung around to a man standing nearby to engage him in a dis- cussion of the surrounding country instantly jordan gates betrayed hostil- ity the manner of the stranger had too openly disregarded him scorned his importance any retort would have been less exasperating than this calm ignoring of his presence the antagonism between the two men was mutual with this difference-- brady wilson actually dismissed gates from his thoughts but the latter held a rancor so lively that it demanded some outlet since it was saturday a number of ranchers were in town but none was in need of a rider as he strolled about brady again encountered the cowboy he had first seen on the steps of the store from him by diplomatic ques- tions was extracted the information that the girl who had driven off in the car was doreen landis that was all brady was too sensitive to his own show em cowboy  sudden interest in her to push his in- quiries further near the end of the afternoon it be- came a question as to whether there was any job in the entire neighborhood open to a cowpuncher but as brady wilson's need increased so with each advancing hour did his determination become greater he would not leave the section of country that was home to doreen landis finally as he strolled towards the post office thinking he might encounter someone else from out of town the storekeeper beckoned from his doorway hey came in barnes wheezy voice hey young feller i just heard of something if you're right set on a ranch job sure am brady answered turning to mount the steps abel barnes surveyed him for a mo- ment with pursed lips we-ell he said slowly gates was just in here on his way home and he'd heard of a place on the oliver ranch--the double o they need a feller bad soon's he can get there one of their men broke both his legs this mornin wilson nodded as he heard the name of the outfit to work under jordan gates would have been a pretty tough proposition but he wondered why the storekeeper regarded him with that lurking doubt in his eyes probably the double o was a hard outfit to work for brady squared his shoulders thanks he said i'll head right that way he was thinking i can stand it till i land something better i've gotta stay till i get acquainted with doreen landis those blue eyes of hers have got all the magnets in the world beat i couldn't ride away from here nossir barnes gave explicit directions re- garding the trail to the double o just tell jude oliver you've come to take hank's place he said again giv- ing brady an odd close look he seemed about to add something then closed his lips tightly as if to imprison the words anything the matter with oliver's outfit the cowboy ventured with a humorous glance no no--nothing a-tall came the quick denial jude's the finest hombre hereabouts couldn't tie to a better boss humph brady ejaculated as he turned away from the store he thought there's something queer about the whole deal wonder what it is but he headed at once for the double o it would take brisk riding to reach the ranch before dark and he had the urge of an empty stomach as he rode from town he reflected that doreen landis had turned in that same direc- tion when she drove off in the morning which offered hope that she might live somewhere in the neighborhood of the oliver outfit the sun was just vanishing below the peak of an upthrust mountain leaving a golden glory diffused over the sky when he turned from the high- way to follow a grassy road towards the ranch buildings a half mile distant the nearer he came the more pleasant and well kept the place appeared be- sids the spacious ranch house his ob- servant gaze located a roomy bunk- house numerous neat outbuildings and several pole corrals brady smiled already he was aware of a comfortable home-like feeling looks good to me he decided the next thing is to find doreen voices came from the bunkhouse it seemed supper must be over but the clear air bore the aroma of coffee hint- ing that it was not too late for a warm meal as brady approached the house a heavy-shouldered man whose roughly carved features indicated a character of some force emerged from the door he gave the cowboy a quick keen glance brady reined in howdy he said i guess you must be mr oliver--my name's brady wilson heard you're looking for a man to replace someone  ranch romances named hank that had an accident to- day while he was speaking the cowboy was aware that another man came to the door halting there to speak to someone inside the house only part of his figure was visible but that was strongly suggestive of the cross bar foreman oliver's eyes held a flicker of sur- prise as they glanced over the strange cowboy's horse and equipment then he said sure--mighty glad to see you wilson didn't know what we were going to do--not a man around that could fill hank's place light and put your horse in the corral before brady could reply the door opened and gates emerged for the second time that day his greenish eyes flickered over the cowboy then he drawled as he descended the steps you said you'd be glad to go to work any place i didn't know then about this job--but i'm sure it will just suit you there was no particular ex- pression in the tone yet brady felt an implied sneer gates moved on across the yard to a horse that was tied to a tree calling back so long oliver--see you soon so long the rancher returned walking towards the corral at brady's side there's a bunk in the cook shack he went on and hank slept there i guess there's everything you'll need to get breakfast in the morning you can get whatever you need from the storehouse--i'll give you the key brady thought his ears must be play- ing him tricks before he could frame a question however the rancher said we're up against it here without a cook as my wife isn't well and my niece has all she can do at the house sure glad you came along brady wilson took a sudden dizzy- ing mental somersault well i'll be damned he exclaimed to himself they've hired me for a cook and it's a put-up job of that mister fore- man gates to humiliate me--humph halting his stride he was on the point of flat refusal when second thought re- strained him i haven't got a dime--and not an- other thing in sight guess i'll have to stick and i'll hand that hatchet- faced fellow a surprise maybe he won't get such a big laugh after all there's one consolation--i can make sourdough biscuits around nine-tenths of the cooks i ever saw so brady wilson accepted the situa- tion grinning ruefully to himself as he spread his blankets in the former cook's bunk he wondered what his recent mates would think if they knew of his predicament if i've got any enemies they'd sure be tickled but this ain't gonna last more'n a month i'll get my pay and pull out you can't keep a good cowpuncher down i'm still within ridin distance of doreen when i get through wrastlin pots i'll look her up the first thing he was tired and with that soothing thought brady fell into a slumber which lasted so long he had to move at double quick time to build the fire and have breakfast for the five ravenous punchers who stormed the cook shack at break o day he was aware of their sidelong looks of appraisal guess they sense i ain't no ordinary cook he grinned to himself but i ain't saying a word let em think what they like--some of these days i'll show em a thing or two then they can boast that they're the only hombres that ever was nourished by the culinary masterpieces of brady wilson top cowpuncher of arizona and colorado he smothered the urge that rose within him as the men's spurs jingled off towards the corrals ever since he could remember morning had meant mounting a horse to ride out over the range for a few minutes he hated the big iron stove in the corner wanted to fling the pots and pans as far as he could and run from the place there was a sour note in his grin now as he surveyed the remains of breakfast an- ticipating with sudden keenness the thirty other breakfasts he must prepare show em cowboy  before he could hit the trail with a month's pay in his pocket oppressed by this thought he moved to the doorway throwing back his head to inhale a revivifying breath of the fresh morning air but he stopped mouth open his entire body stiffening as if from the impact of a sudden blow the doorway of the ranch house kitchen opposite framed a vision of radiant loveliness but brady wilson would rather have faced an array of forty-fives than the girl whose vivid blue eyes flashed a glance across the open space straight into his amazed ones he believed there was a flash of surprise over her face then her red lips formed a slight smile a tantalizing elusive smile and she turned back into the house damn brady exclaimed aloud re- treating hastily from sight how did she get here    oh suddenly he understood oliver had mentioned a niece--doreen landis of course she lived at the ranch--it was her home he experienced no thrill of delight that he would be able to see her every day instead not an inch of his six feet of muscular slenderness but blushed with the ignominy of his posi- tion the bunkhouse cook could the pride of a top-hand suffer keener humiliation and was a cowboy ever in a more exasperating predicament sight of the cook stove now pro- duced positive nausea he would go away at once but no--he couldn't to leave now would be to cover himself with greater indignity than to stick it out for the month he originally in- tended but even brady wilson's humor could find no amusement in the situation fear of encountering the girl kept him within the shelter of the cook house none of the men would be in for dinner and he delayed until long past the noon hour to go to the store- room not until he no longer heard sounds of activity around the ranch kitchen did he venture across the yard then he moved quickly with furtive glances over his shoulder as he slipped the key into the padlock he heard feminine voices issuing from an upstairs window in the big house one he recognized as belonging to doreen she's safe up there he thought with a sigh of relief from the well-stocked shelves he selected supplies to last a couple of days glances at doreen from safe con- cealment were preferable to personal encounters while he labored under the stigma of bunkhouse cook as he emerged from the storeroom the afternoon breeze bore words from that upstairs window straight to his ears i thought he was a cowboy when x saw him in baxter that morning came in the girl's clear sweet tones lots of fellows that aren't any good at cowpunching fall back on cooking an older rather whining voice said we had one once before that was a fine cook but he was too lazy to be any good on the range damn brady muttered his ears reddening he quickened his steps too he didn't want to hear doreen's reply to those comments no matter what she said right then it would be unendurable for some moments he cherished the idea that he would set a supper before the crew which would give every man in the outfit indigestion in his present mood their sufferings would bring brady wilson positive enjoyment but he repudiated that plan no lasting balm for his pride could come from such a course the only trail for him to take was the one that led through thirty days of cooking for the oliver outfit after that he'd show folks it was a relief when the men came to supper they talked of range mat- ters of the experiences of a hard day working cattle on the rimrocks of a hundred subjects that interested brady momentarily he was able to forget that his had been the ignominious task of peeling the vegetables they ate with such gusto  ranch romances you'd oughta ve seen the way that ornery black horse i was ridin turned to buckin when i got out on rocky point today a lathe-like cowboy with carroty hair exclaimed he acted like he was close kin to that roan devil dynamite over to the cross bar ha ha burst out the square-faced straw boss an i s'pose he didn't spill you none he did not you're laughin duffy because you got im on my string well he ain't goin to pile me duffy grinned red sure thinks he can ride he declared it's a wonder he don't go over to the cross bar and try dynamite i have thought about it the cow- boy asserted stoutly somebody's go- ing to ride that roan sometime--might as well be me and i could find plenty of use for that five hundred simoleons warner offers to the hombre that can stay with the buckin roan devil must be some horse brady ex- claimed duffy nodded emphatically he is worst one ever known around here thad warner's had him to a lot of rodeos and nobody's ever rode him yet thad's a great gambler--loves a bet he's offered five hundred dollars to any cowpuncher that can ride dynamite slick and stay till he quits buckin the straw boss tilted his cup to drain the last drops of coffee then turned back to brady wilson talk- in of horses that sorrel you rode in here looks as if he'd be a pretty good cow-horse he's the best cut-horse i ever saw brady replied is that so duffy's eyes sparkled how about a little trade seems too bad not to let him do his stuff ye-ah red put in you don't need a cut-horse to pack you around this reminder of his present status among the group of cowboys nettled brady my horse ain't for sale he said with finality it wasn't easy to hold his tongue and accept the position so uncomfortably thrust upon him but he knew it was not the time for explanations if he could manage to hold out for the month he would be in a position to do some laughing himself the next day brady contrived to keep close within his quarters it seemed to him that he never had seen a girl so fond of walking out of doors as was doreen he knew that she did considerable work yet she was con- tinually appearing in the yard and she passed the cook house five times on various trips to the corrals she seemed to be much interested in the saddle stock each time he saw her brady's heart executed a new measure of syn- copation never before had a girl so affected him and the mere sight of doreen landis plunged him into a woeful state of bashfulness darn it he exclaimed if i had a good horse under me an a rope in my hand i wouldn't be scared none of her for forty-eight hours he success- fully evaded speech with the girl but luck turned on the third day doreen had not appeared since the noon hour and a cautious reconnoiter of the prem- ises encouraged belief that it would be safe to pay a visit to the corrals brady's horse had been turned into the pasture but there were several likely- looking cow-ponies in the pole en- closure and it would be almost an ad- venture to go down and look them over he felt like a released prisoner the skies took on a deep blue the air was sweet and balmy while the mountains rimmed in the horizon with a beauty he never before appreciated brady was engrossed in sizing up a smart-looking little bay when he was startled almost into panic by a sweetly modulated voice at his very elbow i've been looking for one of the boys to saddle a horse for me is there anyone around he whirled to discover doreen stand- ing disturbingly close to his side she was so much prettier than he had thought when observing her from a show em cowboy  distance that he was forced to swallow twice before he could speak n-no he stammered i--i mean there's nobody around but me b-but i'll catch your horse and saddle him thanks she returned was there just a shade of doubt in her tone that suggestion brought the color to his face until he felt as if his cheeks were on fire i'll ride the gray she said turning back to the house and calling over her shoulder he's easy to catch and i'll be ready in five minutes brady glowered at the inoffensive gray easy to catch she thinks i don't know enough to rope a horse he grumbled i'm sure gonna quit this job pronto his ire rose when the pony gave him no trouble at all you're nothin but a darned old plug he raged a mere baby could saddle you up why in blazes don't you show a little self- respecting spirit so's i can let her see i ain't just a sourdough mixer although he accomplished the task quickly brady wilson had never sad- dled a horse with such care doreen appeared as he fastened the latigo thanks she said again while her lips assumed the slight smile with which she had favored him on his first morning at the ranch that smile instantly melted his de- termination to depart in fact so mesmeric was its power that he could not even move from the spot where his feet seemed glued she sprang lightly to the saddle and loped away i sure act just like a dumb pot- wrastler he raged at himself walking slowly back to the cook house he had no further desire for exploration out- side even if the coast was clear seclu- sion where he could anathematize the foreman of the cross bar was what he wanted at that particular time that jordan gates disliked me at first sight and i guess the feeling was mutual all right he thought but i wonder if he's getting the fun he counted on outa the poor joke he sprung i'll get even with him some- time but when i do i'll be darned sure to get my laugh brady's rancor towards the cross bar foreman was not lessened that evening when as he stood at the long table washing dishes gates rode into the yard tying his horse with the man- ner of one familiar with the place and walking nonchalantly to the house brady wilson had no ear for cowboy gossip that night all his efforts at hearing were concentrated on the sounds brought from the ranch house on the evening breeze these added to his state of unrest oliver's deep laughter came at intervals then some- one struck a few chords on the piano and doreen sang brady took a seat on the bench outside the cook house never did ballads so enthrall a listener if he only could have forgotten that she was singing to jordan gates the cowboy would have been in an earthly heaven presently a false note in the harmony was supplied by duffy's nasal tones audible from the bunkhouse gates sure likes music--comin three times a week to hold a concert wonder how long it'll be fore he coaxes the song- bird over to the cross bar to stay aw i can't see what miss doreen'd want of that piano-playin cow- puncher red could be heard grum- bling cowpuncher came scornfully in another voice he ain't no puncher jordan gates is foreman--and don't no- body forget it an he's only a cowboy by adoption anyhow he ain't no son of the cow country at that moment the song came to an end and brady was glad so that hombre's playin her accompaniments he thought resentfully jealously imagining the scene in the ranch house he remained on the bench until gates took his departure about an hour later the voices of both oliver and his niece were audible bidding the guest good night he was gratified to discover that doreen did not come out-  ranch romances side for an added word with the cross bar foreman twenty-six more days o cookin brady groaned then he hummed ironically eleven more months an ten more days they're gonna turn me loose eleven more months an ten more days an i'll be outa the calaboose from that moment something be- sides the coffee boiled in the cook house with every hour he spent there brady's resentment mounted higher mister piano-playin foreman better watch out when i cut loose from that stove he vowed it'll be my turn to play a few jokes seemingly careless questions elicited from the boys no hint of where he might get a cowboy's job when the thirty days were up but he doggedly assured himself that he would find one and as much as possible he managed to keep out of doreen's sight each time her glance rested on him he could scarcely hold his head in its usual erect position while his cheeks always burned hotly doggone it he thought she ain't goin to be able to think of me as any- thing but a cook it'll take me a long time to live this down i'll have to do some lively cowpunchin to make her forget seein me mix sourdough and peel spuds for the oliver crew about every second day or evening jordan gates appeared at the double o his visits rasped brady almost un- endurably and he agreed with red who exclaimed at supper one night when gates had just ridden up to the house if i was thad warner i'd tell that feller i didn't want a foreman that did his bossin by long distance you'd think it was this ranch jord gates is runnin the second time brady had speech with doreen was late one afternoon the cross bar foreman was at the house and it seemed a good opportunity to pay a visit to the storeroom to reach which it was necessary to pass uncom- fortably close to the kitchen door and one could never tell when the girl might be busy there just as he was bending over a sack to scoop sugar into his big tin can-- and with no previous sound to warn of her approach--doreen's voice startled him rising with a jerk he found her at his side as she had been on the former occasion at the corral and the disturbing elusive smile was again on her lips i need some things she said sim- ply and i thought you would reach them down from the shelves for me s-sure sure--glad to he mumbled hating himself for the wave of con- fusion which washed over him the late sunshine pouring through the doorway brought out the high-lights in her hair fascinating him he could scarcely remove his gaze from the soft curls capping her head and when he did he found himself in the fresh diffi- culty of looking straight into her eyes he felt himself sinking down    down    into their intensely blue depths this spell was not broken until she spoke then her voice seemed to come from a long ways off i want some coffee some soda and a bottle of that vanilla brady turned to the shelf dazedly trying to locate the articles he reached down several cans striving wildly to find something to say no--no doreen halted him merri- ment in her voice one can of coffee's enough and vanilla please--not iodine and the soda's there beside the rice not looking into her face he handed her the last article then turned hastily to replace the extra cans of coffee on the shelf hoping she would go at once but she halted on the threshold with an exclamation oh i almost forgot--i need flour brady still had sense enough to re- member that a sack of flour weighed fifty pounds that was no burden for a girl i'll carry it in for you he offered still without facing her show em cowboy  she thanked him moving to the threshold but she waited for him to lift the sack and join her keeping at his side as they went to the kitchen just set the flour on that chair she directed as he started towards the bin that was pulled half out of the wall cupboard i'll fix it when i make the biscuits and thanks a lot temptation was too great again brady looked at her and she smiled-- a real smile this time that dawned in her eyes to come into full radiance on her lips he did not hear steps ap- proaching through the dining room with the stunning force of bullets came words edged with patronizing scorn oh so you're cooking for the house too brady turned his head to stare into jordan gate's greenish eyes doreen spoke instantly no he just helped me to carry in some supplies the cross bar foreman's gaze swept the kitchen halted briefly at the flour bin then came to brady wilson with real hatred but he addressed the girl i see--but you don't have to go to the cook shack for help when i'm around why didn't you call me you're much too dressed up to be handling flour she laughed brady left the kitchen but he could hear gates commenting in derogatory tones that fellow's not like the boys you're used to around here he's just a drifting no-account--glad to wrastle pots you can't treat him friendly like you do our boys because he won't un- derstand he'll take advantage no doreen's voice held a ques- tioning inflection he is very polite-- and quite shy i tell you you've got him wrong forgive me doreen i don't like to see you stoop to be nice to such a worth- less fellow indeed now she spoke crisply there's no occasion for your criticism jordan--none at all i think there is he flared back with anger when you get him to carry in flour you don't need just to have a chance to flirt with him to brady's astonishment doreen's laughter rang out with infectious gaiety don't be silly jordan her voice came clearly followed at once by the booming tones of jude oliver who had just come up from the corral greeting the visitor with no idea of the recent scene brady hurried back to the cook house mi-gosh he breathed that flour bin was most half full i won- der    that wonder combined with the ex- citing memories of his recent en- counter rendered brady immune to the usual disgust with his cook's duties and he allowed himself to dream that evening that doreen had perhaps been curious to discover what he really was like maybe she was the tiniest bit in- terested however by morning his doubts returned he remembered the laughter in her eyes as they stood in the storeroom she's just having fun he con- cluded she thinks i'm what her aunt said that afternoon when they was talk- ing--i'm a no-good puncher that's fell back on cookin during the ensuing days brady sometimes felt sure that doreen was watching him but she made no fur- ther attempt at speech until almost a week had passed then she was quite impersonal and she did not smile in fact she seemed to have erected a little barrier about herself brady wondered wrathfully if gates had after all af- fected her with his remarks meanwhile there was excitement among the crew red had announced his intention of trying to ride the for- midable roan bucking horse owned by thad warren of the cross bar while his mates were ready to back him with encouragement there was no feeling of confidence that he would make it the best riders in the locality including some famous rodeo hands had failed and while red had plenty of assurance  ranch romances he lacked staying power--something essential to any man who would ride dynamite to a finish the third sunday of brady wilson's month as cook was the one set for the contest but on the previous friday red's horse fell bruising his rider badly and breaking three ribs at first red was determined to ride dynamite anyhow the matter was under hot dis- cussion at the corrals on saturday afternoon when jordan gates rode up we'll put off that ride of red's oliver told the cross bar foreman of course gates agreed in his usual manner of mingled superiority and patronage he wouldn't have a chance--be licked before he hit the saddle too bad doreen said sympatheti- cally aware of red's disappointment i was all ready to go over and cheer for him maybe one of the other boys would like to try gates suggested as one who believes he is uttering an ab- surdity but the words hit brady wilson like a sharp spur rowel he continued to lean easily against the corral fence but there was nothing languid in the ex- pression of his eyes as he said coolly sure--i'll go over and give dyna- mite a try all eyes turned towards the cook jordan gates laughed with loud abandon good joke he gasped brady drew himself erect there was a calm smile on his lips but his jaw set with determination no joke he said i mean it i'll be over sunday surprise incredulity then admira- tion for his audacity passed over the faces of the double o cowboys the rancher himself turned to give brady a long appraising glance but oliver's expression was inscrutable gates gave vent to another outburst of laughter all right cookie he said con- descendingly i'll tell the boss jude oliver gates and the girl moved towards the house while the cowboys burst into eager argument but brady wilson said little yes i can ride pretty fair he told duffy i know what i'm about the straw boss shook his head he believed that the new cook might have other than culinary attainments but he knew too much about dynamite to feel like encouraging brady in such folly when he thought the matter over calmly brady was surprised at himself i'm considerable out of practice--rid- in buckers he reflected and it looks like i've taken on something pretty big but i couldn't stand it any longer--had to bust loose and do something now i've got to ride to win i'm plumb sick of that gates hombre laughin so much around here arrived at the cross bar ranch sun- day afternoon brady wilson found a sizable crowd of neighboring ranchers and cowpunchers gathered there any hint of an attempt to ride the outlaw dynamite always drew eager specta- tors he felt a certain quietness in the atmosphere--a tenseness which was hardly warranted by such an event and which could be accounted for only by the fact that he was unpopular with the crowd they think jude oliver's cook's got unlimited nerve to try to ride a horse that's thrown all the best riders in this end of the cow country brady decided jordan gates was very officious dressed in his sunday best even his boots polished till they shone like a new stove he went about repeating the phrase he had coined for the oc- casion glad to see you out for the cooking exhibition dynamite's going to roll a sourdough biscuit for us directly maybe doreen landis said arch- ing her brows oddly when gates sprung the remark on her while the oliver crew had appeared more or less indifferent natural loyalty for a member of their own outfit began to crop out brady's ear caught red assuring jordan gates he may not show em cowboy  ride him slick but i'll bet you a month's wages he will ride him thanks red brady said to him- self as he carried his saddle out into the big round corral where the raw- boned roan had been cut out by himself men were lined up around the fence watching for the most part their ex- pressions indicated that they already knew what the outcome would be brady laid the saddle down carefully on its side then unbuckled his lariat disturbed by the crowd on the fence and by the sight of man and saddle in the corral dynamite trotted nervously about head up emitting an occasional snort from his wide full nostrils brady ran out a small loop and with a neat back-handed throw the rope snapped around the neck of the roan he reared striking at the rope with front feet then charged a few times before allowing the cowboy to walk up to him brady took his time but had no especial difficulty putting on hacka- more and saddle the outlaw had been saddled so often that he was no longer much disturbed over that part of the procedure from the corner of his eye the cow- boy saw doreen standing on the seat of a wagon that had been drawn up beside the corral to afford a good view for the women spectators her eyes were shin- ing with excitement and her face mirrored a tense expression i've got the opportunity i've been praying for brady wilson told him- self his heart beating high as he pre- pared to mount and she's there watching--old roany you're as good as rode the crowd had been exchanging good-natured jibes and offering free advice but dead silence fell as brady a twisted ear in his left hand grabbed the saddle horn with his right then he eased his foot into the stirrup and smooth as a trout leaping a falls went into the saddle dynamite exploded brady knew in- stantly that the horse had been appro- priately named he seemed to fly into a million pieces that left nothing but a saddle to ride a saddle that was caught by first one then another of the leaping flying twisting fragments of what had been a horse a lone saddle falling shooting sideways rolling changing direction and shape with the speed of a comet ground and corrals became a blur then blotted out alto- gether the world held nothing but himself and the terrifically jolting sad- dle that pounded him almost into in- sensibility it was uncanny the way those pieces of horse flew apart or came together with that peculiar twist and horrible jolt which centered in the small of the back each impact seeming powerful enough to catapult the rider into the next county brady knew the roan was a long- winded bucker--just how long no one had ever stayed with him to find out the cowboy had previously made up his mind to attempt no grandstand ride there was too much at stake he did not fan the bucker with quirt or spur beyond the natural strokes that would help keep his balance with the momentum of that whirling slamming ball of lightning dynamite was a glutton for endur- ance after his first cyclonic round he slowed down to straight pitching a few seconds this all but cost brady his seat for he relaxed a trifle then the roan turned on his second tornado of hell and brimstone this was a more ferocious effort than the first and brady knew he was up against the ride of his life shouts came dimly to his ears his brain seemed pounded to numbness then a certain girlish voice penetrated his dulled mind clear as the tone of a violin take it out of him brady show em cowboy show em there was no mistaking that voice its vibrating eagerness his vision cleared his muscles caught the flying pieces were able to hold them together a lot of electricity was disappearing from the jolts dynamite was actually  ranch romances slowing down he broke into a buck- ing run circled the corral a few more times then stopped short planting his forefeet stiffly his sides worked like a bellows brady looked up warner sat on the top rail of the corral a few feet dis- tant did i ride him slick you sure did the old cowman agreed readily and what's more you put up the best ride i ever saw get down--you've earned your money all right brady stepped off removed saddle and hackamore from the panting roan and carried them through the gate to his own horse he had a passing glimpse of the cross bar foreman far away on the fringe of the crowd but just then he felt little interest in jordan gates doreen landis still stood in the wagon and for a second brady wilson gazed straight into her eyes then he was surrounded by the jubilant double o cowboys he didn't mind cooking supper for the outfit that night the afternoon's performance had removed all stigma from his present position but he found that he was still seized with con- fusion when he imagined himself ap- proaching doreen doggone it he assured himself she was cheering me on--she wanted me to win--and i ain't going to be afraid of her any more i don't hafta run and hide like a permanent sour- dough mixer but it took more courage to cross the yard about dusk when doreen ap- peared in the kitchen door than it had taken to put his saddle on dynamite that afternoon to his surprise she dis- played signs of confusion when he drew near and that added to his own courage that was a fine ride you made she said hurriedly thanks he replied hoping she could not hear the pounding of his heart that's my business--ridin and punchin cows--and i'm going to stick to it when i finish my month out there he gave a quick nod towards the cook house oh i should think you would doreen exclaimed recovering some- thing of her customary poise i couldn't imagine why you wanted to cook w-wanted to brady stammered reddening i didn't--i hated it but i had to get a job around here and that was the only one oh how funny she said the elusive smile curving her lips i had to stay around here because i saw you that morning in town and there wasn't no going away after i looked at you once suddenly doreen retreated a few steps what a nice compliment she remarked in attempted lightness won't you come in brady started to cross the threshold then halted he extended a hand to grasp one of hers no--i don't want to talk to you in any kitchen come out under the stars but i don't want-- yes you do brady insisted the expression in her eyes adding to his courage you do want to listen to me he drew her gently forward i heard you cheering me this afternoon when a girl cheers a hombre that way don't she like him a little bit of course doreen agreed readily making an attempt to release her hand but brady led her gently across the yard to the shadow of a box alder we were awfully proud to have someone on the double o ride dyna- mite she went on in rather a hurried tone and uncle jude-- mi-gosh brady gasped never mind dynamite and uncle jude i can't wait any longer to tell you-- the last words were inaudible because they were spoken against her lips and he didn't care if she did know how his heart was pounding--hers was doing the very same thing fire frenzy a romantic serial by  marie de nervaud part two synopsis kay crandon owner of the lazy nine ted gay nor who has lost his property through financial reverses josh hastings

the girl believes the man is straight therefore she offers him a job on the lazy nine and a cabin dwelling for his family presently tom runyon sees the brush stacked up nearby but kay manages to clear ted and herself of suspicion when the girl starts homeward she discovers smoke com- ing from the ranch buildings her place is on fire and upon her arrival she sees that nothing remains but the bunkhouse and a few cabins fortunately seth watson has been able to save a desk containing the ranch records and insurance papers there- upon josh hastings of the flying six offers his hospitality to the crandons kay refuses to accept it but her aunt kate and her sis- ter babs take advantage of his offer the next morning kay and ted ride to   ranch romances red river where kay learns from the

denounces hastings stating that he wants her land and insinuat- ing that he is the incendiary meanwhile un- known to kay ted quarrels with scrap johnson in kelly's saloon when the flying six puncher makes scathing remarks about kay in the ensuing fray ted threatens to kill johnson when kay relates her experience ted suggests that her punchers rebuild the ranch and start anew the loyal riders fall in with this plan and agree to work without salary until the ranch is on a paying basis again kay decides to ride to the flying six to recount the news to her aunt and sister when she leaves to see about purchasing some timberland in order to have sufficient lumber for the building she is waylaid on the trail by scrap johnson who is obviously on the same errand in behalf of hastings after pinioning her wrists and ankles and putting a gag in her mouth he leaves her and rides away chapter xii a successful bargain ted gaynor paused as he was saddling his horse to start on the long ride back to his home to ar- range for moving his mother and sister to their new quarters he glanced down toward kay's cabin and obeying a sudden impulse left his horse and walked quickly down to the tiny log house the door was locked so he knocked vigorously since he received no re- sponse he turned away and made for the bunkhouse on the run springing up the steps he nearly collided with seth as he pushed in the door and met him on his way out hullo seth exclaimed in surprise i thought you were on your way long ago something's got me worried ted explained i tried to find kay but she's off somewhere i saw her start out on flicker about a half hour ago seth answered what's on your mind i don't think she ought to let any grass grow under her feet before nail- ing that option ted declared as far as i can see that's the only available timber there is and we ought to make sure there's no slip-up hell's bells there can't be any slip- up seth ejaculated why old man warren'll be tickled pink to get rid of it just the same i'd be a lot easier to know that it was all sewed up ted looked from seth to two of the boys who had come up and were listening in have any of you fellows got any cash sure seth answered why because if we can scrape up twenty- five dollars or so i'll go in and make a first payment on the option in kay's name so there can't be any chance of her losing it i can't see as there's all that rush about it seth observed still and all there's no harm in getting that out of the way it would be kind of a nice surprise for kay to find it all attended to he pulled out a roll of bills and counted off seventeen dollars how about chipping in he cocked an eye at the other two who readily complied and between them they made up a pool of twenty- five dollars go to it son if you've got a hunch that way seth handed ted the money bring the option back and we'll give it to kay this evening i'll do that ted promised putting the wad of bills in his pocket i'll start off for home after supper on the way in to red river over the same route that kay and he had taken that morning ted's thoughts of kay were so absorbing that the time passed almost as quickly as it had in her actual company it seemed impossible that he had known the girl only about twenty- four hours the dramatic events that had followed in such rapid succession after their fateful meeting might have filled a year instead of a day so completely had he changed in the interval because of that meeting which might have had such a different ending if any- one but kay with her deep instinctive fire frenzy  understanding of human nature had found him at that act of desperation his whole outlook on life was changed just the relief of knowing that his moth- er and sister had a home to come to was enough to make a new man of him but added to that the thought that he was to be near kay helping her and planning for her opened up untold vis- tas of hopes that were too magic to be indulged in ted found old man warren's shack without any trouble he knocked on the door which was pulled open after a minute or two and he found him- self facing the grizzled old prospector who eyed him with suspicious sur- prise what do you want he demanded inhospitably i wanted to see you about buying some of that timberland that you hold on the south ridge of the bitter root ted answered having all he could do to keep from laughing aloud at the com- ical change that came over old man warren's fierce expression what's that he asked his face screwed up and his eyes squinted as though he doubted the evidence of his senses what'd you say ted repeated the purpose of his visit gosh halifax almighty his host opened the door wide and pulling ted in hastily closed it behind him i sure never thought i'd live to hear that you got any real money he blinked sus- piciously at his visitor i've twenty-five dollars to say i'm in earnest ted answered i'm offering you a hundred dollars for ten acres and an option on another ten at the same price and i'm ready to pay that twen- ty-five right now on deposit say young fella what's your game old man warren demanded you been prospectin up there ted laughed no that's out of my line i don't want it for myself he added frankly i'm buying it for kay crandon old man warren's suspicious little eyes screwed up still more what's she after started already to have a fling with her insurance money maybe ted gladly let his host put his own interpretation on kay's pur- pose the less he guessed kay's vital need for the property the better well if she wants it that bad strikes me she'll pay more now that she's got all that money to sling around the old prospector announced with cun- ning you tell her i ain't selling for a mite less than twenty dollars an acre ted turned carelessly toward the door no point telling her that he observed there's plenty of timberland to be bought at ten dollars an acre and even less i'll just pick it up somewhere else without bothering you any more kay thought you'd like to sell and told me to give you the first chance he pulled open the door so long hi there wait a minute you don't need to be in such a doggone rush i didn't say i wouldn't sell did i old man warren pulled him back have it your own way he capitulated then he added greedily where's that twen- ty-five bucks we'll get this down in black and white first ted sat down at the rough pine board table and drew up a memo- randum of the transaction which old man warren signed here you are ted said handing him the money he put the precious mem- orandum in his pocket smiling as he watched his host count the twenty-five dollars with loving care you're well rid of it he observed as he turned to the door again buyers aren't any too plentiful these days old man warren nodded impatiently but made no response as he started to count his unexpected wealth again with a so long that this time was ac- cepted ted went out and mounted his horse well satisfied with his afternoon's work going back at a more leisurely pace he was about five miles west of red river when he noticed far off in the  ranch romances distance a dark object that looked like someone on foot after he reined in he scanned the horizon to confirm his impression but he could see nothing telling himself that he was a victim of an optical illusion he dismissed the in- cident from his mind and pushed on to the lazy nine on arriving at the bunkhouse he found it deserted while he stood for a moment on the steps he turned over in his mind the question of waiting un- til someone came in off the range to deliver the document to kay for him or of just leaving it with a note for seth it was a great temptation to wait un- til kay came back and give it to her himself he could just see her eyes sparkle and her nose crinkle up with amusement when she heard of old man warren's attempt at bargaining on the other hand he ought to be starting for home as soon as possible as it was he'd have to ride all night before he ar- rived there debating this point in his mind he suddenly heard pounding hoofbeats and the next minute flicker came in sight riderless with his reins dragging and his ears back as he headed on a dead run for the corral with a fearful cer- tainty that something had happened to kay ted leaped down the bunkhouse steps and threw himself into the saddle of his waiting mount everything for- gotten but kay's safety a sudden flash of memory brought to mind that impression he had had of having seen someone on foot far to the north of him as he rode out from red river was it possible that kay had had the same hunch as his about the wisdom of seeing about the option at once and that she had ridden in to red river and had some accident hap- pened on the way cursing himself for not having inves- tigated then and there ted headed off at a hard gallop in the general direc- tion of the place where he had thought he had seen that figure for a fleeting moment chapter xiii rescue left to herself kay sank back and gave way for a moment to the weak dizzy feeling that closed over her through her half-conscious state she could hear the retreating hoofbeats of scrap johnson's horse grow dimmer and dimmer in the distance finally they died away and the unbroken stillness of the mesa deepened around her and seemed to be dragging her into its own oblivion fighting down the temptation to let go and sink back into it kay struggled into a sitting position and forced her- self to take stock of her desperate situa- tion her jaws ached cruelly under the tightly tied bandanna and her legs and arms were unbearably cramped from their forced confinement but bad as the physical pain and discomfort were her mental anguish was far worse she hadn't a doubt but that all her plans for rebuilding had come to noth- ing and worse than that it was prac- tically a foregone conclusion that josh hastings would eventually get the ranch for the first time kay admitted to herself that he was too powerful and unscrupulous for her to fight him suc- cessfully but even though her mind recognized this fact she found that hope still persisted as she desperately analyzed that hope she realized that it centered around ted gaynor somehow or other he might get around this last blow that she had so stupidly brought on herself despite her effort to thrust the thought of scrap johnson into the back- ground of her mind and to cling to the conviction that he wouldn't dare to do her any actual harm a shudder ran over kay at the thought of his return he had all the instincts of a bully and he had shown himself capable of sickening revenge for the wounds she had inflicted on his vanity her lips burned at the memory of his kiss and panic seized her as she realized how powerless she was in his hands fire frenzy  even if he didn't do her any actual harm she would never get over the in- dignity that he had imposed upon her she was galvanized to action by this desperate thought the ranch and every- thing else were forgotten in the surge of self-preservation that swept over her kay rolled over and struggled up to her knees the incline of the coulee behind her shut her off from a view of the range and ruined any chance of her discovery by any passer-by not that there was likely to be anyone but it was a hun- dred to one chance some way or other she must get up there and her courage revived with the prospect of an imme- diate objective to be obtained kay gazed piercingly about for some sharp stone on which she might saw through her bonds nothing was to be seen but small stones and pebbles scattered through the bunch grass of the mesa and kay's heart sank as this first hope proved vain resolving to get up in the open bonds or no bonds kay managed to edge pain- fully up the slope by using her elbows and knees to pull herself along the distance which could have been covered by a few strides on foot seemed endless when negotiated in this painful fashion but at last she reached the top and sank back faint with exhaustion opening her eyes she could see the range stretching out in its undulating waves to the horizon on the south and east while to the north and west the mountains rose to intercept its vast space there was not a sign of life in all the endless expanse in a kind of stupor kay watched the flickering waves of heat that made the air seem to vibrate against the blue sky a merciful ob- livion was stealing over her when sud- denly against the sky on the horizon to the south she saw outlined the sil- houette of a horseman the first sickening dread that it might be scrap johnson was superseded by the realization that he wouldn't be rid- ing so far to the south resolving that whoever the rider was she would rather trust herself to him than to scrap john- son kay took fresh courage strengthened by new hope she strug- gled to her knees gazing desperately at the distant apparition unless she could stand up there wasn't a chance that he could see her kay edged her way over to a smooth boulder at some little dis- tance from her then by bracing herself against it she managed to pull herself up on her feet as she wavered uncer- tainly on the one foot that was in a position to take a solid stand on the ground her heart gave a great leap and a strangled cry beat against the muf- fling bandanna she watched the horseman come to a standstill and although he was only a speck in the distance kay was con- vinced that he was gazing her way in an instinctive impulsive effort to jerk her arms up and signal to him she lost her balance and sank back to the ground straining and panting she tried again to get up her eyes never leaving the silhouetted figure with a groan of desperation she saw him resume his way after his disap- pearance her courage forsook her and she gave way to the rushing blackness that enveloped her sleeping beauty eh kay came to to realize that scrap johnson was standing over her she kept her eyes closed as she summoned all her courage to meet the ordeal ahead if she kept her wits about her there might yet be some way out there must be some decency in the man she could appeal to but she musn't show any fear he gave a low whistle i'll say you've done some traveling he ob- served kind of hard going what he stooped down and loosened her gag no point in covering up those red lips any longer he laughed mock- ingly as he straightened up again come on cutie i know you're sham- ming open up those brown eyes of yours i like to see em snap kay opened her eyes and looked --ranch romances--first sept  ranch romances straight at him without moving all her will-power was shining in their hyp- notic depths and in spite of himself scrap johnson gave an embarrassed laugh and took a backward step if you'll cut these bonds and ride away from here--kay's voice was low and intent as she held him with her gaze--i'll agree to keep still about what's happened that's your only chance to stay on this range and live for a moment he wavered then with a hoarse laugh he stooped down beside her and put his arm around her a bird in the hand's worth two in the bush he gloated breathing heavily his eyes avoided hers and focused on her lips and kay felt a sick rush of terror in their absorption neither had heard the thud of distant hoofbeats but now they both became aware of them drop- ping kay with an oath scrap johnson sprang to his feet and seized his gun in the same instant kay kicked out fiercely against his shins her bound feet catching him unawares and throwing him off his balance he crashed to the ground his gun exploding harmlessly in the air through the waves of blackness that assailed her kay heard the pounding of hoofs and ted gaynor's voice call- ing lie still if you move you're a goner galvanized to life again by the mira- cle of hearing ted's voice kay shrank away from the prone figure at her feet that suddenly ceased struggling at the deadly threat behind ted's command with her heart in her throat she turned and gazed at the oncoming figure of her rescuer chapter xiv an ultimatum taking in the situation at a glance ted pulled his mount to a sliding stop and slipped off his eyes fixed on scrap johnson whom he held covered with the gun kay had given him a foot or two away from him scrap john- son's gun lay where it had fallen just out of reach but dangerously near ted shifted his aim for one fraction of a second from scrap johnson and sent a shot that shattered the gun to bits then he covered the man on the ground again before he had a chance to move get out of his reach kay ted called without once taking his eyes off his victim i don't aim to have him try to use you as a shield without a word kay obeyed drag- ging herself well out of reach of scrap johnson in case he should try any such desperate maneuver now get up you it seemed to kay that she had never heard such controlled fury in any hu- man voice after a moment's hesita- tion the flying six puncher rose to his feet pitch em and keep em there with a snarl he obeyed and kay glanced fearfully from one man to the other what was to be the outcome of this encounter turn around ted's voice rang out again and as his prisoner obeyed he reached with his free hand for the rope on the pommel of his saddle stepping swiftly over to scrap john- son ted pressed his gun into his back at the same time putting a loop around his raised hands after he had jerked them down he expertly trussed john- son's arms to his sides then tripped him and finished the job of hogtying him ted left him where he had dropped and strode over to kay with quick clean cuts of his knife he severed the ropes that bound her are you all right his breath came quickly as he gazed with desperate anx- iety into kay's eyes she nodded a tremulous reassuring smile on her lips yes thanks to you ted handed her her father's gun that she had given him take this and if anything happens to me you can protect yourself but nothing will happen his voice still vibrated with the same deadly fury fire frenzy  what are you going to do kay demanded much as i'd like to i can't kill this cowardly coyote in cold blood if he hasn't harmed you and i'm not going to drag him to the sheriff to have this noised about the range so i'm going to give him a second lesson he won't forget and if he ever shows up on the range again i will kill him no--no kay cried in a terror- stricken voice leave him bound and let's go without appearing to hear her ted stepped swiftly away and called con- temptuously to scrap johnson that's only a slip noose get your- self free and come and take your les- son a look of mingled surprise and elation gleamed in scrap johnson's eyes as he strained against the ropes and felt them give shaking himself loose he crouched for a moment then made a rush for ted all the fury of his former defeat in the attack he launched at him it seemed to kay that it was hours instead of seconds that with her heart in her mouth she watched the struggle between the two men both were slight in build though scrap johnson had a decided advantage in weight and gen- eral physical fitness the outraged fury at the indignity that had been put on kay however added an invincible fury to ted's attack that far outweighed any mere physical advantage of the other sidestepping his opponent's fist- swinging rush ted came back at him with a blow that sent him staggering backwards when johnson recovered his balance he lowered his head with a roar of rage and butted it into ted's stomach like a battering ram but ted countered with a swinging uppercut that found its mark in spite of the pain- ful contraction of his muscles at the foul blow ted followed up his advantage like one possessed as he landed one punish- ing blow after another finally forcing his antagonist to his knees panting and blinking the sweat out of his eyes he drew back and as scrap johnson struggled to his feet and lunged for him ted planted a knockout blow on the man's chin that snapped his head back with a sickening twist with a groan he toppled to the ground and lay still kay let out a long quivering breath as ted stood panting for a moment then he walked over to her and took back the gun from her trembling hand it'll be some time before he comes to in spite of his effort to steady it his voice showed the effect of the emo- tional and physical ordeal he had just been through the sooner we get off the better unless i miss my guess he'll vamoose from this range without too much boasting about this after- noon's doings he slipped the gun in his holster and stepped over to scrap johnson's horse which was patiently waiting at some distance from the late fray his reins over his neck picking up the reins ted hung them over the pommel of the saddle then giving him a sharp blow on the flank he stampeded him off across the mesa that bird can walk it will do him good and work out his stiffness he observed grimly glancing at the uncon- scious figure on the ground as he came back to kay how about our getting under way ted -- wait kay's eyes were enormous with the force of an idea that she was struggling with that man has the option on our timberland right there in his pocket ted stared at her in bewilderment was her mind giving under the strain no he hasn't kay he soothed as he led his horse over to her i'll tell you about that on the way home but he has kay declared passion- ately gazing with a fascinated horror at the inert figure stretched on the mesa he got it by trickery and if you won't take it way from him i'm going to wait a minute ted seized both her hands in one of his as he fumbled with the other for a paper in his pocket  ranch romances no need for you to rifle his pockets he added flourishing it triumphantly before her with amazement kay ran her eyes over the memorandum of ted's trans- action with old man warren with the prospector's name signed at the bottom ted you mean you beat him to it her eyes sparkled with excitement and the color flooded her cheeks at this further evidence of ted's thought for her in a few words he told her about seth and the boys chipping in to raise enough to bind the purchase and about his visit to old man warren i don't know anything about beating this guy to it he added feasting his eyes on her happy excitement as she folded the precious paper and put it in her pocket you'll have to tell me that part of it come on a swift strong vibration ran all through him at the thought of holding kay in his arms as they rode back to the ranch mounting he reached down his hand and she sprang lightly up be- fore him her own heightened color at- testing to the fact that his emotion had communicated itself to her for a long time they rode in silence across the mesa that was beginning to take on the more intense colors and the lengthened shadows of late afternoon kay leaned confidingly against ted and his arm involuntarily tightened around her somehow there seemed to be no need for words and sweet as the gay companionship of the morning's ride had been this silent communion meant in- finitely more the sunset colors were flooding the sky as they neared the ranch house gate abruptly ted reined in i'd like to say good-by to you here i must be on my way he hardly recognized his low husky voice a wild longing to kiss kay before he released her swept over him but even as he struggled with it kay slipped from his arm and sprang lightly to the ground when will you be back kay's voice was as low and vibrant with sup- pressed feeling as his three days at the most he an- swered for a long moment he gazed at her he started to say something then changed his mind and picked up the reins good-by he wheeled abruptly and kay watched him ride into the sun- set a strange premonition suddenly tightened her throat would he really be back in three days already their whole tense and dramatic encounter seemed like a dream turning swiftly she walked past the charred ruins of the ranch house and down to her cabin skirting the bunk- house in a desire to be alone for a few minutes before accounting for her ab- sence to the boys chapter xv an unexpected visitor absorbed in her thoughts kay walked swiftly down to the cabin her eyes absently-mindedly fixed on the browning bunch grass at her feet hullo there you are a hearty voice startled her out of her reverie as she glanced up she saw the tall figure of a man waiting for her on the cabin steps reluctantly relin- quishing her hope for solitude she hur- ried forward and recognized tom run- yon as the waiting figure say i couldn't wait any longer to come over and tell you how bad i feel about all this he waved toward the ruins of the ranch house as he came down the steps to meet her his eyes as they rested on her brilliant coloring and the flush still in her cheeks from the ride with ted expressed the same admiration they had on the ridge i had to stick around up yonder until i was relieved he explained or i'd have been over sooner that's very good of you kay slipped her hand out of his grasp i certainly didn't think when i talked to you last that i'd find my own house burnt down fire frenzy  i kind of thought i might be some help tom runyon boomed pomp- ously i've been talking with that fore- man of yours up at the bunkhouse and it looks mighty peculiar to me how this fire started kay shot him a startled look you mean you think-- i'm not thinking anything he has- tened to say with a cautious lowering of his voice i'm only saying that this and any other fire will bear investigat- ing kay felt all her first suspicions revive but she remembered dan steele's warn- ing and held her peace while this tom runyon seemed all right and a kindly and genial enough person she didn't really know anything about him so it would pay to go slow if on the other hand he wanted to go ahead investigating on his own in- itiative he might unearth something that would give some foundation for her suspicion of josh hastings but while she must be very careful not to voice the direction in which her suspicions lay there was one point on which she must set him straight right away i am absolutely certain that seth and our outfit are above suspicion she stated positively so if you're looking for foul play you can count them out from the start maybe he nodded his approval of her loyalty but when you're starting out to look for clues you can't be handi- capped by any foregone conclusions you just leave the investigating to me he added tolerantly all i want you to do is to answer a few questions gladly but let's wait until after sup- per kay leaned against the side of the cabin for a second overcome by a sudden weary faintness tom runyon sprang to put a steady- ing hand on her arm what's the mat- ter he inquired anxiously you look all in nothing kay straightened up and smiled at him i'm just a little tired i guess i'll be all right as soon as i get something to eat you go on up to the bunkhouse and i'll join you in a minute i'm eating with the boys un- til i can get my own housekeeping ar- rangements rigged up you'll stay for supper of course she added as he hesitated a moment that's mighty good of you i'd be glad to only look here who was that you were riding in with kay paused at the cabin door her eye- brows raised in surprise a slight flush came into her cheeks as she answered his question after all there was no point in making a mystery about being with ted that was ted gaynor the man i was with up on the ridge she answered to her annoyance she flushed still more as she caught tom runyon's keen speculative look at her heightened color oh yes well he's just the one i wanted to ask you about but we'll wait until after supper before kay could answer he turned and made for the bunkhouse as kay washed her face and hands she tried to reason herself out of the queer panicky feeling that suddenly took possession of her the dark pre- monition that she had had when she said good-by to ted swept over her again don't be a fool she scolded her image in the mirror as she ruthlessly tugged a comb through her tangled curls you're just letting your nerves run away with you what could pos- sibly happen to him you must keep your head and don't let tom runyon's first suspicions start up again braced up by the thought that it was up to her to protect ted kay walked slowly up to the bunkhouse planning in her mind just what she was going to say any thoughts were welcome as long as they pushed into the background her horrible experience of the afternoon instead of allowing herself to dwell on that she concentrated on the memory of the magnificent way ted had come to the rescue if her first intuitive judgment of him in spite of the damning conditions of  ranch romances their first meeting had needed any bol- stering up she certainly had had it there from the minute he had been freed from the desperate need of providing for his mother and sister ted had been a changed man kay thought back to what he had said in that first dramatic moment when she had held him covered with her gun with her intuitive sym- pathy she understood exactly how des- peration for those he loved had driven him to feel justified in destroying some timber for the sake of saving human lives even in his desperation he had thought it all out with the same intelli- gent conciseness that he had used in planning a way out for her and follow- ing up by saving the timberland that she had so nearly lost by her own folly he had been perfectly right in saying that in burning off the ridge he had chosen he would have done no actual damage to anyone it would have de- stroyed a second scrub growth of tim- ber but it could easily have been kept under control you couldn't expect any man to see it as she did though kay realized as she neared the bunkhouse and saw tom runyon standing talking with seth while they waited for the call to sup- per especially not a man of tom run- yon's type who was obsessed with the idea of his own importance and would be ready to jump to any conclusion that would reflect glory on himself and the demand of the community for some action in running down the firebug whoever he was would make runyon all the more eager to pin the blame for all the fires on ted if he suspected that one mad act of his from the consequences of which thank good- ness she had arrived in time to save him the supper bell rang just as kay joined the two men and in the general conversation at the table there was no chance for runyon to ask her the ques- tions she was prepared to parry as skil- fully as she could talk turned on the new scheme for building the ranch house and everyone was full of ideas and suggestions by the way seth broke in suddenly isn't it about time ted gaynor was getting back oh i meant to tell you and i for- got kay felt tom runyon's eyes on her as she turned apologetically to seth i--i met him on the mesa and he gave me the option he got from old man warren it was terribly good of you and the boys to lend that money so he could clinch the bargain she smiled at them a sudden catch in her throat and mist in her eyes at this proof of their loyalty to her why didn't he come in seth de- manded i wanted to get all the dope he thought he'd better be getting on again kay felt the slow color come into her cheeks at the insistence of tom runyon's look he told me to tell you all about it she launched into the account ted had given her of his interview with old man warren in the hopes of diverting attention from her- self i like that gaynor fellow seth ob- served when she had finished just where did you say you picked him up kay gave a gasp at this break it was evident that seth had forgotten all the things she had told him to say to tom runyon about ted and he couldn't have put his foot in it any worse if he had deliberately tried than by this question she could see tom runyon's ears pricked up to catch her answer al- though he pretended to be engrossed in conversation with one of the boys managing to change her gasp into a cough kay fixed her eyes firmly on seth as she answered why i've told you about him before seth you don't pay attention to what i say half the time under her teasing tone her voice held a significant reminder he's the one who has been helping me decide on some of the timberland i've been want- ing to buy even before the house burned down she turned to tom runyon with a fire frenzy  politely explanatory air as she said i've been thinking we ought to add some more timberland to the ranch there's nothing much but scrub growth on that ridge where i met you he observed that's just the conclusion ted ar- rived at kay looked up at tom run- yon with flattering admiration i'm sorry he isn't here you and he would enjoy talking together where's he gone just yesterday he decided to really join up with the outfit kay explained and he's gone back to bring his mother and sister to the other little cabin like mine i see tom runyon's looks belied his words kay realized nervously as his black eyes fastened themselves specula- tively on her he's the one who has got us started with this idea of building the ranch house and barn ourselves she rattled on so it's lucky he is a regular mem- ber of the outfit now sure is seth agreed heartily push- ing back his chair and rising to his feet we'll need all the hands we can get on this job there was a rattle and creaking of chairs as the others followed suit how about taking me on- tom runyon suggested with a flattering eye bent on kay you're too valuable right where you are she countered gayly i'm count- ing on you to keep my new timberland from burning down that's right tom runyon promptly succumbed to kay's flattery and with a relieved feeling that she had safely steered him away from the dan- gerous interest he was manifesting in ted kay sauntered out into the twi- light with him her relief however was short-lived no sooner had they stepped out of the mess shack than tom runyon took pos- sessive hold of her arm saying how about that little talk we were going to have all right said kay resignedly as she allowed herself to be guided down to the cabin chapter xvi strange news marshaling her wits to meet the coming interview kay walked the short distance from the bunkhouse to the cabin in silence she felt that she would give anything to be rid of tom runyon and have a chance to rest after her momentous and ex- hausting day but some instinct warned her that it would be foolish to let him go away with the suspicion that she could see he still harbored against ted tired as she was she would have to change his line of thought or he might make trouble shall we sit out here kay sank down on the top step and leaned back against the post that held the rail of the tiny porch in place sure kay couldn't quite read the look in tom runyon's dark eyes as he gazed at her her thoughts suddenly flew to those luminous black eyes of ted's so different from the ones bent on her now ted's eyes had a light that seemed to come from within while tom's were just black and round and staring but no whit less intent you make some picture there do you know it said tom fervently kay smiled a faint response to his admiration i don't feel much like a picture she admitted i'm terribly tired i'll bet you are he put one foot on the lower step and leaned toward her his elbow resting on his knee i'm not going to keep you but i just want to get one or two things straightened out in my mind just how long have you known this ted gaynor goodness i never can remember dates but it seems as though i'd known him for ages on the other hand i feel as though i'd known you quite a long time and we met only yesterday kay glanced up at him from under her  ranch romances dark lashes with deliberate coquetry i certainly feel that way about you tom runyon gave a flattered laugh adding say what is it about you that keeps a fellow looking at you and forgetting what he wants to say kay laughed why say anything she asked demurely it's too lovely here in the twilight to be asking ques- tions i know what i would like to have you tell me though she added as an afterthought what he was all eager attention tell me something about your work as fire patrol have you done it before you came here sure i have he cleared his throat with a pleased air of superiority that's why the protective association sent for me to come up here and see if i couldn't get to the bottom of these mysterious fires i've been handling a situation a whole lot like this in wyoming and be- lieve me i ran that firebug to earth tell me about it kay fixed him with her eyes full of a flattering inquiry well it was this way tom runyon settled back and kay was just breath- ing a sigh of relief at having success- fully side-tracked him from the subject of ted gaynor when he leaned forward once more and broke in abruptly on his narrative before i get going on that i want to clear up my mind about this gay- nor guy he looked keenly at kay did he tell you about the fight he had today kay looked at him with startled eyes how could tom runyon possibly have found out about the fight on the mesa fight she echoed in a faint tone so he didn't tell you tom ex- claimed i had a hunch he wouldn't kay looked at him with startled eyes amazement what under the sun was he driving at if tom runyon knew about the fight at all he must know that she had been there and had seen the whole thing but there was no pos- sible way for him to know he had come to the ranch from the opposite direction so he couldn't have come across scrap johnson when the puncher came to and have heard about it from him i don't understand what you're talk- ing about kay said finally are you sure he was in a fight sure as shooting tom runyon as- sured her the guy that came out to relieve me saw the whole thing but he couldn't have kay burst out then hastily tried to cover up her break i mean he must be mixing ted up with someone else not on your life he wasn't tom declared positively he was right there in kelly's joint when it happened kelly's joint kay echoed in a re- lieved tone as a light suddenly burst on her oh that wasn't ted he was waiting for me outside the bank and i remember now he did say some- thing about having seen a fracas of some kind down at kelly's seen it tom scoffed i'll say he saw it he was the one who started it but--how--why-- kay bit her lip and broke off short the last thing she wanted to do was to discuss ted and she still felt sure that tom runyon was mistaken that's just what i mean tom leaned forward and shook his finger im- pressively at her there's a lot you don't know about that gaynor guy tom runyon was so positive that kay felt it would be better to sift this rumor to the bottom he was fighting with a fellow named scrap johnson about some girl or other tom answered i reckon that's why he wasn't so keen about mention- ing it to you his tone had a malicious edge but kay hardly heard it her mind was flashing back to the events of the morn- ing it might have been possible while she had been in the bank for this thing to have happened she had been so pre- occupied with her own troubles when she came out of the bank that she had not noticed ted particularly she suddenly remembered something fire frenzy  ted had said when he had announced on the mesa that he meant to fight scrap johnson he had said he was going to give him a second lesson kay- had noticed this remark at the time with a wondering conjecture but in the fast-moving events afterwards she had forgotten it yeah the two of em had it out hot and heavy kay suddenly came back to the present and tom's droning voice as he recounted the event the way it had been told to him everybody thought this scrap fellow was going to lick the stuffing out of him but gaynor got him down by a trick twist then he threatened he'd kill him if he ever heard him mention his girl's name again tom paused to let this piece of infor- mation sink in his eyes never leaving kay's face as he watched her reaction to this unexpected news feeling his gaze on her kay steeled herself to hide her surprise and confu- sion it seemed impossible with all that had passed between them since that ted shouldn't have mentioned it to her the only conclusion to be drawn was that he had kept still because he hadn't wanted her to know that he had been fighting about some girl pride came to kay's aid and helped her to conceal the hurt feeling that ted's lack of con- fidence gave her there was no reason why he should have mentioned it if he didn't want to she observed lightly perhaps as long as he won out he might have thought it would have seemed like boasting he probably won't mind boasting about it to the black-haired beauty he was fighting for tom chuckled as he scanned kay's expression for her re- action to this remark black-haired how do you know she was black-haired the involuntary question burst out before kay could stop it because scrap johnson had said something about a black-haired filly tom runyon went on deliberately giv- ing a garbled account of the information he had received his eyes narrowing as he observed the flush that spread over kay's cheek that's what started the fight he finished well he evidently had his reasons for not mentioning it kay tried to speak lightly and indifferently but something seemed suddenly to give way inside her so that she felt she couldn't possibly go on with this conversation whatever the consequences of uncere- moniously dismissing tom runyon she simply had to be alone she abruptly stood up and held out her hand i'm afraid i'll have to say good night with the greatest effort of will kay kept her voice from trembling i've had a strenuous day and i guess i haven't entirely got over the shock of yesterday poor little girl tom runyon's voice was a trifle over-sympathetic as he took her hand in both of his and bent his face close to her you go and get a good sleep and any time you need any help you call on tom runyon just you forget about this investigating business leave that all to me thanks kay murmured smiling faintly at him as she drew her hand away i hope you'll come over any time you feel like it trust me tom runyon boomed heartily then he added with heavy gallantry you're going to be seeing a whole lot of me young lady and don't you forget it feeling her powers of resistance grad- ually giving way to the weak dizzy sen- sation that was overcoming her kay turned without further ceremony and bolted into her cabin with a half smile of satisfaction on his lips tom runyon strode off to the bunkhouse chapter xvii turning the tables it was a good half hour after kay and ted had left him on the mesa be- fore scrap johnson came back to con- sciousness stirring painfully he tried  ranch romances to sit up then fell back as he felt him- self constrained by the ropes that bound him he swore to himself while he strained against his bonds and gave a snarl of satisfaction as he felt them give slightly alternately resting and work- ing to loosen the knots in the rope he finally cleared himself and staggered to his feet his jaws aching and his face ugly with rage he slowly started back to the flying six on foot he had not gone far when he saw a cloud of dust in the distance and emerging from it the fig- ure of a horseman coming towards him at a full gallop his jaw set as he rec- ognized josh hastings and his hand made an instinctive grab for his gun a savage oath burst out as he encoun- tered the empty holster scrap had no illusions as to the recep- tion he would get from his boss failure was the one thing for which josh hast- ings had no patience or sympathy and his fiery temper when he was thwarted was something to reckon with what's the meaning of this josh plastings pulled his plunging mount to a sliding halt as he came abreast of the plodding puncher where's your cay- use and where's that option i sent you to get resentment flared into scrap john- son's eyes and in his reckless mood and rage it was well for josh hastings that his holster was empty you were too damn slow scrap johnson snarled they beat you to it a dark flush came over josh hast- ings florid face and he ripped out an oath you mean you let kay crandon get there ahead of you sure i didn't scrap answered sul- lenly i stopped her all right but when i got to old man warren i found one of her punchers a guy named gay- nor had got there ahead of me and bought up the ridge you wanted and an option on the rest hastings exploded into a string of oaths the foxy little filly he raged then broke off short and looked keenly at scrap what do you mean about stopping her where is she a reckless disregard of consequences suddenly possessed scrap he was slated to be fired anyway so he might as well get all the revenge he could wouldn't you like to know he jeered i've beaten you to it with those red lips anyway and believe me they ain't waiting around for you that same gaynor guy came up and caught me off guard damn him but i'll get even yet he gave a wild in- coherent laugh at hastings expression some rival you've got there he ended and is she sweet on him oh boy shut up you drunken fool josh hastings reached over and grabbed johnson's shoulder with an iron grip give me this whole thing straight you've got the whole thing straight enough scrap wrenched himself away i'm resigning from your outfit anyway here and now resigning like hell josh hastings roared you're fired and the quicker you vamoose from this range the bet- ter this don't seem to be my popular day scrap johnson swaggered inso- lently your sweetheart's boy friend threatened to kill me the next time he saw me maybe you can figure why he taunted a look of cunning flashed into his face at an idea that suddenly struck him and he reeled over close to josh hastings mount where his eye had caught sight of a gun in the saddle pocket before josh hastings could recover from his renewed conviction that he was dealing with a drunken man scrap had grabbed the gun and covered him with a lightning draw hist em there was nothing drunk about scrap's tone now and josh hast- ings dropped his reins and reluctantly obeyed seein as how i'm through with this range anyway i'll make my exit in style scrap sneered suppose you fire frenzy  unfasten that belt of yours and toss it over here you'll pay for this good and plenty josh hastings raged as he obeyed i'm not sticking around to make any payments scrap observed he stooped to pick up the belt with its holster and gun attached with his left hand never taking his eyes from josh hastings however or shifting his aim hooking the belt over his arm scrap reached over and grabbed the bridle of his victim's mount get down he ordered his gun un- erringly trained on his former boss now vamoose yourself he ended ferociously when this last command had been obeyed you can have that hike back instead of me as josh hastings hesitated scrap shifted his aim the fraction of an inch and fired a shot that nipped the brim of his victim's stetson thus sending it spinning to the ground without waiting for a further re- minder josh hastings turned away and headed for the flying six spluttering with inarticulate rage after watching him for a second scrap johnson swung into the saddle and headed at a gallop for the distant blue ridges of the bitter root mountains chapter xviii a gruesome discovery by the time josh hastings reached home his rage was no longer in- articulate but it was none the less in- tense in the two hours during which he had indulged in the unaccustomed exercise of trudging painfully across tho hard sun-baked surface of the range he had had plenty of time to face the bitter truth that he had been made a fool of not only by his former cowhand but by kay crandon as well just when he had seemingly had everything in his own hands the tables had been turned and he was now ap- parently farther than ever from accom- plishing his ends the appearance of ted gaynor on the scene particularly enraged him and the taunting hints that scrap johnson had thrown out about his being kay's boy friend made him see red the thought of any rival was intoler- able but the idea that the man whom he believed he had put down once and for all in the past should come back to challenge him was an added outrage with this thought and fury at scrap johnson alternately uppermost in his mind josh hastings found himself cherishing two distinct plans of re- venge first of all he meant to make his former puncher pay through the nose for his insolence and his plan here was definite and drastic although it had to be handled with care he had no idea of telling the whole story of his plight and being the laughing stock of the range so this prevented him from call- ing the sheriff to his aid and following scrap johnson up with a posse he had a hunch that scrap was headed for the idaho state line and that he planned to make his getaway over the only pass that led over the bitter root from this region if he followed right after him there was a good chance of overtaking him scrap johnson would be pretty sure to figure that his one-time boss would rather lose his mount and call it quits on the situation than let the story leak out of the fix his cowhand had landed him in therefore he wouldn't feel pressed for time and it would be a fairly easy matter to catch up with him and there won't be any doubt about who'll have the drop this time josh hastings thought voiced itself aloud with a malignant intensity of tone that boded ill for scrap johnson when that moment should come he stooped down to ease the heel of his boot then limped along with a groan he'll pay for that damn blister too he muttered savagely as he forged ahead his eyes squinting into the dis- tance for a glimpse of the scattered buildings of the flying six  ranch romances finally they loomed in sight and josh hastings slowed up as he planned his campaign of action then regard- less of his blistered feet he broke into a run for a nearby coulee he had no time to lose if he were going to make the lower corral and get a horse with- out being seen when he had left the ranch to follow scrap johnson he had announced that he might spend the night in town so no one was expecting him right now the boys would be either in the mess shack or gathered around waiting for the supper call so here was his chance for a safe getaway following the coulee he came at last to the lower corral which was hidden from the ranch buildings and a good three hundred yards distant from the upper corral there he roped himself a horse quickly saddled him and rode back through the coulee which shel- tered him from view giving the ranch house a wide berth he headed off for the mountains at a run it was over an hour later when hast- ings reached the trail that eventually led to the pass across the divide the last streams of color from the afterglow of the sunset were fading into light pinks and lavenders and twilight was well under way as he started up the climb between the living walls of pines only the faintest light penetrated through the thick branches that interlaced overhead but josh hastings pushed on his lust for re- venge still strong upon him there would be a moon later to guide him through the pass in the sad- dle of the divide's defile if he had not overtaken his victim by that time but he figured on coming upon him before he reached the central divide urging his horse on he finally emerged from the heavily timbered slope of the east- ern divide he topped the ridge and plunged down to the shallow valley that lay between it and the central divide after he quickly crossed the valley josh hastings rode his mount on up the scantily timbered slope the light of the rising moon gradually spread over the whole landscape and by the time hastings reached the crest of the pass it was high in the heavens just beyond the saddle of rock was a small grassy plateau which harbored the spring-fed stream from whose mys- terious depths water flowed in both directions part seeking the bitter root river in montana and part flow- ing to the clear water river in idaho as hastings neared this strange spot his mount plunged restively and in- stead of making for the inviting water that gleamed ahead in the moonlight he balked and tried to whirl back and head through the pass again steady- ing him and driving on with a sharp cut of his quirt josh hastings reached the small grassy meadow that bordered the stream as he peered ahead through the moonlight he made out a strange hunched form lying by the edge of the water he swung his mount sharply at right angles and headed him away from his gruesome discovery dis- mounting at some little distance he came back on foot to investigate a baf- fled sense of rage rising in him at the thought of being cheated of his re- venge when he turned the inert figure over he let out a startled oath as he gazed at the deadly white face thus exposed to the moonlight instead of the pinched features of scrap johnson that he had expected to see the still face of ted gaynor in its frame of glossy black hair stared up at him chapter xix revenge recoiling in the first surprise of finding his other enemy so unex- pectedly delivered into his hands josh hastings stared back at the seemingly dead face for a long moment then he dropped on his knees and felt ted's heart a grunt of disappointment escaped fire frenzy  him as he detected a faint beat but after examining the wound that gaped in the fallen man's chest a grim smile of satisfaction flickered for a moment on his lips reckon a good enough job's been done on you after all he observed callously as he rose to his feet and stooped down to pull some grass to wipe the blood off his hands scrap johnson's saved me some trouble there all right he scanned the ground carefully walking back and forth in an ever wid- ening semi-circle around the wounded man looks like he got a shot from ambush he mused aloud as he failed to find any traces of footprints or trampled grass hello what's this he stopped short and bent down to examine a large flat stone that harbored a strange dark spot on its rough gray surface josh hastings experimentally stuck his finger on it and exploded into an oath as he pulled it back covered with a sticky red stain begins to look more like a duel he leaned down close and found sev- eral more dark spots leading away from the stone following them he came to some trampled grass and with growing excitement he followed in the tracks after going fifty feet or so he came at last on the object of his search a dark form lay in the underbrush by the edge of the grassy spot and this time as josh hastings leaned close to identify this second victim he saw the man he had expected to find in the first place a brief examination showed him to be far less seriously wounded than ted gaynor he had evidently fainted from loss of blood from a flesh wound in his arm but his pulse and his heart were strong an ugly look twisted josh hastings mouth as he stood looking down at the man he had pursued with such ruthless intent for vengeance a cunning gleam came into his eyes as he glanced back to where ted gaynor lay it was easy enough to reconstruct what had happened scrap johnson had undoubtedly won the draw and fired first and gaynor's shot had gone wild first catching by chance the fleshy part of johnson's arm there wasn't a doubt in josh hast- ings mind that ted gaynor was done for but just in case he might by some miracle pull through why not frame him so that suspicion of what josh was about to do would be forever pinned on this enemy of his he now had the chance to fix things so that no question would ever be raised about how scrap johnson met his end dead or alive ted gaynor would be held responsible working his dastardly plot out step by step josh hastings took off his bandanna and wrapped it carefully about his hand then he went swiftly back to where ted gaynor lay he bent down and loosened the fin- gers of the hand that still gripped the gun that kay had given to ted hold- ing it with the bandanna so that no touch of incriminating fingerprints could get on it josh hastings slowly drew it from the loosened grip suddenly and without any warning he felt ted's dark eyes on him then as suddenly again the lids dropped and the body he was bending over was as inert and lifeless as before doubting the evidence of his own senses but with his heart pounding suffocatingly in his ears at the memory of that strangely seeing look from those dark eyes josh hastings held himself rigidly still the weird beauty of the scene was lost on him but something of the eerie quality of that mysterious spot from which waters eventually flowed to the atlantic and the pacific made his breath come quicker and raised a momentary panic in him as he stared at ted gay- nor's white face he watched for any further sign of life but it lay still as death in the moonlight hastings breath came more normally again while he was cursing himself for a fool he lifted up ted's gun and walked halfway back toward scrap  ranch romances johnson where he took careful aim and fired the shot reverberated from the rocky walls of the pass behind him in- tensified by the silence so that it sounded like the blast of a cannon there was a convulsive jerk of scrap johnson's body and a dark spot appeared in his temple and slowly spread ted gaynor lay as before completely remote from this scene of violence he seemed as dead as the man who had just been murdered dropping the gun from which he had fired the fatal shot josh hastings knelt down and deliberately crawled back to the spot where ted gaynor lay hastings rose to his feet and looked back critically over the trail he had beaten through the grass he could see ted's gun gleaming where he had let it fall and a cruel smile twisted his lips dead or alive he had framed ted gay- nor whoever found the two bodies could not escape the inference of that dropped gun at one stroke he had been able not only to get his revenge on scrap but to wipe ted gaynor from his path no matter what kay might have thought of ted she was not the kind to let her thoughts linger over a proved murderer from now on the way with kay should be clear sailing walking slowly over to his horse josh hastings swung into the saddle and headed back toward the pass chapter xx shelter the moon hung low in the western sky and moonlight and dawn were mingled in a cold gray light before ted gaynor opened his eyes again for a long interval he lay staring straight ahead his eyes darkened with pain gradually the gentle trickle of the water penetrated to his consciousness and he was suddenly aware of his burning throat and the fever that blazed through him he tried to pull himself over to the water but fell back with a groan at the intolerable pain in his chest a wild look came into his eyes and he mut- tered incoherently slumping down again by the water that was so near and yet so far he seemed on the point of giving up finally with a mighty ef- fort he roused himself and rolled over so that he could reach the edge of the stream as he sucked in a great gulp of the life-giving drink ted's mind cleared for a moment and he realized where he was and what had happened in his third en- counter with scrap johnson on his way over to the clear water basin he had dismounted to get a drink at the head- waters of the pass and just as he was in the act of quenching his thirst he heard a rasping challenge behind him whirling about and drawing at the same time he had seen scrap johnson a short distance away the next instant there had been the roar and blaze of two guns but scrap johnson's bullet reached its mark first while ted's went wild from that point memory registered nothing but a blank void shot through with intolerable pain and nightmare dreams doubtless scrap johnson had ridden on and left him to die all details of the night blurred into delirium as the pain in his chest swept over him again but although the de- lirium persisted he did not lose con- sciousness through it all ran a sub- conscious will to live a determination to pull through for kay's sake she needed him he mustn't fail her by a gigantic efforts and propelled by this inner insistent force ted pulled himself up on his hands and knees and began slowly and painfully to drag himself along the edge of the stream two thoughts possessed him above all others he mustn't lose the trail of the water he must stay by it so that he could quench the thirst that burned in him and he mustn't let himself re- lax and lie down once he did that he would never get up again gradually the dawn lightened and when the first rays of the sun glistened fire frenzy  on the headwaters of the bitter root and clear water rivers ted had man- aged to drag himself five hundred yards or more through the scrub pines that dotted the southeastern slope of the divide at the point of exhaustion but still pushed on by that mysterious will to live that functioned without any con- scious control he pushed on to a small clearing that appeared unexpectedly through the trees at the far end of it was a tumbled- down and apparently deserted shack making for it in a blind instinct to reach shelter ted struggled over to this goal muttering in incoherent delirium as he approached there was a slight movement behind the shuttered win- dow and the next minute a figure ap- peared in the broken-down doorway for a terrified second the girl in the doorway and the exhausted and delir- ious man stared at each other the girl clutched the sagging wooden frame of the door her brown eyes wide and her dark hair in sharp contrast to her face which showed up without an ounce of color in her startled surprise of the moment the amazement in her look gradually changed to concern as she took in ted's desperate plight and with a cry of pity she ran over to him and stooped down to try to help him with a convulsive effort ted struggled to straighten up but he immediately sank back uncon- scious her first terrified surprise over the girl proved herself equal to the emer- gency facing her she could not have been more than eighteen but she had a wiry strength in her tall slender frame half carrying half dragging ted she managed to get him to the door of the shack the early morning sun had gradually become obscured by dark clouds that piled up in the east and threatened a sudden downpour after one glance at the lowering sky the girl darted inside the tiny enclosure and quickly made up the cot on which she had evidently spent the night then with one last mighty effort she pulled ted inside and managed to lift him onto the cot just as the first heavy drops of the storm splashed on the roof panting from her exertion she leaned back a moment against the wall and studied the face of the man she had brought in evidently reassured by what she saw she dropped to her knees with a murmur of pity and expertly ex- amined his wound the girl rose to her feet and took a basin which she filled with water pulling a clean cloth out from the drawer of a rude wash- stand in one corner she deftly proceeded to wash ted's wound the rain gathering with the swift in- tensity of mountain storms beat a wild tattoo on the roof and gusts of wind shook the tiny shelter to its founda- tions however the girl was oblivious to the outside elements as she bent with absorbed attention to her battle with death chapter xxi waiting kay waked up with a start as a ray of the early morning sun slanted through her cabin window and shone insistently in her eyes thank goodness the sun's out at last she glanced out the window then snuggled down in bed again to indulge in a few moments of tempting day dreams it was the third day since ted had left and kay planned with happy ex- citement the way she would greet him when he arrived with his mother and sister she had recovered from her hurt feeling at the news tom runyon had brought of ted's first fight with scrap johnson whatever reasons he had had for not telling her she was going to give him the benefit of the doubt and wait until he was ready to tell her kay smiled drowsily to herself one thing she was sure of he hadn't been thinking of any dark-haired girl when he had said good-by to her and some- how she knew that he wasn't going to  ranch romances waste any time getting back to her during the storm that had raged for the last two days kay had busied her- self getting the extra cabin ready for ted's mother and sister it had been furnished in a rough sort of way and by picking out odds and ends from the bunkhouse and using some of the few things that had been saved from the fire kay had contrived to make it quite home-like babs had ridden over once in the downpour to report that all was well at the flying six and that aunt kate and she were in no hurry to leave their pres- ent quarters a frown puckered kay's forehead as her thoughts shifted from ted to the situation at the flying six it was galling to be accepting josh hastings hospitality for members of her family even if she wasn't accepting it for herself she hadn't seen him since that visit when she had told him of her plans with such near-disastrous consequences one good thing at least had come out of it she had positive proof now that josh hastings was working against her the doubtful point was whether or not he knew that she was aware of his ef- forts to get the timberland away from her unless scrap johnson had gone back and reported what had happened josh hastings would have no way of know- ing whether or not kay had known of his plot and kay had a hunch that scrap johnson wouldn't be any too eager to describe that afternoon's events to his boss he would be much more likely to realize that his usefulness on this range was over and to clear out without any embarrassing expla- nations in that case at least while aunt kate and babs were under his roof it would be best to pretend ignorance of josh hastings real attitude toward her also it would be easier to keep her eye on him if she didn't let matters come to an open break jumping out of bed with a sudden desire to express her excited an- ticipation by action kay hurriedly dressed and ran up to the mess shack for breakfast ted and his family probably wouldn't arrive before noon anyway but there was still a number of finishing touches that she wanted to put on the cabin giving an involuntary skip of sheer joy of living at the beauty of the morning kay drew in a long breath of the in- vigorating air after the two-day down- pour everything was so fresh and glis- tening that it must be a good omen the morning flew past and by noon kay had the cabin completely finished and shining brightly for its new occu- pants she had a guilty feeling that she should have ridden over to see aunt kate instead of devoting her whole morning to the pleasant excitement of getting ready for ted but she eased her conscience by the thought that she would go over after the arrival of the newcomers so that she could tell aunt kate all about them all during lunch kay had an ear out for the pounding of hoofs and the rattle of the livery buckboard from red river but the quiet of the mesa was undis- turbed the afternoon wore on and by four o'clock kay found herself nervous and irritable with disappointment if she waited any longer it would be too late to ride over to see aunt kate and she'd never hear the end of it if she let all of the day go past without seeing her on the other hand she'd be sure to miss ted if she started off now art- lessly persuading herself that it would be very rude not to be there to greet ted's mother and sister and that see- ing ted himself had nothing to do with it kay hung around finally at six o'clock when the mesa bell clanged out kay reluctantly ad- mitted that they weren't going to arrive that day at supper she was silent and abstracted dwelling in her thoughts rather than in the conversation going on about her suddenly she was aware that seth was speaking to her what did you say seth she came to with a start fire frenzy  gosh you must be getting deaf seth grumbled i've been asking you about six times when you expected gay- nor back i thought it was today it was kay answered but some- thing must have happened to delay him i'm sure he'll be here tomorrow here's hoping seth growled we can't let any grass grow under our feet getting that barn started i'm going to start cutting timber tomorrow whether he's back or not he'll be here kay predicted confi- dently she paused a moment at the door of the shack and looked out isn't it great after the rain i'll say it is seth agreed the equinox must have got kind of mixed up this year to give us that storm so early but i ain't kicking none makes the danger of fire just that much less kay nodded absent-mindedly to this remark then she sauntered down to the corral and whistled flicker to her obeying a sudden impulse she got him out and saddled him after she had rid- den up to her cabin for her sweater she headed out onto the mesa deciding to kill two birds with one stone and ride the restlessness out of her system by going over to see aunt kate kay started off for the flying six at a brisk gait it would be moonlight by nine o'clock she reflected and she could easily be back by eleven if she didn't go now she'd simply have to go tomorrow and then she'd miss being there when ted arrived darkness had fallen when kay clattered up to the flying six ranch house at her whoopee babs and ruth came dashing out to meet her dis- mounting she met them at the foot of the steps and they all three burst into the living room together their arms in- tertwined well well bless me if you don't all look the same age josh hastings got up and came toward them though he addressed the whole trio his eyes were fixed on kay with her bright eyes and flushed cheeks framed in a tousled mop of auburn curls kay instantly straightened up and smoothed her hair it was all she could do to repress the angry contempt and scorn she felt for this man who had tried by such sneaking means to get the best of her but she realized that for the moment at least she must act as though nothing had happened to change her usual attitude toward him where've you been all day aunt kate's querulous question broke the awkward moment and kay turned to her with relief i was terribly sorry not to get over sooner she apologized as she con- tritely went over and kissed her aunt but i was waiting around for ted gay- nor to come back with his mother and sister a curious pause followed these words and something made kay glance up keenly at josh hastings his eyes were narrowed on her with an enigmatic stare and a half smile twisted his lips into a sinister line kay felt a cold un- reasoning clutch at her spine and it was with the greatest difficulty that she re- pressed the involuntary shudder that contracted her muscles the memory of that premonition she had had when ted said good-by to her flashed over her again but she sternly ignored it no matter what josh hast- ings had tried to do to her she couldn't blame him for ted's failure to appear she at least had to be fair enough to admit that i reckon you've made a mistake tak- ing on that man and a whole parcel of relatives aunt kate broke through the strained moment it'll be a good thing if he doesn't show up at all josh hastings let out a great guffaw trust aunt kate to hit the nail on the head he exclaimed with indulgent appreciation she's said a mouth- ful sure i have aunt kate agreed com- placently a pleased smile on her lips at the flattery of her host's glance perhaps i have made a mistake kay obeyed a sudden wicked impulse and added if they aren't coming you --ranch romances--first sept  ranch romances and babs could come back now and have that cabin well seein you've promised it to them i reckon you'll have to see it through kay smiled at aunt kate's hurried change of tactics as she saw herself transferred from the comfort of her pres- ent quarters to the rigors of pioneer life in a cabin how about that timberland you were thinking of buying the last time you were here josh hastings tone was elaborately careless as he put this ques- tion but his eyes were alert as he stud- ied kay's expression to try to discover whether or not scrap johnson had told her what his errand to town that day had been the fact that kay had come over to the flying six would seem to indicate that she had not discovered his effort to double-cross her but josh hastings was eager to get this point cleared up if scrap had told her he'd have quite a bit of explaining to do and he had a plausible yarn all ready but if she knew nothing about it his best line was to let well enough alone oh yes i was telling you about that kay met his glance with wide- eyed innocence i bought it up in fact one of my punchers was in town attending to it for me that afternoon i was here didn't i mention it no you didn't josh hastings ef- forts to conceal his feelings were less successful than kay's and she smiled inwardly with wicked satisfaction at his disgusted tone well if you take my advice you'll sell out while you've got a chance aunt kate put in her word josh hastings here is giving you the best offer you're likely to get perhaps kay turned to the door to hide the flash of anger she felt against her aunt for being such an easy tool in josh hastings hands i'll have to be getting back now i'm going with you josh hastings announced no you mustn't kay expostulated angry at herself for not having fore- seen this outcome of her visit i'd rather go alone it's moonlight and i'm not the least bit afraid that's not the point josh hast- ings reached up for his hat and coat i'm doing this for my own pleasure realizing that she was fairly caught and that to protest any further would be to attach undue importance to the situation kay gave in as gracefully as she could and after saying good night to babs and her aunt the two started off together chapter xxii trapped again for some time kay and josh hast- ings rode through the moonlight without saying anything as he had in- sisted on coming kay decided to leave the burden of the conversation to him and the magic of the night inevitably drew her thoughts to ted the long rolling reaches of the mesa stretched out in a silver radiance before them broken only by ghostly clumps of brush with their weird twisted shad- ows lengthening in the moonlight if only ted had come when he had said he would she would be taking this ride with him instead of josh hastings kay reflected with a renewed wave of dis- appointment as though reading her thoughts her companion suddenly broke the long silence chiming in with what she was thinking with an uncanny in- sight your aunt kate was right about that gaynor guy kay his tone was full of a friendly protection there are a few things i want to tell you about him and then i think you'll agree with her yes kay waited non-committally for what he had to say although her eyes held a hostile disbelief of anything it might be i'm surprised that he'd have the nerve to come to any range where he knew i was josh hastings went on but i reckon he won't stay long even fire frenzy  if he does show up--which i doubt why asked kay interestedly josh hastings hesitated then brought out with a show of reluctance it's an ugly story but i think you ought to know it for your own protection when i had my ranch over in the clear water basin this gaynor was punching for old man gage of the x bar l he was involved in a rustling raid of his boss cattle and the shooting of his son he paused a moment then added there was a girl mixed up in it too but i won't go into that you may as well give me the whole story now you've started kay's voice was coldly unconvinced and josh hast- ings flared up at her implied disbelief just a pretty case of promising to marry the girl and then deserting her josh hastings shot a sidelong look at kay to get her reaction to this news and as he caught the quick look of sur- prised unbelief he added she com- mitted suicide how do you know that ted gaynor was responsible for her committing suicide kay demanded hotly the story was certainly ugly but she found it impossible to associate it with ted he couldn't have been guilty of a thing like that it sounded much more like the sort of thing of which josh hastings himself would be capable it was common talk hastings an- swered her indignant question with a more tolerant tone i don't wonder you are startled but now you can see the probable reason for his disappear- ance he knew you'd hear his story sooner or later from me and figured he'd better clear out while the going was good for several moments they rode on in silence then kay said slowly i'm cer- tainly not going to condemn anyone by common talk and rumor you ought to have something more tangible to go on before you spread a story like that to ruin a man's reputation josh hastings gave a short laugh i must say your confidence in me isn't any too flattering would you repeat that story to ted gaynor's face kay demanded sure i would but don't worry i won't have to hastings sneered take my word for it that talk about showing up again with his mother and sister was all one grand bluff kay made no answer but she touched flicker with her heel and set a sharper pace for home she didn't for one min- ute believe josh hastings story but she was animated by a sudden impera- tive desire to get rid of his hateful presence what's the hurry he pounded up beside her and reaching over put a possessive hand on her arm it's a crime to go rushing through a moon- light night at this pace slow down and i'll promise not to tell you any more sordid stories kay's only answer was to shake her arm free and urge flicker on to greater speed an ugly look settled on josh hastings face as he was forced by her action to follow suit flicker was a faster horse than his and he had no more time for talking if he was going to keep up already he was losing ground a bit and as kay glanced over her shoulder and saw him falling behind a reckless spirit of mischief overcame her pru- dence she knew it was a silly thing to rouse his temper but she couldn't resist the temptation to pay him back for telling her that story about ted realizing perfectly that nothing was more galling to a man's pride than to be left behind by a girl she deliber- ately pushed flicker to the limit and streaked ahead of him she had arrived at the corral turned flicker loose and was just starting back to her cabin when hastings came pounding up he pulled up so sharply that his horse slipped to its haunches and almost went down the next in- stant he was off and before kay could guess his intention he seized her in his arms and pressed his lips savagely to hers that'll teach you not to play mon-  ranch romances key tricks with me his voice was thick with rage and passion as he held kay's shoulders in an iron grip and bent his face close to hers you'd bet- ter learn it now because i mean to marry you you little spitfire regardless of kay's blazing eyes and her choked let me go as she writhed in his grasp he kissed her again then he sprang into his saddle and galloped off without a backward look panting and trembling with fury kay watched him go her mind seething with the outrage it had all taken place in such a fraction of a sec- ond that she could hardly believe that it had happened at all with a gasp of disgust she wiped the back of her hand across her lips and clenched her fist as she gazed after the retreating figure in the moonlight much as she had disliked josh hast- ings she had never thought to be on her guard against a thing like this why he was old enough to be her father she grabbed her handkerchief and scrubbed her lips as though to cleanse them of his polluting touch marry him a shudder ran through her and a weak helpless feeling of dread laid a cold clutch on her heart suddenly she felt utterly defenseless and alone whom could she turn to aunt kate and babs were completely under josh hastings spell she could expect no help from them and if ted failed her    josh hastings insinuating story flashed in her mind and in spite of her disbelief she found herself going over it bit by bit even if the worst inferences about the girl were false ted had probably been involved in some way with her and there was that other rumor about the dark-haired girl he had fought over that very day when he had later come so splendidly to her rescue kay straightened up suddenly and walked quickly back to the cabin her head proudly high though her breath still came in quick uneven jerks it was certainly nothing to her how many girls ted had all she wanted him to come back for was to build her house and barn for her memory of josh hastings kiss flashed over her again running up the steps of her cabin she hastily lit a candle and flung herself down at her father's desk something in its very solidity and the associations that clung around it gave her a comforting sense of strength he thinks he's going to marry me does he kay savagely pulled open a drawer and took out some paper we'll see about that she scribbled a note to aunt kate saying that she was going to send over for them the next afternoon they could have her cabin and she could sleep outside in her sleeping bag sign- ing it without further explanation she left it on her desk so that she could give it to one of the boys to take over the first thing in the morning then with the same feverish haste she undressed and flung herself into bed after a restless night of both wak- ing and sleeping nightmares kay was out at the crack of dawn and over at the bunkhouse with her note when she had actually dispatched shorty with the summons to her family to leave the flying six she felt better by the time breakfast was over she had persuaded herself that josh has- tings had made up that story out of whole cloth for the sole purpose of damaging ted in her eyes when ted comes back i'm going to tell him the whole thing she re- solved as she made her way over to the bunkhouse to consult seth about getting another cot put up in her cabin it was nearly ten o'clock before shorty came back from the flying six kay hastily tore open the note he handed her addressed in her aunt's cramped old-fashioned handwriting a slow color rose in her cheeks as she read it through and then started it over again she was suddenly aware of shorty's eyes on her and biting her fire frenzy  lip to steady herself she looked up at him thanks shorty there isn't any an- swer she turned away with the note clenched in her hand and ran down to her cabin seated at the desk she spread it out before her and incredulously read its surprising contents again dear kay don't be a fool you're not the first girl to be kissed on a moonlight night josh hastings has told me all about it and his generous and hon- orable intentions toward you i certainly have no idea of com- ing back until the house is finished you can insist on babs coming but you'll be pulling a hornet's nest about your ears if you do i say again don't be a fool your affectionate aunt kate kay drew a long quivering breath as she settled back and gazed at the door where some flies buzzed drowsily in the heat suddenly one of them brushed against a cobweb and became more and more enmeshed as it tried to get away with an impulsive move- ment kay jumped up put a finger through the web and set the insect free if only someone would do that for me she murmured as she settled down and read aunt kate's letter again forcing herself not to let her judg- ment be influenced by her indignation she tried to consider the situation calmly what aunt kate said about babs was perfectly true kay realized that she hadn't any too strong a hold over babs headstrong and self-willed nature and if she insisted on her com- ing back in the face of aunt kate's de- termination to stay life wouldn't be worth living viewed in the light of aunt kate's scornful reproval of kay's attitude it did seem ridiculous to make such a fuss about a moonlight kiss by fore- stalling her and telling aunt kate about it and his desire to marry her josh hastings had cut most of the ground for righteous indignation from under her feet there just didn't seem any way to fight this insidious move of josh has- tings to get her family under his in- fluence and lined up against her she could tell aunt kate about his plot to get her timberland away from her but that would involve telling the whole beastly experience with scrap john- son and kay had none too much con- fidence in her aunt's discretion to want to trust her with that story besides she'd probably explain away josh hastings part in it by saying that he'd been trying to protect her from a foolish move as long as she was caught in the trap she might as well accept it gracefully to have babs at home in a rebellious mood when there was so much to be done would be any- thing but a help and to put such tragic emphasis on a kiss snatched in the moonlight was to magnify the impor- tance of it out of all proportion reluctantly admitting that perhaps she had been a fool to be quite so hasty and dramatic about it kay crunched up the note and threw it into the waste basket chapter xxiii whose gun two days had passed and still there was no sign of ted gaynor i don't undertsand it flicks kay whispered brokenly as she slipped off flicker's bridle and leaned her head for a moment against his mane do you suppose-- she broke off abruptly as she saw shorty coming towards her hi there let me do that he took the bridle from her hand you hop to it and get some chow or you'll be out of luck thanks shorty kay braced her- self and tried to smile has everyone finished seth and a couple of the boys are still there shorty answered bending down to flicker's cinch what d'you think of the timber we're cutting  ranch romances i think it's fine only i hate to see those great tamaracks come crashing down now ain't that just like a girl shorty commented to flicker cocking a quizzical eye at kay to catch the ef- fect of his words here we're break- ing our backs building a barn for her and she wants us to keep the trees to have picnics under no i don't shorty kay laughed at shorty's comical expression in spite of her heavy heart i'm as anxious to get the barn built as you are only i wish   she left the sentence un- finished sure so do i shorty agreed an- swering kay's unspoken thought with the freedom of an old friend you know it almost seems as though some- thing must have happened to that guy he wasn't the kind to go back on his word he wasn't was he kay agreed eagerly then fearful of saying too much once the flood-gates of her trou- bled thoughts were opened she turned and made for the mess shack as she and seth were discussing the dimensions of the new barn a sudden clatter of hoofs broke in on them springing to her feet with a quick premonition of trouble kay was half- way to the door when it was suddenly darkened by the lanky figure of zeke farley the sheriff of butte county hello there he pulled off his hat as his eye caught kay you're just the girl i wanted to see do you know that gun for a moment everything swam be- fore kay's eyes as she caught sight of the gun the sheriff held out to her she felt as though every drop of blood was drained from her heart while she stared at it and braced herself against one of the chairs conscious of curious faces crowded into the doorway behind the sheriff she cleared her throat once or twice before she could bring herself to speak why--why yes she faltered that was one of dad's seth came around the table beside her and took the gun out of the sher- iff's hand sure it was he corrobo- rated then he added before kay could stop him but look here wasn't this the one you gave to that gaynor guy what's that the sheriff snapped his keen eyes traveling from seth to kay gave it to who when where is he now kay moistened her lips before at- tempting to answer this rapid fire of questions her mind was leaping in lightning flashes from one desperate conjecture to another what did this gun in zeke farley's hands mean was ted hurt--or killed or had he killed someone else beating through her fears for him was the instinctive feeling that she must watch her step and not say something that would incriminate him where--where did you find it she stalled for time by meeting the sheriff's questions with another never mind that now zeke far- ley spoke more gently as he saw kay's distress but his eyes were none the less keen just tell us everything you know about it realizing that all she could do was to tell the truth kay explained how she had given the gun to ted gaynor and had last seen it when he started off for clear water basin to get his mother and sister and bring them back how did the gun come into your hands kay ended forcing herself to face the facts whatever they might be the sheriff hesitated and gave an im- perceptible nod to seth over kay's head don't you worry about that he evaded soothingly i'll talk to seth outside no you won't kay interposed her eyes flashing and her body straight and taut with determination you've got to tell me anything you have to say about it i won't be kept in suspense the sheriff shrugged well i reckon you've got to hear about it fire frenzy  sooner or later so there's no point in making a mystery about it also i want to know all you can tell me about this gaynor guy--where you met him and how long you've known him and so forth but how did you come by the gun kay insisted you must tell me that first the sheriff took the gun back from seth and gravely weighed it in his hand as he eyed it critically there ain't much doubt he said slowly but what this gun has killed a man kay put her hand up to her throat yes--yes--go on one of the fire patrol was coming back over the divide yesterday and there by the headwaters he found a dead man shot through the temple and not thirty feet away he came on this gun lying where the murderer had left it the dead man was a mile or so over on the idaho side of the state line but this guy was headed this way so he brought the gun down to me i called up the sheriff at clear water basin but he was off after a bunch of rustlers and his deputy asked me to help out on the job until he could join me who was the man kay got the question out through parched lips a fellow named scrap johnson who was one of the flying six outfit he-- he got no further for kay with a cry of mingled relief and dismay sud- denly crashed down on the chair near her no--no i'm all right she pushed seth and the sheriff away as they reached out to steady her it's just the horrible thought of dad's gun being involved in a murder that-- but how do you know it was murder she demanded with renewed energy there might have been a perfectly fair fight where's this gaynor bird then why didn't he report it a horrible fear clutched hold of kay perhaps he's killed too she fal- tered we've searched all around there the sheriff answered of course this two-day storm has washed out any tracks or clues we could go by but my hunch is that he made a getaway right after the killing and that he has va- moosed but why would he have left his gun behind kay protested he'd never have done such a stupid thing as that if he'd murdered a man search me but we've no time for guessing the sheriff answered impa- tiently tell me all you know about him he looked from kay to seth all i know seth broke in is that he turned up here the night of the fire kay had been having him look over some timberland for her and then de- cided to have him join the outfit where'd you get hold of him in the first place zeke farley turned to kay who braced herself for this ques- tion she had been dreading in the midst of her confused horror at this terrible news one thing was clear nothing would make her give the real version of her meeting with ted why i wanted to get hold of some more timberland she began and it seemed a good idea to get someone to go over it so i-- yes--yes never mind all that the sheriff cut her short what i want to know is how did you come to choose gaynor why not someone from around here i don't know just why kay sud- denly decided the only line to take was a helpless illogical feminine one i just thought i'd try him out and then if i liked him he could join the out- fit you thought he was a good addi- tion didn't you seth she appealed to seth with an attempt to defeat the sheriff's direct questions by irrele- vance sure i did seth answered he seemed like an a- hand to me but i've been kind of wondering about him  ranch romances when he didn't turn up when he said he would how long has this man been dead kay tried another tack to turn the line of the inquiry about four or five days i should judge zeke farley came back to the remark of seth's and asked what's that about his being expected back i'll tell you how it was kay fore- stalled seth he'd planned to go back to get his mother and sister and bring them here to live you see he'd worked out a plan for rebuilding with a few quick words she sketched out ted's ideas ending so i know he wouldn't have left us in the lurch unless something had hap- pened to him he might be wounded dead or dying himself while you're ac- cusing him of murder she choked up in spite of herself i think you ought to be searching for him to see if he's in trouble instead of fooling around about a gun she fixed the sheriff with an indignant eye we'll be searching for him all right the sheriff commented grimly i just wanted to make sure my hunch about the gun was right i thought i'd seen your father toting it now that i know you gave it to gaynor it clears up a lot and things look pretty black against him all right you probably don't know that he was heard threaten- ing this scrap johnson's life before quite a few witnesses before--witnesses kay faltered her mind flashing back to the scene on the mesa when ted had told scrap johnson he'd kill him if he ever showed up on the range again there certainly hadn't been any witnesses there besides herself yes the sheriff answered her amazed query gaynor and scrap johnson had a fight at kelly's joint one day last week and gaynor got the best of it according to some of the boys who were there he threatened to get scrap next time tom runyon's account of the fight at kelly's flashed in kay's mind and with a sick feeling she realized how black the evidence was that was piling up against ted but that's neither here nor there said the sheriff turning to the door the first thing is to join up with sam cutter the idaho sheriff and catch the bird we can save the evidence for later he slipped the gun into his pocket and picked up his hat sorry to be all this bother miss kay i've got to be getting on now but while i'm away you try to remember every single thing you can about this gaynor where are you going kay asked fearfully over into the clear water basin to look up his mother and sister first then i'll report to sam cutter's deputy and come back by the pass and search around there some more you'll let me know the minute you hear anything won't you kay tried to keep the desperate anxiety out of her tone we have no telephone now but you could get hold of babs at the flying six and she'll ride over and tell me sure i will zeke farley was al- ready in his saddle as he made this promise i hope you're right about his being on the square but i've got my doubts with this meager encouragement he picked up his reins and
