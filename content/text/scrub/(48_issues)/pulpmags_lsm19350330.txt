should ever receive a raise then one fortunate day he decided that the reason he wasn't getting anywhere was because he lacked special training he searched around a bit --asked a great many questions--and then en- rolled for a home-study course with the inter- national correspondence schools soon after i began studying he wrote to us the other day we had a change in management at our plant the new superintendent said that only men who had really studied their work were in line for positions as foremen i certainly was glad then that i had decided to study in my spare time for

is the one of your choosing you probably never will write lawyers must be law clerks doctors must be internes engineers must be draftsmen we all know that in our times the egg does come before the chicken it is seldom that any one becomes a writer until he or she has been writing for some time that is why so many authors and writers spring up out of the newspaper business the day-to-day

guidance you will find that instead of vainly trying to copy some one else's writing tricks you are rapidly developing your own distinctive self-flavored style--undergoing an experience that has a thrill to it and which at the same time de- velops in you the power to make your feelings articulate many people who should be writing become awe-struck by fabulous stories about millionaire authors and therefore give little thought to the   and  or more that can often be earned for ma- terial that takes little time to write--stories articles on business fads travels sports recipes etc--things

advertisements two in a fog by  gerry ann hale so you can see how impossible it all is rod finished jerkily his eyes not quite meeting melina's i thought you were - some one rich and important she supplied dryly and if you hadn't seen the hurt in her dark eyes you might have thought it didn't matter that the man who had pro- fessed his undying love for her not two days ago was now backing out lamely she looked away from his hands fumbling nervously with the tiny cup of after-dinner coffee outside the plate-glass window of the quiet side-street cafe the first eddying wisps of fog circled about the street lamps inside it was all warmth and soft light and heartbreak but can't you see what a fix i'm in he protested his handsome face sullen and darkened i'm poor i can't afford to get mixed up with a working girl melina inwardly shrank from the harshness of his voice there was no need of that she mused aloud because i had the bridal suite ou the empress you two in a fog  thought i was rich remember i told you i had only been to bermuda on business he shrugged impatiently i thought you were kidding he mut- tered there came the soft clatter of sil- ver and china rising over the room and from beyond the wide door the muted clamor of traffic melina shivered and picked up her purse why did you see me again then she demanded curiously it would have been easier to just- just not show up rod's lips tightened and for once he didn't look quite so handsome how did i know what you might do he said callously melina's smooth olive skin flushed darkly and for a moment her lips trembled then they parted in a swift breath of anger i can't forgive you for that she looked beautiful then brilliant with fury alive with suppressed emotion i may be one of those fools who work for a living but i'm not cheap if it had killed me i should never have sought you out her knees were lax with the fierce- ness of her anger and for a moment it looked as if she couldn't move then she rose leaning for a second on the table you have nothing to fear from me she told him bitterly from this moment on i don't know you never knew you never expect to know you he was on his feet too his face white his lips curled which is  k with me he muttered just as a slim dark man with gray eyes under a shock of blue- black hair strolled up to the table and said mildly i see i'm just in time roddy my boy to meet your charming dinner guest rod turned his head jerkily and melina saw him falter and then look at her with a mingling of fear and annoyance she read him correctly in an instant this man who had just come up was some one impor- tant and rod hated to introduce them it brought her head up proudly and her softly rounded chin took on a determined look so sorry- she moved a step away- i must hurry but the gray-eyed man wasn't to be put off so easily he put out a detaining hand if you think i walked across this entire room just to speak to rod landers you're terribly mistaken and again if you think i shall let you run off without being introduced then you don't know edward erin o'moore rod broke in hastily his voice al- most fawning melina thought how are you old man i'm just back from bermuda- but edward erin o'moore wasn't paying him one second's attention from his considerable height he was looking down at the averted outline of melina's face now what is your name he was demanding coolly i can't go on calling you lady or lassie all our lives rod was trying to break into a situation that was rapidly growing into a twosome with him very much on the outside he cleared his throat and essayed speech which again fell on deaf ears i say o'moore- melina lifted her eyes to the gray ones just over her head my name is melina otis spauld- ing and i work for a living she said bitterly her glance drifting to rod's suddenly scarlet face and then back to the gray-eyed man she  street amp smith's love story magazine drew on her gloves slowly knowing that if she hurried her hands would tremble furiously and now if you will let me pass- you may call me erin the gray-eyed man told her as he fell into step beside her leaving rod with a bare nod of his head i rather like the name melina it's odd just a bit old-fashioned she was stumbling a little by then because a sudden mist had come over her eyes erin o'moore took her elbow lightly and guided her as if it were the most natural thing in the world he pushed the door open and the damp cottony fog rolled to meet them somewhere on the way to the street he had acquired a topcoat and a battered felt hat and now while melina hesitated blindly in the en- trance he pulled the coat on shall we walk a bit he had her arm again this time gripped companionably tight to his side i like the feel of the fog- it's so damp- ish and clammy sometimes look at it against the lights slow burning tears were seeping out from under melina's long lashes there seemed no way to stop them they'd been gathering a long while -ever since rod had told her brutally that their shipboard ro- mance was ended almost before it had begun the man at her side sensed the tension across the cafe he had seen enough in both pairs of eyes to un- derstand you may as well get it out of your system he said casually lead- ing her across an intersecting street where red and green lights were just a colorful blur talk or yell it's the same to me i've listened to both in my time melina stiffened she had almost forgotten that erin o'moore was there she had been so immersed in her own misery she looked up at his profile sharply cut against the drifting fog and thought how different he was from rod rod had perfect features and a collar-ad smile but this man with his almost beaklike nose and twisted grin had something rod never would have- something hard to put one's finger on she said harshly won't it spoil your chances or something if some one sees you walking with a work- ing girl or is it that the fog will protect you go on he murmured equably it starts amazingly well melina shivered and drew the fur collar higher about her chin i'm sorry she said thickly but i'm all in the air i've just discov- ered that romance and the working girl doesn't mix despite the cinder- ella myth the movies are all wrong so are magazines and novels everything's all wrong apple strudel he scoffed and then stopped suddenly against a post that had appeared from the mist shades of st patrick i just missed carving my nose on that blasted post they stood momentarily still looking up at the dark outlines of the iron post the fog had thick- ened to a soupy consistency didn't know new york could go london one better erin o'moore mutteredlistening to the continu- ous hooting of cars half stalled in the avenues we'd best get out of this for a while melina frowned slightly coming alive to the problem of the moment where are we have you any idea he dropped her arm and shinned rapidly up the iron post before she could close her mouth his voice two in a fog  came down from the mist above we're practically on my home street he slid down the post and wiped his hands with a large handkerchief would you share my fireside and a high ball for an hour or so las- sie or do i look dan- gerous melina hesitated she knew no matter where they were then that she was a long way from her one room apart- ment over- looking the park rod had picked this cafe in which to dine with an eye to its being out of the way i'm not ex- actly a good companion to- night she said restlessly i'd like to break dishes and things then erin o moore took her arm again and turned left into the side street that showed even darker than the avenue even that he as- sured her placidly might be arranged there's some old crock- ery in the kitchen that i'm tired of looking at you'd be doing me a great favor if you'd break- and then melina laughed- a if you think i walked across this entire room just to speak to rod landers you're terribly mistaken and if you think i shall let you run off with- out being intro- duced then you don't know edward erin o'moore faint bit of laughter to be sure but nevertheless it was a step onward  street amp smith's love story magazine you're ridiculous i made you laugh is that something to crow over she tried hard not to be bitter absolutely it shows you aren't too far gone to be saved then he led her into a low door- way hospitably lighted by two old- fashioned iron lanterns inclosing electric bulbs the warm coziness of a narrow entrance hall enveloped them and the man led the way up long white steps to a high door set with brass knob and knocker my domain- bowing low and ushering her into a high-ceilinged room that breathed of peace and comfort melina dropped her coat on a red leather bench and looked appre- ciatively about dark woodwork and pale walls lighted by ivory- shaded lamps that cast a subdued light over bookcases built in half- way to the ceiling leather chairs and a fireplace scatter rugs worn and velvety warm red drapes drawn over sheer window curtains and the gleam of brass here and there do you like it he asked eagerly and looking at her eyes he knew without words i'm glad he added simply she sat down in front of the smoldering fire and stretched slim white hands toward the welcome warmth while the man busied him- self at the liquor cabinet so you met rod on the empress he began casually over his shoulder melina stiffened resentfully how do you like the ship i've been on her once or twice she relaxed feeling rather silly  i liked it at first she admitted with a burst of honesty i work for the company and i had to do some business for them down there that's why i had the bridal suite it was the only cabin not sold erin o'moore came over with a glass for her so rod thought you were at least miss empress he ven- tured melina nodded she knew sud- denly she was going to tell him everything she couldn't help it it was lovely while it lasted she confessed thickly i'd never been flirted with so expertly before he made the two days heavenly i hated to get back to new york then-- he found out you weren't a banker's daughter right right she told him flatly and then lifted her glass a toast to the working girl may she discover that all men aren't alike he added swiftly and they drank in silence he sat down opposite her and stretched with a sigh of relief toward the heat this is something like it- tilt- ing back his head and closing his eyes- with the fog outside and peace and a good companion inside melina relaxed under the spell of his voice it was soothing com- pelling in its very quietness she found some of the misery stealing from her heart and soul every- thing except this room this man was far away and unreal eyes closed she let it all seep into her blood and across the width of the hearth erin o'moore watched her from under half-closed lids and wondered at the faint stirrings in his heart they were like this when there came the muffled sound of voices from below then the clatter of feet and the sharp tap-tap of the knocker the man frowned with annoyance and sprang to his feet some pests i suppose to spoil a perfect evening he groaned two in a fog  he crossed the room slowly and flung open the door almost imme- diately the air was filled with laugh- ter and a feminine voice followed by a familiar masculine one melina turned her head automati- cally and looked straight into the amazed eyes of rod edward erin o'moore a lovely red-haired girl in pale-green satin dropped an ermine coat care- lessly on the floor to give both hands to the gray-eyed man you've treated me shamefully not a call not a line not a word- her glance slipped past him and fixed itself sharply on- melina's frozen face something jealous and ugly flamed for a moment in the topaz eyes of the newcomer oh i'm so sorry darling she purred coming into the room eyes frankly surveying melina if we had known we were intruding- erin o'moore sauntered behind her not at all jada my own we're just hiding from the fog for a bit this is miss spaulding- miss van dykerman he looked obliquely at rod shifting uneasily - in the background i believe you know mr landers melina smiled frostily no i'm afraid not she said clearly how do you do jada slid gracefully onto the hearth rug the faint light from the fire making her hair sparkle show- ing her skin to be even whiter than it appeared it's the fog that brought us in she explained narrowing her eyes seductively at erin o'moore we were on our way to the ritz and the taxi bumped into a post at the cor- ner here so here we are melina's nerves tingled from the tip of her head to the end of her little toe rod here in the same room handsome and poised now he was leaning against the mantel hope you don't mind old man he was saying easily to erin but jada would have it that we drop in in on you guess i can stand it erin drawled and jada laughed as though he had complimented her yet her eyes when they sought melina's were cold and just a bit cruel and who are you darling she demanded brightly at the liquor cabinet mixing drinks erin o'moore paused and listened his generous mouth grim melina looked down at the other girl at some other time perhaps she might have felt ill at ease facing an obvious society girl but now somehow it was a matter of no im- portance i'm a working girl she said smoothly you should try it some- time it's good for the figure jada stiffened and the smile wreathing her lips grew just a bit forced i don't think my figure needs it she cooed do you think so erin he came over with two tall glasses what reducing he raised his brows well a bit off the waist might help jada flushed darkly and drank half her high ball in a furious gust of anger rod's eyes darkened and his lips too tightened in anger ranger at melina she caught him glaring at her when she lifted her eyes indif- ferently to his face what's the matter mr landers she asked coolly did your drink go down the wrong way erin o'moore laughed suddenly and went to turn on the radio i think a bit of music might  street amp smith's love story magazine help he chuckled into a tense si- lence the music that drifted so en- chantingly into the room didn't help much it served only to send jada nearer erin and left rod uneasily trying to carry on a one-sided con- versation with melina melina sipped her drink and gazed absent-mindedly into the dying fire she was analyzing her feelings sorting them out carefully and laying them at her feet rod after that first amazing mo- ment when he had walked into the room had done nothing to her heart except perhaps harden it a little his obvious relief when she had ac- cepted erin o'moore's introduction filled her with contempt and again his too obvious eagerness to be with jada van dykerman was overpoweringly offensive at this moment he was glancing uneasily at jada sitting on a stool at erin's feet resting her lovely white arms on his knees while she tallied softly to him melina could see the impotence of his anger surg- ing within him what's the matter- she glanced up at rod carelessly- is your big fish nibbling at another bait he flushed angrily and turned his back on her i say jada- going to bend over the red-haired girl- don't you think we could barge along i imagine the fog has lifted a bit by now erin got to his feet and glanced humorously across-at melina i hope the fog is thinning out he said innocently but when he went to draw aside the red drape the fog was even worse it clung thickly to the glass outside erin whistled looks worse he muttered just as the radio inter- rupting its dance program issued a news bulletin the police department is send- ing out a warning- the voice of the announcer came with startling sud- denness- that all those who are in- doors remain there until the fog lifts somewhat right now it is ex- ceedingly dangerous in the streets already there have been more than a score of fatal accidents oh jada sighed ecstatically how delicious it is the worst fog ever to hit new york went on the radio it is due to lift sometime in the early- morning hours until then- what rotten luck rod mut- tered under his breath and kicked a footstool out of his way erin raised his crooked dark brows i should be the one to say that me lad melina was on her feet staring in bewilderment at her host then that means i can't leave yet she asked slowly erin o'moore shook his head his eyes kindling suddenly it will give me the greatest pleasure to be your host for a few hours longer jada tossed her head and slid her hand through his arm taking his speech as a direct compliment to herself you're absolutely precious erin darling it's no wonder i love you so terribly she purred but erin slid just as easily away from her and crossed to a door opening into another room you love too easily jada me girl tis not the way of the irish any one would think you'd been born over there she pouted in- stead of in new york itself he disappeared into the other room and lights flashed on a mo- ment later he was back there now girls- looking ls f two in a fog  straight at melina- there's every- thing handy for you if you get tired and want to rest there are clean sheets on the bed clean towels on the rack and pajamas slightly big but serviceable if you want to sleep melina looked at the clock on the mantel why it was almost mid- night already she should be in bed now getting ready for to-morrow's work i think if you don't mind she ventured i'll take a nap erin came over and took her arm his hand somehow compelling arrest is there any one you should notify he wanted to know quietly she shook her head feeling some- thing warm and comforting steal into her heart no one at all she went into the other room just as jada reached erin again and drew his arm close about her waist can't you find a place for rod to nap a bit she cooed then you and i could talk melina heard erin o'moore laugh softly just before she closed the door and because it was the tolerant laugh of one who brushed away a persistent insect melina was some- how glad she looked about the bedroom it was typically masculine the dark furniture that was severe yet com- fortable the wide windows with tailored curtains and off to one side a sedate bath done in black and white melina slipped off her dress and hung it carefully on a rack then she went into the bathroom to luxuriate in steaming hot water and faintly scented soap later feeling refreshed and ready for sleep she entered the room to find jada curled up on the foot of the bed surveying her nails after a moment she looked up and stared shrewdly at melina then she smiled slightly so you're a working girl she murmured melina disliked her intensely she knew it definitely how yes she returned shortly thinking how very beautiful the other girl actually was in the mir- ror she could see her own reflection and to herself she looked plain and shiny-faced i don't suppose you make an awful lot jada went on i mean you wouldn't turn up your nose at making a bit- of extra money would you faint alarm rang somewhere within melina she stood quite still and watched jada through the glass what do you mean she asked sharply jada uncoiled herself and stood up if i made it worth your while would you get out of here no i'll put it this way get out and i'll - make it worth your while she looked at melina boldly challeng- ingly and if you don't get out well it won't make much difference melina brushed her hair mechani- cally while a string of bewildered thoughts rushed through her mind what for she demanded bluntly why should i risk break- ing my neck in this fog jada drew in a sibilant breath and her eyes were pieces of yellow flint i don't know why i bother to ex- plain she said icily as if melina were too insignificant a person to ad- dress at all it just happens that i want to be alone with mr o'moore and you are in my way now do you understand challenging yellow eyes glared at her insolently but somehow melina wasn't much impressed oh she drawled so that's the ls-f  street amp smith's love story magazine in an instant melina had her dress on and was fastening it up while erin pushed open the door and peered in i've decided not to take a nap she said i think i'll come in and keep you company way they do it on the avenue frame the man when you can't get him otherwise jada gave a sudden furious scream why you cheap little- she seemed about to leap at melina her gleaming nails curved for battle but melina's slim white hands reached out and gripped the other's narrow wrists holding them away from her face for a long moment she stared at her disgust in her eyes if you think she began grimly releasing her with a push that sent jada stumbling back to the bed that i'll be a party to any scheme of yours for trapping mr o'moore you're crazy jada sat up striving for non- chalance you're making a play for him yourself she sneered melina shrugged no i'm not she said slowly but now that you mention it he is worth fighting for isn't he a charming person two in a fog  jada stood up her face ashily pale you keep away from him do you hear me she cried clenching her teeth desperately he's mine and no one else shall have him melina dreamily surveyed herself in the mirror he seemed to like me she murmured he'd be so comfortable to live with- shut up jada shrieked and then a knock sounded on the door hello in there erin o'moore's voice came anxiously through what's all the noise about in an instant melina had her dress on and was fastening it up while erin pushed open the door and peered in his eyes sought hers first and somewhere deep inside her melina was glad it was she thought vaguely get- ting to be a habit feeling glad about erin o'moore what's up he was asking his eyes very intent though his voice made his words of no consequence melina went to him without look- ing at jada not a thing she as-  sured him only i've decided not to take a nap i think i'll come in and keep you company erin o'moore grinned widely and bowed low the best news i've had since you decided to take a nap enter lady fair rod was standing by the window scowling out at the fog when melina came in he turned and di- rected his scowl at her but she merely raised her brows madden- ingly and strolled over to sit be- fore the dead embers of the fire her host followed something bril- liant yet soft glowing in his eyes standing over her arms folded across his chest he said simply it took those minutes out of my sight to make me know melina flushed hotly and then wondered why across the room rod cleared his throat loudly but erin went on as if they were alone i had begun to wonder about my- self and you for some reason you drew my eyes clear across the cafe to-night i couldn't eat with the same appetite afterward he stopped and his eyes searched her face intently melina stirred restlessly she felt strange taken up out of herself something of what this man felt en- tered her blood we're strangers she mur mured you know nothing of me he flung up his head do any of us ever truly know one another even after years of living together she mused on that remembering things she had heard they say that- that there is no such thing as love at first sight he put in quickly perhaps there isn't his eyes held hers but whatever this is i feel for you if it isn't love it might just as well be because- jada's voice issuing from the bed- room interrupted him and melina was conscious of quick resentment she had to hear more rod come here will you jada called and rod with a mut- tered excuse disappeared into the other room and closed the door erin shrugged a lovely couple melina smoothed her skirt care- fully you were saying she prompted casually too casually and in an instant erin o'moore was kneeling at her feet so that he could look up into her eyes his whole face lit up with tenderness his hands strong and steady on hers then you aren't exactly bored he asked gently even if you don't believe in love at first sight melina took a deep breath it was becoming difficult to breathe the way she should it was being so  street amp smith's love story magazine close to him she thought the strength of him flowing out robbed her of sane reasoning i- i didn't say i didn't believe in it she stammered a little it's just- well after all we've never seen each other before he lifted her hands one by one and kissed them his lips lingering warmly on their coolness and his eyes never once left her face i'm not rushing you he told her i'm just warning you that you may as well start thinking of me because one day soon you'll have to make up your mind nowhere a sound save the low murmur of his voice and the steady ticking of a clock and then break- ing the moment wide in two came rod's voice and this time he called melina he stood in the door of the bed- room i wonder if you'd come in and help jada he asked politely she doesn't feel so well melina even while she moved to go into the room wondered there was something distinctly peculiar about this erin raised his brows inquiringly something more he muttered under his breath melina passed rod and saw jada lying across the bed her face buried in her arms she went over and asked what's the matter what can i do jada rolled over and sighed some water i think melina glanced at rod who had closed the bedroom door behind her then she went into the bathroom and got a glass the sound of the water running must have deadened the sound of rod's steps for with- out even the faintest warning melina looked up and saw him in the bathroom door listen melina we've got to talk he said urgently something of his old fascination gleaming in his eyes he had looked like this on the empress melina thought re- motely- eager and in love there's nothing more to say she said thinly that's all over and done with he came further in and half shut the door it can't be over not the way i feel about you she stood backed against the glass-inclosed shower what's got- ten into you i love you that's what it is he took a long step that brought him to her side i'm mad about you it doesn't matter if you aren t rich nothing matters except our love our love she evaded his hands and stepped back of the wash bowl tell me when to laugh she added bitterly he was so handsome- handsome and weak and shallow melina saw him clearly in an ugly light and what she saw she didn't like come with me now he begged let's go to my place where we can be alone i've so much to say slowly she shook her head if every word you uttered was worth ten dollars you couldn't give me two cents he flushed darkly and bit his lips i can make you change your mind he warned sulkily we're all alone in here you know then melina knew what the trick had been jada was probably pay- ing rod well to keep her out of the way while she worked on erin even as she thought it a scream rang out from the other room melina started but rod barred her way it's only jada doing her stuff two in a fog  he grinned unpleasantly erin o'moore will be glad to do whatever she says when she gets through put- ting on her act clever isn't she melina reached for the glass she had put down filled it calmly with water and then before rod knew what she was up to flung it squarely in his face and while he yelled and blinked in the sudden deluge she was around him and into the bed- room it took only a moment to cross to the living room and then standing in the door she looked swiftly about there was jada standing open-mouthed in the center of the floor staring wildly about melina stared too there was no erin o'moore- no one at all there except the two of them melina said dryly you may as well put on your dress miss van melina went into the room and looked swiftly about there stood jada melina said dryly you may as well put on your dress miss van dyker- man the ob- ject of your affections has neglected to remain  street amp smith's love story magazine dykerman the object of your affections has neglected to remain jada whirled to face the door oh you- you little- she screamed just as a thundering knock sounded on the door and an authoritative voice demanded open in the name of the law melina looked questioningly at jada shall i or will you do the honors jada grabbed up her dress and flung it about her shoulders then she flounced into the bedroom melina crossed to the door and flung it open on two policemen what's going on in here the first one growled we heard a woman yelling melina raised her eyebrows really she seemed amazed you must have made a mistake in the house officer no one screamed in here she stepped back from the door invitingly you may come in if you wish and look around the first officer looked at the sec- ond who shrugged well- the spokesman touched his cap- we won't come in but we won't be far away in case it comes again we ain't taking chances to-night what with the fog and all melina closed the door behind them and leaned weakly against it for a moment get out of my way jada sailed into the room her dress on again and behind her stalked rod un- comfortably wet and angry he refused to even look at melina going straight for his hat and coat and flinging them on hastily jada threw her ermine about her shoul- ders and tossed her head are you coming rod she de- manded harshly together they marched through the door melina was alone then in the quiet room alone and wondering what had happened to erin o'moore psst a faint hissing drew her attention to a corner near the win- dows that was in deeper shadow than the rest of the room who- what- who's there she called nervously beginning already to back away toward the door are we alone it was erin o'moore's voice and while she looked around he stepped from be- hind one of the red drapes his black hair more tousled than ever and a devilish twinkle in his eyes glory be he laughed softly coming over to her to think that a son of ireland should find himself running away hiding from a slip of a girl melina dropped suddenly into the nearest chair conscious of a strange weakness about her legs i think she said weakly i'm going to faint he was at her side in an instant sober anxious darlin don't do that i didn't mean to frighten you come look at me her head slid to his shoulder as if it had the right to be there and when she lifted her lashes she could look right into his eyes what happened she wanted to know wonderingly his eyes twinkled again jada pulled a beautiful scene worthy of a better cause all about love and how no one would get me- you know the sort of thing melina nodded and when she started pulling off her things well i just disappeared a tiny chuckle began to ripple up in melina's throat you should have seen her face when i came in he was serious then his eyes somber what did rod do to you in there i heard no sound melina edged away from him two in a fog  he tried to sell me an old yarn that wasn't worth a moment's con- sideration erin o'moore studied her eyes at length sure of that very slowly very seriously melina nodded very sure he sighed abruptly and drew her to her feet it's time to be walking home now he said his arms slipping easily across her shoulders i have much to say to you and i dare not say it here it is too easy to love you his eyes dreamed down into hers and somehow her heart rose lightly to answer she smiled at him tenderly do you think he asked wist- fully there is a chance for me for answer melina reached up and drew his head down and then she kissed him lightly on both cheeks he reached out for her con- vulsively and then with main effort drew back his arms if i touch you now he said thickly adoringly i'll never let you go her arm slid about his neck swiftly i'm thinking she whis- pered amazingly that i won't want to go he held her with fierce tenderness cradling her close his lips tasting the sweetness of hers lingering on her cheek her eyes her hair they remained so until finally an alien note sounded from the dim outer world the clatter of milk bottles it is time my sweet to go home now he held her aside with one arm and reached for her coat with the other but later- nine o'clock to be exact we have an engage- ment at the municipal building am i right colleen always right dearest melina sighed dreamily from his shoulder winter sale for sale a castle hill with many halls done up in oak and willow with a stream furnished in newest fern and crystal walls and small carillons where its pebbles dream great lawns completely round it to insure a rest for gypsy nightingales and those grave bands of fiddling crickets that endure the longest march to serenade a rose in beautiful condition clean

smiling april passing by bert cooksley  young and beautiful by  jo franklin beverly standing on the bal- cony outside the hotel room sighed at the loveliness of the night the moon was painting a silvery dancing path on the lake's dark surface soft strains of music floated up from below and some- where down there was that hand- some dark-eyed young man whose name she did not even know she turned her head and called aren't you ready yet mother the dancing in the grill has com- menced just a minute more darling beverly left the balcony and en- tered the room where her mother sat at the dressing table fastening a rope of pearls about her throat mother be sure to have that young and beautiful  necklace put in the hotel safe to- night reminded beverly you forgot to last night and i was so nervous i couldn't sleep you worry too much said mrs fenwick gayly don't forget that these pearls are insured for fifty thousand dollars yes mother but a robbery wouldn't be funny and you're so careless about picking up new ac- quaintances oh stop lecturing beverly speaking of new acquaintances- after dinner the hotel hostess in- troduced me to that distinguished- looking man we noticed in the din- ing room his name is luis se- bastian he's very charming and what do you think he said to me that he thought you and i looked like sisters instead of mother and daughter answered beverly promptly how did you ever guess good heavens mother don't people say it wherever we go bev- erly asked somewhat mournfully well yes they do smiled mrs fenwick with a pleased look at her reflection the glass mirroring their images testified that mrs fenwick and her nineteen-year-old daughter did in- deed look like sisters beverly's fig- ure was no slenderer in her white evening gown than her mother's in a blue one mrs fenwick's hair due to daily treatment was an even more lustrous gold than that of her daughter the mother's eyes were a light blue while beverly's eyes shaded toward violet both had the gorgeous com- plexions that go with such fair col- oring both were beautiful mrs fenwick's beauty was doll-like and dainty compared with the healthy glowing attractiveness of her daugh- ter really mr sebastian is very in- teresting mrs fenwick went on he has traveled all over the world and he's a delightful talker and oh by the way i also met that ath- letic-looking young man which one do you mean bev- erly spoke calmly but her heart gave a queer little flipflop of an- ticipation you know- the only other at- tractive man in the hotel the quiet one who's been sitting shyly on the porch reading his name is gordon larrimore what do you say beverly we go down now gather him and mr sebastian in and hint that they take us to the grill for dancing mother beverly was partly thrilled partly apprehensive please don't ask them outright of course not laughed mrs fenwick leave it to me to be subtle and stop looking so wor- ried sometimes i feel you're ten years older than i beverly selecting a wrap sighed she felt the same way her mother seemed so irresponsible it was nice to have a young beautiful mother but sometimes she envied other girls girls who had stout middle- aged mothers with graying hair- mothers who were not always sur- rounded by fascinated young men who did not eclipse their shy youngs daughters beverly was not unsympathetic with her mother's keen enjoyment of being youngish and sought-after she knew that mrs fenwick mar- ried when very young to a man twenty years her senior had for years led a dull existence it was only several years ago that left a widow with a good income she had really blossomed out and begun to enjoy life because of her earlier repression  street amp smith's love story magazine mrs fenwick now craved gayety in deep gulps she wanted to make up for the lost years of youth she rev- eled in the admiration of younger men beverly often squirmed un- comfortably feeling that her mother was a bit too frivolous especially when enlivened by an extra cock- tail she lived in constant dread of mrs fenwick's becoming too fool- ish over some romantic youth fifteen minutes after they went down to the lobby due to skillful maneuvers on mrs fenwick's part mother and daughter were seated in the grill with them were gordon larrimore and luis sebastian while her mother chattered gayly beverly quietly studied the two men both had dark hair but gor- don's was dark-brown and crisp while sebastian's was dark and sleek sebastian's eyes were black and penetrating gordon's were hazel and had a glint of humor in them sebiastian might be the handsomer but she preferred gor- don's bronzed broad-shouldered good looks as the orchestra struck up both men turned to ask mrs fenwick for the first dance beverly was used to that she was delighted to see her mother choose sebastian as a partner she felt a sense of de- licious contentment as she and gor- don glided out upon the dance floor his first words however robbed the moment of its pleasure you have a very beautiful mother he observed his eyes were following mrs fenwick and sebastian you thrill me answered bev- erly do you always say such charming things he looked a trifle confused as he met her gaze well i was about to add that you greatly resemble her in fact when i first saw you together i thought- that we were sisters finished beverly you're only the nine hundred and fiftieth man to say that his eyes twinkled she felt that he perceived her inner exasperation then i'm not being very original am i i might as well say all the usual things how do you like it here at this quiet lake resort there's lots to do she told him boating swimming riding tennis how are you ait those things only fair he replied sounds too energetic for one who has come from an office for a few days rest she felt chagrined his whole ap- pearance suggested a love of the outdoors the average young man would have eagerly sought her com- pany in a round of sports why did he evade her- she wondered her heart sank at the thought that per- haps his interest was all for her fas- cinating mother her suspicions were borne out by the alacrity with which he asked mrs fenwick for the following dance for the next hour he and sebastian alternated in dancing with mother and daughter beverly had the all-too-familiar sensation of be- ing an outsider at the party her vivacious mother dominated the scene and claimed most of the two men's attention you're so silent to-night bev- erly remarked mrs fenwick dur- ing an interval between numbers i have a very quiet daughter gen- tlemen she throws the whole bur- den of conversation on me she is listening to you and learn- ing declared sebastian with an arch glance and she is a lucky girl to have such a charming in- structress young and beautiful  beverly decided that she could not en- dure to watch gordon acting like other young men who had fallen under her mother's spell i have a headache she announced if you'l excuse me i'll go to my room flatterer said mrs fenwick who loved compliments don't europeans say the sweetest things mr larrimore gordon smiled at her who wouldn't with you as an inspiration mrs fenwick her mother-beamed with pleasure and beverly decided that she could stand no more she rose from the table she could not endure to watch gordon acting like other young men who had fallen under her mother's spell i have a headache she an- nounced if you'll excuse me i think i'll take a stroll in the gar- den before going to my room the men rose politely and her eyes met those of gordon his were regretful and for a fleeting second she fancied he was about to accom- pany her then his gaze dropped and she left the room alone there were tears of vexation- and some- thing deeper than vexation- in her eyes beverly breakfasted alone the next morning she liked to go for a canter before the sun was high  street amp smith's love story magazine mrs fenwick seldom arose before ten o'clock as she was leaving the dining room beverly met gordon coming in his eyes widened at sight of her in her trim white riding habit she looked her charming youthful best and she knew it he stammered a good morning and added you're really dazzling miss fenwick if you don't mind my saying so i don't she smiled wickedly you're complimentary to mothers and daughters both i see how do you get on with grandmothers he looked taken aback at her sar- casm then his jaw squared grimly oh i'm a riot in an old ladies home would you like to hear my memoirs sometime of course she returned some rainy day by the fireside and you can wear your slippers and relax then she went out to where the groom stood with her horse mount- ing she galloped along the bridle trail that circled the lake the fresh morning air brightened her eyes-and stung vivid color into her cheeks it would have been per- fect if gordon had been riding with her she kept remembering the baffled look on his face her gibes had hurt him well if she could hurt him perhaps he was not indifferent to her there had been undisguised admiration in his eyes too no-doubt of that but the glow induced by these thoughts vanished two hours later as she rode back to the hotel she heard the gay voices of approaching riders through the trees her mother galloped into sight and rid- ing with her were gordon and se- bastian beverly smilingly returned the greetings of her mother and sebas- tian but her face froze a little as she met gordon's pleasant smile so you finally tottered out into the sunshine she said as if ad- dressing a white-bearded old man this time he refused to look hurt he reined in come along with us he invited and i'll race you five miles little one no thanks she declined you might collapse and not be able to play checkers to-night a spark leaped into his eyes look out i might take the pre- rogative of the elders you class me with and give you the spanking you need she laughed tantalizingly happy to see him stung by what she had said it isn't that i class you with my elders she returned it's that you can't tear yourself away from them and it's beginning to get you you're aging right before my eyes as he started to reply an impulse- of deviltry seized her raising her riding crop she brought it down sharply on his horse's flank the startled animal bolted giving him plenty to do to manage it looking after him she saw by the way he got the mount under control that he was an accomplished horseman she rode back to the hotel won- dering what had possessed her to act like that was it love was it love that made her so exasperated at gordon that she felt she hated him yet wanted to be in his arms did love make you so wistful and unhappy and yet so thrilly inside of you after lunch beverly arranged to have a canoe held for her at the landing she hoped that gordon would see her embarking perhaps it was this thought that led her to don her most becoming- and dar- ing- bathing suit young and beautiful  to her joy gordon was stand- ing on the side porch as she went toward the landing she pretended not to see him until he hailed her not going swimming in that icy lake are you pausing she looked up she had seen the eyes of many men widen with keen admiration at sight of her in a bathing suit but to see such a look on his face fairly made her tingle i'm going to paddle my own canoe she said that is unless i can find a strong man to help me how'd you like to ship on a voyage around the lake i'm awfully sorry a deepen- ing warmth of sincerity was in his tone but i've promised to make a fourth at bridge with mr sebas- tian your mother and another lady oh she caught her breath and again exasperation swept over her if his eyes really meant what they said why was he always at her mother's side better be careful she advised him mockingly you'll be tired out lifting those heavy cards i don't know how you stand the pace he glared down at her it isn t only your canoe that needs pad- dling he growled for a moment she thought he was going to vault the railing and carry out his threat then he glanced out over the lake and his expression changed lots of whitecaps on the water don't you think it's too choppy to go ca- noeing maybe for bridge players bev- erly retorted but i don't think so she swung on her heel and walked away disappointed that he called no reply after her as she started pad- dling from shore she could see him on the porch watching her then he went inside during the next two hours he reappeared at inter- vals no doubt when he was dummy she derived some satisfaction from believing that he was following her with his eyes pride alone kept her on the lake after the first half hour the water was choppy and the wind had a knifelike edge but she felt that to go ashore would be admitting that gordon had been right presently the wind increased and she decided to turn back she veered too sharply however letting the canoe's bow leap out of the water the swirling waves rushed under it and beverly found herself in the lake with the canoe capsized the water was icy-cold but after she caught her breath she was not alarmed she was an excellent swimmer about to start for shore she glanced toward the hotel there on the porch stood gordon's famil- iar figure knowing that she was cleanly visible to him she sent out a long piercing scream she saw him leap the railing and run to the landing there he re- moved his coat kicked off his shoes and dived into the lake as he cut through the water toward her with long strong strokes she perceived that he was an exceptionally good swimmer nearing the capsized canoe to which she clung he blinked the wa- ter from his eyes and called hoarsely miss fenwick bev- erly are you all right never better she responded cheerfully it was nice of you to swim out and visit me she smiled gayly at him his face grew grim as treading water he stared at her you don't seem to need help he  street amp smith's love story magazine said ominously what was all screaming for i wanted to see if you'd leave your bridge game she asserted now that you're here i'll race you back to shore for answer he lunged toward her the next moment beverly was grasped in his strong arms face down against the overturned canoe and spanked twice stingingly spluttering gasping when he released her she faced him her eyes blazing she felt out- raged and humiliated i hate you she cried how dared you do that to me you asked for it and you got it he an- swered his face was calm now and his eyes friendly and warm now let's get back to land i'll go back by my- self she cried go away and let me alone you brute i'm going with you he an- nounced resolutely if the water had not been so icy beverly would have remained there obstinately but she was becoming chilled she struck out for shore at her fastest pace hoping to outdis- tance him to her irritation he kept at her side with ease halfway to the landing her limbs began to grow leaden her body went numb and her head felt dizzy she turned a puzzled help- less look toward gordon he swam closer to her his brawny arm went across her shoulders and she sighed then she lost consciousness when she opened her eyes gor- don was lowering her gently into her bed behind him she glimpsed the anxious face of her mother and the countenance of the hotel physician i'm sorry she whispered weakly to gordon he smiled softly and let his hands come away from her slowly reluc- tantly then he stepped aside for the doctor beverly emerged from the esca- pade with nothing worse than a se- vere coldshe was forced to keep to her room for the rest of the week ordinarily this would have been hard enough on her active temperament now it meant not see- ing gordon and that made it ten times worse he sent her a large bouquet of flowers and she was thrilled almost to tears there was no florist at the resort she realized that he must have plucked those wild flowers after hours of tramping about the slopes they wilted in a day but she would not have them thrown out his flowers after dinner in her room serveral nights later she announced mother i feel well enough to go downstairs this evening in fact i could stand a couple of hours of dancing splendid my dear enthused mrs fenwick and it will be a great relief to me if you'll take gor- don larrimore off my hands for once he trails me everywhere i go and i haven't had five minutes alone with that fascinating sebas- tian really said beverly faintly her mother had no idea how her words tor at the girl's heart so he was still pursuing her mother of course i'm flattered by his young and beautiful  attentions mrs fenwick rattled on he and sebastian are both handsome both interesting- and both years younger than you especially gordon finished beverly i hope you're not tak- ing either of them seriously there you go always remind- ing me of my age her mother pouted other people don't think i'm as ancient as you do beverly i'm only five or six years older than luis sebastian and i don't look it sometimes i think you're jealous be- cause men seem to prefer my beauty i'm not jealous mother bev- erly protested nevertheless she felt a twinge of conscience she never had been jealous until gor- don appeared but i wish you'd become interested in older men like our lawyer who has adored you for years i'm always afraid you'll get silly over some young man and then-- her voice trailed off mrs fen- wick burst into tears you begrudge my having any fun in life i'll be old soon enough i think it's horrid of you beverly beverly sighed her mother was just like a child i'm sorry mother let's forget it she said putting her arms about the older woman affectionately all such scenes inevitably ended with beverly apologetic and remorseful mrs fenwick dabbing at her eyes took advantage of her daugh- ter's softened mood darling do something for me won't you we're leaving to-mor- row so this is the last night i can spend with luis what can i do asked beverly wonderingly you can get rid of gordon for me when you see him in the lobby tell him i'm staying in my room for the evening then i'll phone luis's room and we'll steal away to the lakeside casino for a few dances beverly hesitated and her mother reading her thoughts urged her please dear i'll enjoy it so i'll probably never see him again and i promise not to drink more than two cocktails all right mother i'll do it promised beverly she felt a cer- tain pleasure in the thought that though she did not relish the decep- tion it would enable her to have gordon to herself for a last few hours he was not in the lobby when beverly stepped from the elevator sebastian was there however you are charming this evening miss fenwick he said bowing his gaze traveled over her lithe form in its close-fitting gown of jade green you are like a goddess of the dance all green and gold beverly smiled coldly she did not like his bold eyes they made her feel creepy mother has not come down yet she informed him abruptly she is still in her room he smirked complacently as if there were some secret understand- ing between them then he bowed and left the lobby a moment later gordon sauntered in her heart leaped at his ap- proach being confined to your room has improved your looks if that were possible he smiled golden hair -green gown- blue eyes reflecting the green i call it bewitching where sebastian's compliments had repelled her gordon's words caused her to glow with inner hap- piness you're looking quite fit your- self she said how you stand up  street amp smith's love story magazine under bridge and other indoor ath- letics i don't know are you going to start that again he groaned his eyes went past her to the elevators how is your mother this evening this query set beverly's teeth on edge and are you going to start that now suppose i ask about your parents then we'll inquire after each other's grandparents and settle down to a cozy chat about the civil war you're a brat he muttered but there was a touch of embarrass- ment in his manner that made her take pity on him mother asked me to tell her pub- lic that she will stay in her room this evening she told him keeping as close to the truth as possible really his face lighted with apparent relief it puzzled her that was her message can i help you to kill a lonely evening at dominoes or checkers instead of being annoyed he- broke into laughter you have a lovely sense of hu- mor i like it he asserted let's declare a truce and go down to the grill and dance fine she accepted enthusiasti- cally they danced until near midnight the hours passed like a roseate rap- turous dream to beverly at last she had gordon all to herself he proved a delightful companion a perfect one she thought for she was gloriously completely in love with him and she admitted it to herself without reservation and it seemed to her that his feeling toward her was more than casual a man reveals so much when he looks in a certain way at a girl keeps his eyes on her alone trembles when his hand touches hers as the evening wore on they became a little graver a little shyer with each other as if deep emotions were surging within them let's take a turn in the air he suggested finally they went out to the terrace and around to the deserted porch of the hotel an intimate silence fell be- tween them as they gazed out over the moonlit waters of the lake i wonder what is at the end of that moonglade beverly mused at last is it like a rainbow do you think he looked at the long path of sil- ver stretching to the horizon no there's no pot of gold there i'll tell you what i think if we could reach the moonglade's end we'd find the answer to our dreams what would yours be she met his glance intently chal- lenging i hope you won't laugh she said what i'd want to find there would be just a home just a home he stared in sur- prise yes it needn't be a big one nor a grand one but a home a real home you see mother and i travel from hotel to hotel she loves it but i'm deathly tired of it so i'dream of a home of my own she was really afraid he might be amused but he looked at her with deepening approval and his voice was tender when he spoke i like that he declared a home but wouldn't you want some one to share it with you bev- erly he was gazing intently at her a strange timidity assailed her and she could not raise her eyes to his how could she let him read what was so plainly written there you're asking too many ques- tions she parried suppose you answer one what dream would you ls f young and beautiful  she clutched at his arm almost frantically gordon i don't understand you she cried what can it matter to you if my mother is out with luis sebastian but gordon freed his arm and ran to his car hope to find answered at the end of the moonglade it was his turn to display a sort of shyness the answer to my dream his voice was hesitant but vibrant with rising emotion well- a sudden gust of wind came from the lake and beverly pulled her wrap closer about her his hands went out to help her she felt his fingers trembling at her shoulders as his hands hovered reluctant to draw away almost insensibly she swayed toward him then his arms went about her and he drew her to him and held her close she raised her eyes to his and then swiftly crushingly his lips were on hers he kissed her again and again as though he could never have enough she returned his kisses afloat in a warm sea of lan- guorous delight athrill with the con- ls f  street amp smith's love story magazine tented rapture of love given and returned at last breathless she drew back with a smile and a faint shake of her head now she wanted to have him speak to put his endearments into words he gazed down at her his eyes melting into hers that's the answer to my dreams darling he began you in my arms and- footsteps behind them made him pause beverly drew away from him as some one came up the steps it was the young assistant manager of the hotel oh good evening miss fen- wick he murmured and mr larrimore how are you he looked fully as embarrassed as they over having interrupted their tête-à-tête trying to ease the situa- tion he paused and turned just be- fore he entered the lobby i saw that charming mother of yours at the casino he said to beverly she was certainly enjoy- ing herself then he left them blissfully igno- rant of having hurled a verbal bomb- shell gordon's manner underwent a complete change he looked at bev- erly accusingly his brows knitting together i thought you said your mother was staying in her room that's what she wanted me to say explained beverly but in- stead she went to the lakeside casino with- with sebastian he burst out and she nodded wondering at his vehemence then to her greater astonishment he started across to- ward the steps bewildered she clutched- at his arm almost frantically gordon i don't understand you she cried her voice breaking what can it matter to you what my mother does if- but with an impatient shake of his head he freed his arm and fairly ran down the steps and around the drive toward the hotel garage two minutes later he roared past the porch in his roadster the sound of his motor died away in the direc- tion of the casino beverly moving as in a dream went down the steps and gazed blankly after him so rapidly had shock followed shock that she was still dry-eyed hurt to numbness so he had made love to her only in the absence of her mother and the moment he had learned where her mother was he had flung off after her great sobs began to shake the girl's slender body like a wounded thing she wandered into the hotel garden and flinging herself upon a bench gave way to her heartbreak and humiliation half an hour later her grief mo- mentarily spent beverly rose wea- rily from the bench she entered the hotel by a rear door not want- ing any one to see her stricken face and swollen eyelids she found herself in the unlighted sun parlor off this room a rear staircase led to the upper floors she was moving across the room feeling her way when two persons entered at the side door from the porch she drew back into the shadows the porch light fell on the pair who had come in her mother and se- bastian she smiled bitterly at the realization that gordon had evi- dently missed them then she drew in her breath sharply as she saw that her mother was walking a little un- steadily i feel funny said mrs fen- young and beautiful  wick pausing near the door what was in that last cocktail i drank luis nothing that wasn't good for you sebastian assured her suavely perhaps you'd best sit down a sec- ond he assisted mrs fenwick to a chaise longue her head sank back she murmured something then sank into deep slumber with quick catlike movements sebastian bent over her and re- moved the pearl necklace from her throat he was hurrying toward the door when beverly stepped from the shadows just a minute mr sebastian where do you think you are going with those pearls startled he wheeled toward her at the same instant his hand flashed up pointing a revolver at her oh it's you miss fenwick kindly don't raise your voice or i with quick movements sebastian removed the pearl necklace from mrs fenwick's throat then beverly stepped from the shadows just a minute mr sebastian where do you think you are going with those pearls  street amp smith's love story magazine shall have to do something regret- table just turn your back to me and put both hands behind you there was no mistaking the steely menace in his low tones beverly did as he ordered hastily he tore some pull cords from the window drapes and tied her hands and feet then he turned her around to gag her with a handkerchief behind him she saw suddenly a man's form blocking the doorway her heart gave a leap as she rec- ognized gordon the next moment he sprang across the intervening space and hurled his six feet of weight and muscle upon sebastian sebastian struggled fiercely but once the revolver was wrested from his grasp he was at the mercy of the stronger man by the time ho- tel attendants rushed to the scene gordon had his opponent down beverly sighed and then did a sur- prising thing for a healthy athletic girl she quietly fainted it was the following morning in the sitting room of the fenwicks suite you see explained gordon my father is president of the zenith insurance co i'm a member of the firm in charge of the operatives- the detectives who investigate jewel thefts i begin to see said beverly her eyes were shining as she watched him pace the room while he talked i came here for a few days rest he went on then i saw this fellow sebastian hanging around your mother i recognized him as a man we had had under suspicion in a recent robbery so what could i do your mother's jewels were insured by our company it be- came my duty to stick close to her and sebastian i couldn't arrest him until he did something crimi- nal so that's why you left me she murmured right in the middle of- of telling you i loved you yes i knew your mother was in danger and there was no time to lose i reached the casino after she and sebastian had left trailed them back here and caught him red-handed he came across the room now and took her hands in his looking down at her-tenderly may i go on where i left off darling and tell you that i love you adore you want you that from the moment i saw you i knew you were the answer to all my dreams i want to hear it all she breathed over and over again but first hold me tight and kiss me he took her in his arms and she gave herself up utterly to the sweet delicious rapture of his kiss a voice behind them finally broke in upon their blissful oblivion you make a sweet couple said - mrs fenwick from the doorway she came toward them smilingly how disillusioned i was she continued lightly thinking two young men were fascinated by me when one wanted my pearls and the other only wished to protect me oh mother don't you mind ex- claimed beverly embracing her sympathetically no sympathy needed my dear i'm cured i've just accepted my lawyer's proposal of marriage over the telephone we'll have a gorgeous double wedding beverly midnight madness by  joan king a serial - part iv chapter vii janice woke and lay gazing at the pale shaft of sunlight strug- gling in between the drawn satin damask curtains of her bed- room windows at first sleep still lay heavy on her lids misting her brain then memory flooded back last night had been the night of the play and the supper dance had she dreamed it or had that scene in her husband's room really happened she closed her eyes and lay breathing quickly her hands pressed against her madly beating heart she could hear again the murmur of her husband's voice whispering his love could feel the pressure of his arms as they held her the throb of his kisses oil her throat against her lips she had believed that she would give years of her life to know that he loved her for one hour and she had had her hour of ecstasy she had taken the love which was  street amp smith's love story magazine hers by right yet the love she had taken had been meant for another girl because of the remains of the fe- ver that was upon him and the drugs he had been obliged to take during the day he had mistaken her for gina mornington what would he think if he ever found out the truth she had been mad- mad yet the memory of that madness thrilled her from head to foot and she knew that no matter what price she paid she would never really regret if out of all her life she was to have no more than that one hour at least it could never be taken from her but she was bit- terly ashamed when she thought of what the man she loved would think of her if he ever knew he must never know she was determined on that point but how was she going to face him she prayed that he might be remaining in his room that day anyhow until she had more time to collect her courage presently the maid brought her morning coffee explaining that she served it late as she knew that janice must have been very tired the night before janice bade the girl draw her bath but she was very slow get- ting dressed and finally ordered breakfast to be brought up to her own room somehow she dreaded going down that morning even though she believed that her hus- band was still in his room but when she did go down she opened the library door and saw her husband seated at his desk looking through some papers he still looked ill but the signs of fever had gone as he glanced up and saw her he gave a start hello janice he exclaimed how did everything go she noticed for the first time his eyes did not meet hers and her heart missed a beat it needed a great effort to make her voice sound steady as she moved for- ward everything went off very success- fully thanks she replied but i don't think that you ought to be downstairs you were very ill yester- day he made an im- patient movement i've had attacks like that before i can shake them off if there is anything i loathe it is staying in my bedroom i am all right to-day- except that my head- is a little woozy from so much qui- nine she turned away and looked out of the window well you know best how you feel yourself she replied i must go into town this morning can i do anything for you while i'm down there he hesitated the story so far jan- ice temple out of a job is returning to her home town when on the train she meets roger greville who has just been jilted by his fiancee gina mornington hating to tell his father who has never seen gina what has happened he persuades janice to pose as his fiancee for a month roger's father has a stroke and before he dies he begs roger to marry janice after the old man's death roger insists that they pretend that they are happily married he also forbids her to continue her friendship with sefton arlen a neighbor friend roger and janice become good friends and janice hopes that roger is learning to love her when gina mornington returns determined to win roger for herself roger comes down with an attack of fever and janice is with him when he takes her in his arms and kisses her telling her he loves her but calling her gina midnight madness  if you don't mind leaving a package with lawrence amp nye's he said there are some papers they wanted my signature to lawrence amp nye were the family lawyers janice was glad that she really had an excuse to go into the town for apart from his errand she had nothing to do there at all but she felt that she could not stay indoors could not bear to be alone with roger lest she should betray herself she loved him so much and in spite of everything she was less than nothing to him the knowledge was double torture now when she had gone he sat star- ing in front of him his hands clenched he too was tortured- tortured by uncertainty which if it were turned into certainty he felt would be still greater agony but he told himself it couldn't be true gina mornington could not have come to him last night the memo- ries which haunted him were just a dream he reached for a book and open- ing it tried to read but he could not do so all the time a girl's face came between him and the printed page it was not the face of the girl he believed he loved but of the girl whom he had made his wife he shut the book impatiently why should he be so strangely haunted by janice why should he imagine that there was something different about her to-day as though her beauty had intensified and at the same time taken on a hint of tragedy which it had not held be- fore could it be possible that she cared for sefton arlen it was strange how the thought disturbed him yet she was noth- ing to him nothing a dark flush stained his cheek she was a girl whose life he had taken and used for his own ends and however much he might tell himself that she had benefited by the change in her circumstances his sense of justice and his sense of honor both told him that she de- served more than he had given her suddenly he found himself re- membering the strange attraction which she had held for him that kiss with which he had claimed his bride at his father's bedside that night when he had paced beneath her window and felt the strength of his emotions like a magnet drawing him to her it seemed years ago now all that part of his life appeared to have been cut away by the arrival of gina mornington suppose gina mornington had not come back would he have learned to love the girl whom he had mar- ried but he told himself impatiently that love comes only once in a life- time- real love- and that he had given to gina mornington he rose impatiently and walking across to the desk helped himself to a cigarette from the box which stood upon it but after one or two puffs he flung it into the fire he crossed the room and sat down on a couch near one of the long french windows while he sat there staring discon- tentedly into space he heard a girl's voice outside the door and turned his head quickly as it opened ex- pecting to see janice but the girl who stood smiling at him from the threshold was gina mornington you're not to get up she ex-  street amp smith's love story magazine claimed as he would have risen and reaching his side pressed him back into his seat i was determined to come and find out how you were and when the butler told me you were downstairs i insisted on com- ing in and annoucing myself she seated herself beside him looking janice closed her eyes and lay breathing quickly her hands pressed against her madly beating heart she could hear again the murmur of her hus- band's voice could feel the pressure of his arms the throb of his kisses midnight madness  anxiously into his face i was so terribly worried i felt that i sim- ply had to come and see how you were to-day my dear i'm all right he told her a touch of restraint in his voice she made no reply suddenly as their eyes met he bent toward her gina he said his hand closing over her wrist last night- where were you what do you mean she asked and something she could not define stopped her from saying more as she gazed into his troubled face he released her passing one hand over his eyes last night i had a strange dream he told her i was alone in my room and had fallen asleep by the fire suddenly i woke up and you were there bending over me you and i were there alone i could have sworn when i woke up this morning that it was true as she listened her heart began to beat quickly with excitement she was fond of pretending to be of the helpless clinging type the type which she believed appealed most to men but in reality she had a brain which was as keen as a man's she could grasp a thing in an instant now she saw what a chance his uncertainty gave her of getting the hold over him for which she had longed the color flooded her face and then receded leaving her deathly pale with excitement for a moment longer her eyes held his then the heavily lashed lids fluttered down veiling them from his sight she spoke hardly above her breath and yet every word she ut- tered fell clearly on the stillness roger she murmured her voice making a passionate caress of his name my dear suppose it was no dream but a reality what are you saying he asked hoarsely how could you have been here don't you know the old proverb -that love laughs at locksmiths she asked i knew you were alone she slipped to her knees beside him my dearest don't you understand i knew you were alone -something stronger than myself forced me to run the risk to come to you you won't blame me be- cause my love for you was so strong even though our love must always remain a secret i do not care to know that i belong to you is the greatest joy in the world and noth- ing can take that from me kneeling beside him she reached up her arms and putting them about his neck drew his face down to hers mechanically his arm went about her shoulders but he was aware of no quickening pulse beat no thrill from the nearness of this girl the very thought of whom had once had the power to set him ablaze he had a strange feeling of numb- ness as though he had received a stunning blow and he looked blankly at the lovely alluring face so close to his then his brain cleared as though a great shaft of light had pierced it at that moment he knew that whatever he had felt in the past for this girl he did not and never had really loved her the glamour of her spell was dead he did not know where the knowledge came from he dared not ask he only knew that his discov- ery had come too late janice turned in at the lodge gates and saw a car a few yards ahead on its way to the house  street amp smith's love story magazine to her annoyance she recognized it as sefton arlen's reaching the curve in the drive she would have turned off in the direction of the garage hoping to miss the visitor when he stopped his car and getting out hailed her she was obliged to stop i've just come to pick up gina mornington he told her i prom- ised that i would pick her up and drive her back as i'm lunching at the chelmsfords where she is staying janice felt suddenly cold but under the coldness her hatred for the other girl smoldered fiercely do you know her well she managed to say yes she and i met two or three years ago when i was abroad he answered and as they turned and walked to- ward the house to- gether he gave her a sharp look in spite of her effort to hide it some of her hatred for the other girl had crept into her voice your husband and gina are old friends i believe he observed cas- ually janice's hands clenched but she managed to keep her voice quite steady as she replied yes i believe they are rounding the corner of the house they reached the steps which led up to the terrace and longing to end the interview janice began to mount them saying that they would go in that way if roger is still in the library he can let us in she added a few more steps brought her to the first of the library windows the curtains were drawn back and any one standing outside could see straight into the room it was im- possible for them not to see those two within- the girl kneeling with her arms around the man's neck- and it was at that precise moment that roger greville placed his own arm around gina mornington's shoulders for a moment janice stood as though turned to stone then forgetful of the fact that she was not alone she turned and walked blindly away reaching the para- pet she gripped it and stood gazing downinto the gardens below see- ing nothing but a red mist and in the center of it those two- her husband and the girl he loved suddenly sefton ar- len spoke beside her surely janice you are not going to endure that sort of thing her need to speak to ease some of the pain in her overcharged heart was so great that she forgot the identity of her companion they were engaged to be mar- ried she said dully his eyes flashed understandingly i know he nodded and they quarreled that was how you caught him on the rebound you're curiously like her every one has noticed that my dear girl- his hand closed on hers- don't you know that she is not the sort to let go her grip on any man who has once cared for her she is dan- gerously fascinating surely you're not going to allow yourself to be midnight madness  made a laughingstock if they want each other let them see that they are welcome you must real- ize that you won't suffer you have a career at your finger tips what do you mean she asked i've watched you at every re- hearsal and last night you simply amazed me you're a born actress if you'd like to leave roger greville i'll find you a decent job without the slightest difficulty why not let me help you you are very good but at pres- ent i have no intention of going away i think we had better go in now the other way he laid a hand on her arm de- taining her promise me one thing he begged if ever you do want help promise that you will look on me as your friend and let me help you there was such a ring of sincerity in his voice that janice forgot all she had heard about him and felt a thrill of gratitude after all it was good to think that somebody really cared yes i'll remember she prom- ised and thank you as arlen followed her his heart was beating with a new hope were the fates going to be good to him would they help him to win this girl whom he wanted more than he had ever wanted anything in the world janice paced the floor of her bed- room like some caged thing the silence of the house mocked her with memories it was not twenty-four hours since she had stolen through the silence to arms which had only taken her because they believed they held another girl too late now she saw what the consequences of that stolen hour would be- that by her own act she had forged an unbreakable tie be- tween the man she loved and gina mornington she could not think clearly her knowledge of the love between those two threw her mind into chaos at first she had meant to tell her husband what she had seen through the library window but she had found that she dared not do it lest she should betray her own love for him for she felt that she would rather die than have him guess that she cared but she dared not stay here she could not suddenly she made up her mind she would go away now leave the house this very night and he should not know where she had gone let him explain her absence as best he could let him suffer some of the humiliation that was hers she told herself that she hated him and wished with all her heart that it was true she had been waiting for the moon to rise for she would have to walk to the junction four miles away in order to catch the early-morning train to town as she moved across the room to the window and drew aside the cur- tain she saw that the moon was just coming up over the tops of a clump of fir trees turning back into the room she looked around at the luxury she was leaving the brief note of farewell she had written to the man she had mar- ried lay on the dressing table the one suitcase which she was taking with her stood ready packed near the bed she picked up her heavy coat and put it on opening the door she paused to switch off the light and  street amp smith's love story magazine it was impossible for them not to see those two within for a moment janice stood as though turned to stone then forgetful of the fact that she was not alone she turned and walked blindly away picking up her suitcase made her way out into the darkened corridor five minutes later she let her- self out a side door and shutting it silently behind her sped away into the shadows midnight madness  once she paused and looked back at the great gray pile of the old house- the place where she had learned that love and suffering so often mean the same thing to a girl there was no hope in her heart as she turned and walked blindly out of the life of the man she loved with a love whose bitterness was akin to hatred it had been very late before roger greville went to bed that night and then there was no sleep for him hour after hour he lay staring wide-eyed into the darkness he was like a man who fears a locked door inside which he is afraid to look his infatuation for gina morn- ington was dead he felt that he hated her  street amp smith's love story magazine he had married janice against his will he had no love to offer her but he would never have deliberately broken the vows he made to her he believed that he had neither given nor claimed anything from her but he had never meant to hurt her dawn was long past when he fell into an uneasy sleep and it seemed as though he had slept only a few moments when he was awakened by a hurried knocking on his door and in answer to his sleepy call a maid came in oh sir she cried i've just been to madam's room her bed hasn't been slept in and i found this she held out an envelope as she spoke with a queer feeling at his heart he ripped open the envelope a moment later he was staring down at the slip of paper in his hand i am going away janice had written you will realize that the best thing for us both is to end our marriage as he read those lines and knew that she was gone he knew that he loved the girl whom he had mar- ried a groan of anguish broke from him had he learned the truth too late chapter viii janice sat on the edge of the nar- row bed in the room which she had engaged in a quiet hotel in the east fifties it was all unspeakably drab- the walls with their faded paper the dressing table on which the scarf was not quite clean the dingy net curtains at the window only half veiling the dull sky beyond how different it all was from the surroundings which had been hers in roger greville's home she had determined to try to get work on the stage remembering what sefton arlen had said to her but she was equally determined not to seek his help for she felt that he was the sort of man whose friend- ship meant danger to any girl besides she wanted to be inde- pendent one of the girls who used to work with her had been on the stage and from her janice had heard about theatrical agents through whom it was possible to obtain stage work as soon as she had breakfasted she purchased a weekly theatrical paper searching the columns of the paper for what she wanted she found the names and ad- dresses of several agents and se- lected one which was not far away but when she reached the open doorway inside which a narrow stair- case led upward to the agent's office her courage almost deserted her climbing the stairs she entered the waiting room and her heart sank again as she saw the number of people who were already there she sat down nervously aware that every one was staring at her and there followed the most uncom- fortable ten minutes she had ever known in her life if she had had the courage to do so she would have got up and gone out and she was just trying to sum- mon it to her aid when an inner door opened and a small dark man came out he was accompanied by a taller gray-haired man and the two of them walked to the door ten gether and as they parted the former turned and caught sight of janice he paused and stared at her tell me he demanded where midnight madness  do you come from and why haven't i seen you before somehow there was something about him which she instinctively liked and it gave her courage can i see mr whitehouse she asked yes he answered good-na- turedly unless those lovely eyes of yours are quite blind from his words she gathered that this was the agent arnold white- house himself five minutes later she was sitting opposite him in his private office ex- plaining to him her desire to obtain work on the stage he listened until she had finished i suppose you realize he told her that you haye got a tre- mendous nerve you come here having had no professional experi- ence whatever and demand a job in the most overcrowded of all the pro- fessions and the most difficult to break into what makes you think that you can act she hesitated because i was told so by a man who really knows she finally con- fessed he offered to help me but i don't want him to do so the agent raised his brows he could understand that quite a lot of men would be willing to help such a lovely girl it was her beauty which had made him notice her just now and he was used to lovely girls he drew a big ledger toward him and picking up a pen asked a few brief businesslike questions noting down the answers then he rose and held out his hand well frankly miss er- he began i forgot to ask your name janice hesitated then she remem- bered that her mother's maiden name was darling and gave him that with her own christian name janice darling he repeated as he wrote it down well miss dar- ling i don't hold out much hope of being able to do anything for you but if you care to stop in the office every day i'll keep you in mind if anything turns up with that she had to be content but though for the next ten days she visited the office every day she never received anything but the same greeting one which she heard given to dozens of other girls ab- solutely nothing to-day my dear she also tried other agents with the same disappointing results until she began to lose heart her visit to the agents took up only a small part of the day and there was all the rest in which to think and worst of all the long hours of the night for she slept badly and when she did sleep it was to dream of roger greville try as she would to forget she could not put him out of her mind she knew that the time would come when she would have to com- municate with him for if their mar- riage was to be dissolved he would have to know where she was but she didn't want to let him know until she got work and could prove to him that she was independent one day driven by an uncon- trollable impulse she climbed on top of a fifth avenue bus and from her seat she looked down again at the spot where she had first encoun- tered roger greville the bus stopped in front of the jeweler's shop and as she gazed down it seemed to janice as though she was once again the plainly dressed girl who had found herself suddenly looking into a man's eyes she knew now the meaning of the surge of emotion which had quick- ened all her pulses  street amp smith's love story magazine that day she went to arnold whitehouse's office in the afternoon as she entered the waiting room the office door was flung wide open and he came out and beckoned to his secretary who was talking to a golden-haired girl as he turned back he caught sight of janice and paused to speak to her nothing to-day he told her and then added in a lower voice but if you'll be in promptly at eleven to-morrow morning i may be able to fix you up i don't prom- ise but there is just a chance she thanked him and as he went back into his office and she left the waiting room there was new hope in her heart she got halfway down the stairs toward the street when she heard footsteps descending behind her and a voice called to her she turned to find the agent's secretary close to her holding out an envelope mr whitehouse said that if you would go to this address at once with this letter there is a chance you might get something right away before janice could reply the secretary had turned and was gone janice glanced down at the en- velope in her hand the flap was sealed down and it was addressed to mr paige rendell star thea- ter and marked urgent less than a quarter of an hour later janice found herself entering the stage door of the star theater and in reply to the inquiry of the doorkeeper she showed him the letter he sent a boy who was in the office with it bidding him take that to mr rendell in a short time the boy came back asking janice to follow him she never forgot the interview which followed and when she left the theater she could hardly believe that she had actually been hired by one of the most famous producers in new york to play a part in the play which was then in rehearsal the girl who had been originally engaged for the part had been taken ill that morning and it was difficult to find a girl to fill her place janice happened to be the exact type needed for the part which though it was not a large one was very im- portant when she confessed to having had no real experience the producer merely nodded that doesn't matter i am sure that you will be all right he told her janice had never known what real nervousness meant until she stood on the deserted stage at the star at eleven o'clock the next morning she had never believed that any ordeal could be so terrible and it was only sheer will power which stopped her from failing several times paige rendell stopped her making her go over the piece again and each time as she caught the exact intonation he di- rected he gave a nod of approval he saw at once that she was a born actress and needed very little teach- ing at lunch time the rehearsal was dismissed until the afternoon and janice was just walking off the stage after the others when the producer called her back just a minute miss darling he said a gentleman here is very anxious to make your acquaintance or rather renew it for i understand that you have met before an immaculately dressed figure had just strolled out of the shadows and janice felt her heart miss a beat ls f midnight madness  janice was just walking off the stage when the producer called her back a gentleman here is very anxious to make your acquaintance or rather renew it for i understand that you have met before he said for the man who stood holding out his hand and smiling down at her was sefton arlen it is more than good to meet again taking her hand and re- taining it sefton arlen glanced at ls f  street amp smith's love story magazine the producer well my dear ren- dell wasn't i right when i guaran- teed that ja- that miss darling was a born actress the other man nodded withdrawing her hand janice gave sefton arlen a swift startled look what do you mean you- she began i happened to be in arnold whitehouse's office yesterday and i caught sight of you and sent a letter of introduction to our friend paige rendell so it had been through sefton arlen after all that she had ob- tained an engagement the knowledge brought with it deep disappointment which janicie found it difficult to hide if he guessed what was in her mind sefton arlen gave no sign ever since he knew that she had left her husband he had searched for her and had almost despaired of finding her but now he felt that his luck had turned let's go and have some lunch he said there are a good many things i want to talk to you about janice hesitated but it seemed that it would be too ungracious to refuse and so less than a quarter of an hour later she found herself sitting opposite him in a well-known restaurant near the theater looking across at her sefton ar- len felt his pulses quicken it seemed to him that janice had changed in some indescribable way the vividness of her beauty had somehow deepened there were dark-violet shadows beneath her eyes and a hint of tragedy about her face in repose she had been worrying he thought and a sharp stab of jeal- ousy shot through him he was amazed to find that he was capable of jealousy and he could not understand the strange in- fluence which this girl seemed to have established over his life love to him had never been more than a pastime he was used to easy conquests and enjoyed flit- ting like a bee from flower to flower but he had known vaguely from his first meeting with janice that the attraction she held for him was something different now tell me he demanded where have you been hiding your- self and why you knew that i could help you why were you so independent she flushed i didn't want to bother you she said we'll let it go at that i think -in case i hear something less flat- tering but what sort of engage- ment did you contemplate obtain- ing the only sort of work white- house could have gotten for you was a place in the chorus where the fact that you are so very ornamental would have offset your lack of ex- perience thank heaven that i've found you and that you were wise enough to leave home when you did she made no reply and he was content to steer the conversation away from her private affairs he could be a very charming and amusing companion and for the first time in many days janice found herself laughing and forgetting a lit- tle of her heartache this meeting with sefton arlen made her realize more than ever how intensely lonely she had been and she could not help being a little glad that her loneliness was at an end after all it was good to feel that some one took an interest in what happened to her have you made up your mind midnight madness  what you intend to do he asked as the lunch was drawing to an end if you are to make a career for yourself it would be much better for you to be free you're in touch with greville i suppose she shook her head no i- i wanted to wait un- til-- you could prove that you were independent he finished for her well you're safe now if anything should happen to this play which however i believe will be a success i can always manage to see that you have work she gave him a level look why should you interest your- self so much in me it is very good of you but- i believe in you he broke in shortly if you really want to work i believe there is a big career in front of you i can't think why you never turned your thoughts to the stage before look here- he bent a little nearer to her- you must be sensible put roger gre- ville out of your mind altogether he isn't worth a second thought you have some pride haven't you should i be here if i hadn't she asked wearily you'd have been mad if you'd stayed to play second fiddle to gina mornington he retorted with brutal frankness you knew that they were engaged before he mar- ried you anyhow whether you free him or not she doesn't care she has him and she means to keep him janice's hand resting on her knee beneath the table clenched but she lifted her head with a reckless ges- ture you've seen her recently she asked a few days ago he hesitated they're in town going about everywhere together you'll have to do something about it janice yes she repeated dully i'll have to do something about it meanwhile though- he glanced at his watch- we had better be getting back to the theater until after the opening i want you to think as much of your part and as little about other things as you pos- sibly can you must make good janice i want you to and i want from you what i have never cared to ask from any girl before- i want your friendship surely you deserve that she told him as he followed her out of the restaurant sefton arlen was more puzzled about himself than he had ever been he talked of friendship but he knew that he wanted a great deal more than that he wanted to win her and make her his own if he failed he knew that noth- ing in life would ever be worth hav- ing again for the first time he was afraid of failure when roger greville realized that janice was gone he explained to the servants that his wife had been called away suddenly by the illness of a relative and within a few hours he himself had packed up and de- parted he had absolutely no idea of where janice could have gone he felt that she might have returned to new york and it was with the vague hope of finding her that he went there himself somehow he shrank from tracing her by the help of any of the de- tective agencies whose aid he might have called in it was his belief that he had for- feited his right to claim her to drag  street amp smith's love story magazine janice had made a success of her part in the play the day after the opening a photograph of janice darling smiled up at roger greville from the front page of the paper he had found his wife her back into his life if she wished to be free that held him back he stayed at his club and be- fore he had been there two days he was called to the telephone to hear gina mornington's voice demand- ing pleadingly why he had gone away without a word to her she too had come to new york and had taken a suite at one of the big hotels and she implored him to come to see her it seemed to him that he was bound in honor to go but sefton arlen had exaggerated when he told janice that her hus- midnight madness  band and gina mornington were being seen everywhere together as much as it was possible to do so roger greville avoided gina mornington and when she re- proached him for doing so told her that he had a lot of business to transact she accepted the explanation with a very bad grace but she did not suspect that he had changed toward her she believed she had won him back by a lucky chance- a chance which she believed to have been born out of an illusion of his delirium -she had bound him to her and she had gotten rid of janice of one thing she was determined that other girl should never come back into his life though the pres- ent arrangement didn't suit her at all roger greville refused to discuss his wife with her and gina did not know if he was aware of janice's whereabouts or not but she wanted the thing put on a definite footing when the time came for the pro- duction of exiled hearts at the star theater janice faced her or- deal bravely she was determined to succeed she had so much at stake although the part she was play- ing was not a big one it was very important and she made the suc- cess of the play the critics were unanimous in ac- claiming janice darling a find she had beauty talent and what was more important that elusive thing known as personality and in her one big scene she brought the house down she was a success the next day there were photo- graphs of her in all the papers and when roger greville sat down to his breakfast a photograph of janice darhng smiled up at him from the front page he had found his wife to be concluded enchanted garden walk in a garden enchanted whenever i think of you- a garden of

men except here in the office and it just happened that none were very desirable- except harvey  street amp smith's love story magazine tate and he had never asked her for a date wasn't that irony for you the one man who could have qualified wasn't interested he was inside talking with mr london now and on his way out he'd probably stop as usual and ask her to be sure to put through the papers on the pur- chases from his company then he'd chat for a couple of minutes in a way that would show he could be fascinating for hours and that would be all he was coming out now strolling toward her they're getting another order of those tumblers he said and- i know and you want me to put it through right away all right he laughed there was a quiet heartiness about his laughter har- monizing with the strength and re- straint of his face which seemed more tanned than ever in contrast with the white flash of his teeth merrilee had a faint sense of life speeding up in her veins as he paused at her desk you read my thoughts so well he observed i'm almost afraid to think in your presence his conversation in the fleeting minutes while it lasted was always just personal enough to give the illu- sion of being only a part of a larger friendship it made merrilee feel al- most as if she really knew him i wonder if you'd do me a favor - she stopped herself what on earth was she saying on an in- stant's crazy impulse she had almost asked him to help her gladly what is it he urged she hesitated almost panic- stricken she had to say something or he'd think her silly the wild -impulse of a moment before seized her again it's a strange thing to ask i need an escort she heard herself saying she could feel the hot blush on her face i want to play a sort of joke on a friend of mine you're just the type of man she likes she declared with inspiration that amazed herself the other men i've been dating here in new york aren't as likely to make her jealous for a moment he did not reply standing with a puzzled grin the color deepening under his tan now it was he who was embarrassed it helped merrilee recapture her poise also she was relieved and pleased at what she had said about dating other men and making her friend jealous the idea had come to her out of nowhere i'm sure you'll like nola wil- liams too she continued suavely she's really beautiful- tall and blond she was about to add and very wealthy but decided that it would have the wrong effect it's wednesday night will you help me she asked isn't it a pretty difficult assign- ment- he grinned uncertainly trying to make some girl jealous i think you're capable oh and of course she added with sudden positiveness i'll pay my own share of the expenses it will be strictly business at least that part of it will fifty-fifty his gray eyes surveyed her with a smile she could not quite interpret all right he laughed but it's your own idea merrilee dressed and made up more carefully than she had since the first month she had been in new york her dress was of deep-green that seemed to bring out her color the flush of her cheeks the deep- brown of her eyes the somewhat lighter soft brown of her hair she had arranged the hair to curve borrowed man  i wonder if you'd do me a favor i need an escort she could feel the hot blush on her face i want to play a sort of joke on a friend of mine partly over her ears instead of in the simple little-girl style she al- ways wore at the office she laughed at herself such a lot of attention to trifles when harvey came he seemed surprised and pleased at her appear- ance she realized he hadn't seen her that way before your usual charm he smiled is more notice- able than ever the remark was just a bit of pleasantry but merrilee flushed with a little ripple of excitement they went up to nola's apart- ment nola in shimmering blue met them with a bright exclamation of pleasure and led them in to the already merry group merrilee felt a little shiver of ex- citment everybody seemed nice the girls were pretty the men at- tractive merrilee couldn't help noticing how smoothly harvey tate seemed to fit in with the others and yet seemed to have some subtly superior quaility which without caus- ing offense still set him above them he brought her a cocktail remain- ing delightfully attentive he was playing his part beautifully when they went to the dance at  street amp smith's love story magazine the cloudline club harvey guided her about the glazed floor in lithe strong rhythm so suavely attuned to the music that his steps might have been written by the composer as a part of the score he danced with nola and the others always returning to lead merrilee off for another number she was deliciously aware of the pressure of his arm around her the steel of his shoulder beneath her touch the nearness of his bronzed face brushing lightly against her hair she let herself think for a mo- ment how wonderful it is just to be with this man then with a wrench of will power she dragged her thoughts to reality these thrills were borrowed harvey tate had only lent himself to her as a favor when they finally went home harvey and she in some way became separated from nola and her escort taking a taxicab to themselves merrilee sat back with her eyelids half lowered aware of harvey's smiling nearness yet feeling dread- fully like cinderella at the approach of midnight when borrowed happi- ness would be snatched away she was suddenly rebellious at that thought i wish harvey was saying whimsically that doing favors for people were always as pleasant as this has been i hope you'll be able to help me out once more her words came on a sudden impulse but the tone was casual i promised nola i'd go with her on the eighteenth will you take me you know just to round out the impression with quick strategy which surprised her she added to-night worked out so beautifully having you as a date made just the right impression on her why all right consented har- vey with that odd smile which she could not interpret at her first opportunity she spoke to nola what are you doing the eight- eenth why nothing oh yes that's a wednesday i have a date with dick mills at first she didn't think a double date could be arranged i have a kind of tentative en- gagement with harvey said merri- lee nola's face lighted quickly- too quickly maybe we can fix it she said i'll call dick next day she reported it's all right we're just going to the danube you come too the danube was a colorful but serene place where the orchestra skillfully alternated gay sweet straus's waltzes with the best of the latest tunes again merrilee was in harvey's arms dancing and again life seemed to be moving faster through her veins because of his nearness there was a thrill of being touched by his hand in being held close against him as they danced merrilee found herself wishing his arms were around her in a real em- brace wishing she were crushed close against him to be kissed even the thought made her heart pound she was in love with him it seemed odd that she should just be realizing it all at once this way she must have been in love with him for days maybe for weeks she looked up at his face close to hers did he care too his eyes met hers and her nerves tingled borrowed man  with an embarrassed but delightful warmth his arm tightened about her surely he cared- a little anyway -maybe more than a little well she would know on the way home to-night perhaps as they returned to their table merrilee felt a surge of gratitude to nola if it hadn't been for her she might never really have known harvey she almost wanted to throw her arms around nola's neck and thank her instead she smiled at her and exclaimed nola you're simply gorgeous in that dress isn't she beautiful harvey and dick mills agreed when the four finally trooped out of the danube all took the same cab it was the natural thing to do merrilee realized though she hadn't counted on it harvey was between nola and her and dick faced them from one of the folding seats nola and harvey had become en- gaged in some sort of banter prob- ably over something they had dis- cussed while dancing together oc- casionally it included the other two then something nola would address directly to harvey would claim his whole attention a sudden displeasure shot through merrilee it was akin to jealousy she resisted it telling herself it was stupid but as nola continued to usurp harvey's attention she burned with resentment in the foyer of their apartment building dick and harvey said good night with brief handshakes nola called after harvey laugh- ingly don't forget next tuesday all right he replied striding out a thousand needles pricked mer- rilee her heart seemed to leap to her throat and fall back with a thud in the elevator nola confided smiling we're going to have dinner at yesterday's tavern nice of him to ask you merri- lee replied she hadn't meant to speak sharply but something in her voice caused nola to explain it was a sort of mutual invita- tion i told him i'd heard of it but had never been there and he said he'd take me why do you mind i mean do you like him merrilee couldn't reply no words would fit oh of course you like him nola supplied with innocence in her blue eyes and real sincerity in her voice but i know you don't like him too much you can spare him you still have plenty of oth- ers he says so himself yes merrilee choked the elevator had stopped at her floor and the operator was waiting for her to leave she stepped out almost stumbling and hurried to the shelter of her apartment all the loneliness of her months in new york suddenly crushed in upon her happiness had come so close and passed her by she had had harvey tate's companionship just long enough to realize she loved him and then nola who always had everything she wanted got him too she couldn't blame nola though she had handed him to her she had virtually told them both to go ahead and care for each other what a mess she had made of her own happiness she thought dis- mally the next evening nola stopped at her door for a minute i was talking with harvey on  street amp smith's love story magazine the phone she said if you have a date tuesday why don't you come along with us oh no nola but thanks sorry merrilee said nola we just thought you might be hav- ing a date anyway and- oh nola's remark meant in- nocently enough had bruised her already wounded pride did they think she couldn't get another date well she could she'd show them both well i do have she said as if reconsidering i'll ask him if he wants to go to the tavern when nola had gone merrilee sat with hands clenched until her knuckles showed white trying to think of a suitable man jimmie keel wasn't really so bad he just hadn't interested her she'd told him she was awfully busy and he'd said he'd be glad to see her when she had time at the office next day when jimmie strolled in she smiled after a minute's conversation she ventured a remark that she wasn't quite so busy lately and- just like that- it was all arranged jimmie wasn't quite tall enough but he was really nice-looking and fairly interesting merrilee realized that she might have found him all right for an occasional evening be- fore if she hadn't unconsciously compared him with harvey tate that was what had happened she had met harvey on her third day at the office and since then no other man had seemed attractive the truth stabbed cruelly it hurt- more because she was aware of it too late tuesday evening was misery the four of them made a congenial group but nola exercised a sort of possessive claim on harvey's atten- tion it was so subtle and withal so natural that it could be felt rather than seen but it tore at the hurt in merrilee's heart sometimes for an instant merrilee met harvey's gaze deep in the gray of his eyes was that look she never could quite read it made her pulse throb faster arriving home at last was a re- lief good night said jimmie let's do this again soon fine responded merrilee but she knew she wouldn't it wasn't fair even to jimmie to use him this way and for herself it was only misery it was a relief that nola didn't ask her to come along when she went out with harvey the next week -a relief and torture she wasn't needed now they preferred to be alone merrilee sat in her apartment and tried to close her mind to the bitter- ness of her thoughts she tried to forget those few bright hours when she had been with harvey re- membering them only hurt she jumped to her feet and paced the floor as if in a desperate futile ef- fort to vent her emotions in some sort of action if only she could do something harvey came to the office to ar- range the details of an order his firm had received he paused be- side her desk leaning his bronzed hand against its edge smiling as he chatted merrilee felt a cheated yearning then a sudden rebellion against fate another of those curious unpre- meditated notions flashed through her mind in an instant she was acting on it concealing her impetu- piisness with amazing tact i was just thinking about you harvey she began carelessly another friend of mine from out of town is coming to-morrow and borrowed man  i wondered if you wouldn't help me again- just as a lark it worked out so well the first time you know for everybody concerned for a moment harvey didn't speak he gazed at her in uncer- tain silence as if trying to figure what she meant by that of course she added in a quick matter-of-fact way i'll pay my share of the expenses just as be- fore all right said harvey with a slow rather puzzled smile i know it'll be pleasant and by the way merrilee told him this girl isn't from milling- ham she's from central city she and nola don't know each other so you don't need to worry about that when he had gone merrilee sat almost trembling no he didn't need to worry but she did she had spun her web of pretense so thin drawn it out so far starting with a simple little fib about having a good time in new york she had stretched it until the most impor- tant part of her life seemed to be built on make-believe she was in near-panic but she couldn't turn back now at noon she had lunch with helen brodie helen i'm in an awful jam she confessed let's hear said helen her dark eyes sympathetic but twinkling i haven't forgotten what you did for me when tom thought i'd been two-timing him merrilee grinned in spite of her own troubles her friendship with helen was one of those whole- hearted dependable ones that per- sists even though circumstances make actual meetings rare she told her frankly what had happened what she had said to harvey tate i get it nodded helen i'm the friend from central city yes but don't you go falling for harvey too i'm warning you con- fidentially he's good-looking but he has a brother in prison he killed his first wife he's an habitual drunk- ard and he cheats newsboys sure helen agreed and if you get him i hope you'll reform him tom and i will be seeing you merrilee arranged the date for a saturday night starting out with harvey her heart beat with mo- mentary triumph and uneasy excite- ment her plan was daring wild this girl we're going to meet she said as they rode in the taxi thinks we're crazy about each other she forced herself to laugh merrily it's a shame to disap- point her too badly every girl said harvey sol- emnly should be helped to keep her illusions i'll do my best they met helen and tom at the cloudline club isn't it wonderful up here helen exclaimed i think new york is grand oh merrilee is mr tate the man you've been writ- ing me so much about  merrilee tried to blush and from the hot feeling of her cheeks thought she succeeded harvey had let his fingers touch hers and hold them lingeringly at their table he helped her to her seat with great tenderness his eyes hovered upon her hungrily and she returned the gaze with a thumping burning heart she had to be care- ful lest he see at once how real it was helen met her eyes and exchanged a surreptitious glance which harvey was intended to notice when they danced he held her close- closer than he really had to  street amp smith's love story magazine and once when helen and tom were near and he was sure they could see he let his lips brush her forehead with a gentle kiss it made her blood race with joy and pain oh if only that fleeting touch of a kiss had been meant in- stead of make-believe let's go out here a minute he suggested they were near an open doorway to the walled terrace harvey was he seized her in his arms held her crushed close against him kissed her soft yielding lips will you marry medarling he whispered borrowed man  playing his part well this was a natural thing for two lovers to do with his arm about her waist he led her out onto the terrace like a balcony in the sky overlooking the lamp-sprinkled darkness of the city in the distance was the river and the slowly moving lights of a boat boxed evergreens behind them screened them from the bright open doorway to the dance floor a sudden painful bit of logic flashed through merrilee's mind out here there was no need for harvey to act he couldn't be seen so he had come out for a respite but harvey apparently didn't re- alize his opportunity instead of taking his arm from her waist he tightened it until they faced each other he put his other arm around her suddenly held her close to him and pressed his lips against hers in a long deep kiss it was so deep so burning that for a moment it felt real and it took all her will power to hold her cool senses she tried desperately to speak lightly thank you sir but you don't have to do that helen can't see us here you can relax he released her from his arms his willingness to let her go when there was no need to hold her some- how scraped cruelly against her al- ready raw taut nerves before she realized it she had spoken again bitterly besides nola mightn't like it the instant the words were ut- tered she was sorry she hadn't put any pleasant bantering into her voice this time instead she had let it show that she was hurt now harvey would despise her but the look which came imme- diately to his face for some reason wasn't a look of disdain it was a look of astonishment then of par- tial understanding something like gladness hovered in his gray eyes i'll have to confess about nola he said slowly she's a very nice girl but i only dated her because -well look here merrilee your time was occupied with lots of other men i knew that from what nola told me and from what you said yourself i didn't want to pre- sume an our fifty-fifty business re- lationship you set the limits of it pretty clearly but i thought if i went out with nola now and then you'd be along and if i could only be around you more i still had a vague hope that- he hesitated merrilee put her handon his arm clasped it she looked up eagerly into his'gray eyes and the gladness that was hovering there seemed sud- denly to have lit them for they were glowing tenderly now you had a hope that what she urged him he seized her in his arms held her crushed close against him kissed her soft yielding lips i hoped he whispered that we could go on with our fifty-fifty plan with a slight change though i'll pay all the expenses you think up the ideas for games and things to pretend before your friends you think up all that sort of thing after we do one thing that i've thought up darling what is it dearest that we get married will you oh harvey dearest i thought that up long ago she murmured so did i the first time i went- out with you sweetheart he kissed her again even if they hadn't been on the lofty ter- race above the city's roofs above the river and its slowly moving lights she'd have felt that she was just as high carried by her joyous soaring heart orchid girl by  paula rockwell eve hilton last season's dar- ling of the stag line danced to-night professionally at the graysons charity garden fête the riotous applause of the socially prominent guests after her first dance assured her that she had caught on but her heart was a bottomless pit of anguish young doctor wallace had kept his word he hadn't come to her first public appearance her triumph in floating rose-shaded chiffons and filmy veils eve had drifted like a wraith blown by a breeze out of black tree shadows on the terrace to an improvised stage of green velvet turf her eyes searched vainly for that tall lithe figure the moon spread silvery whiteness over the ls f orchid girl  many rows of intimates in paris gowns and faultless evening clothes over the masses of flower beds shrubs and tinkling fountains in that silvery light on the soft wings of music from a hidden or- chestra eve danced like a spirit from another world a deep hush wild applause to music like a precious memory eve in white her hair sculptured gold danced a love call her love call to bob wallace danced the glory and miracle of woman's love for man danced until that blasé crowd rose and cheered but even when she stood sur- rounded by a worshiping group of friends even when a famous pro- ducer offered her a thrilling connec- tion with his broadway revue grief sheathed her in ice success with- out bob's love was salt on her lips well she'd go to new york work fiendishly succeed lovelessly then she saw him his back against a stately elm outlined in colored lights magnificent-looking in his black-and-white a fine- shaped head broad-shouldered with a gleaming smile that could melt a heart of iron but eve's heart wasn't iron it was clay for him to mold her heart was beating cra- zily loud now in her ears as she met his eyes with a silent appeal he bowed moved toward her then squared his shoulders and swung off toward the house he can't do that to me eve sobbed inwardly he must under- stand he shouldn't hate me now and avoid me like a plague i'm no longer a rich spoiled girl he must know i'm dancing to-night for my bread and butter she ran swiftly away to escape the gayly possessive friends and in spite of a gust of self-contempt- ls f she eve hilton running after any man- darted past the swimming pool to overtake that hurrying figure running fleetly she remembered that other night when her world had glistened goldenly at the house party of her cousin

as on an invisi- ble cord twenty-eight vitally pow- erful mouth resolute smelling pleas- antly of soap and antiseptic eve's heart thumped with a savage ex- citement she wondered what was happening to

drunkest drunk in our crowd eve knew she was playing with fire that night of the house party when she climbed the bluff over- hanging the lake on the arm of the handsome young doctor eve in a paris gown grimaced at herself as he braced her for the last steep ascent and said in a voice that was like a deep-toned carillon of bells the view's grand but you'll ruin your silver slippers and  street amp smith's love story magazine they must have cost you a whole week's salary so he thought her a working girl like most of the others at the house party laughing inwardly eve crushed the impulse to confess that she was the only child of john hilton in- ventor and multimillionaire and supposed to have been engaged in her cradle to that wealthy playboy cyril clarke i've seen you somewhere be- fore bob mused did you sell me some things in denton's base- ment no eve answered demurely but her eyes danced mischievously perhaps i waited on you in the five-and-ten on a rustic bench on the hilltop- eve and bob talked he spoke briefly of his hospital work shyly of his ambitions she said her mother had died when she was a tot but her father was a grand pal lately he hadn't seemed like him- self weak heart she worried suddenly eve was startled by a fierce new longing she ached to be held close in bob's arms let's go back and dance bob she suggested overcarelessly it's stuffy inside all that gang besides i don't dance haven't time work all day and sometimes all night she chattered to ease her wild longing ather says i danced be- fore i walked he let me have the best teachers paris petrograd but he always hoots when i say i'd dance for my supper if i ever had to earn my own- she stopped furious at her slip he stared at her for a painful moment his mouth rigid sorry he muttered you must think me an utter ass he lighted a ciga- rette but didn't smoke instead ground it fiercely under his heel of course you're eve hilton deb john hilton's daughter your pic- ture's forever in

struggling young doctor like me labeled dangerous- keep away the next instant she was swept roughly into his arms and her golden hair hardly reaching his shoulders she felt herself lifted on tiptoe he kissed her lips until they warmed under his he kissed her again and again not tenderly but fiercely until she hung limp in his arms let me go she stormed and orchid girl  had never known such gnawing pangs of fury even while in that electric moment her heart beat in her throat like a trapped bird every pulse in her body sang in the ecstasy of love she tore herself away and ran like the wind down the slope up the cottage steps- into lucile's arms i was just coming for you eve darling ralph's getting the car the phone- your father- father not dead no no a month after that night eve ivory-pale in her white mourning sat huddled in the huge book-lined library with its soft tones of old mahogany furniture she had just had two pain- ful interviews one with her father's laywer who told gently that when the creditors were satisfied she would be penniless the other with cyril clarke in which she repeated her decision not to marry him until he forswore drink and his playboy habits and settled down as junior member of his father's law firm cyril stood balancing himself on unsteady legs medium height too heavy for the middle twenties un- easy mouth bloodshot eyes he smoked one cigarette after the other and regarded her sulkily that's crazy eve a smoothie like you a professional dancer you'll starve to death the first month you know jacques said i ought to make dancing my career eve said quietly but her hands worked nervously and old orloff in petrograd said the same my first engagement's thursday night- the graysons charity garden party the days that she must live through before her debut as a pro- fessional dancer crawled for eve in spite of unending hours of practice sometimes she broke into fits of wild weeping for her father once- twice she longed unbearably to see bob wallace beyond a formal note of sympathy and a box of her fa- vorite deep-purple violets he had completely ignored her she wanted to see him so much that one afternoon humbling her- self she phoned his office he was at the carlton the suite of the great vien- nese nerve spe- cialist doctor- eve didn't try to catch the name she would wait in the carlton lobby she must see bob tell him she was sorry confess after an hour of waiting she saw him step out of the elevator hello bob eve miss hilton wish i could stop but i'm late now at the hos- pital he spoke pleasantly but so distantly eve hurt to the quick would have fled but she saw one hand crush his soft gray hat that en- couraged her he wasn't so stony indifferent after all i phoned your office i wanted to tell you- she forced her eyes to his face a muscle twitched in his cheek there's nothing to tell it was just my fool mistake i've always believed your world and mine don't  street amp smith's love story magazine mix i'm glad i found out the truth so soon before- he was po- litely edging away from her bob she pleaded her heart emptied of hope he was so remote how could she reach him make him understand that out of a world of men her heart had chosen him for her man bob i'm dancing to-morrow night at mrs gray- son's yes for the children's hospital i bought tickets but i won't be there he moved away a few steps then wheeled and said furi- ously please eve stay out of my life i'm a workingman you're an orchid girl besides i'm not the marrying sort eyes burning with angry unshed tears eve stood until he disap- peared through the revolving door then her firm chin lifted some day doctor wallace when my name's in electric lights a foot high i'll send a gorgeous check to your hospital and you'll be proud of me this promise gave her courage when she sped after bob into the grayson house and glimpsed the doctor in the library shaking hands with old colonel grayson she'd wait in the hall pocket her pride tell bob she now was poor as a church mouse a loud voice behind her de- manded where've you been all my life darling and his eyes pin points his mouth working restlessly cyril clarke caught her to him she tried to draw away cy please i want to talk to you eve come in here gripping her shoul- der he half dragged her across the hall eve struggled mentally if she went with cy she'd miss bob and a chance for a magic moment to- gether and a word of explanation if she refused cy he was capable of making a rowdy scene he hadn't been drinking of that she was quite sure but he seemed dif- ferent excited restless deter- mined better hear what he had to say all right cy eve said wearily  following him into a near-by room make it snappy mrs grayson may want me tell her to go chase herself he said rudely you're my girl and father's sore as the deuce about your dancing to-night he's sick in bed -pretty close to the end i'm afraid he wants to see you right away he sent you this and says i'm to bring you to him he thrust into her hand a ring with a magnificent pear-shaped ruby its deep-red fires outlined in the cold gleam of diamonds eve had seen the ring often on the hand of cy's now-dead mother and knew it belonged to the world-famous clarke collection of rubies cyril snatched her sickeningly close and tried to kiss her with a wrench she was halfway across the room but he caught her and tightened his hold that's no way for a girl to treat the man she's promised to marry anyhow let's get going to father he may not live the night through and he wants to tell you about a promise he made your father eve's eyes brimmed with tears her father never in all her life had she felt so desperately alone if only she could talk to her father tell him- it might ease her aching heart to talk about him to cy's father who had been one of his closest friends just a second cy i want to speak to- a friend she stepped out into the hall ahead of cy bob hat in hand orchid girl  he moved away a few steps then wheeled and said furiously please eve stay out of my life i'm a workingman you're an orchid girl besides i'm not the marrying sort was still chatting with colonel grayson near the front door if only bob would look at her she d ask him to give her a mere fvie min- utes alone in the music room but eyes averted he bowed  street amp smith's love story magazine gravely as she let cy hurry her past him out the front door and into his glittering sports roadster as cy's car sped into the drive eve glimpsed bob settle himself behind the wheel of his little flivver with its top folded back and wished achingly she were beside him in- stead of at cy's elbow eve sank deep into her sad mus- ing and answered cy's excited chat- ter only with monosyllables she rarely smoked but to-night in her keyed-up state she accepted a ciga- rette from cy and was glad she was smoking when he begged for a kiss they were racing over a long narrow bridge when glancing about nervously she asked cy haven't you missed the turn in the road this isn t the way to your home he laughed excitedly and squeezed her arm i thought you d be too sleepy to notice angel we're heading across the county border i know a j p who'll marry us to-night eve swallowed her mouth felt dry but she wondered at her com- posure don't be silly cy i can't marry you to-night bob- shut up he said roughly if you want to live you'll marry me to-night or i ll shoot this bus straight into the nearest pole you've fooled around with me long enough i ve decided to-night's the night choose either a marriage or a funeral eve was silent she realized it wouldn't help to plead or coax with cy in his present mood but she felt numbly bewildered she had known him since childhood good- tempered easy-going the butt of every sharper in town but never rough masterful desperate like this wild thoughts shot through her mind she could scream for help but the road was frighteningly lonely patches of black woods open stretches of stubble not a car had passed them she could pull the emergency brake and leap out of the car but likely enough this strange reckless cy would jump out and drag her back perhaps he had a gun and might kill them both she had read of desperate men committing just such unthinkable crimes her safest bet was to appear cool and pleasant and not cross cy in any way maybe she could escape somehow at the j ps was that all

at her controlled voice kidnap us he babbled hold us for ransom perhaps torture us burn out our eyes as they did to the redmond brothers kill us eve sat motionless she fought panic-terror down she felt incased in the ice of fear too numb to move or think or speak she was still so young life was sweet so much ahead of her success per- haps even love but death if she couldn't have bob wouldn't be so bad anyhow she'd never ask mercy of those gangsters she'd die game with her boots on as her dar- ling good sport of a father often said a half sob burst from cy's lips they're gaining on me egad

this afternoon he ll get his if- the car slith- ered to a standstill the pursuing auto shot around another turn in the road and slid to a stop a few feet ahead of cy's roadster cy dropped his head on his hands which still gripped the wheel and sobbed hysterically oh eve if only i hadn't dragged you into this eve glanced at him contemptu- ously he was yellow through and through chicken-hearted though terror froze her and her imagination tortured her she said brace up the worst hasn't happened yet tormented by horrid visions of being bound and gagged she glued her eyes to the door of that other car in another breath now out would leap a gang of masked ban- dits with machine guns and she and cy-- to her gasped amazement only a single figure emerged and ran fleetly  street amp smith's love story magazine bob raced to eve's side of the car ripped open the door and had her fiercely tight in his arms before he exploded what do you mean running off like this with my wife clarke toward cy s car but not before her eyes startled wide open with surprise her thudding heart her hurrying pulses told her who it was bob hateless his face in the moon- light stern and grim as death he raced to eve's side of the car ripped open the door and had her fiercely orchid girl  tight in his arms before he exploded what do you mean running off like this with my wife clarke cy gaped your wife i didn t know- she only said - then relief made him blub- ber i thought gangsters kid- napers- out of gas bob with eve close in his hard but tender clasp hurried toward his roadster over his shoulder he flung back your car's safely off the road sleep off your nerve jag i'll send you gas from the- first sta- tion we pass bob laid eve gently back against the seat cushions and covered her with a robe before he slid under the wheel all set he asked matter-ol- factly but the concern in his man- ner made happiness pour through her veins like golden fire she sighed contentedly to have bob save her like this was more thrilling than the most exciting movie rescue she'd ever seen you're not to talk he ordered with a quick assumption of his pro- fessional manner i'll do that for both of us close your eyes and try to untie your nerves she tried to obey but it was too magically wonderful to be speed- ing under a deep-blue sky pricked with yellow stars beside bob so magically near that her hand could and did touch the edge of his coat she sighed again like a happy child and nestled her head in the cushions a lilt of sheer joy warmed her voice when she broke the silence how did you happen to come for me bob he looked down at her wind- blown golden head frowning spoiled girl must have your own way i told you not to talk well if you must know i didn't like the looks of your boy friend when he was hurrying you out to his car i know something of playboy clarke's habits he was all doped up to- night so when i saw him start off at that breakneck speed i had to put an interne on an urgent case of mine and waste some perfectly good time on a wild-goose chase after you his eyes twinkling down at her softened the harshness of his words and manner silence a wild elation thrilled through her bob must care or he wouldn't have taken the trouble to save her from cy she leaned forward suddenly to stare at him but bob she be- gan her heart a singing bird you told cy i was your wife he lighted a cigarette and in the flare she saw his mouth thin into a hard line don't let that upset you i had to give that poor sap a jolt or he'd have tried to put up a fight for you but i told you before you'd make havoc in the life of a man who's devoting himself to service he took a furious puff at his cigarette inhaled deeply then said in the tone of a person trying to convince himself i wouldn't want you for a wife if you were the last girl on earth not that i'm con- ceited enough he added quickly to think you'd have me stranger things than that have happened she said meekly and wished this ride through the per- fect summer night would last for- ever neither spoke again until a few yards ahead of them loomed up a gas station it'd do that fellow good to stay there all night and sleep it off bob muttered then gave the attendant explicit directions about the location of cy's car bob said as if to himself sud- denly a girl like you should al-  street amp smith's love story magazine ways wear orchids and ride in lim- ousines he shot the car ahead in a sudden burst of speed and lighted another cigarette with unsteady fin- gers eve noticed she laughed and the silver sound of her laugh seemed to irritate bob he glanced at her sharply you find me quite a joke don't you mistaking porcelain for crockery with a shy sweet abandon she caressed his hand on the wheel and had the satisfaction of seeing his face quiver a very pleasant joke bob and we need jokes and fun to help us in this tough old world don't we she asked in her most serious little- girl manner well you don't need to draw a diagram of me making a fool of myself again over you he said haltingly as if he didn't believe his own words i'll do nicely without you in my life expertly he avoided a deep rut in the road you're a golden girl and i'd burn my fingers if i touched you she drew her fingers swiftly pro- vocatively across his lips there did that burn you she demanded then sighed and asked in a low shaken voice why do we have to hurt each other every time we're to- gether bob lighted another cigarette in- haled deeply then flung it into the darkness his voice was hard clipped i've put up a tough fight with myself since i met you that night on the bluff i thought you and i- but now i've got all that licked i have no time for girls no time for anything but my work he flashed her a glance and his eyes told her something that his lips denied something that made a wild surge of joy beat through her both sat very quiet his shoul- ders brushing hers until the roadster some trick you two played on me cried clarke your wife eh well that's a dirty lie she's my girl if i don't get her you won't he swung about a small automatic pointed at bob orchid girl  swerved into her driveway step- ping from the car she suddenly stumbled everything went black before her she would have fallen but for bob's outstretched arms he caught her and carried her soft yielding fragrant to the bronze- grilled door he made a move to  street amp smith's love story magazine set her down but she clung to him like a frightened child please bob don't leave me i'm all alone and i feel so- funny where are the servants dismissed he placed her like something fragile on a couch in the mellow- lighted library and drew up a chair beside her through the gray veil of his ciga- rette smoke he said take it easy eve this has been quite an eve- ning for you he mused some palace this i was born here it hurts to leave it read that in the papers bunk of course she felt his eyes probe hers when she answered steadily nothing left but no debts i'm on my own a professional dancer from now on she smiled bitterly he stared incredulous a so- ciety girl's whim a dancing career earn my way with these she thrust out small feet in silver slip- pers grudgingly he said you have bewitching feet eve she laughed a bit wearily my face isn't so bad either when you get used to it then added indif- ferently i've had an offer to dance in a broadway revue eve hilton in a broadway re- vue he scoffed his mockery filled her with fury how dared he laugh at her their glances crossed and his face sharpened with pain his handsome mouth set stubbornly told her that which made her heart throb to an ecstatic tempo she jumped up must phone before my new yorker leaves for the train excuse me won't be long but she was bob had smoked an unbroken chain of cigarettes be- fore she trailed back white-faced eyes dark-ringed neither spoke for a moment out of that quiet like a hoarse horn out of a fog a voice from a french window in the sun room be- hind them startled them both to their feet some trick you two played on me one hand behind him the other clutching the window frame cyril clarke stood wavering his eyes were glazed his mouth worked convulsively he slurred his words your wife eh well that's a dirty lie she's my girl if i don't get her you won't he swung about a small auto- matic pointed at bob there was a terrible panic- stricken moment then eve leaped forward no no cy i love him a second of hesitation then i told you i couldn't marry you there was some one else- bob he's my husband she flung her- self between the two men with a jerk bob thrust eve aside caught cy's wavering arm slipped the gun into his own pocket and knocked the dope-filled youth flat when moaning and cursing cyril rose bob with a few swift blows rushed him through the win- dow and out into the clump of bushes below i hate to beat up a poor sap like that he's ready for a sanitarium yet it had to be done he remarked evenly but his mouth was steel- hard with a sobbing breath eve crum- pled into a chair her face in her hands i was so afraid- he'd kill you she quavered bob laughed not with those orchid girl  shaking hands i was afraid you would- the mantel clock filled the room with its tickling eve bob said his hands clenched as though words locked behind his lips were being forced from him i can't- i won't love you you'd be a most exciting ex- travagance for an ambitious young doctor but oh my darling- his voice broke suddenly- i can't live without you he swept her close to him and his lips pressed hers satiny berry- red yielding in the glorious magic of that kiss she was thrilled with an ecstasy that she thought be- longed only to the gods her arms crept up around his neck she kissed him and gave her heart into his trust you won't always be a strug- gling doctor dear she said softly he bent his head and rained kisses on her spun-gold hair on the cu- pid's hollow in her throat her hands her mouth exquisite adorable fra- grant as a rose leaf i'll earn with my dancing not when you're my wife be- loved gently he pushed her to- ward the door phone your new york man it's all off but bob- she pleaded he drew her into his arms and kissed her until rapture infolded her like a cloak i may never have much money my love but i can't let my wife dance for money for love then i'll dance my love for you free eve said be- tween a laugh and a sob i phoned him no already said i intended to marry cy she shook her head you her eyes were adoring him i read somewhere when something you want is passing you by run after it so i ran after you with my love bob laughed joyously i did some pretty tall running after you to-night my darling she clung to him she was where she had longed to be closely held in his arms lips upon lips a small quivering sigh escaped her as he released her for a mo- ment then he crushed her to him again and set his lips on hers in a kiss that lifted her to dizzying heights of ecstasy when colds threaten vicks va-tro-nol just a few drops up each nostril if a cold strikes vicks vaporub just rub on throat and chest follow vicks plan for a better control of colds full details in each vicks package heartless flirt by  ives tudor reine haven't you anything to tell me carl trueman asked in a strained voice only that i had a grand week in town and bought scads of clothes reine laughed impishly up at him why didn't you answer my let- ters and telegrams heavens the black lashes flew wide over dark eyes in genuine astonishment it took every spare minute i had to read less than half of them she softened the blow it was dear of you to send them- and the flowers you promised me an answer when you got back he continued grimly you made that suggestion she denied i didn't promise anything see here reine his light-blue eyes snapped displaying temper how long do you intend keeping this up you've the most notorious reputation of flirt by now every unattached male in crest cove is mad about you and a few married ones as well i'm mad about you but i'm not the kind of a man to be led around by the nose reine sighed dismally drawing heartless flirt  down the corners of her lovely red lips for the first time in weeks she felt free to walk where she pleased knowing that paul cartier wouldn't leap out at her from the oddest places shouting childish threats to kill himself unless she married him and now carl was spoiling everything i hoped for a breathing spell now that père cartier has dragged his neurotic offspring back to france she sighed dropping her small head its lovely wealth of hair as black and sleek as the skin of a wet seal i do wish you'd stop being serious carl i'm not in love with you or with any one and i won't marry you for your money his laugh was harsh enough to draw her startled gaze you may change your mind when the new prosecuting attorney starts in he threatens to put your stepdad in the bread line or behind bars reine stopped and swung squarely to face him her cheeks were scar- let with anger small hands clenched and thumped the air he's an idiot sam hollis isn't crooked he helps put men into public office because he believes in them and not for personal gain the prosecutor doesn't think so he says- i know what he says she inter- rupted sharply i've listened to his broadcasts his official investiga- tions will prove him wrong he's after the machine that sam helped- well the political machine that it has taken years to build up i hope they take the meddling fool for a ride he finished viciously you're talking like a dime thriller carl she began to hum a gay song and started across the lawn to join the laughing group on the terrace suddenly the song died on her lips the power to move seemed to desert her she was conscious of nothing but the tall broad-shoul- dered man with the slim hips and trim build of an athlete who stood talking to francine adair while she stared at him he smiled his teeth showing dazzling white in contrast to the deep bronze of his face life flowed back into her limbs she moved forward into the sun- patched shade of silver poplars looking dainty and lovely in the coral-colored chiffon frock a floppy white garden hat dangling from one hand who is that man she asked carl he followed her gaze and laughed as though at a secret joke that my sweet is bart anders the new prosecuting attorney her breath caught in her throat what is he doing here i wouldn't know he laughed derisively he came here the day after you left for town rented the miller bungalow and joined the crowd his mother and mrs lam- son were schoolgirl friends does he know that sam lives in crest cove he's after information if that's what you mean good thing sam is staying in town with dad for a while amy lamson called out a gay greeting reine darling so glad you're back she added you look just like a lovely little girl standing there as if she didn't know it fran- cine adair flung in tartly drawing a few scattered snickers francine had lost carl trueman to reine and resented it reine scarcely heard her she  street amp smith's love story magazine was staring into the bluest eyes she had ever seen smudged with thick black lashes she felt the blood mounting to her face darling amy lamson con- tinued i want you to meet our new prosecuting attorney and the son of my dearest friend bart come here he was beside her now meeting her wide-eyed gaze something flamed between them- something so thrillingly beautiful that it quivered through her like a song his look was like wings beating in her heart brushing against her eyelids linger- ing on her lips now bart mrs lamson warned half seriously after the intro- duction don't lose your heart to - her she's a heartless little flirt be careful bart francine ad- vised lowering white lids over crafty gray eyes she's the daughter of king graft hollis francine mrs lamson rebuked sternly but francine ignored the rebuke paul cartier the diamond baron's son tried to commit suicide over her she continued relentlessly that's not true carl defended the darn fool got drunk and fell out of the canoe a man intent on self-destruction doesn't yell bloody murder to be saved carl thinks the queen can do no wrong francine smirked slyly but the blue eyes watching reine had suddenly lost their wrath and become coldly impersonal terror crept through her a strange devas- tating terror that was an icy flood in her veins a flaming torment in her brain her hands pressed over her heart in a protecting gesture but his frozen look pierced the barrier like stabbing knives so you're reine hollis he stated unsmiling sam is my stepfather she ex- plained my name is rogers his shrug was slightly contemptu- ous as though to say it's all the same breed some one tittered her dark eyes lost their velvety softness and swept the circle silencing mirth red lips tightened angrily emphasizing the determined chin cleft by a dimple that found its mate in her left cheek sam is the best father a girl ever had her voice quivered with anger i admire loyalty in any one bart replied politely their eyes clung and he took an involuntary step forward francine saw and hissed spitefully remember mrs lamson's warn- ing she's a heartless flirt for the first time the coined ex- pression given reine shortly after her return from europe a year be- fore ceased to be amusing she had gained the reputation of flirt be- cause few men could resist the lure of her vibrant dusky beauty and because she had flung herself with the innocent abandon of a happy child into a round of pleasure with each new interesting-male and tir- ing of their insistence had sent them away bewildered and decidedly dis- appointed she had been termed heartless francine bobbed forward and clutched bart's arm with working fingers her foxlike face was flushed a mottled red eyes gleamed mali- ciously through narrowed slits be careful of her bart carl's derisive laughter broke the tension you sound like a black witch on a black black night fran she is a flirt you can't deny it tch-tch carl admonished ls-f heartless flirt  your nasty little brain is a gooey mess of jealousy my pet reine's smile was tremulous her dark eyes wide and serious i'm not as bad as fran paints me mr anders he smiled thinly not being curious i'll probably never know reine flushed and moved stiffly away to join the small group near the lily pond carl followed darling- pamela voight smiled sympathetically- you'll never dan- gle bart's scalp at your belt and it's such a nice dark one dodo wilson sighed dole- fully shaking her blond head les whitney grunted angrily running nerv- ous fingers through his thatch of straw-col- ored hair you blondes talk as though reine were an aborigine head- hunter les had been in love with reine since their romper days his devotion was laughed at even by himself only his kind brown eyes carried a hint of pain when he looked at her reine's dark head lifted in a chal- lenge i've never lost a man yet it was sheer bravado that re- mark she could have added in all truth that until now she had never intended any man to fall in love with her they just did spoiling everything don't break a perfect record by tackling the iron man carl advised sagely a warm glow filled her heart you mean he's not interested in any girl he's a confirmed woman-hater said carl nope les denied quickly he's only shy of girls with daring reputations a flirtatious lady ruined his brother dave's political future some years ago she forgot to tell dave that she was married her husband raised a fuss sued dave and all that it drove him out of politics he died in a plane crash last year that's why bart went into poli- tics dodo added her bit cheerfully he swore he'd get the men who framed dave he blamed no other than- - shut up dodo pamela nudged her tiny companion blamed sam you mean reine finished cleverly that is silly a dangerous gleam blazed in her dark eyes i'll make him eat out of my hand before i am through be careful carl warned those quiet fellows have dispositions like indians not jealous by any chance carl she teased sure i am you're going to marry me my sweet i always get what i want so do i she snapped pertly walking away reine had made a habit of taking her early-morning swim long before the rest of crest cove stirred from bed she loved the fresh dewy sweetness of the morning the in- vigorating cold of the lake water rippling into pure gold where the sun touched it but most of all she ls f  street amp smith's love story magazine loved the solitude the feeling of be- longing wholly to herself she stood for a moment on the bank a scarlet patch of color against the rose-gold of the morning then she plunged in and swam for the raft climbing over the edge just as a dark head bobbed up on the op- posite side bart anders grinned at her good morning he greeted her easily she drew a long breath and laughed you startled me i never expected any one else to be swim- ming at this hour he drew his bronzed body garbed in black trunks up beside her they sat rocking in rhythm to the raft's movements staring at each other with the frankness of children aren't you up early she shook her red-capped head i always swim at this time i love it it's so still and beautiful i feel as though i'm the only person in the world i know it's a grand feeling isn t it he stood up quickly etched against the background of brilliant morning sky and dark water head flung high he looked like a young god great muscles rippled easily and gracefully beneath his bronzed skin he stared down at her and her heart cried out against the barrier between them he would never trust her because of sam and be- cause some one had been cruel and jealous enough to brand her a flirt she shivered but not from cold hadn't you better take your swim and go in he asked matter- of-factly she jumped to her feet with quick graceful movements she reached the springboard leaped high in the air and dived she swam back laughing with the sheer joy of living her next at- tempt was a perfect swan dive he applauded heartily as she climbed back on the float and rested on her back arms tucked beneath her head you can dive he complimented i had hoped to win the crest cove championship this year now i shan't even compete for it you're being nice mr anders i didn't think you could be she was sorry the moment she had said it the friendly laughter left his eyes which became gleaming disks of blue ice his strong mouth stretched to a hard straight line we can't gain anything by use- less discussion- curtly you are privileged to live your life i live mine but you're wrong about sam mr anders- wrong about me too only i don't suppose that's impor- tant she hated the lie it was impor- tant what he thought about her - the only important thing in the world you're either very clever or very stupid miss rogers he flung in with spirit she bridled sam hasn't earned the things you've said about him she shielded her betraying eyes with one hand neither have i i'm not aware of having dis- cussed you with any one no but you've listened to silly gossip it's the same thing you call a brokenhearted boy's attempt at suicide silly gossip reine raised herself on an elbow one slender hand reached-out the fingers closing over his strong brown wrist there was appeal in her eyes and voice and the quaver of tears i'll tell you the truth she prom- ised i met paul cartier in france just before setting sail for home he heartless flirt  followed me here i never pretended to care for him- for any man one night paul got drunk at a party and took a canoe out on the lake it overturned he couldn't swim for- tunately a couple in another canoe heard him cry out he swore he tried to kill himself beause of me it was his way of striking back very convincing she straightened all the lovely color drained from her face there has been and are too many men in love with you for you not to have earned the reputation of heartless flirt men need encour- agement before making fools of themselves  street amp smith's love story magazine you don't believe me frankly no there have been and are too many men in love with you for you not to have earned the reputation of heartless flirt men need encouragement before making fools of themselves how can you be so cruel she couldn't keep the quiver of heartbreak out of her voice tears glittered on her lashes small hands pressed against her throat to ease the pain there she loved him she knew that now his look filled with curious amusement was like the prick of thorns in her flesh he haunted her consciousness like a ghost making her want the feel of his strong arms about her the pres- ence of his lips on her own oh you're cruel she repeated hardly conscious that she had moved nearer that her bare white shoulder brushed against the bronzed flesh of his arm his smile was crooked i'm im- mune to your charms miss rogers tell sam hollis that tell him he'll never trick me as he tricked dave the words reacted on reine like a physical blow she cringed star- ing at him with tear-dimmed eyes he couldn't have said that horrible thing but he had then fury swept her stinging through her pain like the lash of a whip driving her to hurt him as she was hurt you dare accuse me of such despicable cheapness she choked did it ever occur to you that dave anders wasn't framed that when he was caught with another man's wife in his arms he lied to save him- self the blow struck home he winced as from the touch of scorching irons pain twisted his face into a white tortured mask filling reine with a gloating savage joy he looked at her she clenched white lids over stricken dark eyes to blot out the misery she saw mir- rored in those blue depths she wanted to take back that awful ac- cusation to beg his forgiveness most of all she wanted to put her young arms around him to steady his shaking lips with her own you wouldn't have said that if you'd known dave you gave me no benefit of the doubt i'm sorry let's call quits that meant he didn't want to see her again she clenched white lips to strangle back a cry her next words came out involuntarily of course if you re afraid- he interrupted sharply afraid of what of me but that's silly only men with red blood in their veins need be afraid of women they stood up and for a long moment gaze met gaze he reached out and caught her wrist pulling her close to him their young bodies touched and flames coursed through her own leaping to life in her eyes with an abrupt gesture he moved away to the edge of the raft she whirled and made for the other side hitting the water in a clean dive she swam still under water until her lungs threatened to burst and bright-colored spots danced before her eyes she never wanted to come up if only she could go on like this forever losing herself in the cool green depths of the water becoming a part of it but the instinct of youth and health sent her gasping to the sur- face and found her almost in the circle of bart's arms he gripped her shoulder towed her shoreward heartless flirt  until his feet rested on the bottom dear heaven he breathed in quick relief when you didn't come up i thought- well all kinds of horrible things the tone of his voice made her heart sing arid her quick laughter rippled upward on a note of exulta- tion you adorable thing his strong arms swept her close his lips crushed her own in a kiss that lasted through thrilling eterni- ties and rocked the world about her she clung to him afraid to believe that this beautiful thing had hap- pened to them but it had there was reality in his arms straining her close and in the hot pressure of his lips on her own the day was far too long for reine bart was closeted with his campaign manager and she wouldn't see him until later at pamela voight's party she had promised to go with carl and re- luctantly kept the promise the dance was in full swing by the time carl and reine arrived mrs voight had hired an expen- sive orchestra for the occasion they paused on the porch um lovely reine enthused tossing slim arms high slender body swaying gracefully before carl in the beam of moonlight edged by the deep shadows of a vine- covered porch she looked like a slim young goddess the gown of white satin with silver threads through the weave swirling about her silver- slippered feet carl watched her red head thrust forward eager eyes engulfing her you're beautiful he breathed hoarsely she stopped before him sweet face lifted only the image of bart alive in her heart am i carl am i truly beauti- ful it was a wistful cry she wasn't thinking of the effect of her loveli- ness on carl she only wanted his assurance that in bart's eyes she would be everything desirable carl reached out and swept her into his arms crushing the lovely gown carelessly his lips closing down hard on her soft ones stunned by surprise she went limp for a moment and in that moment some one close by in the shadows struck a match and held it to a cigarette in the flare reine caught bart's searching glance filled with a hint of mockery the next instant the light faded out and he was gone she fought like a wild thing in carl's embrace one small hand lashed out in a short arc and landed against his cheek before he would release her winged feet carried her into the house frantic eyes searched the room for bart and couldn't find him an eager partner claimed her she went from one to the other in rapid succession answering questions she scarcely heard laughing when they laughed and all the time her heart was breaking her eyes were search- ing despairingly the dance ended and carl hur- ried up one cheek suspiciously red- der than the other reine forgive me he begged contritely you were so lovely so tempting she stared at him as though he were a stranger what he said didn't matter nothing mattered but bart she swung about to leave him and came face to face with bart fran- cine clinging to his arm gowned in scarlet satin her brown-haired gray-eyed prettiness dimmed to  street amp smith's love story magazine nothing beside reine's dusky loveli- ness we can row up to pirate's rock for a picnic francine was saying i know the dearest spot bart and we- oh here you are reine said deliberately dark eyes fastened on bart's white drawn face this is our dance isn t it bart the music began a slow waltz reine slipped into bart's arms and caught the malignant look francine bestowed upon her out of earshot she whispered i had to talk to you bart i -i was afraid you wouldn't ask me to dance i have good manners even though my judgment is poor he re- plied coldly not looking at her they reached the open french doors leading to the veranda let's go outside please she coaxed when she read curt refusal in his eyes there was a full pale moon riding high in the star-studded sky its image weaving and trembling in the smooth mirror of the lake that stretched away from the foot of the garden it sifted through the screen of scarlet ramblers that trellised the far end of the porch she maneu- vered bart to this spot where shad- ows gave it mystery and a hint of romance he laughed bitterly you choose an ideal setting miss rogers- moonlight music and a beautiful girl she pressed back against the ram- blers a blur of white against scar- let one hand clutched the trellis for support the other reached to- ward him in childish appeal bart you must believe that carl had no right to- to kiss me he stiffened his voice quavered with something deeper than anger you gave him that right i saw you tempt him i heard what said before- you're horribly wrong she broke in she swung close to him a vibrant spark of loveliness one hand caught his shoulder and she raised her face to his i've never given any man but you the right to kiss me bart he caught her wrists and held her away from him you'll not trick me again he lashed out francine warned me you'd try it well i'm onto your scheme yours and sam hollis's and the man who hires him to do his dirty work i'll have them where i want them in a few hours then i'll crush the whole filthy machine and you with it heartless flirt  carl reached out and swept reine into his arms stunned by surprise she went limp for a moment and in that moment she caught bart's glance filled with a hint of mockery the next instant he was gone he was talking wildly but his ac- cusations didn't make sense in her consciousness all she knew was that there was hate in his eyes she brushed limp fingers across her eyes suddenly her heart leaped that wasn't hate she saw it was pain hunger desire she swayed dizzily his arm stiff- ened to give her support she re- laxed against him and his arms tightened about her crushing her close against him the tumultuous throb of their hearts caused them to tremble he caressed the smooth dark  street amp smith's love story magazine beauty of her hair with a shaking hand touched her cheek and the white loveliness of her bare shoulder reverently beautiful- beautiful he mur- mured his cheek resting against her tear-wet one reine - it was a far-away whisper of sound- you're not teasing me this isn t a trick darling darling oh bart kiss me i can't bear it if you don't the kiss caught her up lifted her into a world that held nothing but his arms his lips and his strong trembling body melting against her own then a laughing chattering group barged onto the porch with a sud- denness that left bart and reine frozen in each other's embrace here they are dodo wilson shrieked to some one behind her francine adair thrust herself for- ward hands akimbo you cer- tainly did it reine she tossed back over her shoulder to the others she said she'd make bart fall in ten minutes didn't she and she did it in eight you win reine we'll pay up there was a stunned silence the enormity of francine's trickery left reine speechless icy fingers of fear trailed over her flesh icy fingers beat against her lips to liberate frozen speech the moon stars and earth whirled crazily about her and through it beating against her ear- drums rose wild laughter fran- cine's bart's look washed over her like a baptism of fire he whirled and disappeared into the night with his going life flowed back into her limbs lent wings to her feet she raced after him moaning sobbing his name over and over until it be- came a litany of terror and heart- break she caught up with him frantic hands clung to him nor could he shake them off bart you've got to listen fran- cine lied she lied bart he strode on almost carrying her weight as she clung to him it was only when she stumbled and fell that he stopped he lifted her easily holding her at arm's length aren't you satisfied with what you've done to me he gritted through clenched teeth she struggled to get near to him suddenly he caught her close his kisses weren't tender now they burned and bruised her soft lips sending waves of fear through her she beat tiny fists against his shoul- ders fighting to be free he shoved her away fumbling in his pocket you made me pay in humilia- tion for the kisses you gave me now i'll pay for the ones i stole he thrust something into her hand and walked quickly away dumbly she stared at the thing in her hand it was a new- one- hundred-dollar bill bart had paid for those kisses paid her as though she were- she screamed it lanced the air like the eerie wail of some dying thing the next instant she crum- pled to the grass in a small pa- thetic heap beating the ground with bruised fists sobbing brokenly les found her he picked her up held her tenderly close while she gasped out in anguish after the fierce paroxysm had passed he sug- gested sensibly come back now dear and act as though nothing had happened i can't- i can't you must the others under- stand and francine has gone pa- mela saw to that the moment she heard i ll tell bart- heartless flirt  no she beat his arm shaking  her head the lovely hair tumbling about her face promise me you won't tell him i hate him oh les i wish you didn't love me then i- i could marry you and we d- poor comfort in that thought for either of us dear he said unstead- ily while his mouth stretched in a grimace of pain they reached the porch she shivered and drew back at the sound of music and laughter from within let me be alone for just a min- ute she pleaded like a small hurt ghost she crept to the corner of the porch near the ramblers the place where- could it be only moments ago- bart had held her in his arms reine she jerked rigid and whirled from the shadows a dark figure emerged it was carl listen reine -his voice was clipped strained- you're in a spot some of the girls are spreading a disgusting story saying you've gone pretty far with bart to save sam to save his pride bart will bolster it it was insane reasoning but reine wasn't capable of judging that now she was conscious only that the money bart had thrust upon her burned her hand that she must do something- anything- to prove to him that she had really in- tended to trick him she wanted to wound him now as he had wounded her if we got married to-night reine every one would think you didn't give a darn about him it would hurt him too don't you see that it would it was a tempting argument al- most before she knew it she had given consent and they were speed- ing along the highway in carl's shiny roadster headed for the near- est justice of the peace thoughts tumbled about in her brain strange queer thoughts that made-no sense then like the first low throb of a far-off drum realiza- tion stirred through her she was going to marry carl suddenly she knew she couldn't go through with it carl stop the car she cried it came to a skidding stop at the side of the road he twisted about in his seat to face her lips curved in a mocking smile changed your mind i can't do it carl it wouldn't be fair to you he leaned back with folded arms you'll either consent to marry me reine or we'll spend the night here and what a reputation you'll have by to-morrow you can't mean that try me and see i told you i wouldn't be led around by the nose but i don't love you carl his look was bold sly and filled with something that made her flesh crawl maybe i'll find i don't love you after a month or two then i'll be reasonable about a divorce bart will kill you for this she moaned covering scarlet cheeks with cold hands she hadn't meant to say any such thing carl accepted it as a good joke and rocked with laughter her own clashed against it harsh dis- cordant what did it matter to bart what carl did now or ever after to-night carl gurgled be- tween spells of laughter bart will play ball with the big boys or else he'll- reine jerked very straight hands clenched in her lap quivering with an unknown dread intuition sent   street amp smith's love story magazine she raced after him moaning sobbing his name she caught up with him bart she cried you've got to listen francine lied she lied bart her blindly forward in search of truth on the thin ice of carl's care- less statement you mean they've picked to- night to frame bart she asked controlling the tremor in her voice you know then he demanded sam told me they were out to frame him she lied in desperation yes it's to-night when bart reaches his cabin he'll find a recep- tion committee waiting for him- heartless flirt  cameras all around and a lovely lady for his arms she remembered now bart's ac- cusation against an unknown man he bad said sam worked for she took another blind step then you know that your father is the man sam works for carl he sobered instantly who men- tioned my father oh carl don t look so sur- prised she laughed another lie she felt wouldn't matter i knew it long ago why didn't you tell me you knew she shrugged convincingly sam didn't want me to he accepted the explanation and changed the subject what about us don't go old- fashioned on me darling well- giving him a provocative sidelong glance- you drive to the nearest justice and i'll think it over good girl he enthused reading consent into her reply they reached medville carl drew the car up before a tiny ivy- covered cottage set far back from the road in a grove of maple trees the justice cadaverous and half asleep sensing a large fee let them in he smiled affably when reine asked permission to comb her hair and powder her nose before the cere- mony she followed his sleepy-eyed wrinkled old wife up the stairs once inside the clean bedroom she whirled and gripped the older woman's arm please can i get out of here with- out the men seeing me i'm in ter- rible trouble won't you help me there's the back stairs the woman managed to gasp reine pulled bart's one-hundred- dollar bill from her bosom and thrust it into the gnarled old hand three minutes later she was in carl's car driving like mad toward crest cove it was a badly frightened di- sheveled reine who pounded on the door of bart's bungalow the place was dark the door locked and no one answered her frantic summons a horrible thought left her weak and shaken leaning against the door for support maybe bart had re- sisted his enemies maybe something had happened to him bart- bart a quick thud of running feet up the path whirled her about could it be carl coming after her to force her into marriage she caught a glimpse of the figure in the moon- light and stumbled toward it with a glad cry bart's arms were about her hold- ing her close dear merciful heaven his breath jarred sobbingly through white lips you gave us an awful scare les and i have been hunt- ing you for hours bart you haven't been in the house no i got nearly home then turned and went back to pamela's i had to beg your forgiveness for the awful thing i had done les told me francine had lied i'm so ashamed my darling wild words tumbled from her lips as she repeated carl's story when she had finished he said don't you know this may mean prison for sam she clung to him crying you're all that matters to me bart i'll swear i was here with you all night sam won't let them hurt you then he can't without hurting me darling- darling you'd sacri- fice so much for me  street amp smith's love story magazine i love you she whispered simply and looked at him steady fearless eyes he threw back his head in a chal- lenge to the world nothing can hurt me now sweetheart and there's nothing for us to fear i came up here to give my enemies a chance at me i wanted to trap the man responsible for the political- graft racket i knew he'd try to frame me as he framed dave but the girl they picked to do the trick this time was one of my own assist- ants i matched their trickery and succeeded in placing her in their gang to get information she got it plenty that's what my campaign manager came to tell me to-day we've enough evidence on lathrop trueman to put him behind bar for twenty years and sam the evidence proves him a blind dupe not a crook but he's defi- nitely out of politics she relaxed against him blissfully content his arms tightened about her his lips found her own waiting ones we must find les and tell him you're safe he murmered making no move to do anything of the kind darling she breathed raptur- ously lifting tempting lips again les can wait until- his warm lips smothed the words they forgot les- forgot everything their heaven was only big enough for two love a cloud drifted by  and as i watched i  whispered half aloud  love is a cloud when full of awe  a new moon i saw  i hummed a tune-  love is a new moon i heard a bird sing  just a simple thing  but my heart it fed  love's a song i said love is a cloud a  moon love is a song-  come let us find it now  come come along elfrida norden  violet eyes by  ethel le compte mabrue perched the hat- advance models for spring only two ninety-eight- atop her shining brown hair squeez- ing in between two other bargain hunters she peeped into the mirror the nice things the right hat can do for a girl but dare she spend the money she took off the hat and gazed at it covetously in the bag she held between her slim body and her elbow was less than five dol- lars on saturday she would get the ten dollars aunt bessie sent each week but that would have to go for room rent and food perhaps she had been reckless to buy this suit from marge but it did  street amp smith's love story magazine fit so well was just the right shade of blue and marge had worn it only a few times and where could you get a suit for five dollars she could not wear the outmoded black satin hat that had been aunt bessie's pride last winter and her own abomination this with her new suit and hope to get a job she scowled at the atrocity lying there with her newspaper turned to the help wanted- female page her scowl changed to a look of astonishment as a man's hand reached between two shoppers and grabbed up the hat as if it were a prize actually there was delight written all over the handsome face mabrue saw over the women's heads then he was in front of her thrusting her own hat at her and saying crisply i'll take this put it in a bag and make it snappy please from his bill fold he took ten dollars and gave her that too marbue blinked then she grinned he thought he was buy- ing a new hat what luck now she could buy the new one yes sir she said primly she hurried away only to turn and come back drawing him away from the mob she confessed i'm not working here the hat you want is my old one i was trying on this blue one you see wondering if i could afford it she gulped and held out his money tears stung her eyes and i exploded the young man have spent the morning searching for just this lid for aunt ellen to wear to a funeral sud- denly he brightened say violet eyes how about a swap he de- manded mister you're an angel straight from the pearly gates you're the angel he returned you'll be an archangel if you'll meet me at the glove counter with the hat and change i've got to buy a veil and black gloves and get all the way down to deal new jersey i'll be only too glad to help you out mabrue answered promptly heck i've lost the list with her glove size on it lemme look at your hands young hoss-trader yep about the same size six will do then how do you know i'll show up with the change you're so all-fired honest you couldn't even let me buy the old hat without a scenario of the plot lady norman norris trusts thee on the way to the glove counter mabrue went to the rest room to freshen her complexion and change hats she smiled at her reflection as she approached the glove counter she thought how tall and well-built and how very well dressed norman norris was he smiled at her as he would at his nearest and dearest and spoke in a voice just as intimate auntie's veil and gloves he said as he dropped the small bags into the large one she gave him here are the blue gloves you wanted dear to the clerk he said not many wives trust their husbands to pick out their mittens do they perhaps madame would like to try them on smiled the girl once more this strange young man was making mabrue blink her winsome face grew rosy then she laughed delightedly why not she said airily favor- ing her husband with a mocking smile did you get the rompers for susie and union suits for danny she perched on the stool and violet eyes  rested her elbow on the little cush- ion while the clerk cased on the exquisite blue glace gloves what size does aunt ellen wear mabrue asked with a twin- kle seven norman matched her twinkle told you i'd lost the list so how do i know about susie's rompers and danny's undies you lose everything my prob- lem child sighed mabrue well who lost her wedding ring flung back norman norris i suppose to-day is as good as any to buy you a new one no rings are so frightfully victorian mabrue drawled you were proud enough of yours he murmured close to her ear when i put it on your digit last june- er- i mean several junes ago considering we have susie and danny on the lost list my pet were shoes sheers and peach-col- ored do-dads for you remember of all the zanies chuckled mabrue hose for madame put in the clerk signaling to a clerk at the op- posite counter mabrue said hastily we'd best buy the children's things first norman grinned wickedly socks for mamma first he decreed then i'll cure you smarty ma- brue told him low but when she bought six pairs of the sheerest he only laughed black for auntie size ten he ordered no cobwebs however the hosiery went into the hat bag ladies shoes he inquired i shall be pleased to escort you there sir spoke up an elegant young man i'm smithers of la- dies shoes been matching hose for a customer he smiled ingratiat- ingly at the handsome pair mabrue clutched norman's sleeve are they all in conspiracy with you to push me from one de- partment to another seriously mr norris the joke has gone far enough already i said norman taking her arm and following their guide haven't had so much fun since the mice made a nest in aunty's best wig i feel as if i were living in a comic strip laughed mabrue i live by one my lamb i do the let's be gay strip oh i adore that series cried mabrue could you adore its papa nice fellow sober reliable amusing though slightly mad he dotes on sleek brown hair with red glints in it violet eyes with imps in em devastating dimples and lus- cious lips why there's my uncle mabrue was away like a shot norman was after her like an- other and more speedy shot when she admitted it was a ruse to get away he grew grave he asked so- berly you want to get away end this and it was off to such a good start they returned to the guide and norman explained thought we saw uncle eben but it was two other people lead on mr smith- ers we can save time if you don't mind climbing a short stairway sir we spent our honeymoon climb- ing the alps norman assured him at the turn in the stairs he drew mabrue to him i was so happy over finding such a delightful play- mate he chided why did you scram because i can't let you see the darns in my stockings mabrue confessed close to tears this foolery has been the only fun i've  street amp smith's love story magazine had since i came to the city it was worse back home why you poor sweet bunny his free arm went around her and his concerned eyes looked into hers dewy violets he breathed and kissed her soft tremulous mouth with infinite tenderness for a second mabrue clung to him then freed-herself you will play with norman sweet vi eye he pleaded softly but the d-darns she wailed i love em because you did em with your own fair hands when mr smithers slipped off mabrue's scuffed brown oxford and the darns were revealed in all their neatness mabrue flushed rosily while the salesman was seeking the blue kid pumps and brown ox- fords asked for norman said i crave to see those enchanting ankles in sheers how you do run on mr nor- ris laughed mabrue her color deepening does my running get me to the goal i hope for he demanded does it usually you must have had plenty of experience i have but i've never been so darn keen about a girl before he told her with earnestness in his gay voice and eyes mabrue had nothing to say to that she wanted terribly to be- lieve him but it was all so impos- sible after mr smithers had fitted her she whispered to norman just the oxfords the blues are ador- able but not practical we'll take both norman said crisply now for lunch i'm in your debt too much al- ready mabrue demurred i'm in yours you mean be- cause of your hat aunt ellen will probably leave me an extra million is there really an aunt ellen two hundred pounds of her nearly sixty a tartar but i love her we live together in an old- fashioned apartment in the murray hill section but she spends a lot of her time visiting old friends in the hinterland she's been with a sick friend in deal the friend died yes- terday hence the shopping i've got to drive down there to-day with the stuff i thought you were buying the hat for a joke or something it's a hand-me-down from my aunt we've both cherished it but it does need a new lining i'll buy one you wanted to see the sheers on so i'll go to the rest room and put them and the new pumps on and meet you at the restaurant on the eighth floor order something light for me is it emily post to lunch with a lady whose name you do not know mabrue milburn accepts mr norris s kind invitation to lunch- eon mabrue milburn isn't taking a run-out powder is she when mabrue fairly dancing in the new pumps entered the restau- rant she saw norman's sleek black head at once she thrilled at the ob- vious relief on his face we should have gone where there was dancing he said seating her you've got to drive to deal she reminded him worse luck- but i mustn't say that when i've just had the luck to meet you the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me there will be other days- heady spring days and glorious summer nights too mabrue's heart was beating with a new wild beat her lovely face ls f violet eyes  was radiant she fairly sparkled she looked and felt another girl from the one norman had mistaken for a clerk meeting you has been the nicest thing in my life she said eying the mixed grill being placed before them she asked do you call this light nope just sensible go to it kid i'm starved myself presently mabrue was telling him of her life in the up-state town of aunt bessie's kindness to her or- phaned niece she let me come to new york to look for a job she went on and she's been sending me money when she can't afford it i'd about given up trying to find work when marge- she rooms next i've never been so darn keen about a girl before he told her with earnestness in his voice and eyes mabrue wanted terribly to believe him but it was all so impossible ls f  street amp smith's love story magazine to me- told me it was my clothes she sold me this suit yesterday and told me to buy a hat after luncheon they bought the lining for the hat but the trimmer wouldn't sew it in because the hat hadn't been bought there there are needle and thread at home norman said tentatively then you can sew it in mabrue told him with an impish grin and lose my amateur standing let's go buy the peach do-dads i veto further splurging dear ex- husband whadda ya mean ex the word is future husband when they climbed into norman's car they had the peach do-dads during the short drive mabrue was telling herself that aunt bes- sie to the contrary it was all right to accept these things from a young man for whom you had done an inestimable favor it was all right to go to his apartment when he was as nice as norman to do him an- other favor it was a walk-up brownstone quietly elegant the vestibule boasted brass letter boxes complete with speaking tubes and push but- tons the floors were black-and- white marble the stair carpet tur- key-red i'd like to slide down the ban- isters laughed mabrue a second later all their purchases were on the stairs and she was fly- ing downward on the shining rail she hit the nearest post hard saves me spanking you grinned norman i do not intend to do anything to warrant a spanking sir oh no norman's straight black-brows shot up comically the telephone was ringing as they entered the apartment look around while i answer it norman suggested mabrue wandered from the spa- cious drawing-room with its massive furniture rich silk hangings and deep-piled carpet into a small room she caught her breath at the sheer beauty that met her eyes cabi- nets filled with exquisite chinese porcelains lined three of the walls when norman joined her she said i didn't know there was any- thing so exquisitely beautiful in all the world exquisitely beautiful yes but dashed valuable and by way of being a nuisance the apartment is never left alone nights because of this stuff aunt ellen gathered it when she lived in the orient that was the old girl on the wire i've got to stay in deal for the funeral norah our cook is ill at her daughter's belle the day cleaner won't stay here nights alone i'll have to phone some of my friends and see if i can get any of them to stay i'll sew the lining in while you do it offered mabrue you know i could look at that lovely china forever that's all it's good for- to be gazed at too easily broken to be used or even touched like friend- ship when you ask a favor or hearts hearts don't break i ought to know he said savagely but did not explain he led her into a bed- sitting room with ivory-colored walls and furniture gay chintzes and rugs through the sunny win- dow mabrue saw with surprise a small square lawn hedged in and a little maple tree the only young room we boast norman commented aunt ellen fixed it up for her grandniece faith but the poor kid was so scared of  violet eyes  the old tartar she scrammed here's the sewing box when he returned the hat looked almost new and quite perky ma- brue pulled it over her ears and made a face why the gloom she asked norman laughed i thought all the ad putter-inners must be blind but if you wore that lid no won- der you didn't get a job oh i had this tissue paper in- side to pad it good it's sure to fit over auntie's wig the gloom is because i can't get any one to stay here for several days and nights just what i expected as i said friendships are easily broken when you ask a favor i don't know what to do- say mabrue could you stay i could but- well how do you know i'm to be trusted i've proved that you are miss hoss trader look there's a ra- dio scads of books magazines and even a new toothbrush he pulled out a dresser drawer nighties and everything for auntie's guests or you you can phone the stores for food and charge it how about it vi eye how long do you want me to stay until monday- no forever he caught her hands in his and drew her to him mabrue you lovely witch what have you done to me i do want you here forever close to my heart she felt his lips on her shining hair his breath warm on her fore- head straining back she searched his eyes what she saw there sent quivers of ecstasy from her heart to her smiling lips are we dreaming this norman she asked it was his kiss on her lips that told her she was not dreaming that kiss fiercely tender passion- ately demanding awakened her to the full meaning of life i love you love you he was saying as he rained kisses on her face and soft white throat he lifted her in his arms and carried her to the armchair near the window i hate to leave you sweetest he la- mented i shall think of you sleep- ing in that little bed and dreaming of me each day look out this win- dow and watch the tiny leaves of the maple opening under the warm kiss of the sun just as your dear heart opened when i kissed your sweet lips presently there was a good-by kiss- a whole series of good-by kisses- then mabrue was alone with her rapture and her bewilderment things just did not happen like this in real life she would wake up and find herself in that ugly room up- town she spent the greater part of her time admiring the exquisite loveli- ness of the china behind glass where no rude hand could break it be- cause of that rare collection she was here she recalled norman's savagely bitter denial that hearts break why had he said that he ought to know- she wondered saturday afternoon she found out the answer belle had cleaned the already im- maculate place and had left with a friendly smile to this new grand- niece of miss ellen's when the bell rang thinking it was the superin- tendent whom norman had in- structed to call several times a day to see if all were well mabrue opened the door past her through the foyer and into the drawing-room swept a tall beautiful young woman in smart ex- pensive clothes  street amp smith's love story magazine the taxi driver is bringing up my baggage she called out but who are you mabrue de- manded rushing after her the intruder turned and stared haughtily i am mrs norman norris to think of aunt ellen actually getting a new maid did norah die or-- say you're not a maid another grandniece or one of norman's friends mabrue fighting off recurring faintness was unable to answer she sank into a chair feeling as if the whole world was rocking on its foun- dations so my last guess was right flared the other girl her face a mask of fury the old dragon must be away or he wouldn't dare high time i came back from florida you little pirate i've a mind to tear your eyes out and - she checked her- self as the taxi man appeared with her baggage this way please she led him to norman's room mabrue bolted for the kitchen she held the ammonia bottle under her nose gulped down cold water oh it can't be true she wailed aloud burying her face in a dish towel oh it can't eh the girl who claimed to be norman's wife burst into the room if you don't be- lieve me call the superintendent norman always was unfaithful to me but this is the most audacious thing he ever did wait until i tell aunt ellen- you'll have to prove to me that you are mrs norris mabrue cut in white as death but suddenly mis- tress of herself look inside this ring then said the other coldly mibrue took the wedding ring she pulled off engraved inside it was from n n to d s -- mabrue laid the ring back on the table if that isn't enough look at this the girl said taking up the ring and throwing down a small snapshot taken from her bag mabrue bent to look at the pic- ture there was no mistaking that it was of norman and this girl fur- thermore there was the signature she had often seen on the let's be gay cartoons nor-man ris and underneath it and my-wife diane -- it was sunday evening for twenty-four hours mabrue had lain on her bed in the ugly room she had thought never to use again there had been a few blessed hours when she had slept awake she had been on the rack of torturing thoughts things had blurred since she had looked at the smiling pictured faces that had proved that norman had lied to her and deceived her the stab that had killed her faith in him had done something terrible to her she had heard diane norris say if you weren't such a sweet innocent- looking little thing i'd have had the police here instead of bothering with proofs clear out before i change my mind the only thing mabrue took out of all norman had bought was a pair of stockings she had put her darned ones on the dumb-waiter with the rubbish she had hesitated about the hat but had left it and departed bare-headed thinking of the hat which had started it all she wept anew awake mabrue asked a girl's anxious voice from the doorway please leave me alone marge mabrue sobbed marge came in and shut the door violet eyes  mrs norris stared at mabrue haughtily so my guess was right you're one of norman's friends you little pirate i ve a mind to tear your eyes out i risked her smelling the toast she said cheerfully so you'll have to eat it and drink the tea she came over to the bed and switched on the light mabrue sat up and blinked you're sweet marge she said she drank the hot tea thirstily and nibbled at the toast won't you tell me all about it honey coaxed the visitor then harshly there are laws in this land you know if some guy- marge i've told you all there  street amp smith's love story magazine is to tell it's not what you think she gave back the plate and cup may i have your newspaper to look for a job please i'll get it but honestly honey you've got me scared while mabrue looked through the want ads marge read suddenly marge giggled well if this dame isn't wearing the twin to your hand-me-down lid i'll eat the paper she cried out it was the name that mabrue saw first- norman norris then his picture he was with a handsome elderly woman who was wearing the old hat she had given him mabrue with a little cry seized the news sheet her heart pounding madly she read the account of the funeral of a wealthy jerseyite which norman norris famous cartoonist and miss ellen bradburst norris daughter of- the late senator wade norris had attended monday evening found mabrue and marge in the latter's room they had just eaten a sketchy meal cooked over the forbidden electric grill monday in the housewares is no picnic yawned marge but i bet you feel worse than i after tramp- ing all day and not finding a job you should have bought a smart hat as i told you she chided never guessing how she was hurting ma- brue my béret looks cute on you but it's not the right lid to go job hunting in that reminds me the dame with the twin of your hand- me-down is hogging the headlines in again to-night mabrue turned cold with terror he-she isn't- hurt or anything robbed take the paper along with you i'm going to lie down mabrue hurried to her own room with the newspaper under the picture which had appeared the day before was the headline new racket priceless china stolen ransom demanded when miss norris and her nephew nor- man norris creator of the popular syndi- cated cartoon let's be gay returned to their murray hill apartment this morn- ing they discovered that the choicest pieces of miss norris's famous collection of ori- ental china had been stolen the thief had left a note which read you can have your stuff back for five thousand dollars i shall phone instruc- tions monday a girl named mary brown hired by mr norris to guard the china is being sought in-- mabrue read no more her mind in chaos she slipped downstairs to the telephone in the hallway she found norman's num- ber in the directory and dialed it her heart was thumping so it shook her body he had said hello three times before she could answer she said norman this is mabrue i didn't take the china nor- mabrue his voice shouted i know you didn't say they didn't kidnap you too did they he cried in alarm no they may have kidnaped -your wife diane how did you know about her he asked harshly mabrue replaced the receiver and stumbled blindly upstairs in her room she collapsed on the bed norman had lied to her deceived her his own words had confirmed that sobs shook her great tear- ing sobs but her eyes were dry she became aware of loud voices heavy footsteps then a pounding on her door and a demand that she violet eyes  open in the name of the law the door swung open and two police- men came into the room your landlady says you just used the phone said one what number did you call miss mabrue simply stood and stared you called mr norris and you didn't know all calls to him were being traced did you better come clean mabrue was fighting off faintness when marge pushed aside the two men and rushed to her mabrue stopped fighting marge was giving her water when she struggled back to consciousness you two scaring the poor kid raged marge what's- sorry but she's gotta come along with us mabrue went so did marge in the station house mabrue clung to marge shaken with terror as she faced the officer in charge suddenly terror left her she drew herself up and looked at the man behind the desk in a low steady voice she said i have done nothing wrong why should i be afraid what do you want with me you'll know all about that when mr norris gets here she was told he is coming here oh i can't stay let me go afraid you'll have to stay miss said the sergeant kindly i- oh here he comes she clung to marge quivering and shaken the young woman who phoned you is here mr norris some one said then he was standing before her his face white and haggard his hands reaching out taking hers why mabrue he said with a laugh obviously forced i am sorry this happened he turned from her bewilderment to the sergeant and said this young lady is my fiancée officer i-er-well i tought she was out of town and did not expect her to phone of course you didn't know this and with your orders to trace every call you did only your duty may i take her away now sir why of course mr norris the sergeant said readily norman thanked him he said softly to mabrue i'll explain outside i marge her best friend put in a voice i'm tagging along to see that she gets a square deal she's been crying her eyes out since saturday and i'm after the guilty one i'm the guilty one marge nor- man confessed gravely but- they've got a young woman at the thirtieth street station house mr norris interrupted the ser- geant this is the right one she talked ransom to miss norris all right i'll give you escort down there outside mabrue drew away from norman but he held her and said diane didn't tell you that i was able to have our marriage anulled a month after it took place did she well i did mabrue how could you doubt me darling i love you will you marry me norman she raised a radiant face for his kiss norman's care followed the squad car as it raced downtown don't mind me said marge i'm the perfect chaperon-blind deaf and dumb also the perfect friend added norman i'll never forget that ok said marge but i'll call it square if you find out whether that red-headed cop who's leading us is married or not and if not fix  street amp smith's love story magazine why mabrue norman said when he arrived at the station house he turned to the sergeant this young lady is my fiancee officer of course you did only your duty but you've made a mistake it so's he drives me home alone agreed laughed norman he tucked mabrue's hand under his elbow even that helps he said softly gosh vi eye when i got home and you weren't there i nearly went crazy i'd told aunt ellen everything and had sold her on the idea of a new niece chiefly because of the hat and- then it was mabrue's hat put in marge chortling some day we'll tell you the whole story offered mabrue and you left everything even the new hat chided norman i violet eyes  knew you hadn't stolen the stuff and i was afraid to let myself think you'd been kidnaped his arm crushed her hand the thought of any one hurting you- some one did mabrue inter- posed that girl diane she had your ring and a picture of you both with your signature on it egad why did she show up after all these years how did she know we were away do you suppose it was she who took the stuff it was diane they had at the thirtieth street station once more mabrue faced her but this time norman was at her side even so mabrue turned away from the un- masked hatred in the other girl's eyes you stole the stuff nor- man asked incredulously it was the desk sergeant who answered she did mr norris we found it all at her apartment after she had spoken to your aunt she had implicated the superin- tendent of your apartment house they seem to be friends and he tipped her off that there was only a young lady in your apartment and she must be very important to you seeing the way he was ordered to look out for her this is the young lady sergeant miss milburn and i are engaged diane spoke for the first time in a voice that dripped venom she said i pity you youngster and i hope he gives you a better deal than he gave me the snob i had no intention of broadcasting the facts of our unhappy union norman said sharply but you've asked for it by that remark i was able to have our marriage annulled be- cause it was proved that you had gone through the wedding ceremony several times before you met me without bothering about divorces also you had served time for black- mail mabrue didn't look at the other girl as the officer silenced the angry tirade that followed norman's de- nunciation of her norman asked may miss mil- burn and i go sergeant miss milburn may you've got to stay and make the charge mabrue joined marge waiting in another room marge had evidently not waited for norman to find out  street amp smith's love story magazine about the marital status of the red- headed cop for they were laughing together like old friends mr casey is seeing me home mabrue she said shall i wait until mr norris is finished no run along telephone me at his apartment she grew rosy i'll need a bridesmaid very soon marge presently mabrue and norman were driving through the busy streets to the quieter murray hill section outside the door he took her in his arms you do love me he asked tenderly yes but i can't seem to think that- when one is in love one doesn't think sweetest one only feels tell me what you feel darling one she whispered tenderly i feel that all the love i am capa- ble of is going out to you my own sweetheart he mur- mured he laid his lips on hers in a kiss that sent the blood racing hotly through her she clung to him in the dimness every fiber of her being vibrant throbbing as she gave him back kiss for kiss to-morrow he said huskily will be our wedding day let's go tell aunt ellen that all's well you must not be afraid of her sweet- heart she's really a kindly soul i fear nothing when you are with me to-morrow's husband she mur- mured as he carried her upstairs he asked want to slide down again or shall i spank you she laughed and nestled closer in his embrace after norman had told aunt ellen that it was diane who had stolen the china which he assured her was quite safe and would be returned he brought mabrue to her it took the elderly lady a full three minutes to inspect the younger one then she exclaimed you'll do child and kissed mabrue heartily presently she resumed her doze only to start awake and glance at the lovers on the divan talking ear- nestly where does your aunt buy her hats mabrue she demanded but mabrue and norman were lost to everything save their own happy plans so with a resigned shrug aunt ellen turned away anything might happen to the maid of honor said avis kent to herself as she sped along the deserted moun- tain

a serial - part iii  chapter viii a sickening sensation swept bobbie hulda and red arm in arm were entering the store hesitating a minute at the door with the rays of the setting sun a shaft of gold before them hulda's braids caught its gleam and shone yellow as wheat at har- vest time against red's towering shoulder he was saying something to her smiling down at her his white teeth shining they took a table not three feet from bobbie her back was toward  street amp smith's love story magazine them but she watched in a little mirror that faced her on the wall as they settled themselves and as red gave their order by reaching over her shoulder and back a little she could have touched red's arm but hulda was hidden behind his broad-shouldered form it was hulda's low sweetly heavy voice however that held bobbie frozen i won't be able to see you again she was saying i don't dare red coming in here like this is crazy bill is terribly jealous he's blaming me for everything he swears i'm double-crossing him and if he ever finds out that i'm meeting you like this he'll do some- thing dreadful to both of us bobbie gasped then red's low rumble sounded comforting cautioning soothing and his brown hand covered the girl's strong white one her eyes glued on the mirror before her bob- bie watched his bent head in a turmoil of bitter rebellion she thought what has she to give red that i couldn't why must he go to a girl like that for love it seemed an eternity to bobbie waiting there in the soft dusk be- fore they moved but when they had gone out to the street at last and following she had stood for an instant in the shadow of the awning watching them go their different ways she had seen what they hadn't some one else watching too- bill nolan she knew by the great blacky anger of his lowering face that he had seen what she had arid her heart was a twist of fear and shame- fear for red's safety and shame that she could fear it was long after sundown when she reached home the cottage was unlit deserted even her father was gone from his chair on the porch leaning against the rail she stared down into the valley below with a strange tired listlessness she thought i suppose i ought to warn red about nolan but i can't and anyway he couldn't do any- thing to-night he's probably down on the bridge now and he'll be there till he goes off duty to-morrow morning i could go down and tell him but i'd probably run into pitt and honey making love to each other somewhere in the moon- light her lip curled love what was it anyway- this thing they called love- this thing that could tear one's heart into little pieces when she could stand the loneli- ness and silence no longer she went down to the office where's every- body she asked and a draftsman bending over a blue print looked up at her from visor-shaded eyes chief's gone to the city he told her a wire came late this after- noon carson drove him to the train said to tell you he'd be back day after to-morrow sure miss ash- ton was round here a little while ago but she's disappeared isn't she up at the cottage honey there was a startled catch in bobbie's throat didn't she drive in with them then prompted by a fear she wouldn't acknowledge even to herself she added where's tim do you know where i can find him the man laughed say you'd better stay away from that old boy he's on a rampage there's dyna- mite missing from the storehouse and he's got blood in his eye but his last words were lost on an empty doorway on the swish of primitive love  a swiftly vanishing figure and the cry of a hoot owl from a withered stump that once had been a tree bobbie found tim down where the forms for the last almost-com- pleted arch rose ghostly against a star-dotted sky tim she gasped is it true is there dynamite missing from the storehouse they told me at the office is it true true a firefly split the dusk  tim slapped at it angrily ain't you been raised round camps like this gal don't you know we check every stick of dynamite that's used- every cap and inch of fuse sure it's missing and believe me i've got ten men pacing this bridge to-night i'm going to keep them pacing it every night from now on until we're through one try at blowing us up is enough there ain't going to be another- not while your dad's gone anyway bobbie grabbed his arm and shook it her voice was shrill with terror oh tim you fool she cried it's not your bridge that's going to be blown up to-night don't you see it's honey she's stolen your dynamite she's going to do that fool thing you told her to do the other night up at the cottage she's going to blow a hole in bear creek and flood red out where is she have you seen her anywhere think tim think no i ain't seen her what's the matter heat got you tim was irritated why that kid couldn't blow a hole in a tin can she's scared to touch the stuff squealed like a mouse if i poked it at her get out now and leave me alone swear if i blame red for spanking you i'd do it myself goldarn it if you was a year or so younger he yanked his arm loose and made his way into the maze of giant footings his lantern swinging carefully ahead of him sent tiny light beams among the towering timbers- beams that grew fainter and fainter to lose themselves at last in the shadowy gloom as bobbie watched him disap- pear utter despair swept her no one would believe her- tim her father laughing thinking her crazy but she knew she knew what love could do to a girl to what heights or what depths it could drag her honey had stolen that dynamite bobbie was as certain of it as though her own eyes had witnessed the theft for days honey had been brooding over what tim in his blind fooling had suggested- been planning for it and she had taken this opportunity when she was left alone to go over to red's camp and blow that hole in the bank of bear creek what motive but that could have kept honey hanging around tim's heels that hot morning learning how to set a blast watching how dynamite was laid oh what an idiot she had been what a blind self-centered idiot so wrapped up in her own troubles she couldn't see what lay right be- fore her eyes that white-iron look in honey's face should have told her if nothing else had she remembered those eager questions honey had thrown at her father and tim if- if some one let the water down on red's camp would that mean you'd win the bonus would that mean you'd win the hundred thousand dollars  and above all else the love in her eyes when they had rested on pitt that awful avid hunger of love and before bobbie knew what she  street amp smiths love story magazine was going to do before she could reason or plan her feet were carry- ing her up the river path which led to red's camp she was running as she never before had run in all her motherless tomboy life- like a wild thing through the weedy knee-high grass honey knew that path red had taken them all over it to show them the dam they had stopped at the bank of the diverted river overlook- ing the camp while red explained how once the dam was finished it was to be swung back into its old channel once more that's where honey would head for- that place above the camp something inside bobbie told her so it seemed to bobbie that she could see honey running too terror- stricken lugging her awful burden poor foolish love-crazed honey there were clouds in the sky- smoke clouds from those far-away fires- that covered the moon through them the stars peeped fit- fully as though they too were afraid and the night breathed itself into the croak of the frogs and the cricket's never-ending chirp stumbling over briers stones and weeds bobbie had reached the rise of ground that led up to the newly made river bank when she came on honey at last she was lying face down in the dirt the twist of dynamite sticks was beside her a tangled line of fuse soaked with dew trailed like a white worm in the weeds her pretty white dress was a torn rag about her she was crying her shoulders shaking with the sobs that became words to lose themselves with the medley of night sounds that filled the air she heard bobbie and sitting up turned to her a swollen face that was beyond fear i can't do it i can't i thought i could blow up the old creek and -and i can't i don't know how to set it off and i'm so scared she struck a match and in its light bobbie saw that the ground was a litter of matches all about her she made an effort to set the fuse to burning it sizzled splut- tered and bobbie ground it out be- neath her boot snatching at honey's shoulders she yanked her upright and shook her until reason came back into her blankly staring eyes but with reason there came to honey something else- terror it was a terror that swept her as the flood she had been trying so vainly to release would have swept red and his sleeping camp below watching her bobbie saw her try to scream there was something un- speakably dreadful about the scream that died against dry parched lips- something horrible about the white-rimmed wide- opened eyes and the white outflung hands that shielded her as she backed away down the path into the meadow below bobbie watched her as she ran her white dress billowing about her like a straying moonbeam lost in the smother of the night standing where honey had left her bobbie poked gingerly at the smudging fuse touched with the tips of her boots the dynamite sticks in their- yellow wrappings dull anger gripped her i'll have to gather this stuff all up and sneak it back into tim's storehouse she told herself i'll have to shield honey as i've shielded red i'll have to go on lying pretending- oh i'm sick of it i'm sick of everything she was still standing there the dynamite sticks under one arm a primitive love  length of white fuse trailing for- lornly from a listless hand when red found her coming up from the camp below his foot- steps softened by the matted grass he was standing almost beside her before she heard him it was that strange sweet haunting of his nearness that brought her swinging breathlessly toward him for he said noth- ing at all he simply stared down at her with eyes too sad for anger suddenly bobbie came upon honey she was lying face down in the dirt and crying her shoulders shaking with sobs i can't do it i thought i could blow up the old creek but i don't know how to set it off  street amp smith's love story magazine a seed pod from a locust tree dropped with a dry rattle to the ground at bobbie's feet the lights from the sprawling camp below made a crazy-quilt pattern against the night her heart pounding high in her throat choked her wearily red leaned over his tall body bending awkwardly from the hips wearily he gathered up the length of trailing fuse and tore it loose from its cap for a girl who's been raised in a construction camp he said that's a pretty bum job bobbie thought i'd taught you how to handle pow- der better than that and besides -his eyes swept the bank and turned with careful judging to the black-shadowed valley with its glimmering lights- you're not far enough up the slope to do much good it's a shame but i guess there isn't anything for you to do but to take your stuff and trot back home and bobbie answered him too tired to fighttoo hopeless to try an explanation yes i guess there isn't red and stumbling a little her feet found the river path she slept that night in her father's room through the crude partition she could hear honey's sobs she can't be any more miserable than i am bobbie thought dully and turned her face to the wall grateful for the utter and over- whelming weariness that like a sedative brought her blessed for- getting the light was streaking through her window when she awakened at last to a strangely familiar voice- sandy mcmaster's its high- pitched thin tones cut through the walls to her ears all right pitt carson if bob brent ain't here he ain't but where's that tomboy kid of his get her out here where i can talk to her red's gone i tell you he's been kidnaped- maybe murdered if she knows anything about it i'm going to find out anything that's ever happened to red to hurt him came through her she was hanging round our camp last night i saw red and her talking together up on the bluff and when he come back down some- thing ailed him he got in his car and drove off toward town and never came home the car's stand- ing empty up at the top of the hill there's blood marks in it and a piece of his shirt all torn and bloody caught on the fender don't think i haven't heard what you've been saying over here- spreading stories that we're double- crossing you red and me lies dirty lies if it hadn't been for red holding me back i'd been over here long ago and cleaned up on the pack of you but if you've done anvthing to red if you ve dared to- bobbie's feet struck the floor with a bang she thrust her arms into an old bath robe of her father's it trailed the floor sweeping fantasti- cally about her it had been four years and more since she had heard sandy mcmas- ter's voice but listening the room seemed to fade away the years for- gotten and she was standing a child-wife with her boy-husband beside her shivering before this same thin pipe of anger uncon- sciously she looked down at her hand expecting red's fingers to be clasping it protectingly and suddenly all her hatred and suspicion were gone all the shame that these awful last days had ls f primitive love  added to four years of heartbreak and hunger were swept away in one wild panic of terror what was this awful thing sandy was saying about red's being kid- naped about his empty blood- stained car a small white-faced figure with huge gray eyes beneath tousled brown hair an oddly pathetic fig- ure lost in the great bath robe that enveloped her bobbie threw her- self from her room uncle sandy she cried snatch- ing at his arm and her eyes through their unbelievable lashes were white- rimmed with the fear that widened them oh uncle sandy i do know what's happened to red i do it's bill nolan he's jealous of red and a girl up at the junction he- he saw red with her yester- day oh i should have warned him i did see red last night but i- i there were other things and then- the old man looked at her other things he grunted sure fighting i suppose like you always did- you two can't live together and can't live apart and if you say my red's got himself mixed up with any junction trash you lie he ain't i'm his father and i know even this new girl he's got himself engaged to can't keep him from breaking his heart over you pitt thrust himself forward his face was gray but his eyes were black and hot fright fought with the anger that filled them a fright that bobbie saw and that multi- plied itself to her own wild terror fastening his fingers on bobbie's sleeve he swung her behind him he said to sandy i don't know anything about bobbie's being over at your place last night and i don't know anything about what she's just been telling you but if your ls f precious red has been playing round with bill nolan's girl and nolan caught him at it he's prob- ably got what's coming to him for nolan's disappeared he didn't show up for work last night and he hasn't been near so far this morn- ing find him if you can i can't and i want him worse than you do the old man was stamping down the steps when bobbie found her voice uncle sandy she sobbed hys- terically oh uncle sandy take me with you let me hunt red with you i love him i'll do anything to find him but against that stubborn disappearing back bob- bie's voice trailed off into a futile wail and pitt was talking to her his voice knife-edged if you're through making a fool of yourself and of me i'd like your story and i'd like it straight what do you know about red and hulda and bill nolan i want to know what's being going on round here behind my back there has been too much going on behind every one's backs bob- bie cried and told him of red and hulda in the drug store the day be- fore of what hulda had said of nolan who had watched them and of the hate in his eyes when she had finished she said calm with the calmness of utter de- spair and now he's killed red and it's my fault for not warning him then with rising passion last night- oh i could kill myself talking with him- having him right there before me and not telling him there's another little thing i'd like to know about pitt broke in thickly his face a twist of fury what were you doing over at the  street amp smith's love story magazine mcmaster camp last night with- out waiting for an answer he con- tinued furiously what is this--- a race between you and hulda you've got to a pretty level when you play yourself against a girl like her for that double-crosser's favors the minute your father's out of sight running after him- she- she didn't run after red she ran after me the words came from honey's opened door and hearing them pitt's voice dribbled off into a half- muttered sneer swinging to follow his startled eyes bobbie found her own angry denial stilled on her tongue honey was standing there a wan white-faced honey with mussed golden hair and swollen tear- dimmed eyes her negligee trailed its froth of silk and lace about her her shoulders rose from it white as milk and her mouth was curled into a pitiful crimson droop like a baby's mouth soft with pleading oh pitt she wailed pitt i can't stand it any more take me away please pitt take me away from this awful place it does things to people- terrible things last night i tried to bomb the river bank the way old tim said up here at the cottage bobbie doesn't love you she told me so she said she wouldn't marry you ever and i thought- i thought maybe if i could give you the bonus money if i could bring you something big you'd love me so much you'd want to marry me instead then you wouldn't mind the old company you're so crazy after but i couldn't i didn't know how and then bobbie found me and i ran away-- her voice broke pitt laughed- a strange laugh that died against thin drawn lips you tried to blow a hole in that river bed because you loved me you thought you'd be doing a big tiling for me if we won the bonus you little fool didn't i tell you to be patient that i had a scheme to leave things to me doing a fool thing like that and now nolan who knows what's happened there murder maybe he swung on bobbie his face contorted his lips twitching you've got this much you might as well have the rest he snarled i've been gambling for a big stake and i've lost it's got away from me the whole thing money am- bition the girl a fellow loves those were the things i was fighting for and i didn't care much how i fought either but when it comes to murder- he broke off his expression horrified then why in heaven's name did red have to go sticking his nose into things that didn t concern him why didn't he do as any sane man would have done- let the bonus come his way and been glad in- stead of that he's been spying sneaking using nolan's girl to checkmate every move i've made watching everything i did- all her life bobbie was to remem- ber the sudden white flood of under- standing that swept her one-minute pitt was there before her his words a meaningless jumble in her terror- stricken brain and the next he had vanished wiped out in the flame that had burst within her a clean white flame that pierced the dark muddle that for so long had been her mind oh i know i know she was crying i've been so blind it's true what red told me he's been fighting for us- for dad and me- all this time just as he said he was you've never wanted to win primitive love  oh pitt honey wailed take me away from this awful place bobbie doesn't love you she told me so she said she wouldn't marry you ever you love me marry me instead that bonus pitt you and nolan have been behind all these terrible things that have happened hiding those crates that red found and brought back to tim trying to bomb the form sheds with the fuse that red found and stamped out you thought dad would turn the company over to you as he said he would and you could marry honey  street amp smith's love story magazine and have the company too you thought you could blame it all on red and you could have if it hadn't been for hulda and the fact that red loved me he loved me her voice swinging like a bell against the silence rose to a cre- scendo of triumph she flung her arms above her head and the sun sweeping through the open door flooded her face red darling you've loved me all the time oh why haven't i seen before how could have i been so blind she caught at pitt's arm don't you see she sobbed hulda loved bill nolan she knew what he was doing and she was scared she wanted to to save him she told red the things bill told her so red could keep them from happening she knew they could have sent no- lan to the penitentiary if they'd caught him and nolan thought she was in love with red and so he- he- a sob broke in bobbie s throat- a terrified ghost of a sob the glory in her face faded to a pale horror of realization and her words died to a whisper that lost itself against bloodless lips and now he's got red he's killed him maybe oh help me dear god please help me unconsciously her fingers were still clutchingpitt s arm he shook them free i'm after nolan he cried and his-voice trailed back over his shoul- der while his feet sent the gravel and sticks to flying on the downhill path wait bobbie wailed wait pitt and then she was tearing on her clothes smoothing her tumbled hair with mad hands lacing boots with racing fingers she ran down the path toward the bridge banging through the office door scattering papers where's pitt she threw at the startled faces that looked up at her wild entrance but even as she asked she knew what the answer would be he had taken the car and gone making no explanation she found tim he was seventy feet up in the air walking the scaffolding of the new arch direct- ing the pour the place was fever- ish with hurry filled with turmoil tim she shrieked i've got to see you tim he saw her and waved her away she started to go to him climbing monkeylike by the framework but a man's hands clutched at her and pulled her back leaning down from his dizzy height tim bellowed through cupped hands get that crazy kid out o here if you have to chloro- form her want the old man to come back and find her killed in a frenzy of desperation bobbie fought and struggled she bit hit and kicked then suddenly she quieted and the man s arms dropped from her her attempt to reach tim and the utter abandon of terror that had swept her at its failure had cleaned her mind of the fog that had held it she tried to plan as calmly as her pounding heart would let her every minute every second counted she mustn't lose a single one with her father gone with tim refusing to see her there was only one place left to turn that was- hulda if i go to her bobbie thought and ask her to help me find nolan she'll help me if i show her my heart and what's in it she can't re- fuse me she'll help me save red because she knows what it is to love primitive love  because in saving my man she ll save hers even as her thoughts took shape forming themselves into words that cried against her lips she was run- ning toward a battered old car that stood parked by the office door it was an errand car left in gear its engine running while its driver stood with hands full of packages half in half out the opened door she pushed him aside the impact of her flying body sending him gasping stumbling she climbed to the seat her foot hard on the gas she swung into a one-wheeled turn then she was racing away she heard some one yelling at her hey hey where you go- ing where you taking that car stop and she laughed her laugh trailing crazily back above the en- gine s roar chapter ix bobbie found hulda in the kitchen of the huge dingy old hotel she was alone the noon rush was over and she was washing the floor her capable hands were wet and soapy her gingham dress clung wetly to her and damp wisps of hair escaping from the golden braids that wound her head clung to her cheeks her eyes were swol- len with crying and marring the flushed beauty of her peasant face a livid bruise darkened cheek lip and broad low brow it was a hor- rible bruise that made bobbie wince and cringe nolan hulda said sullenly in answer to bobbie's stammered ques- tioning how should i know where bill nolan is that man carson came over here a minute ago too asking me the same thing i'm tell- ing you nothing i've done too much telling already for my own good and she touched her cheek her eyes hard nolan gave me that she said for trying to keep him out of the pen then with sudden passion i hate men they're all alike- beasts it wasn't until bobbie had blurted out her story from dry parched lips of what she had seen at the drug store the night before of nolan's watching hate-filled face of red's disappearance and the blood-stained empty car- that hulda broke down flinging herself in a chair she buried her braided head in her arms bill's done it she sobbed he threatened to do it he's killed red mcmaster he came in here last night drunk and swore he was going to get him and he has he's taken him to that shack of his up in the hills and he's- he's killed him and it's all my fault be- cause i tried to save him because i mixed in when i had no business to because- bobbie cried shack what shack where she shook the heaving shoulders she threw her questions down at the half-crazed girl repeating them over and over until hearing at last hulda raised her bruised tear-swollen face it won't do no good she said heavily it won't do no good to go there i know it won't it's- it's over with by this time whatever he was going to do to red he's done and if he's still there and drunk he'll kill us both as well bobbie laughed mirthlessly a lot i'd care what he did to me if he's killed red she said looking at bobbie silently for a moment the girl answered her rich soft voice heavy with the tears be- hind it a girl doesn't care much about  street amp smith's love story magazine how should i know where bill nolan is said hulda i'm telling you nothing i've done too much telling already for my own good then with sudden passion i hate men they're all alike beasts anything when she loves a man does she not even things like this touching her cheek again you love red i love bill he hurts me but he's probably needing me come i'll show you the primitive love  shack and jumping up dressed as she was she followed bobbie out to the car bobbie never forgot that ride on the logging road up the mountain side axle deep in ruts the acrid tang of burning forests that hedged them in the silence broken only by the scrape of the low-hung branches and the throb-throb of the car with hulda's soft gutturals to guide her bobbie followed the twist- ing way where the road wound round an outspreading cliff a path shot off a footpath which ordi- narily would have been hidden by bunches of sumac laurel and wild grapevines but now the vines were torn loose the ground was lit- tered with leaves and broken branches and caught on a twig and fluttering there was the torn sleeve of a man's khaki shirt like a sign pointing the way there was no need of words bob- bie stopped the car she climbed out and hulda followed her they put stones beneath the wheels bobbie said you'd better go first hulda you know the way i'll follow haste seemed to have left her an awful quiet held her in its grip paralyzing her fear the noise of her pounding heart and her labored breathing worried her in a strange detached way even with the tumbled-down weed-grown shack ahead of them at last standing with hulda beside its open door looking inside she still clung to that dreadful stillness it wasn't until she saw red- un- til she met his wide-open eyes and heard his voice calling her name that it broke that she found her voice and answered her name with his he was lying bound on a rude cot in a corner of the tiny cabin there was a bandage about his flaming head his face was white and hol- low-eyed and caked with blood and dust his clothes were torn but he was smiling at her with the tender - est the sweetest smile it seemed to bobbie she ever had seen but before she could move before she could reach him to sob out her pleas for love and forgiveness he was crying at her bobs quick find a knife and cut me loose pitt's over there somewhere and heaven knows what condition he's in and that maniac of a nolan's on his way back to the valley to burn the bridge and the dam- make a clean sweep of the works before he comes back here to finish up on us there isn't a minute to lose then she was on her knees beside him hacking with an old kitchen knife at the ropes that held him let- ting her lips lie for an instant against his chafed and bleeding wrists free- ing his ankles and holding him his long frame towering above her as he swayed stiffly and stamped the blood back into his numbed and aching feet over in a dark corner they saw hulda and went to her she was shivering and touching a sprawling body with fearing hands red pushed her aside and took her place for a long minute he listened then raising himself upon feet still unsteady he laughed that's pitt hulda but don't worry he isn't dead he's only out that bill of yours- he sure packs an awful wallop as hulda and bobbie looked at him startled he explained he came up here about an hour ago and tried to make nolan let me loose they had a scrap- about the prettiest scrap i've ever seen but there's no time to gas about it now we've got to bring pitt to and get  street amp smith's love story magazine going if we're going to save the bridge and the dam and keep that darned crazy fool bill of yours from running himself into the pen in spite of everything we can do let's get busy they brought water and doused pitt with it they shook pounded and thumped they got him at last groggy and only half-conscious down the narrow path to the parked car and pulled him in the blow that had felled him had been a ter- rible one his lips were green- edged his skin yellow paste in spite of his sickness he tried to talk drive like the devil he will try - the bridge first we'd planned one more go for to-night i've been crook long enough i'm coming clean he stopped ex- hausted then after a while we'll save those jobs yours and brent's if i die for it and what- ever they hand me i'm taking afterwards if honey still loves me we're beating it back to the east where we belong honey and i this is your world mcmaster yours and bobbie's not honey's and mine but red said nothing at all he was too busy his lips grim his eyes on the road before him his knuckles showing taut and white on the wheel it had been a long slow drive up it was a long drive back but not a slow one they teetered and tipped and swayed branches cracked above them the gravel flew beneath their flying wheels there was the roar of the exhaust the splutter and throb of the pounding engine the junction with its lights whizzing by like fireflies in the dark- ness and then the valley road un- rolling its dusty white ribbon before them it was on the ridge where through the break in the trees bob- bie had had her first view of the bridge that red slowed then brought the car to a sudden stop look he said good heaven look and following his pointing fin- ger bobbie saw what she had seen on that first and never-to-be- forgotten evening -the bridge- but not as she had seen it then a fairy thing against a moonlit sky there was  nothing fairylike about it now it was frightening terrible there were smoke clouds rolling up from it and long tongues of fire licking greedily at the black night sky even where they stood the smell of fresh burning wood came up to them to mix with the stale smoke scent of the heavy air for a moment they stared we're too late bobbie cried miserably while pitt groaned and hulda covered up her face with her hands but red was out of the car running down the hill and shouting back to bobbie take the car on down to the bridge i'm getting help tell tim i'll bring them along the river path every man we've got all the primitive love  pumps and hose step on it bob- bie tell him to keep fighting what happened after that was al- ways a dream to bobbie- a feverish nightmare of incidents crowding one upon another across the turbid background of a weary confused brain as they swung wildly into the circle of light that was their camp dark sweaty soot-streaked figures flocked about them hands grabbed at pitt and helped him to the ground then at bobbie they were tim's hands he was naked to the waist his thin ribbed body heaved as he talked dried tobacco juice dripped with the sweat down the crevices of his chin at pitt he croaked great supe you are where you been nolan fired the gasoline tanks if the blaze catches the false work we're gone he's crazy drunk we got him tied up down at the office and to bobbie his tiny eyes gim- let holes in his nutcracker face get up to the cottage an fix bandages and liniment and get a bed ready that darned fool yellow-haired friend of yourn- that gal from the city- she's hurt she found nolan and give the alarm just as he set off the pump and the flames got her she's hurt bad she- and then the old man was crying his face twisting the tears streak- ing his dirty cheeks the kid and the bridge the whole business he blubbered it's going to kill your pap bobbie if sandy was here now or red if they was fighting with me if- bobbie caught his arm look she cried down by the river path tim look they re coming -red and uncle sandy and the whole mcmaster crew they did come- trucks and chemicals men and water pumps hose and buckets they swarmed over the place flooding it red sweat-streaked his hair flaming crimson as the flames he fought his bandages bloodstained and horrible was everywhere snatching single-handed at burning timbers directing and giving cour- age to tim's tired-out men as well as to tim himself and sandy mcmaster became old sandy himself once more swearing at the blazes as he fought against them but bobbie back in the cottage where they had carried honey- the doctor from the junction pitt and herself- neither saw nor heard she was too busy there was water to boil oil-soaked clothes to hand to the doctor's motioning hand instru- ments to sterilize pitt tried to help he was useless his hands shook like a baby's his eyes were dimmed with tears he found a chair beside honey's bed and slumped there his head in his hands his eyes never leaving her small pain-racked face daylight was breaking when bobbie finding time to breathe at last leaned against the balcony rail and stared down into the smoke- filled mists below behind her honey was still at last swathed in bandages she lay white as the pillows that held her pitt on his knees beside her had his dark head buried against her hand the doctor was leaving his voice was tired but cheery his eyes smiled she'll be fine he said and she won't bear a scar they taught us how to treat burns right out at the front she'll be as pretty as ever once those bandages are off never fear  street amp smith's love story magazine pitt lifted a ravaged face and turned it toward them pretty he croaked man alive what do i care about her beauty beside her life that was when pitt had spoken for the first time lifting a ravaged face he had turned it toward them pretty he had croaked man alive what do i care about her beauty beside her life and turn- ing back to honey he had put his lips to honey's fingers and kissed primitive love  them one by one with swift tender little kisses bobbie was thinking of that now of the love in his eyes that had washed from them all the cruelty selfishness and greed she was thinking of hulda and nolan a sobered chastened fright- ened nolan- a nolan with the money she had given him in his pocket and hulda by his side she was thinking of the ranch her father owned out west where hulda was to take him and where her love would guide him and because she was afraid to think of red- afraid for the very agony of joy that filled her- she thought of her father instead not of the bonus he had lost but of the friendship he had won she thought of old sandy fighting shoul- der to shoulder with tim sweating chewing swearing and turning at the sound of footsteps on the path she saw them coming toward her dimly at first as though out of a dream with the mist swaying and swirling about them there was sandy and her father arm in arm there was old tim limping a little but grinning up at her his bleary old eyes squinting with the burn of smoke and dust and there was red tall and straight against the gray of the morning sky his blue eyes shining his bandages dragging crazily he was holding out his arms and smiling to her and suddenly the walls were reeling the floor was swaying and she was clutching wildly at nothing at all  street amp smith's love story magazine from an immense distance from some place millions of miles away she heard her father's catch her red the poor kid it's seeing me back like this on top of everything else that's got her hold her while sandy and i go in to honey tim you old ape what you staring at come along with us where's your sense don't you know when three's a crowd tim grinned and then followed robert brent and sandy and then red's arms were about her his cheek was pressing smoke and grime on hers and his lips with the tang of smoke on them were holding hers drawing at her heart drinking her in with breathless hun- ger and red's voice was whispering in her ears foolish senseless whis- perings they were not the things he should have told her- of the hunch that had sent robert brent from one train to another homeward bound before his journey was half over that had brought him back to camp to take a hand in the final conquering of the fire not of the reconciliation between his father and hers the long hand- clasp and the straight level meet- ing of eyes not of the crew of mcmaster men who were already working down be- low to repair the damage the fire had wrought nor of the reace for the bonus which was a race no more as there was only one company to win it -brent amp mcmaster- brent amp mcmaster this time to stay not of these things at all what did they care for such things as those this red-haired boy and this brown-haired girl locked tightly in each other's arms what red really told bobbie was i love you there hasn't been a day a minute or a second in all the four and a half years we've been apart that i haven't loved you i'll love you till the world stops turning and the sun stops shining and bobbie was saying- whipser- ing the words up against red's ear and i'll be your tomboy wife red because i can't help myself but sometimes i'll wear skirts dar- ling- grand skirts that fluff about me and i'll wind a ribbon in my hair and we'll close the door on all the world and there'll be no one but just us two together and the sun peeping up over the sky's rim found them there- a single outline- to shine upon and bless the end coquette a rosy petal fluttered down  where roses never grew  i looked up to the window ledge  and then i saw twas you i felt the nearness of your lips  and pressed them close to mine  their dewy sweetness left with me  the flush of rosy wine doris i bateman musical proposal by  leslie gordon barnard diane came in like something windblown from the garden the sunshine seemed to be imprisoned in her hair with gay tenacity mother isn't it marvelous a lovely day certainly diane but i mean- about robert imagine his turning up like this after years and years with just this week in town and then off to the east as soon as he gets orders from his office diane swiftly crossed the floor with a dancing step slipped onto the piano stool and accom- panied a snatch of song on the road to mandalay where the flying fishes play- mother- she sprang up again- if he should ask me you'd let me go wouldn't you i mean if he  street amp smith's love story magazine wanted me to join him out there diane how ridiculous mrs trench moved quickly to her daugh- ter's side she held a duster in her hand following up the inequalities of the maid's work and she seemed prepared to brush aside diane's ambitions which were quite as pre- posterous as dust on the trench furniture you've been seeing too much of him gadding about with him every morning noon and night this week he- he hasn t said any- thing she inquired anxiously not quite oh not quite- cynically diane you're imagining things you're reading into the affair what isn't there of course it seems very romantic his coming here like this after you and he played together as children as for the east- ridic- ulous mrs trench moved further on in her vigorous attack of the furniture she was a large woman and handled everything with a sort of repressed fury it was easy to see how she had brought her campaign with stephen trench to a victorious con- clusion only two years after the death of his first wife the mother of diane she was a good woman efficient in the main tolerant but without imagination she resented nothing in stephen's first wife ex- cept a strain of romance which she could neither equal nor understand as for the east- it was in the east that stephen had met eleanor agnes trench had resolutely set herself to crush a silly romanticism that threatened to crop up in diane besides how could any one see any- thing romantic in the east it was a place not of romance mrs trench assured herself but of fleas and privations and heathen gods and snakes that got under one's bed a most uncomfortable place per- mit diane to go east ridiculous the telephone rang for you miss diane mrs trench watched her daugh- ter go listened but could hear noth- ing then diane came back her eyes large and troubled it was robert he's got word to go he has to take the eleven-thirty train to-night and he'll be busy until this evening oh it's horrid- horrid mrs trench felt herself safe in offering motherly sympathy in- wardly she was highly relieved he'll be over this evening yes mother we'll go for a drive- and sudden color stained her satinlike cheeks her eyes be- came distant and her voice dreamy -he'll tell me to-night mrs trench's voice sharpened to-night she said crisply yes of course now let me see how appropriate a little farewell party for robert ice cream cake flowers and candles but mother we'd rather- there's mrs prosser and lu counted mrs trench quickly and grandma prosser if her rheuma- tism's better they all knew robert as a boy of course and george milson is sure to be there so attentive to lu and such a nice young man she sighed then con- tinued hastily as diane opened her mouth to speak and do look up aunt emily's number i never can remember it she and uncle albert of course must be asked but mother- diane you're not going to be un- gracious when i'm only trying to do something nice and appropriate for robert before he goes n-no mother mrs trench nodded approvingly and swept out of the room next to diplomacy arrangements were musical proposal  the breath of life to her she had she thought managed this rather well robert would have a chance for serious conversation with diane to-night only over her dead body why a thing like this would upset all her own plans for diane stephen trench coming home at five from the office found his house embowered in flowers from the gar- den his wife in her best gown and diane wandering about like a lost soul to look at stephen trench was to see a typical suburbanite set- tled down to middle-aged routine a bit lined about the face a bit dull about the eyes with a contentment that was built on successive resigna- tions only now and then stephen was different touch one certain chord in him and the man became alive embers of a lost youth flaring up in him he stood in the hallway survey- ing the proceedings have i forgotten a birthday or something mrs trench came forward briskly and with a half glance to- ward the drawing room and diane drew him aside explaining briefly stephen trench took off his straw hat and stroked the one wisp of hair on his head that still grew under careful cultivation with vaseline and brush but is it quite fair to them stephen you don't suggest that i am not doing the right thing no no my dear only- why they've only just met- at least for the first time since child- hood which doesn't count- and with him going away at once why should everything be upset i know young girls she'll fret and pine for weeks maybe but in the end wonder why she'd been such a fool and as for robert he'll find plenty of distractions out there you say he's going where mrs trench looked away the- oh out east in some out- landish place she hurried on it might be all right under other circumstances but with two such youngsters it's just a passing fancy and stephen i must ask you to back me up we must get them through until after eleven safely then he'll go away and with lots to think about he'll forget her but if they have time to talk he may propose something ridiculous and that we mustn't allow you understand stephen quite he said dryly she gave him a quick glance but her lips said i know i could count on you he tossed his hat on the rack and went out into the garden for all the filled bowls inside the paths rioted with nasturtiums on both sides hollyhocks waved in the breeze from the picket fence and leaves fluttered down from the trees at the end of the garden the wind was soft but restless so that he closed his eyes and remained still letting it sweep over him feeling old and despairing of his own courage she could count on him yes of course he was a fixture cemented in by a thousand acceptances and resignations he envied his wife her sureness her victories her energy feeling tired he sat on a garden bench his hands touching the wood felt a roughness his eyes went to it in a silly moment of course they had put it there carving it in the newly bought bench- s-e people thought it had to do with compass directions and took wrong bearings by it it stood for stephen-eleanor good heavens how long ago it seemed hello daddy hello dear he looked up  street amp smith's love story magazine thinking she's more like her mother every day she sat down beside him has mother told you about robert yes too bad he has to go like this just when you've renewed acquaintance it's the way of the world young lady he tried to speak lightly he knew he was be- ing a coward caught in the usual diplomacy and insincerity of pre- tending she said after a pause is it the- the way of the world to step on people deliberately my dear oh you know daddy you know why mother's doing all this having people in pretending to be nice to robert she's afraid- afraid to let us be alone so she robs us of the few hours we have i won't stand for it her chin was re- bellious he patted her hand your mother means well dear diane flung at him she thinks the east is all horrid is it stephen trench spoke only after consideration  the east is like the west diane -not all good not all bad we make whatever place we are in our- selves we create it with our own eyes our minds and hearts he paused then put a hand on her knee the east for me was a place of miracle but so was this garden a voice called from the house stephen diane could you help me please there are some things to be done they faced each other he patted her hand try to remember diane dear your mother means well she's done a lot for both of us how often had he said things like that extending to diane the bonds of his own subjugation yes daddy i'll try mrs trench with smiling mouth and unsmiling eyes welcomed them as helpers in the rearrangement of furniture everywhere one looked were the earmarks of an occasion she was determined to give robert a good farewell aunt emily and uncle albert came to share a hasty supper and aunt emily was taken aside right after and told the news uncle albert was not permitted to enjoy this confidence he had a frank manner that was disconcerting he never beat about the bush or said things obliquely or fluttered ex- pressive eybrows like aunt emily he was declared the sisters en- tirely lacking in subtlety though there were strange disconcerting moments when he spoke with his tongue very much in his cheek aunt emily unlike mrs trench was pale and painted pictures not unlike herself it was whispered that her genius was burning her out but the family doctor rudely said her consumptive look was likely to last out threescore and ten you did quite right agnes agreed emily of course i knew the pennels and robert once broke one of my frames with stones when he was quite a child but really his mother was- well you remember her- she was just a brunton as for this eastern business it is quite absurd agnes trench felt strenghtened she was most gracious to robert pennel when he arrived ushering him immediately into the drawing room calling sweetly to diane who had been sent upstairs for something unnecessary robert is here diane dear aunt emily engaged robert instantly in conversation she spoke in vague broken sen- tences full of incomplete signifi- cances the trend of which robert ls f musical proposal  for an instant diane and robert were together as he towered over her she smiled up at him her eyes spoke volumes though her lips merely said it's horrid isn't it all these people had not time to get before other guests arrived then conversation became general diane marooned across the room could only exchange glances with robert an adult and garrulous world had swallowed them both mrs trench in a strategic position kept a silent but impressive guard on diane's every speech or act as soon as george milson arrived she said they would play bridge do you think robert's changed much she asked brightly he seems just a boy to me still she turned to the guest of course i didn't live here then robert just visited with the prossers ls f  street amp smith's love story magazine everybody looked at robert assessing him your mother used to keep you very neat mused grandma pros- ser i declare she had your little pants out on the line every blessed day mother exclaimed mrs pros- ser and diane's were too asserted grandma vigorously she was al- ways goaded on by tactful inter- ference that was before your time agnes eleanor did her own washing then for myself i don't trust these laundries i- aunt emily interposed hastily have you seen the loan exhibit in town it's not- that is to say- the modern you know in conflict dar- ing but a little cold the doorbell rang at this point there's george said mrs trench with relief george how good of you we're just dying for some bridge i think you know every one oh robert this is george milson george robert pennel the young men shook hands from an obscure corner where he had hidden himself stephen trench sized them up george was a mouse-colored man eminently cor- rect in an artificial way against him robert's natural half-boyish ease warmed stephen's heart george milson was perfectly suited to lu he thought they would be cere- moniously married furnish their house with scrupulous regard to con- servative standards obey every precept of matrimony implicity and die respected and unknown outside their own street stephen trench sighed he had pretty nearly got there himself and it was all right these people were the backbone of the social order he had no doubt they hadn't enough imagination to go wrong you couldn't expect backbones to get out of shape sud- denly stephen laughed to himself but diane shot him a glance- hurt dismayed in the next instant al- most hopeful- and his humor died they were moving to the tables now for an instant diane and robert were together as he towered over her his eyes fixed on her she smiled up at him her eyes spoke volumes though her lips merely said i'm sorry it's horrid isn t it all these people stephen saw their young misery through these mutual smiles and he experienced a fierce pang a desire to jump up and cry out that this room these people this bridge was a sacrilege against youth romance and a summer night stephen mrs trench's voice brought him to earth will you fetch the punch dear you don't mind not playing do you and then you can chat a bit with grand- ma prosser the four younger people played at one table robert and diane were allowed to partner each other because after all they were across the table and george milson settled himself down comfortably opposite lu grandma prosser pulled up a chair and made remarks about the hands she could see tiring of that she returned to the subject of the guest of honor many's the time young man she told robert i've blessed your mother for trying to make a pianist out of you and diane's mother too many an afternoon's sleep you've destroyed fumbling up and down the scales robert brightened i've nothing much to show for it he said but i remember well enough diane used to sit at hers musical proposal  across the lot with our windows open and we see who could play the loudest remember diane her eyes flicked up from the cards to nod to him well now said grandma pros- ser we'll have to hear from you both by and by you'll have to have them play for us agnes robert and diane exchanged quick glances of dismay after bridge one might escape but if the evening was to drag on in the bosom of the family it would be intoler- able stephen trench from the door- way saw that glance and writhed inwardly he felt a sense of suf- focation as if life had him down and by the throat and went out into the garden for a sniff of air the eve- ning had grown cool and as he looked a faint glow in the north be- gan to grow and shift and change green spears of light moved across the sky changing extending con- tracting stephen returned to the drawing room drop your cards a minute he said urgently i want to show you something hurry he thought it's working they're coming mrs trench's voice was distinctly cool what is it stephen a fire oh just northern lights oh lovely sighed emily in the voice she kept for occasions that last bid lu said george why didn't you raise me i could have taken two more tricks easy as you please grandma prosser was staring with dim eyes at the heavenly phenom- enon once when i was a girl she began but nobody was listening uncle albert was taking the op- portunity to get a few puffs at a cigar he'd been aching for since supper agnes allowed cigarettes but not the heavier smoke well mrs trench spoke hur- riedly i'm sure stephen you meant well but our game- shall we she suggested brightly get back to it diamonds were trumps weren't they albert they began to troop in on the terrace outside stephen saw with a leaping heart two young people moving not toward but away from the door they were on the grass barely distinguishable now still gazing up at the mysterious lights of the north stephen's own gaze traveled up to them again they stirred in him an excitement as if he like grandma prosser were see- ing them again with young eyes he remembered lying in a canoe for a long summer night facing upward with eleanor silently watching now he watched the two figures on the grass their heads almost touch- ing their profiles clear and eloquent in the lovely glow from the sky stephen yes dear where are they who don't be stupid robert and diane of course he summoned his wits to tem- porize only seconds had passed oh there they are said mrs trench he saw her go heavily de- cisively across the grass my dear diane have you for- gotten our guests robert i'm sorry but do you mind it's quite chilly and diane is so susceptible stephen withdrawing a little so that his face should not be seen watched them return nothing had happened nothing could have been said in those short instants diane's delicately tinted face was pale and her luminous eyes showed distress robert looked politely im- passive as he followed his hostess in- doors for a brief moment his  street amp smith's love story magazine hand brushed against diane's their fingers interlocked behind mrs trench's back and then swiftly untangled themselves mrs trench summoned re- freshments early robert must take the eleven-thirty train and there was the music to come robert and i will serve mother no dear i've asked ethel to wait up robert may pass the napkins if you will robert they're right behind you stephen trench returned to his guests moodily helpless revolt within him a vast scorn for himself raging he glanced at his watch it was nearly eleven in a short time now robert must go if the on the terrace outside stephen saw with a leaping hearty two young people together they were robert said diane youngsters could only escape after the ice cream but mrs trench was watching that our time is so short she said taking robert's empty plate we musical proposal  must have the music we've promised grandma prosser do oblige us robert chopin mozart liszt stole into the room enticed by robert's fingers diane sat near by her face pale her eyes misty the boy can play thought stephen it's not making it any easier for her then robert turned grandma prosser will hardly remember my playing like that he smiled wasn't it more like this grand- ma he swung into a curious rambling improvisation one motif only re- peated with a fierce monotony then ended with a thumping chord then he looked at diane your turn he said a flush ran deep and red in diane's face her eyes seemed sud- denly bright and alive as if the music had awakened her she sprang up lightly seated herself and a crystal cascade of notes moved under her fingers she hadn't robert pennel's technique and power but this was fairy music abandoned gay irrepressible it moved and shifted bright and ex- citing thought stephen trench as the dawn then the music ceased diane turned to grandma prosser and this she said is more the kind of thing you had to put up with from me grandma with childlike thumping notes she gave her imitation con- scientiously fingering then with a glance at robert swung into a song on the road to mandalay where the flying fishes play- uncle albert then stood beside the piano singing it in a surprising tenor and stephen trench at first with diffidence then more con- fidently stepped up and supplied the bass the fingers of the girl seemed bewitched mrs trench caught her husband's arm stephen the car get it out robert will be late she was a little pale and distraught as if an atmosphere alien and frightening had caught her unawares he obeyed the scent of flowers and of gasoline mingled and the night seemed full of unanalyzed things he drove the car around to the front door seeing them all on the porch grandma prosser a little bent with her rheumatism george with his arm linked companionably in lu's uncle albert puffing a cigar emily contributing a languid smile and mrs prosser an eager one agnes trench dominating and repulsing one more ambition for diane no darling you can't go to the station uncle albert will go with father won't you albert we'll play some anagrams until you get back and then everybody can take a hand good-by robert good luck robert was shaking hands all around then he was facing diane good-by diane his eyes were intense his voice husky robert- oh robert she filing herself into his arms kissing him oblivious of the audience he strained her to him and kissed her lips tenderly my darling he murmured in a voice as poignantly melodious as his music diane mrs trench's gasp penetrated the air the night seemed to hold its breath at this shocking abandon certainly the group on the porch did diane drew herself from this public embrace and swung around to her mother  street amp smith's love story magazine but mother we're engaged i've promised to marry robert i've promised to go out when he sends for me come robert said uncle al- bert suddenly practical or you'll miss the train robert pennel did not move it's true he told mrs trench soberly i'm sorry if it seems so so sudden then he kissed diane again a long clinging kiss and was in the car stephen trench drove as if possessed the train was caught by inches but he squeezed robert's hand in a final message could you drive a bit slower asked uncle albert on the way back i'd like to finish this cigar he chuckled suddenly bless youth he ejaculated love will find a way old top stephen trench said nothing his sharp satisfaction was tempered by the knowledge that he had yet his wife to face the guests as he had supposed were gone the anagrams forgotten good nights said with false gayety stephen hearing raised voices quickened his steps diane was facing her mother and aunt in the room littered with rem- nants of a dead party oh mother how could you you tried you schemed just to keep us from those last few hours weren't you ever young don't you understand diane's young tones were ringing out passionately she broke off at sight of her father in the doorway stephen put his arm about her waist silently mrs trench saw father and daugh- ter clinging together facing her de- fiantly but it remained for aunt emily to make the capitulation for her sister it's probably all for the best agnes for the best repeated mrs trench slowly she looked baffled beaten then a faint gleam appeared in her eyes well she said decisively rising there is one thing i should like to know diane when please did this mad proposal take place diane went swiftly to her mother s side mother you're going to be nice about it aren't you i'm so happy and i do want you to see it's for the best like aunt emily says but when diane how- diane looked suddenly radiant it was grandma prosser's music she laughed joyously when robert and i were kids we used to play to each other across the lot with the windows open we made up a code so that we could talk to each other from the open window came the unmistakable smell of uncle albert's cigar and an equally unmistakable chuckle proposal by music said uncle albert in the bosom of the family well well mrs trench sat down suddenly in the nearest chair stephen dear she said shakily will you please fetch me a glass of water beaten as she was she looked once more at diane's radiant face her sparkling eyes and her defeat was complete she held out a hand to the girl i've heard some people say that the east is a romantic place she was admitting reluctantly as stephen returned with the glass of water

con- necticut  a m astrology can tell you only the planetary conditions and how you will be inclined the will to do and how you take advantage of opportunities is up to you i can see from your chart that it is difficult for you to make definite de- cisions and act upon your ideas you have the capacity to do great things with your- self but i believe your uncertain tempera- your stars and you  ment vacillation and sensitivity are handi- caps you are intelligent energetic and have good basic judgment now you have the cooperation of the planets for the next two years you should make changes and accept opportunities the first of which will probably come your way in the early spring act with more confidence seek opportunities expand your personality and make new contacts conditions in your home will not be entirely satisfactory but that should be a separate part of your existence which has nothing to do with your material advancement be wise and progressive star dust born february   maine  p m sorry but i do not omit birth dates except in unusual cases your chart does not correspond with that of the man you mention and i advise a permanent break there is a lack of sym- pathy between you and there is no doubt but that you will find some one who will appeal to you more than the current heart interest there is a definite break coming shortly anyway and changes in many directions i do not advise you to become serious with any one of the opposite sex for about three years- meaning marriage of course do not forget there is a time and place for everything under the sun write to me again miss m l l born march   in- diana  a m it appears very likely to me that marriage is in store for you folks late this summer the two charts harmonize and you have much in common affairs in general will improve for both of you and even though the economic problem injects itself and you think there should be a postponement i advise you to pro- ceed with your plans if possible mr c f w born january   ohio about  a m there is no doubt about your having artistic talent but i am sorry that you spent your money on a correspondence course i feel as if you should have had the benefit of class work and a personal teacher it so happens that i recall the marvelous art institution in your town and i advise you to consult an expert make no change in your plans be- cause i feel you have a future in the com- mercial field also you have just finished a bad planetary period and i am sure you will find more encouragement in future conditions it will be necessary for you to stay where you are for the present but you will have a change the latter part of the year mrs a b born february   arkansas  a m it was kind of you to write me again and i am sorry your reply has been delayed before i answer your question i wish to urge you to con- tinue your astrological studies you will find it helpful in many ways and your chart is well adapted to it there is no question in my mind about your instinctive healing ability and inherent knowledge of medicine it is too bad you were not able to study this in your early life and i am wondering if it would be possible for you to obtain work of an apprenticeship or assisting nature in a clinic or institution your intuition is remarkable and you can- not help from pouring forth your strength and giving yourself to each and every case i would like to see you do something with this unusual talent you have been re- lieved of great pressure in your life which has continued in one form or another for about eight years and now is the time for you to make a concentrated effort to im- prove your circumstances any changes in the immediate future will be beneficial do not hesitate to associate yourself with some one else who is established i believe this is your best way of becoming better known mrs e b son born january   pennsylvania  p m i answered you previously about your daughter but have just discovered your second letter about your son the answer to your inquiry about his talent is in the affirmative you are fortunate in having such capable talented children proceed with your plans for them mr w k born january   wis- consin  p m it has been impossible for me to answer your letter before now and i am sorry for the delay due to the improved planetary conditions you have had since last fall i am inclined to think you have obtained tangible results it is difficult for me to tell you specifically about this examination because even though your chart indicates improvement and fresh opportunities i do not know just how your own willingness to benefit by them has been demonstrated however i want to say that i like your chart you have balance a good mind that likes to go to the root of matters and your per- sistent qualities are very strong you have  street amp smith's love story magazine been operating under limiting influences since  which became critical in  and  most of that restriction and pressure from the planetary rays has been lifted and you can expect steady improve- ment in the future it is a question of building a new foundation for yourself so allow no opportunity to escape and make every effort to place yourself solidly you will have to work hard and assume respon- sibility but i believe you will be satisfied with results best wishes mrs jb born may   place not stated  p m the circumstances be- tween yourself and the man you mention in your letter are clearly indicated in the two charts there is an attraction but i cannot see you feeling anything for him which is deep and permanent neverthe- less there is another marriage in your life i think you will marry some one later whom you will like very much probably in  do not be hasty about under- taking the responsibility of his family com- bined with your own i believe you would regret it noel born december   michigan  a m it was kind of you to write me such a pleasant and frank letter i can see from your chart that you have not had an easy time of it but whom do you know who has not had his troubles in the past few years i can promise you improved conditions this year and in  even though they will not live up entirely to your expectations i hardly know how to answer you about this man you men- tion there is a strong bond between you and yet your natures are very opposite in many ways you have your impulsive moments but fundamentally you like security quiet and stability and i see noth- ing in this man's chart which would guar- antee security he is clever and intelligent but does not have the constancy that you do frankly i do not advise anything of a permanent nature but feel you would make fine friends mrs eb daughter born july   pennsylvania  pm your daughter is a very emotional type of girl but her chart indicates exceptional talent for danc- ing it is fine that you have started her education along these lines so early in life in mentioning her emotional equipment and her bursts of temperament i would say these will increase as she becomes older her chart also shows the ability to imitate and an inherent sense of showmanship all of these qualities will assist her in the entertainment world later of course the young lady is at a critical stage in her life as to health this is true of all children her age so i would not push her too much just at this time she will have oppor- tunities during the next three years to ex- ploit her talents and conditions will im- prove steadily i think she should continue with her piano lessons but suggest that you concentrate upon her dancing her chart indicates success in connection with motion pictures too m w born april   iowa  a m proceed with your plans to be an entertainer i think you would do well in that line of endeavor there is very little chance that you will marry before  o d m born june   it was nice of you to write me and express your appre- ciation of my reply i shall be glad to hear from

with the knowledge that it will have her full attention address mrs laura alston brown street amp smith's love story magazine  seventh avenue new york n y there are many likable young young men with adequate incomes who could take romance seriously and make the girl they marry happy but it would seem that these light-hearted young men prefer the flashy type of girl and apparently ignore the home-loving quiet girl who would make an ideal wife a girl would have to have plenty of courage to marry a man who con- siders existence a giddy round of good times and who does not realize that life and love have a finer deeper meaning far more important than any light-hearted gayeties of the moment roberta is in love with one of these flighty young men and won- ders whether any girl has a chance to be happy with a playboy dear mrs brown i am a girl of twenty-one well educated and although my father has a good business i have a job as assistant to an interior decorator i like to be busy and feel a little useful i am considered fairly good-looking en- joy good times sports and have many friends i suppose i ought to be quite happy but the truth is that i am miser- able you see i'm in love with a young man of twenty-five who is of the irresponsible playboy type he comes from a good family has always had enough money to do as he liked and is quite handsome like many young men of his type he is never serious the more girl friends he dates the merrier most of them are giddy flappers who should know better than to fritter their time away on a young fellow who will never offer them marriage about five months ago he went on a wild ride in his car there were three fellows and four girls in the party evidently they had had too much liquid cheer and they had a smashed car before they knew it fortunately no one was seriously hurt since then phil has quieted down some- what and promised to really behave we have been dating steady twice a week for about two months my parents like him a lot and as for me i'm des- perately in love with him but how can a girl trust a boy like that and if mar- riage does come along would he stay put it's hard for me to believe that an easy- going lively young man like phil is likely to really settle down i have often entertained the thought that as soon as this last escapade of his is for- gotten he will start chasing other girls again do you think i could trust him to be true to me i wonder if other readers have had a the friend in need  problem like mine and if so i would more than appreciate it if they would write in and tell me what they would do if they were in my place phil has asked me to marry him at the end of the year but as yet i have not promised because i think it will do him good to be kept guessing we are wonder- ful friends and get along fine my par- ents say it's up to me roberta when it comes to marriage my dear one can never actually predict what the future will bring how- ever a girl can tell fairly well what stuff the young man is made of from close association with him and his family many a young man with plenty of spending money and very little restraint is apt to go in for more freedom than is good for him but it is not proof that he can never settle down and make a dependable husband on the other hand there are young men who are apparently unable to take life and love seri- ously they are always in a rush and think they are having a wonder- ful time although the fact is that they seldom find real happiness if you and phil really love each other you might give him the bene- fit of the doubt and a year or so in which to prove that he means to keep his word about settling down by the end of that time you should be reasonably sure whether phil has a wabbly backbone or if he can be relied upon dear mrs brown i am a girl of eighteen and have been going with a young man for almost two years he tells me that he cares for me deeply and always in- sists on talking about the things we will do after we are married however i cannot say that i care for him in any other way except as a friend i have thought of married life with him and find that i would not be at all happy i know i can never learn to love him i have tried many times to break with him but he always puts me off saying that a girl of eighteen is too young to know what she wants and that i would be sorry if i ever broke with him but i don't think he is right i know that if i were in love with him i would be happy when we are together perhaps you will think i am young and silly but this boy and i are so different from each other he has lived in the city only about five years and doesn't like it much he sees absolutely no sense in dancing parties and other ways of enjoy- ing oneself it seems i like all the things he doesn't care for please advise me what to do don't you think i should drop him and have a chance to meet other young men and find a boy i could love alicia you may be young dear but hardly silly it is easy to under- stand that any young man in love would not like the idea of giving up the girl in question but surely he cannot be so blind as to refuse to realize that one-sided loves bring only unhappiness and that sooner or later a break is inevitable i'm sure we sympathize with him but at the same time it seems pointless on his part to try to force himself upon you when the whole thing causes you so much distress try again and this time be more firm tell him kindly but definitely that you are sure you cannot return his affection and that it would be for his own good for you to part if he should wish to see you sometimes as a friend it will be up to him dear mrs brown i am twenty years old i married a little over two years ago my husband is not quite three years older than i during the time we were going together we never went many places since we have been married it is more or less the same way sometimes one would think my husband was forty the way he wants to stay home nights sunday is about the only day we go anywhere my husband doesn't care for shows danc- ing or any kind of sports except hunting i never go with him then because he al- ways takes a group of men along i enjoy shows dancing and all kinds of sports especially swimming and horseback  street amp smith's love story magazine riding my husband seems to think these things are rather foolish though i don't see why i knew before we were married that he cared very little for the things i like but hardly thought about it then there is another problem which i have tried to combat if we are out riding with another couple and are having a good time it generally ends up with my hus- band's getting drunk and spoiling what lit- tle fun i manage to have i have tried drinking with him thinking maybe he wouldn't drink so much but it only made matters worse he makes a good salary and we have a car we could afford to have a good time together and be fine companions if he would only be more agreeable i love him dearly and he is as good to me as any husband can be in other ways than those i men- tioned mrs brown is there any way i could get him to take me out more and enjoy the things i do i have tried everything i know even to talking it over with him but it doesn't seem to do any good i know he loves me but i don't understand why he can't quit drinking and be a real companion i will appreciate any suggestion you make unhappy wife being married to a man who does not care for any of the simple pleasures his wife enjoys would be hard on any woman it would seem only logical to suppose that if your husband loves you and knows his drinking makes you so unhappy an appeal to the affectionate side of his nature would encourage him to be more moderate to be fair of course you must consider the fact that he is good to you in other ways as you say wouldn't it be possible for you to enjoy with a girl friend some of the sports you like and although your husband dislikes dancing it ought not to be difficult for you to arrange informal parties at your home every now and then and dance to your heart's content every husband should make an effort to join in at least some of the social activities his wife enjoys if the marriage is to be a happy one husbands should avoid making it necessary for their wives to coax and flatter them into doing things dear mrs brown when i was fifteen years old i was obliged to plan my wed- ding rather hurriedly my husband was five years older than i but we were very much in love with each other my mother was dead and until i got married i kept house for my father how- ever my husband's parents wanted us to live with them and although i didn't want to i gave in at that time my mother-in- law was running a rooming house before i was married my husband's mother seemed to like me and wanted me to go with her son against my father's wishes like a foolish child i didn't listen to him after i was married my mother-in-law treated me very well but when my baby was two months old she changed she couldn't be mean enough she wanted to show me what to do and what not to do about the baby saying i was too young to know anything then she started nagging me constantly insulted me in front of friends and even told the girls who helped her with the housework to flirt with my husband to make me jealous every time she got my husband alone she'd tell him all sorts of lies about me we lived with her for three years and then my husband and i moved away sometime afterward a friend of mine told me that before i married my husband got one of his mother's hired girls into trouble and that there was a child i knew this girl because she was still with my mother-in-law when i got mar- ried i asked my husband about this and he said it was all a lie and that he knew nothing about it my mother-in-law just laughed and said somebody was trying to make trouble by telling lies last christmas however i found a letter belonging to my mother-in-law it was from that girl and she talked about her child in such a way that i knew my hus- band was the father when my husband came home i showed him the letter and he owned up and said it was true but he said he never loved this girl and didn't want me to find out the truth he also said he couldn't pre- vent his folks going to see this girl and the baby the friend in need  the next time my mother-in-law came to see me i told her just what i thought of her i forbade my two children to go near her as she used to take them to her house and talk to them about me i told her never to step inside my door again i tried to be her friend but she didn't want me so i made up my mind not to care for her company she doesn't seem to know what friendship is anyway she has caused me only heartache ever since i've known her as for my husband he does not drink or smoke and is trying to be a man he tells me that he loves me and that he had never really loved any other girl before but i don't feel the same toward him i used to think there was no other man like him until i found this out i am only twenty-four now and i hate to think that my marriage is spoiled do you think i did right to refuse my mother-in-law to see my children every time she came she was looking for an argu- ment and meddling in my affairs miserable bertha whenever anything happens to disillusion us about some one we love life and love never seem quite the same but it does not mean that we must give up hope of ever finding a measure of happiness it is indeed regrettable when in- laws do not give two young people a free hand in working out their own marriage problems sometimes in- laws try to be helpful but their de- sire to help seems to turn into defeat and sooner or later other elements creep into a relationship that might otherwise have remained tolerable while it was not commendable on your husband's part to have evaded the responsibility of his former romance the fact that it all hap- pened before you met and married him should enable you to stay and give him another chance for your children's sakes no matter what the past may have been if a man tries to play fair he deserves an opportunity to prove that he is sincere dear mrs brown i am desperately in need of a friend's advice and as i have no mother to turn to i hope you will help me i can't remember any real happiness in life until a short while ago i am twenty at sixteen i married not for love but to be independent but my marriage lasted only three months and then i was a divorcee a year later i married again but i only spent seven dreadfully unhappy months with a man any woman could have it ended up by his beating me to the extent of putting me in the hospital where i stayed for almost four months of course i sued for divorce when i got out by this time i was heartsick disap- pointed and life seemed a failure how- ever three months after my second divorce i met an old school chum of mine and a week later we were married for six weeks we were divinely happy then i was rushed to the hospital for an emergency operation while i was ill my husband met a woman let her drive my car and gave her a valuable diamond ring that belonged to me several weeks after i came home i caught them in my car however i wanted to make a success of the marriage and did not try to cause trouble a month later my husband took the money i had to pay the hospital bill my grandfather had given me this money as my husband was out of work i later found out he'd lost his job because he had stolen money where he worked once more i was granted a divorce for the past eight months i have lived alone without faith in the future have i been the cause of all my failures i hardly think so here is my present problem just be- fore christmas i met a very charming chap he's only a year older than i we were constantly together for ten days then he returned to his job in another city i visited him for five days and have just re- turned however my mind is in a turmoil i am deeply in love for the first time and have dropped all other friends since i first met this man but he has heard con- siderable talk about my past there's al- ways some one to make my story a bigger one than it really is now he is very sus- picious and jealous of me he has told me he could really love me if he dared but he doesn't want to be hurt and he doesn't completely trust me if he only knew the heartaches and un-  street amp smith's love story magazine happiness i have been through since i was sixteen he'd know i'd never hurt any one regardless of how little they meant to me least of all the man who has made me want to make something of myself he has given me a new hope yet he breaks it down at times with an outburst of uncontrollable temper although he hurts me very deeply i love him so ter- ribly much i forgive him immediately how can i explain my unhappy past to him in such a way that he will be con- vinced i am really in love with him and that i am willing to live on what he can offer me we have decided to wait but i can't stand this separation and his doubts when we are apart i am true to him and have no thought for any other man won't you please try to help a girl who thinks she has had more than her share of hard knocks ermine it is hard to understand why it should take any effort at all to con- vince your friend that you are really in love with him surely having been married and divorced more than once in search of happiness should not be held against you i would suggest that you resume your former friendships or make new friends and do not cut your- self off from the companionship of other people it is always a mis- take for any woman to drop every one simply because she has at last met the one man perhaps if your friend could not feel so sure of you he would be less indifferent there is no necessity for you to apologize to him for your previous marriages if he really loves you the past shouldn't matter dear mrs brown this is an answer to socrates who has such a biased opinion of girls i hope you will find room to print it as it is meant for blue barney too the things i'd like to say to you soc- rates wouldn't look at all well on paper but of all the conceited boneheads you take the prize who do you think you are giving out an opinion like that of all girls just because you have met a couple who are out for a good time and nothing else there are plenty of girls who don't go in for petting and drinking at all and those who go in for excessive drinking and smoking are very much in the minority if you had sense enough to look in the right places you'd find your ideal of course you won't find her at the wild parties you speak of cheap taverns and places of questionable reputation how could you certainly no girl who has any self-respect is going to be found in such places and there are very few girls whom you will find sitting at home by the fire knitting socks for grandpa all girls want to have a good time naturally but not the way you seem to think they do there is much enjoyment in taking long walks through the country going to movies and dances and even sitting at home nights with a fellow who enjoys a friendly conversation personally i think boys are to be blamed for what some girls are boys don't care a hang about a girl as long as they have a good time if a boy takes a girl out and she doesn't consent to go to some dark spot to park and submit to his kissing and maul- ing she is considered a flat tire frankly i prefer being called a flat tire with ideas like yours you're nothing less than a simpleton i could write a lot more in this letter but i want it to be published a connecticut stenographer after reading a letter like the above there seems to be little doubt that some young men get off on the wrong foot because of their egotism necking and petting may have been- yesterday's fun but girls of to-day possess a goodly amount of common sense and the determination to stick to high ideals in spite of the fact that they are going places and do- ing things and here's another dear mrs brown if i were as narrow- minded as socrates and blue barney i might make an equally vicious statement about the conduct of most men however living in a big city has made me broad- minded enough to know that there are as decent men and women to-day as in our mothers days i say that sincerely al- though i've seen some very poor examples i am a girl of twenty and live in chi- cago i am considered verv good-looking and have a pleasing personality i am also sensible and practical but i must com- the friend in need  fess that i have had my share of unwelcome attentions from men who should have known better i'm a high-school graduate and because of poor business conditions i lost my job as secretary and had to take the first job that came along that was as waitress beyond city limits in a so-called respectable tavern in comparison to my previous knowledge of life i learned the cruder facts of human nature the people i met were of the wrong kind and i soon became disillu- sioned i distrusted all men i lost faith so completely that when friends called to take me out i preferred to stay home and read fortunately i told my troubles to an old friend he said i had no reason to feel that way because i was merely an on- looker while those fools openly petted in smoke-filled rooms and drank bad whisky he advised me to get a job in a different place pick my friends more carefully and especially stop being alone so much and avoiding all men friends i followed his advice at first i found that all boys expected you to smoke drink and neck until all hours however i discarded those friends and tried to find others right now my ideals are normal again i have met many decent young men and have many good times without cause for complaint my advice to socrates is to stop being a crab and look for friends elsewhere if he is really as nice a young man as he says it shouldn't be hard for him to meet nice people and interest himself in some equally nice girl i know that from now on i will continue to look for a man who comes up to my standards and i hope i have the patience because i've met many poor examples when i have no place to go i sew or knit and try my hand at the things that make a girl a successful housekeeper girls do you think it's foolish of me to wait and hope that some day i will find the right man i'd like to hear from any one who reads this letter i really think there are many good men left am i wrong babs i am sure you are not wrong in your belief that there are many good men left and i agree with you that it isn't fair to judge every one by the shortcomings of a few per- haps after reading these two letters socrates and blue barney will take time to think things over however here is a young man who agrees with socrates that nice girls are almost nonexistent dear mrs brown i don't know whether this letter will ever find its way into print but after reading socrates's letter i would certainly like to shake hands with a real man i agree with him that girls these days are nothing but playthings who revel in pet- ting and kisses drink paint and smoke like a chimney none of them have any com- mon sense every girl i have ever dated drank smoked and having a good time was her special interest if she met a fellow who could spend more on her than her cur- rent boy friend all the better and the old friend was given the well-known air with- out so much as a thank you socrates said that if a fellow isn't what the girls call a good sport and if he doesn't join in drinking like the others he is seldom asked anywhere his deductions are cer- tainly correct i don't care for liquor i could never see what fun people could have when they were tight and couldn't see straight as for easy kisses there's no glamour when a girl kisses every fellow who takes her out but that seems to be what the girls want girls also complain that boys get fresh and forget to behave like gentlemen girls may complain but they fall for a fellow just the same if only to add another scalp to their list maybe you'll say i feel this way because i haven't met the only girl i've met lots of girls but couldn't fall in love with any of them because i saw nothing to fall in love with i really don't believe there are any honest-to-goodness girls and the boys i know think the same i'm twenty-three have had two years of college and am now working in a con- tractor's office i'm considered good-look- ing and have been told i have a likable personality so i don't think that the rea- son i haven't found the right girl is be- cause i'm not presentable another thing that jars me is that girls lack loyalty they are pals when a fellow can take them places but when he's broke -well that's his hard luck and they openly admit there are plenty of other fellows who don't have to economize i have heard of only one ease where the  street amp smith's love story magazine girl remained engaged to the fellow after he'd lost his job and had to get on his feet again call that loyalty when a girl can't stick to a man because he's down so there you are girls you're always complaining about the boys but i'm at a loss as to how a fellow can find a decent girl a girl who has one or two old-fashioned ideas left and who would really be inter- ested in home-making rather than all-night parties busbee i believe i'll just sit back and let you girls tell busbee how he may find his heart's desire how about it family dear mrs brown perhaps my prob- lem may seem trivial to you but i would like to have your advice our home was broken up by divorce and i went to live with my father until two years ago when i went to stay with my mother since the divorce mother has been very bitter and now she doesn't want me to go out with any boy who is at all serious about me there is one boy four years my senior i am twenty he says he loves me and i am sure i love him but mother thinks i couldn't be happy with him because he is too quiet he doesn't care for dances parties or even card games but i don't really mind i was in love once before but the boy disappointed me terribly and now i can't seem to trust this young man as i probably should when he tells me how much he cares sometimes i imagine that it won't last or that he will get tired of me however at other times i think he is old enough to know his own mind he had had other girl friends before i started going with him he wants me to marry him at the end of the year but i really don't see how i can marry him feeling as i do besides my mother wants me to go out with other boys and forget him she thinks we are not well enough suited to each other of course i don't want to break with him do you think we could be happy to- gether if we couldn't then i might as well give him up now instead of letting him think that i'll marry him uncertain marion there is only one thing to do if you are not certain of your feelings for this boy and that is not to think of anything as serious as marriage at least not now no doubt your mother means well and understanding life so much better than you do dear she is probably right in saying that if you and this boy have such dif- ferent likes and dislikes there would be friction however just because your mother's marriage ended so un- happily it does not mean that yours will not work out give yourself more time to think it over and don't hesitate to have other friends if you can make your friend understand that you want to be fair and have his happiness at heart as much as your own he may not resent the fact that you are so undecided dear mrs brown for the past six months i have been in love with a girl who lives in the same house i have been out with her quite a lot and have told her i am in love with her however although she likes me and likes to go out with me she tells me frankly that she is not in love with me i'm quite heartbroken about the whole thing although she says she doesn't love me she leads me to think that she does her father doesn't like me because i have a quick temper and i can't go to this girl's home as we live in the same house however it's easy for us to see each other i am twenty-one and she is sixteen she's a fine sensible girl and always the life of the party when we are out to- gether i know i can never love another girl as i love her and i doubt whether i can be happy without her she seems to be quite grown up she admits she is fond of me but that it isn't love and has suggested that we wait two or three years to see how things turn out do you think that would be a good idea i'm afraid that if we wait she may fall for some other fellow later on should i ask her not to go with other boys won't you please advise me and tell me what you think would be best for us to do i know i will never be really happy unless she marries me willy of ohio i can well understand how dis- couraged you feel but where love and marriage are concerned it is the friend in need  only natural for a girl to hesitate when she is in doubt about her own feelings however you need not lose all hope that this girl will ever consider you seriously and waiting two or three years is as sound and sensible a suggestion as any one could offer in a problem of this kind by the end of that time you will both know how you stand in each other's re- gard but holding a girl back from other friendships would show selfishness on your part my boy and it would not prevent her from falling in love with some one else if you two de- cide to wait i'm sure you will find that a girl seldom turns down a young man who proves himself a generous sympathetic and devoted friend dear mrs brown a year ago i met a boy who was a night-club entertainer i can't say it was love at first sight because he seemed too much of a flirt he knew my sister and her husband and he came to our table for a drink ronny and i had a friendly chat and before we left he said he would like to know me better i told him i lived in an- other town and that i was going home in a couple of days and although he coaxed me i refused to give him my address in spite of the fact that i knew he could easily get it from either my sister or brother-in-law two weeks later my sister and her hus- band came to see us and i had the sur- prise of my life when i saw ronny with them he stayed more than a week and before he left we announced our engage- ment he wrote to me every day and i was the happiest girl in the world until i dis- covered that i was to become a mother all my castles tumbled i wrote to ronny and said we ought to be married at once but he didn't even answer my letter i hot hollywood news monthly street amp smith's picture play all news stands c  street amp smith's love story magazine almost lost my mind when i realized that all my love was just a passing fancy to him of course i couldn't let my folks know what had happened so i went to stay with my sister she lived in the same town as ronny's mother and his older brother murray my sister said i ought to tell ronny's mother how he had treated me but i couldn't do it especially as i really liked her she is a fine woman ronny's mother and i talked about the engagement but i didn't have the heart to tell her that i no longer heard from ronny or that he was responsible for mak- ing my life so miserable she wanted me to come to see her often the next time i went to see her i met ronny's brother murray we talked about different things including my com- ing marriage to ronny on the way home murray told me that he knew why i was so blue because the last time he saw ronny he heard the whole miserable story he said that ronny didn't want to marry me or any girl because it would spoil his career i can't tell you how that hurt me i sent back ronny's ring and said he could go right ahead with his career and that we were through for good i met murray again and he was very sweet he wanted to come to see me and take me out and i was glad to have a friend we became good friends one day i was cleaning house and fell from a ladder i had to go to the hospital my baby was born dead when i realized what had happened all my feeling for ronny died too when i was well again murray began coming to see me regularly but i couldn't stay with my sister forever and when i told him that i was going home soon he took me ia his arms and asked me to marry him i began to feel alive again murray was very good to me and what girl doesn't appreciate kindness when she is in trouble however although i love murray more than i ever loved ronny he said that he probably didn't have the right to ask me to marry him since i was in love his brother of course when i told him how i felt it was different but do you think that i should marry him knowing about ronny and me do you think he would throw it up to me later on i'm only nineteen and murray is twenty- five i want to marry him and live hap- pily but under the circumstances i'm afraid to take such a serious step your opinion will be greatly appreciated downhearted there is no reason in the world why you and murray couldn't be happy together unless of course you believe that he is the type of man who might indulge in the un- pleasant habit of bringing up the past whenever something happened to upset domestic peace knowing him as well as you do you should be able to determine this fact better than any one else a man must be indeed generous and understanding to really dis- regard the past and be interested only in the future many men ap- pear to be unable to reach this point of forgetfulness while there are some who never stir the dead ashes of the past why not give yourself a little more time to study murray it is better to take your time my dear than to rush into a situation which may bring you more grief if your friend can close the door to the past you two could probably be very happy together dear mrs brown about five years ago i met a young man and have been in love with him ever since he has often told me that he loves me better than any one in the world my parents however wouldn't allow me to go with him but i slipped out to meet him whenever i could and they never knew he is now twenty-five and i am eighteen my parents say i am not old enough to be sure he's the right man for me to marry and they are sure he isn't in order to please them i tried to be- come interested in other boys but every time i met jack i'd forget the others he seemed to feel the same way about me and would beg me to stop going with- other boys and go out with him only i usually did though we continued to see each other secretly then some one told my father that i was meeting jack and he made me promise not to see him again i began keeping company with a cer- the friend in need  tain boy in the neighborhood whom jack asked me not to go with but i thought that it would be a good way to forget him jack began going with another girl and drank more than ever he was in the habit of drinking though not to excess that is one reason why my father objects to jack i continued going with this other boy bill for a few months then i met jack again and he begged me to drop bill loving jack as i did i agreed i tried to get my father to let me go with jack but he refused so again i had to give jack up time passed and though i still loved jack i was lonesome and blue i had to have some fun so dad let me go with bill but whenever i happened to meet jack he always begged me not to go out with any one else during all this time jack had only a few dates with other girls but he didn't stop drinking when i begged him to do so he said he'd stop some day then i found a job away from home it gave me a chance to see jack often and we could go out without being watched we were very happy but some one tat- tled and my father told me that if i didn't quit seeing jack he would make me give up my job and come home jack was working at that time so we decided to get married then no one could separate us we even decided on the wedding date but as it drew nearer jack heard that he was going to be laid off and as my job was not going to last much longer we thought that it would be better to wait until we were financially prepared for marriage he didn't stop drinking but kept prom- ising me that he would after we were mar- ried dad wouldn't agree for us to go together so jack said what good will it do me to quit drinking i love you so much that life isn't worth living without you then i was laid off and went home one night jack was drunk and did some- thing that humiliated me terribly i de- cided that he would never stop drinking and that i might just as well give him up we have not had a date for more than two months but i can't forget him i love him and i know i'll never stop lov- ing him i have been out with bill again but there seems to be no solution to my problem the other day i saw jack again and he promised to stop drinking he said he hadn't had a drink for a week and tells every one that he has stopped drinking he wants me to make up and plan for us to be together always what should i do if i marry him i will break my parents hearts if i don't my own heart will break i can't live without him annette of michigan no problem is so hopeless that it cannot be worked out one way or another but time and a strong de- sire to iron out difficulties are neces- sary in order to make the remedy effective in the first place my dear if your parents object to your going with jack only because of his drinking then it would seem reasonable to suppose that if he loves you he would be eager to give up liquor and make every effort to convince them he is worthy of your love why not tell your parents that you would like to give jack a year or so to make good and that in the mean- time you will have other friends too that solution it seems to me would be fair to every one con- cerned it would give jack an opportunity to turn over a new leaf and show you he can be depended upon a man who is really in love will do everything within his power in order to overcome obstacles that prevent him from marrying the girl who has captured his heart dear mrs-brown i am a young sailor of twenty-one and if you can give me some advice i will certainly appreciate it ever since i was sixteen i have found a great deal of satisfaction in traveling and being on the go i went to england on a tramp steamer at that age and quit when i was seventeen then i joined the national guard for three years after that i joined the navy and i enjoy it as long as i can keep going here's my problem i am in love with a very sweet girl and would like to de- vote the rest of my life to making her happy however how can i settle down to married life when i have no trade i am really and truly in love with this  street amp smith's love story magazine girl but it seems rather hard to make peo- ple believe that a sailor can be a one-girl man i still have a year and a half to serve in the meantime we are both plan- ning for our future another thing that worries me is this although i am in love and would like to settle down at times i think i couldn't be happy because i would no longer be going places i suppose you will under- stand and not be thumbs down on me i met this girl three years ago and haven't thought of any one else since she says that when my time is up we'll be married do you think we should even if i have no job although we could fall back on the little i have saved maybe this doesn't sound like a prob- lem but i really have no one to ask for advice and i feel sure you will offer some suggestion i can follow smiling sailor judging from your letter it seems you have not shaken off the fascina- tion of wanderlust enough to be completely happy if you settled down on the other hand if you really love this girl as you say you may be so happy that you will lose all desire to be on the go the sensible and practical thing to do after you leave service would be to find what work you are best adapted to and stick it out while you are working you might be able to take a night course in some trade in which you are interested so that you would be assured of a steady in- come when you married give yourself more time my boy and be frank with your girl friend talk things over with her she will not resent your taking her into your full confidence dear mrs brown i met my husband when i was eighteen and we were mar- ried shortly afterward for a little over a year we were very happy then my hus- band was transferred to another town but instead of taking me with him he left me at his mother's telling me he would send for me as soon as he had found rooms but that very night he stopped at a hotel and took a strange girl to a wild party the next day he went to the town where he was going to work and became friendly with a woman he met they trav- eled around together for two weeks he never sent me a cent then he came to see me and stayed three days i was an expectant mother at the time he said he couldn't find rooms and that was why he didn't send for me although later i found out about this other woman and that he had lied to me after he left i went to work and when i had saved enough money to pay the fare i went to him the minute i saw him i knew that something was wrong he said that as long as we couldn't have a home of our own we might as well stop at a hotel but i didn't like that i found work rented a furnished room and tried to take care of myself he still lived with me as my husband one night i happened to find a letter he had evidently dropped it was from this second woman and since i've read it i have been miser- able then my husband told me the whole story said that he loved her and that the sooner he could get his freedom the better my husband lost his job on her account she went back to her own home state but corresponded with my husband i have some of her letters i thought i would keep them as they might prove good evi- dence when i sued for divorce but i couldn't make up my mind what to do i wanted my baby to have a father however my husband became friendly with another woman and went away with her by this time i knew i couldn't keep my job very long so the law brought him back and put him in jail he promised to look after me and begged me to drop the charges against him i finally gave in he said he still loved me and was sorry about the past he seemed so heartbroken over the whole thing that i thought he was sincere we left town and lived on some of the money i had saved up for my hospital bills we now have two children but i feel as if i'd rather do anything than stay with my husband life is so hard and mar- riage doesn't seem at all worth while my husband is good to me and as far as i know he hasn't tried to go with other women he swears that what happened will never happen again but i just can't believe him can i do anything to make my life happier mrs v c b it is a tragedy that marriage which begins with every promise of the friend in need  success and happiness should so often become a sorry mix-up but although ife is hard and marriage may sometimes seem not at all worth while it is our job to show at least a little courage and where there are children a special effort is required hard as it is and sometimes im- possible to rebuild broken trust no marriage can last without patience common sense and self-sacrifice sacrifices made for those we love are never in vain and sooner or later in one way or another loyalty and devotion begin to pay dividends so keep your chin up my dear evidently your husband means to make good his promises a little encouragement on your part will perhaps make the relationship still more agreeable try to forget the past it will not be easy i know but you can make the future so much brighter not only for the chil- dren and your husband but for yourself too good luck dear mrs brown four years ago i met a man fifteen years my senior i was eighteen then he is very good-looking and his folks are well-educated people bob makes a fine salary but money seems to mean little to him because he is the type of man who would give his last cent away to friends if they needed his help bob drinks and gambles but i don't really object to this because he never drinks to excess when we first met i didn't know much about him but after going with him for three or four months i found out that he also dated another girl but it was too late for me i was already deeply in love with him bob and i have been everything to each other he tells me that he could never forget me i know he thinks a lot of me and would do anything i asked him when my father died a short time ago bob attended to most of the details and he is always around whenever i need him however he cannot seem to forget this other girl i know she doesn't love him because the only time she dates him is when she knows he can spend a lot of money he takes her anywhere she wants to go this girl is teaching school and is supporting her parents and a brother another thing is that if she ever marries she can never be a mother and bob loves children bob knows i love him so much i would do anything in the world for him the difference in our ages does not matter be- cause whenever i have been out with boys near my own age they seemed silly bob is very proud that i love him as much as i do even though others may say i love him not wisely but too well he isn't the type that would talk about a girl he is very popular but doesn't seem to care whether he ever gets married or not i wish i knew what to do to make him think of marriage won't you please ad- vise me dotty to use an old axiom you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink i'm afraid dear that if your friend has felt no re- sponsibility to marry you so far it is very doubtful if he ever will it is sad but true that in most cases of this kind the girl is left-holding the bag while the man transfers his interest to some one else my most sincere advice to you dotty is to drop this man at once and give yourself time to forget the entire incident it will not be easy at first but later on when you meet a man who will really deserve your love you will be glad that you made a break real love never thrives on things that must be hidden from the rest of the world real love is open and aboveboard and is always altar- bound dear mrs brown i married at the age of sixteen after going steady for three years for four years we were very happy but my husband was in the habit of go- ing out about twice a week he said he had to go to club meetings or out with the boys and i didn't object then my mother died and about four weeks later a girl friend told me that she saw my husband at a dance with another girl i asked him and he denied it  street amp smith's love story magazine i told my friend about it and she said she had known for a long time that my husband was dating different women but she just couldn't tell me because i was so wrapped up in him as it often happens by the time the wife finds out anything every one else knows all about it he was always good to me and never objected to getting me anything i wanted one-nigh i caught him talking to a girl on the street he had told me earlier in the evening that he had to work that night then my husband left town and didn't tell me where he was going this girl left the same day although she came back in a week my husband stayed away for al- most three weeks then i received a let- ter from him in which he said that he still loved me and would send for me as he was thinking of staying in that town i didn't answer his letter and when he came back i made up with him for the baby's sake and because i still loved him with all my heart i think it's too bad that some of us can't help loving a man- when we know he isn't worthy of our love my husband still goes out on the aver- age of two nights a week but i don't be- lieve the excuses he offers i can't seem to trust him any more girls sometimes call him up right here at home and when he happens to be home the minute he hears the girl's voice he hangs up and tells me there was no one on the line do you think i should break with my husband we have lived with my father ever since i was married and i really would have no place to go i have no brothers or sisters and have never worked although my father and my husband get along fairly well my father wants me to leave my husband he says he will take care of me and the baby he is grieving over mother's death and i won't have any one if he ever goes he tries to comfort me by saying that if anything ever hap- pens to him there will be enough left to take care of the baby and me maybe all this sounds foolish mrs brown but i just had to write and ask your opinion and tell me what you think would be best for me to do i'm really un- decided about leaving my husband i sup- pose i feel this way because i still care mary de l but don't you think my dear that it wouldn't be quite fair to saddle your father with the problem of taking care of you and the baby when that is your husband's job it is heartbreaking of course when a husband disregards his wife's love and devotion but it would not ease your heartache if you were to break with your husband if you love him as you say you do it might help if you tried to reach a better understanding with him his actions in the past were not at all commendable of course how- ever if you appeared to trust him it might have a favorable effect and in time you two could again find a satisfactory degree of happiness to- gether you know mary there is some- thing in the old saying nothing ventured nothing gained try to make yourself more attractive and interesting and a little mysterious it will be more
