editor editorial and general offices ---  park place new york n y extravagant fiction today ------- cold fact tomorrow a new sort of magazine by  hugo gernsback   frs another fiction magazine at first thought it does seem impos- sible that there could be room for an- other fiction magazine in this country the reader may well wonder aren't there enough already with the several hundreds now being published true but this is not another fiction magazine amazing stories is a new kind of fiction magazine it is entirely new --entirely different--something that has never been done before in this country therefore amazing stories deserves your attention and interest there is the usual fiction magazine the love story and the sex-appeal type of magazine the adventure type and so on but a magazine of scientifiction is a pioneer in its field in america by scientifiction i mean the jules verne h g wells and edgar allan poe type of story--a charm- ing romance intermingled with scientific fact and prophetic vision for many years stories of this nature were published in the sister magazines of amazing stories--science amp invention and radio news but with the ever increasing demands on us for this sort of story and more of it there was only one thing to do--publish a magazine in which the scien- tific fiction type of story will hold forth exclusively toward that end we have laid elaborate plans spar- ing neither time nor money edgar allan poe may well be called the father of scientifiction it was he who really originated the romance cleverly weaving into and around the story a scientific thread jules verne with his amazing romances also cleverly interwoven with a scientific thread came next a little later came h g wells whose scientifiction stories like those of his fore- runners have become famous and immortal it must be remembered that we live in an entirely new world two hundred years ago stories of this kind were not possible science through its various branches of mechanics electricity astronomy etc enters so intimately into all our lives today and we are so much immersed in this science that we have become rather prone to take new inventions and dis- coveries for granted our entire mode of living has changed with the present progress and it is little wonder therefore that many fantastic situations-- impossible  years ago--are brought about today it is in these situations that the new romancers find their great inspiration not only do these amazing tales make tremendous- ly interesting reading--they are also always instruc- tive they supply knowledge that we might not otherwise obtain--and they supply it in a very pal- atable form for the best of these modern writers of scientifiction have the knack of imparting knowl- edge and even inspiration without once making us aware that we are being taught and not only that poe verne wells bellamy and many others have proved themselves real proph- ets prophesies made in many of their most amaz- ing stories are being realized--and have been real- ized take the fantastic submarine of jules verne't most famous story twenty thousand leagues under the sea for instance he predicted the pres- ent day submarine almost down to the last bolt new inventions pictured for us in the scientifiction of to- day are not at all impossible of realization tomorrow many great science stories destined to be of an his- torical interest are still to be written and amazing stories magazine will be the medium through which such stories will come to you posterity will point to them as having blazed a new trail not only in lit- erature and fiction but in progress as well we who are publishing amazing stories realize the great responsibility of this undertaking and will spare no energy in presenting to you each month the very best of this sort of literature there is to offer exclusive arrangements have already been made with the copyright holders of the entire voluminous works of all of jules verne's immortal stories many of these stories are not known to the general american public yet for the first time they will be within easy reach of every reader through amazing stories a number of german french and english stories of this kind by the best writers in their re- spective countries have already been contracted for and we hope very shortly to be able to enlarge the magazine and in that way present always more ma- terial to our readers how good this magazine will be in the future is up to you read amazing stories--get your friends to read it and then write us what you think of it we will welcome constructive criticism--for only in this way will we know how to satisfy you off on a comet by  jules verne scarcely a yard of ground was left unexplored the horses clearing every obstacle as if they were like pegasus furnished with wines introduction to the story among so many effective and artistic tales of our author it is difficult to give a prefer- ence to one over all the rest yet certainly even amid verne's most remarkable works his off on a comet must be given high rank perhaps this story will be remembered when some of his greatest efforts have been obliterated by centuries of time at least of the many books since written upon the same theme as verne's no one has yet equaled or even approached it in one way off on a comet shows a marked contrast to verne's earlier books not only does it invade a region of remotest space but the author here abandons his usual scrupidously scientific at- titude and gives his fancy freer rein in order that he may escort us through the depths of immeasur- able space to show us what astronomy really knoius of conditions there and upon the other planets verne asks us to accept a situation which is in a sense self-contradictory the earth and a comet are brought twice into collision without mankind in gen- eral or even our astronomers becoming conscious of the fact moreover several people from widely scattered places are carried off by the comet and returned uninjured yet further the comet snatch- es and carries a way with it for the convenience of its travelers both air and water little useful tracts of earth are picked up and as it were turned  off on a comet  over and clapped down right side up again upon the comet's surface even ships pass uninjured through this remarkable somersault these events all belong to the realm of fairyland if the situation were reproduced in actuality if ever a comet should come into collision with the earth we can conceive two scientifically possible results if the comet were of such attenuation such almost infinitesimal mass as some of these celestial wanderers seem to be we can imagine our earth self- protective and possibly unharmed if on the other hand the comet had even a hundredth part of the size and solidity and weight which verne confers upon his monster so as to give his travelers a home-- in that case the collision woidd be unspeakably dis- astrous--especially to the unlucky individuals who occupied the exact point of contact but once granted the initial and the closing ex- travagance the departure and return of his charac- ters the alpha and omega of his tale hoxo closely the author clings to facts between how closely he fol- lows and imparts to his readers the scientific proba- bilities of the universe beyond our earth the actual knoivledge so hard won by our astronomers other authors who since verne have told of trips through the planetary and stellar universe have given free rein to fancy to dreams of what might be found verne has endeavored to impart only what is known to exist in the same year with off on a comet  was published also the tale variously named and trans- lated as the black indies the underground city and the child of the cavern this story like round the world in eighty days was first issued in feuilleton by the noted paris newspaper le temps its success did not equal that of its predecessor in this style some critics indeed have pointed to this work as marking the beginning of a decline in the author's pou'er of awaking interest many of his best works were however still to follow off on a comet or hector servadac by  jules verne book i chapter i a challenge nothing sir can induce me to surrender my claim i am sorry count but in such a mat- ter your views cannot modify mine but allow me to point out that my seniority unquestionably gives me a prior right mere seniority i assert in an affair of this kind cannot possibly entitle you to any prior claim what- ever then captain no alternative is left but for me to compel you to yield at the sword's point as you please count but neither sword nor pistol can force me to forego my pretensions here is my card and mine this rapid altercation was thus brought to an end by the formal interchange of the names of the disputants on one of the cards was inscribed captain hector servadac staff officer mostaganem on the other was the title count wassili timascheff on board the schooner udobryna it did not take long to arrange that seconds should be appointed who would meet in mostaga- nem at two o'clock that day and the captain and the count were on the point of parting from each other with a salute of punctilious courtesy when timascheff as if struck by a sudden thought said abruptly perhaps it would be better captain not to allow the real cause of this to transpire far better replied servadac it is undesirable in every way for any names to be mentioned in that case however continued the count it will be necessary to assign an ostensible pretext of some kind shall we allege a musical dispute-- a contention in which i feel bound to defend wag- ner while you are the zealous champion of ros- sini i am quite content answered servadac with a smile and with another low bow they parted the scene as here depicted took place upon the extremity of a little cape on the algerian coast between mostaganem and tenes about two miles from the mouth of the shelif the headland rose more than sixty feet above the sea-level and the azure waters of the mediterranean as they softly kissed the strand were tinged with the reddish hue of the ferriferous rocks that formed its base it was the st of december the noontide sun which usually illuminated tftie various projections of the coast with a dazzling brightness was hidden by a dense mass of cloud and the fog which for some unaccountable cause had hung for the last two months over nearly every region in the world caus- ing serious interruption to traffic between continent and continent spread its dreary veil across land and sea after taking leave of the staff-officer count wassili timascheff wended his way down to a small creek and took his seat in the stern of a light four-oar that had been awaiting his return this was immediately pushed off from shore and was soon alongside a pleasure-yacht that was lying to not many cable lengths away at a sign from servadac an orderly who had been standing at a respectful distance led forward a magnificent arabian horse the captain vaulted into the saddle and followed by his attendant well mounted as himself started off towards mostag- anem it was half-past twelve when the two riders crossed the bridge that had been recently erected over the shelif and a quarter of an hour later their  amazing stories steeds flecked with foam dashed through the mas- cara gate which was one of five entrances opened in the embattled wall that encircled the town at that date mostaganem contained about fifteen thousand inhabitants three thousand of whom were french besides being one of the principal district towns of the province of oran it was also a military station mostaganem rejoiced in a well- sheltered harbor which enabled it to utilize all the rich products of the mina and the lower shelif it was the existence of so good a harbor amidst the exposed cliffs of this coast that had induced the owner of the dobryna to winter in these parts and for two months the russian standard had been seen floating from her yard whilst on her mast-head was hoisted the pennant of the french yacht club with the distinctive letters m c w t the initials of count timascheff having entered the town captain servadac made his way towards matmore the military quarter and was not long in finding two friends on whom he might rely--a major of the nd fusileers and a captain of the th artillery the two officers list- ened gravely enough to servadac's request that they would act as his seconds in an affair of honor but could not resist a smile on hearing that the dispute between him and the count had originated in a mu- sical discussion surely they suggested the matter might be easily arranged a few slight concessions on either side and all might be amicably adjusted but no representations on their part were of any avail hector servadac was inflexible no concession is possible he replied resolutely rossini has been deeply injured and i cannot suf- fer the injury to be unavenged wagner is a fool i shall keep my word i am quite firm be it so then replied one of the officers and after all you know a sword-cut need not be a very serious affair certainly not rejoined servadac and espe- cially in my case when i have not the slightest intention of being wounded at all incredulous as they naturally were as to the assigned cause of the quarrel servadac's friends had no alternative but to accept his explanation and without further parley they started for the staff office where at two o'clock precisely they were to meet the seconds of count timascheff two hours later they had returned all the prelimin- aries had been arranged the count who like many russians abroad was an aide-de-camp of the czar had of course proposed swords as the most appro- priate weapons and the duel was to take place on the following morning the first of january at nine o'clock upon the cliff at a spot about a mile and a half from the mouth of the shelif with the as- surance that they would not fail to keep their appointment with military punctuality the two offi- cers cordially wrung their friend's hand and retired to the zulma cafe for a game at piquet captain servadac at once retraced his steps and left the town for the last fortnight servadac had not been occupying his proper lodgings in the military quar- ters having been appointed to make a local levy he had been living in a gourbi or native hut on the mostaganem coast between four and five miles from the shelif his orderly was his sole com- panion and by any other man than the captain the enforced exile would have been esteemed little short of a severe penance on his way to the gourbi his mental occupation was a very laborious effort to put together what he was pleased to call a rondo upon a model of versi- fication all but obsolete this rondo it is unneces- sary to coneal was to be an ode addressed to a young widow by whom he had been captivated and whom he was anxious to marry and the tenor of his muse was intended to prove that when once a man has found an object in all respects worthy of his af- fections he should love her in all simplicity whether the aphorism was universally true was not very material to the gallant captain whose sole ambition at present was to construct a roundelay of which this should be the prevailing sentiment he indulged the fancy that he might succeed in produc- ing a composition which would have a fine effect here in algeria where poetry in that form was all but unknown i know well enough he said repeatedly to him- self what i want to say i want to tell her that i love her sincerely and wish to marry her but confound it the words won't rhyme plague on it does nothing rhyme with simplicity ah i have it now lovers should whoe'er they be love in all simplicity but what next how am i to go on i say ben zoof he called aloud to his orderly who was trot- ting silently close in his rear did you ever compose any poetry no captain answered the man promptly i have never made any verses but i have seen them made fast enough at a booth during the fete of montmartre can you remember them remember them to be sure i can this is the way they began come in come in you'll not repent the entrance money you have spent the wondrous mirror in this place reveals your future sweetheart's face  bosh cried servadac in disgust your verses are detestable trash as good as any others captain squeaked through a reed pipe hold your tongue man said servadac per- emptorily i have made another couplet lovers should whoe'er they be love in all simplicity lover loving honestly offer i myself to thee beyond this however the captain's poetical genius was impotent to carry him his further ef- forts were unavailing and when at six o'clock he reached the gourbi the four lines still remained the limit of his composition chapter ii captain servadac and his orderly at the time of which i write there might be seen in the registers of the minister of war the following entry servadac hector born at st trelody in the district of lesparre department of the gironde july th -- property  francs in rentes off on a comet  length of service fourteen years three months and five days v service two years at school at st cyr two years at l'escole d'application two years in the th regiment of the line two years in the rd light cavalry seven years in algeria campaigns soudan and japan rank captain on the staff at mostaganem decorations chevalier of the legion of honor march th -- hector servadac was thirty years of age an orphan without lineage and almost without means thirsting for glory rather than for gold slightly scatter-brained but warm-hearted generous and brave he was eminently fitted to be the proteg of the god of battles for the first year and a half of his existence he had been the foster-child of the sturdy wife of a vine-dresser of medoc--a lineal descendant of the heroes of ancient prowess in a word he was one of those individuals whom nature seems to have predestined for remarkable things and around whose cradle have hovered the fairy god-mothers of adventure and good luck in appearance hector servadac was quite the type of an officer he was rather more than five feet six inches high slim and graceful with dark curling hair and mustaches well-formed hands and feet and a clear blue eye he seemed born to please without being conscious of the power he possessed it must be owned and no one was more ready to confess it than himself that his literary attain- ments were by no means of a high order we don't spin tops is a favorite saying amongst artillery officers indicating that they do not shirk their duty for frivolous pursuits but it must be confessed that servadac being naturally idle was very much given to spinning tops his good abilities however and his ready intelligence had carried him success- fully through the curriculum of his early career he was a good draughtsman an excellent rider-- having thoroughly mastered the successor to the fa- mous uncle tom at the riding-school of st cyr --and in the records of his military service his name had several times been included in the order of the day the following episode may suffice in a certain degree to illustrate his character once in action he was leading a detachment of infantry through an intrenchment they came to a place where the side-work of the trench had been so riddled by shell that a portion of it had actually fallen in leaving an aperture quite unsheltered from the grape-shot that was pouring in thick and fast the men hesi- tated in an instant servadac mounted the side- work laid himself down in the gap and thus filling up the breach by his own body shouted march on and through a storm of shot not one of which touched the prostrate officer the troop passed in safety since leaving the military college servadac with the exception of his two campaigns in the soudan and japan had been always stationed in algeria he had now a staff appointment at mostaganem and had lately been entrusted with some topograph- ical work on the coast between tenes and the shelif it was a matter of little consequence to him that the gourbi in which of necessity he was quartered was uncomfortable and ill-contrived he loved the open air and the independence of his life suited him well sometimes he would wander on foot upon the sandy shore and sometimes he would enjoy a ride along the summit of the cliff altogether being in no hurry at all to bring his task to an end his occupation moreover was not so engrossing but that he could find leisure for taking a short railway journey once or twice a week so that he was ever and again putting in an appearance at the general's receptions at oran and at the fetes given by the governor at algiers it was on one of these occasions that he had first met madame de l- the lady to whom he was desirous of dedicating the rondo the first four lines of which had just seen the light she was a colonel's widow young and handsome very reserved not to say haughty in her manner and either indifferent or impervious to the admiration which she inspired captain servadac had not yet ventured to declare his attachment of rivals he was well aware he had not a few and amongst these not the least formid- able was the russian count timasheff and although the young widow was all unconscious of the share she had in the matter it was she and she alone who was the cause of the challenge just given and accepted by her two ardent admirers during his residence in the gourbi hector serva- dac's sole companion was his orderly ben zoof ben zoof was devoted body and soul to his superior officer his own personal ambition was so entirely absorbed in his master's welfare that it is certain no offer of promotion--even had it been that of aide-de-camp to the governor-general of algiers-- would have induced him to quit that master's serv- ice his name might seem to imply that he was a native of algeria but such was by no means the case his true name was laurent he was a native of montmartre in paris and how or why he had obtained his patronymic was one of those anomalies which the most sagacious of etymologists would find it hard to explain born on the hill of montmartre between the solferino tower and the mill of la galette ben zoof had ever possessed the most unreserved ad- miration for his birthplace and to his eyes the heights and district of montmartre represented an epitome of all the wonders of the world in all his travels and these had been not a few he had never beheld scenery which could compete with that of his native home no cathedral--not even burgos itself --could vie with the church at montmartre its race-course could well hold its own against that at pentelique its reservoir would throw the mediter- ranean into the shade its forests had flourished long before the invasion of the celts and its very mill produced no ordinary flour but provided ma- terial for cakes of world-wide renown to crown all montmartre boasted a mountain--a veritable mountain envious tongues indeed might pronounce it little more than a hill but ben zoof would have allowed himself to be hewn in pieces rather than admit that it was anything less than fifteen thou- sand feet in height ben zoof's most ambitious desire was to induce the captain to go with him and end his days in his much-loved home and so incessantly were serva-  amazing stories dac's ears besieged with descriptions of the unpar- alleled beauties and advantages of this eighteenth arrondissement of paris that he could scarcely hear the name of montmartre without a conscious thrill of aversion ben zoof however did not des- pair of ultimately converting the captain and meanwhile had resolved never to leave him when a private in the th cavalry he had been on the point of quitting the army at twenty-eight years of age but unexpectedly he had been appointed orderly to captain servadac side by side they fought in two campaigns servadac had saved ben zoof's life in japan ben zoof had rendered his master a like service in the soudan the bond of union thus effected could never be severed and although ben zoof's achievements had fairly earned him the right of retirement he firmly declined all honors or any pension that might part him from his superior officer two stout arms an iron constitu- tion a powerful frame and an indomitable courage were all loyally devoted to his master's service and fairly entitled him to his soi-disant designation or the rampart of montmartre unlike his master he made no pretension to any gift of poetic power but his inexhaustible memory made him a living en- cycloptedia and for his stock of anecdotes and troopers's tales he was matchless thoroughly appreciating his servant's good qual- ities captain servadac endured with imperturbable good humor those idiosyncrasies which in a less faithful follower would have been intolerable and from time to time he would drop a word of sympa- thy that served to deepen his subordinate's devotion on one occasion when ben zoof had mounted his hobby-horse and was indulging in high-flown praises about his beloved eighteenth arrondisse- ment the captain had remarked gravely do you know ben zoof that montmartre only requires a matter of some thirteen thousand feet to make it as high as mont blanc ben zoof's eyes glistened with delight and from that moment hector servadac and montmartre held equal places in his affection chapter iii interrupted effusions composed of mud and loose stones and covered with a thatch of turf and straw known to the na- tives by the name of driss the gourbi though a grade better than the tents of the nomad arabs was yet far inferior to any habitation built of brick or stone it adjoined an old stone hostelry previously occupied by a detachment of engineers and which now afforded shelter for ben zoof and the two horses it still contained a considerable number of tools such as mattocks shovels and pick-axes uncomfortable as was their temporary abode servadac and his attendant made no complaints neither of them was dainty in the matter either of board or lodging after dinner leaving his orderly to stow away the remains of the repast in what he was pleased to term the cupboard of his stomach captain servadac turned out into the open air to smoke his pipe upon the edge of the cliff the shades of night were drawing on an hour previ- ously veiled in heavy clouds the sun had sunk below the horizon that bounded the plain beyond the shelif the sky presented a most singular appearance towards the north although the darkness rendered it impossible to see beyond a quarter of a mile the upper strata of the atmosphere were suffused with a rosy glare no well-defined fringe of light nor arch of luminous rays betokened a display of aurora borealis even had such a phenomenon been possible in these latitudes and the most experienced meteor- ologist would have been puzzled to explain the cause of this striking illumination on this st of decem- ber the last evening of the passing year but captain servadac was no meteorologist and it is to be doubted whether since leaving school he had ever opened his course of cosmography besides he had other thoughts to occupy his mind the prospects of the morrow offered serious matter for consideration the captain was actuated by no personal animosity against the count though rivals the two men regarded each other with sin- cere respect they had simply reached a crisis in which one of them was de trop which of them fate must decide at eight o'clock captain servadac re-entered the gourbi the single apartment of which contained his bed a small writing-table and some trunks that served instead of cupboards the orderly perform- ed his culinary operations in the adjoining build- ing which he also used as a bed-room and where extended on what he called his good oak mattress he would sleep soundly as a doormouse for twmve hours at a stretch ben zoof had not yet received his orders to retire and ensconcing himself in a corner of the gourbi he endeavored to doze--a task which the unusual agitation of his master rendered somewhat difficult captain servadac was evidently in no hurry to betake himself to rest but seating himself at his table with a pair of compasses and a sheet of drawing-paper he began to draw with red and blue crayons a variety of colored lines which could hardly be supposed to have much connection with a topographical survey in truth his char- acter of staff-officer was now entirely absorbed in that of gascon poet whether he imagined that the compasses would bestow upon his verses the meas- ure of a mathematical accuracy or whether he fan- cied that the parti-colored lines would lend variety to his rhythm it is impossible to determine be that as it may he was devoting all his energies to the compilation of his rondo and supremely difficult he found the task hang it he ejaculated whatever induced me to choose this meter it is as hard to find rhymes as to rally fugitives in a battle but by all the powers it shan't be said that a french officer cannot cope with a piece of poetry one battalion has fought--now for the rest perseverance had its reward presently two lines one red the other blue appeared upon the paper and the captain murmured words mere words cannot avail telling true heart's tender tale what on earth ails my master muttered ben zoof for the last hour he has been as fidgety as a bird returning after its winter migration servadac suddenly started from his seat and as off on a comet  he paced the room with all the frenzy of poetic in- spiration read out empty words cannot convey all a lover's heart would say well to be sure he is at his everlasting verses again said ben zoof to himself as he roused him- self in his corner impossible to sleep in such a noise and he gave vent to a loud groan how now ben zoof said the captain sharply what ails you nothing sir only the nightmare curse the fellow he has quite interrupted me ejaculated the captain ben zoof he called aloud here sir was the prompt reply and in an instant the orderly was upon his feet standing in a military attitude one hand to his forehead the other closely pressed to his trouser-seam stay where you are don't move an inch shouted servadac i have just thought of the end of my rondo and in a voice of inspiration accompanying his words with dramatic gestures servadac began to declaim listen lady to my vows--  consent to be my spouse constant ever i will be constant     no closing lines were uttered all at once with unutterable violence the captain and his orderly were dashed face downwards to the ground chapter iv a convulsion of nature whence came it that at that very moment the horizon underwent so strange and sudden a modi- fication that the eye of the most praticed mariner could not distinguish between sea and sky whence came it that the billows raged and rose to a height hitherto unregistered in the records of science whence came it that the elements united in one deafening crash that the earth groaned as though the whole framework of the globe were ruptured that the waters roared from their innermost depths that the air shrieked with all the fury of a cyclone whence came it that a radiance intenser than the effulgence of the northern lights overspread the firmament and momentarily dimmed the splen- dor of the brightest stars whence came it that the mediterranean one in- stant emptied of its waters was the next flooded with a foaming surge whence came it that in the space of a few sec- onds the moon's disc reached a magnitude as though it were but a tenth part of its ordinary distance from the earth whence came it that a new blazing spheroid hitherto unknown to astronomy now appeared sud- denly in the firmament though it were but to lose itself immediately behind masses of accumulated cloud what phenomenon was this that had produced a cataclysm so tremendous in effect upon earth sky and sea was it possible that a single human being could have survived the convulsion and if so could he explain its mystery chapter v a mysterious sea violent as the commotion had been that por- tion of the algerian coast which is bounded on the north by the mediterranean and on the west by the right bank of the shelif appeared to have suf- fered little change it is true that indentations were perceptible in the fertile plain and the sur- face of the sea was ruffled with an agitation that was quite unusual but the rugged outline of the cliff was the same as heretofore and the aspect of the entire scene appeared unaltered the stone hostelry with the exception of some deep clefts in its walls had sustained little injury but the gourbi like a house of cards destroyed by an infant's breath had completely subsided and its two in- mates lay motionless buried under the sunken thatch it was two hours after the catastrophe that cap- tain servadac regained consciousness he had some trouble to collect his thoughts and the first sounds that escaped his lips were the concluding words of the rondo which had been so ruthlessly interrupted constant ever i will be constant     his next thought was to wonder what had hap- pened and in order to find an answer he pushed aside the broken thatch so that his head appeared above the debris the gourbi leveled to the ground he exclaimed surely a waterspout has passed along the coast he felt all over his body to perceive what injuries he had sustained but not a sprain nor a scratch could he discover where are you ben zoof he shouted here sir and with military promptitude a second head protruded from the rubbish have you any notion what has happened ben zoof i've a notion captain that it's all up with us nonsense ben zoof it is nothing but a water- spout very good sir was the philosophical reply immediately followed by the query any bones broken sir none whatever said the captain both men were soon on their feet and began to make a vigorous clearance of the ruins beneath which they found that their arms cooking utensils and other property had sustained little injury by-the-by what o'clock is it asked the cap- tain it must be eight o'clock at least said ben zoof looking at the sun which was a considerable height above the horizon it is almost time for us to start to start what for to keep your appointment with count tima- scheff by jove i had forgotten all about it ex- claimed servadac then looking at his watch he cried what are you thinking of ben zoof it is scarcely two o'clock two in the morning or two in the afternoon asked ben zoof again regarding the sun servadac raised his watch to his ear it is going said he but by all the wines of medoc  amazing stories i am puzzled don't you see the sun is in the west it must be near setting setting captain why it is rising finely like a conscript at the sound of the reveille it is con- siderably higher since we have been talking incredible as it might appear the fact was un- deniable that the sun was rising over the shelif from that quarter of the horizon behind which it usually sank for the latter portion of its daily round they were utterly bewildered some mys- terious phenomenon must not only have altered the position of the sun in the sidereal system but must even have brought about an important modi- fication of the earth's rotation on her axis captain servadac consoled himself with the pros- pect of reading an explanation of the mystery in next week's newspapers and turned his attention to what was to him of more immediate importance come let us be off said he to his orderly though heaven and earth be topsy-turvy i must be at my post this morning to do count timascheff the honor of running him through the body added ben zoof if servadac and his orderly had been less pre- occupied they would have noticed that a variety of other physical changes besides the apparent altera- tion in the movement of the sun had been evolved during the atmospheric disturbances of that new year's night as they descended the steep footpath leading from the cliff towards the shelif they were conscious that their respiration became forced and rapid like that of a mountaineer when he has reached an altitude where the air has become less charged with oxygen they were also conscious that their voices were thin and feeble either they must themselves have become rather deaf or it was evident that the air had become less capable of transmitting sound the weather which on the previous evening had been very foggy had entirely changed the sky had assumed a singular tint and was soon covered with lowering clouds that completely hid the sun there were indeed all the signs of a coming storm but the vapor on account of the insufficient condensa- tion failed to fall the sea appeared quite deserted a most unusual circumstance along this coast and not a sail nor a trail of smoke broke the gray monotony of water and sky the limits of the horizon too had be- come much circumscribed on land as well as on sea the remote distance had completely disappeared and it seemed as though the globe had assumed a more decided convexity at the pace at which they were walking it was very evident that the captain and his attendant would not take long to accomplish the three miles that lay between the gourbi and the place of ren- dezvous they did not exchange a word but each was conscious of an unusual buoyancy which ap- peared to lift up their bodies and give as it were wings to their feet if ben zoof had expressed his sensations in words he would have said that he felt up to anything and he had even forgotten to taste so much as a crust of bread a lapse of memory of which the worthy soldier was rarely guilty as these thoughts were crossing his mind a harsh bark was heard to the left of the footpath and a jackal was seen emerging from a large grove of lentisks regarding the two wayfarers with manifest uneasiness the beast took up its position at the foot of a rock more than thirty feet in height it belonged to an african species dis- tinguished by a black spotted skin and a black line down the front of the legs at night-time when they scour the country in herds the crea- tures are somewhat formidable but singly they are no more dangerous than a dog though by no means afraid of them ben zoof had a particular aversion to jackals perhaps because they had no place among the fauna of his beloved montmartre he accordingly began to make threatening gestures when to the unmitigated astonishment of himself and the captain the animal darted forward and in one single bound gained the summit of the rock good heavens cried ben zoof that leap must have been thirty feet at least true enough replied the captain i never saw such a jump meantime the jackal had seated itself upon its haunches and was staring at the two men with an air of impudent defiance this was too much for ben zoof's forbearance and stooping down he caught up a huge stone when to his surprise he found that it was no heavier than a piece of petri- fied sponge confound the brute he exclaimed i might as well throw a piece of bread at him what accounts for its being as light as this nothing daunted however he hurled the stone into the air it missed its aim but the jackal deeming it on the whole prudent to decamp dis- appeared across the trees and hedges with a series of bounds which could only be likened to those that might be made by an india-rubber kangaroo ben zoof was sure that his own powers of propelling must equal those of a howitzer for his stone after a lengthened flight through the air fell to the ground full five hundred paces the other side of the rock the orderly was now some yards ahead of his master and had reached a ditch full of water and about ten feet wide with the intention of clear- ing it he made a spring when a loud cry burst from servadac ben zoof you idiot what are you about you will break your back- and well might he be alarmed for ben zoof had sprung to a height of forty feet into the air fear- ful of the consequences that would attend the des- cent of his servant to terra firma servadac bounded forwards to be on the other side of the ditch in time to break his fall but the muscular effort that he made carried him in his turn to an altitude of thirty feet in his ascent he passed ben zoof who had al- ready commenced his downward course and then obedient to the laws of gravitation he descended with increasing rapidity and alighted upon the earth without experiencing a shock greater than if he had merely made a bound of four or five feet high ben zoof burst into a roar of laughter bravo he said we should make a good pair of clowns but the captain was inclined to take a more seri- ous view of the matter for a few seconds he stood lost in thought then said solemnly ben zoof i must be dreaming pinch me hard i must be either asleep or mad it is very certain that something has happened to us said ben zoof i have occasionally dreamed off on a comet  that i was a swallow flying over the montmartre but i never experienced anything of this kind be- fore it must be peculiar to the coast of algeria servadac was stupefied he felt instinctively that he was not dreaming and yet was powerless to solve the mystery he was not however the man to puzzle himself for long over any insoluble problem come what may he presently exclaimed we will make up our minds for the future to be surprised at nothing right captain replied ben zoof and first of all let us settle our little score with count tima- scheff beyond the ditch lay a small piece of meadow land about an acre in extent a soft and delicious herb- age carpeted the soil whilst trees formed a charm- ing framework to the whole no spot could have been chosen more suitable for the meeting between the two adversaries servadac cast a hasty glance round no one was in sight we are the first on the field he said not so sure of that sir said ben zoof what do you mean asked servadac looking at his watch which he had set as nearly as possible by the sun before leaving the gourbi it is not nine o'lock yet look up there sir i am much mistaken if that is not the sun and as ben zoof spoke he pointed directly overhead to where a faint white disc was dimly visible through the haze of clouds nonsense exclaimed servadac how can the sun be in the zenith in the month of january in lat  n can't say sir i only know the sun is there and at the rate he has been traveling i would lay my cap to a dish of couscous that in less than three hours he will have set hector servadac mute and motionless stood with folded arms presently he roused himself and be- gan to look about again what means all this he murmured laws of gravity disturbed points of the compass reversed the length of day re- duced one half surely this will indefinitely post- pone my meeting with the count something has happened ben zoof and i cannot both be mad the orderly meantime surveyed his master with the greatest equanimity no phenomenon however extraordinary would have drawn from him a single exclamation of surprise do you see anyone ben zoof asked the captain at last no one sir the count has evidently been and gone but supposing that to be the case persisted the captain my seconds would have waited and not seeing me would have come on towards the gourbi i can only conclude that they have been unable to get here and as for count timascheff-- without finishing his sentence captain servadac thinking it just probable that the count as on the previous evening might come by water walked to the ridge of rock that overhung the shore in order to ascertain if the dobryna were anywhere in sight but the sea was deserted and for the first time the captain noticed that although the wind was calm the waters were unusually agitated and seethed and foamed as though they were boiling it was very certain that the yacht would have found a difficulty in holding her own in such a swell an- other thing that now struck servadac was the extra- ordinary contraction of the horizon under ordi- nary circumstances his elevated position would have allowed him a radius of vision at least five and twenty miles in length but the terrestrial sphere seemed in the course of the last few hours to have become considerably reduced in volume and he could now see for a distance of only six miles in every direction meantime with-the agility of a monkey ben zoof had clambered to the top of a eucalyptus and from his lofty perch was surveying the country to the south as well as towards both tenes and mos- taganem on descending he informed the cap- tain that the plain was deserted we will make our way to the river and get over into mostaganem said the captain the shelif was not more than a mile and a half from the meadow but no time was to be lost if the two men were to reach the town before night- fall though still hidden by heavy clouds the sun was evidently declining fast and what was equally inexplicable it was not following the oblique curve that in these latitudes and at this time of year might be expected but was sinking perpendicularly down to the horizon as he went along captain servadac pondered deeply perchance some unheard-of phenomenon had modified the rotary motion of the globe or perhaps the algerian coast had been transported beyond the equator into the southern hemisphere yet the earth with the exception of the alteration in its convexity in this part of africa at least seemed to have undergone no change of any very great importance as far as the eye could reach the shore was as it had ever been a succession of cliffs beach and arid rocks tinged with a red ferruginous hue to the south--if south in this inverted order of things it might still be called-- the face of the country also appeared unaltered and some leagues away the peaks of the merdeyah mountains still retained their accustomed outline presently a rift in the clouds gave passage to an oblique ray of light that clearly proved that the sun was setting in the east well i am curious to know what they think of all this at mostaganem said the captain i won- der too what the minister of war will say when he receives a telegram informing him that his afri- can colony has become not morally but physically disorganized that the cardinal points are at vari- ance with ordinary rules and that the sun in the -month of january is shining down vertically upon our heads ben zoof whose ideas of discipline were ex- tremely rigid at once suggested that the colony should be put under the surveillance of the police that the cardinal points should be placed under re- straint and that the sun should be shot for breach of discipline meantime they were both advancing with the utmost speed the decompression of the atmo- sphere made the specific gravity of their bodies extraordinarily light and they ran like hares and leaped like chamois leaving the devious windings of the footpath they went as a crow would fly across the country hedges trees and streams were cleared at a bound and under these conditions ben zoof felt that he could have overstepped mont- martre at a single stride the earth seemed as  amazing stories elastic as the spring-board of an acrobat they scarcely touched it with their feet and their only fear was lest the height to which they were pro- pelled would consume the time which they were saving by their short cut across the fields it was not long before their wild career brought them to the right bank of the shelif here they were compelled to stop for not only had the bridge completely disappeared but the river itself no long- er existed of the left bank there was not the slightest trace anltl the right bank which on the previous evening had bounded the yellow stream as it murmured peacefully along the fertile plain had now become the shore of a tumultuous ocean its azure waters extending westwards far as the eye could reach and annihilating the tract of country which had hitherto formed the district of mosta- ganem the shore coincided exactly with what had been the right bank of the shelif and in a slightly curved line ran north and south whilst the adjacent groves and meadows all retained their previous positions but the river-bank had become the shore of an unknown sea eager to throw some light upon the mystery servadac hurriedly made his way through the ole- ander bushes that overhung the shore took up some water in the hollow of his hand and carried it to his lips salt as brine he exclaimed as soon as he had tasted it the sea has undoubtedly swallowed up all the western part of algeria it will not last long sir said ben zoof it is probably only a severe flood the captain shook his head worse than that i fear ben zoof he replied with emotion it is a catastrophe that may have very serious conse- quences what can have become of all my friends and fellow-officers  ben zoof was silent rarely had he seen his mas- ter so much agitated and though himself inclined to receive these phenomena with philosophic in- difference his notions of military duty caused his countenance to reflect the captain's expression of amazement but there was little time for servadac to exam- ine the changes which a few hours had wrought the sun had already reached the eastern horizon and just as though it were crossing the ecliptic under the tropics it sank like a cannon ball into the sea without any warning day gave place to night and earth sea and sky were immediately wrapped in profound obscurity chapter vi the captain makes an exploration hector servadac was not the man to remain long unnerved by any untoward event it was part of his character to discover the why and the wherefore of everything that came under his observation and he would have faced a cannon ball the more un- flinchingly from understanding the dynamic force by which it was propelled such being his tem- perament it may well be imagined that he was anxious not to remain long in ignorance of the cause of the phenomena which had been so stai't- ling in their consequences we must inquire into this to-morrow he ex- claimed as darkness fell suddenly upon them then after a pause he added that is to say if there is to be a to-morrow for if i were to be put to the torture i could not tell what has become of the sun may i ask sir what we are to do now put in ben zoof stay where we are for the present and when daylight appears--if it ever does appear--we will explore the coast to the west and south and return to the gourbi if we can find out nothing else we must at least discover where we are meanwhile sir may we go to sleep certainly if you like and if you can nothing loath to avail himself of his master's permission ben zoof crouched down in an angle of the shore threw his arras over his eyes and very soon slept the sleep of the ignorant which is often sounder than the sleep of the just overwhelmed by the questions that crowded up- on his brain captain servadac could only wander up and down the shore again and again he asked himself what the catastrophe could portend had the towns of algiers oran and mostaganem es- caped the inundation could he bring himself to believe that all the inhabitants his friends and comrades had perished or was it not more prob- able that the mediterranean had merely invaded the region of the mouth of the shelif but this supposition did not in the least explain the other physical disturbances another hypothesis that presented itself to his mind was thatthe african coast might have been suddenly transported to the equatorial zone but although this might get over the difficulty of the altered altitude of the sun and the absence of twilight yet it would neither ac- count for the sun setting in the east nor for the length of the day being reduced to six hours we must wait till to-morrow he repeated add- ing for he had become distrustful of the future that is to say if to-morrow ever comes although not very learned in astronomy serva- dac was acquainted with the position of the princi- pal constellations it was therefore a considerable disappointment to him that in consequence of the heavy clouds not a star was visible in the firma- ment to have ascertained that the pole-star had become displaced would have been an undeniable proof that the earth was revolving on a new axis but not a rift appeared in the lowering clouds which seemed to threaten torrents of rain it happened that the moon was new on that very day naturally therefore it would have set at the same time as the sun what then was the cap- tain's bewilderment when after he had been walk- ing for about an hour and a half he noticed on the western horizon a strong glare that penetrated even the masses of the clouds the moon in the west he cried aloud but sud- denly bethinking himself he added but no that cannot be the moon unless she has shifted very much nearer the earth she could never give a light as intense as this as he spoke the screen of vapor was illuminated to such a degree that'the whole country was as it were bathed in twilight what can this be soliloquized the captain it cannot be the sun for the sun set in the east only an hour and a half ago would that those clouds would disclose what enor- mous luminary lies behind them what a fool i was not to have learnt more astronomy perhaps off on a comet  after all i am racking my brain over something that is quite in the ordinary course of nature but reason as he might the mysteries of the heavens still remained impenetrable for about an hour some luminous body its disc evidently of gi- gantic dimensions shed its rays upon the upper strata of the clouds then marvelous to relate in- stead of obeying the ordinary laws of celestial mechanism and descending upon the opposite hori- zon it seemed to retreat farther off grew dimmer and vanished the darkness that returned to the face of the earth was not more profound than the gloom which fell upon the captain's soul everything was in- comprehensible the simplest mechanical rules seemed falsified the planets had defied the laws of gravitation the motions of the celestial spheres were erroneous as those of a watch with a defective mainspring and there was reason to fear that the sun would never again shed his radiance upon the earth but these last fears were groundless in three hours time without any intervening twilight the morning sun made its appearance in the west and day once more had dawned on consulting his watch servadac found that night had lasted pre- cisely six hours ben zoof who was unaccustomed to so brief a period of repose was still slumbering soundly come wake up said servadac shaking him by the shoulder it is time to start time to start exclaimed ben zoof rubbing his eyes i feel as if i had only just gone to sleep you have slept all night at any rate replied the captain it has only been for six hours but you must make it enough enough it shall be sir was the submissive rejoinder and now continued servadac we will take the shortest way back to the gourbi and see what our horses think about it all they will think that they ought to be groomed said the orderly very good you may groom them and saddle them as quickly as you like i want to know what has become of the rest of algeria if we cannot get round by the south to mostaganem we must go eastwards to tenes and forthwith they started beginning to feel hungry they had no hesitation in gathering figs dates and oranges from the plan- tations that formed a continuous rich and luxuriant orchard along their path the district was quite deserted and they had no reason to fear any legal penalty in an hour and a half they reached the gourbi everything was jut as they had left it and it was evident that no one had visited the place during their absence all was desolate as the shore they had quitted the preparations for the expedition were brief and simple ben zoof saddled the horses and filled his pouch with biscuits and game water he felt certain could be obtained in abundance from the numerous affluents of the shelif which although they had now become tributaries of the mediter- ranean still meandered through the plain captain servadac mounted his horse zephyr and ben zoof simultaneously got astride his mare galette named after the mill of montmartre they galloped off in the direction of the shelif and were not long in discovering that the diminution in the pressure of the atmosphere had precisely the same effect upon their horses as it had had upon themselves their muscular strength seemed five times as great as hitherto their hoofs scarcely touched the ground and they seemed transformed from ordinary quad- rupeds into veritable hippogriffs happily serva- dac and his orderly were fearless riders they made no attempt to curb their steeds but even urged them to still greater exertions twenty minutes sufficed to carry them over the four or five miles that inter- vened between the gourbi and the mouth of the shelif then slackening their speed they proceeded at a more leisurely pace to the southeast along what had once been the right bank of the river but which although it still retained its former char- acteristics was now the boundary of a sea which extending farther than the limits of the horizon must have swallowed up at least a large portion of the province of oran captain servadac knew the country well he had at one time been engaged upon a trigonometrical survey of the district and conse- quently had an accurate knowledge of its topo- graphy his idea now was to draw up a report of his investigations to whom that report should be delivered was a problem he had yet to solve during the four hours of daylight that still re- mained the travelers rode about twenty-one miles from the river mouth to their vast surprise they did not meet a single human being at nightfall they again encamped in a slight bend of the shore at a point which on the pi'evious evening had faced the mouth of the mina one of the left-hand affluents of the shelif but now absorbed into the newly re- vealed ocean ben zoof made the sleeping accommo- dation as comfortable as the circumstances would allow the horses were hobbled and turned out to feed upon the rich pasture that clothed the shore and the night passed without special incident at sunrise on the following morning the nd of january or what according to the ordinary calen- dar would have been the night of the st the cap- tain and his orderly remounted their horses and during the six-hours day accomplished a distance of forty-two miles the right bank of the river still continued to be the margin of the land and only in one spot had its integrity been impaired this was about twelve miles from the mina and on the site of the annex or suburb of surkelmittoo here a large portion of the bank had been swept away and the hamlet with its eight hundred in- habitants had no doubt been swallowed up by the encroaching waters it seemed therefore more than probable that a similar fate had overtaken the larger towns beyond the shelif in the evening the explorers encamped as pre- viously in a nook of the shore which here abruptly terminated their new domain not far from where they might have expected to find the important vil- lage of memounturroy but of this too there was now no trace i had quite reckoned upon a supper and a bed at orleansville to-night said servadac as full of despondency he surveyed the waste of water quite impossible replied ben zoof except you had gone by a boat but cheer up sir cheer up we will soon devise some means for getting across to mostaganem  amazing stories if as i hope rejoined the captain we are on a peninsula we are more likely to get to tenes there we shall hear the news far more likely to carry the news ourselves answered ben zoof as he threw himself down for his night's rest six hours later only waiting for sunrise captain servadac set himself in movement again to renew his investigations at this spot the shore that hitherto had been running in a southeasterly direc- tion turned abruptly to the north being no longer formed by the natural bank of the shelif but con- sisting of an absolutely new coast-line no land was in sight nothing could be seen of orleans- ville which ought to have been about six miles to the southwest and ben zoof who had mounted the highest point of view attainable could distinguish sea and nothing but sea to the farthest horizon quitting their encampment and riding on the bewildered explorers kept close to the new shore this since it had ceased to be formed by the origi- nal river bank had considerably altered its aspect frequent landslips occurred and in many places deep chasms rifted the ground great gaps furrowed the fields and trees half uprooted overhung the water remarkable by the fantastic distortions of their gnarled trunks looking as though they had been chopped by a hatchet the sinuosities of the coast line alternately gully and headland had the effect of making a devious progress for the travelers and at sunset although they had accomplished more than twenty miles they had only just arrived at the foot of the mer- deyah mountains which before the cataclysm had formed the extremity of the chain of the little atlas the ridge however had been violently rup- tured and now rose nerpendicularly from the water on the following morning sei'vadac and ben zoof traversed one of the mountain gorges and next in order to make a more thorough acquaintance with the limits and condition of the section of algerian territory of which they seemed to be left as the sole occupants they dismounted and proceeded on foot to the summit of one of the highest peaks from this elevation they ascertained that from the base of the merdeyah to the mediterranean a distance of about eighteen miles a new coast line had come into existence no land was visible in any direction no isthmus existed to form a connecting link with the territory of tenes which had entirely dis- appeared the result was that captain servadac was driven to the irresistible conclusion that the tract of land which he had been surveying was not as he had at first imagined a peninsula it was actually an island strictly generally speaking this island was quad- rilateral but the sides were so irregular that it was much more nearly a triangle the comparison of the sides exhibiting these proportions the section of the right bank of the shelif seventy-two miles the southern boundary from the shelif to the chain of the little atlas twenty-one miles from the little atlas to the mediterranean eighteen miles and sixty miles of the shore of the mediterranean itself making in all an entire circumference of about  miles what does it all mean exclaimed the captain every hour growing more and more bewildered the will of providence and we must submit replied ben zoof calm and undisturbed with this reflection the two men silently descended the mountain and remounted their horses before eve- ning they had reached the mediterranean on their road they failed to discern a vestige of the little town of montenotte like tenes of which not so much as a ruined cottage was visible on the horizon it seemed to be annihilated on the following day the th of january the two men made a forced march along the coast of the mediterranean which they found less altered than the captain had at first supposed but four villages had entirely disappeared and the head- lands unable to resist the shock of the convulsion had been detached from the mainland the circuit of the island had been now completed and the explorers after a period of sixty hours found themselves once more beside the ruins of their gourbi five days or what according to the established order of things would have been two days and a half had been occupied in tracing the boundaries of their new domain and they had as- certained beyond a doubt that they were the sole human inhabitants left upon the island well sir here you are governor general of algeria exclaimed ben zoof as they reached the gourbi with not a soul to govern gloomily rejoined the captain how so do you not reckon me pshaw ben zoof what are you what am i why i am the population the captain deigned no reply but muttering some expressions of regret for the fruitless trouble he had taken about his rondo betook himself to rest chapter vii ben zoof watches in vain in a few minutes the governor general and his population were asleep the gourbi being in ruins they were obliged to put up with the best accommo- dation they could find in the adjacent erection it must be owned that the captain's slumbers were by no means sound he was agitated by the conscious- ness that he had hitherto been unable to account for his strange experiences by any reasonable theory though far from being advanced in the knowledge of natural philosophy he had been in- structed to a certain degree in its elementary principles and by an effort of memory he man- aged to recall some general laws which he had al- most forgotten he could understand that an al- tered inclination of the earth's axis with regard to the ecliptic would introduce a change of position in the cardinal points and bring about a displace- ment of the sea but the hypothesis entirely failed to account either for the shortening of the days or for the diminution in the pressure of the atmos- phere he felt that his judgment was utterly baffled his only remaining hope was that the chain of marvels was not yet complete and that some- thing farther might throw some light upon the mystery ben zoof's first care on the following morning was to provide a good breakfast to use his own phrase he was as hungry as the whole population of three million algerians of whom he was the off on a comet  representative and he must have enough to eat the catastrophe which had overwhelmed the coun- try had left a dozen eggs uninjured and upon these with a good dish of his famous couscous he hoped that he and his master might have a sufficiently substantial meal the stove was ready for use the copper skillet was as bright as hands could make it and the beads of condensed steam upon the sur- face of a large stone alcarraza gave evidence that it was supplied with water ben zoof at once lighted a fire singing all the time according to his wont a snatch of an old military refrain ever on the lookout for fresh phenomena cap- tain servadac watched the preparations with a curi- ous eye it struck him that perhaps the air in its strangely modified condition would fail to supply sufficient oxygen and that the stove in consequence might not fulfill its function but no the fire was lighted just as usual and fanned into vigor by ben zoof applying his mouth in lieu of bellows and a bright flame started up from the midst of the twigs and coal the skillet was duly set upon the stove and ben zoof was prepared to wait awhile for the water to boil taking up the eggs he was surprised to notice that they hardly weighed more than they would if they had been mere shells but he was still more surprised when he saw that before the water had been two minutes over the fii'e it was at full boil by jingo he exclaimed a precious hot fire servadac reflected it cannot be that the fire is hotter he said the peculiarity must be in the water and taking down a centigrade thermometer which hung upon the wall he plunged it into the skillet instead of  the instrument registered only  take my advice ben zoof he said leave your eggs in the saucepan a good quarter of an hour boil them hard that will never do objected the orderly you will not find them hard my good fellow trust me we shall be able to dip our sippets into the yolks easily enough the captain was quite right in his conjecture that this new phenomenon was caused by a diminution in the pressure of the atmosphere water boiling at a temperature of  was itself an evidence that the ocean of air above the earth's surface had been reduced by one-third of its quantity the identical phenomenon would have occurred at the summit of a mountain  feet high and had servadac been in possession of a barometer he would have immediately discovered the fact that only now for the first time as the result of experi- ment revealed itself to him--a fact moreover which accounted for the effect upon the blood- vessels which both he and ben zoof had experienced as well as for the attenuation of their voices and their accelerated breathing and yet he agreed with himself if our encampment has been pro- jected to so great an elevation how is it that the sea remains at its proper level once again hector servadac though capable of tracing consequences felt himself totally at a loss to comprehend their cause hence his agitation and bewilderment after their prolonged immersion in the boiling water the eggs were found to be only just suffi- ciently cooked the couscous was very much in the same condition and ben zoof came to the conclu- sion that in future he must be careful to commence his culinary operations an hour earlier he was rejoiced at last to help his master who in spite of his perplexed preoccupation seemed to have a very fair appetite for breakfast well captain said ben zoof presently such being his ordinary way of opening conversation well ben zoof was the captain's invariable response to his servant's formula what are we to do now sir we can only for the present wait patiently where we are we are encamped upon an island and therefore we can only be rescued by sea but do you suppose that any of our friends are still alive asked ben zoof oh i think we must indulge the hope that this catastrophe has not extended far we must trust that it has limited its mischief to some small por- tion of the algerian coast and that our friends are all alive and well no doubt the governor general will be anxious to investigate the full extent of the damage and will send a vessel from algiers to explore it is not likely that we shall be forgotten what you have to do then ben zoof is to keep a sharp lookout and to be ready in case a vessel should appear to make signals at once but if no vessel should appear sighed the orderly then we must build a boat and go in search of those who do not come in search of us very good but what sort of a sailor are you everyone can be a sailor when he must said servadac calmly ben zoof said no more for several succeeding days he scanned the horizon unintermittently with his telescope his watching was in vain no ship appeared upon the desert sea by the name of a kabyle he broke out impatiently his excellency is grossly neglige it although the days and nights had become reduced from twenty-four hours to twelve captain serva- dac would not accept the new condition of things but resolved to adhere to the computations of the old calendar notwithstanding therefore that the sun had risen and set twelve times since the com- mencement of the new year he persisted in calling the following day the th of january his watch enabled him to keep an accurate account of the passing hours in the course of his life ben zoof had read a few books after pondering one day he said it seems to me captain that you have turned into robinson crusoe and that i am your man friday i hope i have not become a negro no replied the captain your complexion isn't the fairest in the world but you are not black yet well i had much sooner be a white friday than a black one rejoined ben zoof still no ship appeared and captain servadac after the example of all previous crusoes began to consider it advisable to investigate the resources of his domain the new territory of which he had become the monarch he named gourbi island it had a superficial area of about nine hundred square miles bullocks cows goats and sheep existed in considerable numbers and as there seemed already to be an abundance of game it was hardly likely  amazing stories that a future supply would fail them the condition of the cereals was such as to promise a fine ingath- ering of wheat maize and rice so that for the governor and his population with their two horses not only was there ample provision but even if other human inhabitants besides themselves should yet be discovered there was not the remotest pros- pect of any of them perishing by starvation from the th to the th of january the rain came down in torrents and what was quite an unusual occurrence at this season of the year sev- eral heavy storms broke over the island in spite however of the continual downfall the heavens still remained veiled in cloud servadac moreover did not fail to observe that for the season the tempera- ture was unusually high and as a matter still more surprising that it kept steadily increasing as though the earth were gradually and continuously approximating to the sun in proportion to the rise of temperature the light also assumed greater intensity and if it had not been for the screen of vapor interposed between the sky and the island the irradiation which would have illumined all ter- restrial objects would have been vivid beyond all precedent but neither sun moon nor star ever appeared and servadac's irritation and annoyance at being unable to identify any one point of the firmament may be more readily imagined than described on one occasion ben zoof endeavored to mitigate his master's impatience by exhorting him to assume the resignation even if he did not feel the indif- ference which he himself experienced but his advice was received with so angry a rebuff that he retired in all haste abashed to resume his watch- man's duty which he performed with exemplary perseverance day and night with the shortest possible intervals of rest despite wind rain and storm he mounted guard upon the cliff--but all in vain not a speck appeared upon the desolate horizon to say the truth no vessel could have stood against the weather the hurricane raged with tremendous fury and the waves rose to a height that seemed to defy calculation never even in the second era of creation when under the influ- ence of internal heat the waters rose in vapor to descend in deluge back upon the world could mete- orological phenomena have been developed with more impressive intensity but by the night of the th the tempest appeared to have spent its fury the wind dropped the rain ccased as if by a spell and servadac who for the last six days had confined himself to the shelter of his roof hastened to join ben zoof at his post upon the cliff now he thought there might be a chance of solving his perplexity perhaps now the huge disc of which he had an imperfect glimpse on the night of the st of december might again reveal itself at any rate he hoped for an oppor- tunity of observing the constellations in a clear firmament above the night was magnificent not a cloud dimmed the luster of the stars which spangled the heavens in surpassing brilliancy and several nebulse which hitherto no astronomer had been able to discern without the aid of a telescope were clearly visible to the naked eye by a natural impulse servadac's first thought was to observe the position of the pole-star it was in sight but so near to the horizon as to suggest the utter impossibility of its being any longer the central pivot of the sidereal system it occupied a position through which it was out of the question that the axis of the earth indefinitely prolonged could ever pass in his impression he was more thoroughly confirmed when an hour later he no- ticed that the star had approached still nearer the horizon as though it had belonged to one of the zodiacal constellations the pole-star being manifestly thus displaced it remained to be discovered whether any other of the celestial bodies had become a fixed center around which the constellations made their apparent daily revolutions to the solution of this problem ser- vadac applied himself with the most thoughtful diligence after patient observation he satisfied himself that the required conditions were answered by a certain star that was stationary not far from the horizon this was vega in the constellation lyra a star which according to the precession of the equinoxes will take the place of our pole-star  years hence the most daring imagination could not suppose that a period of  years had been crowded into the space of a fortnight and therefore the captain came as to an easier conclu- sion to the opinion that the earth's axis had been suddenly and immensely shifted and from the fact that the axis if produced would pass through a point so litle removed above the horizon he deduced the inference that the mediterranean must have been transported to the equator lost in bewildering maze of thought he gazed long and intently upon the heavens his eyes wan- dered from where the tail of the great bear now a zodiacal constellation was scarcely visible above the waters to where the stars of the southern hemi sphere were just breaking on his view a cry from ben zoof recalled him to himself the moon shouted the orderly as though over joyed at once again beholding what the poet has called the kind companion of terrestrial night and he pointed to a disc that was rising at a spot precisely opposite the place where they would have expected to see the sun the moon again he cried but captain servadac could not altogether enter into his servant's enthusiasm if this were actually the moon her distance from the earth must have been increased by some millions of miles he was rather disposed to suspect that it was not the earth's satellite at all but some planet with its apparent magnitude greatly enlarged by its approximation to the earth taking up the powerful field-glass which he was accustomed to use in his surveying operations he proceeded to investigate more care- fully the luminous orb but he failed to trace any of the lineaments supposed to resemble a human face that mark the lunar surface he failed to decipher any indications of hill and plain nor could he make out the aureole of light which emanates from what astronomers have designated mount tycho it is not the moon he said slowly not the moon cried ben zoof why not it is not the moon again affirmed the captain why not repeated ben zoof unwilling to re- nounce his first impression off on a comet  because there is a small satellite in attendance and the captain drew his servant's attention to a bright speck apparently about the size of one of jupiter's satellites seen through a moderate tele- scope that was clearly visible just within the focus of his glass here then was a fresh mystery the orbit of this planet was assuredly interior to the orbit of the earth because it accompanied the sun in its apparent motion yet it was neither mercury nor venus because neither one nor the other of these has any satellite at all the captain stamped and stamped again with mingled vexation agitation and bewilderment confound it he cried if this is neither venus nor mercury it must be the moon but if it is the moon whence in the name of all the gods has she picked up another moon for herself the captain was in dire perplexity chapter viii venus in perilous proximity the light of the returning sun soon extinguished the glory of the stars and rendered it necessary for the captain to postpone his observations he had sought in vain for further trace of the huge disc that had so excited his wonder on the first and it seemed most probable that in its irregular orbit it had been carried beyond the range of vision the weather was still superb the wind after veering to the west had sunk to a perfect calm pursuing its inverted course the sun rose and set with undeviating regularity and the days and nights were still divided into periods of precisely six hours each--a sure proof that the sun remained close to the new equator which manifestly passed through gourbi island meanwhile the temperature was steadily increas- ing the captain kept his thermometers close at hand where he could repeatedly consult it and on the th he found that it registered  centigrade in the shade no attempt had been made to rebuild the gourbi but the captain and ben zoof managed to make up quarters sufficiently comfortable in the principal apartment of the adjoining structure where the stone walls that at first afforded a refuge from the torrents of rain now formed an equally accept- able shelter from the burning sun the heat was becoming insufferable surpassing the heat of sen- egal and other equatorial regions not a cloud ever tempered the intensity of the solar rays and unless some modification ensued it seemed inevitable that all vegetation should become scorched and burnt off from the face of the island in spite however of the profuse perspirations from which he suffered ben zoof constant to his principles expressed no surprise at the unwonted heat no remonstrances from his master could induce him to abandon his watch from the cliff to withstand the vertical beams of that noontide sun would seem to require a skull of brass and a brain of adamant but yet hour after hour he would remain conscientiously scanning the surface of the mediterranean which calm and deserted lay out- stretched before him on one occasion servadac in reference to his orderly's indomitable persever- ance happened to remark that he thought he must have been born in the heart of equatorial africa to which ben zoof replied with the utmost dignity that he was born at montmartre which was all the same the worthy fellow was unwilling to own that even in the matter of heat the tropics could in any way surpass his own much-loved home this unprecedented temperature very soon began to take effect upon the products of the soil the sap rose rapidly in the trees so that in the course of a few days buds leaves flowers and fruit had come to full maturity it was the same with the cereals wheat and maize sprouted and ripened as if by magic and for a while a rank and luxuriant pasturage clothed the meadows summer and autumn seemed blended into one if captain ser- vadac had been more deeply versed in astronomy he would perhaps have been able to bring to bear his knowledge that if the axis of the earth as every- thing seemed to indicate now formed a right angle with the plane of the ecliptic her various seasons like those of the planet jupiter would become limi- ted to certain zones in which they would remain invariable but even if he had understood the rationale of the change the convulsion that had brought it about would have been as much a mys- tery as ever the precocity of vegetation caused some embar- rassment the time for the corn and fruit harvest had fallen simultaneously with that of the hay mak- ing and as the extreme heat precluded any pro- longed exertions it was evident the population of the island would find it difficult to provide the necessary amount of labor not that the prospect gave them much concern the provisions of the gourbi were still far from exhausted and now that the roughness of the weather had so happily sub- sided they had every encouragement to hope that a ship of some sort would soon appear not only was that part of the mediterranean systematically frequented by the government steamers that watched the coast but vessels of all nations were constantly cruising off the shore in spite however of all their sanguine specula- tions no ship appeared ben zoof admitted the necessity of extemporizing a kind of parasol for himself otherwise he must literally have been roasted to death upon the exposed summit of the cliff meanwhile servadac was doing his utmost--it must be acknowledged with indifferent success-- to recall the lessons of his school-days he would plunge into the wildest speculations in his endeavors to unravel the difficulties of the new situation and struggled into a kind of conviction that if there had been a change of manner in the earth's rotation on her axis there would be a corresponding change in her revolution round the sun which would involve the consequence of the length of the year being either diminished or increased independently of the increased and increasing heat there was another very conclusive demonstra- tion that the earth had thus suddenly approached nearer to the sun the diameter of the solar disc was now exactly twice what it ordinarily looks to the naked eye in fact it was precisely such as it would appear to an observer on the surface of the planet venus the most obvious inference would therefore be that the earth's distance from the sun had been diminished from  to   amazing stories miles if the just equilibrium of the earth had thus been destroyed and should this diminution of distance still continue would there not be reason to fear that the terrestrial world would be carried onwards to actual contact with the sun which must result in its total annihilation the continuance of the splendid weather afforded servadac every facility for observing the heavens night after night constellations in their beauty lay stretched before his eyes--an alphabet which to his mortification not to say his rage he was unable to decipher in the apparent dimensions of the fixed stars in their distance in their relative posi- tion with regard to each other he could observe no change although it is established that our sun is approaching the constellation of hercules at the rate of more than  miles a year and although arcturus is traveling through space at the rate of fifty-four miles a second--three time faster than the earth goes round the sun--yet such is the remoteness of those stars that no appreciable change is evident to the senses the fixed stars taught him nothing far otherwise was it with the planets the orbits of venus and mercury are within the orbit of the earth venus rotating at an average distance of  miles from the sun and mercury at that of  after pondering long and as profoundly as he could upon these figures captain servadac came to the conclusion that as the earth was now receiving about double the amount of light and heat that it had been receiving before the catas- trophe it was receiving about the same as the planet venus he was driven therefore to the estimate of the measure in which the earth must have approxi- mated to the sun a deduction in which he was con- firmed when the opportunity came for him to ob- serve venus herself in the splendid proportions that she now assumed that magnificent planet which--as phosphorus or lucifer hesperus or vesper the evening star the morning star or the shepherd's star--has never failed to attract the rapturous admiration of the most indifferent observers here revealed herself with unprecedented glory exhibiting all the phases of a lustrous moon in miniature various indenta- tions in the outline of its crescent showed that the solar beams were refracted into regions of its sur- face where the sun had already set and proved beyond a doubt that the planet had an atmosphere of her own and certain luminous points projecting from the crescent as plainly marked the existence of mountains as the result of servadac's computa- tions he formed the opinion that venus could hardly be at a greater distance than  miles from the earth and a very safe distance too said ben zoof when his master told him the conclusion at which he had arrived all very well for two armies but for a couple of planets not quite so safe perhaps as you may imagine it is my impression that it is more than likely we may run foul of venus said the captain plenty of air and water there sir inquired the orderly yes as far as i can tell plenty replied ser- vadac then why shouldn't we go and visit venus servadac did his best to explain that as the two planets were of about equal volume and were travel- ing with great velocity in opposite directions any collision between them must be attended with the most disastrous consequences to one or both of them but ben zoof failed to see that even at the worst the catastrophe could be much more serious than the collision of two railway trains the captain became exasperated you idiot he angrily exclaimed cannot you understand that the planets are traveling a thousand times faster than the fastest express and that if they meet either one or the other must be destroyed what would become of your darling montmartre then the captain had touched a tender chord for a moment ben zoof stood with clenched teeth and contracted muscles then in a voice of real concern he inquired whether anything could be done to avert the calamity nothing whatever so you may go about your own business was the captain's brusque rejoinder all discomfited and bewildered ben zoof retired without a word during the ensuing days the distance between the two planets continued to decrease and it be- came more and more obvious that the earth on her new orbit was about to cross the orbit of venus throughout this time the earth had been making a perceptible approach towards mercury and that planet--which is rarely visible to the naked eye and then only at what are termed the periods of its greatest eastern and western elongations--now ap- peared in all its splendor it amply justified the epithet of sparkling which the ancients were ac- customed to confer upon it and could scarcely fail to awaken a new interest the periodic recurrence of its phases its reflection of the sun's rays shed- ding upon it a light and a heat seven times greater than that received by the earth its glacial and its torrid zones which on account of the great inclination of the axis are scarcely separable its equatorial bands its mountains eleven miles high --were all subjects of observation worthy of the most studious regard but no danger was to be apprehended from mer- cury with venus only did collision appear im- minent by the th of january the distance be- tween that planet and the earth had become reduced to between two and three millions of miles and the intensity of its light cast heavy shadows from all terrestrial objects it might be observed to turn upon its own axis in twenty-three hours twenty-one minutes--an evidence from th unaltered duration of its days that the planet had not shared in the disturbance on its disc the clouds formed from its atmospheric vapor were plainly perceptible as also were the seven spots which according to bian- chini are a chain of seas it was now visible in broad daylight bonaparte when under the direc- tory once had his attention called to venus at noon and immediately hailed it joyfully recognizing it as his own peculiar star in the ascendant captain servadac it may well be imagined did not experi- ence the same gratifying emotion on the th the distance between the two bodies had again sensibly diminished the captain had ceased to be surprised that no vessel had been sent to rescue himself and his companion from their strange imprisonment the governor general and the minister of war were doubtless far differently off on a comet  occupied and their interests far otherwise en- grossed what sensational articles he thought must now be teeming to the newspapers what crowds must be flocking to the churches the end of the world approaching the great climax close at hand two days more and the earth shivered into a myriad atoms would be lost in boundless space these dire forebodings however were not des- tined to be realized gradually the distance between the two planets began to increase the planes of their orbits did not coincide and accordingly the dreaded catastrophe did not ensue by the th venus was sufficiently remote to preclude any fur- ther fear of collision ben zoof gave a sigh of relief when the captain communicated the glad in- telligence their proximity to venus had been close enough to demonstrate that beyond a doubt that planet has no moon or satellite such as cassini short mon- taigne of limoges montbarron and some other astronomers have imagined to exist had there been such a satellite said servadac we might have captured it in passing but what can be the meaning he added seriously of all this displace- ment of the heavenly bodies what is that great building at paris captain with a top like a cap asked ben zoof do you mean the observatory yes the observatory are there not people liv- ing in the observatory who could explain all this very likely but what of that let us be philosophers and wait patiently until we can hear their explanation servadac smiled do you know what it is to be a philosopher ben zoof he asked i am a soldier sir was the servant's prompt re- joinder and i have learnt to know that what can't be cured must be endured  the captain made no reply but for a time at least he desisted from puzzling himself over mat- ters which he felt he was utterly incompetent to explain but an event soon afterwards occurred which awakened his keenest interest about nine o'clock on the morning of the th ben zoof walked deliberately into his master's apartment and in reply to a question as to what he wanted announced with the utmost composure that a ship was in sight a ship exclaimed servadac starting to his feet a ship ben zoof you donkey you speak as unconcernedly as though you were telling me that my dinner was ready are we not philosophers captain said the orderly but the captain was out of hearing chapter ix inquiries unsatisfied fast as his legs could carry him servadac had made his way to the top of the cl iff it was quite true that a vessel was in sight hardly more than six miles from the shore but owing to the increase in the earth's convexity and the consequent limita- tion of the range of vision the rigging of the top- masts alone was visible above the water this was enough however to indicate that the ship was a schooner--an impression that was confirmed when two hours later she came entirely in sight the dobryna exclaimed servadac keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope impossible sir rejoined ben zoof there are no signs of smoke the dobryna repeated the captain positively she is under sail but she is count timaschef's yacht he was right if the count were on board a strange fatality was bringing him to the presence of his rival but no longer now could servadac regard him in the light of an adversary circum- stances had changed and all animosity was ab- sorbed in the eagerness with which he hailed the prospect of obtaining some information about the recent startling and inexplicable events during the twenty-seven days that she had been absent the dobryna he conjectured would have explored the mediterranean  would very probably have visited spain   france  or  italy  and accordingly would con- vey to  gourbi island  some intelligence from one or other of those countries he reckoned therefore not only upon ascertaining the extent of the late catastrophe but upon learning its cause count timascheff was no doubt magnanimously coming to the rescue of himself and his orderly the wind being adverse the dobryna did not make very rapid progress but as the weather in spite of a few clouds remained calm and the sea was quite smooth she was enabled to hold a steady coursc it seemed unaccountable that she should not use her engine as whoever was on board would be naturally impatient to reconnoiter the new island which must just have come within their view the probability that suggested itself was that the schooner's fuel was exhausted servadac took it for granted that the dobryna was endeavoring to put in it occurrecho him how- ever that the count on discovering an island where he had expected to find the mainland of africa would not unlikely be at a loss for a place of an- chorage the yacht was evidently making her way in the direction of the former mouth of the shelif and the captain was struck with the idea that he would do well to investigate whether there was any suitable harbor towards which he might signal her zephyr and gallette were soon saddled and in twenty minutes had carried their riders to the western extremity of the island where they both dismounted and began to explore the coast they were not long in ascertaining that on the farther side of the point there was a small well- sheltered creek of sufficient depth to accommodate a vessel of moderate tonnage a narrow channel formed a passage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea and which even in the roughest weather would ensure the calmness of its waters whilst examining the rocky shore the captain observed to his great surprise long and well-de- fined rows of seaweed which undoubtedly betokened that there had been a very considerable ebb and flow of the waters--a thing unknown in the medi- terranean where there is scarcely any perceptible tide what however seemed most remarkable was the manifest evidence that ever since the highest flood which was caused in all probability by the proximity of the body of which the huge disc had been so conspicuous on the night of the st of de- cember the phenomenon had been gradually lessen-  amazing stories ing and in fact was now reduced to the normal limits which had characterized it before the con- vulsion without doing more than note the circumstance servadac turned his entire attention to the dob- ryna which now little more than a mile from shore could not fail to see and understand his signals slightly changing her course she first lowered her mainsail and in order to facilitate the movements of her helmsman soon carried nothing but her two topsails brigantine and jib after rounding the peak she steered direct for the channel to which servadac by his gestures was pointing her and was not long in entering the creek as soon as the anchor imbedded in the sandy bottom had made good its hold a boat was lowered in a few minutes more count timascheff had landed on the island captain servadac hastened towards him first of all count he exclaimed impetuously before we speak one other word tell me what has happened the count whose imperturbable composure pre- sented a singular contrast to the french officer's enthusiastic vivacity made a stiff bow and in his russian accent replied first of all permit me to express my surprise at seeing you here i left you on a continent and here i have the honor of finding you on an island i assure you count i have never left the place i am quite aware of it captain servadac and i now beg to offer you my sincere apologies for failing to keep my appointment with you never mind now interposed the captain we will talk of that by-and-by first tell me what has happened the very question i was about to put to you captain servadac do you mean to say you know nothing of the cause and can tell me nothing of the extent of the catastrophe which has transformed this part of africa into an island nothing more than you know yourself but surely count timascheff you can inform me whether upon the northern shore of the medi- terranean- are you certain that this is the mediterranean asked the count significantly and added i have discovered no sign of land the captain stared in silent bewilderment for some moments he seemed perfectly stupefied then recovering himself he began to overwhelm the count with a torrent of questions had he noticed ever since the st of january that the sun had rfsen in the west had he noticed that the days had been only six hours long and that the weight of the atmosphere was so much diminished had he ob- served that the moon had quite disappeared and that the earth had been in imminent hazard of run- ning foul of the planet venus was he aware in short that the entire motions of the terrestrial sphere had undergone a complete modification to all these inquiries the count responded in the affirm- ative he was acquainted with everything that had transpired but to servadac's increasing astonish- ment he could throw no light upon the cause of any of the phenomena on the night of the st of december he said i was proceeding by sea to our appointed place of meeting when my yacht was suddenly caught on the crest of an enormous wave and carried to a height which it is beyond my power to estimate some mysterious force seemed to have brought about a convulsion of the elements our engine was damaged nay disabled and we drifted entirely at the mercy of the terrible hurricane that raged during the succeeding days that the dobryna escaped at all is little less than a miracle and i can only attribute her safety to the fact that she oc- cupied the center of the vast cyclone and conse- quently did not experience much change of posi- tion he paused and added your island is the first land we have seen then let us put out to sea at once and ascer- tain the extent of the disaster cried the captain eagerly you will take me on board count will you not my yacht is at your service sir even should you require to make a tour round the world a tour round the mediterranean will suffice for the present i think said the captain smiling the count shook his head i am not sure said he but what the tour of the mediterranean will prove to be the tour of the world servadac made no reply but for a time remained silent and absorbed in thought after the silence was broken they consulted as to what course was best to pursue and the plan they proposed was in the first place to discover how much of the african coast still remained and to carry on the tidings of their own experiences to  algiers  or in the event of the southern shore having actually disappeared they would make their way northwards and put themselves in communica- tion with the population on the southern shores of europe before starting it was indispensable that the engine of the dobryna should be repaired to sail under canvas only would in contrary winds and rough seas be both tedious and difficult the stock of coal on board was adequate for two months con- sumption but as it would at the expiration of that time be exhausted it was obviously the part of pru- dence to employ it in reaching a port where fuel could be replenished the damage sustained by the engine proved to be not very serious and in three days after her arrival the dobryna was again ready to put to sea servadac employed the interval in making the count acquainted with all he knew about his small domain they made an entire circuit of the island and both agreed that it must be beyond the limits of that circumscribed territory that they must seek an explanation of what had so strangely transpired it was on the last day of january that the repairs of the schooner were completed a slight diminu- tion in the excessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only ap- parent change in the general order of things but whether this was to be attributed to any alteration in the earth's orbit was a question which would still require several days to decide the weather re- mained fine and although a few clouds had accumu- lated and might have caused a trifling fall of the barometer they were not sufficiently threatening to delay the departure of the dobryna doubts now arose and some discussion followed off on a comet  whether or not it was desirable for ben zoof to accompany his master there were various reasons why he should be left behind not the least im- portant being that the schooner had no accommoda- tion for horses and the orderly would have found it hard to part with zephyr and much more with his own favorite galette besides it was advisable that there should be some one left to receive any stisingers that might possibly arrive as well as to keep an eye upon the herds of cattle which in the dubious prospect before them might prove to be the sole resource of the survivors of the catas- trophe altogether taking into consideration that the grave fellow would incur no personal risk by remaining upon the island the captain was induced with much reluctance to forego the attendance of his servant hoping very shortly to return and to restore him to his country when he had ascertained the solution of the mysteries in which they were enveloped on the st then ben zoof was invested with governor's powers and took an affecting leave of his master begging him if chance should carry him near montmartre to ascertain whether the be- loved mountain had been left unmoved farewells over the dobryna was carefully steered through the creek and was soon upon the open seas chapter x a search for algeria the dobryna a strong craft of  tons burden had been built in the famous shipbuilding yards of the isle of wight her sea-going qualities were excellent and would have amply sufficed for a cir- cumnavigation of the globe count timascheff was himself no sailor but had the greatest confidence in leaving the command of his yacht in the hands of lieutenant procope a man of about thirty years of age and an excellent seaman born on the count's estates the son of a serf who had been emancipated long before the famous edict of the emperor alexander procope was sincerely attached by a tie of gratitude as well as of duty and affection to his patron's service after an apprenticeship on a merchant ship he had entered the imperial navy and had already reached the rank of lieutenant when the count appointed him to the charge of his own private yacht in which he was accustomed to spend by far the greater part of his time throughout the winter generally cruis- ing in the mediterranean whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters the ship could not have been in better hands the lieutenant was well informed in many matters out- side the pale of his profession and his attainments were alike creditable to himself and to the liberal friend who had given him his education he had an excellent crew consisting of tiglew the engineer four sailors named niegoch tolstoy etkef and ponafka and mochel the cook these men without exception were all sons of the count's tenants and so tenaciously even out at sea did they cling to their old traditions that it mattered little to them what physical disorganization ensued so long as they felt they were sharing the experiences of their lord and master the late astounding events how- ever had rendered procope manifestly uneasy and not the less so from his consciousness that the count secretly partook of his own anxiety steam up and canvas spread the schooner started eastward with a favorable wind she would cer- tainly have made eleven knots an hour had not the high waves somewhat impeded her progress al- though only a moderate breeze was blowing the sea was rough a circumstance to be accounted for only by the diminution in the force of the earth's attrac- tion rendering the liquid particles so buoyant that by the mere effect of oscillation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented m arago has fixed twenty-five or twenty-six feet as the maxi- mum elevation ever attained by the highest waves and his astonishment would have been very great to see them rising fifty or even sixty feet nor did these waves in the usual way partially unfurl them- selves and rebound against the sides of the vessel they might rather be described as long undulations carrying the schooner its weight diminished from the same cause as that of the water alternately to such heights and depths that if captain ser- vadac had been subject to seasickness he must have found himself in sorry plight as the pitching however was the result of a long uniform swell the yacht did not labor much harder than she would against the ordinary short strong waves of the mediterranean the main inconvenience that was experienced was the diminution in her proper rate of speed for a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by the coast of algeria but no land appeared to the south the changed posi- tions of the planets rendered them of no avail for purposes of nautical observation nor could lieu- tenant procope calculate his latitude and longitude by the altitude of the sun as his reckonings would be useless when applied to charts that had been constructed for the old order of things but never- theless by means of the log which gave him the rate of progress and by the compass which indi- cated the direction in which they were sailing he was able to form an estimate of his position that was sufficiently free from error for his immediate need happily the recent phenomena had no effect upon the compass the magnetic needle which in these regions had pointed about  from the north pole had never deviated in the least--a proof that although east and west had apparently changed places north and south continued to retain their normal position as cardinal points the log and the compass therefore were now to be called upon to do the work of the sextant and chronometer which had become utterly useless on the first morning of the cruise lieutenant procope who like most russians spoke french fluently was explaining these peculiarities to cap- tain servadac the count was present and the con- versation perpetually recurred as naturally it would to the phenomena which remained so inex- plicable to them all it is very evident said the lieutenant that ever since the st of january the earth has been moving in a new orbit and from some unknown cause has drawn nearer to the sun no doubt about that said servadac  and i suppose that having crossed the orbit of venus we  amazing stories have a good chance of running into the orbit of mercury and finish up by a collision with the sun added the count there is no fear of that sir the earth has undoubtedly entered upon a new orbit but she is not incurring any probable risk of being precipi- tated into the sun can you satisfy us of that asked the count i can sir i can give you a proof which i think you will own is conclusive if as you suppose the earth is being drawn on so as to be precipitated against the sun the great center of attraction of our system it could only be because the centrifugal and centripetal forces that cause the planets to rotate in their several orbits had been entirely sus- pended in that case indeed the earth would rush onwards towards the sun and in sixty-four days and a half the catastrophe you dread would inevit- ably happen and what demonstration do you offer asked servadac eagerly that it will not happen  simply this captain that since the earth en- tered her new orbit half the sixty-four days has already elapsed and yet it is only just recently that she has crossed the orbit of venus hardly one-third of the distance to be traversed to reach the sun the lieutenant paused to allow time for reflec- tion and added moreover i have every reason to believe that we are not so near the sun as we have been the temperature has been gradually diminishing the heat upon gourbi island is not greater now than we might ordinarily expect to find in algeria at the same time we have the problem still unsolved that the mediterranean has evidently been transported to the equatorial zone both the count and the captain expressed them- selves reassured by his representations and ob- served that they must now do all in their power to discover what had become of the vast continent of africa of which they were hitherto failing so completely to find a vestige twenty-four hours after leaving the island the dobryna had passed over the sites where tenes cherchil koleah and sidi-feruch once had been but of these towns not one appeared within range of the telescope ocean reigned supreme lieu- tenant procope was absolutely certain that he had not mistaken his direction the compass showed that the wind had never shifted from the west and this with the rate of speed as estimated by the log com- bined to assure him that at this date the nd of february the schooner was in lat   n and long   e the very spot which ought to have been occupied by the algerian capital but algiers like all the other coast-towns had apparently been absorbed into the bowels of the earth captain servadac with clenched teeth and knit- ted brow stood sternly almost fiercely regarding the boundless waste of water his pulse beat fast as he recalled the friends and comrades with whom he had spent the last few years in that vanished city all the images of his past life floated upon his memory his thoughts sped away to his native france only to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the algerian metropolis is it not impossible he murmured aloud that any city should disappear so completely would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible surely some portion of the casbah must still rise above the waves the imperial fort too was built upon an elevation of  feet it is in- credible that it should be so totally submerged un- less some vestiges of these are found i shall begin to suspect that the whole of africa has been swal- lowed in some vast abyss another circumstance was most remarkable not a material object of any kind was to be noticed float- ing on the surface of the water not one branch of a tree had been seen drifting by nor one spar be- longing to one of the numerous vessels that a month previously had been moored in the magnificent bay which stretched twelve miles across from cape matafuz to point pexade perhaps the depths might disclose what the surface failed to reveal and count timascheff anxious that servadac should have every facility afforded him for solving his doubts called for the sounding-line forthwith the lead was greased and lowered to the surprise of all and especially of lieutenant procope the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniform depth of from four to five fathoms and although the sound- ing was persevered with continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area the differences of level were insignificant not corresponding in any degree to what would be expected over the site of a city that had been terraced like the seats of an amphitheater astounding as it seemed what alter- native was left but to suppose that the algerian capital had-been completely leveled by the flood the sea-bottom was composed of neither rock mud sand nor shells the sounding-lead brought up nothing but a kind of metallic dust which glit- tered with a strange iridescence and the nature of which it was impossible to determine as it wa totally unlike what had ever been known to be raised from the bed of the mediterranean you must see lieutenant i should think that we are not so near the coast of algeria as you im- agined the lieutenant shook his head after pondering awhile he said if we were farther away i should expect to find a depth of two or three hundred fathoms instead of five fathoms five fathoms i confess i am puzzled for the next thirty-six hours until the th of february the sea was examined and explored with the most unflagging perseverance its depth re- mained invariable still four or at most five fathoms and although its bottom was assiduously dredged it was only to prove it barren of marine production of any type the yacht made its way to lat  north by refer- ence to the charts it was tolerably certain that she was cruising over the site of the sahel the ridge that had separated the rich plain of the mitidja from the sea and of which the highest peak mount bourjerah had reached an altitude of  feet but even this peak which might have been expected to emerge like an islet above the surface of the sea was nowhere to be traced nothing was to be done but to put about and return in disappointment to- wards the north thus the dobryna regainedthe waters of the mediterranean without discovering a trace of the missing province of algeria off on a comet  chapter xi an island tomb no longer then could there be any doubt as to the annihilation of a considerable portion of the colony not merely had there been a submersion of the land but the impression was more and more confirmed that the very bowels of the earth must have yawned and closed again upon a large terri- tory of the rocky substratum of the province it became more evident than ever that not a trace re- mained and a new soil of unknown formation had certainly taken the place of the old sandy sea-bot- tom as it altogether transcended the powers of those on board to elucidate the origin of this catas- trophe it was felt to be incumbent on them at least to ascertain its extent after a long and somewhat wavering discussion it was at length decided that the schooner should take advantage of the favorable wind and weather and proceed at first towards the east thus following the outline of what had formerly represented the coast of africa until that coast had been lost in boundless sea not a vestige of it all remained from cape mata- fuz to tunis it had all gone as though it had never been the maritime town of dellis built like algiers amphitheater-wise had totally disap- peared the highest points were quite invisible not a trace on the horizon was left of the jurjura chain the topmost point of which was known to have an altitude of more than  feet unsparing of her fuel the dobryna made her way at full steam towards cape blanc neither cape negro nor cape serrat was to be seen the town of bizerta once charming in its oriental beauty had vanished utterly its marabouts or temple- tombs shaded by magnificent palms that fringed the gulf which by reason of its narrow mouth had the semblance of a lake all had disappeared giving place to a vast waste of sea the transparent waters of which as still demonstrated by the sounding-line had ever the same uniform and arid bottom in the course of the day the schooner rounded the point where five weeks previously cape blanc had been so conspicuous an object and she was now stemming the waters of what once had been the bay of tunis but bay there was none and the town from which it had derived its name with the arsenal the goletta and the two peaks of bou- kournein had all vanished from the view cape bon too the most northern promontory of africa and the point of the continent nearest to the island of sicily had been included in the general devas- tation before the occurrence of the recent prodigy the bottom of the mediterranean just at this point had formed a sudden ridge across the straits of libya the sides of the ridge had shelved to so great an extent that while the depth of water on the summit had been little more than eleven fathoms that on either hand of the elevation was little short of a hundred fathoms a formation such as this plainly indicated that at some remote epoch cape bon had been connected with cape furina the extremity of sicily in the same manner as ceuta has doubtless been connected with gibraltar lieutenant procope was too well acquainted with the mediterranean to be unaware of this peculiarity and would not lose the opportunity of ascertaining whether the submarine ridge still existed or whether the sea-bottom between sicily and africa had undergone any modification both timascheff and servadac were much in- terested in jvatching the operations at a sign from the lieutenant a sailor who was stationed at the foot of the fore-shrouds dropped the sounding-lead into the water and in reply to procope's inquiries reported--five fathoms and a flat bottom the next aim was to determine the amount of depression on either side of the ridge and for this purpose the dobryna was shifted for a distance of half a mile both to the right and left and the sound- ings taken at each station five fathoms and a flat bottom was the unvaried announcement after each operation not only therefore was it evident that the submerged chain between cape bon and cape furina no longer existed but it was equally clear that the convulsion had caused a general level- ing of the sea-bottom and that the soil degenerated as it has been said into a metallic dust of unrecog- nized composition bore no trace of the sponges sea-anemones star-fish sea-nettles hydrophytes and shells with which the submarine rocks of the mediterranean had hitherto been prodigally clothed the dobryna now put about and resumed her explorations in a southerly direction it remained however as remarkable as ever how completely throughout the voyage the sea continued to be de- serted  all expectations of hailing a vessel bearing news from europe were entirely falsified so that more and more each member of the crew began to be conscious of his isolation and to believe that the schooner like a second noah's ark carried the sole survivors of a calamity that had overwhelmed the earth on the th of february the dobryna passed over the site of the city of dido the ancient byrsa-- a carthage however which was now more com- pletely annihilated than ever punic carthage had been destroyed by scipio africanus or roman carthage by hassan the saracen in the evening as the sun was sinking below the eastern horizon captain servadac was lounging moodily against the taffrail from the heaven above where stars kept peeping fitfully from be- hind the moving clouds his eye wandered mechan- ically to the waters below where the long waves were rising and falling with the evening breeze all at once his attention was arrested by a lu- minous speck straight ahead on the southern hor- izon at first imagining that he was the victim of some spectral illusion he observed it with silent attention but when after some minutes he became convinced that what he saw was actually a distant light he appealed to one of the sailors by whom his impression was fully corroborated the intelligence was immediately imparted to count timascheff and the lieutenant is it land do you suppose inquired servadac eagerly i should be more inclined to think it is a light on board some ship replied the count whatever it is in another hour we shall know all about it said servadac no captain interposed lieutenant procope we shall know nothing until to-morrow  amazing stories what not bear down upon it at once asked the count in surprise no sir i should much rather lie to and wait till daylight if we are really near land i should be afraid to approach it in the dark the count expressed his approval of the lieu- tenant's caution and thereupon all sail was short- ened so as to keep the dobryna from making any considerable progress all through the hours of night few as those hours were they seemed to those on board as if their end would never come fearful lest the faint glimmer should at any moment cease to be visible hector servadac did not quit his post upon the deck but the light continued unchanged it shone with about the same degree of luster as a star of the second magnitude and from the fact of its remaining stationary procope became more and more convinced that it was on land and did not belong to a passing vessel at sunrise every telescope was pointed with keenest interest towards the center of attraction the light of course had ceased to be visible but in the direction where it had been seen and at a distance of about ten miles therfe was the distinct outline of a solitary island of very small extent rather as the count observed it had the appearance of being the projecting summit of a mountain all but submerged whatever it was it was agreed that its true character must be ascertained not only to gratify their own curiosity but for the benefit of all future navigators the schooner accordingly was steered directly towards it and in less than an hour had cast anchor within a few cables lengths of the shore the little island proved to be nothing more than an arid rock rising abruptly about forty feet above the water it had no outlying reefs a circumstance that seemed to suggest the probability that in the recent convulsion it had sunk gradually until it had reached its present position of equilibrium without removing his eye from his telescope ser- vadac exclaimed there is a habitation on the place i can see an erection of some kind quite dis- tinctly who can tell whether we shall not come across a human being lieutenant procope looked doubtful the island had all the appearance of being deserted nor did a cannon-shot fired from the schooner have the effect of bringing any resident to the shore neverthe- less it was undeniable that there was a stone build- ing situated on the top of the rock and that this building had much the character of an arabian mosque the boat was lowered and manned by the four sailors servadac timascheff and procope were quickly rowed ashore and lost no time in commenc- ing their ascent of the steep acclivity upon reach- ing the summit they found their progress arrested by a kind of wall or rampart of singular construc- tion its materials consisting mainly of vases frag- ments of columns carved bas-reliefs statues and portions of broken stelse all piled promiscuously together without any pretense to artistic arrange- ment they made their way into the enclosure and finding an open door they passed through and soon came to a second door also open which ad- mitted them to the interior of the mosque consist- ing of a single chamber the walls of which were ornamented in the arabian style by sculptures of indifferent execution in the center was a tomb of the very simplest kind and above the tomb was suspended a large silver lamp with a capacious res- ervoir of oil in which floated a long lighted wick the flame of which was evidently the light that had attracted servadac's attention on the previous night must there not have been a custodian of the shrine they mutually asked but if such there had ever been he must they concluded either have fled or have perished on that eventful night not a soul was there in charge and the sole living occu- pants were a flock of wild cormorants which star- tled at the entrance of the intruders rose on wing and took a rapid flight towards the south an old french prayer-book was lying on the corner of the tomb the volume was open and the page exposed to view was that which contained the office for the celebration of the th of august a sudden revelation dashed across servadac's mind the solemn isolation of the island tomb the open breviary the ritual of the ancient anniversary all combined to apprise him of the sanctity of the spot upon which he stood the tomb of st louis he exclaimed and his companions involuntarily followed his example and made a reverential obeisance to the venerated monu- ment it was in truth the very spot on which tradition asserts that the canonized monarch came to die a spot to which for six centuries and more his coun- trymen had paid the homage of a pious regard the lamp that had been kindled at the memorial shrine of a saint was now in all probability the only beacon that threw a light across the waters of the mediterranean and even this ere long must itself expire there was nothing more to explore the three together quitted the mosque and descended the rock to the shore whence their boat re-conveyed them to the schooner which was soon again on her south- ward voyage and it was not long before the tomb of st louis the only spot that had survived the mysterious shock was lost to view chapter xii at the mercy op the winds as the affrighted cormorants had winged their flight towards the south there sprang up a sanguine hope on board the schooner that land might be dis- covered in that direction thither accordingly it was determined to proceed and in a few hours after quitting the island of the tomb the dobryna was traversing the shallow waters that now covered the peninsula of dakhul which had separated the bay of tunis from the gulf of hammamet for two days she continued an undeviating course and after a futile search for the coast of tunis reached the latitude of  north here on the th of february there suddenly arose the cry of land and in the extreme horizon right ahead where land had never been before it was true enough that a shore was distinctly to be seen what could it be it could not be the coast of tripoli for not only would that low-lying shore be quite invisible at such a distance but it was certain moreover that it lay two degrees at least still further south it was soon observed that this off on a comet  newly discovered land was of very irregular eleva- tion that it extended due east and west across the horizon thus dividing the gulf into two separate sections and completely concealing the island of jerba which must lie behind its position was duly traced on the dobryna's chart how strange exclaimed hector servadac that after sailing all this time over sea where we ex- pected to find land we have at last come upon land where we thought to find sea strange indeed replied lieutenant procope and what appears to me almost as remarkable is that we have never once caught sight either of one of the maltese tartans or one of the levantine xebecs that traffic so regularly on the mediterra- nean eastwards or westwards asked the count-- which shall be our course all farther progress to the south is checked westwards by all means replied servadac quickly i am longing to know whether anything of algeria is left beyond the shelif besides as we pass gourbi island we might take ben zoof on board and then make away for gibraltar where we should be sure to learn something at least of european news with his usual air of stately courtesy count tima- scheff begged the captain to consider the yacht at his own disposal and desired him to give the lieu- tenant instructions accordingly lieutenant procope however hesitated and after revolving matters for a few moments in his mind pointed out that as the wind was blowing directly from the west and seemed likely to increase if they went to the west in the teeth of the weather the schooner would be reduced to the use of her engine only and would have much difficulty in making good headway on the other hand by taking an eastward course not only would they have the advantage of the wind but under steam and canvas might hope in a few days to be off the coast of egypt and from alexandria or some other port they would have the same opportunity of getting tidings from europe as they would at gibraltar intensely anxious as he was to revisit the prov- ince of oran and eager too to satisfy himself of the welfare of his faithful ben zoof servadac could not but own the reasonableness of the lieutenant's objections and yielded to the proposal that the east- ward course should be adopted the wind gave signs only too threatening of the breeze rising to a gale but fortunately the waves did not culminate in combers but rather in a long swell which ran in the same direction as the vessel during the last fortnight the high temperature had been gradually diminishing until it now reached an average of  cent or  fahr and sometimes descended as low as  that this dim- inution was to be attributed to the change in the earth's orbit was a question that admitted of little doubt after approaching so near to the sun as to cross the orbit of venus the earth must now have receded so far from the sun that its normal distance of ninety-one millions of miles was greatly in- creased and the probability was great that it was approximating to the orbit of mars that planet which in its physical constitution most nearly re- sembles our own nor was this supposition sug- gested merely by the lowering of the temperature it was strongly corroborated by the reduction of the apparent diameter of the sun's disc to the pre- cise dimensions which it would assume to an ob- server actually stationed on the surface of mars the necessary inference that seemed to follow from these phenomena was that the earth had been pro- jected into a new orbit which had the form of a very elongated ellipse very slight however in comparison was the re- gard which these astronomical wonders attracted on board the dobryna all interest there was too much absorbed in terrestrial matters and in ascertaining what changes had taken place in the configuration of the earth itself to permit much attention to be paid to its erratic movements through space the schooner kept bravely on her way but well out to sea at a distance of two miles from land there was good need of this precaution for so precipitous was the shore that a vessel driven upon it must inevitably have gone to pieces it did not offer a single harbor of refuge but smooth and perpendicular as the walls of a fortress it rose to a height of two hundred and occasionally of three hundred feet the waves dashed violently against its base upon the general substratum rested a massive conglomerate the crystallizations of which rose like a forest of gigantic pyramids and obelisks but what struck the explorers more than anything was the appearance of singular newness that per- vaded the whole of the region it all seemed so recent in its formation that the atmosphere had had no opportunity of producing its wonted effect in softening the hardness of its lines in rounding the sharpness of its angles or in modifying the color of its surface its outline was clearly marked against the sky and its substance smooth and polished as though fresh from a founder's mold glittered with the metallic brilliancy that is char- acteristic of pyrites it seemed impossible to come to any other conclusion but that the land before them continent or island had been upheaved by subterranean forces above the surface of the sea and that it was mainly composed of the same metal- lic element as had characterized the dust so fre- quently uplifted from the bottom the extreme nakedness of the entire tract was likewise very extraordinary elsewhere in various quarters of the globe there may be sterile rocks but there are none so adamant as to be altogether unfurrowed by the crevices engendered in the moist residuum of the condensed vapor elsewhere there may be barren steeps but none so arid as not to afford some hold to vegetation however low and elementary may be its type but here all was bare and blank and desolate--not a symptom of vitality was visible such being the condition of the adjacent land it could hardly be a matter of surprise that all the sea-birds the albatross the gull the sea-mew sought continual refuge on the schooner day and night they perched fearlessly upon the yards the report of a gun failing to dislodge them and when food of any sort was thrown upon the deck they would dart down and fight with eager voracity for the prize their extreme avidity was recognized as a proof that any land where they could obtain a sustenance must be very remote onwards thus for several days the dobryna fol- lowed the contour of the inhospitable coast of which  amazing stories the features would occasionally change sometimes for two or three miles assuming the form of a simple arris sharply defined as though cut by a chisel when suddenly the prismatic lamellae soaring in rugged confusion would again recur but all along there was the same absence of beach or tract of sand to mark its base neither were there any of those shoals of rock that are ordinarily found in shallow water at rare intervals there were some narrow fissures but not a creek available for a ship to enter to replenish its supply of water and the wide roadsteads were unprotected and exposed to well-nigh every point of the compass but after sailing two hundred and forty miles the progress of the dobryna was suddenly arrested lieutenant procope who had sedulously inserted the outline of the newly revealed shore upon the maps announced that it had ceased to run east and west and had taken a turn due north thus forming a barrier to their continuing their previous direc- tion it was of course impossible to conjecture how far this barrier extended it coincided pretty nearly with the fourteenth meridian of east long- itude and if it reached as probably it did beyond sicily to italy it was certain that the vast basin of the mediterranean which had washed the shores alike of europe asia and africa must have been reduced to about half its original area it was resolved to proceed upon the same plan as heretofore following the boundary of the land at a safe distance accordingly the head of the dob- ryna was pointed north making straight as it was presumed for the south of europe a hundred miles or somewhat over in that direction and it was to be anticipated she would come in sight of malta if only that ancient island the heritage in succession of phoenicians carthaginians sicilians romans vandals greeks arabians and the knights of rhodes should still be undestroyed but malta too was gone and when upon the th the sounding-line was dropped upon its site it was only with the same result so oftentimes ob- tained before the devastation is not limited to africa ob- served the count assuredly not assented the lieutenant adding and i confess i am almost in despair whether we shall ever ascertain its limits to what quarter of europe if europe still exists do you propose that i should now direct your course to sicily italy france ejaculated servadac eagerly--anywhere where we can learn the truth of what has befallen us how if we are the sole survivors said the count gravely hector servadac was silent his own secret pre- sentiment so thoroughly coincided with the doubts expressed by the count that he refrained from say- ing another word the coast without deviation still tended towards the north no alternative therefore remained than to take a westerly course and to attempt to reach the northern shores of the mediterranean on the th day the dobryna essayed to start upon her altered way but it seemed as if the elements had conspired to obstruct her progress a furious tempest arose the wind beat dead in the direction of the coast and the danger incurred by a vessel of a tonnage so light was necessarily very great lieutenant procope was extremely uneasy he took in all sail struck his topmasts and resolved to rely entirely on his engine but the peril seemed only to increase enormous waves caught the schooner and carried her up to their crests whence again she was plunged deep into the abysses that they left the screw failed to keep its hold upon the water but continually revolved with useless speed in the vacant air and thus although the steam was forced on to the extremest limit con- sistent with safety the vessel held her way with the utmost difficulty and recoiled before the hurri- cane still not a single resort for refuge did the in- hospitable shore present again and again the lieutenant asked himself what would become of him and his comrades even if they should survive the peril of shipwreck and gain a footing upon the cliff what resources could they expect to find upon that scene of desolation what hope could they enter- tain that any portion of the old continent still ex- isted beyond that dreary barrier it was a trying time but throughout it all the crew behaved with the greatest courage and com- posure confident in the skill of their commander and in the stability of their ship they performed their duties with steadiness and unquestioning obedience but neither skill nor courage nor obedience could avail all was in vain despite the strain put upon her engine the schooner bare of canvas for not even the smallest stay-sail could have withstood the violence of the storm was drifting with ter- rific speed towards the menacing precipices which were only a few short miles to leeward fully alive to the hopelessness of their situation the crew were all on deck all over with us sir said procope to the count i have done everything that man could do but our case is desperate nothing short of a miracle can save us now within an hour we must go to pieces upon yonder rocks let us then commend ourselves to the provi- dence of him to whom nothing is impossible re- plied the count in a calm clear voice that could be distinctly heard by all and as he spoke he rever- ently uncovered an example in which he was fol- lowed by all the rest the destruction of the vessel seeming thus in- evitable lieutenant procope took the best measures he could to insure a few days supply of food for any who might escape ashore he ordered several cases of provisions and kegs of water to be brought on deck and saw that they were securely lashed to some empty barrels to make them float after the ship had gone down less and less grew the distance from the shore but no creek no inlet could be discerned in the towering wall of cliff which seemed about to topple over and involve them in annihilation except a change of wind or as procope observed a superna- tural rifting of the rock nothing could bring de- liverance now but the wind did not veer and in a few minutes more the schooner was hardly three cables distance from the fatal land all were aware that their last moment had arrived serva- dac and the count grasped each others hands for a long farewell and tossed by the tremendous waves the schooner was on the very point of being hurled off on a comet  upon the cliff when a ringing shout was heard quick boys quick hoist the jib and right the helm sudden and startling as the unexpected orders were they were executed as if by magic the lieutenant who had shouted from the bow rushed astern and took the helm and before any- one had time to speculate upon the object of his maneuvers he shouted again look out sharp watch the sheets an involuntary cry broke forth from all on board but it was no cry of terror right ahead was a narrow opening in the solid rock it was hardly forty feet wide whether it was a passage or not it mattered little it was at least a refuge and driven by wind and wave the dobryna under the dexterous guidance of the lieutenant dashed in between its perpendicular walls had she not immured herself in a perpetual prison chapter xiii a royal salute then i take your bishop major said colonel murphy as he made a move that he had taken since the previous evening to consider i was afraid you would replied major oliphant looking intently at the chess-board such was the way in which a long silence was broken on the morning of the th of february by the old calendar another day elapsed before another move was made it was a protracted game it had in fact already lasted some months--the players being so deliberate and so fearful of taking a step without the most mature consideration that even now they were only making the twentieth move both of them moreover were rigid disciples of the renowned philidor who pronounces that to play the pawns well is the soul of chess and accord- ingly not one pawn had been sacrificed without a most vigorous defense the men who were thus beguiling their leisure were two officers in the british army--colonel heneage finch murphy and major sir john temple oliphant remarkably similar in personal appear- ance they were hardly less so in personal character both of them were about forty years of age both of them were tall and fair with bushy whiskers and mustaches both of them were phlegmatic in tem- perament and both much addicted to the wearing of their uniforms they were proud of their na- tionality and exhibited a manifest dislike verging upon contempt for everything foreign probably they would have felt no surprise if they had been told that anglo-saxons were fashioned out of some specific clay the properties of which surpassed the investigation of chemical analysis without any intentional disparagement they might in a certain way be compared to two scarecrows which though perfectly harmless in themselves inspire some measure of respect and are excellently adapted to protect the territory intrusted to their guardian- ship english-like the two officers had made themselves thoroughly at home in the station abroad in which it had been their lot to be quartered the faculty of colonization seems to be indigenous to the native character once let an englishman plant his na- tional standard on the surface of the moon and it would not be long before a colony would be estab- lished around it the officers had a servant named kirke and a company of ten soldiers of the line this party of thirteen men were apparently the sole survivors of an overwhelming catastrophe which on the st of january had transformed an enormous rock gar- risoned with well-nigh two thousand troops into an insignificant island far out to sea but although the transformation had been so marvelous it can- not be said that either colonel murphy or major oliphant had made much demonstration of astonish- ment this is all very peculiar sir john observed the colonel yes colonel very peculiar replied the major england will be sure to send for us said one officer no doubt she will answered the other accordingly they came to the mutual resolution that they would stick to their post to say the truth it would have been a difficult matter for the gallant officers to do otherwise they had but one small boat therefore it was well that they made a virtue of necessity and resigned them- selves to patient expectation of the british ship which in due time would bring relief they had no fear of starvation their island was mined with subterranean stores more than ample for thirteen men--nay for thirteen englishmen-- for the next five years at least preserved meat ale brandy--all were in abundance consequently as the men expressed it they were in this respect all right of course the physical changes that had taken place had attracted the notice both of officers and men but the reversed position of east and west the diminution of the force of gravity the altered rotation of the earth and her projection upon a new orbit were all things that gave them little con- cern and no uneasiness and when the colonel and the major had replaced the pieces on the board which had been disturbed by the convulsion any surprise they might have felt at the chess-men los- ing some portion of their weight was quite for- gotten in the satisfaction of seeing them retain their equilibrium one phenomenon however did not fail to make its due impression upon the men this was the dim- inution in the length of day and night three days after the catastrophe corporal pim on behalf of himself and his comrades solicited a formal inter- view with the officers the request having been granted pim with the nine soldiers all punctili- ously wearing the regimental tunic of scarlet and trousers of invisible green presented themselves at the door of the colonel's room where he and his brother-officer were continuing their game raising his hand respectfully to his cap which he wore poised jauntily over his right ear and scarcely held on by the strap below his under lip the corporal waited permission to speak after a lingering survey of the chess-board the colonel slowly lifted his eyes and said with official dignity well men what is it first of all sir replied the corporal we want to speak to you about our pay and then we wish  amazing stories to have a word with the major about our rations say on then said colonel murphy what is it about your pay just this sir as the days are only half as long as they were we should like to know whether our pay is to be diminished in proportion the colonel was taken somewhat aback and did not reply immediately though by some significant nods towards the major he indicated that he thought the question very reasonable after a few moments reflection he replied it must i think be allowed that your pay was calculated from sun- rise to sunrise there was no specification of what the interval should be your pay will continue as before england can afford it a buzz of approval burst involuntarily from all the men but militai-y discipline and the respect due to their officers kept them in check from any boisterous demonstration of their satisfaction and now corporal what is your business with me asked major oliphant we want to know whether as the days are only six hours long we are to have but two meals instead of four the officers looked at each other and by their glances agreed that the corporal was a man of sound common sense eccentricities of nature said the major can- not interfere with military regulations it is true that there will be but an interval of an hour and a half between them but the rule stands good--four meals a day england is too rich to grudge her soldiers any of her soldiers due yes four meals a day hurrah shouted the soldiers unable this time to keep their delight within the bounds of military decorum and turning to the right-about they marched away leaving the officers to renew the all- absorbing game however confident everyone upon the island might profess to be that succor would be sent them from their native land--for britain never abandons any of her sons--it could not be disguised that that succor was somewhat tardy in making its appear- ance many and various were the conjectures to account for the delay perhaps england was en- grossed with domestic matters or perhaps she was absorbed in diplomatic difficulties or perchance more likely than all northern europe had received no tidings of the convulsion that had shattered the south the whole party throve remarkably well up- on the liberal provisions of the commissariat de- partment and if the officers failed to show the same tendency to embonpoint which was fast becoming characteristic of the men it was only because they deemed it due to their rank to curtail any indul- gences which might compromise the fit of their uni- form on the whole time passed indifferently well an englishman rarely suffers from ennui and then only in his own counti'y when required to conform to what he calls the humbug of society and the two officers with their similar tastes ideas and dispositions got on together admirably it is not to be questioned that they were deeply affected by a sense of regret for their lost comrades and as- tounded beyond measure at finding themselves the sole survivoi's of a garrison of  men but with true british pluck and self-control they had done nothing more than draw up a report that  names were missing from the muster-roll the island itself the sole surviving fragment of an enormous pile of rock that had reared itself some  feet above the sea was not strictly speaking the only land that was visible for about twelve miles to the south there was another island ap- parently the very counterpart of what was now oc- cupied by the englishmen it was only natural that this should awaken some interest even in the most imperturbable minds and there was no doubt that the two officers during one of the rare inter- vals when they were not absorbed in their game had decided that it would be desirable at least to ascer- tain whether the island was deserted or whether it might not be occupied by some others like them- selves survivors from the general catastrophe cer- tain it is that one morning when the weather was bright and calm they had embarked alone in the little boat and been absent for seven or eight hours not even to corporal pim did they communicate the object of their excursion nor say one syllable as to its result and it could only be inferred from their manner that they were quite satisfied with what they had seen and very shortly afterwards major oliphant was observed to draw up a lengthy docu- ment which was no sooner finished than it was formally signed and sealed with the seal of the rd regiment it was directed to the first lord of the admiralty london and kept in readiness for transmission by the first ship that should hail in sight but time elapsed and here was the th of february without an op- portunity having been afforded for any communica- tion with the british government at breakfast that morning the colonel observed to the major that he was under the most decided impression that the th of february was a royal anniversary and he went on to say that although he had received no definite instructions on the sub- ject he did not think that the peculiar circum- stances under which they found themselves should prevent them from giving the day its due military honors the major quite concurred and it was mutually agreed that the occasion must be honored by a bumper of port and by a royal salute corporal pim must be sent for the corporal soon made his appearance smacking his lips having by a ready intuition found a pretext for a double morning ra- tion of spirits the th of february you know pim said the colonel we must have a salute of twenty-one guns very good replied pim a man of few words and take care that your fellows don't get their arms and legs blown off added the officer very good sir said the corporal and he made his salute and withdrew of all the bombs howitzers and various species of artillery with which the fortress had been crowd- ed one solitary piece remained this was a cum- brous muzzle-loader of -inch caliber and in default of the smaller ordnance generally employed for the purpose had to be brought into requisition for the royal salute a sufficient number of charges having been pro- vided the corporal brought his men to the reduct off on a comet  whence the gun's mouth projected over a sloping embrasure the two officers in cocked hats and full staff uniform attended to take charge of the proceedings the gun was maneuvered in strict accordance with the rules of the artilleryman's manual and the firing commenced not unmindful of the warning he had received the corporal was most careful between each dis- charge to see that every vestige of fire was extin- guished so as to prevent an untimely explosion while the men were reloading and accidents such as so frequently mar public rejoicings were all happily avoided much to the chagrin of both colonel murphy and major oliphant the effect of the salute fell alto- gether short of their anticipations the weight of the atmosphere was so reduced that there was com- paratively little resistance to the explosive force of the gases liberated at the cannon's mouth and there was consequently none of the reverberation like rolling thunder that ordinarily follows the dis- charge of heavy artillery twenty times had the gun been fired and it was on the point of being loaded for the last time when the colonel laid his hand upon the arm of the man who had the ramrod stop he said we will have a ball this time let us put the range of the piece to the test a good idea replied the major corporal you hear the orders in quick time an artillery-wagon was on the spot and the men lifted out a full-sized shot weighing  lbs which under ordinary circumstances the cannon would carry about four miles it was pro- posed by means of telescopes to note the place where the ball first touched the water and thus to obtain an approximation sufficiently accurate as to the true range having been duly charged with powder and ball the gun was raised to an angle of something under  so as to allow proper development to the curve that the projectile would make and at a signal from the major the light was applied to the priming heavens by all that's good exclaimed both officers in one breath as standing open-mouthed they hardly knew whether they were to believe the evidence of their own senses is it possible the diminution of the force of attraction at the earth's surface was so considerable that the ball had sped beyond the horizon incredible ejaculated the colonel incredible echoed the major six miles at least observed the one ay more than that replied the other awhile they gazed at the sea and at each other in mute amazement but in the midst of their per- plexity what sound was that which startled them was it mere fancy was it the reverberation of the cannon still booming in their ears or was it not truly the report of another and a distant gun in answer to their own attentively and eagerly they listened twice thrice did the sound repeat itself it was quite distinct there could be no mistake i told you so cried the colonel triumphantly i knew our country would not forsake us it is an english ship no doubt in half an hour two masts were visible above the horizon see was i not right our country was sure to send to our relief here is the ship yes replied the major she responded to our gun it is to be hoped muttered the corporal that our ball has done her no damage before long the hull was full in sight a long trail of smoke betokened her to be a steamer and very soon by the aid of the glass it could be as- certained that she was a schooner-yacht and mak- ing straight for the island a flag at her mast- head fluttered in the breeze and towards this the two officers with the keenest attention respectively adjusted their glasses simultaneously the two telescopes were lowered the colonel and the major stared at each other in blank astonishment russian they gasped and true it was that the flag that floated at the head of yonder mast was the blue cross of russia chapter xiv sensitive nationality when the schooner had approached the island the englishmen were able to make out the name dobryna painted on the stern a sinuous irregularity of the coast had formed a kind of cove which though hardly spacious enough for a few fishing-smacks would afford the yacht a temporary anchorage so long as the wind did not blow violently from either west or south into this cove the dob- ryna was duly signaled and as soon as she was safely moored she lowered her four-oar and count timascheff and captain servadac made their way at once to land colonel heneage finch murphy and major sir john temple oliphant stood grave and prim form- ally awaiting the arrival of their visitors captain servadac with the uncontrolled vivacity natural to a frenchman was the first to speak a joyful sight gentlemen he exclaimed it will give us unbounded pleasure to shake hands again with some of our fellow-creatures you no doubt have escaped the same disaster as ourselves but the english officers neither by word nor gesture made the slightest acknowledgment of this familiar greeting what news can you give us of france england or russia continued servadac perfectly uncons- cious of the stolid rigidity with which his advances were received we are anxious to hear anything you can tell us have you had communications with europe have you-- to whom have we the honor of speaking at last interposed colonel murphy in the coldest and most measured tone and drawing himself up to his full height ah how stupid i forgot said servadac with the slightest possible shrug of the shoulders we have not been introduced then with a wave of his hand towards his com- panion who meanwhile had exhibited a reserve hardly less than that of the british officers he said allow me to introduce you to count wassili timascheff major sir john temple oliphant replied the colonel the russian and the englishman mutually ex- changed the stiffest of bows  amazing stories i have the pleasure of introducing captain ser- vadac said the count in his turn and this is colonel heneage finch murphy was the major's grave rejoinder more bows were interchanged and the ceremony brought to its due conclusion it need hardly be said that the conversation had been carried on in french a language which is generally known both by russians and englishmen--a circumstance that is probably in some measure to be accounted for by the refusal of frenchmen to learn either russian or english the formal preliminaries of etiquette being thus complete there was no longer any obstacle to a freer intercourse the colonel signing to his guests to follow led the way to the apartment occupied jointly by himself and the major which although only a kind of casemate hollowed in the rock nevertheless wore a general air of comfort major oliphant ac- companied them and all four having taken their seats the conversation started irritated and disgusted at all the cold formalities hector servadac resolved to leave all the talking to the count and he quite aware that the english- men would adhere to the fiction that they could be supposed to know nothing that had transpired previ- ous to the introduction felt himself obligated to re- capitulate matters from the very beginning you must be aware gentlemen began the count that a most singular catastrophe occurred on the st of january last its cause its limits we have utterly failed to discover but from the ap- pearance of the island on which we find you here you have evidently experienced its devastating con- sequences  the englishmen in silence bowed assent captain servadac who accompanies me con- tinued the count has been most severely tried by the disaster engaged as he was in an important mission as a staff-officer in algeria- a french colony i believe interposed major oliphant half shutting his eyes with an expression of supreme indifference servadac was on the point of making some cutting retort but count timascheff without allowing the interruption to be noticed calmly continued his nar- rative  it was near the mouth of the shelif that a por- tion of africa on that eventful night was trans- formed into an island which alone survived the rest of the vast continent disappeared as completely as if it had never been the announcement seemed by no means startling to the phlegmatic colonel indeed was all he said and where were you asked major oliphant i was out at sea cruising in my yacht hard by and i look upon it as a miracle and nothing less that i and my crew escaped with our lives i congratulate you on your luck replied the major the count resumed it was about a month after the great disruption that i was sailing--my engine having sustained some damage in the shock--along the algerian coast and had the pleasure of meeting with my previous acquaintance captain servadac who was resident upon the island with his orderly ben zoof ben who inquired the major zoof ben zoof ejaculated servadac who could scarcely shout loud enough to relieve his pent- up feelings ignoring this ebulition of the captain's spleen the count went on to say captain servadac was naturally most anxious to get what news he could accoi'dingly he left his servant on the island in charge of his horses and came on board the dob- ryna with me we were quite at a loss to know where we should steer but decided to direct our course to what previously had been the east in order that we might if possible discover the col- ony of algeria but of algeria not a trace re- mained the colonel curled his lip insinuating only too plainly that to him it was by no means surprising that a french colony should be wanting in the ele ment of stability servadac observed the super- cilious look and half rose to his feet but smother- ing his resentment took his seat again without speaking the devastation gentlemen said the count who persistently refused to recognize the french- man's irritation everywhere was terrible and com- plete not only was algeria lost but there was no trace of tunis except one solitary rock which was crowned by an ancient tomb of one of the kings of france- louis the ninth i presume observed the colonel saint louis blurted out servadac savagely colonel murphy slightly smiled proof against all interruption count timascheff as if he had not heard it went on without pausing he related how the schooner had pushed her way onwards to the south and had reached the gulf of cabes and how she had ascertained for certain that the sahara sea had no longer an existence the smile of disdain again crossed the colonel's face he could not conceal his opinion that such a destiny for the work of a frenchman could be no matter of surprise our next discovery continued the count was that a new coast had been upheaved right along in front of the coast of tripoli the geological forma- tion of which was altogether strange and which extended to the north as far as the proper place of malta and malta cried servadac unable to control himself any longer malta--town forts soldiers governor and all--has vanished just like algeria for a moment a cloud rested upon the colonel's brow only to give place to an expression of de- cided incredulity the statement seems highly incredible he said incredible repeated servadac why is it that you doubt my word  the captain's rising wrath did not prevent the colonel from replying coolly because malta belongs to england i can't help that answered servadac sharply it has gone just as utterly as if it had belonged to china colonel murphy turned deliberately away from servadac and appealed to the count do you not think you may have made some error count in reckoning the bearings of your yacht no colonel i am quite certain of my reckonings and not only can i testify that malta has disap- off on a comet  peared but i can affirm that a large section of the mediterranean has been closed in by a new contin- ent after the most anxious investigation we could discover only one narrow opening in all the coast and it is by following that little channel that we have made our way hither england i fear has suffered grievously by the late catastrophe not only has malta been entirely lost but of the ionian islands that were under england's protec- tion there seems to be but little left ay you may depend upon it said servadac breaking in upon the conversation petulantly your grand resident lord high commissioner has not much to congratulate himself about in the con- dition of corfu the englishmen were mystified corfu did you say asked major oliphant yes corfu i said corfu replied servadac with a sort of malicious triumph the officers were speechless with astonishment the silence of bewilderment was broken at length by count timascheff making inquiry whether nothing had been heard from england either by telegraph or by any passing ship no said the colonel not a ship has passed and the cable is broken but do not the italian telegraphs assist you continued the count italian i do not comprehend you you must mean the spanish surely how demanded timascheff confound it cried the impatient servadac what matters whether it be spanish or italian tell us have you had no communication at all from europe--no news of any sort from london hitherto none whatever replied the colonel adding with a stately emphasis but we shall be sure to have tidings from england before long whether england is still in existence or not i suppose said servadac in a tone of irony the englishmen started simultaneously to their feet england in existence the colonel cried eng- land ten times more probable that france- france shouted servadac in a passion france is not an island that can be submerged france is an integral portion of a solid continent france at least is safe a scene appeared inevitable and count tima- scheff's efforts to conciliate the excited parties were of small avail you are at home here said servadac with as much calmness as he could command it will be advisable i think for this discussion to be carried on in the open air and hurriedly he left the room followed immediately by the others he led the way to a level piece of ground which he considered he might fairly claim as neutral territory now gentlemen he began haughtily permit me to represent that in spite of any loss france may have sustained in the fate of algeria france is ready to answer any provocation that affects her honor here i am the representative of my country and here on neutral ground- neutral ground objected colonel murphy i beg your pardon this captain servadac is eng- lish territory do you not see the english flag and as he spoke he pointed with national pride to the british standard floating over the top of the island pshaw cried servadac with a contemptuous sneer that flag you know has been hoisted but a few short weeks that flag has floated where it is for ages as- serted the colonel an imposture shouted servadac as he stamped with rage recovering his composure in a degree he con- tinued  can you suppose that i am not aware that this island on which wre find you is what remains of the ionian representative republic over which you eng- lish exercise the right of protection but have no claim of government the colonel and the major looked at each other in amazement although count timascheff secretly sympathized with servadac he had carefully refrained from tak- ing part in the dispute but he was on the point of interfering when the colonel in a greatly subdued tone begged to be allowed to speak i begin to apprehend he said that yew must be laboring under some strange mistake there is no room for questioning that the territory here is england's--england's by right of conquest ceded to england by the treaty of utrecht three times indeed--in   and --france and spain have disputed our title but always to no purpose you are i assure you at the present moment as much on english soil as if you were in london in the middle of trafalgar square it was now the turn of the captain and the count to look surprised are we not then in corfu they asked you are at gibraltar replied the colonel gibraltar the word fell like a thunderclap up- on their ears gibraltar the western extremity of the mediterranean why had they not been sail- ing persistently to the east could they be wrong in imagining that they had reached the ionian is- lands what new mystery was this count timascheff was about to proceed with a more rigorous investigation when the attention of all was arrested by a loud outcry turning round they saw that the crew of the dobryna was in hot dispute with the english soldiers a general alter- cation had arisen from a disagreement between the sailor panofka and corporal pim it had trans- pired that the cannon-ball fired in experiment from the island had not only damaged one of the spars of the schooner but had broken panofka's pipe and moreover had just grazed his nose which for a russian's was unusually long the discussion over this mishap led to mutual recriminations till the sailors had almost come to blows with the gar- rison servadac was just in the mood to take panofka's part which drew fom major oliphant the remark that england could not be held responsible for any accidental injury done by her cannon and if the russian's long nose came in the way of the ball the russian must submit to the mischance this was too much for count timascheff and having poured out a torrent of angry invective against the english officers he ordered his crew to embark immediately  amazing stories we shall meet again said servadac as they pushed off from shore whenever you please was the cool reply the geographical mystery haunted the minds of both the count and the captain and they felt they could never rest till they had ascertained what had become of their respective countries they were glad to be on board again that they might resume their voyage of investigation and in two hours were out of sight of the sole remaining fragment of gibraltar chapter xv an enigma from the sea lieutenant procope had been left on board in charge of the dobryna and on resuming the voyage it was a task of some difficulty to make him under- stand the fact that had just come to light some hours were spent in discussion and in attempting to penetrate the mysteries of the situation there were certain things of which they were perfectly certain they could be under no misappre- hension as to the distance they had positively sailed from gourbi island towards the east before their further progress was arrested by the unknown shore as nearly as possible that was fifteen de- grees the length of the narrow strait by which they had made their way across that land to regain the open sea was about three miles and a half thence onward to the island which they had been assured on evidence that they could not disbelieve to be upon the site of gibraltar was four degrees while from gibraltar to gourbi island was seven degrees or but little more what was it altogether was it not less than thirty degrees in that lati- tude the degree of longitude represents eight and forty miles what then did it all amount to  in- dubitably to less than  miles so brief a voyage would bring the dobryna once again to her starting- point or in other words would enable her to com- plete the circumnavigation of the globe how changed the condition of things previously to sail from malta to gibraltar by an eastward course would have involved the passage of the suez canal the red sea the indian ocean the pacific the at- lantic but what had happened now why gibraltar had been reached as if it had been just at corfu and some three hundred and thirty degrees of the earth's circuit had vanished utterly after allowing for a certain margin of miscalcu- lation the main fact remained undeniable and the necessary inference that lieutenant procope drew from the round of the earth being completed in  miles was that the earth's diameter had been reduced by about fifteen sixteenths of its length if that be so observed the count it accounts for some of the strange phenomena we witness if our world has become so insignificant a spheroid not only has its gravity diminished but its rotary speed has been accelerated and this affords an ade- quate explanation of our days and nights being thus curtailed but how about the new orbit in which we are moving he paused and pondered and then looked at pro- cope as though awaiting from him some further elucidation of the difficulty the lieutenant hesi- tated when in a few moments he began to speak servadac smiled intelligently anticipating the answer he was about to hear my conjecture is said procope that a frag- ment of considerable magnitude has been detached from the earth that it has carried with it an en- velope of the earth's atmosphere and that it is now traveling through the solar system in an orbit that does not correspond at all with the proper orbit of the earth the hypothesis was plausible but what a multi- tude of bewildering speculations it entailed if in truth a'certain mass had been broken off from the terrestrial sphere whither would it wend its way what would be the measure of the eccentricity of its path what would be its period round the sun might it not like a comet be carried away into the vast infinity of space or on the other hand might it not be attracted to the great central source of light and heat and be absorbed in it did its orbit correspond with the plane of the ecliptic and was there no chance of its ever uniting again with the globe from which it had been torn off by so sudden and violent a disruption a thoughtful silence fell upon them all which servadac was the first to break lieutenant he said your explanation is ingenious and accounts for many appearances but it seems to me that in one point it fails how so replied procope to my mind the theory meets all objections i think not servadac answered in one point at least it appears to me to break down completely what is that asked the lieutenant stop a moment said the captain let us see that we understand each other right unless i mistake you your hypothesis is that a fragment of the earth comprising the mediterranean and its shores from gibi-altar to malta has been developed into a new asteroid which is started on an inde- pendent orbit in the solar regions is not that your meaning precisely so the lieutenant acquiesced well then continued servadac it seems to me to be at fault in this respect it fails and fails com- pletely to account for the geological character of the land that we have found now encompassing this sea why if the new land is a fragment of the old --why does it not retain its old formation what has become of the granite and the calcareous de- posits how is it that these should all be changed into a mineral concrete with which we have no acquaintance no doubt it was a serious objection for how- ever likely it might be that a mass of the earth on being detached would be eccentric in its movements there was no probable reason to be alleged why the material of its substance should undergo so com- plete a change there was nothing to account for the fertile shores rich in vegetation being trans- formed into rocks arid and barren beyond precedent the lieutenant felt the difficulty and owned him- self unprepared to give at once an adequate solu- tion nevertheless he declined to renounce his theory he asserted that the arguments in favor of it carried conviction to his mind and that he entertained no doubt but that in the course of time all apparently antagonistic circumstances would be explained so as to become consistent with the view he took he was careful however to make it un- off on a comet  derstood that with respect to the original cause of the disruption he had no theory to offer and al- though he knew what expansion might be the result of subterranean forces he did not venture to say that he considered it sufficient to produce so tre- mendous an effect the origin of the catastrophe was a problem still to be solved ah well said servadac i don't know that it matters much where our new little planet comes from or what it is made of if only it carries france along with it and russia added the count and russia of course said servadac with a polite bow there was however not much room for this sanguine expectation for if a new asteroid had thus been brought into existence it must be a sphere of extremely limited dimensions and there could be little chance that it embraced more than the merest fraction of either france or russia as to eng- land the total cessation of all telegraphic communi- cation between her shores and gibraltar was a vir- tual proof that england was beyond its compass and what was the time measurement of the new little world at gourbi island the days and nights were of equal length and this seemed to indicate that it was situated on the equator hence the dis- tance by which the two poles stood apart would be half what had been reckoned would be the distance completed by the dobryna in her circuit that dis- tance had been already estimated to be something under  miles so that the arctic pole of their recently fashioned world must be about  miles to the north and the antarctic about  miles to the south of the island compare these calcula- tions with the map and it is at once apparent that the northernmost limit barely touched the coast of provence while the southernmost reached to about lat  n and fell in the heart of the desert the practical test of these conclusions would be made by future investigation but meanwhile the fact appeared very much to strengthen the presumption that if lieutenant procope had not arrived at the whole truth he had made a considerable advance towards it the weather ever since the storm that had driven the dobryna into the creek had been magnificent the wind continued favorable and now under both steam and canvas she made a rapid progress to- wards the north a direction in which she was free to go in consequence of the total disappearance of the spanish coast from gibraltar right away to alicante malaga almeria cape gata cartagena cape palos--all were gone the sea was rolling over the southern extent of the peninsula so that the yacht advanced to the latitude of seville before it sighted any land at all and then not shores such as the shores of andalusia but a bluff and precipi- tous cliff in its geological features resembling exactly the stern and barren rock that she had coasted beyond the site of malta here the sea made a decided indentation on the coast it ran up in an acute-angled triangle till its apex coincided with the very spot upon which madrid had stood but as hitherto the sea had encroached upon the land the land in its turn now encroached upon the sea for a frowning headland stood out far into the basin of the mediterranean and formed a pro- montory stretching out beyond the proper places of the balearic isles curiosity was all alive there was the intensest interest awakened to determine whether any vestige could be traced of majorca minorca or any of the group and it was during a deviation from the direct course for the purpose of a more thorough scrutiny that one of the sailors raised a thrill of general excitement by shouting a bottle in the sea here then at length was a communication from the outer world surely now they would find a docu- ment which would throw some light upon all the mysteries that had happened had not the day now dawned that should set their speculations all at rest it was the morning of the st of february the count the captain the lieutenant everybody hurried to the forecastle the schooner was dexterously put about and all was eager impatience until the sup- posed bottle was hauled on deck it was not however a bottle it proved to be a round leather telescope-case about a foot long and the first thing to do before investigating its con- tents was to make a careful examination of its ex- terior the lid was fastened on by wax and so securely that it would take a long immersion before any water could penetrate there was no maker's name to be deciphered but impressed very plainly with a seal on the wax were the two initials p r when the scrutiny of the outside was finished the wax was removed and the cover opened and the lieutenant drew out a slip of ruled paper evidently torn from a common note-book the paper had an inscription written in four lines which were re- markable for the profusion of notes of admiration and interrogation with which they were inter- spersed  gallia ab sole au  fev    chemin parcouru de janv a fev     va bene all right parfait there was a general sigh of disappointment they turned the paper over and over and handed it from one to another what does it all mean  exclaimed the count something mysterious here said servadac but yet he continued after a pause one thing is tolerably certain on the th six days ago someone was alive to write it yes i presume there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the date assented the count to this strange conglomeration of french eng- lish italian and latin there was no signature at- tached nor was there anything to give a clue as to the locality in which it had been committed to the waves a telescope-case would probably be the property of some one on board a ship and the figures obviously referred to the astronomical won- ders that had been experienced to these general observations captain servadac objected that he thought it unlikely that any one on board a ship would use a telescope-case for this pur- pose but would be sure to use a bottle as being more secure and accordingly he should rather be in- clined to believe that the message had been set afloat by some savant left alone perchance upon some isolated coast but however interesting it might be observed the count to know the author of the lines to ua  amazing stories it is of far greater moment to ascertain their meaning and taking up the paper again he said perhaps we might analyze it word by word and from its detached parts gather some clue to its sense as a whole what can be the meaning of all that cluster of interrogations after gallia asked servadac lieutenant procope who had hitherto not spoken now broke his silence by saying i beg gentlemen to submit my opinion that this document goes very far to confirm my hypothesis that a fragment of the earth has been precipitated into space captain servadac hesitated and then replied even if it does i do not see how it accounts in the least for the geological character of the new asteroid but will you allow me for one minute to take my supposition for granted said procope if a new little planet has been formed as i imagine by disin- tegration from the old i should conjecture that gallia is the name assigned to it by the writer of this paper the very notes of interrogation are significant that he was in doubt what he should write you would presume that he was a frenchman asked the count i should think so replied the lieutenant not much doubt about that said servadac it is all in french except a few scattered words of english latin and italian inserted to attract attention he could not tell into whose hands the message would fall first well then said count timascheff we seem to have found a name for the new world we occupy but what i was going especially to observe continued the lieutenant is that the distance  leagues represents precisely the distance we ourselves were from the sun on the th it was on that day we crossed the orbit of mars yes true assented the others and the next line said the lieutenant after reading it aloud apparently registers the distance traversed by gallia the new little planet in her own orbit her speed of course we know by kep- ler's laws would vary according to her distance from the sun and if she were--as i conjecture from the temperature at that date--on the th of jan- uary at her perihelion she would be traveling twice as fast as the earth which moves at the rate of between  and  miles an hour you think then said servadac with a smile you have determined the perihelion of our orbit but how about the aphelion can you form a judg- ment as to what distance we are likely to be car- ried you are asking too much remonstrated the count i confess said the lieutenant that just at present i am not able to clear away the uncertainty of the future but i feel confident that by careful observation at various points we shall arrive at con- clusions which not only will determine our path but perhaps may clear up the mystery about our geological structure allow me to ask said count timascheff whether such a new asteriod would not be subject to ordinary mechanical laws and whether once started it would not have an orbit that must be immutable decidedly it would so long as it was undisturbed by the attraction of some considerable body but we must recollect that compared to the great planets gallia must be almost infinitsimally small and so might be attracted by a force that is irre- sistable altogether then said servadac we seem to have settled it to our entire satisfaction that we must be the population of a young little world called gallia perhaps some day we may have the honor of being registered among the minor planets no chance of that quickly rejoined lieutenant procope those minor planets all are known to rotate in a narrow zone between the orbits of mars and jupiter in their perihelia they cannot ap- proximate the sun as we have done we shall not be classed with them our lack of instruments said the count is much to be deplored it baffles our investigations in every way ah never mind keep up your courage count said servadac cheerily and lieutenant procope renewed his assurances that he entertained good hopes that every perplexity would soon be solved i suppose remarked the count that we cannot attribute much importance to the last line va bene all right parfait the captain answered at least it shows that whoever wrote it had no murmuring or complaint to make but was quite content with the new order of things chapter xvi the residuum of a continent almost unconsciously the voyagers in the dob- ryna fell into the habit of using gallia as the name of the new world in which they became aware they must be making an extraordinary excursion through the realms of space nothing however was al- lowed to divert them from their ostensible object of making a survey of - the coast of the mediter- ranean and accordingly they persevered in follow- ing that singular boundary which had revealed it- self to their extreme astonishment having rounded the great promontory that had barred her farther progress to the north the schooner skirted its upper edge a few more lea- gues and they ought to be abreast of the shores of france yes of france but who shall describe the feelings of hector servadac when instead of the charming outline of his native land he beheld nothing but a solid bound- ary of savage rock who shall paint the look of consternation with which he gazed upon the stony rampart--rising perpendicularly for a thousand feet--that had replaced the shores of the smiling south who shall reveal the burning anxiety with which he throbbed to see beyond that cruel wall but there seemed no hope onwards and on- wards the yacht made her way and still no sign of france it might have been supposed that ser- vadac's previous experiences would have prepared him for the discovery that the catastrophe which had overwhelmed other sites had brought destruc- tion to his own country as well but he had failed off on a comet  to realize how it might extend to france and when now he was obliged with his own eye to witness the waves of ocean rolling over what once had been the lovely shores of provence he was well-nigh frantic with desperation am i to believe that gourbi island that little shred of algeria constitutes all that is left of our glorious france no no it cannot be not yet have we reached the pole of our new world there is--there must be--something more behind that frowning rock oh that for a moment we could scale its towering height and look beyond by heaven i adjure you let us disembark and mount the summit and explore france lies beyond disembarkation however was an utter impossi- bility there was no semblance of a creek in which the dobryna could find an anchorage there was no outlying ridge on which a footing could be gained the precipice was perpendicular as a wall its topmost height crowned with the same con- glomerate of crystallized lamellaj that had all along been so pronounced a feature with her steam at high presure the yacht made rapid progress towards the east the weather re- mained perfectly fine the temperature became grad- ually cooler so that there was little prospect of vapors accumulating in the atmosphere and nothing more than a few cirri almost transparent veiled here and there the clear azure of the sky through- out the day the pale rays of the sun apparently lessened in its magnitude cast only faint and some- what uncertain shadows but at night the stars shone with surpassing brilliancy of the planets some it was observed seemed to be fading away in remote distance this was the case with mars venus and that unknown orb which was moving in the orbit of the minor planets but jupiter on the other hand had assumed splendid proportions saturn was superb in its luster and uranus which hitherto had been imperceptible without a telescope was pointed out by lieutenant procope plainly visible to the naked eye the inference was irre- sistible that gallia was receding from the sun and traveling far away across the planetary regions on the th of february after following the sinuous course of what before the date of the con- vulsion had been the coast line of the department of var and after a fruitless search for hydres the peninsula of st tropez the lrius islands and the gulfs of cannes and jouar the dobryna arrived upon the site of the cape of antibes here quite unexpectedly the explorers made the discovery that the massive wall of cliff had been rent from the top to the bottom by a narrow rift like the dry bed of a mountain torrent and at the base of the opening level with the sea was a little strand upon which there was just space enough for their boat to be hauled up joy joy shouted servadac half beside him- self with ecstasy we can land at last count timascheff and the lieutenant were scarce- ly less impatient than the captain and little needed his urgent and repeated solicitations come on quick come on no time to lose it was half-past seven in the morning when they set their foot upon this untried land the bit of strand was only a few square yards in area quite a narrow strip upon it might have been recog- nized some fragments of that agglutination of yel- low limestone which is characteristic of the coast of provence but the whole party was far too eager to wait and examine these remnants of the ancient shore they hurried on to scale the heights the narrow ravine was not only perfectly dry but manifestly had never been the bed of any moun- tain torrent the rocks that rested at the bottom --just as those which formed its sides--were of the same lamellous formation as the entire coast and had not hitherto been subject to the disaggre- gation which the lapse of time never fails to work a skilled geologist would probably have been able to assign them their proper scientific classification but neither servadac timascheff nor the lieutenant could pretend to any acquaintance with their specific character although however the bottom of the chasm had never as yet been the channel of a stream indica- tions were not wanting that at some future time it would be the natural outlet of accumulated waters for already in many places thin layers of snow were glittering upon the surface of the frac- tured rocks and the higher the elevation that was gained the more these layers were found to in- crease in area and in depth here is a trace of fresh water the first that gallia has exhibited said the count to his com- panions as they toiled up the precipitous path and probably replied the lieutenant as we ascend we shall find not only snow but ice we must suppose this gallia of ours to be a sphere and if it is so we must now be very close to her arctic regions it is true that her axis is not so much inclined as to prolong day and night as at the poles of the earth but the rays of the sun must reach us here only very obliquely and the cold in all likeli- hood will be intense so cold do you think asked servadac that animal life must be extinct i do not say that captain answered the lieu- tenant for however far our little world may be removed from the sun i do not see why its tem- perature should fall below what prevails in those outlying regions beyond our system where sky and air are not and what temperature may that be inquired the captain with a shudder fourier estimates that even in those vast un- fathomable tracts the temperature never descends lower than  below zero said procope sixty sixty degrees below zero cried the count why there's not a russian could endure it i beg your pardon count it is placed on rec- ord that the english have survived it or something quite approximate upon their arctic expeditions when captain parry was on melville island he knew the thermometer to fall to -- said procope as the explorers advanced they seemed glad to pause from time to time that they might recover their breath for the air becoming more and more rarefied made respiration somewhat difficult and the ascent fatiguing before they had reached an altitude of  feet they noticed a sensible diminu- tion of the temperature but neither cold nor fatigue deterred them and they were resolved to persevere fortunately the deep stria or furrows in the surface of the rocks that made the bottom  amazing stories off on a comet of the ravine in some degree facilitated their prog- ress but it was not until they had been toiling up for two hours more that they succeeded in reaching the summit of the cliff eagerly and anxiously did they look around to the south there was nothing but the sea they had traversed to the north nothing but one drear in- hospitable stretch servadac could not suppress a cry of dismay where was his beloved france had he gained this arduous height only to behold the rocks carpeted with ice and snow and reaching interminably to the far-off horizon his heart sank within him the whole region appeared to consist of nothing but the same strange uniform mineral conglomer- ate crystallized into regular hexagonal prisms but whatever was its geological character it was only too evident that it had entirely replaced the former soil so that not a vestige of the old continent of europe could be discerned the lovely scenery of provence with the grace of its rich and undulating landscape its gardens of citrons and oranges rising tier upon tier from the deep red soil--all all had vanished of the vegetable kingdom there was not a single representative the most meager of arctic plants the most insignificant of lichens could obtain no hold upon that stony waste nor did the animal world assert the feeblest sway the mineral kingdom reigned supreme captain servadac's deep dejection was in strange contrast to his general hilarity silent and tear- ful he stood upon an ice-bound rock straining his eyes across the boundless vista of the mysterious territory it cannot be he exclaimed we must somehow have mistaken our bearings true we have encountered this barrier but france is there beyond yes france is there come count come by all that's pitiful i entreat you come and ex- plore the farthest verge of the ice-bound track he pushed onwards along the rugged surface of the rock but had not proceeded far before he came to a sudden pause his foot had come in contact with something hard beneath the snow and stoop- ing down he picked up a little block of stony sub- stance which the first glance revealed to be of a geological character altogether alien to the uni- versal rocks around it proved to be a fragment of discolored marble on which several letters were inscribed of which the only part at all decipherable was the syllable vil vil--villa he cried out in his excitement dropping the marble which was broken into atoms by the fall what else could this fragment be but the sole surviving remnant of some sumptuous mansion that once had stood on this unrivaled site was it not the residue of some edifice that had crowned the luxuriant headlands of antibes overlooking nice and commanding the gorgeous panorama that embraced the maritime alps and reached beyond monaco and mentone to the italian height of bor- dighera and did it not give in its sad and too convincing testimony that antibes itself had been involved in the great destruction servadac gazed upon the shattered marble pensive and dis- heartened count timascheff laid his hand kindly on the captain's shoulder and said my friend do you not remember the motto of the old hope family he shook his head mournfully orbe fracto spes illaesa continued the count-- though the world be shattered hope is unim- paired servadac smiled faintly and replied that he felt rather compelled to take up the despairing cry of dante all hope abandon ye who enter here nay not so answered the count for the pres- ent at least let our maxim be nil desperandum chapter xvii a second enigma upon re-embarking the bewildered explorers began to discuss the question whether it would not now be desirable to make their way back to gourbi island which was apparently the only spot in their new world from which they could hope to derive their future sustenance captain servadac tried to console himself with the reflection that gourbi is- land was after all a fragment of a french colony and as such almost like a bit of his dear france and the plan of returning thither was on the point of being adopted when lieutenant procope re- marked that they ought to remember that they had not hitherto made an entire circuit of the new shores of the sea on which they were sailing we have he said neither investigated the northern shore from the site of cape antibes to the strait that brought us to gibraltar nor have we followed the southern shore that stretches from the strait to the gulf of cabes it is the old coast and not the new that we have been tracing as yet we cannot say positively that there is no out- let to the south as yet we cannot assert that no oasis of the african desert has escaped the catas- trophe perhaps even here in the north we may find that italy and sicily and the larger islands of the mediterranean may still maintain their exist- ence i entirely concur with you said count tima- scheff i quite think we ought to make our survey of the confines of this new basin as complete as possible before we withdraw servadac although he acknowledged the justness of these observations could not help pleading that the explorations might be deferred until after a visit had been paid to gourbi island depend upon it captain you are mistaken replied the lieutenant the right thing to do is to use the dobryna while she is available available what do you mean asked the count somewhat taken by surprise i mean said procope that the farther this gallia of ours recedes from the sun the lower the temperature will fall it is likely enough i think that before long the sea will be frozen over and navigation will be impossible already you have learned something of the difficulties of traversing a field of ice and i am sure therefore you will acquiesce in my wish to continue our explorations while the water is still open no doubt you are right lieutenant said the count we will continue our search while we can for some remaining fragment of europe who shall tell whether we may not meet with some more sur- vivors from the catastrophe to whom it might be in our power to afford assistance before we go into our winter quarters off on a comet  generous and altogether unselfish as this senti- ment really was it was obviously to the general interest that they should become acquainted and if possible establish friendly relations with any human inhabitant who might be sharing their own strange destiny in being rolled away upon a new planet into the infinitude of space all difference of race all distinction of nationality must be merged into the one thought that few as they were they were the sole surviving representatives of a world which it seemed exceedingly improbable that they would ever see again and common sense dic- tated that they were bound to direct all their ener- gies to insure that their asteroid should at least have a united and sympathizing population it was on the th of february that the yacht left the little creek in which she had taken refuge and setting off at full steam eastwards she continued her way along the northern shore a brisk breeze tended to increase the keenness of the temperature the thermometer being on an average about two degrees below zero salt water freezes only at a lower temperature than fresh the course of the dobryna was therefore unimpeded by ice but it could not be concealed that there was the greatest necessity to maintain the utmost possible speed the nights continued lovely the chilled condition of the atmosphere prevented the formation of clouds the constellations gleamed forth with un- sullied luster and much as lieutenant procope from nautical considerations might regret the ab- sence of the moon he could not do otherwise than own that the magnificent nights of gallia were such as must awaken the enthusiasm of an astronomer and as if to compensate for the loss of the moon- light the heavens were illuminated by a superb shower of falling stars far exceeding both in num- ber and in brilliancy the phenomena which are com- monly distinguished as the august and november meteors in fact gallia was passing through that meteoric ring which is known to lie exterior to the earth's orbit but almost concentric with it the rocky coast its metallic surface reflecting the glow of the dazzling luminaries appeared literally stip- pled with light whilst the sea as though spattered with burning hailstones shone with a phosphore- scence that was perfectly splendid so great how- ever was the speed at which gallia was receding from the sun that this meteoric storm lasted scarcely more than four and twenty hours next day the direct progress of the dobryna was arrested by a long projection of land which obliged her to turn southwards until she reached what formerly would have been the southern extremity of corsica of this however there was now no trace the strait of bonfacio had been replaced by a vast expanse of water which had at first all the appearance of being utterly desert but on the fol- lowing morning the explorers unexpectedly sighted a little island which unless it should prove as was only too likely to be of recent origin they concluded from its situation must be a portion of the north- ernmost territory of sardinia the dobryna approached the land as nearly as was prudent the boat was lowered and in a few minutes the count and servadac had landed upon the islet which was a mere plot of meadow land not much more than two acres in extent dotted here and there with a few myrtle-bushes and lentisks interspersed with some ancient olives having as- certained as they imagined that the spot was de- void of living creature they were on the point of returning to their boat when their attention was arrested by a faint bleating and immediately after- wards a solitary she-goat came bounding towards the shore the creature had dark almost black hair and small curved horns and was a specimen of that domestic breed which with considerable justice has gained for itself the title of the poor man's cow so far from being alarmed at the presence of strangers the goat ran nimbly towards them and then by its movements and plaintive cries seemed to be enticing them to follow it come said servadac let us see where it will lead us it is more than probable it is not alone the count agreed and the animal as if compre- hending what was said trotted on gently for about a hundred paces and stopped in front of a kind of cave or burrow that was half concealed by a grove of lentisks here a little girl seven or eight years of age with rich brown hair and lustrous dark eyes beautiful as one of murillo's angels was peeping shyly through the branches apparently discover- ing nothing in the aspect of the strangers to excite her apprehensions the child suddenly gained con- fidence darted forwards with outstretched hands and in a voice soft and melodious as the language which she spoke said in italian i like you you will not hurt me will you hurt you my child answered servadac no indeed we will be your friends we will take care of you and after a few moments scrutiny of the pretty maiden he added tell us your name little one nina was the child's reply well then nina can you tell us where we are at madalena i think said the little girl at least i know i was there when that dreadful shock came and altered everything the count knew that madalena was close to cap- rera to the north of sardinia which had entirely disappeared in the disaster by dint of a series of questions he gained from the child a very in- telligent account of her experiences she told him that she had no parents and had been employed in taking care of a flock of goats belonging to one of the landowners when one day all of a sudden everything around her except this little piece of land had been swallowed up and that she and marzy her pet goat had been left quite alone she went on to say that at first she had been very fright- ened but when she found that the earth did not shake any more she had thanked the great god and had soon made herself very happy living with mar- zy she had enough food she said and had been waiting for a boat to fetch her and now a boat had come and she was quite ready to go away only they must let her goat go with her they would both like so much to get back to the old farm here at least is one nice little inhabitant of gallia said captain servadac as he caressed the child and conducted her to the boat half an hour later both nina and marzy were safely quartered on board the yacht it is needless to say that they received the heartiest of welcomes the russian sailors ever superstitious seemed al-  amazing stories most to regal'd the coming of the child as the ap- pearance of an angel and incredible as it may seam more than one of them wondered whether she had wings and amongst themselves they commonly referred to her as the little madonna soon out of sight of madalena the dobryna for some hours held a southeasterly course along the shore which here was fifty leagues in advance of the former coast-line of italy demonstrating that a new continent must have been formed substituted as it were for the old peninsula of which not a vestige could be identified at a latitude corre- sponding with the latitude of rome the sea took the form of a deep gulf extending back far beyond the site of the eternal city the coast making a wide sweep round to the former position of cala- bria and jutting far beyond the outline of the boot which italy resembles but the beacon of messina was not to be discerned no trace indeed survived of any portion of sicily the very peak of etna  feet as it had reared itself above the level of the sea had vanished utterly another sixty leagues to the south and the dob- ryna sighted the entrance of the strait which had afforded her so pi-ovidential a refuge from the tempest and had conducted her to the fragmentary relic of gibraltar hence to the gulf of cabes had been already explored and as it was universally al- lowed that it was unnecessary to renew the search in that direction the lieutenant started off in a transverse course towards a point hitherto unin- vestigated that point was reached on the rd of march and thence the coast was continuously fol- lowed as it led through what had been tunis across the province of constantine away to the oasis of ziban where taking a sharp turn it first reached a latitude of  n and then returned again thus forming a sort of irregular gulf enclosed by the same unvarying border of mineral concrete this colossal boundary then stretched away for nearly  leagues over the sahara desert and extending to the south of gourbi island occupied what if morocco had still existed would have been its natural frontier  adapting her course to these deviations of the coastline the dobryna was steering northwards and had barely reached the limit of the bay when the attention of all on board was arrested by the phenomenon of a volcano at least  feet high its crater crowned with smoke which occasionally was streaked by tongues of flame a burning mountain they exclaimed gallia then has some internal heat said ser- vadac and why not captain rejoined the lieutenant if our asteroid has carried with it a portion of the old earth's atmosphere why should it not like- wise retain something of its central fire ah welll said the captain shrugging his shoulders i dare say there is caloric enough in our little world to supply the wants of its popula- tion count timascheff interrupted the silence that followed this conversation by saying and now gentlemen as our course has brought us on our way once more towards gibraltar what do you say to our renewing our acquaintance with the english- men they will be interested in the result of our voyage for my part said servadac i have no desire that way they know where to find gourbi island they can betake themselves thither just when they please they have plenty of provisions if the water freezes  leagues is no very great distance the reception they gave us was not so cordial that we need put ourselves out of the way to repeat our visit what you say is too true replied the count i hope we shall show them better manners when they condescend to visit us ay said servadac we must remember that we are all one people now no longer russian french or english nationality is extinct i am sadly afraid however continued the count that an englishman will be an englishman ever yes said the captain that is always their failing and thus all further thought of making their way again to the little garrison of gibraltar was abandoned but even if their spirit of courtesy had disposed them to renew their acquaintance with the british officers there were two circumstances that just then would have rendered such a proposal very in- advisable in the first place lieutenant procope was convinced that it could not be much longer now before the sea would be entirely frozen and besides this the consumption of their coal through the speed they had maintained had been so great that there was only too much reason to fear that fuel would fail them anyhow the strictest econ- omy was necessary and it was accordingly resolved that the voyage should not be much prolonged be- yond the volcanic peak moreover the waters seemed to expand into a boundless ocean and it might be a thing full of risk to be frozen up while the yacht was so inadequately provisioned taking all these things into account it was agreed that further in- vestigations should be deferred to a more favorable season and that without delay the dobryna should return to gourbi island this decision was especially welcome to hector servadac who throughout the whole of the last five weeks had been agitated by much anxious thought on account of the faithful servant he had left behind the transit from the volcano to the island was not long and was marked by only one noticeable incident this was the finding of a second mysteri- ous document in character precisely similar to what they had found before the writer of it was evi- dently engaged upon a calculation probably con- tinued from day to day as to the motions of the planet gallia upon its orbit and committing the results of his reckonings to the waves as the chan- nel of communication instead of being enclosed in a telescope-case it was this time secured in a preserved-meat tin hermetically sealed and stamped with the same initials on the wax that fastened it the greatest care was used in opening it and it was found to contain the following message gallia  ab sole au  mars dist   chemin parcouru de fev a mars    va bene all right nil desperandum enchante off on a comet  another enigma exclaimed servadac and still no intelligible signature and no address no clearing up of the mystery i have no doubt in my own mind said the count that it is one of a series it seems to me probable that they are being sent broadcast upon the sea i wonder where the hare-brained savant that writes them can be living observed servadac very likely he may have met with the fate of aesop's abstracted astronomer who found himself at the bottom of a well aye but where is that well demanded the captain this was a question which the count was in- capable of settling and they could only speculate afresh as to whether the author of the riddles was dwelling upon some solitary island or like them- selves was navigating the waters of the new med- iterranean but they could detect nothing to guide them to a definite decision after thoughtfully regarding the document for some time lieutenant procope proceeded to ob- serve that he believed the paper might be con- sidered as genuine and accordingly taking its statements as reliable he deduced two important conclusions first that whereas in the month of january the distance traveled by the planet hypo- thetically called gallia had been recorded as -  leagues the distance traveled in february was only  leagues--a difference of -  leagues in one month secondly that the distance of the planet from the sun which on the th of february had been  leagues was on the st of march  leagues--an increase of  leagues in a fortnight thus in pro- portion as gallia receded from the sun so did the rate of speed diminish by which she traveled along her orbit facts to be observed in perfect conform- ity with the known laws of celestial mechanism and your inference asked the count my inference replied the lieutenant is a con- firmation of my surmise that we are following an orbit decidedly elliptical although we have not yet the material to determine its eccentricity as the writer adheres to the appellation of gallia do you not think asked the count that we might call these new waters the gallian sea there can be no l-eason to the contrary count replied the lieutenant and as such i will insert it upon my new chart our friend said servadac seems to be more and more gratified with the condition of things not only has he adopted our motto nil desperan- dum but see how enthusiastically he has wound up with his enchantd  the conversation dropped a few hours later the man on watch announced that gourbi island was in sight chapter xviii an unexpected population the dobryna was now back again at the island her cruise had lasted from the st of january to the th of march a period of thirty-five days for it was leap year corresponding to seventy days as accomplished by the new little world many a time during his absence hector servadac had wondered how his present vicissitudes would end and he had felt some misgivings as to whether he should ever again set foot upon the island and see his faithful orderly so that it was not without emotion that he had approached the coast of the sole remaining fragment of algerian soil but his apprehensions were groundless gourbi island was just as he had left it with nothing unusual in its aspect except that a very peculiar cloud was hover- ing over it at an altitude of little more than a hun- dred feet as the yacht approached the shore this cloud appeared to rise and fall as if acted upon by some invisible agency and the captain after watch- ing it carefully pei-ceived that it was not an accumu- lation of vapors at all but a dense mass of birds packed as closely together as a swarm of herrings and uttering deafening and discordant cries amidst which from time to time the noise of the report of a gun could be plainly distinguished the dobryna signalized her arrival by firing her cannon and dropped anchor in the little port of the shelif almost within a minute ben zoof was seen running gun in hand towards the shore he cleared the last ridge of rocks at a single bound and then suddenly halted for a few seconds he stood mo- tionless his eyes fixed as if obeying the instruc- tions of a drill sergeant on a point some fifteen yards distant his whole attitude indicating sub- mission and respect but the sight of the captain who was landing was too much for his equanimity and darting forward he seized his master's hand and covered it with kisses instead however of uttering any expressions of welcome or rejoicing at the captain's return ben zoof broke out into the most vehement ejaculations thieves captain beastly thieves bedouins pirates devils why ben zoof what's the matter said ser- vadac soothingly they are thieves downright desperate thieves those infernal birds that's what's'the matter it is a good thing you have come hei'e have i for a whole month been spending my powder and shot upon them and the more i kill them the worse they get and yet if i were to leave them alone we should not have a grain of corn upon the island it was soon evident that the orderly had only too much cause for alarm the crops had ripened rapidly during the excessive heat of january when the orbit of gallia was being traversed at its peri- helion and were now exposed to the depredations of many thousands of birds and although a goodly number of stacks attested the industry of ben zoof during the time of the dobryna's voyage it was only too apparent that the portion of the harvest that remained ungathered was liable to the most imminent risk of being utterly devoured it was perhaps only natural that this clustered mass of birds as representing the whole of the feathered tribe upon the surface of gallia should resort to gourbi island of which the meadows seemed to be the only spot from which they could get sustenance at all but as this sustenance would be obtained at the expense and probably to the serious detriment of the human population it wras absolutely neces- sary that every possible resistance shouldbe made to the devastation that was threatened once satisfied that servadac and his friends would co-operate with him in the raid upon the thieves  amazing stories ben zoof became calm and content and began to make various inquiries and what has become he said of all our old comrades in africa as far as i can tell you answered the captain they are all in africa still only africa isn't by any means where we expected to find it and france montmartre continued ben zoof eagerly here was the cry of the poor fellow's heart as briefly as he could servadac endeavored to explain the true condition of things he tried to communicate the fact that paris france europe nay the whole world was more than eighty millions of leagues away from gourbi island as gently and cautiously as he could he expressed his fear that they might never see europe france paris mont- martre again no no sir protested ben zoof emphatically that is all nonsense it is altogether out of the question to suppose that we are not to see mont- martre again and the orderly shook his head resolutely with the air of a man determined in spite of argument to adhere to his own opinion very good my brave fellow replied servadac hope on hope while you may the message has- come to us over the sea never despair but one thing nevertheless is certain we must forthwith commence arrangements for making this island our permanent home captain servadac now led the way to the gourbi which by his servant's exertions had been entirely rebuilt and here he did the honors of his modest establishment to his two guests the count and the lieutenant and gave a welcome too to little nina who had accompanied them on shore and between whom and ben zoof the most friendly relations had already been established the adjacent building continued in good preserva- tion and captain servadac's satisfaction was very great in finding the two horses zephyr and galette comfortably housed in there and in good condition after the enjoyment of some refreshment the party proceeded to a general consultation as to what steps must be taken for their future welfare the most pressing matter that came before them was the consideration of the means to be adopted to enable the inhabitants of gallia to survive the terri- ble cold which in their ignorance of the true ec- centricity of their orbit might for aught they knew last for an almost indefinite period fuel was far from abundant of coal there was none trees and shrubs were few in number and to cut them down in prospect of the cold seemed a very questionable policy but there was no doubt that some expedient must be devised to prevent disaster and that without delay the victualing of the little colony offered no immediate difficulty water was abundant and the cisterns could hardly fail to be replenished by the numerous streams that meandered along the plains moreover the gallian sea would ere long be frozen over and the melted ice water in its congealed state being divested of every particle of salt would afford a supply of drink that could not be exhausted the crops that were now ready for the harvest and the flocks and herds scattered over the island would form an ample reserve there was little doubt that throughout the winter the soil would remain unpro- ductive and no fresh fodder for domestic animals could then be obtained it would therefore be neces- sary if the exact duration of gallia's year should ever be calculated to proportion the number of animals to be reserved to the real length of the winter the next thing requisite was to arrive at a true estimate of the number of the population without including the thirteen englishmen at gibraltar about whom he was not particularly disposed to give himself much concern at present servadac put down the names of the eight russians the two frenchman and the little italian girl eleven in all as the entire list of the inhabitants of gourbi is- land oh pardon me interposed ben zoof you are mistaking the state of the case altogether you will be surprised to learn that the total of people on the island is double that it is twenty-two twenty-two exclaimed the captain twenty- two people on this island what do you mean the opportunity has not occurred answered ben zoof for me to tell you before but i have had company explain yourself ben zoof said servadac what company have you had you could not suppose replied the orderly that my own unassisted hands could have accom- plished all that harvest work that you see has been done i confess said lieutenant procope we do not seem to have noticed that well then said ben zoof if you will be good enough to come with me for about a mile i shall be able to show you my companions but we must take our guns why take our guns asked servadac i hope we are not going to fight no not with men said ben zoof but it does not answer to throw a chance away for giving battle to those thieves of birds leaving little nina and her goat in the gourbi servadac count timascheff and the lieutenant greatly mystified took up their guns and followed the orderly all along their way they made un- sparing slaughter of the birds that hovered over and around them nearly every species of the feathered tribe seemed to have its representative in that living cloud there were wild ducks in thou- sands snipe larks rooks and swallows a countless variety of sea-birds--widgeons gulls and seamews beside a quantity of game--quails partridges and woodcocks the sportsmen did their best every shot told and the depredators fell by dozens on either hand instead of following the northern shore of the island ben zoof cut obliquely across the plain making their progress with the unwonted rapidity which was attributable to their specific lightness servadac and his companions soon found themselves near a grove of sycamores and eucalyptus massed in picturesque confusion at the base of a little hill here they halted ah the vagabonds the rascals the thieves suddenly exclaimed ben zoof stamping his foot with rage how now are your friends the birds at their pranks again asked the captain no i don't mean the birds i mean those lazy beggars that are shirking their woxk look here off on a comet  look there and as ben zoof spoke he pointed to some scythes and sickles and other implements of husbandry that had been left upon the ground what is it you mean asked servadac getting somewhat impatient hush hush listen was all ben zoof's reply and he raised his finger as if in warning listening attentively servadac and his associates could distinctly recognize a human voice accom- panied by the notes of a guitar and by the measured click of castanets spaniards said servadac no mistake about that sir replied ben zoof a spaniard would rattle his castanets at the can- non's mouth but what is the meaning of it all asked the captain more puzzled than before hark said ben zoof it is the old man's turn and then a voice at once gruff and harsh was heard vociferating my money my money when will you pay me my money pay me what you owe me you miserable majos meanwhile the song continued tu sandunga y cigarro y una cana de jerez mi jamelgo y un trabuco que mas gloria puede haver servadac's knowledge of gascon enabled him partially to comprehend the rollicking tenor of the spanish patriotic air but his attention was again arrested bv the voice of the old man growling sav- agely pay me you shall yes by the god of abra- ham you shall pay me a jew exclaimed servadac ay sir a german jew said ben zoof the party was on the point of entering the thick- et when a singular spectacle made them pause a group of spaniards had just begun dancing their national fandango and the extraordinary lightness which had become the physical property of every object in the new planet made the dancers bound to a height of thirty feet or more into the air con- siderably above the tops of the trees what fol- lowed was irresistibly comic four sturdy majos had dragged along with them an old man incapable of resistance and compelled him nolens volens to join in the dance and as they all kept appearing and disappearing above the bank of foliage their grotesque attitudes combined with the pitiable countenance of their helpless victim could not do otherwise than recall most forcibly the story of sancho panza tossed in a blanket by the merry drapers of segovia servadac the count procope and ben zoof now proceeded to make their way through the thicket until they came to a little glade where two men were stretched idly on the grass one of them play- ing the guitar and the other a pair of castanets both were exploding with laughter as they urged the performers to greater and yet greater exertions in the dance at the sight of strangers- they paused in their music and simultaneously the dancers with their victim alighted gently on the sward breathless and half exhausted as was the jew he rushed with an effort towards servadac and exclaimed in french marked by a strong teutonic accent oh my lord governor help me help these rascals defraud me of my rights they rob me but in the name of the god of israel i ask you to see justice done the captain glanced inquiringly towards ben zoof and the orderly by a significant nod made his master understand that he was to play the part that was implied by the title he took the cue and promptly ordered the jew to hold his tongue at once the man bowed his head in servile submis- sion and folded his hands upon his breast servadac surveyed him leisurely he was a man of about fifty but from his appearance might well have been taken for at least ten years older small and skinny with eyes bright and cunning a hooked nose a short yellow beard unkempt hair huge feet and long bony hands he presented all the typical characteristics of the german jew the heartless wily usurer the hardened miser and skinflint as iron is attracted by the magnet so was this shy- lock attracted by the sight of gold nor would he have hesitated to draw the life-blood of his credi- tors if by such means he could secure his claims his name was isaac hakkabut and he was a na- tive of cologne nearly the whole of his time however he informed captain servadac had been spent upon the sea his real business being that of a merchant trading at all the ports of the med- iterranean a tartan a small vessel of two hundred tons burden conveyed his entire stock of merchan- dise and to say the truth was a sort of floating emporium conveying nearly every possible article of commerce from a lucifer match to the radiant fabrics of frankfort and epinal without wife or children and having no settled home isaac hak- kabut lived almost entirely on board the hansa as he had named his tartan and engaging a mate with a crew of three men as being adequate to work so light a craft he cruised along the coasts of algeria tunis egypt turkey and greece visiting more- over most of the harbors of the levant careful to be always well supplied with the products in most general demand--coffee sugar rice tobacco cotton stuffs and gunpowder--and being at all times ready to barter and prepared to deal in se- condhand wares he had contrived to amass consid- erable wealth on the eventful night of the st of january the ilansa had been at ceuta the point on the coast of morocco exactly opposite gibraltar the mate and three sailors had all gone on shore and in com- mon with mary of their fellow-creatures had en- tirely disappeared but the most projecting rock of ceuta had been undisturbed by the general catastrophe and half a score of spaniards who had happened to be upon it had escaped with their lives they were all andalusian majos agricul- tural laborers and naturally as careless and - apa- thetic as men of their class usually are but they could not help being very considerably embarrassed when they discovered that they were left in soli- tude upon a detached and isolated rock they took what mutual counsel they could but became only more and more perplexed one of them was named negrete and he as having traveled somewhat more than the rest was tacitly recognized as a sort of leader but although he was by far the most en- lightened of them all he was quite incapable of forming the least conception of the nature of what had occurred the one thing upon which they could not fail to be conscious was that they had  amazing stories no prospect of obtaining provisions and consequent- ly their first business was to devise a scheme for getting away from their present abode the hansa was lying off shore the spaniards would not have had the slightest hesitation in summarily taking possession of her but their utter ignorance of sea- manship made them reluctantly come to the conclu- sion that the more prudent policy was to make terms with the owner and now came a singular part of the story negrete and his companions had meanwhile re- ceived a visit from two english officers from gib- raltar what passed between them the jew did not know he only knew that immediately after the con- clusion of the interview negrete came to him and ordered him to set sail at once for the nearest point of morocco the jew afraid to disobey but with his eye ever upon the main chance stipulated that at the end of their voyage the spaniards should pay for their passage--terms to which as they would to any other they did not demur knowing that they had not the slightest intention of giving him a single real the hansa had weighed anchor on the rd of february the wind blew from the west and con- sequently the working of the tartan was easy enough the unpracticed sailors had only tojhoist their sails and though they were quite unconscious of the fact the breeze carried them to the only spot upon the little world they occupied which could af- ford them a refuge thus it fell out that one morning ben zoof from his lookout on gourbi island saw a ship not the dobryna appear upon the horizon and make quiet- ly down towards what had formerly been the right bank of the shelif such was ben zoof's version of what had oc- curred as he had gathered it from the new-comers he wound up his recital by remarking that the cargo of the hansa would be of immense service to them he expected indeed that isaac hakkabut would be difficult to manage but considered there could be no harm in appropriating the goods for the common welfare since there could be no op- portunity now for selling them ben zoof added and as to the difficulties be- tween the jew and his passengers i told him that the governor general was absent on a tour of in- spection and that he would see everything equitably settled smiling at his orderly's tactics servadac turned to hakkabut and told him that he would take care that his claims should be duly investigated and all proper demands should be paid the man appeared satisfied and for the time at least desisted from his complaints and importunities when the jew had retired count timascheff asked but how in the world can you ever make those fellows pay anything they have lots of money said ben zoof not likely replied the count when did you ever know spaniards like them to have lots of money but i have seen it myself said ben zoof and it is english money english money echoed servadac and his mind again reverted to the excursion made by the colonel and the major from gibraltar about which they had been so reticent we must inquire more about this he said then addressing count timascheff he added altogetfc i think the countries of europe are fairly represented by the population of gallia true captain answered the count we have only a fragment of a world but it contains natives of france russia italy spain and england even germany may be said to have a representative in the person of this miserable jew  and even in him said servadac perhaps we shall not find so indifferent a representative as we at present imagine chapter xix gallia's governor general the spaniards who had arrived on board the hansa consisted of nine men and a lad of twelve years of age named pablo they all received cap- tain servadac whom ben zoof introduced as the governor general with due respect and returned quickly to their separate tasks the captain and his friends followed at some distance by the eager jew soon left the glade and directed their steps towards the coast where the hansa was moored as they went they discussed their situation as far as they had ascertained except gourbi island the sole surviving fragments of the old world were four small islands the bit of gibraltar occupied by the englishmen ceuta which had just been left by the spaniards madalena where they had picked up the little italian girl and the site of the tomb of saint louis on the coast of tunis around these there was stretched out the full extent of the gallian sea which apparently comprised about one-half of the mediterranean the whole being encompassed by a barrier like a framework of precipitous cliffs of an origin and a substance alike unknown of all these spots only two were known to be in- habited  gibraltar where the thirteen englishmen were amply provisioned for some years to come and their own gourbi island here there was a population of twenty-two who would all have to subsist upon the natural products of the soil it wa indeed not to be forgotten that perchance upon some remote and undiscovered isle there might be the solitary writer of the mysterious papers which they had found and if so that would raise the census of their new asteroid to an aggregate of thirty-six even upon the supposition that at some future date the whole population should be compelled to unite and find a residence upon gourbi island there did not appear any reason to question but that eight hundred acres of rich soil under good man- agement would yield them all an ample sus- tenance the only critical matter was how long the cold season would last every hope depended upon the land again becoming productive at present it seemed impossible to determine even if gallia's orbit were really elliptical when she would reach her aphelion and it was consequently neces- sary that the gallians for the time being should reckon on nothing beyond their actual and present resources these resources were first the provisions of the dobryna consisting of preserved meat sugar wine off on a comet  brandy and other stores sufficient for about two months secondly the valuable cargo of the hansa which sooner or later the owner whether he would or not must be compelled to surrender for the com- mon benefit and lastly the produce of the island animal and vegetable which with proper economy might be made to last for a considerable period in the course of the conversation count tima- scheff took an opportunity of saying that as cap- tain servadac had already been presented to the spaniards as governor of the island he thought it advisable that he should really assume that position every body of men he observed must have a head and you as a frenchman should i think take the command of this fragment of a french colony my men i can answer for it are quite pre- pared to recognize you as their superior officer most unhesitatingly replied servadac i ac- cept the post with all its responsibilities we un- derstand each other so well that i fell sure we shall try and work together for the common good and even if it be our fate never again to behold our fellow creatures i have no misgivings but that we shall be able to cope with whatever difficulties may be before us as he spoke he held out his hand the count took it at the same time making a slight bow it was the first time since their meeting that the two men had shaken hands on the other hand not a single word about their former rivalry had ever escaped their lips perhaps that was all forgotten now the silence of a few moments was broken by ser- vadac saying do you not think we ought to explain our situation to the spaniards  no no your excellency burst in ben zoof emphatically the fellows are chicken-hearted enough already only tell them what has happened and in sheer despondency they will not do another stroke of work besides said lieutenant procope who took very much the same view as the orderly they are so miserably ignorant they would be sure to mis- understand you understand or misunderstand replied serva- dac i do not think it matters they would not care they are all fatalists only give them a guitar and their castanets and they will soon forget all care and anxiety for my own part i must adhere to my belief that it will be advisable to tell them everything have you any opinion to offer count my own opinion captain coincides entirely with yours i have followed the plan of explaining all i could to my men on board the dobryna and no inconvenience has arisen well then so let it be said the captain adding it is not likely that these spaniards are so ignorant as not to have noticed the change in length of the days neither can they be unaware of the physical changes that have transpired they shall certainly be told that we are being carried away into un- known regions of space and that this island is nearly all that remains of the old world ha ha laughed ben zoof aloud it will be fine sport to watch the old jew's face when he is made to comprehend that he is flying away millions and millions of leagues from all his debtors isaac hakkabut was about fifty yards behind and was consequently unable to overhear the conversa- tion he went shambling along half whimpering and not infrequently invoking the god of israel but every now and then a cunning light gleamed from his eyes and his lips became compressed with a grim significance none of the recent phenomena had escaped his notice and more than once he had attempted to entice ben zoof into conversation upon the subject but the orderly made no secret of hi antipathy to him and generally replied to his advances either by satire or by banter he told him that he had every- thing to gain under the new system of nights and days for instead of living the jew's ordinary life of a century he would reach to the age of two cen- turies  and he congratulated him upon the circum- stance of things having become so light because it would prevent him feeling the burden of his years at another time he would declare that to an old usurer like him it could not matter in the least what had become of the moon as he could not pos- sibly have advanced any money upon her and when isaac undaunted by his jeers persevered in besetting him with questions he tried to silence him by saying only wait till the governor general comes he is a shrewd fellow and will tell you all about it but will he protect my property poor isaac would ask tremulously to be sure he will he would confiscate it all rather than that you should be robbed of it with this job's comfort the jew had been obliged to content himself as best he could and to await the promised arrival of the governor when servadac and his companions reached the shore they found that the hansa had anchored in an exposed bay protected but barely by a few pro- jecting rocks and in such a position that a gale ris- ing from the west would inevitably drive her on to the land where'she must be dashed in pieces it would be the height of folly to leave her in her present moorings without loss of time she must be brought round to the mouth of the shelif in immediate proximity to the russian yacht the consciousness that his tartan was the subject of discussion made the jew give way to such vehe- ment ejaculations of anxiety that servadac turned round and peremptorily ordered him to desist from his clamor leaving the old man under the sur- veillance of the count and ben zoof the captain and the lieutenant stepped into a small boat and were soon alongside the floating emporium a very short inspection sufficed to make them aware that both the tartan and her cargo were in a perfect state of preservation in the hold were sugar-loaves by hundreds chests of tea bags of coffee hogsheads of tobacco pipes of wine casks of brandy barrels of dried herrings bales of cotton clothing of every kind shoes of all sizes caps of various shape tools household utensils china and earthenware reams of paper bottles of ink boxes of lucifer matches blocks of salt bags of pepper and spices a stock of huge dutch cheeses and a col- lection of almanacs and miscellaneous literature at a rough guess the value could not be much under  sterling a new cargo had been taken in only a few days before the catastrophe and it had been isaac hakkabut's intention to cruise from ceuta to tripoli calling wherever he had reason to  amazing stories believe there was likely to be a market for any of his commodities a fine haul lieutenant said the captain yes indeed said the lieutenant but what if the owner refuses to part with it no fear no fear replied the captain as soon as ever the old rascal finds that there are no more arabs or algerians for him to fleece he will be ready enough to transact a little business with us we will pay him by bills of acceptance on some of his old friends in the old world but why should he want any payment inquired the lieutenant under the circumstances he must know that you have a right to make a requisition of his goods no no quickly rejoined servadac we will not do that just because the fellow is a german we shall not be justified in treating him in german fashion we will transact our business in a busi- ness like way only let him once realize that he is on a new globe with no prospect of getting back to the old one and he will be ready enough to come to terms with us perhaps you are right replied the lieutenant i hope you are but anyhow it will not do to leave the tartan here not only would she be in danger in the event of a storm but it is very ques- tionable whether she could resist the pressure of the ice if the water were to freeze quite true procope and accordingly i give you the commission to see that your crew bring her round to the shelif as soon as may be to-morrow morning it shall be done answered the lieutenant promptly upon returning to the shore it was arranged that the whole of the little colony should forthwith- assemble at the gourbi the spaniards were sum- moned and isaac although he could only with re- luctance take his wistful gaze from his tartan obeyed the governor's orders to follow an hour later and the entire population of twenty-two had met in the chamber adjoining the gourbi young pablo made his first acquaintance with little nina and the child seemed highly de- lighted to find a companion so nearly of her own age leaving the children to entertain each other cap- tain servadac began his address before entering upon further explanation he said that he counted upon the cordial co-operation of them all for the common welfare negrete interrupted him by declaring that no promises or pledges could be given until he and his countrymen knew how soon they could be sent back to spain to spain do you say asked servadac to spain echoed isaac hakkabut with a hide- ous yell do they expect to go back to spain till they have paid their debts your excellency they owe me twenty reals apiece for their passage here they owe me two hundred reals are they to be allowed     silence mordecai you fool shouted ben zoof who was accustomed to call the jew by any hebrew name that came uppermost to his memory silence servadac was disposed to appease the old man's anxiety by promising to see that justice was ulti- mately done but in a fever of frantic excitement he went on to implore that he might have the loan of a few sailors to carry his ship to algiers i will pay you honestly i will pay you well he cried but his ingrained propensity for making a good bargain prompted him to add provided you do not overcharge me ben zoof was about again to interpose some angry exclamation but servadac checked him and continued in spanish listen to me my friends something very strange has happened a moat wonderful event has cut us off from spain from france from italy from every country of europe in fact we have left the old world entirely of the whole earth nothing remains except this island on which you are now taking refuge the old globe is far far away our present abode is but an insig- nificant fragment that is left i dare not tell you that there is any chance of your ever again seeing your country or your homes he paused the spaniards evidently had no con- ception of his meaning negrete begged him to tell them all again he repeated all that he had said and by introducing some illustrations from familiar things he suc- ceeded to a certain extent in conveying some faint idea of the convulsion that had happened the event was precisely what he had foretold the communication was received by all alike with the most supreme indifference hakkabut did not say a word he had listened with manifest attention his lips twitching now and then as if suppressing a smile servadac turned to him and asked whether he was still disposed to put out to sea and make for algiers the jew gave a broad grin which however he was careful to conceal from the spaniards your excellency jests he said in french and turning to count timascheff he added in russian the governor has made up a wonderful tale the count turned his back in disgust while the jew sidled up to little nina and muttered in italian a lot of lies pretty one a lot of lies confound the knave exclaimed ben zoof he gabbles every tongue under the sun yes said servadac but whether he speaks french russian spanish german or italian he is neither more nor less than a jew chapter xx a light on the horizon on the following day without giving himself any further concern about the jew's incredulity the captain gave orders for the hansa to be shifted round to the harbor of the shelif hakkabut raised no objection not only because he was aware that the move insured the immediate safety of his tar- tan but because he was secretly entertaining the hope that he might entice away two or three of the dobryna's crew and make his escape to algiers or some other port operations now commenced for preparing proper winter quarters spaniards and russians alike joined heartily in the work the diminution of at- mospheric pressure and of the force of attraction contributing such an increase to their muscular force as materially facilitated all their labors the first business was to accommodate the build- ing adjacent to the gourbi to the wants of the little colony here for the present the spaniards were off on a comet  lodged the russians retaining their berths upon the yacht while the jew was permitted to pass his nights upon the hansa this arrangement how- ever could be only temporary the time could not be far distant when ships sides and ordinary walls would fail to give an adequate protection from the severity of the cold that must be expected the stock of fuel was too limited to keep up a permanent supply of heat in their present quarters and conse- quently they must be driven to seek some other refuge the internal temperature of which would at least be bearable  the plan that seemed to commend itself most to their consideration was that they should dig out for themselves some subterraneous pits similar to silos such as are used as receptacles for grain they presumed that when the surface of gallia should be covered by a thick layer of ice which is a bad conductor of heat a sufficient amount of warmth for animal vitality might still be retained in excavations of this kind after a long consulta- tion they failed to devise any better expedient and were forced to resign themselves to this species of troglodyte existence in one respect they congratulated themselves that they should be better off than many of the whalers in the polar seas for as it is impossible to get below the surface of a frozen ocean these adventurers have to seek refuge in huts of wood and snow erected on their ships which at best can give but slight protection from extreme cold but here with a solid subsoil the gallians might hope to dig down a hundred feet or so and secure for themselves a shelter that would enable them to brave the hardest severity of climate the order then was at once given the work was commenced a stock of shovels mattocks and pick- axes was brought from the gourbi and with ben zoof as overseer both spanish majos and russian sailors set to work with a will it was not long however before a discovery more unexpected than agreeable suddenly arrested their labors the spot chosen for the excavation was a little to the right of the gourbi on a slight eleva- tion of the soil for the first day everything went on prosperously enough but at a depth of eight feet below the surface the navvies came in contact with a hard surface upon which all their tools failed to make the slightest impression servadac and the count were at once apprised of the fact and had little difficulty in recognizing the substance that had revealed itself as the very same which composed the shores as well as the subsoil of the gallian sea it evidently formed the universal substructure of the new asteroid means for hollowing it failed them utterly harder and more resisting than granite it could not be blasted by ordinary powder dyna- mite alone could suffice to rend it the disappointment was very great unless some means of protection were speedily devised death seemed to be staring them in the face were the figures in the mysterious documents correct if so gallia must now be a hundred millions of leagues from the sun nearly three times the distance of the earth at the remotest section of her orbit the intensity of the solar light and heat too was very seriously diminishing although gourbi island be- ing on the equator of an orb which had its axis always perpendicular to the plane in which it re- volved enjoyed a position that gave it a permanent summer but no advantage of this kind could com- pensate for the remoteness of the sun the tem- perature fell steadily already to the discomfiture of the little italian girl nurtured in sunshine ice was beginning to form in the crevices of the rocks and manifestly the time was impending when the sea itself would freeze some shelter must be found before the tempera- ture should fall to  below zero otherwise death was inevitable hitherto for the last few days the thermometer had been registering an average of about  below zero and it had become matter of experience that the stove although replenished with all the wood that was available was altogether in- adequate to effect any sensible mitigation of the severity of the cold nor could any amount of fuel be enough it was certain that ere long the very mercury and spirit in the thermometers would be congealed some other resort must assuredly be soon found or they must perish that was clear the idea of betaking themselves to the dobryna and hansa could not for a moment be seriously en- tertained not only did the structure of the vessels make them utterly insufficient to give substantial sheltex- but they were totally unfitted to be trusted as to their stability when exposed to the enormous pressure of the accummulated ice neither sex'vadac nor the count nor lieutenant procope were men to be easily dislxeartened but it could not be concealed that they felt themselves in circumstances by which they were equally harassed and perplexed the sole expedient that their united counsel could suggest was to obtain a x'efuge below ground and that was denied them by the strange and impenetrable substratum of the soil yet hour by hour the sun's disc was lessening in its dimen- sions and although at midday some faint radiance and glow were to be distinguished during the night the painfulness of the cold was becoming almost intolerable mounted upon zephyr and galette the captain and the count scoured the island in search of some available retreat scarcely a yard of ground was left unexplored the horses clearing every obstacle as if they were like pegasus furnished with wings but all in vain soundings wexe made again and again but invariably with the same result the rock hard as adamant never failed to reveal itself within a few feet of the surface of the ground the excavation of any silo being thus manifestly hopeless there seemed nothing to be done except to try and render the buildings alongside the gourbi impervious to frost to contribute to the supply of fuel orders were given to collect every scrap of wood dry or green that the island produced and this involved the necessity of felling the numerous trees that were scattered over the plain but toil as they might at the accumulation of firewood cap- tain servadac and his companions could not resist the conviction that the consumption of a very short period would exhaust the total stock and what would happen then studious if possible to conceal his real misgiv- ings and anxious that the rest of the party should be affected as little as might be by his own un- easiness servadac would wander alone about the island racking his brain for an idea that would  amazing stories point the way out of the serious difficulty but still all in vain one day he suddenly came upon ben zoof and asked him whether he had no plan to propose the orderly shook his head but after a few moments pondering said ah master if only we were at montmartre we would get shelter in the charming stone-quarries idiot replied the captain angrily if we were at montmartre you don't suppose that we should need to live in stone-quarries but the means of preservation which human in- genuity had failed to secure were at hand from the felicitous provision of nature herself it was on the th of march that the captain and lieutenant procope started off once more to investigate the northwest corner of the island on their way their conversation naturally was engrossed by the subject of the dire necessities which only too manifestly were awaiting them a discussion more than usu- ally animated arose between them for the two men were not altogether of the same mind as to the measures that ought to be adopted in order to open the fairest chance of avoiding a fatal climax to their exposure the captain persisted that an en- tirely new abode must be sought while the lieu- tenant was equally bent upon devising a method of some sort by which their present quarters might be rendered sufficiently warm all at once in the very heat of his argument procope paused he passed his hand across his eyes as if to dispel a mist and stood with a fixed gaze centered on a point towards the south what is that he said with a kind of hesitation no i am not mistaken he added it is a light on the horizon a light exclaimed servadac show me where look there answered the lieutenant and he kept pointing steadily in its direction until ser- vadac also distinctly saw the bright speck in the distance it increased in clearness in the gathering shades of evening can it be a ship asked the captain if so it must be in flames otherwise we should not be able to see it so far off replied procope it does not move said servadac and unless i am greatly deceived i can hear a kind of rever- beration in the air for some seconds the two men stood straining eyes and ears in rapt attention suddenly an idea struck servadac's mind the volcano he cried may it not be the volcano that we saw whilst we were on board the dobryna the lieutenant agreed that it was very probable heaven be praised ejaculated the captain and he went on in the tones of a keen excitement na- ture has provided us with our winter quarters the stream of burning lava that is flowing there is the gift of a bounteous providence it will provide us all the warmth we need no time to lose to- morrow my dear procope to-morrow we will ex- plore it all no doubt the life the heat we want is reserved for us in the heart and bowels of our own gallia whilst the captain was indulging in his expres- sions of enthusiasm procope was endeavoring to collect his thoughts distinctly he remembered the long promontory which had barred the dobryna's progress while coasting the southern confines of the sea and which had obliged her to ascend north- wards as far as the former latitude of oran he remembered also that at the extremity of the pro- montory there was a rocky headland crowned with smoke and now he was convinced that he was right in identifying the position and in believing that the smoke had given place to an eruption of flame when servadac gave him a chance of speaking he said the more i consider it captain the more i am satisfied that your conjecture is correct be- yond a doubt what we see is the volcano and to- morrow we will not fail to visit it on returning to the gourbi they communicated their discovery to count timascheff only deeming any further publication of it to be premature the count at once placed his yacht at their disposal and expressed his intention of accompanying-them the yacht i think said procope had better remain where she is the weather is beautifully calm and the steam-launch will answer our purpose better at any rate it will convey us much closer to shore than the schooner the count replied that the lieutenant was by all means to use his own discretion and they all retired for the night like many other modern pleasure-yachts the dobryna in addition to her four-oar was fitted with a fast-going little steam-launch its screw being pro- pelled on the oriolle system by mean of a boiler small but very effective early next morning this handy little craft was sufficiently freighted with coal of which there was still about ten tons on board the dobryna and manned by nobody except the captain the count and the lieutenant left the harbor of the shelif much to the bewilderment of ben zoof who had not yet been admitted into the secret the orderly however consoled himself with the reflection that he had been temporarily invested with the full powers of governor general an office of which he was not a little proud the eighteen miles between the island and the headland were made in something less than three hours the volcanic eruption was manifestly very considerable the entire summit of the promontory being enveloped in flames to produce so large a combustion either the oxygen of gallia's atmosphere had been brought into contact with the explosive gases contained beneath her soil or perhaps still more probable the volcano like those in the moon was fed by an internal supply of oxygen of her own it took more than half an hour to settle on a suitable landing-place at length a small semi- circular creek was discovered among the rocks which appeared advantageous because if circum- stances should so require it would form a safe an- chorage for both the dobryna and the hansa the launch securely moored the passengers landed on the side of the promontory opposite to that on which a torrent of flaming lava was de- scending to the sea with much satisfaction they experienced as they approached the mountain a sensible difference in the temperature and their spirits could not do otherwise than rise at the pros- pect of having their hopes confirmed that a deliv- erance from the threatened calamity had so oppor- tunely been found on they went up the steep acclivity scrambling over its rugged projections scaling the irregularities of its gigantic strata bounding from point to point with the agility of chamois but never alighting on anything except off on a comet  the accumulation of the same hexagonal prisms with which they had now become so familiar their exertions were happily rewarded behind a huge pyramid rock they found a hole in the mountain-side like the mouth of a great tunnel climbing up to this orifice which was more than sixty feet above the level of the sea they ascertained that it opened into a long dark gallery they entered and groped their way cautiously along the sides a continuous rumbling that increased as they ad- vanced made them aware that they must be ap- proaching the central funnel of the volcano their only fear was lest some insuperable wall of rock should suddenly bar their further progress servadac was some distance ahead come on he cried cheerily his voice ringing through the darkness come on our fire is lighted no stint of fuel nature provides that let us make haste and warm ourselves inspired by his confidence the count and the lieu- tenant advanced bravely along the unseen and wind- ing path the temperature was now at least fifteen degrees above zero and the walls of the gallery were beginning to feel quite warm to the touch an indi- cation not to be overlooked that the substance of which the rock was composed was metallic in its nature and capable of conducting heat follow me shouted servadac again we shall soon find a regular stove onwards they made their way until at last a sharp turn brought them into a sudden flood of light the tunnel had opened into a vast cavern and the gloom was exchanged for an illumination that was perfectly dazzling although the tem- perature was high it was not in any way intoler- able one glance was sufficient to satisfy the explorers that the grateful light and heat of this huge excava- tion were to be attributed to a torrent of lava that was rolling downwards to the sea completely sub- tending the aperture of the cave not inaptly might the scene be compared to the celebrated grotto of the winds at the rear of the central fall of niagara only with the exception that here instead of a cur- tain of rushing water it was a curtain of roaring flame that hung before the cavern's mouth heaven be praised cried servadac with glad emotion here is all that we hoped for and more besides chapter xxi winter quarters the habitation that had now revealed itself well lighted and thoroughly warm was indeed marvel- ous not only would it afford ample accommodation for hector servadac and his subjects as ben zoof delighted to call them but it would provide shelter for the two horses and for a considerable number of domestic animals this enormous cavern was neither more or less than the common junction of nearly twenty tunnels similar to that which had been traversed by the explorers forming ramifications in the solid rock and the pores as it were by which the internal heat exuded from the heart of the mountain here as long as the volcano retained its activity every iving creature on the new asteroid might brave the most rigorous of climates and as count timascheff justly remarked since it was the only burning moun- tain they had sighted it was most probably the sole outlet for gallia's subterranean fires and conse- quently the eruption might continue unchanged for ages to come but not a day not an hour was to be lost now the steam-launch returned to gourbi island and preparations were forthwith taken in hand for con- veying man and beast corn and fodder across to the volcanic headland loud and hearty were the accla- mations of the little colony especially of the spaniards and great was the relief of nina when servadac announced to them the discovery of their future domicile and with requickened energies they labored hard at packing anxious to reach their genial winter quarters without delay for three successive days the dobryna laden to her very gunwale made a transit to and fro ben zoof was left upon the island to superintend the stowage of the freight whilst servadac found abun- dant occupation in overlooking its disposal within the recesses of the mountain first of all the large store of corn and fodder the produce of the recent harvest was landed and deposited in one of the vaults then on the th about fifty head of live cattle--bullocks cows sheep and pigs--were con- veyed to their rocky stalls these were saved for the sake of preserving the several breeds the bulk of the island cattle being slaughtered as the ex- treme severity of the climate insured all meat re- maining fresh for almost an indefinite period the winter which they were expecting would probably be of unprecedented length it was quite likely that it would exceed the six months duration by which many arctic explorers have been tried but the popu- lation of gallia had no anxiety in the matter of provisions--their stock was far more than ade- quate  while as for drink as long as they were satis- fied with pure water a frozen sea would afford them an inexhaustible reservoir the need for haste in forwarding their prepara- tions became more and more manifest the sea threatened to be unnavigable very soon as ice was already forming which the noonday sun was unable to melt and if haste were necessary so also were care ingenuity and forethought it was indis- pensable that the space at their command should be properly utilized and yet that the several portions of the store should all be readily accessible on further investigation an unexpected number of galleries was discovered so that in fact the interior of the mountain was like a vast bee-hive perforated with innumerable cells and in compli- ment to the little italian it was unanimously voted by the colony that their new home should be called nina's hive the first care of captain servadac was to ascer- tain how he could make the best possible use of the heat which nature had provided for them so opportunely and with so lavish a hand by opening fresh vents in the solid rock which by the action of the heat was here capable of fissure the stream of burning lava was diverted into several new chan- nels where it could be available for daily use and thus mochel the dobryna's cook was furnished with an admirable kitchen provided with a perman- ent stove where he was duly installed with all his culinary apparatus what a saving of expense it would be ex-  amazing stories claimed ben zoof if every household could be furnished with its own private volcano the large cavern at the general junction of the galleries was fitted up as a drawing-room and ar- ranged with all the best furniture both of the gourbi and of the cabin of the dobryna hither was also brought the shooner's library containing a good variety of french and russian books lamps were suspended over the different tables and the walls of the apartment were tapestried with the sails and adorned with the flags belonging to the yacht the curtain of fire extending over the opening of the cavern provided it as already stated with light and heat the torrent of lava fell into a small rock-bound basin that had no apparent communication with the sea and was evidently the aperture of a deep abyss of which the waters heated by the descent of the eruptive matter would no doubt retain their liquid condition long after the gallian sea had be- come a sheet of ice a small excavation to the left of the common hall was allotted for the special use of servadac and the count another on the right was appropriated to the lieutenant and ben zoof whilst a third recess im- mediately at the back made a convenient little chamber for nina the spaniards and the russian sailors took up their sleeping-quarters in the ad- jacent galleries and found the temperature quite comfortable such were the internal arrangements of nina's hive the refuge where the little colony were full of hope that they would be able to brave the rigors of the stern winter-time that lay before them--a winter-time during which gallia might possibly be projected even to the orbit of jupiter where the temperature would not exceed one twenty-fifth of the normal winter temperature of the earth the only discontented spirit was isaac hakka- but throughout all the preparations which roused even the spaniards to activity the jew still in- credulous and deaf to every representation of the true state of things insisted upon remaining in the creek at gourbi island nothing could induce him to leave his tartan where like a miser he would keep guard over his precious cargo ever grumbling and growling but with his weather-eye open in the hope of catching sight of some passing sail it must be owned that the whole party were far from sorry to be relieved of his presence his uncomely figure and repulsive countenance was a perpetual bugbear he had given out in plain terms that he did not intend to part with any of his property except for current money and servadac equally resolute had strictly forbidden any pur- chases to be made hoping to wear out the rascal's obstinacy hakkabut persistently refused to credit the real situation he could not absolutely deny that some portions of the terrestrial globe had undei'gone a certain degree of modification but nothing could bring him to believe that he was not sooner or later to resume his old line of business in the med- iterranean with his wonted distrust of all with whom he came in contact he regarded every argu- ment that was urged upon him only as evidence of a plot that had been devised to deprive him of his goods repudiating as he did utterly the hypo- thesis that a fragment had beome detached from the earth he scanned the horizon for hours to- gether with an old telescope the case of which had been patched up till it looked like a rusty stove-pipe hoping to descry the passing trader with which he might effect some bartering jpon advantageous terms at first he professed to regard the proposed re- moval into winter-quarters as an attempt to impose upon his credulity but the frequent voyages made by the dobryna to the south and the repeated con- signments of corn and cattle soon served to make him aware that captain servadac and his compan- ions were really contemplating a departure from gourbi island the movement set him thinking what he be- gan to ask himself--what if all that was told him was true what if this sea was no longer the mediterranean what if he should never again behold his german fatherland what if his marts for business were gone for ever a vague idea of ruin began to take possession of his mind he must yield to necessity he must do the best he could as the result of his cogitations he occa- sionally left his tartan and made a visit to the shore at length he endeavored to mingle with the busy group who were hurrying on their prep- arations but his advances were only met by jeers and scorn and ridiculed by all the rest he was fain to turn his attention to ben zoof to whom he of- fered a few pinches of tobacco no old zebulon said ben zoof steadily re- fusing tne gift it is against orders to take any- thing from you keep your cargo to yourself eat and drink it all if you can we are not to touch it finding the subordinates incorruptible isaac de- termined to go to the fountain-head he addressed himself to servadac and begged him to tell him the whole truth piteously adding that surely it was unworthy of a french officer to deceive a poor old man like himself tell you the truth man cried servadac con- found it i have told you the truth twenty times once for all i tell you now you have left yourself barely time enough to make your escape to yonder mountain god and mahomet have mercy on me muttered the jew whose creed frequently assumed a very ambiguous character i will tell you what continued the captain-- you shall have a few men to work the hansa across if you like but i want to go to algiers whispered hak- kabut how often am i to tell you that algiers is no longer in existence  only say yes or no--are you coming with us into winter-quarters god of israel what is to become of all my property but mind you continued the captain not heed- ing the interruption if you do not choose volun- tarily to come with us i shall have the hansa by my orders removed to a place of safety i am not going to let your cursed obstinancy incur the risk of losing your cargo altogether merciful heaven i shall be ruined moaned isaac in despair you are going the right way to ruin yourself and it would serve you right to leave you to your own devices but be off i have no more to say off on a comet  and turning contemptuously on his heel ser- vadac left the old man vociferating bitterly and with uplifted hands protesting vehemently against the rapacity of the gentiles by the th all preliminary arrangements were complete and everything ready for a final departure from the island the thermometer stood on an average at  below zero and the water in the cis- tern was completely frozen it was determined therefore for the colony to embark on the following day and take up their residence in nina's hive a final consultation was held about the hansa lieutenant procope pronounced his decided convic- tion that it would be impossible for the tartan to resist the pressure of the ice in the harbor of the shelif and that there would be far more safety in the proximity of the volcano it was agreed on all hands that the vessel must be shifted and ac- cordingly orders were given four russian sailors were sent on board and only a few minutes elapsed after the dobryna had weighed anchor before the great lateen sail of the tartan was unfurled and the shop-ship as ben zoof delighted to call it was also on her way to the southward long and loud were the lamentations of the jew he kept exclaiming that he had given no orders that he was being moved against his will that he had asked for no assistance and needed none but it required no very keen discrimination to observe that all along there was a lurking gleam of satis- faction in his little gray eyes and when a few hours later he found himself securely anchored and his property in a place of safety he quite chuckled with glee god of israel he said in an undertone they have made'no charge the idiots have piloted me here for nothing for nothing his whole nature exulted in the consciousness that he was enjoying a service that had been rendered gratuitously destitute of human inhabitants gourbi island was now left to the tenancy of such birds and beasts as had escaped the recent promiscuous slaughter birds indeed that had migrated in search of warmer shores had returned proving that this fragment of the french colony was the only shred of land that could yield them any sus- tenance but their life must necessarily be short it was utterly impossible that they could survive the cold that would soon ensue the colony took possession of their new abode with but few formalities everyone however ap- proved of all the internal arrangements of nina's hive and were profuse in their expressions of satisfaction at finding themselves located in such comfortable quarters the only malcontent was hakkabut he had no share in the general enthusi- asm refused even to enter or inspect any of the galleries and insisted on remaining on board his tartan he is afraid said ben zoof that he will have to pay for his lodgings but wait a bit we shall see how he stands the cold out there the frost no doubt will drive the old fox out of his hole towards evening the pots were set boiling and a bountiful supper to which all were invited was spread in the central hall the stores of the dob- ryna contained some excellent wine some of which was broached to do honor to the occasion the health of the governor general was drunk as well as the toast success to his council to which ben zoof was called upon to return thanks the enter- tainment passed off merrily the spaniards were in the best of spirits one of them played the guitar another the castanets and the rest joined in a ring- ing chorus ben zoof contributed the famous zouave refrain well known throughout the french army but rarely performed in finer style than by this virtuoso misti goth dar dar tire lyre flic floe flac lirette lira far la rira tour tala rire tour la riband ricandeau sans re-pos repit repit repos ris pot ripette si vous attrapez mon refrain fameux vous etes the concert was succeeded by a ball unquestion- ably the first that had ever taken place in gallia the russian sailors exhibited some of their na- tional dances which gained considerable applause even though they followed upon the marvelous fandangos of the spaniards ben zoof in his turn danced a pas seul often performed in the elysee montmartre with an elegance and vigor that earned many compliments from negrete it was nine o'clock before the festivities came to an end and by that time the company heated by the high temperature of the hall and by their own exertions felt the want of a little fresh air ac- cordingly the greater portion of the party escorted by ben zoof made their way into one of the ad- jacent galleries that led to the shore servadac with the count and lieutenant did not follow im- mediately  but shortly afterwards they proceeded to join them when on their way they were startled by loud cries from those in advance their first impression was that they were cries of distress and they were greatly relieved to find that they were shouts of delight which the dryness and purity of the atmosphere caused to re-echo like a volley of musketry reaching the mouth of the gallery they found the entire group pointing with eager interest to the sky well ben zoof asked the captain what's the matter now oh your excellency ejaculated the orderly look there look there the moon the moon's come back and sure enough what was apparently the moon was rising above the mists of evening chapter xxii a frozen ocean the moon she had disappeared for weeks was she now returning had she been faithless to the earth and had she now approached to be a satellite of the new-born world  impossible said lieutenant procope the earth is millions and millions of leagues away and it is not probable that the moon has ceased to re- volve about her why not remonstrated servadac it would not be more strange than the other phenomena which we have lately witnessed why should not  amazing stories the moon have fallen within the limits of gallia's attraction and become her satellite upon that supposition put in the count i should think that it would be altogether unlikely that three months would elapse without our seeing her quite incredible continued procope and there is another thing which totally disproves the captain's hypothesis the magnitude of gallia is far too insignificant for her power of attraction to carry off the moon but persisted servadac why should not the same convulsion that tore us away from the earth have torn away the moon as well after wander- ing about as she would for a while in the solar regions i do not see why she should not have at- tached herself to us the lieutenant repeated his conviction that it was not likely but why not again asked servadac impetu- ously because i tell you the mass of gallia is so inferior to that of the moon that gallia would be- come the moon's satellite the moon could not possi- bly become hers assuming however continued servadac such to be the case- i am afraid said the lieutenant interrupting him that i cannot assume anything of the sort even for a moment servadac smiled good-humoredly i confess you seem to have the best of the argu- ment and if gallia had become a satellite of the moon it would not have taken three months to catch sight of her i suppose you are right while this discussion had been going on the satellite or whatever it might be had been rising steadily above the horizon and had reached a posi- tion favorable for observation telescopes were brought and it was very soon ascertained beyond a question that the new luminary was not the well- known phcebe of terrestrial nights it had no fea- ture in common with the moon although it was apparently much nearer to gallia than the moon to the earth its superficies was hardly one-tenth as large and so feebly did it reflect the light of the remote sun that it scarcely emitted radiance enough to extinguish the dim luster of stars of the eighth magnitude like the sun it had risen in the west and was now at its full to confuse its identity with the moon was absolutely impossible not even servadac could discover a trace of the seas chasms craters and mountains which have been so minutely delineated in lunar charts and it could not be de- nied that any transient hope that had been excited as to their once again being about to enjoy the peaceful smiles of the queen of night must all be given up count timascheff finally suggested though some- what doubtfully the question of the probability that gallia in her course across the zone of the minor planets had carried off one of them but whether it was one of the  asteroids already included in the astronomical catalogues or one previously unknown he did not presume to determine the idea to a certain extent was plausible inasmuch as it has been ascertained that several of the telescopic planets are of such small dimensions that a good walker might make a circuit of them in four and twenty hours consequently gallia being of superi- or volume might be supposed capable of exercising a power of attraction upon any of these miniature microcosms the first night in nina's hive passed without special incident and next morning a regular scheme of life was definitely laid down my lord gov- ernor as ben zoof until he was peremptorily for- bidden delighted to call servadac had a wholesome dread of idleness and its consequences and insisted upon each member of the party undertaking some special duty to fulfill there was plenty to do the domestic animals required a great deal of attention a supply of food had to be secured and preserved fishing had to be carried on while the condition of the sea would allow it and in several places the galleries had to be further excavated to render them more available for use occupation then need never be wanting and the daily round of labor could go on in orderly routine a perfect concord ruled the little colony the russians and spaniards amalgamated well and both did their best to pick up various scraps of french which was considered the official language of the place servadac himself undertook the tuition of pablo and nina ben zoof being their companion in play-hours when he entertained them with en- chanting stories in the best parisian french about a lovely city at the foot of a mountain where he always promised one day to take them the end of march came but the cold was not intense to such a degree as to confine any of the party to the interior of their resort several excur- sions were made along the shore and for a radius of three or four miles the adjacent district was carefully explored investigation however always ended in the same result turn their course in what- ever direction they would they found that the country retained everywhere its desert character rocky barren and without a trace of vegetation here and there a slight layer of snow or a thin coating of ice arising from atmospheric condensa- tion indicated the existence of superficial moisture but it would require a period indefinitely long ex- ceeding human reckoning before that moisture could collect into a stream and roll downwards over the stony strata to the sea it seemed at present out of their power to determine whether the land upon which they were so happily settled was an island or a continent and till the cold was abated they feared to undertake any lengthened expedition to ascertain the actual extent of the strange con- crete of metallic crystallization by ascending one day to the summit of the vol- cano captain servadac and the count succeeded in getting a general idea of the aspect of the country the mountain itself was an enormous block rising symmetrically to a height of nearly  feet above the level of the sea in the form of a truncated cone of which the topmost section was crowned by a wreath of smoke issuing continuously from the mouth of a narrow crater under the old condition of terrestrial things the ascent of this steep acclivity would have been at- tended with much fatigue but as the effect of the altered condition of the law of gravity the travelers performed perpetual prodigies in the way of agility and in little over an hour reached the edge of the crater without more sense of exertion than if they off on a comet  had traversed a couple of miles on level ground gallia had its drawbacks but it had some com- pensating advantages telescopes in hand the explorers from the sum- mit scanned the surrounding view their anticipa- tions had already realized what they saw just as they expected on the north east and west lay the gallian sea smoothed and motionless as a sheet of glass the cold having as it were congealed the atmosphere so that there was not a breath of wind towards the south there seemed no limit to the land and the volcano formed the apex of a triangle of which the base was beyond the reach of vision viewed even from this height whence distance would do much to soften the general asperity the surface nevertheless seemed to be bristling with its myriads of hexagonal lamellse and to present diffi- culties which to an ordinary pedestrian would be insurmountable oh for some wings or else a balloon cried servadac as he gazed around him and then look- ing down to the rock upon which they were stand- ing he added we seem to have been transplanted to a soil strange enough in its chemical character to bewilder the savants of a museum and do you observe captain asked the count how the convexity of our little world curtails our view see how circumscribed is the horizon servadac replied that he had noticed the same circumstance from the top of the cliffs of gourbi island yes said the count it becomes more and more obvious that ours is a very tiny world and that gourbi island is the sole productive spot upon its surface we have had a short summer and who knows whether we are not entering upon a winter that may last for years perhaps for cen- turies but we must not mind count said servadac smiling we have agreed you know that come what may we are to be philosophers ay true my friend rejoined the count we must be philosophers and something more we must be grateful to the good protector who has hitherto befriended us and we must trust his mercy to the end for a few moments they both stood in silence and contemplated land and sea then having given a last glance over the dreary panorama they pre- pared to wend their way down the mountain be- fore they commenced their descent however they resolved to make a closer examination of the crater they were particularly struck by what seemed to them almost the mysterious calmness with which the eruption was effected there was none of the wild disorder and deafening tumult that usually accompany the discharge of volcanic matter but the heated lava rising with a uniform gentleness quietly overran the limits of the crater like the flow of water from the bosom of a peaceful lake instead of a boiler exposed to the action of an angry fire the crater rather resembled a brimming basin of which the contents were noiselessly escaping nor were there any igneous stones or red-hot cin- ders mingled with the smoke that crowned the sum- mit a circumstance that quite accorded wjth the absence of the pumice-stones obsidians and other minerals of volcanic origin with which the base of a burning mountain is generally strewn captain servadac was of opinion that this pecu- liarity augured favorably for the continuance of the eruption extreme violence in physical as well as in moral nature is never of long duration the most terrible storms like the most violent fits of passion are not lasting but here the calm flow of the liquid fire appeared to be supplied from a source that was inexhaustible in the same way as the waters of niagara gliding on steadily to their final plunge would defy all effort to arrest their course before the evening of this day closed in a most important change was effected in the condition of the gallian sea by the intervention of human agency notwithstanding the increasing cold the sea unruffled as it was by a breath of wind still retained its liquid state it is an established fact that water under this condition of absolute still- ness will remain uncongealed at a temperature several degrees below zero whilst experiment at the same time shows that a very slight shock will often be sufficient to convert it into solid ice it had occurred to servadac that if some com- munication could be opened with gourbi island there would be a fine scope for hunting expeditions having this ultimate object in view he assembled his little colony upon a projecting rock at the ex- tremity of the promontory and having called nina and pablo out to him in front he said now nina do you think you could throw something into the sea i think i could replied the child but i am sure that pablo would throw it a great deal further than i can never mind you shall try first putting a fragment of ice into nina's hand he addressed himself to pablo look out pablo you shall see what a nice little fairy nina is throw nina throw as hard as you can nina balanced the pie of ice two or three times in her hand and threw it forward with all her strength a sudden thrill seemed to vibrate across the mo- tionless waters to the distant horizon and the gal- lian sea had become a solid sheet of ice chapter xxiii a carrier-pigeon when three hours after sunset on the rd of march the gallian moon rose upon the western horizon it was observed that she had entered upon her last quarter she had taken only four days to pass from syzygy to quadrature and it was conse- quently evident that she would be visible for little more than a week at a time and that her lunation would be accomplished within sixteen days the lunar months like the solar days had been dimin- ished by one-half three days later the moon was in conjunction with the sun and was consequently lost to view ben zoof as the first observer of the satellite was extremely interested in its movements and wondered whether it would ever reappear on the th under an atmosphere perfectly clear and dry the thermometer fell to  c below zero of the present distance of gallia from the sun and the number of leagues she had traversed since the receipt of the last mysterious document there were  amazing stories no means of judging the extent of diminution in the apparent disc of the sun did not afford sufficient basis even for an approximate calculation and captain servadac was perpetually regretting that they could receive no further tidings from the an- onymous correspondent whom he persisted in re- garding as a fellow-countryman the solidity of the ice was perfect the utter stillness of the air at the time when the final con- gelation of the waters had taken place had resulted in the formation of a surface that for smoothness would rival a skating-rink without a crack or flaw it extended far beyond the range of vision the contrast to the ordinary aspect of polar seas was very remarkable there the ice-fields are an agglomeration of hummocks and icebergs massed in wild confusion often towering higher than the masts of the largest whalers and from the instabil- ity of their foundations liable to an instantaneous loss of equilibrium a breath of wind a slight modi- fication of the temperature not infrequently serv- ing to bring about a series of changes outrivaling the most elaborate transformation scenes of a pan- tomime here on the contrary the vast white plain was level as the desert of sahara or the rus- sian steppes the waters of the gallian sea were imprisoned beneath the solid sheet which became continually thicker in the increasing cold accustomed to the uneven crystallizations of their own frozen seas the russians could not be other- wise than delighted with the polished surface that afforded them such excellent opportunity for en- joying their favorite pastime of skating a supply of skates found hidden away amongst the dob- ryna's stores was speedily brought into use the russians undertook the instruction of the span- iards and at the end of a few days during which the temperature was only endurable through the absence of wind there was not a gallian who could not skate tolerably well while many of them could describe figures involving the most complicated curves nina and pablo earned loud applause by their rapid proficiency captain servadac an adept in athletics almost outvied his instructor the count and ben zoof who had upon some rare occa- sions skated upon the lake pi montmartre in his eyes of course a sea performed prodigies in the art this exercise was not only healthful in itself but it was acknowledged that in case of necessity it might become a very useful means of locomotion as captain servadac remarked it was almost a substitute for railways and as if to illustrate this proposition lieutenant procope perhaps the great- est expert in the party accomplished the twenty miles to gourbi island and back in considerably less than four hours the temperature meanwhile continued to de- crease and the average reading of the thermometer was about  c below zero the light also dimin- ished in proportion and all objects appeared to be enveloped in a half-defined shadow as though the sun were undergoing a perpetual eclipse it was not surprising that the effect of this continuously overhanging gloom should be to induce a frequent depression of spirits amongst the majority of the little population exiles as they were from their mother earth and not unlikely as it seemed to be swept far away into the regions of another planet- ary sphere probably count timascheff captain servadac and lieutenant procope were the only members of the community who could bring any scientific judgment to bear upon the uncertainty that was before them but a general sense of the strangeness of their situation could not fail at times to weigh heavily upon the minds of all under these circumstances it was very necessary to counteract the tendency to despond by continual diversion and the recreation of skating thus op- portunely provided seemed just the thing to arouse the flagging spirits and to restore a wholesome excitement with dogged obstinacy isaac hakkabut refused to take any share either in the labors or the amuse- ments of the colony in spite of the cold he had not been seen since the day of his arrival from gourbi island captain servadac had strictly for- bidden any communication with him and the smoke that rose from the cabin chimney of the hansa was the sole indication of the proprietor being still on board there was nothing to prevent him if he chose from partaking gratuitously of the volcanic light and heat which were being enjoyed by all be- sides but rather than abandon his close and per- sonal oversight of his precious cargo he preferred to sacrifice his own slender stock of fuel both the schooner and the tartan had been care- fully moored in the way that seemed to promise best for withstanding the rigor of the winter after seeing the vessels made secure in the frozen creek lieutenant procope following the example of many arctic explorers had the precaution to have the ice beveled away from the keels so that there should be no risk of the ships sides being crushed by the increasing pressure he hoped that they would follow any rise in the level of the ice- field and when the thaw should come that they would easily regain their proper water-line on his last visit to gourbi island the lieutenant had ascertained that north east and west far as the eye could reach the gallian sea had become one uniform sheet of ice one spot alone refused to freeze this was the pool immediately below the central cavern the receptacle for the stream of burning lava it was entirely enclosed by rocks and if ever a few icicles were formed there by the action of the cold they were very soon melted by the fiery shower hissing and spluttering as the hot lava came in contact with it the water was in a continual state of ebullition and the fish that abounded in its depths defied the angler's craft they were as ben zoof remarked too much boiled to bite at the beginning of april the weather changed the sky became overcast but there was no rise in the temperature unlike the polar winters of the earth which ordinarily are affected by atmospheric influence and liable to slight intermissions of their severity at various shiftings of the wind gallia's winter was caused by her immense distance from the source of all light and heat and the cold was consequently destined to go on steadily increasing until it reached the limit ascertained by fourier to be the normal temperature of the realms of space with the over-clouding of the heavens there arose a violent tempest but although the wind raged with an almost inconceivable fury it was unac- companied by either snow or rain its effect upon off on a comet  the burning curtain that covered the aperture of the central hall was very remarkable so far from there being any likelihood of the fire being extin- guished by the vehemence of the current of air the hurricane seemed rather to act as a ventilator which fanned the flame into greater activity and the utmost care was necessary to avoid being burnt by the fragments of lava that were drifted into the interior of the grotto more than once the curtain itself was rifted entirely asunder but only to close up again immediately after allowing a momentary draught of cold air to penetrate the hall in a way that was refreshing and rather ad- vantageous than otherwise on the th of april after an absence of about four days the new satellite to ben zoof's great satisfaction made its reappearance in a crescent form a circumstance that seemed to justify the anticipation that henceforward it would continue to make a periodic revolution every fortnight the crust of ice and snow was far too stout for the beaks of the strongest birds to penetrate and accordingly large swarms had left the island and following the human population had taken refuge on the volcanic promontory not that there the barren shore had anything in the way of nourish- ment to offer them but their instinct impelled them to haunt now the very habitations which formerly they would have shunned scraps of food were thrown to them from the galleries these were speedily devoured but were altogether inadequate in quantity to meet the demand at length em- boldened by hunger several hundred birds ventured through the tunnel and took up their quarters ac- tually in nina's hive congregating in the large hall the half-famished creatures did not hesitate to snatch bread meat or food of any description from the hands of the residents as they sat at table and soon became such an intolerable nuisance that it formed one of the daily diversions to hunt them down but although they were vigorously attacked by stones and sticks and even occasionally by shot it was with some difficulty that their number could be sensibly reduced by a systematic course of warfare the bulk of the birds were all expelled with the exception of about a hundred which began to build in the crev- ices of the rocks these were left in quiet posses- sion of their quarters as not only was it deemed advisable to perpetuate the various breeds but it was found that these birds acted as a kind of police never failing either to chase away or to kill any others of their species who infringed upon what they appeared to regard as their own special privi- lege in intruding within the limits of their domain on the th loud cries were suddenly heard issu- ing from the mouth of the principal gallery help help i shall be killed pablo in a moment recognized the voice as nina's outrunning even ben zoof he hurried to the assist- ance of his little playmate and discovered that she was being attacked by half a dozen great sea-gulls and only after receiving some severe blows from their beaks could he succeed by means of a stout cudgel in driving them away tell me nina what is this he asked as soon as the tumult had subsided the child pointed to a bird which she was cares- sing tenderly in her bosom a pigeon exclaimed ben zoof who had reached the scene of the commotion a carrier-pigeon and by all the saints of montmartre there is a little bag attached to its neck he took the bird and rushing into the hall placed it in servadac's hands another message no doubt cried the captain from our unknown friend let us hope that this time he has given us his name and address all crowded round eager to hear the news in the struggle with the gulls the bag had been parti- ally torn open but still contained the following dis- patch  gallia chemin parcouru du lev mars au lev avril    distance du soleil    capte nerina en passant vivres vont manquer et the rest of the document had been so damaged by the beaks of the gulls that it was illegible ser- vadac was wild with vexation he felt more and more convinced that the writer was a frenchman and that the last line indicated that he was in dis- tress from scarcity of food the very thought of a fellow-countryman in peril of starvation drove him well-nigh to distraction and it was in vain that search was made everywhere near the scene of conflict in hopes of finding the missing scrap that might bear a signature or address suddenly little nina who had again taken pos- session of the pigeon and was hugging it to her breast said look here ben zoof and as she spoke she pointed to the left wing of the bird the wing bore the faint impress of a postage stamp and the one word formentera chapter xxiv a sledge-ride formentera was at once recognized by serva- dac and the count as the name of one of the small- est of the balearic islands it was more than prob- able that the unknown writer had thence sent out the mysterious documents and from the message just come to hand by the carrier-pigeon it ap- peared all but certain that at the beginning of april a fortnight back he had still been there in one important particular the present communication differed from those that had preceded it it was written entirely in french and exhibited none of the ecstatic exclamations in other languages that had been remarkable in the two former papers the concluding line with its intimation of failing provisions amounted almost to an appeal for help captain servadac briefly drew attention to these points and concluded by saying my friends we must without delay hasten to the assistance of this unfortunate man for my part said the count i am quite ready to accompany you it is not unlikely that he is not alone in his distress lieutenant procope expressed much surprise we must have passed close to formentera he said when we explored the site of the balearic  amazing stories isles this fragment must be very small it must be smaller than the remaining splinter of gibraltar or ceuta otherwise surely it would never have es- caped our observation however small it may be replied servadac we must find it how far off do you suppose it is it must be a hundred and twenty leagues away said the lieutenant thoughtfully and i do not quite understand how you would propose to get there why on skates of course no difficulty in that i should imagine answered servadac and he ap- pealed to the count for confirmation of his opinion the count assented but procope looked doubtful your enterprise is generous he said and i should be most unwilling to throw any unnecessary obstacle in the way of its execution but pardon me if i submit to you a few considerations which to my mind are very important first of all the thermometer is already down to  below zero and the keen wind from the south is making the tem- perature absolutely unendurable in the second place supposing you travel at the rate of twenty leagues a day you would be exposed for at least six consecutive days and thirdly your expedition will be of small avail unless you convey provisions not only for yourselves but for those whom you hope to relieve we can carry our own provisions on our backs in knapsacks interposed servadac quickly un- willing to recognize any difficulty in the way granted that you can answered the lieutenant quietly but where on this level ice-field will you find shelter in your periods of rest you must perish with cold you will not have the chance of digging out ice-huts like the esquimaux as to rest said servadac we shall take none we shall keep on our way continuously by traveling day and night without intermission we shall not be more than three days in reaching formentera believe me persisted the lieutenant calmly your enthusiasm is carrying you too far the feat you propose is impossible but even conceding the possibility of your success in reaching your destina- tion what service do you imagine that you half- starved and half-frozen yourself could render to those who are already perishing by want and ex- posure you would only bring them away to die the obvious and dispassionate reasoning of the lieutenant could not fail to impress the minds of those who listened to him the impracticability of the journey became more and more apparent un- protected on that drear expanse any traveler must assuredly succumb to the snow-drifts that were con- tinually being whirled across it but hector ser- vadac animated by the generous desire of rescuing a suffering fellow-creature could scarcely be brought within the bounds of common sense against his better judgment he was still bent upon the expedition and ben zoof declared himself ready to accompany his master in the event of count timascheff hesitating to encounter the peril which the undertaking involved but the count entirely repudiated all idea of shrinking from what quite as much as the captain he regarded as a sacred duty and turning to lieutenant procope told him that unless some better plan could be devised he was prepared to start off at once and make the at- tempt to skate across to formentera the lieuten- ant who was lost in thought made no immediate reply i wish we had a sledge said ben zoof i dare say that a sledge of some sort could be contrived said the count but then we should have no dogs or reindeers to draw it why not rough-shoe the two horses they would never be able to endure the cold objected the count never mind said servadac let us get our sledge and put them to the test something must be done i think said lieutenant procope breaking his thoughtful silence that i can tell you of a sledge already provided for your hand and i can suggest a motive power surer and swifter than horses what do you mean  was the eager inquiry i mean the dobryna's yawl answered the lieu- tenant and i have no doubt that the wind would carry her rapidly along the ice the idea seemed admirable lieutenant procope was well aware to what marvelous perfection the americans had brought their sail-sledges and had heard how in the vast prairies of the united states they had been known to outvie the speed of an ex- press train occasionally attaining a rate of more than a hundred miles an hour the wind was still blowing hard from the south and assuming that the yawl could be propelled with a velocity of about fifteen or at least twelve leagues an hour he reck- oned that it was quite possible to reach formentera within twelve hours that is to say in a single day between the intervals of sunrise and sunrise the yawl was about twelve feet long and capable of holding five or six people the addition of a couple of iron runners would be all that was requisite to convert it into an excellent sledge which if a sail were hoisted might be deemed certain to make a rapid progress over the smooth surface of the ice for the protection of the passengers it was proposed to erect a kind of wooden roof lined with strong cloth beneath this could be packed a supply of pro- visions some warm furs some cordials and a port- able stove to be heated by spirits of wine for the outward journey the wind was as favor- able as could be desired but it was to be apprehend- ed that unless the direction of the wind should change the return would be a matter of some diffi- culty a system of tacking might be carried out to a certain degree but it was not likely that the yawl would answer her helm in any way corresponding to what would occur in the open sea captain servadac however would not listen to any representation of probable difficulties the future he said must pro- vide for itself the engineer and several of the sailors set vigor- ously to work and before the close of the day the yawl was furnished with a pair of stout iron run- ners curved upwards in front and fitted with a metal fin designed to assist in maintaining the directness of her course the roof was put on and beneath it were stored the provisions the wraps and the cooking utensils a strong desire was expressed by lieutenant procope that he should be allowed to accompany captain servadac instead of count timascheff it was inadvisable for all three of them to go as in case of there being several persons to be rescued the off on a comet  space at their command would be quite inadequate the lieutenant urged that he was the most experi- enced seaman and as such was best qualified to take command of the sledge and the management of the sails and as it was not to be expected that servadac would resign his intention of going in person to relieve his fellow-countryman procope submitted his own wishes to the count the count was himself very anxious to have his share in the philanthropic enterprise and demurred considerably to the pro- posals  he yielded however after a time to serva- dac's representations that in the event of the expedi- tion proving disastrous the little colony would need his services alike as governor and protector and overcoming his reluctance to be left out of the peril- ous adventure was prevailed upon to remain behind for the general good of the community at nina's hive at sunrise on the following morning the th of april captain servadac and the lieutenant took their places in the yawl the thermometer was more than  below zero and it was with deep emotion that their companions beheld them thus em- barking upon the vast white plain ben zoof's heart was too full for words count timascheff could not forbear pressing his two brave friends to his bosom the spaniards and the russian sailors crowded round for a farewell shake of the hand and little nina her great eyes flooded with tears held up her face for a parting kiss the sad scene was not permitted to last long the sail was quickly hoisted and the sledge just as if it had expanded a huge white wing was in a little while carried far away beyond the horizon light and unimpeded the yawl scudded on with incredible speed two sails a mainsail and a jib were arranged to catch the wind to the greatest advantage and the travelers estimated that their progress would be little under the rate of twelve leagues an hour the motion of their novel vehicle was singularly gentle the oscillation being less than that of an ordinary railway-carriage while the diminished force of gravity contributed to the swift- ness except that the clouds of ice-dust raised by the metal runners were an evidence that they had not actually left the level surface of the ice the captain and-lieutenant might again and again have imagined that they were being conveyed through the air in a balloon lieutenant procope with his head all muffled up for fear of frost-bite took an occasional peep through an aperture that had been intentionally left in the roof and by the help of a compass main- tained a proper and straight course for formentera nothing could be more dejected than the aspect of that frozen sea not a single living creature relieved the solitude both the travelers procope from a scientific point of view servadac from an aesthetic were alike impressed by the solemnity of the scene and when the lengthened shadow of the sail cast upon the ice by the oblique rays of the setting sun had disappeared and day had given place to night the two men drawn together as by an involuntary impulse mutually held each other's hands in silence there had been a new moon on the previous eve- ning but in the absence of moonlight the constella- tions shone with remarkable brilliancy the new pole-star close upon the horizon was resplendent and even had lieutenant procope been destitute of a compass he would have had no difficulty in holding his course by the guidance of that alone however great was the distance that separated gallia from the sun it was after all manifestly insignificant in comparison with the remoteness of the nearest of the fixed stars observing that servadac was completely ab- sorbed in his own thoughts lieutenant procope had leisure to contemplate some of the present perplex- ing problems and to ponder over the true astronom- ical position the last of the three mysterious docu- ments had represented that gallia in conformity with kepler's second law had traveled along her orbit during the month of march twenty millions of leagues less than she had done in the previous month yet in the same time her distance from the sun had nevertheless been increased by thirty-two millions of leagues she was now therefore in the center of the zone of telescopic planets that revolve between the orbits of mars and jupiter and had captured for herself a satellite which according to the document was nerina one of the asteroids most recently identified if thus then it was within the power of the unknown writer to estimate with such apparent certainty gallia's exact position was it not likely that his mathematical calculations would enable him to arrive at some definite conclusion as to the date at which she would begin again to ap- proach the sun nay was it not to be expected that he had already estimated with sufficient approxima- tion to truth what was to be the true length of the gallian year so intently had they each separately been fol- lowing their own train of thought that daylight re- appeared almost before the travelers were aware of it on consulting their instruments they found that they must have traveled close upon a hundred leagues since they started and they resolved to slacken their speed the sails were accordingly taken in a little and in spite of the intensity of the cold the explorers ventured out of their shelter in order that they might reconnoiter the plain which was apparently as boundless as ever it was com- pletely desert not so much as a single point of rock relieved the bare uniformity of its surface are we not considerably to the west of formen- tera asked servadac after examining the chart most likely replied procope i have taken the same course as i should have done at sea and i have kept some distance to windward of the island we can bear straight down upon it whenever we like bear down then now and as quickly as you can the yawl was at once put with her head to the northeast and captain servadac in defiance of the icy blast remained standing at the bow his gaze fixed on the horizon all at once his eye brightened look look he exclaimed pointing to a faint outline that broke the monotony of the circle that divided the plain from the sky in an instant the lieutenant had seized his tele- scope i see what you mean said he it is a pylon that has been used for some geodesic survey the next moment the sail was filled and the yawl was bearing down upon the object with inconceiv- able swiftness both captain servadac and the lieu- tenant too excited to utter a word mile after mile  amazing stories the distance rapidly grew less and as they drew nearer the pylon they could see that it was erected on a low mass of rocks that was the sole interrup- tion to the dull level of the field of ice no wreath of smoke rose above the little island it was mani- festly impossible they conceived that any human being could thei'e have survived the cold the sad presentiment forced itself upon their minds that it was a mere cairn to which they had been hurrying ten minutes later and they were so near the rock that the lieutenant took in his sail convinced that the impetus already attained would be sufficient to carry him to the land servadac's heart bounded as he caught sight of a fragment of blue canvas flut- tering in the wind from the top of the pylon it was all that now remained of the french national stand- ard at the foot of the pylon stood a miserable shed its shutters tightly closed no other habita- tion was to be seen the entire island was less than a quarter of a mile in circumference and the con- clusion was irresistible that it was the sole surviv- ing remnant of formentera once a member of the balearic archipelago to leap on shore to clamber over the slippery stones and to reach the cabin was but the work of a few moments the worm-eaten door was bolted on the inside servadac began to knock with all his might no answer neither shouting nor knocking could draw forth a reply let us force it open procope he said the two men put their shoulders to the door which soon yielded to their vigorous efforts and they found themselves inside the shed and in almost total darkness by opening a shutter they admitted what daylight they could at first sight the wretched place seemed to be deserted the little grate contained the ashes of a fire long since extin- guished all looked black and desolate another instant's investigation however revealed a bed in the extreme corner and extended on the bed a hu- man form dead sighed servadac dead of cold and hun- ger lieutenant procope bent down and anxiously con- templated the body no he is alive he said and drawing a small flask from his pocket he poured a few drops of brandy between the lips of the senseless man there was a faint sigh followed by a feeble voice which uttered the one word gallia yes yes gallia echoed servadac eagerly my comet my comet said the voice so low as to be almost inaudible and the unfortunate man relapsed again into unconsciousness where have i seen this man thought servadac to himself his face is strangely familiar to me but it was no time for deliberation not a mo- ment was to be lost in getting the unconscious astronomer away from his desolate quarters he was soon conveyed to the yawl his books his scanty wardrobe his papers his instruments and the blackboard which had served for his calculations were quickly collected the wind by a fortuitous providence had shifted into a favorable quarter they set their sail with all speed and ere long were on their journey back from formentera thirty-six hours later the brave travelers were greeted by the acclamations of their fellow-colo- nists who had been most anxiously awaiting their reappearance and the still senseless savant who had neither opened his eyes nor spoken a word throughout the journey was safely deposited in the warmth and security of the great hall of nina's hive end of first book concluded in may issue now that you have looked over the first issue of amazing stories the editor would very much like to know how you like the new magazine in the coming issues we shall probably run a department entitled readers letters which will be a forum where our readers can discuss the various problems in connection with these stories very often you are puzzled over certain scientific matter contained in stories of this kind and wish to get more information we shall try hard to keep this new department for the benefit of all and will try to publish all letters received from readers of amazing stories if on the other hand you have comments criticisms and suggestions be good enough to let us have all of these the editor would also like to know whether you like the present makeup of the magazine that is one story in two parts as for instance the one we present this month off on a comet with the balance in the next issue--or whether you would rather have the complete story in one issue without the short stories as printed in the present number rest assured that the editor will be guided by the majority at all times a word from you will be greatly appreciated --editor the new accelerator by  hg wells we went out by his gate into the road and there we made a minute examination of the statuesque passing traffic the top of the wheels and some of the legs of the horses of this char-a-banc the end of the whip-lash and the lower jaw of the conductor--who was just beginning to yawn--were perceptibly in motion but all tbc rest of the lumbering con- veyance seemed still and quite noiseless except for a faint rattling that came from one man's throat certainly if ever a man found a guinea when he was looking for a pin it is my good friend professor gibberne i have heard before of in- vestigators over- shooting the mark but never quite to the extent that he has done he has really this time at any rate without any touch of exaggeration in the phrase found something to revolutionize human life and that when he was simply seeking an all-round nervous stimulant to bring lan- guid people up to the stresses of these pushful days i have tasted the stuff now several times and i cannot do better than describe the effect the thing had on me that there are astonishing ex- periences in store for all in search of new sensations will be- come apparent enough professor gibberne as many people know is my neighbor in folkestone unless my memory plays me a trick his portrait at various ages has already appeared in various magazines but i am unable to look it up because i have lent my volume to someone who has never sent it back the reader may perhaps recall the high forehead and the singularly long black eyebrows that give such a mephistophelian touch to his face he occupies one of those pleasant little detached houses in the mixed style that make the western end of the upper sand- gate road so interesting his is the one with the flemish gables and portico and it is in the little room with the mullioned bay window that he works when he is down here and in which of an evening we have so often smoked and talked together he is a mighty jester but besides he likes to talk to me about his it is enough to say in commenda- tion of this very exciting story that it is worthy of the author h g wells has achieved a wonderful reputation in the field of serious writ- ing as well as of fiction here for the entertainment of the reader we present a scientific story by him the hero of which story is a physiologist and chemist and now we deal with the science of the human system and are told the story of a wonderful achieve- ment which must be read in detail to be appreciated mr wells matter is not only znvid and even valuable but there is a picturesqueness about his language which attracts as it is dis- tinctively the english of the mother country   amazing stories work he is one of those men who find a help and stimulus in talking and so i have been able to fol- low the conception of the new accelerator right up from a very early stage of course the greater por- tion of his experimental work is not done in folke- stone but in gower street in the fine new labora- tory next to the hospital that he has been the first to use as everyone knows or at least as all intelligent people know the special field in which gibberne has gained so great and deserved a reputation among physiologists includes the action of drugs upon the nervous system on the subjects of soporifics sedatives and anaesthetics he is i am told un- equalled he is also a chemist of considerable emin- ence and i suppose in the subtle and complex jungle of riddles that shadows the ganglion cell and the axis fibre there are little cleared places of his mak- ing little glades of illumination which until he sees fit to publish his results are still inaccessible to every other living man and in the last few years he has been particularly assiduous upon the question of nervous stimulants and already before the dis- covery of the new accelerator had attained great success with them medical science has to thank him for at least three distinct and absolutely safe invigorators of unrivalled value to practising men in cases of exhaustion the preparation known as gibberne's b syrup has i suppose saved more lives already than any lifeboat on the coast but none of these little things begin to satisfy me yet he told me nearly a year ago either they increase the central energy without affecting the nerves or they simply increase the available energy by lowering the nervous conductivity and all of them are unequal and local in their operation one wakes up the heart and viscera and leaves the brain stupefied one gets at the brain champagne fashion and does nothing good for the solar plexus and what i want and what if it's an earthly possibility i mean to have--is a stimulant that stimulates all round that wakes you up for a time from the crown of your head to the tip of your great toe and makes you go two--or even three to everybody else's one eh that's the thing i'm after it would tire a man i said not a doubt of it and you'd eat double or treble--and all that but just think what the thing would mean imagine yourself with a little phial like this--he held up a little bottle of green glass and marked his points with it--and that in this precious phial is the power to think twice ps fast move twice as quickly do twice as much work in a given time as you could otherwise do but is such a thing possible i believe so if it isn't i've wasted ray time for a year these various preparations of the hypo- phosphites for example seem to show that some- thing of the sort    even if it was only one and a half times as fast it would do it would do i said if you were a statesman in a corner for example time rushing up against you something urgent to be done eh he could dose his private secretary i said and gain--double time and think if you for example wanted to finish a book usually i said i wish i'd never begun em or a doctor driven to death wants to sit down and think out a case or a barrister--or a man cramming for an examination worth a guinea a drop said i and more--to men like that and in a duel again said gibberne where it all depends on your quickness in pulling the trigger or in fencing i echoed you see said gibberne if i get it as an all- round thing it will really do you no harm at all-- except perhaps to an infinitesimal degree it brings you nearer old age you will just have lived twice to other peoples once-- i suppose i meditated in a duel--it would be fair that's a question for the seconds said gib- berne i harked back further and you really think such a thing is possible i said as possible said gibberne and glanced at something that went throbbing by the window as a motorbus as a matter of fact- he paused and smiled at me deeply and tapped slowly on the edge of his desk with the green phial i think i know the stuff    already i've got something coming the nervous smile upon his face betrayed the gravity of his revelation he rarely talked of his actual experimental work unless things were very near the end and it may be it may be--i shouldn't be surprised--it may even do the thing at a greater rate than twice it will be rather a big thing i hazarded it will be i think rather a big thing but i don't think he quite knew what a big thing it was to be for all that i remember we had several talks about the stuff after that the new accelerator he called it and his tone about it grew more confident on each occasion sometimes he talked nervously of unex- pected physiological results its use might have and then he would get a little unhappy at others he was frankly mercenary and we debated long and anxiously how the preparation might be turned to commercial account it's a good thing said gib- berne a tremendous thing i know i'm giving the world something and i think it only reasonable we should expect the world to pay the dignity of science is all very well but i think somehow i must have the monopoly of the stuff for say ten years i don't see why all the fun in life should go to the dealers in ham it seemed to me that gibberne was really pre- paring no less than the absolute acceleration of life suppose a man repeatedly dosed with such a preparation he would live an active and record life indeed but he would be an adult at eleven middle- aged at twenty-five and by thirty well on the road to senile decay it seemed to me that so far gibberne was going to do for anyone who took his drug exactly what nature has done for the jews an orientals who are men in their teens and aged by fifty and quicker in thought and act than we are all the time the marvel of drugs has always been great to my mind you can madden a man calm a man make him incredibly strong and alert or a helpless log quicken this passion and allay that all by means of drugs and here was a new miracle to be added to this strange armory of phials the doctors use but gibberne was far too eager upon the new accelerator  his technical points to enter very keenly into my aspect of the question it was the th or th of august when he told me the distillation that would decide his failure or success for a time was going forward as we talked and it was on the th that he told me the thing was done and the new accelerator a tangible reality in the world i met him as i was going up the sand- gate hill toward folkestone--i think i was going to get my hair cut and he came hurrying down to meet me--i suppose he was coming to ray house to tell me at once of his success i remember that his eyes were unusually bright and his face flushed and i noted the swift alacrity of his step it's done he cried and gripped my hand speaking very fast it's more than done come up to my house and see really really he shouted incredibly come up and see and it does--twice it does more much more it scares me come up and see the stuff taste it try it it's the most amazing stuff on earth he gripped my arm and walking at such a pace that he forced me into a trot went shouting with me up the hill a whole power-bus of people turned and stared at us in unison after the manner of people in power-buses it was one of those hot clear days that folkestone sees so much of every color incredibly bright and every outline hard there was a breeze of course but not so much breeze as sufficed under these con- ditions to keep me cool and dry i panted for mercy i'm not walking fast am i cried gibberne and slackened his pace to a quick march you've been taking some of this stuff i puffed no he said at the utmost a drop of water that stood in a beaker from which i had washed out the last traces of the stuff i took some last night you know but that is ancient history now and it goes twice i said nearing his door- way in a grateful perspiration it goes a thousand times many thousand times cried gibberne with a dramatic gesture flinging open his early english carved oak gate phew said i and followed him to the door i don't know how many times it goes he said with his latch-key in his hand and you - it throws all sorts of light on nervous physiology it kicks the theory of vision into a perfectly new shape    heaven knows how many thousand times we'll try all that after the thing is to try the stuff now try the stuff i said as we went along the passage rather said gibberne turning on me in his study there it is in that little green phial there unless you happen to be afraid i am a careful man by nature and only theoreti- cally adventurous i was afraid but on the other hand there is pride well i haggled you say you've tried it i've tried it he said and i don't look hurt by it do i  i don't even look livery and i feel- i sat down give me the potion i said if the worst comes to the worst it will save having my hair cut and that i think is one of the most hateful duties of a civilized man how do you take the mixture with water said gibberne whacking down a carafe he stood up in front of his desk and regarded me in his easy chair his manner was suddenly af- fected by a touch of the harley street specialist it's rum stuff you know he said i made a gesture with my hand i must warn you in the first place as soon as you've got it down to shut your eyes and open them very cautiously in a minute or so's time one still sees the sense of vision is a question of length of vibration consequently of frequency of impacts but there's a kind of shock to the retina a nasty giddy confusion just at the time if the eyes are open keep em shut shut i said good and the next thing is keep still don't begin to whack about you may fetch something a nasty rap if you do remember you will be going several thousand times faster than you ever did before heart lungs muscles brain--everything--and you will hit hard without knowing it you won't know it you know you'll feel just as you do now only everything in the world will seem to be going ever so many thousand times slower than it ever went before that's what makes it so deuced queer lor i said and you mean- you'll see said he and took up a little measure he glanced at the material on his desk glasses he said water all here mustn't take too much for the first attempt the little phial glucked out its precious contents don't forget what  told you he said turning the contents of the measure in the manner of an italian waiter measuring whisky sit with the eyes tightly shut and in absolute stillness for two minutes he said then you will hear me speak he added an inch or so of water to the little dose in each glass by-the-by he said don't put your glass down keep it in your hand and rest your hand on your knee yes--so and now- he raised his glass the new accelerator i said the new accelerator he answered and we touched glasses and drank and instantly i closed my eyes you know that blank non-existence into which one drops when one has taken gas for an in- definite interval it was like that then i heard gibberne telling me to wake up and i stirred and opened my eyes there he stood as he had been standing glass still in hand it was empty that was all the difference well said i nothing out of the way nothing a slight feeling of exhilaration per- haps nothing more sounds things are still i said by jove yes they are still except the sort of faint pat patter like rain falling on different things what is it analyzed sounds i think he said but i am not sure he glanced at the window have you ever seen a curtain before a window fixed in that way before i followed his eyes and there was the end of the  amazing stories curtain frozen as it were corner high in the act of flapping briskly in the breeze no said i that's odd and here he said and opened the hand that held the glass naturally i winced expecting the glass to smash but so far from smashing it did not even seem to stir it hung in mid-air--motion- less roughly speaking said gibberne an ob- ject in these latitudes falls  feet in a second now only you see it hasn't fallen yet for the hundredth part of a second that gives you some idea of the pace of my accelerator and he waved his hand round and round over and under the slowly sinking glass finally he took it by the bottom pulled it down and placed it very carefully on the table eh he said to me and laughed that seems all right i said and began very gingerly to raise myself from my chair i felt per- fectly well very light and comfortable and quite confident in my mind i was going fast all over my heart for example was beating a thousand times a second but that caused me no discomfort at all i looked out of the window an immovable cyclist head down and with a frozen puff of dust behind his driving-wheel scorched to overtake a galloping char-a-banc that did not stir i gaped in amazement at this incredible spectacle gibberne i cried how long will this confounded stuff last heaven knows he answered last time i took it  went to bed and slept it off i tell you i was frightened it must have lasted some minutes i think--it seemed like hours but after a bit it slows down rather suddenly i believe i was proud to observe that i did not feel fright- ened--i suppose because there were two of us why shouldn't we go out i asked why not they'll see us not they goodness no we shall be going a thousand times faster than the quickest con- juring trick that was ever done come along which way shall we go window or door and out by the window we went assuredly of all the strange experiences that i have ever had or imagined or read of other people having or imagining that little raid i made with gibberne on the folkestone leas under the in- fluence of the new accelerator was the strangest and maddest of all we went out by his gate into the road and there we made a minute examination of the statuesque passing traffic the tops of the wheels and some of the legs of the horses of this char-a-banc the end of the whip-lash and the lower jaw of the conductor--who was just beginning to yawn--were perceptibly in motion but all the rest of the lumbering conveyance seemed still and quite noiseless except for a faint rattling that came from one man's throat and as parts of this frozen edifice there were a driver you know and a conductor and eleven people the effect as we walked about the thing began by being madly queer and ended by being--disagreeable there they were people like ourselves and yet not like ourselves frozen in care- less attitudes caught in mid-gesture a girl and a man smiled at one another a leering smile that threatened to last for evermore a woman in a floppy capelline rested her arm on the rail and stared at gibberne's house with the unwinking stare of eternity a man stroked his mustaohe like a figure of wax and another stretched a tiresome stiff hand with extended fingers towards his loosened hat we stared at them we laughed at them we made faces at them and then a sort of disgust of them came upon us and we turned away and walked around in front of the cyclist towards the leas goodness cried gibberne suddenly look there he pointed and there at the tip of his finger and sliding down the air with wings flapping slowly and at the speed of an exceptionally languid srail--was a bee and so we came out upon the leas there the thing seemed madder than ever the band was playing in the upper stand though all the sound it made for us was a low-pitched wheezy rattle a sort of prolonged last sigh that passed at times into a sound like the slow muffled ticking of some mon- strous clock frozen people stood erect strange silent self-conscious-looking dummies hung unstab- ly in mid-stride promenading upon the grass i passed close to a little poodle dog suspended in the act of leaping and watched the slow movement of his legs as he sank to earth lord look here cried gibberne and we halted a moment before a magnifi- cent person in white faint-striped flannels white shoes and a panama hat who turned back to wink at two gaily dressed ladies he had passed a wink studied with such leisurely deliberation as we could afford is an unattractive thing it loses any quality of alert gaiety and one remarks that the winking eye does not completely close that under its drooping lid appears the lower edge of an eye- ball and a little line of white heaven give me memory said i and i will never wink again or smile said gibberne with his eye on the lady's answering teeth it's infernally hot somehow said i let's go slower oh come along said gibberne we picked our way among the bath-chairs in the path many of the people sitting in the chairs seemed almost natural in their passive poses but the contorted scarlet of the bandsmen was not a restful thing to see a purple-faced little gentle- man was frozen in the midst of a violent struggle to refold his newspaper against the wind there were many evidences that all these people in their sluggish way were exposed to a considerable breeze a breeze that had no existence so far as our sensa- tions went we came out and walked a little way from the crowd and turned and regarded it to see all that multitude changed to a picture smitten rigid as it were into the semblance of realistic wax was impossibly wonderful it was absurd of course but it filled me with an irrational an exultant sense of superior advantage consider the wonder of it all that i had said and thought and done since the stuff had begun to work in my veins had happened so far as those people so far as the world in general went in the twinkling of an eye the new ac- celerator- i began but gibberne interrupted me there's that infernal old woman he said what old woman lives next door to me said gibberne has a lapdog that yaps gods the temptation is strong there is something very boyish and impulsive about gibberne at times before i could expostulate the new accelerator  with him he had dashed forward snatched the un- fortunate animal out of visible existence and was runniug violently with it towards the cliff of the leas it was most extraordinary the little brute you know didn't bark or wriggle or make the slightest sign of vitality it kept quite stiffly in an attitude of somnolent repose and gibberne held it by the neck it was like running about with a dog of wood gibberne i cried put it down then i said something else if you run like that gib- berne i cried you'll set your clothes on fire your linen trousers are going brown as it is he clapped his hand on his thigh and stood hesitating on the verge gibberne i cried com- ing up put it down this heat is too much it's our running so two or three miles a second fric- tion of the air what he said glancing at the dog friction of the air i shouted friction of the air going too fast like meteorites and things too hot and gibberne gibberne i'm all over pricking and a sort of perspiration you can'see people stirring slightly i believe the stuff's work- ing off put that dog down eh he said it's working off i repeated we're too hot and the stuff's working off i'm wet through he stared at me then at the band the wheezy rattle of whose performance was certainly going faster then with a tremendous sweep of his arm he hurled the dog away from him and it went spin- ning upward still inanimate and hung at last over the grouped parasols of a knot of chattering people gibberne was gripping my elbow by jove he cried i believe it is a sort of hot pricking and --yes that man's moving his pocket-handkerchief perceptibly we must get out of this sharp but we could not get out of it sharply enough luckily perhaps for we might have run and if we had run we should i believe have burst into flames almost certainly we should have burst into flames you know we had neither of us thought of that  but before we could even begin to run the action of the drug had ceased it was the business of a minute fraction of a second the effect of the new accelerator passed like the draw- ing of a curtain vanished in the movement of a hand i heard gibberne's voice in infinite alarm sit down he said and flop down upon the turf at the edge of the leas i sat--scorching as i sat there is a patch of burnt grass there still where i sat down the whole stagnation seemed to wake up as i did so the disarticulated vibi-ation of the band rushed together into a blast of music the promenaders put their feet down and walked their ways the papers and flags began flapping smiles passed into words the winker finished his wink and went on his way complacently and all the seated people moved and spoke the whole world had come alive again was going as fast as we were or rather we were going no faster than the rest of the world it was like slowing down as one comes into a railway station everything seemed to spin around for a second or two i had the most transient feeling of nausea and that was all and the little dog which had seemed to hang for a moment when the force of gibberne's arm was expended fell with a swift acceleration clean through a lady's parasol that was the saving of us unless it was for one corpulent old gentleman in a bath-chair who cer- tainly did start at the sight of us and afterwards regarded us at intervals with a darkly suspicious eye and finally i believe said something to his nurse about us  doubt if a solitary person re- marked our sudden appearance among them plop we must have appeared abruptly we ceased to smoulder almost at once though the turf beneath me was uncomfortably hot the attention of everyone including even the amusements association band which on this occasion for the only time in its history got out of tune was arrested by the amazing fact and the still more amazing yapping and uproar caused by the fact that a respectable overfed lapdog sleeping quietly to the east of the bandstand should suddenly fall through the parasol of a lady on the west--in a slightly singed condition due to the ex- treme velocity of its movements through the air in these absurd days too when we are all trying to be as psychic and silly and superstitious as possible people got up and trod on other people chairs were overturned the leas policeman ian how the matter settled itself i do not know--we were much too anxious to disentangle ourselves from the affair and get out of range of the eye of the old gentleman in the bath-chair to make minute inquiries as soon as we were sufficiently cool and sufficiently recovered from our giddiness and nausea and confusion of mind to do so we stood up and skirting the crowd directed our steps back along the road below the metropole towards gibberne's house but amidst the din i heard very distinctly the gentleman who had been sitting beside the lady of the ruptured sunshade using quite unjustifiable threats and language to one of those chair-attend- ants who have inspector written on their caps if you didn't throw the dog he said who did the sudden return of movement and familiar noises and our natural anxiety about onrselves our clothes were still dreadfully hot and the fronts of the thighs of gibberne's white trousers were scorched a drabbish brown prevented the minute observations i should have liked to make on all these things indeed i really made no observations of any scientific value on that return the bee of course had gone i looked for that cyclist but he was already out of sight as we came into the upper sandgate hoad or hidden from us by traffic the char-a-banc however with its people now all alive and stirring was clattering along at a spanking pace almost abreast of the nearer church we noted however that the window-sill on which we had stepped in getting out of the house was slightly singed and that the impressions of our feet on the gravel of the path were unusually deep so it was i had my first experience of the new accelerator practically we had been running about and saying and doing all sorts of things in the space of a second or so of time we had lived half an hour while the band had played perhaps two bars but the effect it had upon us was that the whole world had stopped for our convenient inspection considering all things and particularly considering our rashness in venturing out of the house the experience might certainly have been much more disagreeable than it was it showed no doubt that gibberne has still much to learn before his continued on page  the man from the atom by  g peyton wertenbaker i looked down and professor martyn a tiny spcck in an automobile far below waved up to me cheerfully as he started his car and began to speed away he was fleeing the immediate danger of my growth when my feet would begin to cover an immense area until i could be almost entirely in space i am a lost soul and i am homesick yes homesick yet how vain is homesickness when one is without a home i can but be sick for a home that has gone for my home departed millions of years ago and there is now not even a trace of its former existence millions of years ago i say in all truth and earnestness but i must tell the tale--though there is no man left to understand it i well remember that morning when my friend professor mar- tyn called me to him on a matter of the greatest importance i may explain that the professor was one of those mysterious out- casts geniuses whom science would not recognize because they scorned the pettiness of the men who represented science mar- tyn was first of all a scientist but almost as equally he was a man of intense imagination and where the ordinary man crept along from detail to de- tail and required a complete model before being able to visualize the results of his work professor martyn first grasped the great re- sults of his contempla- ted work the vast far- reaching effects and then built with the end in view the professor had few friends ordinary men avoided him be- cause they were unable t o understand the greatness of his vision where he plainly saw pictures of worlds and universes they vainly groped among pictures of his words on printed pages that was their impression of a word a group of letters his was of the picture it presented in his mind i however though i had not the slightest claim to scientific knowledge was romantic to a high degree and always willing to carry out his strange experi- ments for the sake of the adventure and the strangeness of it all and so the advantages were equal i had a mysterious personage ready to fur- nish me with the unusual he had a willing sub- ject to try out his inventions for he reasoned quite naturally that should he himself perform the ex- periments the world would be in danger of losing a mentality it might eventually have need of and so it was that i hurried to him without the slightest hesitation upon that to me momentous day of days in my life i little realized the great change that soon would come over my existence yet i knew that i was in for an adventure certainly  the man from the atom  startling possibly fatal i had no delusions con- cerning my luck i found professor martyn in his laboratory bend- ing with the eyes of a miser counting his gold over a tiny machine that might easily have fitted in my pocket he did not see me for a moment but when he finally looked up with a sigh of regret that he must tear his eyes away from his new and wonder- ful brain-child whatever it might be he waved me a little unsteadily into a chair and sank down in one himself with the machine in his lap i waited placing myself in what i considered a receptive mood kirby he began abruptly at last have you ever read your alice in wonderland i gasped perhaps in my surprise alice in-- are you joking professor certainly not he assured me i speak in all seriousness why yes i have read it many times in fact it has always struck me as a book to appeal more to an adult than to a child but what--i can't see just how that is important he smiled perhaps i am playing with you unduly he said but do you remember the episode of the two pieces of cheese if my own recollection is correct one of which made one grow the other shrink i assented but i said incredulously certainly you cannot tell me you have spent your time in pre- paring magical cheeses he laughed aloud this time and then seeing my discomfort unburdened himself of his latest triumph no kirby not just that but i have indeed con- structed a machine that you will be incapable of be- lieving until you try it with this little object in my lap you could grow forever until there was nothing left in the universe to surpass or you could shrink so as to observe the minutest of atoms standing upon it as you now stand upon the earth it is an invention that will make scientific knowl- edge perfect he halted with flushed face and gleaming eyes i could find nothing to say for the thing was collossal magnificent in its possi- bilities if it worked but i could not resist a suspi- cion of so tiny a machine professor are you in absolute earnest i cried have i ever jested about so wonderful a thing he retorted quietly i knew he had not but surely that is merely a model it is the machine itself ii i was too astounded to speak at first but finally tell me about it i gasped this is certainly the most fantastic invention you have made yet how does it work i am afraid suggested professor martyn that you could not understand all the technical details it is horribly complicated and besides i am anx- ious to try it out but i will give you an idea of it of course you know that an object may be divi- ded in half forever as you have learned in high school without being entirely exhausted it is this principle that is used in shrinking i hardly understand the thing's mechanism myself--it was the result of an accident--but i know that the ma- chine not only divides every atom every molecule every electron of the body into two exactly equal parts but it accomplishes the same feat in itself thus keeping pace with its manipulator the matter it removes from the body is reduced to a gaseous form and left in the air there are six wires that you do not see which connect with the body while the machine itself is placed on the chest held by a small belt that carries wires to the front of the body where the two controlling buttons are placed when the user wishes to grow he presses the upper button and the machine then extracts atoms from the air which it converts by a reverse method from the first into atoms identical to certain others in the body the two atoms thus formed joining into one large particle of twice the original size as i said i have little idea of my invention ex- cept that it works by means of atomic energy i was intending to make an atomic energy motor when i observed certain parts to increase and diminish strangely in size it was practically by blind instinct that i have worked the thing up and now i fear i shall not be able to discover the source of my atomic energy until i can put together with great care another such machine for i am afraid to risk taking this apart for analysis and i i said suddenly with the awe i felt for such a discovery quite perceptible i fear in my tone i am to try out this machine if you are willing he said simply you must realize of course that there are a multitude of un- known dangers i know nothing of the complete effects of the machine but my experiments on in- animate objects have seemed satisfactory i am willing to take any risks i said enthu- siastically if you are willing to risk your great machine why don't you realize professor that this will revolutionize science there is noth- ing hardly that will be unknown astronomy will be complete for there will be nothing to do but to in- crease in size enough to observe beyond our at- mosphere or one could stand upon worlds like rocks to examine others exactly i have calculated that the effect of a huge foot covering whole countries would be slight so equally distributed would the weights be prob- ably it would rest upon tall buildings and trees with ease but in space of course no support should be necessary and then as you said one could shrink until the mysteries of electrons would be revealed of course there would be danger in descending into apparent nothingness not knowing where a new world-atom could be found upon which to stand but dangers must be risked but now kirby remarked the professor offi- cially time passes and i should like you to make in alice in the looking glass the beautiful play of of fancy which gave immortal fame to a logician and mathematician we read of the mysterious change in sice of the heroine the charming little alice it tells how she grew large and small according to what she ate but here we have increase in size and pushed to its utmost limit here we have treated the growth of a man to cosmic dimensions and we are told of his strange sensation and are led up to a sudden startling and impressive conclusion and are taken through the picture of his emotions and despair  amazing stories your little journey soon that i may quickly know its results have you any affairs you would like to put in order in case-- none i said i was always ready for these ex- periments and though this promised to be magni- ficently momentous i was all ready no if i re- turn in a few hours i shall find everything all right if not i am still prepared he beamed in ap- proval fine of course you understand that our ex- periment must take place at some secluded spot if you are ready we can proceed at once to a coun- try laboratory of mine that will i think be safe i assented and we hastily donned our overcoats the professor spending a moment or two collecting some necessary apparatus then we packed the ma- chine in a safe box and left his home are you all ready kirby the professor's voice was firm but my practiced ear could detect the slightest vibrations that indicated to me his in- tense inner feelings i hesitated a moment i was not afraid of going never that but there seemed something partaking almost of finality about this departure it was different from anything i had ever felt before all ready professor i said cheerfully after a brief moment are you going to magnify or minimize your- self it shall be growth i answered without a mo- ment's hesitation there the stars and what lay beyond  it was that i cared for the profes- sor looked at me earnestly deeply engrossed in thought finally he said kirby if you are to make an excursion into interstellar space you realize that not only would you freeze to death but also die from lack of air walking to a cabinet in the rear of the room he opened it and withdrew from it some strange look- ing paraphernalia this he said holding up a queer looking suit is made of a great quantity of interlocking metal cells hermetically sealed from which the air has been completely exhausted so as to give the cells a high vacuum these separate cells are then woven into the fabric when you wear this suit you will in fact be enclosed in a sort of thermos bottle no heat can leave this suit and the most intensive cold cannot penetrate through it i quickly got into the suit which was not as heavy as one might imagine it covered not only the en- tire body but the feet and hands as well the hand part being a sort of mitten after i had gotten into the suit the professor placed over my head a sort of transparent dome which he explained was made of strong unbreak- able bakelite the globe itself really was made of several globes one within the other the globes only touched at the lower rim the interstices where the globes did not touch formed a vacuum the air having been drawn from the spaces conse- quently heat could not escape from the transparent head piece nor could the cold come in from the back of this head gear a flexible tube led into the interior this tube being connected to a small com- pressed oxygen tank which the professor strapped to my back he then placed the wonder machine with its row of buttons on my chest and connected the six wires to the arms and other parts of my body professor martyn grasped my hand then and said in his firm quiet voice then goodbye kirby for awhile press the first button when you are ready to go may the fates be with you the professor next placed the transparent head gear over my head and secured it with attachments to my vacuum suit a strange feeling of quietness and solitude came over me while i could still see the professor i could hear him talk no longer as sounds cannot pierce a vacuum once more the professor shook my hand warmly then somehow i found myself pressing down the uppermost of three buttons instantly there was a tingling electric flash all through my body martyn trees distant buildings all seemed to shoot away into nothingness almost in panic i pushed the middle button i stopped i could not help it for this disappearing of all my world acted upon my consciousness i had a strange feeling that i was leaving forever i looked down and professor martyn a tiny speck in an automobile far below waved up to me cheerfully as he started his car and began to speed away he was fleeing the immediate danger of my growth when my feet would begin to cover an im- mense area until i could be almost entirely in space i gathered my cpurage quickly fiercely and pressed the top button again once more the earth began to get smaller little by little but faster a ting- ling sensation was all over me exhilarating if al- most painful where the wires were connected upon my forearms my legs about the forehead and upon my chest it did never seem as though i was changing but rather that the world was shrinking away faster and faster the clouds were falling upon me with threatening swiftness until my head broke suddenly through them and my body was obscured and the earth below save tiny glimpses as though of a dis- tant landscape through a fog far away i could see a few tall crags that broke through even as had i scorning from their majestic height the world be- low now indeed if never before was my head among the clouds but even the clouds were going i began to get an idea of the earth as a great ball of thick cloud there was a pricking sensation beneath my feet as though i stood upon pine needles it gave me a feeling of power to know that these were trees and hills i began to feel insecure as though my support were doing something stealthy beneath me have you ever seen an elephant perform upon a little roll- ing ball well that is how i felt the earth was rotating while i no longer could move upon it while i pondered watching in some alarm as it be- came more and more like a little ball a few feet thick it took matters in its own hand my feet slipped off suddenly and i was lying absolutely motionless powerless to move in space i watched the earth awhile as it shrank and even observed it now as it moved about the sun i could see other planets that had grown at first a trifle larger and were now getting smaller again about the same size as the earth tiny balls of no the man from the atom  more than a couple of inches in diameter    it was getting much darker the sun no longer gave much light for there was no atmosphere to diffuse it it was a great blinding ball of fire near my feet now and the planets were traveling about it swiftly i could see the light reflected on one side dark on the other on each planet the sun could be seen to move perceptibly too though very slightly as my feet grew larger threatening to touch it i hastily drew them up with ease and hung suspended in the sky in a half-sitting position as i grew turning my head away all at once i observed in some surprise that some of the stars were grow- ing larger coming nearer and nearer for a time i watched their swift approach but they gradually seemed to be getting smaller rather than larger i looked again at my own system to my amazement it had moved what seemed about a yard from its former position and was much smaller the planets i saw no longer but there were faint streaks of light in circles about the sun and i understood that these were the tracks of the worlds that now moved about their parent too swiftly to be followed with the eye i could see all the stars moving hither and yon now although they still continued to appear closer and closer together i found a number lying prac- tically on the plane of my chest but above that they seemed to cease i could now see no planets only the tiny sun moving farther and farther faster and faster along its path i could discern it seemed to me a trend in its and its companions path for on one side they seemed to be going one way and the opposite way on the other in front they seemed to move across my vision gradually i came to un- derstand that this was a great circle swinging vast- ly about me faster and faster i had grown until the stars were circling now about my legs i seemed to be the center of a huge vortex and they were coming closer and closer together as though to hem me about yet i could not move all of me away i could only move my limbs and head in relation to my stationary body the nearest star a tiny bright speck was a few yards away my own sun was like a bright period upon a blackboard but the stars were coming nearer and nearer it seemed necessary for me to move somehow so i drew my legs up and shot them out with all my force i began to move slowly away having acted upon what little material sub- stance there was in the ether the stars were soon only a few feet apart below me then a few inches and suddenly looking out beyond them i was struck with the fact that they seemed to be a great group isolated from a number of far distant blotches that were apart from these the stars were moving with incredible swiftness now about a center near which was what i imagined to be the sun though i had lost track of it somehow they merged closer and closer together the vast group shrunk more and more until finally they had become indistinguishable as entities they were all part of a huge cloud now that seemed somehow familiar what did it suggest it was pale dif- fused at the ends but thick and white in the center like a nebul--a nebula that was it a great light broke over me all these stars were part of a great system that formed a nebula it explained the mys- tery of the nebulae and there were now other nebulae approaching as this grew smaller they took on the resemblance of stars and they began to repeat the process of closing in as the stars had done the stars uni- verses within universes and those universes but nebulae in another great universe suddenly i be- gan to wonder could there be nothing more in infinity than universe after universe each a part of another greater one so it would seem yet the spell was upon me and i was not ready to admit such simplicity yet i must go on and my earth it could not even be found this sphere that had itself seemed almost the universe but my growth was terribly fast now the other nebulae were merging it would seem at first upon me but my slow progress through space became faster as i grew larger and even as they came upon me like flying arrows now i shot above them then they too merged the result was a vast nucleus of glowing material a great light began to grow all about me above i suddenly observed far away a huge brightness that seemed to extend all over the universe but it began definitely it was as though one were in a great ball and the nebulae a sunlike body now were in the center but as i became- larger with every instant the roof-like thing diffused even as before things had converged and formed into separ- ate bodies like stars i passed through them final- ly and they came together again behind me as i shot away another great body a coincidence suddenly struck me was not this system of a great ball effect with a nucleus within similar to what the atom was said to be could the nucleus and its great shell be opposite poles of electrical energy then in other words was this an electron -- a huge electron composed of univer- ses the idea was terrible in its magnitude some- thing too huge for comprehension and so i grew on many more of these electrons if such they were gathered together but my luck held and i passed beyond this new body thus formed --a molecule i wondered suddenly i tired of the endless procession of stars coming together form- ing ever into new stars that came together too i was getting homesick i wanted to see human faces about me again to be rid of this fantastic nightmare it was unreal it was impossible it must stop a sudden impulse of fear took hold upon me this should not go on forever i had to see my earth again all at once i reached down and pressed the central button to stop but just as a swiftly moving vehicle may not stop at once so could not i the terrific momentum of my growth carried me on and the machine moved still though slower the stars seemed shoot- ing upon me closing about me i could see no end of them before me i must stop or they would be about me closer in they came but smaller and smaller they became a thousand pinpoints shooting about me they merged into a thick tenuous cloud about me thicker and thicker i was shooting up now but my growth had stopped the cloud became a cold clammy thing that yielded to the touch and--  amazing stories and it was water yes pure water and i was floating in it    years suddenly i shot up out of the water and fell back strength returned to me and warmth and love of life it was water something i knew some- thing familiar a friend and so i swam swam on and on until my feet touched bottom and i was leaping forth out of the water on to the sand    iv there is no need to drag the tale out i awoke finally from an exhausted sleep and found myself in a world that was strange yet familiar it might have been a lonely part of the earth except for an atmosphere of strangeness that told me subcon- sciously it was another world there was a sun but it was far distant no larger than my moon and vast clouds of steam hung over the jungles be- yond the sand obscuring them in a shimmering fog obscuring the sun so that it danced and glim- mered hazily through the curtain and a perpetual twilight thus reigned i tried to tell myself i was in some strange man- ner home but i knew i was not at last break- ing beneath the weight of homesickness and regret i surrendered to a fit of weeping that shamed my manhood even as i wept then a mood of terrible unreasoning anger against fate enveloped me and i stormed here and there about the beach and so all through the night i alternately wept and raged and when the dawn came i sank again in peaceful slumber    when i awoke i was calm obviously in stop- ping i told myself i had been left in a cloud of atoms that proved to be part of another group of matter another earth or atom as you will the particular atoms i was in were part of the ocean the only thing to do was to return i was asham- ed of my madness now for i had the means of re- turn in the third button    the bottom button i saw no reason for delay i splashed back into the water and swam hastily out to the point where it seemed i had risen  i pushed the lowest button slowly i felt myself grow smaller and smaller the sense of suffocation returned only to pass away as the pinpoints shot about me again but away this time the whole nightmare was repeated now re- versed for everything seemed to be opening up be- fore me i thrilled with joy as i thought of my re- turn to my home and the professor again all the world was friend to me now in my thoughts a friend i could not bear to lose and then all my hopes were dashed how i thought could i strike my own earth again for even if i had come to the right spot in the water to a certainty how could i be sure i would pass be- tween just the right cloud of molecules and what would lead me to the very electron i had left and after the nucleus why should i not enter the wrong nebula and even if i should hit the right nebula how should i find my own star my own earth it was hopeless impossible    and yet so consti- tuted is human nature that i could hope neverthe- less my god impossible as it is i did it i am cer- tain that it was my own nebula i entered and i was in the center where the sun should be it sounds fantastic it is fantastic the luck of a lifetime an infinity for me or so it should have been but i looked where the sun ought to be found in the cen- tral cluster i halted early and watched long with a sinking heart but the sun--was gone i lay motionless in the depths of space and i watched idly the stars that roamed here and there black despair was in my heart but it was a despair so terrible that i could not comprehend its awful- ness it was beyond human emotion and i was dazed perhaps even a little mad the stars were tiny pinpoints of light and they shot back and forth and all around like purposeless nothings and ever would they collide and a great- er pinpoint would be born or a thousand pieces of fragments would result or the two might start off on new tracks only to collide again seconds it took them to cover what i knew to be billions of trillions of light-years and gradually the truth dawned upon me the awful truth these stars were suns even as mine had been and they grew and died and were reborn it seemed now in a second all in a second yet fair races bloomed and died and worlds lived and died races of intelligent beings strove only to die all in a second but it was not a second to them my immense size was to blame on my part for time is relative and depends upon size the smaller a creature the shorter its life and yet to itself the fly that lives but a day has passed a life- time of years so it was here because i had grown large centuries had become but moments to me and the faster the larger i grew the swifter the years the millions of years had rolled away i re- membered how i had seen the streaks that meant the planets going about the sun so fast had they revolved that i could not see the circuit that meant but a second to me and yet each incredibly swift revolution had been a year a year on earth a second to me and so on an immensely greater scale had it been as i grew the few minutes that meant to me the sun's movement through the ether of what seemed a yard had been centuries to the earth before i had lived ten minutes of my strange existence professor martyn had vainly hoped away a lifetime and died in bitter despair men had come and died races had flourished and fallen per- haps all mankind had died away from a world strip- ped of air and water in ten minutes of my life   and so i sit here now pining hopelessly for my mother earth this strange planet of a strange star is all beyond my ken the men are strange and their customs curious their language is beyond my every effort to comprehend yet mine they know like a book i find myself a savage a creature to be treated with pity and contempt in a world too advanced even for his comprehension nothing here means anything to me i live here on sufferance as an ignorant african might have lived in an incomprehensible to him london a strange creature to play with and to be played with by children a clown  a savage     and yearn as i will for my earth i know i may never know it again for it was gone forgotten non-existent a trillion centuries ago    the end of part one the thing from-outside by  george allen england    out of the door crept something like a man a queer broken bent-over thing a thing crippled shrunken and flabby that whined this thine--yes it was still marr--crunched down at one side quivering whimpering it moved its hands as a crushed ant moves its antennae jerkily without significance   they sat about their camp-fire that little party of americans retreating southward from hudson bay before the on-coming menace of the great cold sat there stolid under the awe of the north under the uneasiness that the day's trek had laid upon their souls the three men smoked the two women huddled close to each other fireglow picked their faces from the gloom of night among the dwarf firs a splashing murmur told of the albany river's haste to escape from the wilderness and reach the bay i don't see what there was in a mere circular print on a rock- ledge to make our guides desert said professor thorburn his voice was as dry as his whole personality most extraordi- nary they knew what it was all right answered jandron geol- ogist of the party so do i he rubbed his cropped mustache his eyes glinted grayly i've seen prints like that before that was on the labrador and i've seen things happen where they were something surely happened to our guides be- fore they'd got a mile into the bush put in the professor's wife while vivian her sister gazed into the fire that revealed her as a beauty not to be spoiled even by a tam and a rough-knit sweater men don't shoot wild- ly and scream like that un- less-- they're all three dead now anyhow put in jandron so they're out of harm's way while we--well we're two hundred and fifty wicked miles from the c p r rails forget it jandy said marr the journalist we're just suf- fering from an attack of nerves that's all give me a fill of baccy thanks we'll all be bet- ter in the morning ho-hum now speaking of spooks and such-- he launched into an account of how he had once exposed a fraudulent spiritualist thus proving--to his own satisfaction--that nothing existed beyond the scope of mankind's everyday life but nobody gave him much heed and silence here is an extraordinary story by the well-known magazine writer george allan england this story should be read quite care- fully and it is necessary to use one's imagination in reading it the theme of mr england's story is unusual and extraordinary if we can take insects and put them upon the dissecting table in order to study their anatomy is there a good reason why some super-intelligence cannot do the same thing with us humans it may be taken as a certainty that intelligence as we understand it is not only of our earth it is also not necessary to presume that intelligence may have its setting only in a body of flesh and blood there is no reason for disbelieving that a super-intelligence might not reside in gases or invisible structures something which we of today cannot even imagine   amazing stories fell upon the little night-encampment in the wilds a silence that was ominous pale cold stars watched down from spaces in- finitely far beyond man's trivial world next day stopping for chow on a ledge miles up- stream jandron discovered another of the prints he cautiously summoned the other two men they examined the print while the women-folk were busy by the fire a harmless thing the marking seemed only a ring about four inches in diameter a kind of cup-shaped depression with a raised center a sort of glaze coated it as if the granite had been fused by heat jandron knelt a well-knit figure in bright macki- naw and canvas leggings and with a shaking finger explored the smooth curve of the print in the rock his brows contracted as he studied it we'd better get along out of this as quick as we can said he in an unnatural voice you've got your wife to protect thorburn and i--well i've got vivian and-- you have nipped marr the light of an evil jealously gleamed in his heavy-lidded look what you need is an alienist really jandron the professor admonished you mustn't let your imagination run away with you i suppose it's imagination that keeps this print cold the geologist retorted his breath made faint swirling coils of vapor above it nothing but a pot-hole judged thorburn bend- ing his spare angular body to examine the print the professor's vitality all seemed centered in his big-bulged skull that sheltered a marvellous think- ing machine now he put his lean hand to the base of his brain rubbing the back of his head as if it ached then under what seemed some power- ful compulsion he ran his bony finger around the print in the rock by jove but it is cold he admitted and looks as if it had been stamped right out of the stone extraordinary dissolved out you mean corrected the geolo- gist by cold the journalist laughed mockingly wait till i write this up he sneered noted geologist declares frigid ghost dissolves gran- ite  jandron ignored him he fetched a little water from the river and poured it into the print ice ejaculated the professor solid ice frozen in a second added jandron while marr frankly stared and it'll never melt either i tell you i've seen some of tnese rings before and every time horrible things have happened incred- ible things something burned this ring out of the stone--burned it out with the cold interstellar space something that can import cold as a perma- nent quality of matter something that can kill matter and totally remove it of course that's all sheer poppycock the jour- nalist tried to laugh but his brain felt numb this something this thing continued jandron is a thing that can't be killed by bullets it's what caught our guides on the barrens as they ran away--poor fools a shadow fell across the print in the rock mrs thorburn had come up was standing there she had overheard a little of what jandron had beeri saying nonsense she tried to exclaim but she waa shivering so she could hardly speak that night after a long afternoon of paddling and portaging--laboring against inhibitions like those in a nightmare--they camped on shelving rocks that slanted to the river after all said the professor when supper was done we mustn't get into a panic i know extra- ordinary things are reported from the wilderness and more than one man has come out raving but we by jove with our superior brains--we aren't going to let nature play us any tricks and of course added his wife her arm about vivian everything in the universe is a natural force there's really no super-natural at all admitted jandron replied but how about things outside the universe and they call you a scientist gibed marr but the professor leaned forward his brows knit hm he grunted a little silence fell you don't mean realty asked vivian that you think there's life and intelligence--outside jandron looked at the girl her beauty haloed with ruddy gold from the firelight was a pain to him as he answered yes i do and dangerous life too i know what i've seen in the north country i know what i've seen silence again save for the crepitation of the flames the fall of an ember the murmur of the current darkness narrowed the wilderness to just that circle of flickering light ringed by the forest and the river brooded over by the pale stars of course you can't expect a scientific man to take you seriously commented the professor i know what i've seen i tell you there's some- thing entirely outside man's knowledge poor fellow scoffed the journalist but even as he spoke his hand pressed his forehead there are things at work jandron affirmed with dogged persistence he lighted his pipe with a blazing twig its flame revealed his face drawn lined things things that reckon with us no more than we do with ants less perhaps the flame of the twig died night stood closer watching suppose there are the girl asked what's that got to do with these prints in the rock they answered jandran are marks left by one of those things footprints maybe that thing is near us here and now marr's laugh broke a long stillness and you he exclaimed with an a m and a b s to write after your name if you knew more retorted jandron you'd know a devilish sight less it's only ignorance that's cock-sure but dogmatized the professor no scientist of any standing has ever admitted any outside inter- ference with this planet no and for thousands of years nobody ever ad- mitted that the world was round either what i've seen i know well what have you seen asked mrs thor- burn shivering you'll excuse me please for not going into that just now the thing from--outside  you mean the professor demanded dryly if the--hm--this suppositious thing wants to-- it'll do any infernal thing it takes a fancy to yes if it happens to want us-- but what could things like that want of us why should they come here at all oh for various reasons for inanimate objects at times and then again for living beings they've come here lots of times i tell you jandron as- serted with strange irritation and got what they wanted and then gone away to--somewhere if one of them happens to want us for any reason it will take us that's all if it doesn't want us it will ignore us as we'd ignore gorillas in africa if we were looking for gold but if it was gorilla- fur we wanted that would be different for the gorillas wouldn't it what in the world asked vivian could a-- well a thing from outside want of us what do men want say of guinea-pigs men experiment with em of course superior beings use inferior for their own ends to assume that man is the supreme product of evolution is gross self-conceit might not some superior thing want to experiment with human beings  but how demanded marr the human brain is the most highly-organized form of matter known to this planet suppose now-- nonsense interrupted the professor all hands to the sleeping-bags and no more of this i've got a wretched headache let's anchor in blan- ket bay he and both the women turned in jandron and marr sat a while longer by the fire they kept plenty of wood piled on it too for an unnatural chill transfixed the night-air the fire burned strangely blue with greenish flicks of flame at length after vast acerbities of disagreement the geologist and the newspaperman sought their sleeping-bags the fire was a comfort not that a fire could avail a pin's weight against a thing from interstellar space but subjectively it was a comfort the instincts of a million years center- ing around protection by fire cannot be obliterated after a time--worn out by a day of nerve-strain and of battling with swift currents of flight from something invisible intangible--they all slept the depths of space star-sprinkled hung above them with vastness immeasurable cold beyond all understanding of the human mind jandron woke first in a red dawn he blinked at the fire as he crawled from his sleeping-bag the fire was dead and yet it had not burned out much wood remained unconsumed charred over as if some gigantic extinguisher had in the night been lowered over it hmmm growled jandron he glanced about him on the ledge prints too i might have known he aroused marr despite all the jouralist's mocking hostility jandron felt more in common with this man of his own age than with the pro- fessor who was close on sixty look here now said he it has been all around here see it put out our fire--maybe the fire an- noyed it some way--and it walked round us every- where his gray eyes smouldered i guess by gad you've got to admit facts now the journalist could only shiver and stare lord what a head i've got on me this morning he chattered he rubbed his forehead with a shak- ing hand and started for the river most of his assurance had vanished he looked badly done up well what say demanded jandron see these fresh prints damn the prints retorted marr and fell to grumbling some unintelligible thing he washed unsteadily and remained crouching at the river's lip inert numbed jandron despite a gnawing at the base of his brain carefully examined the ledge he found prints scattered everywhere and some even on the river-bottom near the shore wherever water had collected in the prints on the rock it had frozen hard each print in the river-bed too was white with ice ice that the rushing current could not melt well by gad he exclaimed he lighted his pipe and tried to think horribly afraid--yes he felt horribly afraid but determined presently as a little power of concentration came back he noticed that all the prints were in straight lines each mark about two feet from the next it was observing us while we slept said jan- dron what nonsense are you talking eh demanded marr his dark heavy face sagged fire now and grub he got up and shuffled unsteadily away from the river then he stopped with a jerk staring look look a that axe he gulped pointing jandron picked up the axe by the handle taking good care not to touch the steel the blade was white-furred with frost and deep into it punching out part of the edge one of the prints was stamped this metal said he is clean gone it's been absorbed the thing doesn't recognize any differ- ence in materials water and steel and rock are all the same to it you're crazy snarled the journalist how could a thing travel on one leg hopping along mak- ing marks like that it could roll if it was disk-shaped and-- a cry from the professor turned them thor- burn was stumbling toward them hands out and tremulous my wife-- he choked vivian was kneeling beside her sister frightened dazed something's happened stammered the profes- sor here-- come here-- mrs thorburn was beyond any power of theirs to help she was still breathing but her respira- tions were stertorous and a complete paralysis had stricken her her eyes half-open and expression- less showed pupils stai'tlingly dilated no resources of the party's drug-kit produced the slightest effect on the woman the next half-hour was a confused panic break- ing camp getting mrs thorburn into a canoe and leaving that accursed place with a furious energy of terror that could no longer reason up-stream ever up against the swirl of the current the party fought driven by horror with no thought of food or drink paying no heed to landmarks lashed for- ward only by the mad desire to be gone the three  amazing stories men and the girl flung every ounce of their energy into the paddles their panting breath mingled with the sound of swirling eddies a mist-blurred sun brooded over the northern wilds unheeded hosts of black-flies sang high-pitched keenings all about the fugitives on either hand the forest waited watched only after two hours of sweating toil had brought exhaustion did they stop in the shelter of a cove where black waters circled foam-flecked there they found the professor's wife--she was dead nothing remained to do but bury her at first thorburn would not hear of it like a madman he insisted that through all hazards he would fetch the body out but no--impossible so after a ter- rible time he yielded in spite of her grief vivian was admirable she undei'stood what must be done it was her voice that said the prayers her hand that--lacking flowers--laid the fir boughs on the cairn the pro- fessor was dazed past doing anything saying any- thing toward mid-afternoon the party landed again many miles up-river necessity fox-ced them to eat fire would not burn every time they lighted it it smouldered and went out with a heavy greasy smoke the fugitives ate cold food and drank water then shoved off in two canoes and once more fled in the third canoe hauled to the edge of the forest lay all the rock-specimens data and curios scientific instrumexxts the party kept only marr's diax'y a compass supplies fire-arms and medicine- kit we can find the things we've left--sometime said jandron noting the place well sometime-- after it has gone and bring the body out added thox-buxn tears for the first time wet his eyes vivian said nothing marr tried to light his pipe he seemed to forget that nothing not even tobacco would burn now vivian and jandron occupied one canoe the other carried the professor and marr thus the power of the two canoes was about the same they kept well together up-stream the fugitives paddled and portaged with a dumb desperate energy toward evening they struck into what they believed to be the mamattawan a mile up this as the blurred sun faded beyond a wilder- ness of ominous silence they camped here they made determined efforts to kindle fix-e not even alcohol from the drug-kit would start it cold they mumbled a little food cold they huddled into their sleeping-bags there to lie with darkness leaden on their fear after a long time up over a world void of all sound save the river-flow slid an amber moon notched by the ragged tops of the conifers even the wail of a timber-wolf would have come as wel- come relief but no wolf howled silence and night enfolded them and evexy- whex-e they felt that it was watching foolishly enough as a man will do foolish things in a crisis jandron laid his revolver outside his sleeping-bag in easy reach his thought--blurred by a strange drawing headache--was if it touches vivian i'll shoot he realized the complete absurdity of trying to shoot a visitant from interstellar space from the fourth dimension maybe but jandron's ideas seemed tangled nothing would come right he lay there absorbed in a kind of waking night- mare now and then rising on an elbow he hearkened all in vain nothing so much as stix-red his thought drifted to better days when all had been health sanity optimism when nothing except jealousy of marr as concerned vivian had troubled him days when the sizzle of the frying-pan over friendly coals had made friendly wilderness music when the wind and the northern star the whirr of the reel the whispering vortex of the paddle in clear water had all been things of joy yes and when a certain happy moment had through some word or look of the girl seemed to piromise his heart's desire but now-- damn it i'll save her anyhow he swore with savage intensity knowing all the while that what was to be would be unmitigably do ants by any waving of antennae stay the down-crushing foot of man next morning and the next no sign of the thing appeared hope revived that possibly it might have flitted away elsewhere back perhaps to outer space many were the miles the urging paddles spurned behind the fugitives calculated that a week more would bring them to the railroad fire burned again hot food and drink helped wonder- fully but where were the fish  most extraordinary all at once said the pro- fessor at noonday camp he had become quite rational again do you realize jandron we've seen no traces of life in some time the geologist nodded only too clearly he had noted just that but he had been keeping still about it that's so too chimed in marr enjoying the smoke that some incomprehensible turn of events was letting him have not a muskrat or beaver not even a squirrel or bird not so much as a gnat or black-fly the pro- fessor added jandron suddenly realized that he would have welcomed even those that afternoon marr fell into a suddenly vile temper he mumbled curses against the guides the current the portages everything the pro- fessor seemed more cheerful vivian complained of an oppressive headache jandron gave her the last of the aspirin tablets and as he gave them took her hand in his i'll see you through anyhow said he i don't count now nobody counts only you she gave him a long silent look he saw the sudden glint of tears in her eyes telt the pressure of her hand and knew they two had never been so near each other as in that moment under the shadow of the unknown next day--or it may have been two days later for none of them could be quite sure about the passage of time--they came to a deserted lumber- camp even more than two days might have passed because now their bacon was all gone and only coffee tobacco beef-cubes and pilot-bread re- mained the lack of fish and game ixad cut alarm- ingly into the duflle-bag that day--whatever day it may have been--all four of them suffered terribly from headache of an odd ring-shaped kind as if something circular were being pressed down about their heads the professor said it was the sun that the thing from--outside  made his head ache vivian laid it to the wind and the gleam of the swift water while marr claimed it was the heat jandron wondered at all this inasmuch as he plainly saw that the river had almost stopped flowing and the day had become still and overcast they dragged their canoes upon a rotting stage of fir-poles and explored the lumber-camp a mourn- ful place set back in an old slash now partly over- grown with scrub poplar maple and birch the log buildings covered with tar-paper partly torn from the pole roofs were of the usual north coun- try type obviously the place had not been used for years even the landing-stage where once logs had been rolled into the stream had sagged to decay i don't quite get the idea of this marr ex- claimed where did the logs go to downstream of course but that would take em to hudson bay and there's no market for spruce timber or pulp- wood at hudson bay he pointed down the cur- rent you're entirely mistaken put in the professor any fool could see this river runs the other way a log thrown in here would go down toward the st lawrence but then asked the girl why can't we drift back to civilization  the professor retorted just what we have been doing all along ex- traordinary that i have to explain the obvious he walked away in a huff i don't know but he's right at that half ad- mitted the journalist i've been thinking almost the same thing myself the past day or two--that is ever since the sun shifted what do you mean shifted from jandron you haven't noticed it but there's been no sun at all for at least two days hanged if i'll waste time arguing with a luna- tic  marr growled he vouchsafed no explanation of what he meant by the sun's having shifted but wandered off grumbling what are we going to do the girl appealed to jandron the sight of her solemn frightened eyes of her palm-outward hands and at last her very feminine fear constricted jandron's heart we're going through you and i he answered simply we've got to save them from themselves you and i have their hands met again and for a moment held despite the dead calm a fir-tip at the edge of the clearing suddenly flicked aside shrivelled as if frozen but neither of them saw it the fugitives badly spent established themselves in the bar-room or sleeping-shack of the camp they wanted to feel a roof over them again if only a broken one the traces of men comforted them a couple of broken peavies a pair of snowshoes with the thongs all gnawed off a cracked bit of mirror a yellowed almanac dated  jandron called the professor's attention to this almanac but the professor thrust it aside what do i want of a canadian census-report he demanded and fell to counting the bunks over and over again his big bulge of his forehead that housed the massive brain of him was oozing sweat marr cursed what he claimed was sunshine through the holes in the roof though jandron could see none claimed the sunshine made his head ache but it's not a bad place he added we can make a blaze in that fireplace and be comfy i don't like that window though what window asked jandron where marr laughed and ignored him jandron turned to vivian who had sunk down on the deacon-seat and was staring at the stove is there a window here he demanded don't ask me she whispered i--i don't know with a very thriving fear in his heart jandron peered at her a moment he fell to muttering i'm wallace jandron wallace jandron  ware street cambridge massachusetts i'm quite sane and i'm going to stay so i'm going to save her i know perfectly well what i'm doing and i'm sane quite quite sane after a time of confused and purposeless wrang- ling they got a fire going and made coffee this and cube bouillon with hardtack helped consider- ably the camp helped too a house even a poor and broken one is a wonderful barrier against a thing from--outside presently darkness folded down the men smoked thankful that tobacco still held out vivian lay in a bunk that jandron had piled with spruce boughs for her and seemed to sleep the professor fretted like a child over the blisters his paddle had made upon his hands marr laughed now and then though what he might be laughing at was not ap- parent suddenly he broke out after all what should it want of us our brains of course the professor answered sharply that lets jandron out the journalist mocked but added the professor i can't imagine a thing callously destroying human beings and yet-- he stopped short with surging memories of his dead wife what was it jandron asked that destroyed all those people in valladolid spain that time so many of em died in a few minutes after having been touched by an invisible something that left a slight red mark on each the newspapers were full of it piffle yawned marr i tell you insisted jandron there are forms of life as superior to us as we are to ants we can't see em no ant ever saw a man and did any ant ever form the least conception of a man these things have left thousands of traces all over the world if i had my reference-books-- tell that to the marines charles fort the greatest authority in the world on unexplained phenomena persisted jandron gives innumerable cases of happenings that science can't explain in his book of the damned he claims this earth was once a no-man's land where all kinds of things explored and colonized and fought for possession and he says that now every- body's warned off except the owners i happen to remember a few sentences of his in the past inhabitants of a host of worlds have dropped here hopped here wafted here sailed flown motored walked here have come singly have come in enor- mous numbers have visited for hunting trading mining they have been unable to stay here have made colonies here have been lost here  amazing stories poor fish to believe that mocked the jour- nalist while the professor blinked and rubbed his bulging forehead i do believe it insisted jandron the world is covered with relics of dead civilizations that have mysteriously vanished leaving nothing but their temples and monuments rubbish how about easter island how about all the gigantic works there and in a thousand other places --peru yucatan and so on--which certainly no primitive race ever built that's thousands of years ago said marr and i'm sleepy for heaven's sake can it oh all right but how explain things then what the devil could one of those things want of our brains suddenly put in the professor after all what well what do we want of lower forms of life sometimes food again some product or other or just information maybe it is just experiment- ing with us the way we poke an ant-hill there's always this to remember that the human brain- tissue is the most highly-organized form of matter in this world yes admitted the professor but what-- t might want brain-tissue for food for experi- mental purposes for lubricant--how do i know jandron fancied he was still explaining things but all at once he found himself waking up in one of the bunks he felt terribly cold stiff sore a sift of snow lay here and there on the camp floor where it had fallen through holes in the roof vivian he croaked hoarsely thorburn marr nobody answered there was nobody to answer jandron crawled with immense pain out of his bunk and blinked round with bleary eyes all of a sud- den he saw the professor and gulped the professor was lying stiff and straight in another bunk on his back his waxen face made a mask of horror the open staring eyes with pupils immensely dilated sent jandron shuddering back a livid ring marked the forehead that now sagged inward as if empty vivian croaked jandron staggering away from the body he fumbled to the bunk where the girl had lain the bunk was quite deserted on the stove in which lay half-charred wood-- wood smothered out as if by some noxious gas-- still stood the coffee-pot the liquid in it was frozen solid of vivian and the journalist no trace re- mained along one of the sagging beams that supported the roof jandron's horror-blasted gaze perceived a straight line of frosted prints ring-shaped bitten deep vivian vivian no answer shaking sick gray half-blind with a horror not of this world jandron peered slowly around the duffle-bag and supplies were gone nothing was left but that coffee-pot and the revolver at jandron's hip jandron turned then a-stare his skull feeling empty as a burst drum he crept lamely to the door and out--out into the snow snow it came slanting down from a gray sky it steadily filtered the trees showed no leaf birches poplars rock-maples all stood naked only the conifers drooped sickly-green in a little shal- low across the river snow lay white on thin ice ice snow rapt with terror jandron stared why then he must have been unconscious three or four weeks but how-- suddenly all along the upper branches of trees that edged the clearing puffs of snow flicked down the geologist shuffled after two half-obliterated sets of footprints that wavered toward the landing his body was leaden he wheezed as he reached the river the light dim as it was hurt his eyes he blinked in a confusion that could just perceive one canoe was gone he pressed a hand to his head where an iron band seemed screwed up tight tighter vivian marr halloooo not even an echo silence clamped the world silence and a cold that gnawed everything had gone a sinister gray after a certain time--though time now possessed neither reality nor duration--jandron dragged him- self back to the camp and stumbled in heedless of the staring corpse he crumpled down by the stove and tried to think but his brain had been emptied of power everything blent to a gray blur snow kept slithering in through the roof well why don't you come and get me thing suddenly snarled jandron here i am damn you come and get me voices suddenly he heard voices yes some- body was outside there singularly aggrieved ho got up and limped to the door he squinted out intcf the gray saw two figures down by the landing with numb indifference he recognized the girl and marr why should they bother me again he nebu- lously wondered can't they go away and leave me alone he felt peevish irritation then a modicum of reason returning he sensed that they were arguing vivian beside a canoe freshly dragged from thin ice was pointing marr was gesticulating all at once marr snarled turned from her plodded with bent back toward the camp but listen she called her rough-knit sweater all powdered with snow that's the way she gestured downstream i'm not going either way marr retorted fra going to stay right here he came on bareheaded snow grayed his stubble of beard but on his head it melted as it fell as if some fever there had raised the brain-stuff to improbable temperatures i'm going to stay right here all summer his heavy lids sagged puffy and evil his lips showed a glint of teeth let me alone vivian lagged after him kicking up the ash-like snow with indifference jandron watched them trivial human creatures suddenly marr saw him in the doorway and stopped short he drew his gun he aimed at jandron you get out he mouthed why in -- can't you stay dead put that gun down you idiot jandron managed to retort the girl stopped and seemed trying to understand we can get away yet if we all stick together are you going to get out and leave me alone the thing from--outside  demanded the journalist holding his gun steadily enough jandron wholly indifferent watched the muzzle vague curiosity possessed him just what he won- dered did it feel like to be shot marr pulled trigger snap the cartridge missed fire not even powder would burn marr laughed horribly and shambled forward serves him right he mouthed he'd better not come back again jandron understood that marr had seen him fall but still he felt himself standing there alive he shuffled away from the door no matter whether he was alive or dead there was always vivian to be saved the journalist came to the door paused looked down grunted and passed into the camp he shut the door jandron heard the rotten wooden bar of the latch drop from within echoed a laugh monstrous in its brutality then quivering the geologist felt a touch on his arm why did you desert us like that he heard vivian's reproach why he turned hardly able to see her at all listen he said thickly i'll admit anything it's all right but just forget it for now we've got to get out o here the professor is dead in there and marr's gone mad and barricaded himself in there so there's no use staying there's a chance for us yet come along he took her by the arm and tried to draw her toward the river but she held back the hate in her face sickened him he shook in the grip of a mighty chill go with--you she demanded yes by god he retorted in a swift blaze of anger or i'll kill you where you stand it shan't get you anyhow swiftly piercing a greater cold smote to his inner marrows a long row of the cup-shaped prints had just appeared in the snow beside the camp and from these marks wafted a faint bluish vapor of unthinkable cold what are you staring at the girl demanded those prints in the snow there--see he pointed a shaking finger how can there be snow at this season  he could have wept for the pity of her the love of her on her red tam her tangle of rebel hair her sweater the snow came steadily drifting yet there she stood before him and prated of summer jandron heaved himself out of a very slough of down-dragging lassitudes he whipped himself into action summer winter--no matter he flung at her you're coming along with me he seized her arm with the brutality of desperation that must hurt to save and murder too lay in his soul he knew that he would strangle her with his naked hands if need were before he would ever leave her there for it to work its horrible will upon you come with me he mouthed or by the almighty-- marr's scream in the camp whirled him toward the door that scream rose higher higher even more and more piercing just like the screams of the runaway indian guides in what now appeared the infinitely long ago it seemed to last hours and always it rose rose as if being wrung out of a human body by some kind of agony not conceivable in this world higher higher-- then it stopped jandron hurled himself against the plank doox the bar smashed the door shivered inward with a cry jandron recoiled he covered his eyes with a hand that quivered claw-like go away vivian don't come here--don't look-- he stumbled away babbling out of the door crept something like a man a queer broken bent over thing a thing crippled shrunken and flabby that whined this thing--yes it was still marr--crouched down at one side quivering whimpering it moved its hands as a crushed ant moves its antennas jerkily without

panting thousands dragging along hatless fans and parasols the sultry ven- geance of a real day of summer a day of bursting tires hot pavements and wrecked endeavor heart- aches for the seashore for leafy bowers beside rip- pling water a day of broken hopes and listless am- bition perhaps fate chose the day because of its heat and because of its natural benefit on fecundity we have no way of knowing but we do know this the date the time the meeting the boy with the burn- ing glass and the old doctor so commonplace so trivial and hidden in obscurity who would have guessed it yet it is--after the creation--one of the most important dates in the world's history this is saying a whole lot let us go into it and see what it amounts to let us trace the thing out in history weigh it up and balance it with sequence of charley huyck we know nothing up to this day it is a thing which for some reason he has always kept hidden recent investigation as to his previous life and antecedents have availed us noth- ing perhaps he could have told us but as he has gone down as the world's great martyr there is no hope of gaining from his lips what we would so like to know after all it does not matter we have the day -- the incident and its purport and its climax of sequence to the day of the great disaster also we have the blasted moun- tains and the lake of blue water which will ever live with his memory his greatness is not of war- fare nor personal ambi- tion but of all mankind the wreaths that we be- stow upon him have no doubtful color the man who saved the earth from such a beginning charley huyck lean and frail of body with even then the wistfulness of the idealist and the eyes of a poet charley huyck the boy crossing the hot pavement with his pack of papers the much treasured piece of glass in his pocket and the sun which only he should master burning down upon him a moment out of the ages the turning of a straw destined to out-balance all the previous accumulation of man's history the sun was hot and burning and the child--he could not have been more than ten--cast a glance over his shoulder it was in the way of calcula- tion in the heyday of childhood he was not dragged down by the heat and weather he had the enthusi- asm of his half-score of years and the joy of the plaything we will not presume to call it the spirit of the scientist though it was perhaps the spark of latent investigation that was destined to lead so far a moment picked out of destiny a boy and a plaything uncounted millions of boys have played with glass and the sun rays who cannot remember the little round-burning dot in the palm of the hand and the subsequent exclamation charley huyck had found a new toy it was a simple thing and as old as glass fate will ever be so in her working and the doctor why should he have been wait- ing if it was not destiny it was at least an ac- cumulation of moment in the heavy eye-glasses the square close-cut beard and his uncompromis- ing fact-seeking expression those who knew dr robold are strong in the affirmation that he was the antithesis of all emotion he was the sternest prod- uct of science unbending hardened by experiment and caustic in his condemnation of the frailness of human nature it had been his one function to topple over the castles of the foolish with his hard-seeing wisdom he had spotted sophistry where we thought it not even into the castles of science he had gone like a juggernaut it is hard to have one's theories deri- ded--yea even for a scientist--and to be called a fool dr robold knew no middle languagehe was not relished by science his memory as we have it is that of an eccen- tric a man of slight compassion abrupt of man- ner and with no tact in speaking genius is often so it is a strange fact that many of the greatest of men have been denied by their fellows a great man and laughter he was not accepted none of us know today what it cost dr robold he was not the man to tell us perhaps charley huyck might but his lips are sealed forever we only know chat he retired to the mountain and of the subsequent flood of benefits that rained upon mankind and we still denied him the great cynic on the mountain of the secrets of the place we know little he was not the man to accept the investigator he despised the curious he had been laughed at -- let be -- he would work alone on the great moment of the future in the light of the past we may well bend knee to the doctor and his protg charley huyck two men and destiny whstt would we be without them one shudders to think a little thing and yet one of the greatest mo- ments in the world's history it must have been fate why was it that this stern man who hated all emotion should so have unbended at this mo- we read of the days when the powers of radium were yet unknown it is told us that burns were produced by incautiously carrying a tube of radium salts in the pocket and here in this story we are told of a different power opalescence due to an- other clement it can destroy mountains excavate cavi- ties of unmeasurable depths and kill human beings and animals in multitude the story opens with a poor little boy experimenting with a burning glass then he be- comes the hero of the story--he studies and eventually finds himself able to destroy the earth he exceeds archimedes in his power and he suddenly finds that he has unlocked a power that threatens this very de- struction and the story depicts his horror at the frankenstein which he had unloosed and tells of his wild efforts to save humanity and of the loss of the cosmic discoveries of the little newsboy grown up to be a great scientist  amazing stories ment that we cannot answer but we can conjec- ture mayhap it is this we were all wrong we accepted the man's exterior and profession as the fact of his marrow no man can lose all emotion the doctor was after all even as ourselves--he was human what- ever may be said we have the certainty of that mo- ment--and of charley huyck the sun's rays were hot they were burning the pavements were intolerable the baked air in the canyoned street was dancing like that of an oven a day of dog-days the boy crossing the street his arms full of papers and the glass bulging in his little hip-pocket at the curb he stopped with such a sun it was impossible to long forget his plaything he drew it carefully out of his pocket lay down a paper and began distancing his glass for the focus he did not notice the man beside him why should he the round dot the brownish smoke the red spark and the flash of flame he stamped upon it a moment out of boyhood an experimental miracle as old as the age of glass and just as delightful the boy had spoiled the name of a great governor of a great state but the paper was still salable he had had his moment mark that moment a hand touched his shoulder the lad leaped up yessir star or bulletin i'll take one of each said the man there now i was just watching you do you know what you were doing yessir burning paper startin fire that's the way the indians did it the man smiled at the perversion of fact there is not such a distance between sticks and glass in the age of childhood i know he said--the indians but do you know how it was done the why--why the paper began to blaze yessir all right explain the boy looked up at him he was a city boy and used to the streets here was some old high- brow challenging his wisdom of course he knew it's the sun there laughed the man of course you said you knew but you don't why doesn't the sun without the glass burn the paper tell me that the boy was still looking up at him he saw that the man was not like the others on the street it may be that the strange intimacy kindled into being at that moment certainly it was a strange unbending for the doctor it would if it was hot enough or you could get enough of it together ah then that is what the glass is for is it yessir concentration  con-- i don't know sir but it's the sun she's sure some hot i know a lot about the sun sir i've studied it with the glass the glass picks up all the rays and puts them in one hole and that's what burns the paper it's lots of fun i'd like to have a bigger one but it's all i've got why do you know if i had a glass big enough and a place to stand i'd burn up the earth the old man laughed why archimides i thought you were dead my name ain't archimedes it's charley huyck again the old man laughed oh is it well that's a good name too and if you keep on you'll make it famous as the name of the other wherein he was foretelling history where do you live the boy was still looking ordinarily he would not have told but he motioned back with his thumb i don't live i room over on brennan street oh i see you room where's your mother search me i never saw her i see and your father how do i know he went floating when i was four years old floating yessir--to sea so your mother's gone and your father's float- ing archimedes is adrift you go to school yessir what reader no reader sixth grade i see what school school twenty-six say it's hot i can't stand here all day i've got to sell my papers the man pulled out a purse i'll take the lot he said then kindly my boy i would like to have you go with me it was a strange moment a little thing with the fates looking on when destiny plays she picks strange moments this was one charley huyck went with dr robold chapter ii the poison pall we all of us remember that fatal day when the news startled all of oakland no one can forget it at first it read like a newspaper hoax in spite of the oft-proclaimed veracity of the press and we were inclined to laughter twixt wonder at the story and its impossibilities we were not a little enthused at the nerve of the man who put it over it was in the days of dry reading the world had grown populous and of well-fed content our soap-box artists had come to the point at last where they preached not disaster but a full-bellied thanks for the millennium that was here a period of utopian quietness--no villain around the corner no man to covet the ox of his neighbor quiet reading you'll admit those were the days of the millennium nothing ever happened here's hoping they never come again and then honestly we were not to blame for bestowing blessing out of our hearts upon that newspaperman even if it were a hoax it was at least something at high noon the clock in the city hall had just struck the hour that held the post twixt am and pm a hot day with a sky that was clear and azure a quiet day of serene peace and contentment a strange and a portent moment looking back and over the miracle we may conjecture that it was the clearness of the atmosphere and the brightness of the sun that helped to the impact of the disaster knowing what we know now we can appreciate the impulse of natural phenomena it was not a mir- acle the man who saved the earth  the spot fourteenth and broadway oakland california fortunately the thousands of employees in the stores about had not yet come out for their lunch- eons the lapse that it takes to put a hat on or to pat a ribbon saved a thousand lives one shudders to think of what would have happened had the spot been crowded even so it was too impossible and too terrible to be true such things could not hap- pen at high noon two street-cars crossing four- teenth on broadway--two cars with the-same joggle and bump and the same aspect of any of a hundred thousand at a traffic corner the -wonder is--there were so few people a telegraph car outgoing and a broadway car coming in the traffic police- man at his post had just given his signal two automobiles were passing and a single pedestrian so it is said was working his way diagonally across the corner of this we are not certain it was a moment that impinged on miracle even as we recount it knowing as we do the explana- tion we sense the impossibility of the event a phenomenon that holds out and in spite of our find- ings lingers into the miraculous to be and not to be one moment life and action an ordinary scene of existent monotony and the next moment noth- ing the spot the intersection of the street the passing street-cars the two automobiles pedestrian the policeman--non-existent when events are in- stantaneous reports are apt to be misleading this is what we find some of those who beheld it report a flash of bluish white light others that it was of a greenish or even a violet hue and others no doubt of strong- er vision that it was not only of a predominant color but that it was shot and sparkled with a myriad specks of flame and burning it gave no warning and it made no sound not even a whir like a hot breath out of the void whatever the forces that had focused they were destruction there was no fourteenth and broad- way the two automobiles the two street-cars the pedestrian the policeman had been whiffed away as if they had never existed in place of the inter- section of the thoroughfares was a yawning gulf that looked down into the center of the earth to a depth of nausea it was instantaneous it was without sound no warning a tremendous force of unlimited poten- tiality had been loosed to kinetic violence it was the suddenness and the silence that belied credence we were accustomed to associate all disaster with confusion calamity has an affinity with pandemo- nium all things of terror climax into sound in this case there was no sound hence the wonder a hole or bore forty feet in diameter without a particle of warning and without a bit of confu- sion the spectators one and all aver that at first they took it for nothing more than the effect of startled eyesight almost subtle it was not until after a full minute's reflection that they became aware that a miracle had been wrought before their faces then the crowd rushed up and with awe and now awakened terror gazed down into that ter- rible pit we say terrible because in this case it is an exact adjective the strangest hole that man ever looked into it was so deep that at first it appeared to have no bottom not even the strongest eyesight could penetrate the smoldering blackness that shrouded the depths descending it took a stout heart and courage to stand and hold one's head on the brink for even a minute it was straight and precipitous a perfect circle in shape with sides as smooth as the effect of ma- chine work the pavement and stone curb had been cut as if by a razor of the two street cars two automobiles and their occupants there was nothing the whole thing so silent and complete not even the spectators could really believe it it was a hard thing to believe the newspapers themselves when the news came clamoring accept- ed it with reluctance it was too much like a hoax not until the most trusted reporters had gone and had wired in their reports would they even con- sider it then the whole world sat up and took notice a miracle like oakland's press we all of us doubted that hole we had attained almost every- thing that was worth the knowing we were the masters of the earth and its secrets and we were proud of our wisdom naturally we refused such reports all out of reason it must be a hoax but the wires were persistent came corrobora- tion a reliable news-gathering organization soon was coming through with elaborate and detailed accounts of just what was happening we had the news from the highest and most reputable author- ity and still we doubted it was the story itself that brought the doubting its touch on miracle it was too easy to pick on the reporter there might be a hole and all that but this thing of no explana- tion a bomb perhaps no noise some new explosive no such thing well how did we know it was better than a miracle then came the scientists as soon as could be men of great minds had been hustled to the scene the world had long been accustomed to accept with- out quibble the dictum of these great specialists of fact with their train of accomplishments be- hind them we would hardly be consistent were we to doubt them we know the scientist and his habits he is the one man who will believe nothing until it is proved it is his profession and for that we pay him he can catch the smallest bug that ever crawled out of an atom and give it a name so long that a polish wrestler if he had to bear it would break under the burden it is his very knack of getting in under that has given us our civilization you don't baffle a scientist in our utopia it can't be done which is one of the very reasons why we began to believe in the miracle in a few moments a crowd of many thousands had gathered about the spot the throng grew so dense that there was peril of some of them being crowded into the pit at the center it took all the spare policemen of the city to beat them back far enough to string ropes from the corners for blocks the streets were packed with wondering thousands street traffic was impossible it was necessary to divert the cars to a roundabout route to keep the arteries open to the suburbs wild rumors spread over the city no one knew  amazing stories how many passengers had been upon the street cars the officials of the company from the schedule could pick the numbers of the cars and their crews but who could tell of the occupants telephones rang with tearful pleadings when the first rumors of the horror leaked out every wife and mother felt the clutch of panic at her heart- strings it was a moment of historical psychology out of our books we had read of this strange phase of human nature that was wont to rise like a mad screeching thing out of disaster we had never had it in utopia it was rumbling at first and out of exaggeration as the tale passed farther back to the waiting thousands it gained with the repetition grim and terrible enough in fact it ratioed up with reitera- tion perhaps after all it was not psychology the average impulse of the human mind does not even up so exactly in the light of what we now know it may have been the poison that had leaked into the air the new element that was permeating the atmosphere of the city at first it was spasmodic the nearest witnesses of the disaster were the first victims a strange malady began to spot out among hose of the crowd who had been at the spot of contact this is to be noticed a strange affliction which from the viru- lence and rapidity of action was quite puzzling to the doctors those among the physicians who would consent to statement gave it out that it was breaking down of tissue which of course it was the new ele- ment that was radiating through the atmosphere of the city they did not know it then the pity of it the subtle odorless pall was silently shrouding out over the city in a short time the hospitals were full and it was necessary to call in medical aid from san francisco they had not even time for diagnosis the new plague was fatal almost at conception happily the scien- tists made the discovery it was the pall at the end of three hours it was known that the death sheet was spreading out over oakland we may thank our stars that it was learned so early had the real warning come a few hours later the death list would have been appalling a new element had been discovered or if not a new element at least something which was tipping over all the laws of the atmospheric envelope a new combination that was fatal when the news and the warning went out panic fell upon the bay shore but some men stuck in the face of such terror there were those who stayed and with grimness and sacrifice hung to their posts for mankind there are some who had said that the stuff of heroes had passed away let them then consider the case of john robinson robinson was a telegraph operator until that day he was a poor unknown not a whit better than his fellows now he has a name that will run in history in the face of what he knew he remained under the blanket the last words out of oakland --his last message whole city of oakland in grip of strange mad- ness keep out of oakland--following which came a haphazard personal commentary i can feel it coming on myself it is like what our ancestors must have felt when they were getting drunk -- alternating desires of fight and singing--a strange sensation light and ecstatic with a spasmodic twitching over the forehead terribly thirsty will stick it out if i can get enough water never so dry in my life followed a lapse of silence then the last words i guess we're done for there is some poison in the atmosphere--something it has leaked of course out of this thing at fourteenth and broad- way dr manson of the american institute says it is something new that is forming a fatal com- bination but he cannot understand a new element the quantity is too enormous populace has been warned out of the city all roads are packed with refugees the berkeley hills are covered as with flies--north east and south and on the boats to frisco the poison what- ever it is is advancing in a ring from fourteenth and broadway you have got to pass it to these old boys of science they are staying with that ring already they have calculated the rate of its advance and have given warning they don't know what it is but they have figured just how fast it is moving they have saved the city i am one of the few men now inside the wave out of curiosity i have stuck i have a jug and as long as it lasts i shall stay strange feeling dry dry dry as if the juice of one's life cells was turning into dust water evaporating almost in- stantly it cannot pass through glass whatever the poison it has an affinity for moisture do not understand it i have had enough-- that was all after that there was no more news out of oakland it is the only word that we have out of the pall itself it was short and dis- connected and a bit slangy but for all that a basis from which to conjecture it is a strange and glorious thing how some men will stick to the post of danger this operator knew that it meant death but he held with duty had he been a man of scientific training his in- formation might have been of incalculable value however may god bless his heroic soul what we know is thirst the word that came from the experts confirmed it some new element of force was stealing or sapping the humidity out of the atmosphere whether this was combining and entering into a poison could not be determined chemists worked frantically at the outposts of the advancing ring in four hours it had covered the city in six it had reached san leandro and was advancing on toward haywards it was a strange story and incredible from the beginning no wonder the world doubted such a thing had never happened we had accepted the the law of judging the future by the past by deduc- tion we were used to sequence and to law to the laws of nature this thing did look like a miracle which was merely because--as usually it is with miracles--we could not understand it happily we can look back now and still place our faith in nature the world doubted and was afraid was this peril to spread slowly over the whole state of cali- fornia and then on to the--world doubt always precedes terror a tense world waited then came the word of reassurance--from the scientists the man who saved the earth  danger past vigor of the ring is abating cal- culation has deduced that the wave is slowly de- creasing in potentiality it is too early yet to say that there will be recessions as the wave is just reaching its zenith what it is we cannot say but it cannot be inexplicable after a little time it will all be explained say to the world there is no cause for alarm but the world was now aroused as it doubted the truth before it doubted now the reassurance did the scientists know could they have only seen the future we know now that they did not there was but one man in all the world great enough to foresee disaster that man was charley huyck chapter iii the mountain that was on the same day on which all this happened a young man pizzozi by name and of italian paren- tage left the little town of lone in amador county california with a small truck-load of salt he was one of the cattlemen whose headquarters or home-farms are clustered about the foot-hills of the sierras in the wet season they stay with their home-land in the valley in the summer they pene- trate into the mountains pizzozi had driven in from the mountains the night before after salt he had been on the road since midnight two thousand salt-hungry cattle do not allow time for gossip with the thrift of his race joe had loaded up his truck and after a running snatch at breakfast was headed back into the mountains when the news out of oakland was thrilling around the world he was far into the sierras the summer quarters of pizzozi were close to mt heckla whose looming shoulders rose square in the center of the pasture of the three brothers it was not a noted mountain--that is until this day--and had no reason for a name other than that it was a peak outstanding from the range like a thousand others rugged pine clad coated with deer-brush red soil and mountain miserie it was the- deer-brush that gave it value to the pizzozis--a succulent feed richer than alfalfa in the early summer they would come up with bony cattle when they returned in the fall they went out driving beef-steaks but inland cattle must have more than forage salt is the tincture that makes them healthy it was far past the time of the regular salting pizzozi was in a hurry it was nine o'clock when he passed through the raining town of jackson and by twelve o'clock--the minute of the disaster--he was well beyond the last little hamlet that linked up with civilization it was four o'clock when he drew up at the little pine-sheltered cabin that was his headquarters for the summer he had been on the road since midnight he was tired the long weary hours of driving the grades the unvaried stress though the deep red dust the heat the stretch of a night and day had worn both mind and muscle it had been his turn to go after salt now that he was here he could lie in for a bit of rest while his brothers did the salting it was a peaceful spot this cabin of the piz- zozis nestled among the virgin shade trees great tall feathery sugar-pines with a mountain live-oak spreading over the door yard to the east the rising heights of the sierras misty gray-green undulating into the distance to the pink-white snow crests of little alpine below in the canyon the waters of the mokolumne to the west the heavy dark masses of mt heckla deep verdant in the cool of coming evening joe drew up under the shade of the live oak the air was full of cool sweet scent of the afternoon no moment could have been more peaceful the blue clear sky overhead the breath of summer and the soothing spice of the pine trees a shepherd dog came bounding from the doorway to meet him it was his favorite cow dog usually when joe came back the dog would be far down the road to forestall him he had wondered absently coming up at the dog's delay a dog is most of all a creature of habit only something unusual would detain him however the dog was here as the man drew up he rushed out to greet him a rush a circle a bark and a whine of welcome perhaps the dog had been asleep but joe noticed that whine he was wise in the ways of dogs when ponto whined like that there was something unusual it was not effusive or spontaneous but rather of the delight of succor after scarce a minute of petting the dog squatted and faced to the westward his whine was start- ling almost fearful pizzozi knew that something was wrong the dog drew up his stub tail erect and his hair all bristled one look was for his master and the other whining and alert to mt heckla puzzled joe gazed at the mountain but he saw nothing was it the canine instinct or was it coincidence we have the aceount from pizzozi from the words of the italian the dog was afraid it was not the way of ponto usually in the face of danger he was alert and eager now he drew away to the cabin joe wondered inside the shack he found nothing but evidence of departure there was no sign of his brothers at was his turn to go to sleep he was wearied almost to numbness for forty-eight hours he had not closed an eyelid on the table were a few unwashed dishes and crumbs of eating one of the three rifles that hung usually on the wall was missing the cof fee pot was on the floor with the lid open on the bed the coverlets wre mussed up it was a temp- tation to go to sleep back of him the open door and ponto the whine of the dog drew his will and his consciousness into correlation a faint rustle in the sugar-pines soughed from the canyon joe watched the dog the sun was just glowing over the crest of the mountain on the western line the deep lacy silhouettes of the pine trees and the bare bald head of heckla what was it his brothers should be on hand for the salting it was not their custom to put things off for the morrow shading his eyes he stepped out of the doorway the dog rose stealthily and walked behind him uneasily with the same insistent whine and ruffled hair joe listened only the mountain murmurs the sweet breath of the forest and in the lapse of bated breath the rippling melody of the river far below him what you see ponto what you see at the words the dog sniffed and advanced slight-  amazing stories ly--a growl and then a sudden scurry to the heels of his master ponto was afraid it puzzled pizzozi but whatever it was that roused his fear it was on mt heckla this is one of the strange parts of the story-- the part the dog played and what came after although it is a trivial thing it is one of the most inexplicable did the dog sense it we have no measure for the range of instinct but we do have it that before the destruction of pompeii the beasts roared in their cages still knowing what we now know it is hard to accept the analogy it may after all have been coincidence nevertheless it decided pizzozi the cattle needed salt he would catch up his pinto and ride over to the salt logs there is no moment in the cattle industry quite like the salting on the range it is not the most spectacular perhaps but surely it is not lacking in intenseness the way of pizzozi was musical even if not operatic he had a long-range call a rising rhythm that for depth and tone had a peculiar effect on the shattered stillness it echoed and reverberated and peeled from the top to the bot- tom of the mountain the salt call is the talisman of the mountains alleewahoo two thousand cattle augmented by a thousand strays held up their heads in answer the sniff of the welcome salt call through the whole range of the man's voice the stock stopped in their leafy pasture and listened alleewahoo an old cow bellowed it was the beginning of bedlam from the bottom of the mountain to the top and for miles beyond went forth the salt call three thousand head bellowed to the delight of salt- ing pizzozi rode along each lope of his pinto through the tall tangled miserie was accented alleeivahoo alleewahoo the rending of brush the confusion and pandemonium spread to the very bottom of the leafy gulches it is no place for a pedestrian heads and tails erect the cattle were stampeding toward the logs a few head had beat him to it these he quickly drove away and cut the sack open with haste he poured it upon the logs then he rode out of the dust that for yards about the place was tramped to the finest powder the center of a herd of salting range stock is no place for comfort the man rode away to the left he ascended a low knob where he would be safe from the stampede but close enough to distinguish the brands in no time the place was alive with milling stock old cows heifers bulls calves steers rushed out of the crashing brush into the clearing there is no moment exactly like it what before had been a broad clearing of brownish reddish dust was trampled into a vast cloud of bellowing blur a thou- sand cattle and still coming from the farthest height came the echoing call pizzozi glanced up at the top of the mountain and then a strange thing happened from what we gathered from the excited ac- counts of pizzozi it was instantaneous and yet by the same words it was of such a peculiar and beau- tiful effect as never to be forgotten a bluish azure shot though with a myriad flecks of crimson a peculiar vividness of opalescence the whole world scintillating the sky the air the mountain a vast flame of color so wide and so intense that there seemed not a thing beside it and instantaneous-- it was over almost before it was started no noise or warning and no subsequent detonation as silent as winking and much indeed like the queer blur of color induced by defective vision all in the fraction of a second pizzozi had been gazing at the mountain there was no mountain neither were there cattle where before had been the shade of the towering peak was now the rays of the western sun where had been the blur of the milling herd and its deafening pandemonium was now a strange silence the transparency of the air was unbroken into the distance far off lay a peaceful range in the sunset there was no mountain neither were there cattle for a moment the man had enough to do with his plunging mustang in the blur of the subse- quent second pizzozi remembers nothing but a convulsion of fighting horseflesh bucking twisting plunging the gentle pinto suddenly maddened into a demon it required all'the skill of the cowman to retain his saddle he did not know that he was riding on the rim of eternity in his mind was the dim subconscious realization of a thing that had happened in spite of all his efforts the horse fought backward it was some moments before he conquered then he looked it was a slow hesitant moment one cannot ac- count for what he will do in the open face of a miracle what the italian beheld was enough for terror the sheer immensity of the thing was too much for thinking at the first sight his simplex mind went numb from sheer impotence his terror to a degree frozen the whole of mt heckla had been shorn away in the place of its darkened shadow the sinking sun was blinking in his face the whole western sky all golden there was no vestige of the flat salt-clear- ing at the base of the mountain of the two thou- sand cattle milling in the dust not a one remained the man crossed himself in stupor mechanically he put the spurs to the pinto but the mustang would not another struggle with bucking fighting maddened horseflesh the cow-man must needs bring in all the skill of his training but by the time he had conquered his mind had settled within some scope of comprehen- sion the pony had good reasons for his terror this time'though the man's mind reeled it did not go dumb at the clash of immensity not only had the whole mountain been torn away but its roots as well the whole thing was up-side down the world torn to its entrails in place of what had been the height was a gulf so deep that its depths were blackness he was standing on the brink he was a cool man was pizzozi but it was hard in the con- fusion of such a miracle to think clearly much less to reason the prancing mustang was snorting with terror the man glanced down the very dizziness of the gulf sheer losing itself into shadows and chaos overpowered him his mind the man who saved the earth  now clear enough for perception reeled at the dis- tance the depth was nauseating his whole body succumbed to a sudden qualm of weakness the sickness that comes just before falling he went limp in the saddle but the horse fought backward warned by in- stinct it drew back from the sheer banks of the gulf it had no reason but its nature at the in- stant it sensed the snapping of the iron will of its master in a moment it had turned and was racing on its wild way out of the mountains at supreme moments a cattle horse will always hit for home the pinto and its limp rider were fleeing on the road to jackson pizzozi had no knowledge of what had occurred in oakland to him the whole thing had been but a flash of miracle he could not reason he did not curb his horse that he was still in the saddle was due more to the near-instinct of his training than to his volition he did not even draw up at the cabin that he could make better time with his motor than with his pinto did not occur to him his mind was far too busy and now that the thing was passed too full of terror it was forty-four miles to town it was night and the stars were shining when he rode into jackson chapter iv man--a great little bug and what of charley huyck it was his antici- pation and his training which leaves us here to tell the story were it not for the strange manner of his rearing and the keen faith and appreciation of dr robold there would be to-day no tale to tell the little incident of the burning-glass had grown if there is no such thing as fate there is at least something that comes very close to being destiny on this night we find charley at the observatory in arizona he is a grown man and a great one and though mature not so very far drawn from the lad we met on the street selling papers tall slender very slightly stooped and with the same idealistic dreaming eyes of the poet surely no one at first glance would have taken him for a scien- tist which he was and was not indeed there is something vastly different about the science of charley huyck science to be sure but not prosaic he was the first and perhaps the last of the school of dr robold a peculiar combination of poetry and fact a man of vision of vast far-seeing faith and idealism linked and based on the coldest and sternest truths of materialism a peculiar tenet of the theory of robold true science to be itself should be half poetry which any of us who have read or been at school know it is not it is a peculiar theory and though rather wild still with some points in favor we all of us know our schoolmasters especially those of science and what they stand for facts facts nothing but facts no dreams or romance looking back we can grant them just about the emotions of cucumbers we remember their cold hard features the prodding after fact the accumu- lation of data surely there is no poetry in them yet we must not deny that they have been by far the most potent of all men in the progress of civilzation not even robold would deny it the point is this the doctor maintained that from the beginning the progress of material civilization had been along three distinct channels science invention and ad- ministration it was simply his theory that the first two should be one that the scientist deal not alone with dry fact but with invention and that the inventor unless he is a scientist has mastered but half his trade the really great scientist should be a visionary said robold and an in- ventor is merely a poet with tools which is where we get charley huyck he was a visionary a scientist a poet with tools the protge of dr robold he dreamed things that no scientist had thought of and we are thankful for his dreaming the one great friend of huyck was professor williams a man from charley's home city who had known him even back in the days of selling papers they had been cronies in boyhood in their teens and again at college in after years when huyck had become the visionary the mysterious man of the mountain and williams a great professor of astronomy the friendship was as strong as ever but there was a difference between them wil- liams was exact to acuteness with not a whit of vision beyond pure science he had been reared in the old stone-cold theory of exactness he lived in figures he could not understand huyck or his reasoning perfectly willing to follow as far as facts permitted he refused to step off into specu- lation which was the point between them charley huyck had vision although exact as any man he had ever one part of his mind soaring out into speculation what is and what might be and the gulf between to bridge the gulf was the life work of charley huyck in the snug little office in arizona we find them charley with his feet poised on the desk and wil- liams precise and punctilious true to his training defending the exactness of his philosophy it was the cool of the evening the sun was just mellowing the heat of the desert through the open door and windows a cool wind was blowing charley was smoking the same old pipe had been the bane of williams's life at college then we know he was asking yes spoke the professor what we know charley we know though of course it is not much it is very hard nay impossible to deny figures we have not only the proofs of geology but of astro- nomical calculation we have facts and figuies plus our sidereal relations all about us the world must come to an end it is a hard thing to say it but it is a fact of science slowly inevitably ruthlessly the end will come a mere question of arithmetic huyck nodded it was his special function in life to differ with his former roommate he had come down from his own mountain in colorado just for the delight of difference i see your old calculations of tidal retarda- tion or if that doesn't work the loss of oxygen and the water either one or the other a matter of figures the earth is being drawn every day by the sun its ro- tation is slowing up when the time comes it will  amazing stories act to the sun in exactly the same manner as the moon acts to the earth to-day i understand it will be a case of eternal night for one side of the earth and eternal day for the other a case of burn up or freeze up exactly of if it doesn't reach to that the water gas will gradually lose out into sidereal space and we will go to desert merely a ques- tion of the old dynamical theory of gases of the molecules to be in motion to be forever colliding and shooting out into variance each minute each hour each day we are losing part of our atmospheric envelope in course of time it will all be gone when it is we shall be all desert for intance take a look outside this is arizona once it was the bottom of a deep blue sea why deny when we can already behold the beginning the other laughed pretty good mathematics at that professor only-- only that it is merely mathematics merely mathematics the professor frowned slightly mathematics do not lie charlie you cannot get away from them what sort of fanciful argument are you bringing up now simply this returned the other that you de- pend too much on figures they are material and in the nature of things can only be employed in a calculation of what may happen in the future you must have premises to stand on facts your fig- ures are rigid they have no elasticity unless your foundations are permanent and faultless your de- ductions will lead you only into error granted just the point we know where we stand wherein are we in error it was the old point of difference huyck was ever crashing down the idols of pure materialism williams was of the world-wide school you are in error my dear professor in a very little thing and a very large one what is that man man yes he's a great little bug you have left him out of your calculation--which he will upset the professor smiled indulgently i'll allow he is at least a conceited bug but you surely cannot grant him much when pitted against the universe no did it ever occur to you professor what the universe is the stars for instance space the immeasurable distance of infinity have you never dreamed williams could not quite grasp him huyck had a habit that had grown out of childhood always he would allow his opponent to commit himself the professor did not answer but the other spoke ether you know it whether mind or granite for instance your desert he placed his finger to his forehead your mind my mind--localized ether what are you driving at merely this your universe has intelligence it has mind as well as matter the little knot called the earth is becoming conscious your deductions are incompetent unless they embrace mind as well as matter and they cannot do it your mathe- matics are worthless the professor bit his lip always fanciful he commented and vision- ary your argument is beautiful charley and hopeful i would that it were true but all things must mature even an earth must die not our earth you look into the past profes- sor for your proof and i look into the future give a planet long enough time in maturing and it will develop life give it still longer and it will pro- duce intelligence our own earth is just coming into consciousness it has thirty million years at least to run you mean this that man is a great little bug mind the intelligence of the earth this of course is a bit dry the conversation of such men very often is to those who do not care to follow them but it is very pertinent to what came after we know now everyone knows that charley huyck was right even professor wil- liams admits it our earth is conscious in less than twenty-four hours it had to employ its con- sciousness to save itself from destruction a bell rang it was the private wire that con- nected the office with the residence the professor picked up the receiver just a minute yes all right then to his companion i must go over to the house charley we have plenty of time then we can go up to the observatory which shows how little we know about ourselves poor professor williams little did he think that those casual words were the last he would ever speak to charley huyck the whole world seething the beginning of the end charley huyck in the vortex the next few hours were to be the most strenuous of the planet's history chapter v approaching disaster it was night the stars which had just been coming out were spotted by millions over the sleep- ing desert one of the nights that are peculiar to the country which we all of us know so well if not from experience at least from hearsay mellow soft sprinkled like salted fire twinkling each little light a message out of infinity cos- mic grandeur mind chaos eternity--a night for dreaming whoever had chosen the spot in the desert had picked full well charley had spoken of consciousness on that night when he gazed up at the stars he was its personification surely a good spirit was watching over the earth a cool wind was blowing on its breath floated the murmurs from the village laughter the song of children the purring of motors and the startled barking of a dog the confused drone of man and his civilization from the eminence the observa- tory looked down upon the town and the sheen of light spotting like jewels in the dim glow of the desert to the east the mellow moon just tipping over the mountain charley stepped to the window he could see it all the subtle beauty that was so akin to poetry the stretch of desert the moun- tains the light in the eastern sky the dull level the man who saved the earth  shadow that marked the plain to the northward to the west the mountains looming black to the star line a beautiful night sweetened with the breath of desert and tuned to its slumber across the lawn he watched the professor descending the pathway under the acacias an automobile was coming up the driveway as it drove up under the arcs he noticed its powerful lines and its driver one of those splendid pleasure cars that have returned to favor during the last decade the soft purr of its motor the great heavy tires and its coating of dust there is a lure about a great car coming in from the desert the car stopped charley noted doubtless some one for williams if it were he would go into the observatory alone in the strict sense of the word huyck was not an astronomer he had not made it his profes- sion but for all that he knew things about the stars that the more exact professors had not dreamed of charley was a dreamer he had a code all his own and a manner of reasoning be- tween him and the stars lay a secret he had not divulged it or if he had it was in such an open way that it was laughed at it was not cold enough in calculation or even if so was too far from their deduction huyck had imagina- tion his universe was alive and potent it had in- telligence matter could not live without it man was its manifestation just come to consciousness the universe teemed with intelligence charley looked at the stars he crossed the office passed through the recep- tion-room and thence to the stairs that led to the observatory in the time that would lapse before the coming of his friend he would have ample time for observation somehow he felt that there was time for discovery he had come down to arizona to employ the lens of his friend the astronomer the instrument that he had erected on his own mountain in colorado had not given him the full satisfaction that he expected here in arizona in the dry clear air which had hitherto given such splendid results he hoped to find what he was after but little did he expect to discover the terrible thing he did it is one of the strangest parts of the story that he should be here at the very moment when fate and the world's safety would have had him for years he and dr robold had been at work on their visionary projects they were both dream- ers while others had scoffed they had silently been at their great work on kinetics the boy and the burning glass had grown under the tutelage of dr robold the time was about at hand when he could out-rival the saying of arch- imedes though the world knew it not charley huyck had arrived at the point where he could literally burn up the earth but he was not sinister though he had the power he had of course not the slightest intention he was a dreamer and it was part of his dream that man break his thraldom to the earth and reach out into the universe it was a great conception and were it not for the terrible event which took his life we have no doubt but that he would have succeeded it was ten-thirty when he mounted the steps and seated himself he glanced at his watch he had a good ten minutes he had computed before just the time for the observation for months he had waited for just this moment he had not hoped to be alone and now that he was in solitary possession he counted himself fortunate only the stars and charley huyck knew the secret and not even he dreamed what it would amount to from his pocket he drew a number of papers most of them covered with notations some with drawings and a good sized map in colors this he spread before him and with his pencil began to draw right across its face a net of lines and cross lines a number of figures and a rapid com- putation he nodded and then he made the obser- vation it would have been interesting to study the face of charley huyck during the next few moments at first he was merely receptive his face placid but with the studious intentness of one who has come to the moment and as he began to find what he was after-an eagerness of satisfaction then a queer blankness the slight movement of his body stopped and the tapping of his feet ceased entirely jpor a full five minutes an absolute intentness during that time he was out among the stars be- holding what not even he had dreamed of it was more than a secret and what it was only charley huyck of all the millions of men could have recog- nized yet it was more than even he had expected when he at last drew away his face was chalk-like great drops of sweat stood on his forehead and the terrible truth in his eyes made him look ten years older my god for a moment indecision and strange impotence the truth he had beheld numbed action from his lips the mumbled words this world my world our great and splendid mankind a sentence that was despair and a benediction then mechanically he turned back to confirm his observation this time knowing what he would see he was not so horrified his mind was cleared by the plain fact of what he was beholding when at last he drew away his face was settled he was a man who thought quickly--thank the stars for that--and once he thought quick to spring to action there was a peril poising over the earth if it were to be voided there was not a second to lose in weighing up the possibilities he had been dreaming all his life he had never thought that the climax was to be the very opposite of what he hoped for in his under mind he prayed for dr robold--dead and gone forever were he only here to help him he seized a piece of paper over its white face he ran a mass of computations he worked like lightning his fingers plying and his mind keyed to the pin-point of genius not one thing did he overlook in his calculation if the earth had a chance he would find it there are always possibilities he was working out the odds of the greatest race since creation while the whole world slept while the uncounted millions lay down in fond security charley huyck there in the lonely room on the desert drew out their figured odds to the point of infinity just one chance in a million  amazing stories he was going to take it the words were not out of his mouth before his long legs were leaping down the stairway in the flash of seconds his mind was rushing into clear action he had had years of dreaming all his years of study and tutelage under robold gave him just the training for such a disaster but he needed time time time why was it so precious he must get to his own mountain in six jumps he was in the office it was empty the professor had not returned he thought rather grimly and fleetingly of their conversation a few minutes before what would williams think now of science and consciousness he picked up the telephone receiver while he waited he saw out of the corner of his eye the car in the driveway it was-- hello the professor what gone down to town no well say this is charley--he was watching the car in front of the building say hello--tell him i have gone home home h-o-m-e to colorado-- to colorado yes--to the mountain --the m-o-u-n-t-a-i-n oh never mind--i'll leave a note he clamped down the receiver on the desk he scrawled on a piece of paper ed tjook these up i'm bound for the mountain no time to explain there's a car outside stay with the lens don't leave it if the earth goes up you wil know that i have not reached the mountain beside the note he placed one of the maps that he had in his pocket-with his pencil drew a black cross just above the center under the map were a number of computations it is interesting to note that in the stress of the fereat critical moment he forgot the professor's title it was a good thing when williams read it he recognized the significance all through their life in crucial moments he had been ed to charley but the note was all he was destined to find a brisk wind was blowing by a strange balance of fate the same movement that let huyck out of the building ushered in the wind and upset calculation it was a little thing but it was enough to keep all the world in ignorance and despair the eddy whisking in through the door picked up the pre- cious map poised it like a tiny plane and dropped it neatly behind a bookcase chapter vi a race to save the world huyck was working in a straight line almost before his last words on the phone were spoken he had requisitioned that automobile outside whether money or talk faith or force he was going to have it the hum of the motor sounded in his ears as he ran down the steps he was hatless and in his shirt-sleeves the driver was just putting some tools in the car with one jump charley had him by the collar five thousand dollars if you can get me to ro- bold mountain in twenty hours the very suddenness of the rush caught the man by surprise and lurched him against the car turn- ing him half around charley found himself gazing into dull brown eyes and sardonic laughter a long thin nose and lips drooped at the corners then as suddenly tipping up--a queer creature half devil half laughter and all fun easy charley easy how much did you say whisper it it was bob winters bob winters and his car and waiting surely no twist of fortune could nave been greater he was a college chum of huyck's and of the professor's if there was one man that could make the run in the time allotted bob was he but huyck was impersonal with the burden on his mind he thought of naught but his destina- tion ten thousand he shouted the man held back his head huyck was far too serious to appreciate mischief but not the man charley huyck of all men did young lochinvar come out of the west how much did you say this desert air and the dust tis hard on the hear- ing she must be a young fair maiden ten thou- sand twenty thousand thirty thousand damna- tion man you can have the mountain into the car by sheer subjective strength he forced the other into the machine it was not until they were shoot- ing out of the grounds on two wheels that he real- ized that the man was bob winters still the workings of fate the madcap and wild bob of the races surely destiny was on the job the challenge of speed and the premium at the opportune moment be- fore disaster the two men were brought together minutes weighed up with centuries and hours out- balanced millenniums the whole world slept little did it dream that its very life was riding north with these two men into the midnight into the midnight the great car the pride of winter's heart leaped between the pillars at the very outset madcap that he was he sent her into seventy miles an hour they fairly jumped off the hill into the village at a full seventy-five he took the curve she skidded sheered half around and swept on for an instant charley held his breath but the master hand held her she steadied straightened and shot out into the desert above the whir of the motor flying dust and blurring what-not char- ley got the tones of his companion's voice he had heard the words somewhere in history keep your seat mr greely keep your seat the moon was now far up over the mountain the whole desert was bathed in a mellow twilight in the distance the mountains brooded like an uncertain slumbering cloud bank they were headed straight to the northward though there was a better road round about winters had chosen the hard rocky bee-line to the mountain -ie knew huyck and his reputation when charley offered thirty thousand for a twenty-hour drive it was not mere byplay he had happened in at the observatory to drop in on williams on his way to the coast they had been classmates likewise he and charley when the excited man out of the observatory had seized him by the collar winters merely had laughed he was the speed king the three boys who had the man who saved the earth  gone to school were now playing with the destiny of the earth but only huyck knew it winters wondered through miles and miles of fleeting sagebrush cacti and sand and desolation he rolled over the problem steady as a rock slight- ly stooped grim and as certain as steel he held to the north charley huyck by his side hatless coat- less his hair dancing to the wind all impatience why was it surely a man even for death would have time to get his hat the whole thing spelled speed to bob winters perhaps it was the infusion of spirit or the inten- sity of his companion but the thrill ran into his vitals thirty thousand dollars--for a stake like that--what was the balance he had been called wild bob for his daring some had called him in- sane on this night his insanity was enchantment it was wild the lee of the giant roadster a whir- ring shower of gravel into the darkness into the night the car fought over the distance the terrific momentum and the friction of the air fought in their faces huyck's face was unprotected in no time his lips were cracked and long before they had crossed the level his whole face was bleeding but he heeded it not he only knew that they were moving that slowly minute by minute they were cutting down the odds that bore disaster in his mind a maze of figures the terrible sight he had seen in the telescope and the thing impending why had he kept his secret over and again he impeached himself and dr robold it had come to this the whole world sleeping and only himself to save it oh for a few minutes for one short moment would he get it at last they reached the mountains a rough rocky road and but little traveled happily winters had made it once before and knew it he took it with every bit of speed they could stand but even at that it was diminished to a minimum for hours they fought over grades and gulches dry washouts and boulders it was dawn and the sky was growing pink when they rode down again upon the level it was here that they ran across their first trouble and it was here that winters began to realize vaguely what a race they might be running the particular level which they had entered was an elbow of the desert projecting into the mountains just below a massive newly constructed dam the reservoir had but lately been filled and all was being put in readiness for the dedication an immense sheet of water extending far back into the mountains--it was intended before long to transform the desert into a garden below in the valley was a town already the center of a prosper- ous irrigation settlement but soon with the added area to become a flourishing city the elbow where they struck it was perhaps twenty miles across their northward path would take them just outside the tip where the foothills of the opposite mountain chain melted into the desert without ado winters put on all speed and plunged across the sands and then it was much like winking but for all that some- thing far more impressive to winters on the left hand of the car and with the east on the right hand it was much as if the sun had suddenly leaped up and as suddenly plumped down behind the horizon-- a vast vividness of scintillating opalescence an azure flaming diamond shot by a million fire points instantaneous and beautiful in the pale dawn of the desert air its wonder and color were beyond all beauty winters caught it out of the corner of his eye it was so instantaneous and so illusive that he was not certain instinctively he looked to his companion but charley too had seen it his attitude of waiting and hoping was vigorized into vivid action he knew just what it was with one hand he clutched winters and fairly shouted on on bob on as you value your life put into her every bit of speed you have got at the same instant at the same breath came a roar that was not to be forgotten crunching roll- ing terrible--like the mountain moving bob knew it it was the dam something had broken it to the east the great wall of water fall- out of the mountains a beautiful sight and ter- rible a relentless glassy roller fringed along its base by a lace of racing foam the upper part was as smooth as crystal the stored-up waters of the mountain moving out compactly the man thought of the little town below and its peril but huyck thought also he shouted in winter's ear never mind the town keep straight north over yonder to the point of the water the town will have to drown it was inexorable there was no pity the very strength and purpose of the command drove into the other's understanding dimly now he realized that they were really running a race against time winters was a daredevil the very catastrophe sent a thrill of exultation through him it was the cli- max the great moment of his life to be driving at a hundred miles an hour under that wall of water the roar was terrible before they were half across it seemed to the two men that the very sound would drown them there was nothing in the world but pandemonium the strange flash was forgotten in the terror of the living wall that was reaching out to engulf them like insects they whizzed in the open face of the deluge when they had reached the tip they were so close that the out- running fringe of the surf was at their wheels around the point with the wide open plain be- fore them with the flood behind them it was noth- ing to outrun it the waters with a wider stretch spread out in a few moments they had left all be- hind them but winters wondered what was the strange flash of evanescent beauty he knew this dam and its construction to outlast the centuries it had been whiffed in a second it was not lightning he had heard no sound other than the rush of the waters he looked to his companion hucyk nodded that's the thing we are racing we have only a few hours can we make it bob had thought that he was getting all the speed possible out of his motor what it yielded from that moment on was a revelation it is not safe and hardly possible to be driving at such speed on the desert only the best car and a firm roadway can stand it a sudden rut squirrel hole or pocket of sand is as good as destruction they rushed on till noon  amazing stories not even winters with all his alertness could avoid it perhaps he was weary the tedious hours the racking speed had worn him to exhaustion they had ceased to individualize their way a blur a nightmare of speed and distance it came suddenly a blind barranca--one of those sunken useless channels that are death to the un- wary no warning it was over just that quickly a mere flash of consciousness plus a sensation of flying two men broken on the sands and the great beautiful roads- ter a twisted ruin chapter vii a riven continent but back to the world no one knew about charley huyck nor what was occurring on the desert even if we had it would have been impos- sible to construe connection after the news out of oakland and the destruc- tion of mt heckla we were far too appalled the whole thing was beyond us not even the scientists with all their data could find one thing to work on the wires of the world buzzed with wonder and with panic we were civilized it is really strange how quickly in spite of our boasted powers we revert to the primitive superstition cannot die where was no explana- tion must be miracle the thing had been repeated when would it strike again and where there was not long to wait but this time the stroke was of far more consequence and of far more terror the sheer might of the thing shook the earth not a man or government that would not resign in the face of such destruction it was omnipotent a whole continent had been riven it would be impossible to give description of such catastrophe no pen can tell it any more than it could describe the creation we can only follow in its path on the morning after the first catastrophe at eight o'clock just south of the little city of santa cruz on the north shore of the bay of monterey the same light and the same though not quite the same instantaneousness those who beheld it re- port a vast ball of azure blue and opalescent fire and motion a strange sensation of vitalized vibra- tion of personified living force in shape like a marble as round as a full moon in its glory but of infinitely more beauty it came from nowhere neither from above the earth nor below it seeming to leap out of nothing it glided or rather vanished to the eastward still the effect of winking though this time perhaps from a distanced focus more vivid a dot or marble like a full moon burning opal soaring to the eastward and instantaneous gone as soon as it was come noiseless and of phantom beauty like a finger of the omnipotent tracing across the world and as ter- rible the human mind had never conceived a thing so vast beginning at the sands of the ocean the whole country had vanished a chasm twelve miles wide and of unknown depth running straight to the east- ward where had been farms and homes was noth- ing the mountains had been seared like butter straight as an arrow then the roar of the deluge the waters of the pacific breaking through its sands and rolling into the gulf of mexico that there was no heatj was evidenced by the fact that there was no steam the thing could not be internal yet what was it one can only conceive in figures from the shores of santa cruz to the atlantic--a few sec- onds then out into the eastern ocean straight out into the sea of the sargasso a great gulf riven straight across the face of north america the path seemed to follow the sun it bore to the eastward with a slight southern deviation the mountains it cut like cheese passing just north of fresno it seared through the gigantic sierras halfway between the yosemite and mt whitney through the great desert to southern nevada thence across northern arizona new mexico texas ar- kansas mississippi alabama and georgia entering the atlantic at a point half-way between brunswick and jacksonville a great canal twelve miles in width linking the oceans a cataclysmic blessing today with thousands of ships bearing freight over its water we can bless that part of the dis- aster but there was more to come so far the miracle had been sporadic whatever had been its force it had been fatal only on point and occasion in a way it had been local the deadly atmospheric com- bination of its aftermath was invariable in its re- cession there was no suffering the death that it dealt was the death of obliteration but now it entered on another stage the world is one vast ball and though large still a very small place to live in there are few of us perhaps who look upon it or even stop to think of it as a living being yet it is just that it has its currents life pulse and its fevers it is coordinate a million things such as the great streams of the ocean the swirls of the atmosphere make it a place to live in and we are conscious only or mostly through disaster a strange thing happened the great opal like a mountain of fire had riven across the continent from the beginning and with each succession the thing was magnified but it was not until it had struck the waters of the at- lantic that we became aware of its full potency and its fatality the earth quivered at the shock and man stood on his toes in terror in twenty-four hours our civilization was literally falling to pieces we were powerful with the forces that we understood but against this that had been literally ripped from the unknown we were insignificant the whole world was frozen let us see into the atlantic the transition hitherto silence but now the roar of ten thousand million niagaras the waters of the ocean rolling catapult- ing roaring into the gulf that had been seared in its bosom the gulf stream cut in two the cur- rents that tempered our civilization sheared in a second straight into the sargasso sea the great opal liquid fire luminiscent a ball like the setting sun lay poised upon the ocean it was the end of the earth what was this thing the whole world knew of the man who saved the earth  it in a second and not a one could tell in less than forty hours after its first appearance in oak- land it had consumed a mountain riven a continent and was drjnking up an ocean the tangled sea of the sargasso dead calm for ages was a cataract a swirling torrent of maddened waters rushed to the opal--and disappeared it was hellish and out of madness as beautiful as it was uncanny the opal high as the himalayas brooding upon the water its myriad colors blending winking in a phantasm of iridescence the beauty of its light could be seen a thousand miles a thing out of mystery and out of forces we had discovered many things and knew much but had guessed no such thing as this it was vampirish and it was literally drinking up the earth consequences were immediate the point of con- tact was fifty miles across the waters of the at- lantic with one accord turned to the magnet the gulf stream veered straight from its course and out across the atlantic the icy currents from the poles freed from the warmer barrier descended along the coasts and thence out into the sargasso sea the temperature of the temperate zone dipped below the point of a blizzard the first word come out of london freezing and in july the fruit and entire harvest of north- ern europe destroyed olympic games at copen- hagen postponed by a foot of snow the river seine frozen snow falling in new york crops nipped with frost as far south as cape hatteras a fleet of airplanes was despatched from the united states and another from the west coast of africa not half of them returned those that did reported even more disaster the reports that were handed in were appalling they had sailed straight on it was like flying into the sun the vividness of the opalescence was blinding rising for miles above them alluring drawing and unholy and of a beauty that was terror only the tardy had escaped it even drew their motors it was like gravity suddenly become vital- ized and conscious thousands of machines vaulted into the opalescence from those ahead hopelessly drawn and powerless came back the warning but hundreds could not escape back came the wireless do not come too close the thing is a magnet turn back before too late against this man is insignificant then like gnats flitting into fixe they vanished into the opalescence the others turned back the whole world freez- ing shuddered in horror a great vampire was brooding over the earth the greatness that man had attained to was nothing civilization was tot- tering in a day we were hopeless then came the last revelation the truth and verity of the disaster and the threatened climax the water level of all the coast had gone down vast ebb tides had gone out not to return stretches of sand where had been surf extended far out into the sea then the truth the thing whatever it was was drinking up the ocean chapter viii the man who saved the earth it was tragic grim terrible cosmic out of no- where had come this thing that was eating up the earth not a thing out of all our science had there been to warn us not a word from all our wise men we who had built up our civilization piece by piece were after all but insects we were going out in a maze of beauty into the infinity whence we came hour by hour the great orb of opalescence grew in splendor the effect and the beauty of its lure spread about the earth thril- ling vibrant like suppressed music the old earth helpless was it possible that out of her bosom she could not pluck one intelligence to save her was there not one law--no answer out on the desert with his face to the sun lay the answer though almost hopeless there was still some time and enough of near-miracle to save us a limping fate in the shape of two indians and a battered runabout at the last moment little did the two red men know the value of the two men found that day on the desert to them the debris of the mighty car and the prone bodies told enough of the story they were samaritans but there are many ages to bless them as it was there were many hours lost without this loss there would have been thousands spared and an almost immeasurable amount of disaster but we have still to be thankful charley huyck was still living he had been stunned battered bruised and un- conscious but he had not been injured vitally there was still enough left of him to di-ag himself to the old runabout and call for winters his com- panion as it happened was in even better shape than himself and waiting we do not know how they talked the red men out of their relic--whether by coaxing by threat or by force straight north two men battered worn bruised but steadfast bearing in that limping old motor- car the destiny of the earth fate was still on the job but badly crippled they had lost many precious hours winters had forfeited his right to the thirty thousand he did not care he understood vaguely that there was a stake over and above all money huyck said nothing he was too maimed and too much below will-power to think of speaking what had occurred during the many hours of their unconsciousness was unknown to them it was not until they came sheer upon the gulf that had been riven straight across the continent that the awful truth dawned on them to winters it was terrible the mere glimpse of that blackened chasm was terror it was bottom- less so deep that its depths were cloudy the misty haze of its uncertain shadows was akin to chaos he understood vaguely that it was related to that terrible thing they had beheld in the morning it was not the power of man some force had been loosened which was ripping the earth to its vitals across the terror of the chasm he made out the dim outlines of the opposite wall a full twelve miles across for a moment the sight overcame even huyck himself full well he knew but knowing as he did the full fact of the miracle was even more than he expected his long years under robold his scien- tific imagination had given him comprehension not puny steam nor weird electricity but force kinetics--out of the universe  amazing stories he knew but knowing as he did he was over- come by the horror such a thing turned loose upon the earth he had lost many hours he had but a few hours remaining the thought gave him sud- den energy he seized winters by the arm to the first town bob to the first town--an aerodome there was speed in that motor for all its decades winters turned about and shot out in a lateral course parallel to the great chasm but for all his speed he could not keep back his question in the name of heaven charley what did it what is it came the answer and it drove the lust of all speed through winters bob said charley it is the end of the world-- if we don't make it but a few hours left we must have an airplane i must make the moun- tain it was enough for wild bob he settled down it was only an old runabout but he could get speed out of a wheelbarrow he had never driven a race like this just once did he speak the words were characteristic a world's record charley and we're going to win just watch us and they did there was no time lost in the change the mere fact of huyck's name his appearance and the man- ner of his arrival was enough for the last hours messages had been pouring in at every post in the rocky mountains for charley huyck after the failure of all others many thousands had thought of him even the government unappreciative before had awakened to a belated and almost frantic eagerness orders were out that everything no matter what was to be at his disposal he had been regarded as visionary but in the face of what had occurred visions were now the most practical things for mankind besides professor williams had sent out to the world the strange portent of huyck's note for years there had been mystery on that mountain could it be unfortunately we cannot give it the description we would like to give few men outside of the reg- ular employees have ever been to the mountain of robold from the very first owing perhaps to the great forces stored and the danger of carelessness strangers and visitors had been barred then too the secrecy of dr robold--and the respect of his successor but we do know that the burning glass had grown into the mountain bob winters and the aviator are the only ones -to tell us the employees one and all chose to re- main the cataclysm that followed destroyed the work of huyck and robold--but not until it had served the greatest deed that ever came out of the minds of men and had it not been for huyck's in- sistence we would not have even the account that we are giving it was he who insisted nay begged that his com- panions return while there was yet a chance full well he knew out of the universe out of space he had coaxed the forces that would burn up the earth the great ball of luminous opalescence and the diminishing ocean there was but one answer through the imagi- native genius of robold and huyck fate had work- ed up to the moment the lad and the burning glass had grown to archimedes what happened the plane neared the mountain of robold the great bald summit and the four enormous globes of crystal at least we so assume we have winter's word and that of the aviator that they were of the appearance of glass perhaps they were not but we can assume it for description so enormous that were they set upon a plain they would have overtopped the highest building ever constructed though on the height of the mountain and in its contrast they were not much more than golf balls it was not their size but their effect that was startling they were alive at least that is what we have from winters living luminous burning twisting within with a thousand blending iridescent beautiful colors not like electricity but something infinitely more powerful great mysterious mag- nets that huyck had charged out of chaos glowing with the softest light the whole mountain bright- ened as in a dream and the town of robold at its base lit up with a beauty that was past beholding it was new to winters the great buildings and the enormous machinery engines of strangest pat- tern driven by forces that the rest of the world had not thought of not a sound the whole works a complicated mass covering a hundred acres driv- ing with a silence that was magic not a whir nor friction like a living composite body pulsing and breathing the strange and mysterious force that had been evolved from huyck's theory of kinetics the four great steel conduits running from the globes down the side of the mountain in the center at a point midway between the globes a massive steel needle hung on a pivot and pointed directly at the sun winters and the aviator noted it and wondered from the lower end of the needle was pouring a luminous stream of pale-blue opalescence a stream much like a liquid and of an unholyradiance but it was not a liquid nor fire nor anything seen by man before it was force we have no better description than the apt phrase of winters charley huyck was milking the sun as it dropped from the end of the four living streams to the four globes that took it into storage the four great wonderful living globes the four batteries the very sight of their imprisoned beauty and power was magnetic the genius of huyck and robold nobody but the wildest dreamers would have conceived it the life of the sun and captive to man at his will and volition and in the next few minutes we were to lose it all but in losing it we were to save our- selves it was fate and nothing else there was but one thing more upon the moun- tain--the observatory and another needle appar- ently idle but with a point much like a gigantic phonograph needle it rose square out of the ob- servatory and to winters it gave an impression of a strange gun or some implement for sighting that was all coming with the speed that they were making the airmen had no time for further investigation but even this is comprehensive minus the force if we only knew more about that or even its theory we might perhaps reconstruct the the man who saved the earth  work of charley huyck and dr robold they made the landing winters with his na- ture would be in at the finish but charley would not have it it is death bob he said you have a wife and babies go back to the world go back with all the speed you can get out of your motors get as far away as you can before the end comes with that he bade them a sad farewell it was the last spoken word that the outside world had from charley huyck the last seen of him he was running up the steps of his office as they soared away and looked back they could see men the employees scurrying about in frantic haste to their respective posts and sta- tions what was it all about little did the two aviators know little did they dream that it was the deciding stroke chapter ix the most terrific moment in history still the great ball of opalescence brooding over the sargasso europe now was frozen and though it was midsummer had gone into winter quarters the straits of dover were no more the waters had receded and one could walk if careful dry- shod from the shores of france to the chalk cliffs of england the straits of gibraltar had dried up the mediterranean completely land-locked was cut off forever from the tides of the mother ocean the whole world going dry not in ethics but in reality the great vampire luminous beautiful beyond all ken and thinking drinking up our life- blood the atlantic a vast whirlpool a strange frenzy had fallen over mankind men fought in the streets and died in madness it was fear of the great unknown and hysteria at such a moment the veil of civilization was torn to tatters man was reverting to the primeval then came the word from charley huyck flash- ing and repeating to every clime and nation in its assurance it was almost as miraculous as the vam- pire itself for man had surrendered to the people of the world  the strange and terrible opalescence which for the past seventy hours has been playing havoc with the world is not miracle nor of the supernatural but a mere manifestation and result of the applica- tion of celestial kinetics such a thing always was and always will be possible where there is intelli- gence to control and harness the forces that lie about us space is not space exactly but an infinite cistern of unknown laws and forces we may con- trol certain laws on earth but until we reach out farther we are but playthings man is the intelligence of the earth the time will come when he must be the intelligence of a great deal of space as well at the present time you are merely fortunate and a victim of a kind fate that i am the instrument of the earth's salvation is merely chance the real man is dr robold when he picked me up on the streets i had no idea that the sequence of time would drift to this moment he took me into his work and taught me because he was sensitive and was laughed at we worked in secret and since his death and out of respect to his memory i have continued in the same manner but i have written down everything all the laws computations formulas--everything and i am now willing it to mankind robolt had a theory on kinetics it was strange at first and a thing to laugh at but he reduced it to laws as potent and as inexorable as the laws of gravitation the luminous opalescence that has almost de- stroyed us is but one of its minor manifestations it is a message of sinister intelligence for back of it all is an intelligence yet it is not all sinister it is self-preservation the time is coming when eons of ages from now our own man will be forced to employ just such a weapon for his own preserva- tion either that or we shall die of thirst and agony let me ask you to remember now that whatever you have suffered you have saved a world i shall now save you and the earth in the vaults you will find everything all the knowledge and discoveries of the great dr robold plus a few minor findings by myself and now i bid you farewell you shall soon be free charley huyck a strange message spoken over the wireless and flashed to every clime it roused and revived the hope of mankind who was this charley huyck uncounted millions of men had never heard his name there were but few very few who had a message out of nowhere and of very dubious and doubtful explanation celestial kinetics un- doubtedly but the words explained nothing how- ever man was ready to accept anything so long as it saved him for a more lucid explanation we must go back to the arizona observatory and professor ed williams and a strange one it was truly a certain proof that consciousness is more potent far more so than mere material also that many laws of our astron- omers are very apt to be overturned in spite of their mathematics charley huyck was right you cannot measure intelligence with a yard-stick mathematics do not lie but when applied to consciousness they are very likely to kick backward that is precisely what had happened the suddenness of huyck's departure had puz- zled professor williams that and the note which he found upon the table it was not like charley to go off so in the stress of a moment he had not even taken the time to get his hat and coat surely something was amiss he read the note carefully and with a deal of wonder look these up keep by the lens if the world goes up you will know i have not reached the moun- tain what did he mean besides there was no data for him to work on he did not know that an errant breeze had plumped the information behind the bookcase nevertheless he went into the observa- tory and for the balance of the night stuck by the lens now there are uncounted millions of stars in the sky williams had nothing to go by a needle in the hay-stack were an easy task compared with the one that he was allotted the flaming mystery  amazing stories whatever it was that huyck had seen was not caught by the professor still he wondered if the world goes up you will know i have not reached the mountain what was the meaning but he was not worried the professor loved huyck as a visionary and smiled not a little at his delightful fancies doubtless this was one of them it was not until the news came flashing out of oak- land that he began to take it seriously then fol- lowed the disappearance of mount heckla if the world goes up--it began to look as if the words had meaning there was a frantic professor during the next few days when he was not with the lens he was flashing out messages to the world for charley huyck he did not know that huyck was lying un- conscious and almost dead upon the desert that the world was coming to catastrophe he knew full well but where was the man to save it and most of all what had his friend meant by the words look these up surely there must be some further infoi'mation through the long long hours he stayed with the lens and waited and he found nothing it was three days who will ever forget them surely not professor williams he was sweating blood the whole world was going to pieces with- out the trace of an explanation all the mathema- tics all the accumulations of the ages had availed for nothing charley huyck held the secret it was in the stars and not an astronomer could find it but with the seventeenth hour came the turn of fortune the professor was passing through the office the door was open and the same fitful wind which had played the original prank was now just as fitfully performing restitution williams noticed a piece of paper protruding from the back of the bookcase and fluttering in the breeze he picked it up the first words that he saw were in the hand- writing of charley huyck he read  in the last extremity--in the last phase when there is no longer any water on the earth when even the oxygen of the atmospheric envelope has been reduced to a minimum--man or whatever form of intelligence is then upon the earth must go back to the laws which governed his forebears necessity must ever be the law of evolution there will be no water upon the earth but there will be an unlimited quantity elsewhere by that time for instance the great planet jupi- ter will be in just a convenient state for exploita- tion gaseous now it will be by that time in just about the stage when the steam and water are condensing into ocean eons of millions of years away in the days of dire necessity by that time the intelligence and consciousness of the earth will have grown equal to the task it is a thing to laugh at perhaps just at present but when we consider the ratio of man's advance in the last hundred years what will it be in a bil- lion not all the laws of the universe have been discovered by any means at present we know nothing who can tell aye who can tell perhaps we oui-selves have in store the fate we would mete out to another we have a very dangerous neighbor close beside us mars is in dire straits for water and we know there is life on mars and intelligence the very fact on its face proclaims it the oceans have dried up the only way they have of holding life is by bringing their water from the polar snow-caps their canals pronounce an advanced state of coop- erative intelligence there is life upon mars and in an advanced stage of evolution but how far advanced it is a small planet and consequently eons of ages in advance of the earth's evolution in the nature of things mars cooled off quickly and life was possible there while the earth was yet a gaseous mass she has gone to her ma- turity and into her retrogression she is approach- ing her end she has had less time to produce intel- ligence than intelligence will have--in the end-- upon the earth how far has this intelligence progressed that is the question nature is a slow worker it took eons of ages to put life upon the earth it took eons of more ages to make this life conscious how far will it go how far has it gone on mars that was as far the the comments went the professor dropped his eyes to the rest of the paper it was a map of the face of mars and across its center was a black cross scratched by the dull point of a soft pencil he knew the face of mars it was the ascrseus lucus the oasis at the juncture of a series of canals running much like the spokes of a wheel the great uranian and alander canals coming in at about right angles in two jumps the professor was in the observa- tory with the great lens swung to focus it was the great moment out of his lifetime and the strangest and most eager moment perhaps ever lived by any astronomer his fingers fairly twitch- ed with tension there before his view was the full face of our martian neighbor but was it he gasped out a breath of startled exclamation was it mars that he gazed at the whole face the whole thing had been changed be- fore him mars has ever been red viewed through the telescope it has had the most beautiful tinge imag- inable red ochre the weird tinge of the desert in sunset the color of enchantment and of hell for it is so we know that for ages and ages the planet has been burning up that life was pos- sible only in the dry sea-bottoms and under irriga- tion the rest where the continents once were was blazing desert the redness the beauty the en- chantment that we so admired was burning hell all this had changed instead of this was a beautiful shade of iridescent green the red was gone forever the great planet standing in the heavens had grown into infin- ite glory like the great dog star transplanted the professor sought out the ascrsus lucus it was hard to find the whole face had been trans- figured  where had been canals was now the beauti- ful sheen of green and verdure he realized what he was beholding and what he had never dreamed of seeing the seas of mars filled up with the stolen oceans our grim neighbor had come back to youth but how had it been done it was horror for our world the great luminescent ball of opalescence  europe frozen and new york a mass of ice it was the earth's destruction how the man who saved the earth  long could the thing keep up and whence did it come what was it he sought for the ascraaus lucus and he be- held a strange sight at the very spot where should have been the juncture of the canals he caught what at first looked like a pin-point flame a strange twinkling light with flitting glow of opalescence he watched it and he wondered it seemed to the professor to grow and he noticed that the green about it was of different color it was winking like a great force and much as if alive baneful it was what charley huyck had seen the pro- fessor thought of charley he had hurried to the mountain what could huyck a mere man do against a thing like this there was naught to do but sit and watch it drink of our life-blood and then-- it was the message the strange assurance that huyck was flashing over the world there was no lack of confidence in the words he was speaking celestial kinetics so that was the answer cer- tainly it must be so with the truth before him wil- liams was a doubter no longer and charley huyck could save them the man he had humored eag- erly he waited and stuck by the lens the whole world waited it was perhaps the most terrific moment since creation to describe it would be like describing doomsday we all of us went through it and we all of us thought the end had come that the earth was torn to atoms and to chaos the state of colorado was lurid with a red light of terror for a thousand miles the flame shot above the earth and into space if ever spirit went out in glory that spirit was charley huyck he had come to the moment and to archimedes the whole world rocked to the recoil compared to it the mightiest earthquake was but a tender shiver the conscious- ness of the earth had spoken the professor was knocked upon the floor he knew not what had happened out of the windows and to the north the flame of colorado like the whole world going up it was the last moment but he was a scientist to the end he had sprained his ankle and his face was bleeding but for all that he struggled fought his way to the telescope and he saw the great planet with its sinister baleful wicked light in the center and another light vastly larger covering up half of mars what was it it was moving the truth set him almost to shouting it was the answer of charley huyck and of the world the light grew smaller smaller and almost to a pin-point on its way to mars the real climax was in silence and of all the world only professor williams beheld it the two lights coalesced and spread out what it was on mars of course we do not know but in a few moments all was gone only the green of the martian sea winked in the sunlight the luminous opal was gone from the sargasso the ocean lay in peace it was a terrible three days had it not been for the work of robold and huyck life would have been destroyed the pity of it that all of their discov- eries have gone with them not even charley real- ized how terrific the force he was about to loosen he had carefully locked everything in vaults for a safe delivery to man he had expected death but not the cataclysm the whole of mount robold was shorn away in its place we have a lake fifty miles in diameter so much for celestial kinetics and we look to a green and beautiful mars we hold no enmity it was but the law of self-preserva- tion let us hope they have enough water and that their seas will hold we don't blame them and we don't blame ourselves either for that matter we need what we have and we hope to keep it the end the thing from outside by george allen england concluded that marr was dead and the girl alive--that much at all events was solid he could hold to that he could climb back with

case of m valdemar by  edgar allan poe for god's sake--quick--put me to sleep--or quick--waken me--quick--i say to you that i am dead  the facts in the case of m valdemar  of course i shall not pretend to con- sider it any matter for wonder that the extraordinary case of m valdemar has excited discussion it would have been a miracle had it not--especially under the circumstances through the desire of all parties concerned to keep the affair from the public at least for the present or until we had farther oppor- tunities for investigation--through our endeavors to effect this--a garbled or exaggerated account made its way into society and became the source of many unpleasant misrepresentations and very naturally of a great deal of disbelief it is now rendered necessary that i give the facts --as far as i comprehend them myself they are succinctly these my attention for the last three years had been repeatedly drawn to the subject of mesmerism and about nine months ago it occurred to me quite sud- denly that in the series of experiments made hither- to there had been a very remarkable and most un- accountable omission no person had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis it remained to be seen first whether in such condition there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the magnetic in- fluence secondly whether if any existed it was impaired or increased by the condition thirdly to what extent or for how long a period the encroach- ments of death might be arrested by the process there were other points to be ascertained but these most excited my curiosity--the last in especial from the immensely important character of its con- sequences in looking around me for some subject by whose means i might test these particulars i was brought to think of my friend m ernest valdemar the well-known compiler of the bibliotheca forensica and author under the nom de -plume of issachar marz of the polish versions of wallenstein and gargantua m valdemar who has resided prin- cipally at harlem n y since the year  is or was particularly no- ticeable for the extreme spareness of his person-- his lower limbs much re- sembling those of john randolph and also for the whiteness of his whiskers in violent con- trast to the blackness of his hair--the latter in consequence being very generally mistaken for a wig his temperament was markedly nervous and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric experi- ment on two or three occasions i had put him to sleep with little difficulty but was disappointed in other results which his peculiar constitution had naturally led me to anticipate his will was at no period positively or thoroughly under my con- trol and in regard to clairvoyance i could ac- complish with him nothing to be relied upon i always attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of his health for some months previous to my becoming acquainted with him his physicians had declared him in a con- firmed phthisis it was his custom indeed to speak calmly of his approaching dissolution as of a matter neither to be avoided nor regretted when the ideas to which i have alluded first oc- curred to me it was of course very natural that i should think of m valdemar i knew the steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruples from him and he had no relatives in america who would be likely to interfere i spoke to him frankly upon the subject and to my sur- prise his interest seemed vividly excited i say to my surprise for although he had always yielded his person freely to my experiments he had never be- fore given me any tokens of sympathy with what i did his disease was of that character which would admit of exact calculation in respect to the epoch of its termination in death and it was finally arranged between us that he would send for me about twenty-four hours before the period an- nounced by his physicians as that of his decease it is now rather more than seven months since i received from valdemar himself the subjoined note my dear p- you may as well come now d-and f- are agreed that i cannot hold out beyond to-morrow midnight and i think they have hit the time very nearly valdemar i received this note within half an hour after it was written and in fifteen minutes more i was in the dying man's chamber i had not seen him for ten days and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the brief interval had wrought in him his face wore a leaden hue the eyes were utterly lustre- less and the emaciation was so extreme that the skin had been broken through by the cheek-bones his expectoration was excessive the pulse was barely perceptible he retained nevertheless in a very remarkable manner both his mental power and a certain degree of physical strength he spoke with distinctness took some palliative medicines without aid--and when i entered the room was oc- cupied in penciling memo- randa in a pocketbook he was propped up in the bed by pillows doctors d- and f- were in at- tendance after pressing valde- mar's hand i took these gentlemen aside and ob- tained from them a min- ute account of the pa- tient's condition the left lung had been for eighteen months in a semi osseous or cartilaginous state and was of course entirely useless for all purposes of vitality the right in its upper portion was also partially if not thoroughly ossified while the lower region was merely a mass of purulent tubercles running one into another several extensive perforations existed and at one point permanent adhesion to the ribs had taken place these appearances in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date the ossifica- tion had proceeded with very unusual rapidity no sign of it had been discovered a month before and the adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days independently of the phthisis the patient was suspected of aneurism of the aorta mesmerism in this gruesome story by edgar allan poe has again been used as a vehicle for telling us his views about the higher philosophy and the future world mesmerism in another of poe's stories mesmeric revelations is made an agreeable setting for some of his philosophy which he is willing to tell about without forcing it upon us in the too prev- alent modern system but here we find the same author in a somewhat different character it is again mesmer- ism which he employs it is again a bit of philosophy to be told us but the story leads tip gradually and most skillfully to a denouement the most horrifying and terrible in all modern story telling this very short story in its horror is unique  amazing stories but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an exact diagnosis impossible it was the opinion of both physicians that m valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow sunday it was then seven o'clock on saturday evening on quitting the invalid's bedside to hold con- versation with myself doctors d- and f---- had bidden him a final farewell it had not been their intention to return but at my request they agreed to look in upon the patient about ten the next night when they had gone i spoke freely with m valdemar on the subject of his approaching dis- solution as well as more particularly of the ex- periment proposed he still professed himself quite willing and even anxious to have it made and urged me to commence it at once a male and a female nurse were in attendance but i did not feel myself altogether at liberty to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable witnesses than these people in case of sudden accident might prove i therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night when the arrival of a medical student with whom i had some acquaintance mr theodore l- relieved me from further em- barrassment it had been my design originally to wait for the physicians but i was induced to pro- ceed first by the urgent entreaties of m valde- mar and secondly by my conviction that i had not a moment to lose as he was evidently sinking fast mr l-l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take notes of all that occurred and it is from his memoranda that what i now have to relate is for the most part either condensed or copied verbatim it wanted about five minutes of eight when tak- ing the patient's hand i begged him to state as distinctly as he could to mr l- whether he m valdemar was entirely willing that i should make the experiment of mesmerizing him in his then condition he replied feebly yet quite audibly yes i wish to be mesmerized--adding immediately afterward i fear you have deferred it too long while he spoke thus i commenced the passes which i had already found most effectual in sub- duing him he was evidently influenced with the first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead but although i exerted all my powers no further perceptible effect was induced until some minutes after ten o'clock when doctors d- and f- called according to appointment i explained to them in a few words what i designed and as they opposed no objection saying that the patient was already in the death agony i proceeded without hesitation--exchanging however the lateral passes for downward ones and directing my gaze entirely into the right eye of the sufferer by this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was stertorous and at intervals of half a minute this condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour at the expiration of this period how- ever a natural although a very deep sigh escaped the bosom of the dying man and the stertorous breathing ceased--that is to say its stertorousness was no longer apparent the intervals were un- diminished the patient's extremities were of an icy coldness at five minutes before eleven i perceived un- equivocal signs of the mesmeric influence the glassy roll of the eye was changed for that ex- pression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except in cases of sleep-waking and which it is quite impossible to mistake with a few rapid lateral passes i made the lids quiver as in incipient sleep and with a few more i closed them altogether i was not satisfied however with this but continued the manipulations vigorously and with the fullest exertion of the will until i had completely stiffened the limbs of the slumberer after placing them in a seemingly easy position the legs were at full length the arms were nearly so and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loins the head was very slightly elevated when i had accomplished this it was fully mid- night and i requested the gentlemen present to examine m valdemar's condition after a few ex- periments they admitted him to be in an unusually perfect state of mesmeric trance the curiosity of both the physicians was greatly excited dr d- resolved at once to remain with the patient all night while dr f- took leave with a promise to return at daybreak mr l-l and the nurses remained we left m valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three o'clock in the morning when i ap- proached him and found him in precisely the same condition as when dr f-went away--that is to say he lay in the same position the pulse was im- perceptible the breathing was gentle scarcely noticeable unless through the application of a mirror to the lips the eyes were closed naturally and the limbs were as rigid and as cold as marble still the general appearance w-as certainly not that of death as i approached m valdemar i made a kind of half effort to influence his right arm into pursuit of my own as i passed the latter gently to and fro above his person in such experiments with this patient i had never perfectly succeeded before and assuredly i had little thought of succeeding now but to my astonishmnt his arm very readily although feebly followed every direction i assigned it with mine i determined to hazard a few words of conversation m valdemar i said are you asleep he made no answer but i perceived a tremor about the lips and was thus induced to repeat the ques- tion again and again at its third repetition his whole frame was agitated by a very slight shiver- ing the eyelids unclosed themselves so far as to display a white line of a ball the lips moved slug- gishly and from between them in a barely audible whisper issued the words yes--asleep now do not wake me--let me die so i here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever the right arm as before obeyed the direction of my hand i questioned the sleep-waker again do you still feel pain in the breast m valde- mar the answer now was immediate but even less audible than before no pain--i am dying i did not think it advisable to disturb him further just then and nothing more was said or done until the facts in the case of m valdemar  the arrival of dr f- who came a little before sunrise and expressed unbounded astonishment at finding the patient still alive after feeling the pulse and applying a mirror to the lips he re- quested me to speak to the sleep-waker again i did so saying m valdemar do you still sleep as before some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made and during the interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak at my fourth repetition of the question he said very faintly almost inaudibly yes still asleep--dying it was now the opinion or rather the wish of the physicians that m valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his present apparently tranquil condition until death should supervene-- and this it was generally agreed must now take place within a few minutes i concluded however to speak to him once more and merely repeated my previous question while i spoke there came a marked change over the countenance of the sleep-waker the eyes rolled themselves slowly open the pupils disappearing up- wardly the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue resembling not so much parchment as white paper and the circular hectic spots which hitherto had been strongly defined in the centre of each cheek went out at once i use this expression be- cause the suddenness of their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as the extinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath the upper lip at the same time writhed itself away from the teeth which it had previously covered completely while the lower jaw fell with an audible jerk leav- ing the mouth widely extended and disclosing in full view the swollen and blackened tongue i pre- sume that no member of the party then present had been unaccustomed to death-bed horrors but so hideous beyond conception was the appearance of m valdemar at this moment that there was a gen- eral shrinking back from the region of the bed i now feel that i have reached a point of this narrative at which every reader will be startled into positive disbelief it is my business however simply to proceed there was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in m valdemar and concluding him to be dead we were consigning him to the charge of the nurses when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue this continued for perhaps a minute at the expiration of this period there issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voice--such as it would be madness in me to attempt describing there are indeed two or three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part i might say for example that the sound was harsh and broken and hollow but the hideous whole is indescribable for the simple reason that no similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity there were two particulars nevertheless which i thought then and still think might fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation--as well adapted to convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity in the first place the voice seemed to reach our ears--at least mine--from a vast distance or from some deep cavern within the earth in the second place it impressed me i fear indeed that it will be impossible to make myself comprehended as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of touch i have spoke both of sound and of voice i mean to say that the sound was one of distinct-- of even wonderfully thrillingly distinct--syllabifica- tion m valdemar spoke--obviously in reply to the question i had propounded to him a few minutes before i had asked him it will be remembered if he still slept he now said yes--no--i have been sleeping--and now-- now--i am dead no person present even affected to deny or at- tempted to repress the unutterable shuddering horror which these few words thus uttered were so well calculated to convey mr l-l the stu- dent swooned the nurses immediately left the chamber and could not be induced to return my own impressions i would not pretend to render in- telligible to the reader for nearly an hour we busied ourselves silently--without the utterance of a word--in endeavors to revive mr l-l when he came to himself we addressed ourselves again to an investigation of m valdemar's condition it remained in all respects as i have at last described it with the exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration an at- tempt to draw blood from the arm failed i should mention too that this limb was no farther subject to my will i endeavored in vain to make it follow the direction of my hand the only real indication indeed of the mesmeric influence was now found in the vibratory movement of the tongue whenever i addressed m valdemar a question he seemed to be making an effort to reply but had no longer suffi- cient volition to queries put to him by any other person than myself he seemed utterly insensible-- although i endeavored to place each member of the company in mesmeric rapport with him i believe that i have now related all that is necessary to an understanding of the sleep-waker's state at this epoch other nurses were procured and at ten o'clock i left the house in company with the two physicians and mr l-l in the afternoon we all called again to see the patient his condition remained precisely the same we had now some discussion as to the propriety and feasibility of awakening him but we had little difficulty in agreeing that no good purpose would be served by so doing it was evident that so far death or what is usually termed death had been arrested by the mesmeric process it seemed clear to us all that to awaken m valdemar would be merely to insure his instant or at least his speedy dissolution from this period until the close of last week-- an interval of nearly seven months--we continued to make daily calls at m valdemar's house accom- panied now and then by medical and other friends all this time the sleep-waker remained exactly as i have at last described him the nurses atten- tions were continual it was on friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment of awakening or attempting to awaken him and it is the perhaps unfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise to so much discussion in private circles--to so much of what i cannot help thinking unwarranted popular feeling for the purpose of relieving m valdemar from  amazing stories the mesmeric trance i made use of the customary passes these for a time were unsuccessful the first indication of revival was afforded by a partial descent of the iris it was observed as especially remarkable that this lowering of the pupil was accompanied by the profuse out-flowing of a yel- lowish ichor from beneath the lids of a pungent and highly offensive odor it was now suggested that i should attempt to influence the patient's arm as heretofore i made the attempt and failed dr f- then intimated a desire to have me put a question i did so as follows m valdemar can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes now there was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks the tongue quivered or rather rolled violently in the mouth although the jaws and lips remained rigid as before and at length the same hideous voice which i have already described broke forth for god's sake--quick--quick--put me to sleep--or quick--waken me--quick--i say to you that i am dead i was thoroughly unnerved and or an instant remained undecided what to do at firt  made an endeavor to recompose he patient hut failing in this through total abeyaiee of the will  re- traced my steps and as earnestly struggled to awaken him in this attempt  soon saw that i should be successful--or at least i soon fancied that my success would be complete--and i am sure that all in the room were prepared to see the patient awaken for what really occurred however it is quite impossible that any human being could have been prepared as i rapidly made the mesmeric passes amid ejaculations of dead dead absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the sufferer his whole frame at once--within the space of a single minute or even less shrunk--crumbled --absolutely rotted away beneath my hands upon the bed before that whole company there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsome--of detestable putrescence the end the new accelerator by  h g wells concluded preparation is a manageable convenience but its practicability is certainly demonstrated beyond all cavil since that adventure he has been steadily bring- ing its use under control and i have several times and without the slightest bad result taken measured doses under his direction though i must confess i have not yet ventured abroad again while under its influence i may mention for example that this story has been written at one sitting and with- out interruption except for the nibbling of some chocolate by its means i began at  and my watch is now very nearly at the minute past'the half-hour the convenience of securing a long un- interrupted spell of work in the midst of a day full of engagements cannot be exaggerated gibberne is now working at the quantitative handling of his preparation with especial reference to its distinc- tive effects upon different types of constitution he then hopes to find a retarder with which to dilute its present rather excessive potency the retarder will of course have an effect the reverse of the accelerator's used alone it should enable the patient to spread a few seconds over many hours of ordinary time and so to maintain an apathetic in- action a glacier-like absence of alacrity amidst the most animated or irritating surroundings the two things together must necessarily work an entire revolution in civilized existence it is the beginning of our escape from that time garment of which carlyle speaks while this accelerator will enable us to concentrate ourselves with tremendous impact upon any moment or occasion that demands our ut- most sense and vigor the retarder will enable us to pass in passive tranquility through infinite hard- ship and tedium perhaps i am a little optimistic about the retarder which has indeed still to be discovered but about the accelerator there is no possible sort of doubt whatever its appearance upon the market in a convenient controllable and assimilable form is a matter of the next few months it will be obtainable of all chemists and druggists in small green bottles at a high but considering its extraordinary qualities by no means excessive price gibbeme's nervous accelerator it will be called and he hopes to be able to supply it in three strengths one in  one in  and one in  distinguished by yellow pink and white labels re- spectively no doubt its use renders a great number of very extraordinary things possible for of course the most remarkable and possibly even criminal pro- ceedings may be effected with impunity by thus dodging as it were into the interstices of time like all potent preparations it will be liable to abuse we have however discussed this aspect of the ques- tion very thoroughly and we have decided that this is purely a matter of medical jurisprudence and altogether outside our province we shall manu- facture and sell the accelerator and as for the consequences--we shall see the end dr hackensaw's secrets those who read the famous dr hackensaw's secrets in  science and invention
